There are other factors at play, like how willing you are to change and stuff, but things like that slow down your progress, not render your visit pointless. \n\nKeep in mind that people that are dumb, incompetent or plainly underquiped for what's expected out of them can be found everywhere, including therapy. So remain optimistic and if you feel within 1-2 visits that your therapist isn't likely to help you out, switch for a new one. \n\nI went through 8 therapists to find an actually good one and I consider myself lucky in that regard.",

One significant event was something which was making me very sad, and it had to do with a child who was treated improperly.  The therapist telling me he found it \u201cfascinating\u201d that I was carrying guilt for this was something I needed to hear, as it was not my child, nor even a relative, really.\n\nThat was a psychologist.  Also, a few years previous, I found a therapist for depression. (Really really hard to make that first appointment).  The depression improved somewhat over time, but somehow she got me to quit a 30-year cigarette habit as well.",

That meant my therapy sessions were a mix of talk therapy and going over various meditation techniques and various breathing techniques. My homework after therapy sessions was to implement the meditation techniques and breath work when I started feeling overwhelmed. \n\n\nYou can do all of this yourself. That's what self help books and guided meditation videos are for. But it is significantly easier if you also have a third party to voice your feelings to, bounce ideas off of, and who has no actual connection to the things going on in your life. Therapists aren't necessarily there to provide validation. My therapist regularly and very nicely tells me how I can do better and metaphorically kicks my ass into gear. But I like a therapist who isn't afraid to tell me I'm not being great or my best or how I can improve. Think of it like having a personal trainer at the gym vs following a training program you found online. \n\n\nUltimately, therapy is only as useful as you want it to be. If you don't actually implement in your daily life the techniques or suggestions provided by the therapist, then it doesn't do much.",

Ultimately a good therapist will have to push and challenge you; if you don't make any changes to your current way of thinking / being, then nothing is going to change. Just as an example, if your beliefs or assumptions are challenged by the therapist, I can see how this could be perceived as using your words against you. Also, worth noting that therapists are humans too and might say the wrong thing.\n\nThe quality of the therapeutic relationship and building trust is always of the upmost importance, and may be additionally so in your case.

Investing in your mental health is one of the best things you can do for yourself, your partner (or future partner), and your kids (or future kids, if you want any). We all carry some form of trauma, and working through it takes courage. Therapy isn\u2019t about fixing what's \u201cwrong\u201d with you\u2014it\u2019s about understanding yourself better. You will uncover things you might not like, but that is completely normal. No one is perfect.\n\nA therapist\u2019s job (in my case, a behavioral therapist) isn\u2019t to tell you what to do or what to think. Their role is to help you understand why you are the way you are, guide you in exploring how you want to be, and support you in figuring out how to get there. They ask questions, and through answering them, you reach your own conclusions\u2014some will be right, some might not be, but that\u2019s part of the process.\n\nFor example, imagine a man who struggles with intimacy. He finds it hard to open up about his feelings, which creates problems in relationships. He pushes women away when things do not go his way, yet he never communicates what he wants. He believes no one cares, so he sees no point in sharing his emotions. But the truth is, if he has a good partner (and most people are decent), they do care\u2014it is just that he does not believe it.\n\nIn therapy, he can explore why he struggles to trust and open up. Maybe he confided in someone once, and they betrayed his trust. Maybe his dad mocked him for liking pink. Maybe his first girlfriend left him with no explanation. If similar situations happened repeatedly\u2014with parents, friends, or partners\u2014his brain learned to expect betrayal. Now, he assumes that everyone will hurt him, so he avoids vulnerability altogether.\n\nBut the new partner has nothing to do with the past. It is not her fault his ex cheated, yet his behavior\u2014pushing her away, shutting down\u2014ends up hurting both of them. Through therapy, he can unpack these patterns, recognize where they come from, and learn to trust again. When he understands his own needs and feelings, he can communicate them to others, leading to healthier, more fulfilling relationships.\n\nOnce people grasp why they feel a certain way and what triggers those emotions, it becomes easier to manage them. The brain can be reprogrammed\u2014reset to a more neutral state\u2014so that when he meets someone new, he does not automatically assume the worst. If he can open up and express his needs, his partner will actually hear him and respond accordingly.\n\nI recently explained this to a friend who had a bad experience with therapy. She tried online therapy, but her therapist disappeared, and now she feels like she cannot trust any therapist. I get why she is hesitant\u2014people should not just vanish\u2014but that does not mean all therapists are unreliable. Maybe something happened to that therapist; we have no way of knowing. But one bad experience does not define all of therapy. I have been with my therapist for almost two years, and she has never canceled a session.\n\nAfter our talk, my friend realized that therapy is worth trying again. She understood that a therapist\u2019s job is literally to help her feel better, and now she is actively looking for a new one.\n\nSo yes\u2014therapy works. But like anything worthwhile, it takes time, effort, and the willingness to look at yourself honestly. If you are even considering it, that is already a step in the right direction.",

If you have been depressed for a while and you are not getting better with just therapy, they might suggest antidepressants. However they don't work for everyone and they are just a little push in the right direction, they won't cure depression overnight. \n\nPersonally I discovered in therapy that I have ADHD and I'm in the autistic spectrum. I do have medication for ADHD, but it was the absolute last resource, and I only take it when I really get off track with my adult responsibilities. \n\nWith this I want to say that it will be unlikely that you get prescribed drugs straight away and for no reason. You can also say that you don't want them and the reasons why. They should be able to help you get the best treatment for yourself, which might just be therapy :)",

A therapist can definitely help you with that. But it takes time. They aren\u2019t going to magically fix you or give you solutions to this one\u2026 literally just seeing them week in week out and opening up to them and then discovering for yourself that the relationship is a kind, respectful and healthy one, is the therapy in itself. \n\nc) therapists are usually psychologists and they don\u2019t have the qualifications or license to prescribe any medication. A psychiatrist can prescribe meds. But it\u2019s very rare to find a psychiatrist working as a therapist because they are doctors who diagnose and prescribe medication, which is pretty much the opposite school of thought to a psychologist and a therapist who will rarely want to label you or suggest you need meds because their aim is to help you through talking or body work or art or movement or hypnosis or coping strategies, or whatever their expertise is.\n\nIt sounds very much like you\u2019d benefit from therapy. Finding the right therapist is important, so do some reading on different therapies and see what feels right to you. Personally I\u2019d suggest psychotherapy because it sounds like you have interpersonal and relationship difficulties (I don\u2019t mean romantic relationships - I mean any close relationship with another human). The most common and cheapest form of therapy is CBT and I\u2019d suggest avoiding that initially unless of course learning straight forwards coping strategies appeals to you in which case you may find it very helpful. At least you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about a b or c because it would be a fixed 6 or 8 week course and you may even be able to access it for free",
