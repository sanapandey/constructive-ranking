If you are trying to and are quitting, just remember how bad quitting is in the earlier stages and that you are going to go through this bad stuff again if you give in and smoke again. I quit off and on for 5 or 6 years before finally succeeding.",

All smokers will tell you they are addicted, none will freely admit they are addicts because that is exclusively used for class A drugs, alcohol and prescription drugs. I believe that only when you accept you are an addict can you begin to understand the power the nicotine has over you and your power to overcome that. \n\nLook at any basic 12-step program and follow it, the biggest thing is to be compassionate with yourself, it's NOT ABOUT WILL POWER, will power is a bullshit concept designed to make you feel worse if you smoke a cigarette, it's about making a plan and following it step by step.\n\n I also listened to Allen Carrs Easy way to stop smoking. He keeps telling you not to stop until you've got to the end of the book, but to be honest, it was so long. I just decided to quit there and then.",
