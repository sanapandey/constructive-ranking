If it wasn\u2019t an obsession, and didn\u2019t mess with your overall functioning you\u2019re generally ok\n\nThere\u2019s a mental disorder with this as a sole symptom, capgras syndrome/disorder.\n\nOn the other hand, I have schizotypal personality disorder and it\u2019s also a symptom of my paranoia. I\u2019ve experienced these delusions and similar during adolescence and seldom do in adulthood.\n\nNowadays it\u2019s more \u201cwhat if the whole world has been replaced by NPCs?\u201d and an \u201cepisode\u201d like this is pretty rare.",

I was reminded of this stuff that used to happen when I was watching a video earlier so I decided to post it here and see what Reddit thought. It was actually a lot grosser than just imposters as I thought that people were stealing their skin and wearing it, I would ask them personal info to see if they would remember it to prove it was them. Scared me quite a bit but then again I am generally extremely paranoid.",
