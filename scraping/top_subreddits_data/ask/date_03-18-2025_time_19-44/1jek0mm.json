    "selftext": "My mom and I are moving from WA to PA and our plan is to have movers truck our stuff to our new place in PA while we go by Amtrak to there since she has a huge fear of flying right now, but our cats are over the weight limit for Amtrak.  We can\u2019t drive a moving truck with the pets across the country because she has various health conditions that would make that hell, and we would have trouble lining up places to stay that would okay with pets.  We heard about pet moving companies that might be able to bring our 2 cats over for us but we\u2019re not sure which to go with as we've never used any before.  Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.",
