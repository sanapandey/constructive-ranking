    "selftext": "Hello! I just inherited my mom\u2019s Kitchenaid as she bought a new one that\u2019s bigger. This one is around 16-20 years old and in good condition. Is there anything I should be doing for upkeep on it to keep it going as long as possible? \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any upkeep on this at all, but now that it\u2019s mine I want to take good care of it!\n\nAlso curious how long others have their mixers? I know they can live a long time but I\u2019m wondering how long!",

Preventive maintenance would be unpacking all the grease, cleaning the internals, and then repacking all the gears with a modern synthetic food grade grease. Messy job but not too difficult. Tons of videos out there too. Signs you need to do it are if you notice a dark brown oil very slowly leaking out from near where you attach mixing blades to it.\u00a0",

It\u2019s pretty gnarly in terms of power and no safety sensor so be careful you don\u2019t have your fingies in there and accidentally hit the speed switch. I\u2019ve had mine for 5 years and use it about once a week. From what I was told, there\u2019s no upkeep but just don\u2019t leave it in the garage or the attic as temperature changes can affect it. My speed switch also cracked and broke which is probably the most sensitive part, enjoy!",
