    "selftext": "I had decided to buy the Speed Queen washer and dryer.  We went to Bray and Scarf and the salesman aggressively steered us away.  He told my wife that they have a very small wash capacity compared to other brands (which was an immediate no go for her).  It appears to be true.  She began looking them up online and there were a lot of negative reviews saying the washer doesn\u2019t get clothes clean, etc.  \n\nSo what\u2019s the truth?  \n\n",

I bought it for one reason and one reason only, I don't want to buy another washer for 20 years.  If it quits working properly in a few years and costs a boatload to repair I'll never touch the Speed Queen brand again and buy something else.  Thus far, I don't have any complaints and our water bill hasn't gone up at all.",

I tried it on my SQ and it definitely sucked the item down.\n\nWe have not had any cleanliness problems with our SQ washer.",

Unless your trying to wash a full king sized bed worth of stuff at one time it fits plenty. We wash king sized sheets and pillow cases all at once no issue. Capacity means nothing when you have to wash 3 times to get it clean.",

Speed queen has a warranty (mine had a 10 yr warranty) and when the guy came to my house he said that my specific malfunction wasn't covered but that he was going to put the request in because it shouldnt break in 8 months. Fortunately they did cover it. He recommended not going speed queen again...oddly it was another maintenance guy that recommended one to me in the first place. At this point I just assume none of these are made like they used to be and I bought my current GE at lowes with the max 5 yr warranty.",
