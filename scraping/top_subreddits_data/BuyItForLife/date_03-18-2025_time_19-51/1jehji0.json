Those special hangers that allows you to hold multiple items on one hanger. \n\nFurniture that has built in storage spaces. Drawer organizers, special shelves and things like that. \n\nI\u2019m talking for the small every day storage items, like makeup,  clothes, shoes, toys, etc.\n\nAnd everything including up to the big items like special furniture that is made in a way that allows the most space possible. \n\nI\u2019m very unorganized as a person. I genuinely need to have a dedicated space for every single one of my items because if I don\u2019t, I will eventually lose everything and it will all end up being a huge scrambled mess less than 2 days of organizing it all. \n\nI\u2019m trying to be organized and put together but we have soooo much stuff that sort of just sits in the corner because I don\u2019t have anywhere to really put them. I know I can do so much better if i just had the correct items to be able to store everything in and so I always know exactly where everything is meant to be and can always put them back where they are meant to go instead of just tossing it in with everything else. \n\nAny and every possible item you can think about please please share them with me. I\u2019m talking every room in the house needs to have some sort of good storage system going on. For big things as well as smaller things. I would genuinely appreciate any advice, tips, or tricks!\n\nI\u2019m turning 30 in April and im just so tired of constantly being in chaos and feeling like I don\u2019t have control over my own personal space and I\u2019ve come to find out i do really well when I I have dedicated spots for certain things. \n\nIf I don\u2019t, everything just goes everywhere or eventually gets lost or something. I\u2019m ready to finally get serious enough about being better. I\u2019ve been saving up money because I knew for my birthday I wanted to finally buy everything I would need for storage; but I can\u2019t think of the right words to google. I\u2019m getting a few results but I would like a full or better detailed list of all of the different options that are available. \n\nI really appreciate anyone taking the time to read this and hope maybe someone on here can help!",
