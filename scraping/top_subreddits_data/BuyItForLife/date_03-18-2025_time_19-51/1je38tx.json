I have a 45i and 75i and they are excellent. The VOC filter has a crazy amount of carbon in it too to help with smoke. I believe they are also one of the few manufacturers that publish their carbon numbers in their filters. A lot of others don\u2019t.",

We don't have this metric, so anyone helping you with recommendations is actually steering you in the wrong direction as you will be an unsuitably sized unit.\n\nStart with stating the sizing.  If its going to be in a room with the door closed, state that sizing.  If every room in the house will be doors open and you want whole house, state the entire square footage.",
