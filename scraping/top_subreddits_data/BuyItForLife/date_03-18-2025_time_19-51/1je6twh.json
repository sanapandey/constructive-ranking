There are no rechargeable battery powered devices that are BIFL.\n\nAlso, Bluetooth could be phased out for a more reliable form of communication in the future, which is why I, once again, suggested hard wire studio headphones.\n\nYou\u2019re nitpicking my use of the word \u201cobsolete\u201d. I said obsolete because it\u2019s true. If Bluetooth stopped being used tomorrow, your wife\u2019s headphones would be worthless. If the battery goes out and you cannot replace it, then your wife\u2019s headphones would be worthless. \n\nSo battery powered, Bluetooth devices, can and will be rendered obsolete eventually. The only way around this is either 1) get a high quality Bluetooth pair that will last you for as long as possible or 2) get a hard wired studio pair that will last you a life time",

I said that you would need to get High-Quality Studio headphones if you would like to avoid the tech becoming obsolete in time. I am also in this thread suggesting exactly what you offered above. High-Quality Bluetooth headphones that would meet the criteria of Rule 1, with the caveat that things like the battery and Bluetooth would make it not BIFL. \n\nThe 3.5mm jack (headphone jack) has been standard since the 1950s, while it might be disappearing from phones it is not going anywhere and you will always be able to find conversion kits to make things work. I ran a wired headset for years doing this with no issue. \n\nBluetooth on the other hand is still a fairly recent thing, and if you talk to any audiophile, Bluetooth is not the best when it comes to sound quality. I could see Bluetooth being phased out in the future for a higher quality communication method, albeit the battery of the device will probably give before then. \n\nSo I stand by my original comments that Battery-powered Bluetooth headphones are not BIFL, but you can find ones that will last a long time (see my suggestions in other threads). If you want BIFL headphones you need to get a studio pair and compromise on ANC, Wireless, ETC but they will last you a life time.",

That's over 2000 hours per year, probably more as I used them lightly on weekends and evenings too. Certainly over 10,000 hours use to date, still work really well. They have excellent noise cancellation in my opinion, but I haven't tried many alternatives.\n\nMost of those 2000 hours per year involved heavy use of Microsoft Teams - I'm a software developer and I had responsibilities for mentoring my teams, so I'd be on calls with them throughout the day, and business meetings. I often had compliments on the sound quality of my connection from the other end of the calls. \n\nI also enjoy listening to music while writing code and found these to be excellent for that.\n\nThey did eventually (around 2023) develop an intermittent problem of dropping the Bluetooth connection but I'm not sure if that's more to do with the software or hardware on the laptops. I had no trouble on my work laptop when it was running Linux but my home desktop running Linux I did have trouble but I know that machine's Bluetooth adaptor was malfunctioning. However I also had trouble with my later job's MacBook Pro, a newer pair of headphones Sony WH-1000XM5 worked consistently with the MacBook Pro.\n\nOn the flip side, my original headphones still work fine with my personal laptop (Windows 11) and my business laptop (Windows 11 Pro), my development machine (Ubuntu Linux), and my phone (Android). So it's unclear to me why they work with some devices and not others, I think it isn't necessarily the fault of the headphones but of the Bluetooth support in some devices.\n\nBattery life for Sony WH series headphones has been excellent and I've not really noticed any degradation, they charge quickly and retain their charge well. My girlfriend has a pair of WH-1000XM3 headphones which she has also had for quite a few years now and has no complaints.\n\nOverall I've been more than happy with them and have no reservations recommending the Sony WH-1000XM5 which I also own and appear to be just as well made.",

If you have to buy some I would say Sony xm4, but only if you have to. I just usually do not like, in my opinion, overengineered Sony headphones.\n\nI got Bose and they have noise canceling issues and the pads kept on breaking every two years.\n\nTried Sennheiser, but the update seemingly bricked the headphones.\n\nThe newest Sony you can not turn off the noise cancelling and the button layout seems too complicated for me. I do know how it works better than other users, but it dies not seem intuitive at all. It\u2018s the obly one that was the most ok. Did dmnot find it very comfortable though.\n\nSennheiser maybe work if you do not touch the software at all. On paper that one is the best. With sound quality (I liked them), battery life and decent noise cancelling.\n\nNone of them should struggle with Teams.\n\nI do also like the Bose sound, bit the product quality seems like it was planned to break after some years of use.",

Battery is still really strong, can easily support multiple days of use. The leather started to crack, but it's not falling off yet, and I could replace the earpads easily if needed. Also if you want to keep it for even longer, you should wipe it down after each use, and use leather care products on it. Mainly the headband. Otherwise it's still works like it's day one. No squeaking or other noise when I wear it, which was the reason why my previous headset had to go.\n\nThere are newer versions of it (XM4 and XM5) which suppose to be similarly high quality.\n\nAlso, extra point that is has THE best active noise cancelling, as well as top tier sound quality.",
