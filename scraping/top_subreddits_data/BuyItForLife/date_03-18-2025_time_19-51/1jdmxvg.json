And that's it. Unless there is someone who is like \"my grandfather gifted me that exact one and i lost it in a fire. I will pay xx to have another\" and then it's up to you to figure out xx on that person to person basis. Could be $50 could be something ridiculous as \"whatever here's $200 just give it to me\"",

They sell pretty often, so it's not like there's no market and you have to go hunting for a seller.\n\nIt's absolutely not impossible to appraise. I's definitely not worth 200 dollars, and it's definitely worth more than 99 cents. I think it'd be totally reasonable to say it's worth around 50-100 dollars and pricing it in that range puts it right in line with what similar items have sold for.",
