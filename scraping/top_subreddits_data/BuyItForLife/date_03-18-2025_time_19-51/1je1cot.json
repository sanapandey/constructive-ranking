    "selftext": "I love this style of furniture. I googled it, but can't find what it's called. It's basically the style La-z-boy is known for. I read multiple reviews on the sub that they are very bad quality now and use PU leather, and don't know any alternative. \n\nCan you please recommend high quality brands that have office and home furniture in this style? My main priority is comfort and longevity. Preferably genuine leather. I am based in the Netherlands and my budget for an office chair as an example is around 800 Euro. \n\nThank you in advance. ",

That top piece looks like it would support your neck but it just pushed my head forward and was just ridiculously uncomfortable. The chair didn\u2019t last very long either. I honestly couldn\u2019t recommend it.\n\nMy cat liked sitting up there and supervising my work though.",

This makes it feel like you're constantly working to not slide off the front of it. \n\nReally, everything about the chair just make you feel like you're being slowly shoved forward.",

            "body": "In terms of office chairs, models like the one you posted are designed to look really comfy, but in practice, they rarely stay comfortable after years of use. Especially for 800 euro you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a chair that\u2019s made with real leather that will actually last. \n\nIf your main priority truly is comfort and longevity, ergonomic office chairs will be better than this sort of thing. Though they don\u2019t look as fancy, Herman Miller and Steelcase both make extremely high quality furniture that\u2019s designed to be ergonomic and withstand decades of abuse in corporate offices. Admittedly, neither company makes office furniture in the style specified or in your price range, but, they are pretty easy to find secondhand in good condition. \n\nSo, I would strongly look into models like Herman Miller \u201cAeron\u201dor \u201cEmbody\u201d, or the Steelcase \u201cLeap\u201d or \u201cGesture\u201d. These chairs are made to be comfortable and long lasting office furniture, and will simply fill that role better than anything else.",

I work from home and game in it and I never have any pain or get fatigued.\n\nI was nervous when I first got it though because it was very uncomfortable to begin with, but lots of people said there's an adjustment period. I'm glad I stuck through with it.  It took about a month for it to feel really good and now it's superb.",
