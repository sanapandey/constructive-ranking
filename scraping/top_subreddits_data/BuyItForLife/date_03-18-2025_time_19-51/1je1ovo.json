I don\u2019t even have to think about it. My floors just stay clean and I don\u2019t have to do anything but empty the dock\u2019s bag like every 2 months at the most",

The new ones are amazing and auto detects floors or carpet, it will vacuum the carpet and mop the floors. \n\nThe mop will mop your floors then automatically go back to the dock, then it washes the mop, then goes out and mops some more untill all your floors are mopped. \n\nAll you do is empty the dirty water tank and refil the new water tank. They even sell conversion kits and you can see videos of people that hook the tanks up to pipes so it will auto fill the tank and auto drain the dirty water tank so u never do anything and your floors are just mopped every day\n\nI vacuum 5 times a week and mop 4 times a week and have to refill and empty my tanks about once a week\n\nI don't have pets and don't wear shoes inside the house so my floors are pretty clean anyways but Sometimes I'll spill something small on the floor in the kitchen and forgot i spilled it and the next day when I come home from work it's mopped up and gone.

                            "body": "I know I'm not who you asked, but I'll answer with my experience. \n\n**Backstory:** I got one used for like, $40-$60. It was cheap and dumb (-ish, I could contact it to my phone and tell it to go on a timer, but that was it), it only lasted a few months. In using it for that time I found that I absolutely loved it. \n\n**Choosing a vacuum:** I went into research mode and spent more than 40 hrs (true story, I counted so I could tell my dad) reading reviews, watching videos, etc to figure out what kind I wanted to buy. I landed on a Roborock S5 MAX. (This would have been circa 2018-9?) Top of the line at the time. Smart vacuum & mop combo, ~$500. It required basic maintenance and replacing worn out parts (roller brush, spin bristles, washable mop cloths). \n\n**BIFL?** After about 3 years it wasn't suctioning as well as it used to, and I figured it needed some deeper maintenance. I gave it to my dad to take it apart and clean everything. He did and now, in 2025, my parents still have it and they use it at their home. \n\n**BIFL?** I've now moved to a multistory home and have happily purchased 3, 1 for each floor (Roborock S7-vac/mop combo, smart, map saving, smart scheduling, etc, on sale for $400 each). In the last 22 months they have vacuumed ~~1,352~~ 1,352,000 sq ft combined (the most used one on the main floor with the kitchen has over ~~754~~ 754,000 sq ft by itself), and they are still going strong with basic maintenance. (I don't expect them to actually be BIFL, but that's already a pretty great run IMO.) \n\n**Workload:** We have 2 adults, 2 elementary aged kids, and 2 cats and a dog with full-time access to the outside wildlands. I run the kitchen one 2-3 times per day (kitchen crumbs are the worst), and the others on a schedule that makes sense for the use of our house. \n\n**Smart Home/Convenience** I can't imagine how much of my personal time I've NOT had to spend vacuuming or mopping, and they are much more consistent and thorough than I will ever be.\n\n**Messy Home?** Even when our kids were little, the robot starting up was our signal to tidy up, and since it happened multiple times a day it helped us keep things nice. \n\n***If/when one of them goes out, I will 100% buy another flagship Roborock. I will personally choose one with a big/fancy base station for less daily emptying/refilling mop water.***\n\nEdit: Math/Numbers (rounding error) and spelling.",

There's is the factor of keeping its mop washing tray and brushes clean but its so SO worth it for not having to regularly mop the entire home. \n\nFor deep cleanings, I still use a the manual steam mop but the robot vacuum is excellent for day to day dust, hair and random debris.\n\nThough rarely are these types of devices BiFL, i still highly recommend a robot vacuum for anyone who wants more time back in their daily lives.",

It just seems cleaner in general, and it actually reduces the amount of litter you have to buy because it's constantly sifting out the dirty parts but leaving the rest. When I manually emptied/cleaned the litter box, the whole thing would get dumped when I did the full box cleaning so I was buying new litter a lot more often. With the LR I'm just dumping out the dirty bin. \n\nAlso mine has had hardly any technical issues. I am definitely happy with mine and think it's worth the investment, even with only 1 cat. Plus it's peace of mind if you're gone for a weekend or on a trip. Even if you have a cat sitter, I always hate having to tell them to mess with my litter box so this way they wouldn't have to (or if they did itd just be to change out a bag on the device and toss the dirty bag out, super easy).",

You put them anywhere and if water touches them they let out a horrid horrid sound. \n\nOne under the sinks, one next to the sump pump.  One under the tub on the third floor. One next to a common leak under a weird roof line. \n\nWorst best sound in the world to wake up to when our sump pump started to overflow.

No wifi or anything just automatically turns on lights whenever it detects its night time. Great for stair lighting, hallways, and outdoor lights. \n\nMotion sensor lights for bathroom, these switches are just local logic and make a lot of sense especially for those middle of the night bladder empty runs.\n\nHumidity sensor switch for bathroom fan - want to avoid mold? You can install automatic Humidity sensing switches to turn on exhaust fans when it detects moisture. If you have roommates or children who constantly forget to turn on the fan after a shower its a good alternative rather than relying on humans. \n\nThere's lots of middle ground options out there for the enthusiast. Many of the above I installed myself with a little help from YouTube and everyday im grateful for these modern conveniences.",

We got a roomba years ago. It\u2019s hard to keep the floors completely clear, you have to literally take it apart to keep it clean (god help you if there\u2019s cat vomit) and it just does an okay job in general. We\u2019re now looking into stick vacuums because I\u2019m tired of the half ass job the roomba does, plus it\u2019s SO FREAKIN LOUD, I don\u2019t run it as often as I could.",

I say that as a guy with 10G fiber running through my house from floor to floor, and a ton of home automation systems all tied into my own server.\n\nI'll say I don't recommend anyone who isn't proficient at computers to use home automation.  Things break.  There's huge risks with using most consumer systems, and even when you get a good one just losing your internet means you might not be able to close your garage.  I've had people ask me to help them set up a home automation system and my response is always no, because in 3 months they'll be back wanting me to fix it.\n\nBut what has made my life easiest?  The things that blend into the background and don't require thought.  Close the last garage door and 15 minutes later it will turn off the garage light.  Open a garage door after dark and it turns on the garage light and the driveway lights.  The front door deadbolt locks itself every night at 8PM.  String lights on the back porch come on by themselves at dusk and turn off at 10PM.  Front doorbell sees a person, it turns on the front porch light and the front floods.  In addition to the regular scheduled cycles, the pool pump automatically comes on if it gets below 38F to make sure nothing freezes.  Sends my phone an alert if someone leaves a garage door open for 15 minutes.  My doorbell alerts both my phone and my wife's and has multiple speakers in the house announce that someone is at the door.\n\nPersonally I think all the strip lights and tablet controls mounted to walls as a \"smart switch\" are silly.  I don't want to see my smart house, I just want it to take care of things.  And my house works 100% even without Internet.  In fact a lot of it works without grid power for about 25 minutes or more.\n\nBut it all started because one of the kids left the house and left a garage door open with nobody home.",

Plus, with Smart Lighting, I can just turn the lights on and off with my voice rather than getting out of bed to reach the switch.\n\nFinally, it's a weird toss up between the curtains which are solar powered, and open and shut on a timer (although I can have it happen on sunrise or set) and the Tokit Omni Cook, which is like having a personal chef in your house (save for some unsual ingredients on some recipes). I just can't imagine having to open or close the curtains manually ever again.\n\nRing doorbell is only useful for telling delivery drivers to leave the parcel in the designated safe place when I'm not in (which they should be doing anyway)",
