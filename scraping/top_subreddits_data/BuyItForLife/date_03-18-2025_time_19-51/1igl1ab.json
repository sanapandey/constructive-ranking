It often leads to people not realising that comparable and/or better items can be found closer to home, easier, cheaper and free of tolls.\n\nI thought it would be a good idea to crowdsource some manufacturers here for non-American users.\n\nThis isn't neccesarily items made in those countries as some manufacturers use factories across the world but with a commitment to quality\n\nI can start (I'm kind of UK/Euro centric so it would be great to expand this):\n\n**Clothing**  \nPortuguese Flannel - Portugal  \nNaked and Famous - Canada  \nUskees - UK   \nYarmouth Oilskins - UK  \nCarrier Company - UK  \nOld Town - UK (Closing down)  \nFarmer's Market - Iceland (may be hard to buy outside of Iceland)  \nOni Denim - Japan  \nIron Heart - Japan  \nBarbour - UK  \nCompanion - Spain  \nN\u00c4Z\u00a0- Portugal (only women)  \nMeindl - Germany (they run a high quality fashion brand but are known for great hiking boots)\n\n**Outdoor Gear**  \nFj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven\u00a0- Sweden  \nRab - UK (offer a very good repair service)  \n66\u00b0 North - Iceland  \nDevold - Norway  \nBergans- Norway  \nHagl\u00f6fs\u00a0- Sweden  \nKl\u00e4ttermusen - Sweden  \nAlpkit - UK\n\n**Footwear**  \nSolovair - UK  \nMayura Boots - Spain  \nChurch's - UK  \nLoake - UK  \nWm.

I'll try and work my way through and add what I can! Please note that I will only add stuff that I have experience with but all the comments help with crowd sourcing knowledge.",

Tefal and Krups are definitely not BIFL I think. \n\nI just eplied to your comment because it listed WMF and so did the OP. Don't worry about it, we're all here to learn and share our experiences!

This is common with almost any recycled natural fibre so you will rarely see 100% recycled natural fibre content.\n\nIt is better to have a garment that lasts for a lifetime -- meaning the environmental impacts of creating it are paid only once -- versus having something that wears out quickly and has to be replaced repeatedly (pay for the environmental impacts multiple times).  I actually tend to seek out nylon blends for wool items that are thinner or higher-wear, for this reason, because they last *vastly* longer than pure wool.  Using recycled wool also reduces the greenhouse gas footprint vs. virgin wool.  \n\nNylon doesn't have a huge environmental footprint, and because it's one of the strongest & toughest textile fibers you're not shedding a bunch of microplastics like with polyester etc.  \n\nThis is what smart, thoughtful sustainability looks like.  Edit: **this is the exact same reason why Darn Tough Socks uses a bit of nylon in their wool socks, because it *dramatically* increases the durability of the clothing in high-wear uses. 100% wool socks wear out surprisingly quickly.**  100% wool coats wear out too if worn heavily, albeit more slowly -- even when not using recycled wool to reduce environmental impacts.\n\nEdit: **and in fact, [one analysis for carpeting showed that nylon has a lower carbon emissions than wool](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652617322059): 6.35 kg CO2 equivalent for wool carpet, 4.80 kg CO2 equivalent for nylon.  Nylon has a lower carbon emissions than wool for the same output.**  Anian minimizes the emissions for the wool component by recycling, and the combination of recycled wool + a small amount of nylon is both FAR more durable than pure wool (speaking from experience here) AND has a lower environmental impact than 100% newly produced wool or nylon on its own.   Sheep farming for wool has a substantial greenhouse gas impact, just like cattle farming does. \n\nThe fact that people care more about their feelings/gut (\"oh every plastic use must be bad, wool comes from an animal so it is always perfect\") than the actual facts is why sustainability is so hard... and why few companies bother and instead we have tons of throwaway fashion.  **Spreading misinformed takes or nitpicks attacking small sustainable brands is actively harmful to any attempt to make the world a better place.  That is a hill I will happily die on.  You're going after someone's *livelihood* (Anian) by using false claims that appeal to natural biases (\"natural = good\"...  even if the natural process comes with high *natural* greenhouse gas emissions) even when the facts say otherwise.**",

Where do you think the plants that sheep eat get their carbon? When you see carbon footprints for wool production, they are including land-use changes which are simply not relevant for the current state of the wool industry. Land is not being converted to or from its natural state for wool agriculture. The *concept* of carbon footprints was created by petroleum companies for the precise reason of justifying further oil consumption.\n\nUsing nylon is fundamentally not carbon neutral, you are taking carbon from underground and putting it into the biosphere.\n\nIt's just a marketing gimmick. It's so nuts that they are managing to charge those prices for recycled wool and cotton mixed with nylon.\n\nAnd, you just made up the \"nylon doesn't contribute to microplastics\" claim. Nylon definitely does form microplastics:  https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7007202/, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X11005133\n\nAnian doesn't use recycled nylon because it's expensive and they are using the (not) \"circular\" gimmick to get you to pay 300$ for plastic.\n\n\nEDIT: lmao they blocked me so I can't reply to them, I rebutted all their arguments in this comment anyway.\n\n\nDon't fall for Anian, they spend all that extra money from selling you plastic on a million instagram ads claiming they are \"circular\" when they are literally not.",

My set lasted about a year with constant contact with cutting oil.\n\nThe Wiha wing handle torx are honestly consumables with the amount of use they get. Wiha will replace individual drivers for a year if you buy through an authorized distributor like Amazon. The replacement rate for me was about 1 T8 every 4-6 months across 3 sets. That has since been reduced by using a Wera torque driver to tighten the screws.\n\nI highly recommend Mitutoyo digital calipers with a round depth rod and the Quantumike is game changing coming from their standard digital micrometer.\n\nI'll add Citizen sliding headstock lathes as a for fun bonus item. The L20 and C16 models I've run and seen are fairly bulletproof and I'm working on reviving a 1991 L16 that came out of a company's r&d shop in 2020 and sat for a few years.",

The fur is silver fox fur instead of coyote. The down is 800 fill power 90% down instead of 625 fill power 80% down. It's machine washable. It's also lighter and looks better in my opinion.\n\nI've been acquiring 66North pieces for years since I started visiting Iceland.

Meze, Romania are also built like pieces of art and their new models sound like a dream! and Beyerdynamics, Germany are the choice for indestructibility for a reason.\n\nFor tools, PB Swiss and Knippex, Germany, dominate for a reason.\n\nFor knives, Victorinox, Switzerland and Opinel, France are not only top notch but also super affordable, and plenty of small French manufacturers if you want something fancier.\n\nFor clothes, Fjallraven, Sweden deserves the reputation it has, and I'm very happy with my stuff from Seagale, France. If price is an issue, do not understimate the higher end of the Decathlon, France catalogue, it may not be as fancy as the alternatives, but durability is not compromised!\n\nFor shoes, Carmina in Spain deserves a shootout. Same as Scarpa from Italy for more practical shoes.\n\nFor musical instruments, Ibanez, Japan; Sire, Korea; Yamaha, Japan; Cort, Korea make better stuff than the american manufacturers for a lower price, and the custom EU manufacturers like Biarnel, Italy; Sandberg, Germany; DeGier, Netherlands; Adamovic, Netherlands; Mayones, Poland the best!\n\nI know tech is not BIFL but Fairphone, Netherlands makes a repairable phone, and Nokia/HMD, Finland has done some nice repairability upgrades too. Tuxedo, Germany and Slimbook, Spain also sell computers based mostly on Clevo, Taiwan designs that tend to be more repairable and upgradeable than the alternatives.",
