I have a few of their shirts and will probably end up getting more.\n\nEdit: Adding some other brands up here that I personally own and love.\n\nCanada West Boots - Made in Winnipeg. Been wearing a pair of Romeos for a couple years now.\n\nPopov Leather - Made in Nelson, BC. have a few of their leather goods, holding up really well.\n\nMeyer - PEI. High quality made in Canada pots and pans, I have their non-stick 12\u201d.",
