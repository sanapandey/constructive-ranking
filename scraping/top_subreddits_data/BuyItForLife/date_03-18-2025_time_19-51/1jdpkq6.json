    "selftext": "Two years ago I was making a lot of YouTube videos that no one watched. I purchased a Wondershare account after trying to pirate it and getting hacked. The annual subscription is $50, and I've renewed it twice, most recently without my knowledge. That's $150 for a product that I really only used for six months and then sporadically for non-Youtube stuff since then.\n\nI also own a Photoshop version from 2016 that operates without a subscription. I would prefer to use something like this for video editing, but I'm not very good at doing a lot of the editing without templates and other preset settings. \n\nDoes anyone have a recommendation for a video editor that's easy for beginners that I can buy once?",
