    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been haunting this sub while I look to replace a decent but now broken down Amazon bed frame I bought when I first moved to my apartment. I\u2019m debating between the Thuma Classic (which this group loves) and Arhaus (Brock Cane Poster Bed) which this group seems to like as a brand albeit with no specific bed reviews. The all in cost would be about the same with shipping & Arhaus needing a box spring. I\u2019d err towards going with the styling of the Arhaus, but I hate tossing large furniture on every move or after a few years, the waste kills me.\n\nTL;DR \u2014 anyone ever bought a bed frame from Arhaus?",
