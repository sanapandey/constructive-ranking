    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI\u2019ve been casually looking for a 100% leather backpack for a long time, both online and IRL, and happened to come across the Vintage Gentleman Roosevelt Backpack in person on sale for $265 (regular price $400). I know Saddleback is a popular brand on this sub, and I would one day like to be able to afford one, but now is not that time. Have any of you guys heard of vintage gentleman before or used their leather products? I haven\u2019t found a lot of info about them online, but the reviews on their website are really good. Just wanted to see if it\u2019s a hidden gem or no one talks about them because it sucks. Pics attached from the listing and the actual bag in person. Thanks! \n\nLink: https://www.thevintagegentlemen.com/collections/duffle-messenger/products/the-roosevelt-backpack",
