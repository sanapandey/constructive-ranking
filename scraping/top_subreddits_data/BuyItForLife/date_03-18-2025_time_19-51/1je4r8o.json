I know the pictures provided aren't great and I've asked for additional, but just wondering if anyone can tell if these seem legitimate from the photos? Any idea on the age of these? Thanks!\n\n",

As for the age, I'm not confident. V2 dropped in 2006, so if they were well cared for and well cleaned, could go back as far as that. They look to be in decent shape. If the price is right I'd say go in and pick the best.",

Mine has the silver frame like the blue chairs in your first picture. Both sets of chairs look legit from the pictures. There should be a service tag on the bottom of the chair if you want to check authenticity if you go in person.\u00a0\n\nThe place I bought mine was an office furniture reseller. The seller let me try several before choosing.\n\nMy only gripe with the Leap V2 is lack of headrest but the company that makes the popular one for the Aeron is making one for the Leap. The frame of the headrest is black if that helps your decision when buying a second hand leap, but I really like the contrast of the blue and silver chairs in the first picture.\u00a0",

Imo, if you can get these cheap enough, would definitely recommend trying one because there's a good market for them that you can resell it if you decide it doesn't work for you.
