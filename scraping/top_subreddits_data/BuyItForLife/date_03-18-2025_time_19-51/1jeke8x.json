    "selftext": "Hello! I work as a chef and well, I don\u2019t make too too much money bc I also have kids but I was wondering, what are some good and safe pots and pans to purchase that can last me a long time? Im hoping to build my stash up slowly, but I want quality, I want pretty, I want sustainable, and I want durable. I love cooking, but I don\u2019t love my bank account lol. I have the money, but it\u2019s a \u201chave but can\u2019t spend\u201d kinda deal lol. \n\nAnyways, what are some brands or links to things I can purchase? I absolutely love buying second hand, but there aren\u2019t many thrift stores that sell kitchen supplies. Maybe I can check eBay\u2026 but not sure. ",

I usually wait to see what each years piece will be and then buy the one that seems like the best deal/addition to my collection. It\u2019s only taken me 3 years to build up a good selection of pans",
