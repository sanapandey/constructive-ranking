Completely opposite to what you're claiming. \n  \nUntil they attacked Israel following October 7th. And we all know what happened to Hezbollah since then. \n  \nIsrael doesn't just kill anyone they see with a gun. They need to go to certain places and cross certain lines that Israel considers no go lines. I'm guessing the guys were hoping that the drone lost track of which vehicle the weapons were in and where they are headed. \n  \nAgain, Israel doesn't just blow up every car they see. They need very strong evidence and Hezbollah has plenty success moving weapons under the nose of the idf. This just wasn't one of those times.",

Any violation of this allows Israel to act. \n\n> A ceasefire doesn't mean you can't keep manufacturing or supplying weapons to your troops does it? If it does then Israel was never following a ceasefire.\n\nSince ceasefire agreement places no such provisions on Israel, Israel is not violating it. \n\nI have no idea how you even arrived at that conclusion. Do you always use logic for everything you do? Like, you go to take a loan at the bank, they give you 10% interest rate. Do you demand them to give you 10% interest rate on the money you deposit? I mean, it is logical after, right? However, I am sure, for some reason, you are not getting 10% from the bank on your deposits.\n\nEDIT: read the full text of agreement here: https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/full-text-ceasefire-agreement-lebanon-and-israel",
