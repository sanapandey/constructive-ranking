I'm curious what statisticians in war colleges have to say, but I imagine the equation for a soldier's likelihood of surviving a conflict probably only incorporates the quality of their training with a max weight of 5, maybe 10%. Technological disparity; total manpower; ISR; strategy at the command level \u2014 all I wager have a much higher impact on whether said soldier lives or dies. Sure no training can have you dodge bullets or artillery rounds; but one must ask why you're there in the first place and how expendable you are to commanders in achieving that objective. To be pawns in the game of kings is a dangerous game.\n\nThe thing is, what brought this soldier to this moment isn't just their own micro-actions; but a broader accumulation of almost everything leading up to that moment. His death is a result of a collective effort, either rightly (a good sacrifice) or wrongly (a wasted sacrifice). Luck is what we give to life's equations that are too complicated or lacking in known variables for us to solve.",

Bad decisions kill soldiers. You can work around disparities in technology, force of numbers... but only if you choose to. It's very easy, as we've seen, for the Russians to just do human-wave attacks and hope for the best. Those are doctrinal methods for the Reds, but also the commanders are choosing to continue that doctrine at the expense of their soldiers lives instead of adopting new methods to increase survivability.",

Confusion and panic was starting to set in...and then someone yelled \"let's get em!\" - and just like that, without an order the entire unit just *stood up* and walked directly into the ambush, full send across the board.  Guys were firing until the ran out of ammo and then picking up AKs from the dead Vietnamese to keep going.  Some guys were getting sidearm kills.\n\nThey shattered the NVA, killed most of them and sent the rest running, and when it was all over, they realized that apart from some guys who had been hiit right at the start of the ambush, from the moment they stood up, not one enemy bullet had found any of them.  Which, given the fact that they had just all stood up in the middle of an L-shaped ambush and gone for a very murderous walk requires astronomical amounts of luck.\n\nBut that wasn't the weirdest part.  The weirdest part was that although everyone in the unit clearly remembered hearing the call \"let's get em!\"...nobody was willing to take credit for having been the one who said it.",

I'm not sure what that wall is made of (solid bricks? Hollow cinder blocks?) but maybe the bullet impacts and entry points on the left/interior side of the wall are much less destructive than the exit points on the right/exterior side of the wall.\n\nI'll leave it at this: i can't be certain about this because 1) im not a ballistics expert and 2) low quality video, but to me the flying dust indicates the rounds were coming through the wall from the other side. If the original video uploader said \"the bullets were coming from inside the structure\" then i'd believe it because i dont see anything concrete (sorry) that indicates otherwise.\n\nI'm not looking for a debate. I'm just sharing my opinion.",

It looked super fake and silly to me, especially when compared to the stunts modern films pull off with people getting shot.\n\nThen it hit me, those old movies were made by people that survived some serious fucking wars. (WW2, Korea). They knew what happens when people get domed. The body tenses up in a way not possible for a conscious healthy body can. They were mimicking real life.\n\nNow we come full circle, getting 4k drone footage of soldiers getting domed, and the truth is modern Hollywood cinemas lie about death, it's not some glorious instant kill. It's ripping a violent tunnel through living organisms resulting in a whole manner of central nervous system spasms before eventual death.\n\nI look at the modern movies like John Wick etc and just shake my head at the complete fabrication of the effects of weaponry. It's horrifically fake to the point it's outright lying to you how fucking horrific a bullet is.",

Early in the war some smaller units of Russian conscripts were thrown into the fight in Ukraine and there was such a big backlash in Russia Putin personally promised it won't happen again. Conscripts can't even be used in peace keeping missions, as it's against the law. Or just think about this, how many 18-25 years old soldiers you have seen in combat videos during these 3 years? Because that's the typical conscript age. But for this very reason it's always old guys, mostly volunteers from prisons or poor remote areas, often from minority groups.",
