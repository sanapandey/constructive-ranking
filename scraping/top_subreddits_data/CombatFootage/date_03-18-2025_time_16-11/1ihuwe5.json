This is from a fairly reliable Russian blogger, but as always take it with a fat grain of salt:\n\n\n\nEvening of 05.03.25: \"Counteroffensive\" of the Ukrainian Armed Forces near Pokrovsk has begun. Judging by the developments today, yesterday's strike on Shevchenko was the start of Drapaty's counteroffensive.\n\nThis explains the persistence and the quality of the Ukrainian forces involved yesterday near Shevchenko.\n\nToday, the Ukrainian forces continued their advance, noticeably expanding the width of their offensive along the front. By the evening, they have achieved significant tactical successes.\n\nOverall, the plan is what we had anticipated (to cut off the protrusion and encircle Pokrovsk from the south and southwest).\n\nDetails will follow tomorrow, but for now, the situation is tough, yet our guys are holding on. Ukraine, with heavy losses, keeps advancing. Forces involved total up to two brigades from the Pokrovsk side and one from the direction of Uspenivka.\n\nLet's keep our fingers crossed and pray for our guys.\n\nhttps:// t . me / yurasumy/21555",

They then tried to impose those demands to Ukraine, as seen in the recent diplomatic ambush, but instead of Ukraine folding, they just said \"OK, no deal\" and left. I'm firmly of the belief that this was not intended. As Anders Nielsen said in his latest video, it's likely that the plan was that Zelensky would he strong armed into both accepting the US-Russia narrative, and signing the deal.\u00a0\n\n\nThis isn't just a setback in the sense that the American deal collapsed, but also on the fact that future US-led deals are going to be even more impossible going forward. Russia has seen Ukrainian-US relations break down in real time, so it makes sense that they absolutely do not want to negotiate for less right now. Both the Ukrainians and Russians are seeing that US commitment changes constantly, so threatening with less/more aid or less/more sanctions does not have the negotiating power it had before. \"Lines on maps\" made a really good video recently, explaining how in order for the mechanism outlined by the Trump administration to work, it requires that both participants believe in the US commitment to carry out what they threaten to do.\u00a0\n\n\nOverall, this isn't a fiasco just in the sense that the US violated every international diplomatic norm to strongarm their ally, but also in the fact that it completely blew up in the US's face. It's likely that the Trump administration now just realized the impossibility of its own self-imposed task, which means that if any major policy change happens, it's going to be seen soon.",

They could have foreseen that Trump is not making America great again, but small but they said \u201afine with us, as long as we enjoy absolute power over this smaller America\u2018. It\u2019s now coming back at them. In the past 20 years 2/3 of the world\u2019s countries have changed from having US as their primary trade partner to now doing most trade with China. Nobody bought American cars for their quality or US grain because there is no substitute for it. The one stake in the ground and reliable basis for continued trade and relationship that the US had with other countries was it\u2018s political alliance based on shared Western values and the reliable offer to protect this alliance with the biggest arsenal in the world. If that\u2019s all gone now and the US is becoming just another authoritarian regime which offers nothing beyond a pure business transaction, then all what counts is the global market price and the US won\u2019t win this, since they can not even match the continuity and reliability of other countries. Trump is driving the remaining US trade partners into Chinese arms with tariffs and the dissolution of US military alliance. He\u2019s accelerated US global retreat to a record speed. A big question is what the economic fallout will be from it. US has monopolised few technologies, but hardly enough to change the trend of a Chinese century. Also US economy critically relies on foreign investment and whether these will continue flowing amidst trade wars and isolationist foreign policy is more than questionable.",

Now what if Trump remembers that those forever war quagmires are what he wanted to keep the US out of in the first place? What if he realises that he can\u2019t achieve his fast cease-fire and loses all interest in the whole thing altogether? The way I see it there is a realistic chance that he will stop any US spending on Ukraine but leave the whole thing to the Europeans to solve (who seem to love Zelenskyy more than him anyway) including letting them buy weapons from the US to forward them to Ukraine. After all Trump is a narcissist with a short attention span, not a sociopath with an end game.

The West + USSR basically flooded Iraq (the weaker side in the conflict) with equipment, this forced Iran to accept a peace deal. And neither side had captured significant % of territory in that conflict near the end.\n\nFailing to make a peace deal to then let Ukraine collapse will make Trump look bad though. Will not affect his ratings that much, but it will be a blow.

I dont know enough about macro economics to know if this is solid, but the US is running on a deficit each year, and each year they increase their debt and the amount they need to pay on that debt yearly. He doesn't want to increase corporate taxes, because that will hurt US companies ability to compete internationally. And he doesn't want to tax the rich, because they would just \"leave\" on paper. So the alternative is to cut national spending. (Or inflation, but they are already doing that).\n\nAnd the defence sector is one area he is looking at reducing. To keep the military industry going, he needs Europe to buy more of that surplus. And he needs government employees over in the private sector, hence tariffs on imports which will create new business opportunities in US. Since he is going to cut in defence, he also need Europe to be a stronger ally in the Nato -therefor the pressure for Europe to increase defence budgets.\n\nSo Europe is in a bind. We didn't have a lot of defence before since we relied on NATO/US. Much of what we had, we have given to Ukraine. Now we both need to increase defences, support Ukraine and all the while the European economy is stagnant. The upside is that Russia is in a worse condition, but they are also more used to living in a worse condition. How will Europeans be able to handle a decrease in quality of life? Will they understand the long term consequences of short time peace deals?\n\nIf Ukraine falls, Moldova would probably follow (no Nato there). Fico has already said they might pull out of EU and NATO, and an aid to Orban said that \"they would not resist the Russian army if there was an invasion\". If Russia can flipp the next election in Romania as well, then I would expect to hear the same from them. In Georgia people are in the streets fighting for their own independence.\n\nThe largest country in Europe + the second largest country in Europe + 3-4 other eastern European countries as vassal states or fully included in the Russia federation? The power balance in Europe would be shifted for sure! The Soviet Union/Russian empire would be back.\n\nUkraine is the European wall right now.\n\nThat's what the west looks like to me right now, but I would appreciate other perspectives.",

So, and in spite of the nonsense words that he said today even, I don't think he will want to allow Putin to win in Ukraine.\n\nThat said, European powers absolutely need to be preparing for the possibility that he might, and be prepared to fight that war (literally or otherwise) ourselves.",

Modern ATGMs are effective but if you get hundreds of drones for the price of one which would you take? Ukraine produced 2,2 million small drones last year + started their mass production of long range drones as well. This year we can bet the numbers are going to be greatly increased both in quantity and quality. The key parts here is in millions. In big wars you do nothing with small quantities of anything.

Intrestingly, their bridgehead over the Oskil river seems to have been contained for the time being\n\nOfcourse thats still too slow for whatever it is Russias goals are at the moment, and its even worse for them how they lost both Kotlyne, Pishchane and most of Lysivka by Pokrovsk\n\nRussia will never stop attacking, but there will be (and already is) a decrease in attacks compared to earlier. That could mean they will attempt a massive attack somewhere soon so theyre saving up a bunch of dudes and armor for that. I know people will say \"but Russia doesnt have anything left\", and I would be careful with those statements since everytime that is thrown out there, we get things like the Avdiivka offensive in october 2023 or the extreme infantry assaults on Chasiv Yar and Toretsk (which still hasnt been captured funnily enough)",

The war itself is not very popular with Russians and while they pretend consent in public, the increasing sign up bonuses are a clear indication of war fatigue. In the end most ordinary Russians seem more afraid of the negative consequences of Russia never ending this war or only ending it on unfavourable terms and with Russia never fully recovering from its consequences. Putin has for 3 years bot managed to fully convince his people of this war and most will be happy when it\u2019s over sooner rather than later. I also doubt that there\u2019d be civil unrest and disapproval of the bloodletting and sacrifices, since after the vast majority signed a contract and went there voluntarily. The Russians who have outlived them, will just conveniently turn their back on this painful chapter of their history and put the sole blame for their deaths on the individuals who did it for the money. Never underestimate the stubbornly just-get-on-with-it attitude of ordinary people and their total lack of compassion for what their neighbours did for money.\n\nNevertheless there is a political risk for Putin that comes with a ceasefire. Forcing troops to recommence fighting after a ceasefire and failed negotiations, can easily go wrong. I think this is the true reason why the Kremlin will not agree to pause. They are probably aware that they\u2019re not very able to control ceasefire compliance and secondly have bigger worries of not being able to restart the war after a pause.",

Without a steady connection for course correction, the glide bombs tend to stray and harmlessly explode on some fields.\n\n>The jamming has even resulted in the Russians bombing themselves. \u201cThere were cases when glide bombs did not reach the territory of Ukraine and fell on the territory of Russia or on temporarily occupied territories,\u201d Kazarian said.\n\n>*\u201cAll high-value targets are guaranteed to be covered by \\[electronic warfare\\],\u201d Fighterbomber claimed. It might take eight or even 16 glide bombs to reliably hit one target, the channel added. And while the glide bombs are inexpensive for a precision munition\u2014each costing around $25,000\u2014the Sukhoi jets that lob them two or four at a time aren\u2019t cheap.*\n\n>Launching four jets to maybe hit one target is risky and inefficient for an air force that has just a thousand or so modern jets, and has already lost 120 of them in action in Ukraine.\n\n>The intensive Ukrainian jamming has also grounded many of Russia\u2019s drones. Night Watch\u2019s earliest efforts focused on forcing down Shahed attack drones that routinely strike Ukrainian cities.\n\n>Radio jamming has effectively accomplished what the Ukrainian air force largely failed to accomplish with its expensive, vulnerable S-300, Patriot and SAMP/T surface-to-air missile batteries, which can hit Russian jets from scores of miles away but were always too few in number to fully protect the front line and safeguard Ukrainian cities.\n\n>The Russians jam, too, of course\u2014but Russian jamming doesn\u2019t have the impact that Ukrainian jamming does. Many Russian jammers are badly made and ineffective. Likewise, Russian industry hasn\u2019t yet been able to develop a countermeasure against Ukrainian countermeasures against Russian munitions.",

Any kind of deal will never be accepted by both sides, so the talks feel a bit pointless\n\nWhats a bit ironic is that the term \"breakthrough\" can only be attributed to two events of this war, namely the Kharkiv offensive in september 2022 and the Kursk incursion last august. Even when Russia attempted to blitz through the border by Kharkiv/Belgorod in may last year, they got stuck 5 km into it and is still there to this day. \n\nPoint being we need an genuine breakdown of the Ukrainian forces for Russia to achieve their beloved breakthrough and theres no signs of that as of now, cause at the moment the quickest Russia can advance is in walking phase. Same goes for Ukraine for that matter. \n\n(Kherson offensive november 2022 was more akin to a Russian withdrawl from extreme Ukrainian pressure and supply issues rather than a breakthough in the line. Same for Soledar and Ocheretyne where Ukraine basically abandoned the towns due to rotation mistakes)",

This means Russia has taken the entier part south from Pokrovsk and down to Vuhledar and will now either move a lot of those forces to the actually city-battle for Pokrovsk, or we will see them move into Dnipropetrovsk oblast for the first time\n\nToretsk is more or less captured too, the biggest town to fall since Avdiivka. Chasiv Yar is like 90% captured, but Ukraine somehow still holds some highrises in the west\n\nRussia crossed the Oskil river, aiming to take Kupiansk from the north. How they managed to cross and develop a relatively large bridgehead there is quite odd to me.\n\nKursk hasnt seen much movement, but Russia took Sverdlikovo and started to mess around at the Sumy border. They also took Nikolskii with the help of the North Koreans, but they had to retreat due to no supplies so Ukraine holds it again\n\nUkraine took back a little bit south of Pokrovsk. The Russian forces in this area is apparently very exhausted and were kicked out of Pishchane, parts of Kotlyne, Dachne and most of Lysivka. Ukraine also captured Cherkasskaya Konopelka in Kursk\n\nDespite the advances, the Russian assaults and general units on the front is in the worst state its ever been. Its also curious how Ukraine managed to not only stop Russia outside of Pokrovsk, but also push them back in some places\n\nAll of this is best seen on deepstates map [https://deepstatemap.live/en#6/49.4383200/32.0526800](https://deepstatemap.live/en#6/49.4383200/32.0526800)",

I think the very ham-handed way currently being pursued, of trying to get Europe to up its military production, is bad of course, but I think all this is actually being done in service of the war that is coming between China and the US. \n\nIn other words, I think the idea with the US taking this approach is basically us saying \"We need you guys to steer the ship in Europe, we have to be ready to fight China with everything we have.\"\n\nSo, in that sense, I don't think that you have to necessarily worry about US withdrawing military aid in a scenario where China is attacking. Not that there wouldn't be a lot of other things to worry about then.\n\nCurious on other peoples thoughts, but this is essentially what Elbridge Colby said in the 2018 National Security Strategy. \n\nI admit I am not highly informed of all the intricacies though.",

Those days are obviously over now, but there was a deeply held belief in the 2010s that Russia was no longer a real threat and that sense was widespread not just in Europe but in the US as well. Trump whining about NATO spending never had anything to do with him foreseeing some invasion being imminent and trying to warn Europe about it, it was the same posturing and bullying that he does with everyone about everything to try and make himself look tough.\n\n\nBesides all that, this concept that \"if NATO members states just spent more we could have healthcare\" is such a nonsensical statement. First of all, the US already spends more on healthcare than most of Europe does. We're not unable to give our people free healthcare because we're broke and can't afford it, we're unable to do it because our government is captured by corporations that profit off of the present system and lobby to keep it the same. Secondly, the party complaining about NATO is the same one that increases defense spending and cuts taxes to the rich every time they're in power. They have never offered any real solution for healthcare and they don't actually give a shit what Europe spends on defence, it's just political pandering that has never been backed up by real action.",

That big bump in \u201c%gdp spent on defense\u201d has nothing to do with NATO\u2026 in fact, NATO countries often help the USA when called upon. The \u201clegacy\u201d of the USA \u201cspending a lot more on defense than others in NATO\u201d is bullshit because for so many years, the USA was doing massive defense spending yes.  For the benefit of NATO\u2019s interests?  No.  Spending a bunch in the pacific, in Korea, Japan, Israel\u2026 Trump and Trumples like to pretend there is this big \u201cspend debt\u201d and they need someone to blame\u2026 so why not blame Europe?  *Blame Canada!* lol \n  \n  \nFor a NATO country, almost everything it is going to spend is in the interest of the alliance in some way.  And now, the US has in the last 3 years spent much less in direct aid (of all kinds) to Ukraine than the dollar figure it spends there would lead one to believe.  Sending old equipment that is penciled in at higher values than it is worth because it is EOL and needs decommissioning eventually is *a cost*, sure.  But you can pay to decommission and dispose or you can ship it to Ukraine? \n   \n  \nAll the while, keep in mind that the replenishment of the USA\u2019s arsenal is seen by stupid people as part of the cost involved with supporting Ukraine.  The **obvious** problem with such an assertion is what?  The USA is spending money in its own factories and paying its own people with noteworthy economic benefit to the US.  It\u2019s backfeeding the US economy.. which is honestly great.  But let\u2019s take honest stock of the situation.  \n  \n\n  \nI guess I\u2019m glad you\u2019re creating the space where this perspective can be brought in the open.  \n  \nAnd back to what I was saying\u2026 the US sending aircraft carriers all over the planet and building its own iron dome is going to show as percent of GDP spent on defense.  Consider the USA has home base, a western ocean, and an eastern ocean.  Is it reasonable to look at its spending and consider that perhaps 30-50% of its spending has anything to do with NATO?  It\u2019s not preposterous.  The US is a defense spending behemoth, but this is the first administration that is crumbling in the face of finally putting its defense material to work for the exact purpose NATO exists\u2026. North Atlantic area territorial defense.  Trump is clearly a good salesperson for the stupid, but why is much of what he\u2019s doing conspicuously working in Russia\u2019s interest?   Once Russia starts full scale invading into Europe, suddenly Trump want the US to be a middle man between Europe and Russia and not to take sides.  Huh.  Kinda sus.  It\u2019s probably going to hurt the US the next time they\u2019re looking for friends and their former allies say \u201cthese unreliable fucks don\u2019t need allies, they need a middle man\u201d.",

What people in your party do is combine every national defence budget, point to their own, and say why do we have to spend so much on defence? Which makes no sense, as most of those dollars go towards American wars that have nothing to do with Europe.\n\nThere is no shared account stuffed full of American dollars that is then emptied by selfish bureaucrats in Brussels. There is no great subsidy, outside of being under the American nuclear umbrella, which, again, is in the interest of the United States to control. The United States could leave NATO tomorrow, and the Republicans would likely agitate for an increase in their defence budget, not a cut.\n\nAnd of course no one is laughing now.

I personally think there are a lot of money men in america (e.g. twat billionaires like bezos, reptile man etc) behind the scenes who are terrified of that because they know the more the EU is fucked with the more danger their tech companies are in (hello EU commission, in addition to stuff like the Musk/Tesla effect from the general populace).\n\nCould always go his usual undermine NATO route, as countries like Baltics/Poland etc really don't want american troop withdrawals but he also risks making those countries more belligerent if he does (and again, less dependent on america, which reduces negotiating power). The EU is looking to spend a trillion+ or more into their own defence which we can thank trump for, but we can also thank him for that being spent domestically, cos these countries sure as shit are going to avoid american defence companies like the plague.\n\nBut the mineral deal isn't a ceasefire, a peace plan, or even a negotiation with russia. None of that shit has even begun to start yet (and yes russia is still hurting badly right now).\n\nEventually we will get to negotiation stage, russia will say \"no\" to everything - like returning territory, people or allowing peacekeepers and then we will really see how much trump likes to gobble putins balls, with any luck the americans will then finally direct some of their ire at the delusional cunts that actually started this whole war.\n\nOtherwise, I really hope Germany does rearm adequately, like that opinion isn't unpopular or rare, as funny as it sounds for years country like UK and France have wanted Germany to do a lot more defence wise. Would also be cool if Merz had the balls to give Taurus to Ukraine, but he might see that as a potential negotiation upset at this point...\n\nThen again in 4 years, if trump and republicans haven't turned usa into even more of a banana republic and the general population grows brain there could be a democrat president who will be hostile to russia.\n\nEven better putin could do the universe a favour and finally fuck off and die.",

So US brokering a minerals deal but then not protecting said deal when push comes to shove with Russia, is completely likely and realistic. Don\u2019t forget that Trump does not really plan ahead and is very eratic. The minerals deal is welcome PR to show the MAGA crowd that he made Ukraine pay back for alleged trillions of US aid, but when it does not materialise to even a billion later on, the the orange man will simply omit that and never mention it again.\n\nOr he might lash out against Ukraine again, blaming them for promising, then not giving minerals that they have known of being in Russian territory and out of scope.

After the Cold War, mostly conservative governments have shrunk the armed forces and used the peace dividend to fund expansive bureaucracy, tax cuts, welfare and pension raises. Now money is scarce and the running parties for the election try to avoid the topic where increased Defense spending should come from. The conservative centrist and most popular party can\u2019t even make the numbers work for 2% Defense spending without breaking its own debt or tax increase dogma. The reigning chancellor even accuses the opposition party of using defense spending for hard social budget cuts, with the side effect of creating this defense-welfare dichotomy in voters minds and making defense spending even less popular. Some parties outright deny the necessity, others argue with manipulated numbers, the most vocal candidate propagating higher Defense spending, ranks 4th by popularity and is basically shunned by other parties and large parts of the population. The majority of German politicians are complicit with a population and voter base that prefers to ignore the threat rather than come to terms with the hard decisions that it forces us to.\n\nAnd this is not only true for Germany. I see that except for the Baltic countries, most European countries suffer from second hand war fatigue and unwillingness to sacrifice wealth for deterrence.",

I wrote a bit about it yesterday in this thread, but there has to be something seriously wrong with the Russian units here since they let Ukraine back into the city.\n\nA russian blogger said the reason for this is because the Russian MoD (military of defense) declared the town as captured prematurely a month ago and then moved resources away from the city. Now they seemingly doesnt want to admit the city is still contested, so the Russians there cant stop Ukraine from moving into it from multiple angles. Its also a good sign for Ukraine that their units are seemingly in a decent shape here.\n\nAlso, Russia moved the 150th Guards Motor Rifle Division into Toretsk recently. They have not been rested since 2023 and is in a horrible state after pushing in Kurakhove. Is there really no one else they could put there?\n\nEdit: Ukraine is still holding parts of Chasiv Yar aswell currently.

Russia has little storage capacity and Ukraine has attacked some of these facilities with drones in recent weeks.\n> The output cuts could start small, with Russia's production slipping below 9 million barrels per day (bpd) in the coming months, but may accelerate if tanker shortages and refining outages persist, the executives said.",

But that again ignores that Russia is catastrophically inefficient in using them so far and that even their slightly bigger outputs don\u2019t win them the war for as long as they are waging it with a significantly higher loss rate than Ukraine.\n\nConsider too that serious tank factories can not be planed and opened within a month.

The only reason why Russia can get away with their current meatwave tactics is that Ukraine has nearly zero control of the air near the front. We saw in Iraq (both times) what happens when conventional ground forces meet air superiority, and it is extraordinarily ugly for those on the ground. Russia has about 1/5 of the military aircraft as NATO, and the US has more 5th generation fighters than the rest of the world combined.

They also added that sufficient firepower would support the mission to \"monitor and shoot those attacks down\" to reopen Ukraine's airspace and allow commercial flights.\n\n>The purpose of this support is to ensure that \"whatever forces are deployed will not be challenged by Russia,\" a source told the newspaper.\n\n>According to the Telegraph, Starmer will urge Trump to keep U.S. fighter jets and missiles in NATO countries in Eastern Europe ready to respond to any future Russian aggression.\n\n\u25ab\ufe0fPeacekeepers would not go to the battlefield, but would protect strategic cities, ports and infrastructure facilities (for example, nuclear power plants);\n\n\u25ab\ufe0fEuropean military forces will conduct technical surveillance - reconnaissance using aircraft, satellites and drones;\n\n\u25ab\ufe0fPatrols will be organized in the Black Sea;\n\n\u25ab\ufe0fThe mission will include weapons and technical means to repel possible Russian attacks;\n\n\u25ab\ufe0fThe US will provide fighters and missiles to protect European peacekeepers and facilities in Ukraine from Russian air strikes. The aircraft are stationed in Poland and Romania;\n\n\u25ab\ufe0fNATO members are considering what to do regarding Article 5 of the treaty, as Russia could respond with a strike on the territories of countries that have joined the peacekeeping mission.",

What they\u2019ll do instead is just leave it unanswered to silence it. Starmer\u2018s approach despite lacking domestic backing goes in a right direction. Trump and Putin have used Europeans passivity against Ukraine and an own viable European strategy is the right way to answer. Russia can not win unless also Europe drops support. And that support is outside of Trump\u2019s control. Without Europeans and Ukrainian approval Trump\u2018s plan will simply fall through. Ukraine won\u2019t agree to an unjust plan and can thus simply force a European involvement, therefore also a European say in this matter. Euro leaders just need to finally get their act together and speak as one. \n\nIt\u2019s not that likely though that major European countries will sign up for sending troops, given the high chance of taking casualties from rogue missiles. Civilian air traffic proposal sounds outright laughable after MH17 and JS-8243.",

The city in question is Toretsk (aka Dzerzhinsk, its old name). Its happened before that the Russian units in these areas recieve less resources since their job is \"complete\" because someone was too eager to parade the Soviet flag in the streets and interview the civilians on state TV about how poorly the Ukrainians treated them, rather than actually completely capturing the place. This is also connected to the fierce and effective defense and resistance Ukraine is putting up in Toretsk, so all credit to the units there. Full post below:\n\n*I remind you of the following message posted on the official Ministry of Defense channel on February 7:*\n\n*\"As a result of active offensive actions by the units of the 1st, 9th, and 132nd Guards Separate Motorized Rifle Brigades of the 51st Army and the volunteer formation 'Veterans' of the 'Center' military group, the city of Dzerzhinsk in the Donetsk People's Republic was liberated.\"*\n\n*Meanwhile, according to reports from the ground, Toretsk (i.e., Dzerzhinsk) was not taken. As of February 22, the situation around the final push against Ukraine in the city generally looked like this:*\n\n*\"Here, it\u2019s a mess. Instead of new ideas and tactics for the fight, there are hysterics and the burning of resources with no benefit.\"*\n\n*Who and why needed the false report about the liberation of Toretsk? (The version with cleverly misleading the enemy is not suggested. More likely, someone else is being misled repeatedly.) Is the Ministry of Defense aware that the message from February 7 did not match the actual situation on the ground? Does the Ministry of Defense realize what excessive losses are caused by these accouncements, especially when it concerns a large settlement, and how this foolish burning of resources affects the ability to carry out future operational plans? Have any alternative channels been established for cross-checking the information coming in the reports from the headquarters of units and formations?*\n\nhttps:// t . me / philologist\\_zov/2092",

Then ofc no NATO, neutral Ukraine, give back Kursk salient and probably even Zelensky to step down - that is all crystal clear from their stance. But what are they willing to compromise on? We all know their pinky promise to not invade on is not worth paper it's written on and I just don't see anything they are actually willing to offer as part of honest negotiations. I am also quite hopeful that US side are not a bunch of complete buffoons and will see through their bullshit.\n\nEDIT: wait, they would also want those sanctions lifted unconditionally, there is also that, see, too many demands from RU.\nMORE EDIT: and sure as hell they wont agree to pay any reparations either.",

Quite the opposite he will probably blow the same horn as Putin and just hype up the RuAF and how much of a terrible much worse fate for Ukraine can be prevented by having the Russians put their guns down.\n\nIf that is not enough, Trump administration will basically phrase it as \u201ajust going back to Minsk treaty\u2018 with different demarcation lines, but same situation (Ukraine without security guarantees or boots on the ground, no NATO membership and Russia having some of their territory) and use the Europeans own previous agreement to silence their criticism against the new plan. Logic: if Europeans could live with Ukraine losing Crimea and Donezk back then, they can live with Ukraine losing some more territory now. And even though that is an implicit legitimation of Putin\u2018s landgrabbing, this argument will stick.\n\nThere are disruptive forces at work in European democracies and many of the EU governments would like to move past this war which makes their leaders look inept and and turn to other things on their agenda. Trump will have willing partners across Europe in just letting the sands of time cover what is essentially an injust peace for Ukraine and possibly borrowed time before another Russian invasion.",

It shows how weak he is and easily manipulated.\nWith that in mind, I think US sees 80-90% or even a bit higher of the Russian demands as a solid outcome of the negotiations. Meaning no Ukraine in NATO, no territory returned, more more claims of Ukraine on these territory, perhaps even a disarmament of Ukrainian units, change in politics.

And how does it impact you or others personally to have people of every color be represented in important places? Unless you prescribe to the notion that they are not qualified. Should it be enforced? Depends on the amount of racism in your society.\n\n  \nI live in a predominantly coloured(80-90 percent) neighbourhood. You know what people do here? They work. They go to school. There is no more crime than 30 years ago. And if they work, they contribute. \n\n  \nPeople who are racist never think they are racist. Because all they think is rooted in reality right? Lazy unqualified immigrants. Taking the jobs, homes and not contributing enough. I'm not saying you're racist, but you should entertain the possibility that there are unfounded ideas there that lead the same kind of resentment you see in the US.",

Do you know why Russian demands got so much stronger in more recent years? That indicates to me that they see themselves as winning. Which seems obvious to me as all they need to do is continue the status quo until their larger population lets them win the stalemate by default and they get the entire country. But I'm arguing with redditors that insist Russia is losing and will collapse any day now, but that seems delusional to me. \n\nSo are you in the camp of continuing to pump money in and hope the stalemate miraculously breaks before Ukrainians go extinct or the direct US intervention camp.

To get there, he will coerce and pressure which side seems easier and more vulnerable to that and it might as well be the Ukrainians. Vance\u2018s threats of military action in any direction don\u2019t disprove that by an inch.\nThe Trump team very visibly displays that it does not have the patience and will to follow a Ukrainian strategy of sitting this out until Russia collapses.\nFor Ukraine, things are becoming increasingly difficult now.",

Not pro Assad, I don\u2019t glorify dictators, but I did see the (Islamist) rebellion as a threat to a secular nation. Yes a nation that houses torture chambers, this was all known as the US had some black sites inside Syria to interogate supposed terrorists. \nI still think the Arab spring, or at least the support by the west, was a big mistake. Libya is destroyed, split in two opposing groups led by warlords and slavery has a large presence. ISIS like terrorists got all the room they got. \nI was glad Russia joined the war in Syria and hoped the war would end soon. It did led to a victory for the SAA, although very costly. Russian propaganda, anti Western NATO propaganda was rampant. I went along with it in the beginning, convinced the \u201cMSM\u201d was lying to us all and were extensions of the western governments.\nPeople on twitter became zealots. I noticed their behavior started to change. At first they were \u201cnobodies\u201d like me, and slowly their reach on twitter became larger and larger. I had more then 15k followers on twitter. \u201cWow look at me\u201d. It was the same for others, but like I said their behavior changed. I\u2019m sure some of you know Geroman on Twitter. I know him from back in the day. In the beginning he was very precise in updating maps, not just taking every pro-SAA/Russia tweet as the absolute truth. But within a year it changed.\nAnother person was Vanessa Beeley. She suddenly got a large podium on Twitter in advocating that the White Helmets were just a propaganda machine. That they were all armed rebels pretending to help people.\nI did my own research on the White Helmets and back then I concluded, based on public Facebook pages, that at least 10%, is or was an armed rebel. Less then 50% had pro Al Nusra (and even some ISIS) posts on Facebook. But that was it. I talked to Vanessa on my outcome, she refuted it immediately and said I was falling for the propaganda and they were all evil men. I remember saying her that I believed that a lot of people do want to help, but she ignored me after that.\nThe echo chamber was denying barrel bombs, while video footage was available. It denied the bombing of markets and hospitals. I shrugged and sometimes went along thinking it was an accident or it had to contain a high value target. I must say, the pro-Rebel propaganda also did their work, everything they said was also taken for granted (another echo chamber). It gave me a valuable lesson: journalists had become activists, and activists had become journalists. Was there any neutral news source left?\n\nDuring the war Russia invaded Crimea. I went along with their propaganda, also thinking Maiden was a NATO ploy to get rid off Russian influence.\n\nAfter the battle for Aleppo and defeat of ISIS I was done with it and deleted my twitter account. It was actually quite nice instead of being on Twitter so many hours a day and going through all those propaganda posts.\n\nI\u2019ll continue in the next post",

Russia is going to start a war, that\u2019s bullshit I was thinking. They would never do that, it\u2019s just fearmongering by the West.\n\nAnd lo and behold, they did invade. Oh shit, they actually are, but why? I was convinced that the Russian Army was very strong and Ukraine corrupt and weak, so I was hoping the war would be over in a few weeks and not much people would be killed or houses destroyed.\nAnd then Russia got stuck at Kiev. Oh that must be a ruse I was convincing myself. The real attack is to just liberate Donetsk and Luhansk and then Russia stops.\nWeeks later Russia pulled out of the north. They said it was a gesture of good will. But I saw the videos of all the destroyed material, the stories of poor logistics, the videos of the massacres at Bucha. For me the Russian propaganda veil was starting to slip.\nSuddenly a blitz of Ukrainian brigades taking back Kharkiv oblast and pushing east. I was amazed. Wow the Russian army is actually really weak? What is happening here?\n\nI started to check other sources and it became obvious I had fallen for the Russian propaganda machine. One thing that helped them is that I was stuck in an echo chamber. Once I got out of it, it was so obvious and I felt very stupid. But it also gave me a new purpose to counter Russian propaganda.\n\nWhy do I share this story? I hope I showed how people can be stuck in an echo chamber, but that it is never to late (at least for some of them) to get them out of there. So keep trying just that my friends",

I thought (almost) bloodless taking over of Crimea, although morally unjustifiable, was Putin being master strategist and just securing Russian interests.\n\n\nBut then the war in Donbas flared up and lots of people started dying, and I couldn't believe he'd let it just go on. He got the prize - Crimea - it's an amazing achievement - he could have kept it forever at almost no cost back then. Why wouldn't he now stop it, pretend to be a peacekeeper and be done with it? Russia eas flush with oil&gas money, could have rebuilt itself into something new before it runs out of hydrocarbons and/or the world switches away from it.\n\n\nThen I watched Russians celebrate the shooting down of \"another Ukrainian large transport plane\". Then I saw reports of a civilian airliner being shot down (MH17) and, in a matter of a single day, all pro-Russian accounts celebrating the shootdown went blank - there was a media cleanup operation happening before my eyes.\u00a0\n\n\nIt was followed by accusations that it was Ukraine that shot it down, including some ridiculous photoshop of a Su-25 on top of a google maps image \"allegedly captured by Russian spy satellite at the time of shooting\". I remember trying to explain to a friend that the size of the plane from the photo would make it a kilometer long but the answer was \"well, it's flying close to the camera\". No, satellite are really high, the altitude of a plane is so little comparatively that this makes no sense - I drew a diagram to explain but my friend just jumped to another conspiracy theory answer, not even acknowledging the previous one.\u00a0\n\n\nThat's when I slowly started realizing how much of the whole Russian media sphere is completely controlled propaganda, and not really comparable to the west. Echo-chamber effect on top (on all sides) with very, very few people ever willing to reconsider their opinions.\u00a0\n\n\nThe other eye-opener for me was staying in Poland for work during '15. The amount of hate for the Russians was completely unexpected, and the idea that it was \"NATO expanding east to spite Russia\" became completely laughable once I found out what Poland had to do to force NATO to accept them in, and why it was so important to Polish people.\u00a0\n\n\n\n>\u00a0Once I got out of it, it was so obvious and I felt very stupid.\n\n\n...and, paradoxically, that's what makes you wise!\n\n\n> Why do I share this story?

It's essentially nothing, less than what the Americans give to the Israelis every single year. What dishonest American nationalists do is combine every national defence budget, point to their own, and say why do we have to spend so much on defence? Which is a ridiculous statement to make\u2014they spend so much because of wars their own country started, and because of security commitments outside of the Atlantic they previously made, and continue to uphold because it is in their perceived national interest.\n\nThere is no shared account stuffed full of American dollars that is then emptied by selfish bureaucrats in Brussels. There is no great subsidy, outside of being under the American nuclear umbrella, which, again, is in the interest of the United States to control. The United States could leave NATO tomorrow, and the Republicans would likely agitate for an increase in their defence budget, not a cut.",

If aid is continued then Russia has incentive to keep fighting to ensure more leverage at the bargaining table. I don\u2019t think their objective was to capture all of Ukraine, since their initial invasion force was under 200,000, so if some concessions will make them stop killing, I support that. \n\nI think the most logical step is to try to negotiate peace now, before Russia can increase their already large advantage on the battlefield.",

Only weak authoritarian regimes that don't have the support of their people collapse like that, like Syria did a month ago. \n\nSo before you downvote me you can go through my comments right back to day 1 of this invasion and you'll see I've supported Ukraine the entire time, but you have to face facts - Ukraine is exhausted, Russia is advancing, there's zero chance of Ukraine ever being able to take back Crimea and the other conquered areas. At this point it's just young men dying from a country that already has below-replacement birthrate and is about to have their land and resources raped by Blackrock, so every day the war continues now they're going to lose more land to Russia and more future money and resources to American corporations.\n\nThey've done great, they've done what Finland did in 1939, Ukraine is side by side in the history books with the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae, but it's over.",

Instead of driving directly towards Pokrovsk like they did at the end of last year, they started moving on the flanks where Ukr reserves are having a hard time being rotated in. Saying notably reduced is a bit dishonest when there are still attacks going on all along a 1,000km front as we speak.\n\n\"Russia's interest rates are over 20%\"\n\n\\-Agreed that the situation there isn't peachy but guessing a country's capacity to withstand total breakage during wartime is almost impossible. There are so many factors we can't see.\n\n\"Russia's armored vehicle stockpiles have been drastically reduced\"\n\n\\-True for some, especially the dinosaur platforms like the MT-LB, but not for other critically important systems like T-series tanks and BMP-3. Shortages of APCs and medevac vehicles are present on both sides but it's not going to cause operational collapse.\n\n\"Russia's supply of willing troops is reducing\"\n\n\\-Perhaps, but on an objective level they still have much more manpower to use against Ukraine than Ukraine does against them. Saying Russia's manpower is dropping but Ukraine \"still has 18-25\" to conscript totally ignores the fact that Russia also has that age group left to pull from and if Ukraine starts sending their youngest men to the line, they're not going to have a generation to rebuild the country with. What's the point of holding land if you don't have men to make kids to live there.\n\n\"Russia's only exports are oil and wheat, oil production being bombed\"\n\n\\-Russia is the world's largest exporter of wheat, it isn't their second largest export\n\n((\u00a0[Crude Petroleum](https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-product/crude-petroleum/reporter/rus)\u00a0($122B),\u00a0[Refined Petroleum](https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-product/refined-petroleum/reporter/rus)\u00a0($52.1B),\u00a0[Petroleum Gas](https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-product/petroleum-gas/reporter/rus)\u00a0($39B),\u00a0[Coal Briquettes](https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-product/coal-briquettes/reporter/rus)\u00a0($27.2B), and\u00a0[Gold](https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-product/gold/reporter/rus)\u00a0($13.6B), exporting mostly to\u00a0[China](https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-country/chn/partner/rus)\u00a0($129B),\u00a0[India](https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-country/ind/partner/rus)\u00a0($66.1B),\u00a0[Turkey](https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-country/tur/partner/rus)\u00a0($31B))\n\nWhile Ukraine's strikes into Russian territory to hit refineries are incredibly impressive, the amount of long-term damage they're causing may not be enough to put a noticeable hitch in the Russian oil industry. You need 2,000lb bombs hitting those refineries, not 100lb drones. If you have good data on this let me know because it's a bit difficult to find definitive proof of an effect on the oil exports or lack thereof.\n\n\"Until Russian will to continue this pointless, expensive invasion is exhausted\"\n\nA point that has been predicted ad nauseum over the last 3 years and yet never reached. The light at the end of that tunnel may be a train...\n\n\"Russia has suffered over 700,000 casualties in Ukraine. Even in an authoritarian state, there is a limit to how many deaths a populace will accept in pointless war before they revolt.\"\n\nAgain, something we don't know. 200,000 casualties to the Western mind is almost unfathomable. Russia lost 10 million *dead* against the Nazis. A large portion of those were Ukrainians obviously but if we're sitting and debating which side is more willing to be ground down to a nub then I don't think that's good for the future of Ukraine. I've been watching this war since the literal minute it started, the webcams of GRAD barrages going into Kharkiv and the columns pouring over the Kakhovka dam. No one thought Ukraine would be here. 99.99% of analysts said this would be over within a month. The first week, every headline was \"Ukraine survives another night\". For every claim that Russia was about to collapse, an equal number of claims said the same thing about Ukraine and yet they are still around through persistent equipment shortages, impossibly complex logistical problems, and a fight against a foe with many battlefield force multipliers in higher numbers than Ukraine has access to. This cannot go on forever. Time being on Ukraine's side may operate on a bell curve, not a continual rise.\n\nP.S.: The viet cong was largely destroyed during Tet, the perception that the US lost the vietnam war to farmers is ahistorical. Hanoi had the most sophisticated air defense system in the world and fielded conventional units against the ARVN. The PAVN won the war, not the Viet Cong.",

How soon is soon? The notion that no country can survive a mobilized economy forever isn't controversial.\n\n-\"Go watch Covert Canal's video, almost all the remaining stored tanks are in terrible condition.\"\n\nSome, like the MT-LB and BTR-D. Not others. Here's a direct quote from the CC video I'm assuming you're talking about: \"For all BTRZs, as far as throughput, unless you're sitting outside these factories watching every train coming and going and counting each vehicle, it's hard to know for sure. Backlogs, except for that increase in 2023, are not very obvious. It's more likely that tanks and other vehicles would wait at their storage bases until there is space at the BTRZs before being sent out. So it's not like we're going to see huge parking lots just getting fuller and fuller of vehicles but from all available evidence, it does seem that Russia is able to keep up with repairing and shipping out replacement vehicles. Repairs will take longer and longer as they reach the bottom of the barrel, Russia still has a decent amount in storage as we know and at least for right now, they're able to keep up replacing losses, but that won't last forever. It's just a matter of if Ukraine can hold on long enough.\"\n\nand from the ISW (doesn't seem like this is factoring in new production either)\n\nThe British International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) estimated on February 10 that Russia lost 1,400 main battle tanks (roughly four tank divisions' worth) and over 3,700 infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) and armored personnel carriers (APCs) \u2014 totaling 5,100 lost tanks and armored vehicles in 2024.[6] Data from the Ukrainian General Staff indicates that Ukrainian forces damaged or destroyed over 3,000 Russian tanks and almost 9,000 armored vehicles in 2024, and IISS' estimates likely only account for destroyed tanks and armored vehicles.[7] IISS assessed in February 2024 that Russia would be able to sustain its then-rate of vehicle losses (over 3,000 tanks, APCs, and IFVs annually as of 2023) until February 2026 or 2027 by refurbishing vehicles from Soviet-era storage facilities.[8] It remains unclear if the Russian military command will remain willing or able to sustain this increased rate of armored vehicle losses in 2025, as Russian forces appear to be adapting their tactics to limit such losses.\n\nI'm not sitting here trying to tell you Putin is capable of pulling 1000 T-72B3Ms out of his ass with his coffee every morning but if you're implying that systems shortages will cause collapse, they're not out of the wrong systems yet. Even your own source admits that. Do you think Ukraine can take another 2 years of this?\n\n-Which should be obvious from the fact they're using motorbikes and 1950s tanks for assaults.\"\n\nAgreed that it's utterly ridiculous that their troops are using motorbikes, less so on the T-55. It's still a big gun with armor that can be used as a SPG and Ukraine is also using them. M-55S variants from Slovenia are in Kursk. As it relates to the bikes, it's not all they're using and it may be that a motorbike or quad bike is the only available option for any chance of success on the attack due to the sheer amount of drones around Toretsk/Pokrovsk. We know both sides switched to a lot of small-unit tactics as the war progressed and the civilian vehicles may just be the ultimate manifestation of equipment shortages and tactics changes resulting in outright circus scenes. If I was a Russian playing devil's advocate here, I'd say \"At least Russia is still on the attack\". Battlefield initiative, even with motorcycles, may be better than a completely static line. We also unfortunately see that sometimes these tactics work much better than a BTR-80a covered in a squadron getting absolutely smacked by drones over and over and over again until they're all dead.\n\n-\"Ukraine is fighting a war to defend its very existence, which is easy to justify conscription for. Russia doing an invasion to get territory for Putin is much harder to justify, and Russians only accept it because the main casualties have been volunteers, criminals, and ethnic minorities.\"\n\nEasy to justify conscription for you as a westerner not fighting in the war, yes.\n\nhttps://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-serviceman-attacked-at-military-enlistment-office-in-kharkiv/\n\nThis is three attacks on draft offices in the last month. Hopefully they're all SBU sabotage but this isn't a trend you want to see increasing. Ukraine also rolled out a recruitment program for 18-24 this week.\n\n\"Starting Tuesday, Kyiv is now enticing young people to join the army with lucrative military contracts, offering a million hryvnias (about \u20ac23,000), social benefits and elite training for volunteers who sign up before they turn 25. But this decision has angered some Ukrainian soldiers who voluntarily joined the army and are still serving despite no prospect of demobilization in sight \u2014 while not getting the same benefits as those offered to the youngsters. \u201cThe state devalues \u200b\u200ball those who voluntarily joined the army at the beginning of a full-scale war,\u201d\n-\"Russians only accept it because the main casualties have been volunteers, criminals, and ethnic minorities.\"\nI'm reading this as Russia hasn't had to dip into anyone their population would care about while Ukraine is moving into their youngest demographic available for recruitment. In what world does that paint a favorable picture for Ukraine? Again, we're just speculating on the breaking point of a population that has shown itself time and again to be perfectly willing to apathetically exist with the whims of the madmen in charge. \n\n\n-\"Russia has made it clear they want to genocide all of Ukraine. Putin wants all of their land and has said so. If Ukraine doesn't win this war now and concedes territory, they'll be fighting another war for their heartland in 5 years time. If they lose that, their nation gets oppressed, raped and murdered, or scattered across the Earth.\"\nDepends on what happens over the next few months. If you can predict what Trump is going to do, you'd be the greatest analyst on Earth. Hegseth said yesterday that NATO membership was unrealistic but Vance said today that the US would station troops in Ukraine if Russia didn't accept the peace deal being offered so who f***ing knows lmao. I agree that Russia will do this again if given the opportunity but I believe the solution to that is a strong peace rather than 2, 3, 4 more years of war. The fact of the matter is that Ukraine doesn't have the operational capability to retake any of the land it has lost besides local counterattacks and it doesn't have the manpower to sustain that operational capability even if it did. \n\n-\"In a DEFENSIVE war against an enemy who publicly claimed they wanted to genocide the Russians. And when they had the whole population of the entire USSR to draw from, not just Russia. Here, the situation is the opposite. Ukraine is the one defending its existence, which gives enormous benefits to morale. Compared to Putin's war which requires him to talk to Tucker Carlson for an hour about the Kievan Rus' to poorly justify it.\"\nTrue, and yet Russia's population is still 4x that of Ukraine. Just more guessing and playing with ratios here. Putin's jaunt with Tucker was likely to disseminate Russian propaganda to American audiences rather than to justify the war to anyone. Putin has been justifying this for over 11 years through both words and actions. Notice how the war isn't about denazification anymore.\nAs I said earlier, when we're arguing over breaking points rather than tangible battlefield successes, I don't think that bodes well for Ukraine in the long run. If they can't recapture territory, then they need time to rebuild their military and allow Europe to refill their stocks. They've been shell hungry for 3 years. \n\nSorry if I missed anything, we're discussing quite a bit.",

I was misremembering by 1000, but on the other hand trends for February were also lower than January\" Again asking for a source besides you just saying deepstate. Deepstate maps doesn't have a month to month counter that I can find. \n-\"Look at other major modern near peer attrition-based wars to get a rough idea. World War 1, with its enormous expenditure of men and materiel, lasted 4 years. Active phase of WW2 was about 5 years. Korean War lasted 3 years. Russian Civil War lasted 3. Iran-Iraq 2. Greek Civil War 3, etc.\" Sorry but this is a pretty dumb equivalency to make. You're cherry picking wars to suit your narrative and they're not really good examples. Iran-Iraq was 7, not 2. Was China not part of the active phase of WW2 in your opinion? How many wars went on until the larger power totally crushed the smaller one?  I'll ask again, how soon is soon? You keep saying 2 years like that is light work for Ukraine and Europe. Yes, that's 2 more years of Russian attacks and losses of Russian equipment. It's also 2 years of manpower shortages and rotation issues for Ukraine. That's almost a repeat in length of all the war that has taken place since the front lines hardened. Again, predicting war lengths based on monetary factors is almost impossible. Russia doesn't just explode when their SWF runs out. \n-\"Look at the graph. Sub-1000 tanks in any remotely working condition, and mostly bad, estimated in storage.  So at absolute best according to your source's estimation they've got 2 years left of refurbished 1950s tanks that will most likely break down in the middle of an open field. Keep in mind also that estimate is an entire year old, Covert Cabal's assessment that the situation is a \"looming disaster\" is a month old and based on current info.\" You need to actually read your sources, that graph says over 3000 left in storage, only 150 of which are T-55. The estimates of salvageable materiel are, let's be honest, guesswork from sat imagery. It might be good guesswork, but it's still a guess. CC has a 15 second caveat in the video you're quoting about this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8CcuVCDEUw), and that we don't know what level of repairs Russia is willing to go to for each hull which makes those guesses even harder. This Perun video goes over it in much greater detail than CC does and as he says at the end, extrapolating timelines is complicated and the shortages will vary by system. The number is between 3000-7000 tanks and IFVs with between 40-80% of those being unserviceable depending on many different factors and the methodology being used. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzR8BacYS6U. Tactics can adapt both before and after shortages hit. \"2 years of 1950s tanks left that will break down in an open field\" is a dramatic mischaracterization of the source and is a bad faith representation of the argument I'm making. They have AT LEAST 2 years of varying eras of equipment to be refurbished, depending on what system we're talking about. It's not just platforms from the 1950s. I am not saying this is a good thing for them, obviously, but it's not nothing like you seem to think. Not discounting the work Ukraine has put in destroying all these vehicles either. Covert Cabal's argument 2 years ago was that Russia would run out of tank crews before tanks because they just had so many.\n -\"Nations under existential threat from invaders have survived a LOT worse and carried on fighting to successfully remain free.\" History is also full of crushed nations that were swallowed up. I don't draw 1:1 pictures from past examples and I don't listen to arguments that do either. -\"They have no other practical choice. If they don't win now to break Russia's back\u00a0\" How do they win besides more stalemate, which in turn is a war of attrition that they don't have the manpower for? Ukraine has no operational capacity to attack at scale. They can only lose land and hope that Russia's appetite will eventually grow smaller than what they are gaining. Every city lost is a continual undermining of bargaining power. Currently, rotational issues lose Ukraine villages. How long until those expand to whole lines of defense? I agree we'll be here again without security guarantees, that's probably up to Europe no matter if this war goes on for another 2 years or ends next week because Trump isn't going to sign anything with Ukraine (not a fan but that's the reality). If the US was still providing support I'd probably agree with you, but that isn't happening anymore unfortunately. Which is why Ukraine needs peace to recover and Europe needs to realize that the US is probably decoupling because we have the faux strongman in chief.\n -\"Dumb post. If my homeland was under attack by a raping, murdering invader I would be 100% behind joining up and conscription.\" If you were rooting for a country on the internet you would too. Maybe Ukrainians don't feel the same way as you: https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-war-conscription/33275293.html https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/3/ukraine-conscription-age-row \n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to see calls for Ukraine to lower the mobilisation age, presumably in order to draft more people, when we can see that previously announced [Western military] equipment is not arriving on time,\u201d Dmitry Litvin, an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, posted on X.\"\n-\"Putin knows this war would be unpopular to the point of destroying his regime if he started conscripting Muscovites to die on the frontline en masse. World War 1 made this clear by ending the Russian empire. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was a major factor in accelerating the decline of public trust in the USSR, when everyone knew someone who had died in that war for nothing. Putin knows his history very well and this is why he will avoid conscription en masse, because the most important thing to him is the survival of his regime, much more important than winning in Ukraine.\" Over 100,000 men that were conscripted in October that are currently fighting in Kursk with the North Koreans and no they're not just prisoners and minorities. He's already started this process. Conscription in the Russian empire lasted 200 years, the Soviet-Afghan war lasted a decade. If you're banking on total collapse of Russia as the remedy to this situation then you should evaluate how insane that sounds. I'm not ignoring any of your points, just pointing out that you saying Russia has only used prisoners and minorities up to this point is like the same argument that Z-heads make for why they're actually holding back. Which side do you think has a larger pool of poor rural men to pull from over the next 2 years?\n-\"The great majority of the population are depoliticized yes. That does not mean they will actually do anything to\u00a0support\u00a0Putin in the event that a starving minority rise up, or the oligarchs decide Putin has become too expensive for them. Look at what happened with the Wagner rebellion, barely any interior Russian troops put up any resistance and many Russian citizens welcomed it; it was only by Prighozin's miraculously stupid decision to stop before Moscow (possibly due to Putin having his family hostage) that disaster for Putin was averted.\" There are hundreds of ethnic groups in Russia and each is a very small minority, 4 in 5 Russians are European. Banking on the Tatars taking down Putin is just fantasy, good lord. As far as the Wagner rebellion, Prigo stopped because he realized his position was untenable. Kadyrovites were in Rostov ready to start fighting with Wagner and OMON + whatever units were around Moscow had set up roadblocks at the bridges in the towns south of Moscow. There were military units ready to fight Wagner, they just didn't reach them.  He took a sucker's deal hoping Wagner wouldn't get disbanded as was planned and he got killed for it.\n -\"They don't need it, they just need to last longer than Russia's political/economic ability to garrison the whole Ukrainian border (as well as their own, lest they suffer another Kursk). Once that dissipates, even token offensive capability will be enough to dislodge Russia.\" \"Once that dissipates\" doing all the lifting here. Kursk was intended to draw pressure away from the Donbas. It's now another meat-grinder front where both sides incur insane casualties while Pokrovsk is still pressured and Kurakhove just fell. Kursk is a symbol, not a cog in the Russian war machine. \"They don't need it\" is just a wild thing to say, really. \n-\"I can draw scenarios from history all day where a vastly larger military occupier was dislodged from a country with a much smaller population.\" And they will almost exclusively be examples of long, asymmetrical wars where the defender has extremely favorable terrain (mountains, swamps, things to disappear into). Stories of this kind in total, conventional war typically come from individual battles. Inb4 \"muh winter war\". I can point to many more examples where a bigger foe ate a smaller one. Again, this is a dumb argument to make either way.\n -\"In what way has he successfully created a real reason that this war is meant to be worth the cost to the average Russian? That's the point here.\" Watch 1420 by Daniil Orian on youtube for the answer to this question. Depends on the generation. What you think is real is not what the average Russian think is real.",

You did absolutely cherry pick wars but thank you for admitting you just googled stuff. Each of those is not 1:1 with Ukraine and it's a reddit historian move to try to bring up in a conversation. The february revolution is a little bit more complicated than just being caused by World War 1. The mentality of the Russian as it relates to Putin is not comparable to the mentality of the Russian as it relates to the Tsar in 1917. You are leaving out like 2 centuries of imperial history. \n3. You keep trying to prove to me that conscription would be unpopular within Russia, I am aware of this. My point to you is that Russia is on year 3 of not having to dig deep into \"unpopular\" conscripts while Ukraine is beginning to mobilize younger demographics. You are arguing for a war of attrition where Russia collapses and I am showing you that the numbers don't favor Ukraine any more if at all than they favor Russia. \n4. Are you qualified to give an answer on a topic as complicated as how a country could stretch a SWF or use bonds to pay for war for a longer time, because I'm not and I don't think either of us can fully appreciate the breadth of that issue and how it could be manipulated given that modern monetary practices always seem to find ways to materialize money, even at the sacrifice of the future of the country. Maybe you are and you can be more precise as to exactly what would happen.\n5. You use a lot of generalizations and assumptions about what can and cannot be repaired that the sources you link aren't willing to use because they know these things exist in a grey area. Russia has the ability to repair tanks. The amount is somewhere between the numbers I gave, which you reiterated. I guess the tank point no longer matters though because all the tanks die to temu drones in one second so why are we even discussing how many they can pull out? Challenger point is just a joke, moving on. \n6. Yes, I'm going to go with \"Bigger army will win a war of attrition in a conventional war with traditional front lines if the defender's largest supporter withdraws their materiel aid\" as opposed to \"Well, look at this asymmetrical conflict from 100 years ago, Ukraine could do something like that.\" You're banking on \"not necessarily\" in war, you're not proving anything wrong. Just trying to find lines to draw across historical timelines instead of giving any real data or strategy. \n7. \"As if Ukraine would recover while Russia sits idle\": According to you, Europe can pick up the slack that the US is going to leave if it withdraws all support. Europe can't re-arm Ukraine during a period of peace? Isn't Russian industry anemic to the point they can't build tractors? Do you really not believe the West could rebuild Ukraine's army faster than Russia could rebuild their own? As far as Russia lithifying lines, that has already happened. Ukraine lacks sufficient anti-air systems to bring engineering vehicles to the front line to clear minefields and at this point Russia has probably permanently ruined the land in the grey zones with the sheer amount of explosives within them. I don't know why you think it matters that the land would be mined given that you think Ukraine doesn't need an offensive capability but whatever.\n8. Calling women and mothers in the articles I sent you \"shirkers\" is uhhhh..... okay. I know you're calling me a Russian shill.  I'm assuming you already looked at my posts to try to find something to be mad at. Feel free to find my comment 2 years ago where I called this exact scenario (minus being wrong on Ukraine joining NATO) and multiple years of pro Ukraine comments. \"yet have all this anti-Ukraine material on hand from various sources\" i'm linking primarily western media companies talking about topics that you keep bringing up? How about focusing on what the articles say instead of falling back on the tired old \"you're paid by the kremlin\" routine, it's a really really bad debate practice and it makes you look dumb :), like when Z-heads say pro Ukraine people are paid by the CIA. \n9. More playing with numbers to make narratives. soviet union took 70k in Afghanistan. Imperial Russia took 2x more casualties than Putin has during Brusilov alone. Which one to pick. Dumb argument path, disregarded. \n10. Calling the chechens pseudomilitary police is an interesting choice considering all the war crimes they've committed against Ukrainian civilians and soldiers. You're all over the place. No it wouldn't have been good for prighozin to have a battle on the streets of Rostov with another Russian military force, even if he had won the battle. \"Organized resistance\" WAS Wagner in that scenario, and Putin kept control of the army in a time where they could have easily turned against him like Prigo had. I agree that scenario was a showcase of how things could go south for Russia very quickly but it did almost nothing to the state in the long run. Wagner was dissolved and sent to belarus and prigozhin died. Where are the protests lamenting his death in Rostov? Blow it out your ass with the reading comp snark honestly, it's one mistake in a hastily typed 2000 word reddit response, \"champ\". The idea of ethnic minorities rebelling is pretty commonly floated around here.\n11. This exact same logic re: length of the front line applies to Ukraine in the same ways as it applies to Russia minus the fact that they have easier logistics. Longer lines are more prone to breakthrough and encirclement. Major cities make up key defensive lines, not natural features (unless there is a river or some of Ukraine's hill or swamp areas). They fight so hard for these cities like Toretsk or Avdiivka because those are linchpins holding together lines that sit in front of primarily empty space (terrain wise, there may still be trenches and stuff obviously). \n12. Mate, if Ukraine could perform operations all along the Russian border a la Kursk any time they wanted to, the war would have been over in 2023. Kursk took months of massing men and materiel from the Donbas and some new units. Ukraine used some of their best equipment too, stuff we hadn't seen in a while and extremely well prepared EW units. It's clearly turned into much more than just a raid considering it's 5 months in. If you're talking about SF raids along the borders, both sides do that constantly and the videos are just as gruesome if they're from Ukraine or Russia. Russia is throwing Norks at Ukrainians in Kursk because they don't give a shit about them and neither does Kim. The average Russian doesn't either. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmqFQJM4pTU\nIf the US wasn't withdrawing its support, I'd be agreeing with you in almost every regard as it relates to attrition. If that support goes, there is simply no way that you can convince me that Ukraine would be in a better position for a war of attrition than Russia unless Europe MASSIVELY increased their support. The best they can hope for is another blue white house in four years and a leader that isn't as incompetent and indecisive as Biden, plus a wave of defense spending and support from other Euro countries. The fact that we've dripfed them equipment in the grand scheme of things is a sham and it's the reason why we're having to have this argument in the first place. With that being said, let's not kid ourselves that Ukraine's survival wasn't even in the question at the start of this war. Surviving is winning in many cases, and for someone who loves to draw on so many historical examples, you should observe how many times countries won simply by taking the loss today and waiting for their opponent to be weak tomorrow. If Russia is a pariah state that is going to collapse regardless of the outcome of this war, let them eat the elephant and give those territories back when they lack governance over them in 15 years. At the end of the day I hope I'm wrong about all this and the Russian military collapses in 3 months.\n\n(Hopefully this one displayed better than the last one, STILL having to use old reddit. Pretty sure the links are getting my comments censored)",

This was not always the case, as the rather costly offensive actions in the battle for Avdiivka show, in late 2023. Russian forces have fluctuated between conducting mechanized assaults, dismounted infantry assaults, and those based on light utility vehicles or motorcycles. The latter started to emerge in fall 2023 and became a more prominent feature of Russian tactics by spring 2024. Tactical evolution and developments in infantry tactics leading to specialized assault units is hardly new. This pattern was observed in World War I and World War II. The development of German assault units was seen as a fairly positive and effective adaptation to the entrenchments that dominated the Western Front in World War I. The Soviet Army adapted various types of assault formations during World War II. While in the Russian case assault units made good use of expendable formations that could offset casualties, it also circumscribed Russian offensive potential such that even when Russian forces held the initiative across the entire front line with advantages in manpower, equipment, and artillery, the gains were incremental at best.\"\nhttps://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/10/assessing-russian-military-adaptation-in-2023?lang=en\nIt is both an evolution and a necessity. Let me ask you something, would you see a successful Russian assault on the front page of this subreddit if it took place? No, it'd be downvoted into obscurity like every Russian video is.

Just lots of Ukrainian vehicles getting hit resupplying/rotating troops from the front in kursk. \n\nMost of the articles point out that it could lead into a encirclement which is true, but that hasnt happened yet. https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-considers-kursk-withdrawal-amid-fears-of-encirclement-of-10-000-troops-telegraph-reports/\n\nEither way its a terrible situation for ukraine and i wonder if this is because US dropped intelligence support for Ukraine so they couldnt spot the armored assault that punched a hole in the Ukrainian defenses.  https://time.com/7265679/satellites-front-failing-hundreds-dead-fallout-trump-ukraine-aid-pause/\n\nif the troops in kursk gets encircled it would be pretty terrible since thats where the most elite ukrainian brigades are fighting, like the 47th brigade, 92th and 82brigade are all on the northern front as shown on uacontrolmap",

If a resource trade with Trump is what has to happen, then so be it.\u00a0\n\nOk, what are the guidelines for me when negotiating this deal?\n\n* This deal is with Donald Trump, not the United States.\n* Trump wants to \u201cmake deals\u201d and \u201clook like a winner\u201d.\u00a0\n* Trump wants to \u201clook strong\u201d and \u201clook like he\u2019s in control\u201d.\u00a0\n* Perception is the most important thing to Donald Trump.\u00a0\n* The deal needs to be made in person and announced shortly after to avoid too many people having a chance to talk to him between the deal being struck and him announcing it.\u00a0\n\nOk, what does that mean for my asks?\n\n* I\u2018ll agree to trade resources for continued US aid.\u00a0\n* I\u2018ll even agree to a bit more than I should in order to give Trump something to crow about.\u00a0\n* My ask is Ukrainian borders be secured back to the 1994 nuclear disarmament deal. That means no Russians within Ukraine\u2019s 1994 borders.\u00a0\n* My ask is also fortifications, including air defense, along those borders. This means armament contracts with the US.\u00a0\n* I\u2018m not actually Ukrainian so maybe there\u2019s other stuff in there, too.\u00a0\n* No resource extraction happens until the fighting ends.\u00a0\n* The negotiation happens in DC or maybe some big, extravagant European venue with Trump onsite. A media event will be scheduled for right after the deal closes to tell the world about Trump\u2019s great negotiation skills.\u00a0\n\nI know those goals won\u2019t be met for a while, so with continued aid I keep fighting the good fight. When the fighting actually does end, I \u201crenegotiate\u201d the deal to really be a \u201cresources for armament and defense maintenance\u201d or something. You know, something a normal person would take as a good deal since I\u2018ve done all the hard work (ie: spilled blood) to weaken Russia for everyone else\u2019s benefit.\u00a0",

They are their own culture, and say so themselves. They have never been integrated with the west.\n\nSure, they are nominally Christian, and speak an Indo-European language. That, however, is the extent of their similarity with the west.\n\nBefore WWII, Germany was very much part of the west. By the time when the western winning countries started denazifying Germany and remaking it into a democracy, the memory of being a western country among others was still fresh in the minds of the Germans who were being tasked with anything. There was no multigenerational loss of memory of living in a democratic western society.\n\nIn contrast, russia never had any democracy before 1989, and whatever democracy they had was snuffed out by Putin early on when he came to power. Most of those who are in power now have either grown up under communism. The russians who were born in 1979 got to live their formative years under an imperfect democracy, where people got to experience more disorder than freedom. Since the democratic interlude of russia only was a decade or so, there is only 10 year cohorts of russians who have lived their formative years under this imperfect democracy. They are too few now to form anywhere near a workable majority, and they are not getting any more in the short or medium term. Also, a significant part of those who otherwise could have been the basis for an orderly democratic society left russia early on during the current war.\n\nThe lack of democracy is relevant for Japan post-WWII also, granted. But in that case the nation-rebuilders were dealing with a people with a limited alcohol problem, and a a whole lot more industrious one at that.\n\nWhat it all boils down to is:\n\n * Identify reasonable goals\n\n * Do not attempt to do a fool\u00b4s errand\n\n * russia is big, and bellingerent\n\n * Make it so that russia is much less able to inflict damage on its surroundings.\n\n * Do not attempt to make russia less belligerent, or less able to inflict damage on its own russians.",

He said Russian assault units are attempting to break through and seize control of an important highway running from Yunakivka in Ukraine\u2019s Sumy Oblast to Ukrainian-held Sudzha. \n\n>In a Facebook post Artem Karyakin, a Ukrainian soldier, reported that Russia has transferred some of its best drone crews to the battle in Kursk. They are managing to hamper severely Ukraine\u2019s logistics and room for maneuver. \n\n>\u201cSince late 2024, Russia has dramatically escalated its use of FPV drones on various frequencies, fiber-optic connections, and fixed-wing types. Their primary aim is to disrupt our logistics,\u201d he said. \n\n>\u201cOur forces are struggling to deliver ammunition and provisions. Evacuating the wounded has become a dangerous and prolonged process. Some soldiers have had to rotate out on foot because transport cannot get through,\u201d he added. \n\n>Meanwhile, Russian ground forces along with allied North Korean troops have been advancing on three fronts trying to squeeze the pocket and to seize control of a strategic road to the Ukrainian oblast of Sumy.\n\n>According to DeepStateMap, a reputable interactive online map of the hostilities, Ukrainian-controlled territory has been significantly reduced and risks being shrunk to less than 100 square kilometers and its narrowest point amounting to just a dozen kilometers wide.\n\nOverview of the brigades defending Kursk https://www.uacontrolmap.com/map-viewer/",

We discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects. We both reflected on the Great History of our Nations, and the fact that we fought so successfully together in World War II, remembering, that Russia lost tens of millions of people, and we, likewise, lost so many! We each talked about the strengths of our respective Nations, and the great benefit that we will someday have in working together. But first, as we both agreed, we want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the War with Russia/Ukraine. President Putin even used my very strong Campaign motto of, \u201cCOMMON SENSE.\u201d We both believe very strongly in it. We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other\u2019s Nations. We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now. I have asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of the CIA John Ratcliffe, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, and Ambassador and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, to lead the negotiations which, I feel strongly, will be successful. Millions of people have died in a War that would not have happened if I were President, but it did happen, so it must end. No more lives should be lost! I want to thank President Putin for his time and effort with respect to this call, and for the release, yesterday, of Marc Fogel, a wonderful man that I personally greeted last night at the White House. I believe this effort will lead to a successful conclusion, hopefully soon!",

All of that combined DOES stop you being a democracy.\u00a0\n\n\nThe thin veneer of law and order is that - just for show. There are no real instruments of democracy anymore - the bits that were built in the late 90ies and early 2000 were left to exist just for show - to make it look like it's a normal country.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's not. It's not a failed democracy because it never was a democracy. It's a dictatorship.\u00a0\n\n\nThe murders of independent press and anyone who dared oppose those in power were never not a thing in Russia.

To compensate for this, they made a LOT of air defense assets, both short-range (SHORAD) and long/high-range (HIMAD). \n\nAs post-Soviet countries, after the collapse, both Russia and Ukraine inherited much of the same anti-air assets, and pretty much continued the same focus on air defence over aircraft.\n\nUkraine, being a smaller country, didn't have many aircraft to begin with. But they did get donated Starstreak missiles and similar tools to shoot down aircraft. Russia had more aircraft available, but they lost a lot of them in poorly planned assaults early in the war.\n\nSo in summary you have two countries with small air forces and a LOT of air defense assets, which means there are few opportunities for those air forces to operate. This is why you see things like helicopters being used to lob missiles at long distances, because it's the most that they can do if they don't want to fly into range of HIMAD or SHORAD.\n\nUkraine even shot down a helicopter with a Stugna anti-tank missile at one point.",

Hell, Putin pretty much told everyone in Munich conference in 2007 how he would operate. Now, to us, regular ducks, the invasion came as a surprise.

Yes, he's a completely incompetent politician, and a completely amoral bully who doesn't care about anyone else other than himself. Yes, he would gladly throw Ukraine under the bus if he could, and the only thing stopping him is that there's a substantial percentage of Republicans that still see Russia as baddies and support Ukraine.\n\n\nBut also he's a coward, and the past year's assassination attempt probably left some mental scars. I think that explains his recent rant on Iran:\u00a0\n\n\n\"WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he\u2019s given his advisers instructions to obliterate Iran if it assassinates him.\"\u00a0\n\n\nThis\u00a0https://apnews.com/article/trump-iran-assassination-88c9b1a0754165125d59d378bf4af477\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIt makes no sense whatsoever politically, as a.) everyone knows US would do that anyway and b.) him leaving any \"instructions\" is not binding in any way and makes no difference.\u00a0\n\n\nIMO, it just his fear speaking - he's a scared little bully haunted by his '24 assasination attempt and the way he ordered assasination of Qassem Soleiman in 2020. He's scared and insecure enough to put up such nonsense, even though there's very little chance Iran could actually pull it off - not now, not ever.\u00a0\n\n\nPutin knew this immediately and probably played to it. And Putin literally is the only person in the world that could actually whack Trump, even if that would mean the end of Russia. And Putin knows how to play enemy politicians - that's his core expertise, he's done many times, sometimes quite openly (\u00a0https://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/12/europe/putin-merkel-scared-dog/index.html ).\u00a0\n\n\nSo during recent talks, Putin's cronies maybe subtly insinuated that they could simply poison/shoot/nuke Trump (and they really can) and also that Putin's maybe going crazy and doesn't care about consequences. \"We have already talked him out of it but he's crazy, help us out\". And Trump shit his pants, on top of all other frustrations, and is now flailing aimlessly trying to throw Ukriane under the bus and being really frustrated that he can't.\u00a0\n\n\nThankfully, it's not over until Ukraine and Europe say it's not over.\u00a0",

Ukraine has already attacked here around christmas and moved a lot of heavy equipment across the tiny river in Kamianske (which may be dry now after the dam blew). If so, the goal would be to capture Vasylivka which is a major supply hub for Russia in Zaporizhzhia and then try to expand outwards from there. You can pretty easily hide hundreds of vehicles in Zaporizhzhia city like how Ukraine did in Sumy. And its the area along with Kherson where Russia has the least units and the ones that are there are generally there for training or recently moved from Donetsk for refitting.\n\nWhy Kursk worked so well was that there literally werent any forces there past the border. Ukraine didnt even need to fight for Sudzha itself and the nearby villages, so if a surprise attack were to work Ukraine would need to capture Vasylivka in the first few hours which is sort of fantasy land. Maybe Russia will at some point be so desperate for manpower they severely neglect a part of the front so theres only Ivan with his AKM guarding the town when Ukraine rolls up. Again, very very unrealistic, but it did happen in Kursk\n\nThe entier frontline, even Luhansk, is extremely fortified now. Russia never stopped putting up defensive lines and has literally dragons teeth in Crimea, so Ukraine would need to strike somewhere theres relatively low concentration of Russian forces. It worked wonders in Kursk since the random conscripts never expected it and the \"actual\" units behind just left their positions. I think that happening in Ukraine is impossible as of now, so I dont expect Ukraine would try anything like it.\n\nCould argue an incursion in Bryansk may work. Russian channels have been writing about a build-up there actually, but I think theyre just panicing.",

But perhaps we can get an insight into the President\u2019s thinking from some of his extraordinary ideas for peace in Gaza.\n\n>And after all, it might not seem as odd to to end the Ukraine war with plans for a holiday resort. Crimea was already a popular recreational destination, and Russians might well prefer to visit it as holidaymakers travelling to Ukraine than as invading occupiers, and pay reparations in the form of tourist taxes. Trump might also clear the shattered Donbass of Russians and their fortified defensive lines and rebuild it with US and European money, gaining Putin\u2019s consent by lifting sanctions. As far-fetched as this may seem, Trump and Western money might well talk louder in Ukraine and Russia than they ever could in Gaza, Amman and Cairo.\n\n>Trump-style outlandish plans, then, may get a better hearing in Moscow than they do in the Middle East. Certainly, Putin\u2019s oligarchs appear keen to get back to their superyachts and ski chalets in Europe. With the Russian economy in free fall, and even the Russian \u2018peasants\u2019 \u2013 who Putin and the oligarchy so readily ignore \u2013 perhaps beginning to turn mutinous, Trump may well have some aces in his hand.\n\n>What is clear is that any talk of the status quo will not be popular with Zelensky and any talk of the status quo ante \u2013 2022 or 2014 \u2013 is unlikely to get much traction with Putin. But as Trump\u2019s staff rein in some of his ideas for the US to take over Gaza and export the residents to Egypt and Jordan, it does seem that his brand of bonkers suggestions may not seem so ridiculous in Kyiv and may be impossible to ignore in Moscow.\n\n>Put simply, Putin must now be terrified. The Trump hurricane has the potential to blow him to the Urals and beyond. Buoyed by \u2018his\u2019 ceasefire in Gaza, Trump is unlikely to suggest a deal in Ukraine that is not going to stick. The only way it will stick is if Ukraine gets some, if not all, of the territory it has lost back. **Putin may have to trade thousands of square kilometres of land in Ukraine to recover the few hundred he has lost for the Russian people in the hallowed Kursk region, to allow him to save face and his future in the Kremlin.**\n\n>It seems that Putin is personally keen to survive the impending ceasefire. After Trump\u2019s bumptious declarations on Gaza, it is highly likely that Trump has Putin\u2019s essentials in his vice rather than the other way round. Trump knows he is much more likely to achieve an effective and lasting peace in Ukraine than he is in Gaza. Considering the new president\u2019s desire to be seen as the great leader and peacemaker of the 21st Century, Putin must be worried.\n\n>The new president is also very keen to hand this problem over entirely to European leaders as soon as possible, who may well also be worried. Nonetheless it is time for them to lead on the defence of Europe, as Trump becomes less and less interested in problems outside mainland America.",

I think the main core two problems with US are\u00a0\n\n\n1) Their broken two-party political system that makes it impossible for third parties/independents to do anything. Since the party primaries are entirely managed by the party in a largely non-democratic way (e.g. you have to be a party member to vote, which costs $ and puts off average voters), resulting in selection of most extreme candidates, which then the rest of moderates vote for in actual elections because it's the only choice.\u00a0\n\n\n2.) their money driven media environment and scrapping of https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_doctrine which naturally leads into polarization\n\n\nEach one of these alone is bad, but both combined means there's more uneducated extreme and they get boosted by the flawed democratic process. It's not that this isn't happening elsewhere (AfD in Germany just got 20%) but if you changed the voting process and media laws in Germany, you'd get the same effect (AfD would be in power). Which is why Trump and Vance and Elon feel threatened by Germany enough to try to meddle.\u00a0\n\n\nWhich, funny (not funny) enough, is the main reason Putin meddled in Ukraine in the first place and then invaded when meddling didn't work. He just can't have even a chance of a real prosperous democracy just across the borders, with people who are culturally very close to Russians - it'd be the end of his \"spin democracy\" project. Now he just can't have Ukraine survive politically at all in any form, so to be honest I think this war isn't ending until he's gone, because Ukrainians themselves aren't going to give up.\u00a0",
