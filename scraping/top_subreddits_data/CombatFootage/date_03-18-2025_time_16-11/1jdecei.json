            "body": "**Attached story to the post:**\n\nA Few Untold Stories with Video Footage from Patriot\n\nWe received an order to set up an ambush for enemy bombers. Yes, this is about last year when we were searching for any means to stop the glide bombs.\n\nOur team moved out to the positions, quickly deployed, spread out, and started waiting. Honestly, it was nerve-wracking to operate so close to the frontline without cover, but we had no choice. After about 10 minutes of the AN/MPQ-65 radar working, a \u201cFlanker-E\u201d mark appeared on the operators\u2019 monitors.\n\nBut we weren\u2019t born yesterday\u2014we knew they never fly alone. Soon, two more marks appeared, followed by two more trailing 50-60 km behind.\n\nWe had positioned ourselves so well that this bastard was flying straight at us head-on. We didn\u2019t \u201clight up\u201d for long \u2014 we knew it would bail \u2014 so we activated and immediately \u201cengaged.\u201d First one went, second one went\u2026\n\nNo time for full procedures\u2014the escort was carrying Kh-31s, so we had to get the hell out of there immediately. The M902/903 are valuable pieces of equipment, and no one wanted to take a Kh-31 or possibly even an Iskander head-on.\n\nThe MIM-104 was already heading towards its target when the command \u201cget moving\u201d came through the radio. From behind the bomber, a trailing jet suddenly popped up \u2014 guess what kind of payload it had?\n\nThe \u201cFlanker,\u201d realizing what was happening, immediately dove down \u2014 a classic move to try and fool the missile\u2019s active radar seeker and escape at low altitude. But that was exactly the target we were after. The missile caught up to it, and both disappeared.\n\nMeanwhile, we were scrambling, running around the position like madmen. And, as you\u2019ve probably guessed, there was a happy ending. We got out just in time, but the whole way, we had \u201ca wing\u201d (drone) on our tail waiting for us to stop. We saw it circling. Thankfully, our cover was waiting for us in our sector, and that \u201cwing\u201d also went down.\n\nBut in our line of work, it\u2019s hard to prove results. We don\u2019t put unnecessary holes in our uniforms, but our systems don\u2019t lie \u2014 and our Operational Command is top-notch. \ud83d\ude0e",
