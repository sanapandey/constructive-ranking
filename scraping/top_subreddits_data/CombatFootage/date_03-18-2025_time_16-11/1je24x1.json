The MiG-15 ejection seat doesn't have an automatic parachute deployment, the pilot has to manually pull it after being ejected out of the aircraft. So I think what looks like the parachute failing to open is actually the pilots arms and legs flailing in the wind. \n\nA lot of Korean war era pilots died that way, they would eject and either lose consciousness due to G force or flailing would prevent them from reaching the cord and they'd be unable to deploy their parachute before it was too late.",

The lack of restraints or a slower burning rocket meant that pilots often lost consciousness or broke/lost limbs upon ejection. And there was no automatic parachute deployment or drogue chute to stabilize them, meaning the pilots had to manually pull the chute cord themselves, while spinning, and while possibly (likely) unconscious or injured. In a lot of cases the ejection seat was no safer than riding the plane into the ground.",
