I did find these two soldiers from that unit killed in Baghdad, both from IEDs (which often included EFPs), in two separate incidents 3 years apart:\n\n**Army Spc. Isaac Campoy, 21, of Douglas, Arizona.**\n\nCampoy was fatally injured when his tank was hit with an improvised explosive device in Baqubah, Iraq. Campoy was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 67th Armor Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, Fort Hood, Texas. Died on October 28, 2003.\n\n**Army Cpl. Robbie G. Light, 21, of Kingsport, Tennessee.**\n\nLight died of injuries sustained in Baghdad, Iraq, when an improvised explosive device detonated near his M1A2 Abrams tank during combat operations. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 67th Armored Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, Fort Hood, Texas. Died on May 1, 2006.\n\n  \nSource:\n\n[https://www.fallenheroesmemorial.com/oif/rank.php?branch=Army2](https://www.fallenheroesmemorial.com/oif/rank.php?branch=Army2)",

The Tank commander was as well, Sgt/SSG Michael Paul Barerra.\n\nCpl Light seems to have died from a very large IED, I have the incident report pulled up and it indicates a very, very large one. I have an idea on possible footage of this hit, but cannot confirm as of now. I am currently waiting on a response from someone that I knew served in 1-67AR at that time to confirm if they recall.\n\nEdit: Source probably does not wish to speak of it, going off prior conversations he referenced \u201cscraping his driver out of the periscopes.\u201d (Statement previously approved for public distribution by him) \n\nIt would be safe to assume this was Cpl Light.\n\nEdit No 2: Source gave more without me asking (to be clear), 4 155mm Artillery Shells buried in the culvert. He was killed instantly.",

It killed a people in Abrams.\n\nThe issue with drones is that they  can aim the RPG warhead directly where there is little armor. Tank armor is statistically based, the front can be penetrated by an RPG if it hits the right spot because armor cannot cover the entire front.\n\nany hit to the side, read or top is extremely likely to penetrate and even though it might not cause devastating damage, nobody sitting on a carrousel of ammo would stay put. \n\nPlus, if you just got penetrated by a tank, ATGM or drone, there most likely another hit coming to your vehicle, so you wouldn't  want to stay inside.\n\nCrews don't necessarily realize they have been hit by an RPG if it doesn't penetrate and they are buttoned up. The tank has it's own positive pressure.",

Never inside a tank tho. I was eventually retired from that deployment. The 2 mild ones feel like a car accident but lot louder, def gonna pop your ears, and smoke/sand everywhere. Once you verify everyone is okay, and there\u2019s no ambush, we just laughed it off & called in support. Damaged the equipment but no concussion(at least no big concussion) no broken bones, everyone was fine. V-shaped hulls are amazing sometimes. \n\nThe big ones feel like you died. I woke up from 1 ied then had to fight off an ambush, that scene from saving private ryan, when they hit the beach & tom hanks just hears the ringing & vibrating vision, color distortion, slomo blur, is spot on. It\u2019s all black & slowly fades in as your senses stabilize, your brain is completely clueless, it\u2019s almost like starting from scratch & rebuilding everything in a few seconds like a computer reboot lol, then you start to hear the yelling/screaming, gun fire, explosions, PKM rounds whizzing by, then you have that fight/flight/freeze response \u201coh fuck, hand, hand, foot, foot, gun, mag check, any holes? No? alright let\u2019s do this\u201d and you literally fake it til you make it & hope the training pays off cuz you have no clue what you\u2019re doing for a few moments.. or for some they just go fetal & curl behind cover. No one really knows how they\u2019ll respond in that situation. I\u2019ve seen some of the biggest baddest loud mouth fuckers deadlifting 500+ completely lock up & that quiet dude that played world of Warcraft & weighed 140lbs wet, turn into an absolute stud on the battlefield. You just never know.. 30 seconds feels like an hour. Time slows down while your brain is processing everything. The most INSANE part about this, most of us craved that feeling like a drug after you experience it. Not the amnesia and concussion part but the combat life/death is balancing on a piece of floss, and she ain\u2019t light. It\u2019s a high like no other. But, I lost my good friend that day from the EFP that followed the IED. I was knocked out for a minute or maybe less, I came to before the medic saw me because we had immediate casualties. The concussion from over pressure and slamming my head off the walls/windows inside the vehicle def took its toll tho. Once adrenaline wore off I was puking & could barely walk. Some other units & intel later tracked them to a nearby town, we rolled in with 3 tanks, 5 Bradley's, 8 humvees, our 3 gun trucks, me and my driver with our rifles and 2 apaches. Those Calvary boys are no joke. Needless to say, they wouldn\u2019t be a problem anymore.\n\nThe final one, the big one, I woke up in the fob hospital tent waiting for a medevac. They put me back out & I woke up again in an actual hospital lol I barely remember that, I think I only remember it because someone told me about it & i convinced myself I do, it\u2019s hard to describe. It\u2019s like remembering a dream and not sure if it actually happened or if it was a dream memory... some of the guys I was out there with told me I was in & out, responding during extraction & all that but I don\u2019t remember it at all. Don\u2019t remember anything from days leading up to the event, don\u2019t remember the drive, the mission, nothing. Only what I\u2019ve been told. TBI, 14 broken bones, deep tissue/tendon/nerve damage, internal bleeding, got the whole menu. All my limbs still attached so it coulda been worse. Would have went back if they let me, I tried to fake it & say I was fine lol. Couldn\u2019t pass the cognitive tests though.",

TBI was still fairly new back then & it was almost \u201c4 hands 4 feet, you\u2019re fine dude!\u201d But the mental shit is no joke man. When it flares up it\u2019s hard to function. Headaches never go away. Sudden Loud noises & flashes of light fuck me up. Not in a PTSD now I\u2019m hearing helicopters flying over head or anything lol, I never really had any PTSD episodes after I was recalibrated to civilian life tbh, it just rattles my brain & I can\u2019t function. Good thing is when I finally did get it, I also got 10 years of back pay.",

The tank fills with dirt and smoke in an instant, the pressure on your body from the air is intense, but just after that it all gets sucked out when the pressure normalizes again.\n\nYou regain your senses in what feels like hours but only takes a few seconds, your sight comes back first then your hearing and you can breathe again.\n\n  \nApparently it sucks, but one veteran I spoke to sought out that feeling after a point, he loved it, it was exhilarating.",
