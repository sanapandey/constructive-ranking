So instead of getting those random bracers nobody wants 3 weeks in a row, you can keep it, 'surrender' it the next week, and up the drop rate on everything else that boss drops.  Doesn't outright bypass the rng, but makes it feel a little more forgiving and makes those low-drop-rate items a little more accessible while sparing you the wasted effort of getting an item you already know you won't use.",
