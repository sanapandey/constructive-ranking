I find 1 to 30 is super smooth and fun experience. 30 to 40 feels more grindy, but with mount on the horizon, you still have good motivation.\n\nBut after 40, it gets really slow and feels more like work than fun. Thats where I often quit, arround 41 to 42.",

Players are allowed to experiment with their builds, not locked into a boring meta rotation. \n\nI have a soft spot for vanilla, but I'm past playing it.",

And every time I regret not sitting it out and just continue.\n\nI blame others for it. I blame the tryhard min/max'ers, the phase preppers, the bots, the no-lifers, GDKP, the gold-buyers, the parsers, the bug-abusers, the guildies that form a clique and play 12h a day. I hate it when I ding 60 and I see someone full BiS next to me, it's demotivating.\n\nBut it's not everyone else but it's... **me**.\n\nIt's the hype, the FOMO, the Everest at a certain point. Having to work quite some hours to achieve something, when it's not even that meaningful. I wish I could turn off the switch and just enjoy the game at my own pace. And I need to stop comparing the community with Vanilla or original TBC. Everything was new and we will not get that feeling anymore. Everything is datamined before it even gets out. I'm not the student with tons of time anymore and that's a good thing. I cannot compete timewise with a large portion of the database and that's a good thing.\n\nOh well, maybe next time.

Invasions primarily give you the currency to upgrade that item, but also can drop pieces from a 3pc sanctified set. You can also just get the only 2 pieces of gear you need from that set for cheap off the AH. \n\nSo basically you hit 60, do dungeons for reals (they drop off bosses, which also conveniently drop the currency from invasions to upgrade the naxx item) until you have enough gear to do raids, then just kind of follow normal raid progression until you're interested in naxx, in which case you need to figure out where to get sanct gear from. 4 of 8 are covered from the 2 piece invasion set, and some drops from karazhan crypts.\n\nAlso a lot of guilds are blasting naxx and you can likely get in some pugs with less than 8 pieces anyways if you put some effort in. \n\nThe first week at 60 is basically just farming reals and trying to to get into mc/bwl/aq anyways, so you don't need to pay much attention to the other stuff.",

People forget classic or vanilla was incomplete. They added abilities from future expansions (because that's easier and faster than making up new ones, and thematically work) to complete classes, and that introduces power creep naturally. You could argue mobs should be tougher, but some of the classes that aren't warrior and mage and maybe rogue were really incomplete.\n\nRets for instance literally auto attacked, and judged. That's it. Hunters big damage dealer was.... ?? Did they have one? Lol arcane shot sucks, multi shot is ok, aimed shot is channeled, traps require walking up to target. They added chimera shot to empower serpent sting and had utility for viper and scorpid, and trap launcher runes to utilize traps.\n\nBut it's not their fault the classes weren't complete. It's nobody's fault. They didn't know the game was going to blow up to be this phenomenon, and become what it is today. It's just today where we analyze everything and min max like crazy, it's very easy to look at vanilla wow and say yes that's a great game. It's incomplete, but it's a fantastic game for the time. \n\nSod isn't supposed to feel like old classic. They are staying in azeroth and utilizing models and art from future expacs (also utilizing a sword from TBC sunwell that isn't even available in retail yet) and using the world and what a lot of people liked about vanilla classic but the gameplay isn't supposed to be the same.\n\nAt the same time we know it's a beta, and it's a bit wild West, and I'm sure they'll tone it back in the future but it's a great time to be part of the testing.",

So i cant agree with your point of view saying items in Classic are hard to earn. Classic is just slower overall, but its not even close to be as hard as retail skillwise when you play the top endgame in pve and pvp. And i only play classic nowadays. \n\nIts time to stop comparing these 2 versions since its not comparable at all. Both have their charms and attract different kind of players and that is fine.",

Unfortunately classic wow is not set up this way for many classes, especially warriors, there's only a handful of actual upgrades in the current raid tier for you and if they want to parse, they're going to the MT first so they can hold threat.  The only non-raid upgrades (sans dungeons) are time-gated to an almost unreachable level for most.  It isn't uncommon for some people to go an entire raid tier without a single piece of raid loot, especially during this shortened cycle, and thats a really tough pill to swallow for people who raid every week.",

I agree regarding the loot bottleneck, it's painful, but at least honor gear is easier to come by this time around.\n\nOne of the reasons why I love TBC so much, it's still has that  classic feeling in raids, but the gearing is so much smoother for everyone. I feel the magic was lost in Wotlk though when naxx dropped >50 items in just 25 man, let alone 10 man. Loot just kind of lost it's shine and scarcity, although taken too far for melee DPS in classic, is still an important part of the game.",

Half our warriors are orginaising their own runs and getting prio on loot over those who aren't, which leads to so many ony pugs going and that helps the entire community.\n\nThe reason I was a bit snarky was because a lot of people here confuse parsing with topping the dps meter, which isn't the same.
