    "selftext": "It's made dungeon grinding priests / raids so much more  interesting managing PoM and utilising rank 1 renews to trigger the bounce. You can blanket r1 renew the group and watch it constantly bounce back and forward, often to the tank (providing a lil dmg has been done the party).\n\nIt has opened up such an interesting healing rotation that has so much potential and is really fun and rewarding when you heals loads for such little mana!\nIt does take some skill to master, but it's so worth it.\n\nPlease never change this! Pull it into retail too!!",
