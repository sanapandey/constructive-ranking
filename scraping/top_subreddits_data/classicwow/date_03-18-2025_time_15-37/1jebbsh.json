What works and what doesn't work. Should we flood a new iteration with all retail spells or should we solely do new ideas/content?

If you want efficiency, just get to 25 thru questing, hit up the Duskwood incursions (dailies plus mob grinding only) until 38, then do the incursions plus mob grinding in Ashenvale, and cap it off with the level 50 incursions plus Blackrock dailies. I did no regular questing after 25 and focused solely on incursions and mob grinding within the incursion, but you can mix that up with regular questing and dungeons if you get bored.

I would also guess the marketing team who made the announcement is probably not the same team that designs and evelops SoD. You can't continually produce more content than the previously released phase/expansion. Sometimes there are side grades or downgrades. But in the grand scheme of things there is no more Classic wow content after Naxx, they had to create Phase 8 and its content. They are unlikely to be able to create brand new quest hubs, legendary questlines, new 8+ boss raid content every phase going forward after phase 8 (if there are any additional phases). They might be able to create a new dungeon, or maybe they create some new PvP events. Or maybe they take us into SoD TBC. Who knows until they announce it. The only thing we know is that Aggred has stated Phase 8 is not the end of SoD, what comes after phase 8 is still yet to be determined. Could they change their mind again and end it, sure its a possibility.",
