You may not like it, but most people are playing WoW for themselves first and, if they're going to be charitable, it's to their friends or guild; not some rando in LFG.   So please logically address the question I posed and then you'll understand why you're paying for tanks.  You're expecting tanks give up an hour+ of their time and energy for the minute chance a lottery ticket drops that they'll have a 20% chance of winning?  Who the hell is going to do that?  If you want to see altruistic tanks, roll a warrior or druid at the character screen and become one.",

I've never even seen someone suggest paying for a tank.
