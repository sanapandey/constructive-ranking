    "selftext": "Seriously. To a lot of people on this sub, this isn't some groundbreaking revelation.. But if there's anyone out there that is torn the same way I was, make the leap. This post is for THOSE people. Once you get to level 20, it's an entirely different game. I can't believe I was holding myself back from world pvp for this long. \n\nThe random skirmishes at every turn.. The player you come across that ends up getting the better of you, only for you to encounter them again later and take your revenge.. I've never had more fun leveling in WoW. Even the couple times I've been ganked by level 60's, I couldn't even be mad.. It just felt \"right\" in a weird way. \n\n  \nI rolled Dreamscythe initially and I was bored senseless with leveling.. I thought some PVP would spice it up.  I ran around STV questing for hours flagged, and not one player from the other faction would attack me. That's when it dawned on me and I realized I didn't want to be doomed to an end-game where my only options are raiding and battlegrounds. World PVP in this game is just \\*chefs kiss. Every time I log on now I'm chasing that high. At this rate it may be months until I hit 60 since I can't stop the sweet bloodlust. But at least I'll have a blast every step of the way. Rant over. \n\n",

Too many dungeon groups disbanded cause we couldn't even make it too the dungeon entrance. Hours of wasted time. It wouldn't be so bad if their was a negative impact for high level players pvp'ing lowbies. I think that's the real issue. It's sad, cause toxic pvp'ers don't realize they're killing their own server when they do this stuff. It's why all the servers before became so imbalanced.",

I only played on pvp servers for the last 10 years and used to love the random skirmishes, but that's when I had way more time and was younger. Sometimes those skirmishes and bouts would turn into endless retaliation from both sides and you never finish what you set out to do that night.\n\nOnly recently did I make the switch to pve and I love it. Like you said, so much wasted time and groups disbanding. I'm just not about that life anymore and adventuring is just much more smooth and therefore, FUN.",

I have leveled 4 toons (mage/rogue/warlock/priest) to 60 on nightslayer, and enjoy Wpvp while leveling, and typically seek it out. I imagine I get into PvP hijinks more than the average leveler. That being said, outside of STV, which is, you know, STV, most of the time someone ganks you they move on, or you gank them, and move on. I have a sneaking suspicion that a lot of people that say it is unplayable log in, get killed, rage, log off, hop on reddit. I have done this before myself, (if the first AV is particularly frustrating for example lol), but I am trying to get better about giving it a bit. The few times someone has been seriously griefing, I just layer hop, and problem is solved before I am back to my dead body. Even in a group, have someone leave, hop layers, invite everyone, presto change-o you solved your problem in just a few minutes. The only zone I have had genuine trouble leveling in is searing gorge, but unfortunately that is just the nature of the zone, just like how STV is. Of course, at the end of the day, wpvp isn\u2019t for everyone, and I can understand how it can be frustrating.",

Playing on a server dominated by your faction plays very differently to when your faction is being dominated. If you enjoying ganking lowbies then your opinion on being ganked as well will feel different to someone who doesn't gank at all. Same with people who play in a group mostly vs solo. \n\nI moved to PVE servers in general a long time ago and had very few positive memories from PVP like OP mentioned. Seeing the same people and having fights as you level up etc sounds great but in years I never experienced that. But I did experience huge amounts of corpse camping by max level characters/larger groups/etc. \n\nFor me, I am not interested in ganking lowbies, I like the idea of world pvp occasionally by similarly levelled characters but that almost never happened, and I experienced being ganked plenty by people I can't do anything against. The disadvantages simply outweigh the rare positives. \n\nBut others have different experiences where organic and roughly fair PVP happens spontaneously and regularly, and ganking is rare which seems alien to me in the same way me describing the regular gank fest might seem alien to you. \n\nI don't think the issue is being exagerated/overblown, I think the issue just varies a lot between people due to a variety of factors and luck.",

But the biggest difference in EU PVE servers is,  how people are way more chill at dungeons and how they play. There is significantly less emphasis on minmaxing. \n\nIt sounds silly but reality is the most mindless PvE minmaxers actually roll in PvP servers. \n\nThe chances of finding a guild or pug that really does not care much about your spec, world buffs or gear, is way higher in PvE servers.",

This is a thread about a PVEr who liked it and posted his thoughts.  PVErs spend way more time trying to convince people to not go to PVP servers than PVPers do trying to make PVErs show up.  In fact, in every PVP related thread, PVErs and PVPers both try to tell people \"If you don't think you'll like getting PVPed on, go to a PVE server.\"\n\nI do it all the time.  I don't want a PVP server full of people who don't want to be there.  \n\nBut if you think you might like it, give it a try.  It's not going to kill you.",

I\u2019ve almost always leveled on PvP servers throughout my time in WoW, and it\u2019s because of the excitement of running into random people to fight. But now that I\u2019m hitting level 60 and mostly raid logging, it gets frustrating when I just want to get somewhere and end up getting ganked without a good spec to fight back.\n\n\n\nAt endgame, you either have a PvP spec or a PvE spec, and for most classes, they don\u2019t really overlap. That\u2019s my main issue. There are players out in the world fully set up for PvP, while others are optimized for PvE, which creates a big imbalance. In SoD, I\u2019m playing a tank rogue, and they are terrible at PvP. I can set up my second spec for PvP, or I can set it up as a PvE DPS spec for when I need to swap, which is what I usually do. But unless I fully commit my second spec to PvP, my character just isn\u2019t great in those situations.\n\n\n\nLeveling on a PvP server is awesome, but endgame PvP servers can be frustrating because you don\u2019t always want to get pulled into fights, especially against people who are fully optimized for it. That\u2019s my only gripe. I still play on a PvP server and will continue to, but sometimes it just gets annoying.",

I have mainly played PVE realms for that reason. it's so much more enjoyable. If I want to PVP I can join a battleground where things are more balanced and everyone opts in.\n\nToggle on PVP has lead to some of my more memorable times in WoW. Having everyone on a the PVE realm be standing outside SM to get the hallows end boss and using the summoning stone. Seeing one person turn on PVP, and someone tries to gank them. Then it's all out war as both factions start turning on PVP. Was a lot of fun. \n\nThis is in stark contrast to trying to level in Hillsbrad and getting killed while killing mobs, going to turn in quests and tarren mill is now held by some alliance 60's. Screw that.",

Without necessarily needing to get any progress on my character in my play session. \n\nI sometimes just want to have some fun killing other players, or getting killed. \n\nGoing out to a farm in Hearthglen, where the ghost run back is about 7-12 minutes, and having to wrestle the area from an opposing faction player before you\u2019re allowed to farm there is just such a signature experience in this game. You die some, they die some, and one of you ends up being allowed to stay there and farm. \n\nAnd you know that once you or them die 2-3 times, there really is no point to continue making the ghost run. \n\nWhile on a PvE server it\u2019s just frustrating, as anyone you meet on a farm you want to do \u2014 you have to share and fight for tags through clicking faster. No wonder some people aren\u2019t able to make more than 30 gold per hour.",
