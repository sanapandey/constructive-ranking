            "body": "Sadly you only get two or three tanks at most in a 40man raid enviroment, and since it's the only core spec every guild needs to build on, tanks are pretty set in stone and it's much harder to find guilds as a tank player. Just for this reason I kept playing with the same guild even though I would have simply ditched them and look for another guild in more than 3 instances. I just accepted my fate and I know I won't be finding another guild as a tank, and I don't want to play dps, so I suck it up and keep playing with my guild. Only other option is creating a new guild from the ground up and it's too much commitment.",

Otherwise they\u2019ll yoink you and expect you to either be DPS or a bench warmer.\n\nYour choices are:\n\nfind a guild that recently lost a tank that has no one interested in the role.\n\nStart your own raids/ guild(say goodbye to your social life)\n\nJoin a guild and make buddy buddy with the officers and be their pocket dungeon tank which itself isn\u2019t a guarantee. There is an insane amount of narcissists in guild leadership roles, and if they or a friend wants to tank, they aren\u2019t losing that spot even if they are trash and you\u2019re an S-Tier tank.\n\nIt\u2019s still possible, I saw a pug raid looking for a tank for, I think ony? The other day on nightslayer, and if you are the sole warrior tanking dungeons and the guild leadership isn\u2019t hella corrupt, they\u2019ll make you Mt even if you\u2019re not super experienced.\n\n**Bight side is:** in TBC raids are 25 man instead of 40 so 1/12.5 is the tank ratio instead of 1/20. Also guilds split up into 2 raids which means 2 new tanks are needed.",
