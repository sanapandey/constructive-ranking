So like what about people who were on leave the previous week, or on leave the following Monday, or had tech/email issues (which is common for a variety of reasons)? \u00a0\n\nMost agencies told employees NOT to respond while they sorted it out and would provide further guidance (a common word in the government) on how to proceed. Our leadership eventually provided institution-wide guidance saying we needed to respond but to keep it very high-level and vague, since we\u2019re at a research institution which does a fair bit of confidential/secret work, even though the majority of our lab\u2019s stuff is unclassified. \u00a0\n\nAlso, in pretty baller move, NASA told their employees they did not need to individually respond and instead they sent an agency-wide response on behalf of all NASA employees. \u00a0",
