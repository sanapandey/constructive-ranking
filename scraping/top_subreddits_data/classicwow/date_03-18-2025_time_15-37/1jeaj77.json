This is really, really good for potential classic + fans (yeah yeah groan all you want this is a classic plus comment) because this is their next real step at entirely new, non-instanced content. A new, decidedly non-vanilla map is being added. That's, like, classic + speculation dreams since the idea of classic + began.\n\nStill. I really hope Blizzard takes their time and slows any future versions of the \"classic +\" game style down. Ultimately, SOD fans will play a slower and more vanilla-paced classic plus, but vanilla fans won't play a faster SOD paced classic plus.",
