Taxing someone like 1% of their asset value every year is very much doable and might also be a potential idea for other assets like shares in a company. However that is very different from the idea that most have when they talk about fairly taxing the rich, which would be closer to a 50%+ tax on unrealized gains. \n\nIt would simply not be possible to tell everyone to pay 50%+ taxes on any unrealized gains that they have, year after year. Everyone would just be forced to sell a huge junk of their assets all at once just to pay the taxes and that would lead to a huge crash every year. \n\nI support higher taxes for the rich and I hope we can find a sustainable way to do that but comparing property taxes with a high tax on unrealized gains just isn\u2019t a reasonable comparison.",

Which would totally crash the price on Lotus.\n\nAlthough, I don't really care if the price crashes, I think in a perfect world, the price is still reasonably expensive for a Massive dps increase for casters, a Massive HP pool increase for tanks, and a MASSIVE HP buffer for melee.\n\nBut at the end of the day, I don't really care, 400g for a flask is outrageous in its current state.
