Nope, instead of becoming healthier people they've only gotten worse as they've gotten older, with their own narratives about me, their own tactics to shame me, and both with a desire to control me for life.\n\nMy mother is especially obvious with her martyr complex, swearing off all relationships aside from her creepy enmeshed one with my older sister. You know how people make those insults about \"doin' your mom?\" I WANTED my mother to find somebody! I so badly wanted my family to really LIVE their lives (my father acts like he does, but it's very fake)!!\n\nWhere they are in their lives, they don't lack control like they think they do at all.

For example, everyone used the same song for the first dance at the reception. So, my MIL believed that she was entitled to plan a wedding and reception and pick what she wanted for my wedding with her son because she had no say in her own wedding and reception. My in-laws didn\u2019t offer to pay for our wedding either \u2014 but my MIL wanted to choose everything. We refused. Ultimately, they had a second wedding reception in their city for us after our honeymoon because my MIL had to have her own reception. It was worth it though because it was comically cringeworthy and included elements like an accordion player greeting us as we were introduced at our reception and a pina colada machine at a special bartending station.",

However, as many local programs aimed at helping the elderly continue to struggle with insolvency, many states may consider more aggressive enforcement of their filial responsibility laws.",

I think what you're saying is more that you'd like for someone to do that for you, ie someone to pay your rent. Of course you'd want that, but that doesn't really happen without strings attached. That's why people move out.\n\nGifts are not generally unlimited. If I give you some money, that doesn't mean you can have all of my money. Usually the gift of \"living at home\" has expectations and limits. The most common expectation is that the adult-child is saving for something (moving out, college, a down payment, startup funding etc etc etc), and the limits are hopefully time based and \"rules of the house\" based. ex: you can't have other people move in like you might be able to do in your own apartment/home.",

They have an internal desire to procreate, which is perfectly normal and expected. It\u2019s also perfectly normal to not want kids. \n\nBut it\u2019s not some selfless act to *decide* to have kids. Child rearing demands the parents become pretty selfless (not all do) but the decision is based solely on the parent\u2019s wants. The kid doesn\u2019t exist yet and doesn\u2019t ask to be born. \n\nI am happily child free but want to foster. I think it\u2019s important that some of us remain child free to accommodate the many children who have nowhere to go. Lots of shite parents out there, exhibit A^. \n\nThe way the kids barely react is telling. She does this often.",

My sister, cousin, and I were all first generation bachelors degree holders, who went on to grad school around the same time and got masters. My dad was really jealous of that, so what did he do? He enrolled in college, finished his bachelors, and is now working to finish his masters. He\u2019ll never say that this is the reason, but I know he\u2019s only doing it because he can\u2019t stand to be the least educated person in a room at family dinners.

If she\u2019s refusing help, she either needs to be committed, someone needs to assume power of attorney over her and make medical decisions for her, or she needs to be cut off and left to her own devices. I understand how hard it is for people to cut off violent and severely mentally ill family members like this. But at some point, you need to take care of yourself. Mental illness is an evil thing. No one deserves it but also, no one deserves to suffer because of your lack of caring for your own mental illness. If she doesn\u2019t want help for her mental health, then she shouldn\u2019t get help for anything. But that\u2019s also my jaded, \u201cfuck selfish people\u201d way of looking at things.

It's a lot to adapt to because having kids in your 20s has been part of the circle of life for centuries. But it's also not financially feasible for some people or, if it is, they're choosing not to give up their lifestyles. Which I think is the problem here.

I was in college, had a job, on the Dean's list, and all the things you'd \\[think\\] a parent would want for/from their kid. I was moving out because of the physical and mental abuse both parents dished out to me constantly. Everybody knew about it and gently encouraged me to leave. Even people at church. When she said, \"If you walk out that door, don't you ever come back again!\" I didn't hesitate to take that door handle and stride out on my own. Dad ran after me and took the keys to the car they gave me and said \"I still own that car and the insurance is in my name. It's not yours any more.\" I still walked away. Bought myself a car with the money I had been stashing away for months and continued to make it on my own. To this day, the relationship has always been on again, off again. But this time, the off again is going to stay indeterminately. I'm sick of the pity party and manipulation by a narcissist who has from since I was a little girl made it all too clear that she never wanted me and went through great pains to make it obvious my older brother was her darling. (She even sat me down in the middle of the living room at the age of 5 and told me she didn't love me or want me! I defecate you negatory.) And then she wonders why I never wanted children and have no children with my husband whom she barely knows for good reason and live on the other side of the world from her.\n\nThis woman's reaction is that of one who believes the world revolves around her and she is no longer in control of someone else's life.

He may have some mildly foolish boomer moments, but usually, they are typically sort of amusing or, at worst, slightly annoying. \n\nBoth parents were always accepting of everyone, regardless of race, sexual orientation, religion, or even politics. As long as someone didn't spew hate or cause harm to others, they were always respectful toward them.\n\nEven among my extended family, a majority of the boomers are the same. There are a few maga cultists among them, but proportionately, very few.\n\nEven all of the pre-boomer family I had were very kind to everyone and never exhibited any racism. I was fortunate to know one of my great grandmothers. She was born in Alabama in 1900 and HATED the racism. She was happy to move to a northern state after she got married. Of course, in the 1920s, the situation for POCs was still not good even in the north, but the difference was like night and day.",
