I\u2019d have to check to see the rating of those greens Trump putted on were but for example my local municipal courses have greens that are very easy to putt on, not many slopes or anything. Compared to my local country club where you need to be able to read greens or you aren\u2019t going to have a good time. So maybe you got a good stroke but without knowing what courses you\u2019ve putted on or watching you hit some putts I couldn\u2019t tell ya if you\u2019re better than him or not.

I think the challenge was that they are trying to break 50? as a scramble. so taking the best shot of each person. Now this mean that they have to birdie every par 3 and 4, and eagle every par 5.\n\nit looked like they were play red tees.. so woman's tees? in this video.. so like the furthest up. and given that bryson was going off with an iron and driving a par 4 240 yard hole, it seems they are not playing the tips (the pro tees) I think basically the idea is that they get to play SR. tee's because Donny boy is old. and thats the advantage. \n\nhonestly tho from this vid.

I *have* also seen documentaries and read first-hand accounts that depict life there as being far more normal than we imagine. \n\n> There are many concurring eyewitness accounts of the horrors that go on their, so pardon me if I don\u2019t believe a random Redditor over the evidence of my eyes.\n\nThere are also many *unsourced* second-hand eyewitness accounts and first-hand accounts from people with a very obvious incentive to lie (and often strong evidence to suggest they are lying, like in the case of Yeonmi Park). That's not to say that there aren't also first-hand accounts of legitimately bad things happening because it's extremely far from a perfect country, but I would be surprised if you weren't conflating those a little bit too freely because you seem to have labeled the country as being inherently bad in your mind.\n\nEither way, what I was referring to in my previous post was the random nonsense headlines about how the DPRK claimed to have discovered unicorns or whatever, which very blatantly come out as fabricated nonsense as soon as you do any digging whatsoever.\n\ne: dude deleted his account after looking through my posts and responding to something a month old. weird.",

I\u2019ve seen multiple clips of Trump push slicing over the years just like in this clip. Horrible technique and I doubt he would even take correction or feedback from anyone.

The player can choose to play the course as they find it, even if the pin is tilted or misplaced. If the pin is in when the stroke is taken, an opponent can't take the pin out, nor can anyone else if the pin removal will impact the shot in any way. Traditionally the pin is removed, but studies show that having the pin in the hole actually increases your chance of making the shot and reduces the distance the ball bounces if it doesn't stay in the hole.\n\n\nShorthand, no, they don't have to. The joke here is that there was no way the ball was going anywhere near the hole so it makes no difference one way or the other.",
