For purposes of this subsection, \"brandishing\" shall mean the waving, flourishing, displaying, or holding of an item in a manner that is threatening or would appear threatening to a reasonable person, with or without explicit verbal threat, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\n\n>Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-11-7\n\nFlourishing and/or displaying I was told can be along the lines of pulling your jacket open to reveal it.  Like the classic move in westerns when they tuck their duster behind them in preparation to draw.  If you're in an altercation and you intentionally reveal the weapon and it's a significant escalation, it can be argued a reasonable person would consider that a nonverbal threat of \"I'm armed and prepared to use it.\" (As explained to me, but that was years ago.)\n\nI got a conceal carry, but only to make it easier to get to the range and back.  I keep my pistol locked in a case when transporting it, but I figure better safe than sorry in case it breaks or whatnot and I have to get the gun home outside of it.\n\nJokes on me though. 6 months after I did, Alabama struck down that law and now any yahoo can conceal carry without a license or training.",

No cop is going to just let you open carry if they have to interact with you. They consider you simply having a weapon on you as a threat and will disarm you. If cops can treat you as a threat simply because you have a gun on you, then so can the public.\n\nNot to mention, there was no reason to bring a weapon to a peaceful protest.
