    "selftext": "So this just happened.   Minor boomer antics but still funny.\n\nI go to our CVS to pick up a prescription.   There\u2019s like 7 people in line .  One window open Whatever, they are always understaffed.\n\nThe guy before me is a 60 something boomer guy and the guy before him similar age but with a cane.   \n\nThe line is moving slowly,  one lady\u2019s stuff not ready, someone had a question , typical.  We\u2019ve moved up and now boomer cane guy is 2nd in line.     After a few minutes he turns away from the window, disgustedly mutters \u201cmorons\u201d loud enough for everyone to hear, and starts waddling for the door.     So now I\u2019m 3rd in line. \n\nHe\u2019s like halfway to the door with his back to the pharmacy when the person at the counter finishes.   Next person steps up.  Another clerk comes and opens the next window,  taking the guy in front of me (boomer cane guys original position) as a few moments later I get pulled up.   So boomer cane guy has just barely exited the pharmacy and they are already serving 2 customers behind where he was in line before he stormed off.  \n\nOh and on the way in when i parked i saw a huge king cab black Denali pickup parked diagonally up and across a big pile of leftover snowmelt and ice , with an old lady in the passenger seat.   Guess what was gone when i came out?   Don\u2019t even know jow he got up into that thing! \n",
