I was worried how much things echoed the 20's and when he was talking about the steep tariffs on China during his campaign, it was pretty widely agreed among a lot of economics people I read that it would devastate the economy and create a deep recession with stagflation. This is similar to what happened with tariffs in the lead up to The Great Depression, it's widely believed they exacerbated many issues and further led us down that path.\n\nCombine these steep widespread tariffs with the spending cuts, then if this bird flu gets to be a bigger issue you could have many people get sick or dying, and some more food shortages. Then combine that with the slashing of farm subsidies and the trade war with our neighbors and we could see a total collapse of our food supply. Then you have pandemic combined with light famine combined with economic downturn and potential for a crashing stock market, you've created the Great Depression 2.0.",
