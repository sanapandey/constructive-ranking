Not that they have to have a security detail for shorter or longer than 6 months. However, saying they\u2019re normal people now is not the best \u2018why\u2019 behind Trumps decision to remove their security. It\u2019s most likely he is acting vindictive towards his political rivals, like how he\u2019s now trying to claim that Biden\u2019s executive orders are null due to using a digital signature.",
