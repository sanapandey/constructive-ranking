It isn\u2019t a felony.\"\n\nWell, to begin with, you are oversimplifying this issue. It is far worse than jaywalking, even if it isn't a felony. You are not taking into account how this overwhelms our resources, starting with health insurance.\n\nSecondly, people here who have entered the country illegally are also breaking the law to survive by working under the table for unscrupulous employers. Some of these people are even committing overt crimes, like burglaries, armed robberies, murder for hire, etc.\n\nBeing that they are working under the table, they are not paying state nor federal income tax. Sorry, but paying retail tax doesn't cover it. Income taxes pay for the infrastructure like roads and the maintenance thereof, municipal services, fire departments, etc.\n\nAbout them working illegally under the table: if you subscribe to the weak argument that they are only taking the jobs that citizens don't want, you're naive. They are taking high skilled jobs that an employer would have to pay a compensatory wage for to a citizen.\n\nBut doesn't when they hire people working under the table. In most cases, they will do the job for pennies on the dollar. Let's talk about the education system for grades K-12. Many classrooms are overwhelmed with too many students of people who are here illegally.\n\nEven worse is when the kids are not in school. The issues are just exponential. There are just too many issues to name that destroy your argument in defense of people who have entered the country illegally, that I just don't have the time nor desire to do.",

                    "body": "Both the [Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy](https://itep.org/undocumented-immigrants-taxes-2024/) and [The Commonwealth Institute](https://thecommonwealthinstitute.org/tci_news/national-study-undocumented-immigrants-contribute-almost-700-million-in-virginia-taxes-a-year/), as well as [The American Immigration Council](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/topics/tax-contributions) are here to educate you. \n\nUndocumented immigrants actually contributed to the US economy via their income, property, and sales taxes to the tune of 89.8 billion dollars in the year 2023. I have actually helped file taxes for an undocumented immigrant several times, including just this past tax season. He definitely pays taxes.\n\nUndocumented immigrants are also eligible for *no* government benefits that are paid for by taxes. Here in NJ, our tax-supported healthcare program specifically states when you are attempting to register that only citizens and legal residents are eligable for any payment assistance. That's one example. You can learn a lot more about how these immigrants do not benefit from our taxes, too, in one of the three sources I provided.\n\nThe only way taxes go toward assisting the undocumented is via programs that are publicly accessible to all people, such as through tax-funded free vaccine clinics, education in public schools, or reduced-cost school lunch programs. Things that benefit underprivileged US citizens just as much, if not more, than they might benefit undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe IRS actually expects you to pay taxes even on money you recieved as the result of committing a crime. Did you know that? If you made $50,000 robbing a bank but didn't report that money as income and file taxes on it, you can be pursued by the IRS for criminal tax evasion on top of being charged with the robbery itself. These are known as ill-gotten gains, and they are 100% taxable under penalty of law. They imprisoned Al Capone for dodging the taxes he owed on his ill-gotten gains. They famously couldn't land a conviction for the crimes themselves because he was so hard to pin, but they got him when he didn't pay the taxes due on his illegally-acquired wealth.\n\nSo what makes you think that the immigrants who go to their jobs every day and work their asses off don't pay taxes? They live in fear of arrest and deportation and yet you assume they would blatantly break the law by not paying taxes? The same air-tight laws that saw to it that the notoriously-slippery Al Capone was finally sent to prison, and you think undocumented immigrants would just casually do the same thing en masse?\n\nDon't worry. You aren't paying for the housing, medical care, or resources of any undocumented immigrants through your taxes. In fact, if you recieve any form of tax-backed assistance, *they* are also paying for *you* just like we all are.",

They don\u2019t need drone cameras and multiple journalists on the tarmac to follow them off the stairs for photo ops. They don\u2019t need a whole line of personnel on either side of the walkway.

Therefore, due to the plea deal she took (Marijuana related charges, I don't remember the exact charges), which she served time in federal prison. Drug crimes and almost any crime in general are enough to get Permanent Residency revoked. \n\nShe had the opportunity to naturalize, but didn't, she had the opportunity to not commit the crimes, but she didn't. Now, she has to face the consequence of her actions and decisions.\n\nDo I think that the underlying reason she got deported was bullshit? Yeah of course, we've needed to federally decriminalize or legalize Marijuana. But you shouldn't play \"Fuck around and find out\" when it comes to jeopardizing your visa/ Permanent Residency.",

Now, I\u2019m not a lawyer, so this is what I found when asking why they were deported without seeing a judge.\u00a0\n\nEDIT: so after reading some more, it seems that Trump used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport them. It\u2019s an odd law to be using, apparently, because this is the 3rd time it\u2019s used and it\u2019s for deporting people in a time of war (the gang is invading us is the reasoning used).\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m assuming that these guys have a criminal record in Venezuela which would prohibit them from entering the US legally.\u00a0\n\nWhile I do believe that people deserve a trial and I definitely believe in the constitution, from what I\u2019ve read on PBS and NPR, they didn\u2019t mention their lack of seeing a judge, so that makes me believe that what they\u2019re doing is legal, but sus.\u00a0\n\nEDIT: a federal judge called bullshit on Trump using this Alien Enemies Act and issued an emergency order to stop using the Act to deport people this way.\nYou are correct about the trials, so thanks for the information.\u00a0\n\nWhat I found to be nuts is that Rubio said that we may outsource our US prisoners to El Salvador.

So they rebelled and pushed concepts like liberty, equality, freedom, while denying an entire gender and any non white group the same ideas\n\n\n\nAmerica committed a genocide the Nazis WISH they could have against Natives, they enslaved millions of people from Africa or descendants of, they stole over half of Mexico's territory in 1848. There are now less than 10 million Natives in the entire country(less than .03% of the lands they lived in for ten thousand years).\n\nThe US has fought against any progressive ideals to benefit the average person, it took commoners waging wars on corporations and government entities to get worker's rights that have been steadily stripped since Nixon. \n\nThe US has waged its Capitalist wars across the world, absolutely destroying Latin America's future, as they toppled one democratically elected government after another to replace with Fascist leaders. Of course you have Southeast Asia where the US killed millions, and hundreds still die yearly to UXOs.\n\nThe entire Middle East is objectively worse after the US destabilized it without any true determination to rebuild Iraq. Iraq is now a satellite of Iran. You all remember Afghanistan.\n\nThe US has always been an evil nation. From Day one. It just put a ton of effort to whitewash itself and promote American exceptionalism for decades, which is why Boomers refuse to acknowledge it.\n\nNow we are finally seeing the Empire start it's death process, as Capitalists are going to strip and rob the US as much as they can, while working with the Kremlin to install as many far right governments as they can worldwide.\n\nAnd then society will finally die to climate change in the decades to come. Nukes are a coin flip, but the NPT era is over, we are going to see a mad rush for nukes now.\n\nThe US has always been evil, and it has played its part to ensure we won't pass through the Great Filter and will add our part to the Fermi Paradox",

The US has hurt its own citizens and all the world's citizens with its actions. Now we get to watch as it and Russia, another hyper criminal state, install Fascists in as many countries as they can for the next decade, and then we get to deal with the beginning of the next phase of climate change, and the eternal coin flip of nukes, with many more nations joining that family in the next few decades.\n\nI don't think we will make it through the Great filter with the double whammy of guaranteed climate change effects and a possible nuclear war",

I'm not trying to use big words to impress you, that's just how adults speak. And yes, if someone is wet, it doesn't always mean it is raining. If someone is wet and comes inside from being outside shaking an umbrella commenting on how \"it's really coming down out there.\" Then you probably have enough evidence to draw a conclusion. Here, on this current post, we have a video of men being uncomfortably forced off a plane, paraded around, mistreated and mishandled by people cover8ng their faces but weird El salvadorian badges. My logical conclusions would be more: they are protecting their identity because there are definitely known cartel members being transported through there and the cartel is ruthless. This is how the El salvadorian gov has chosen to import people due to the dangerous nature of some of the people. All of that does not mean that I am alright with rounding up people in the streets and deporting them with little to no due process. I strongly disagree with that, in fact. But I'm not buying that this video is indicative of US tyranny without more information about this video. Like I said in other posts. Maybe I just am not looking for such an excuse to get incited. Idk why you gotta be rude to me though.",

It wouldn't matter whether you were a US citizen who hasn't committed a crime because they don't have to prove their claims.
