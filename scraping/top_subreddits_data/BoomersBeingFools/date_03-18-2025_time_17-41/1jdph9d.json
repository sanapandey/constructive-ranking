Now connect that with he is physically able to own and shoot a gun. That he does not \"need\" a gun license to be able to shoot a gun. And that he won't respect laws that curtail his action in any way. If he, or anyone else, is able to get their hands on a gun, then laws be damned, they can own that gun. Because they own it, as in possessing it. So he, or others, don't need to obey laws saying you need to get a gun permit, or wait 10 days, or whatever. All that matters to him is the raw, meatspace abilty to do a thing. Laws don't apply to him, he doesn't care.

Instead, like a retarded parrot, he will only spout off about 15 buzz words/phrases.
