Mostly intentionally, as apparently my RBF and headphones  are not enough to stop people from talking to me. \n\nLocal boomer sidles up right beside me, pushes some buttons, points RIGHT AT  the out of order sign, and asks \"Are they not working, since they say out of order?\" \n\nAll I could do was blankly stare back. These idiots voted. ",

            "body": "My favorite experience with this was I was working out at a gym (free weights) and at some point the power went out, it had been storming. The lights went out and the AC turned off. Me and the other 2 guys at the gym shrugged, and went back to lifting, there was enough light from the emergency lights. \n\nAbout 5 minutes after the power went out a Karen was pounding on the door like the cops. I went to the door and the electronic key fob thing was obviously not working, I opened the door for them and the first thing out of her mouth was 'Stupid thing is broken'. I laughed and walked away. She said something like \"Don't walk away from me, fix the door.\" I put my headphones in and walked away.\n\nShe petulantly walked to the cubbies for towels and bags , stomping around like a toddler. After that she fronted up on the treadmill like it owed her money. Slamming her hands against the controls, obviously not working because the power is out. She huffed loudly, expecting one of the guys to come over and help. We did not.\n\nShe loudly exclaimed \"is no one going to help me?!\". One of the guys said \"the power is out, what do you expect us to do about it?.\"\n\nShe looked around and noticed the lights, the emergency lights, and out the window that the whole block was without power. She turned to the cubbies, grabbed her stuff and stomped out.",
