The government does a lot of social welfare and public health stuff with tax money. \n\nThe wealthy don't want their money taken as taxes to fund research. They want their own private companies doing any research so they can make money from it. They view public health measures as a waste of money.\n\nSame is happening with our postal service. Trump thought he could win in 2020 by making mail-in and absentee voting nearly impossible. So he appointed a majority shareholder in the 2 largest private couriers as Head Postmaster around 2018. This guy got to work immediately by firing a lot of people from already understaffed facilities, banned overtime when needed to keep up with volume, and also destroyed a few million dollars worth of high speed mail sorting machines, slowing our postal service to crawl. Now when people complain the mail is slow, they can say it was a failed agency and we can go to the Postmaster's companies for parcel delivery for a higher price (assuming the companies deliver to your rural area. One of the reasons the Constitution states we need a government run delivery service that's nationwide with no extra cost is for delivery to remote areas).\n\nWhile Democrats are not the \"good guys,\" we're stuck choosing the lesser of 2 evils here. They were cozy with Israel, to the chagrin of most Americans. But Trump has clearly said, numerous times, that he's going to invade Gaza, relocate the Palestinians to SOMEWHERE?, and turn Gaza into a luxury resort with Trump brand hotels and golf courses. Imo that's just a wee bit worse than what the Democrats were doing.",

They\u2019ll take care of that when they open their mouth.  I want them to no longer be PROUD of showing the world they\u2019re an imbecile.\n\nRight-wingers operate by following clan-thinking, rallying behind a strong leader and finding each other through iconography.  This iconography is a badge of honor to them.\n\nI want to tarnish that badge as much as possible.\n\nOh, I know they\u2019ll find something else to rally around eventually.  Fine.  When that happens, we\u2019ll fuck that up for them too.",

And then, a few hundred pages later, they state that all sex crims against children should come with a non-negotiable death sentence.\n\nSo, yeah. this isn't tribalism.
