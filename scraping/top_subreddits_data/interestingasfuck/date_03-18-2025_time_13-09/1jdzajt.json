There, the bidding went up to $3.16 million, but it is unclear whether it met its reserve price.\n\nIn 1998, part of the necklace was found at a second-hand jewellery shop in London by Eric Nussbaum, a Cartier associate.The remaining large jewels were missing, including the Burmese rubies and the 18 to 73 carat diamonds that were mounted on a pendant. Cartier purchased the incomplete necklace and, after four years, restored it to resemble the original. They replaced the lost diamonds with cubic zirconia and synthetic diamonds, and mounted a replica of the original \"De Beers\" diamond.\n\nThe necklace is the subject of a documentary by Doc & Film International.\n\nA granddaughter of Bhupinder Singh of Patiala is now a jeweller in California. In 2012, she was involved in the exhibit \"Maharaja: The Splendor of India's Royal Courts\" at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco, where the recreated necklace was displayed.\n\nIn 2022, Cartier loaned the recreated necklace to YouTuber Emma Chamberlain. Chamberlain, who is a Cartier brand ambassador, received some online criticism for wearing the necklace at the Met Gala.",
