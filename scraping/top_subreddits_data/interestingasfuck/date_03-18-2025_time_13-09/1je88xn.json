            "body": ">In July 2012, an inspector from the QMSP (Qu\u00e9bec Maple Syrup Producers) was conducting an annual inspection of the maple syrup stored at the Saint-Louis-de-Blandford strategic reserve. As he climbed up a stack of barrels, one nearly fell over. Normally, the full barrels would weigh approximately 270 kg and be very difficult to move. The inspector opened some of the barrels and discovered that they were empty. In addition, it was later found that other barrels, which appeared full, were in fact filled with water. It was also reported that some barrels were dirty (despite the cleanliness of the Saint-Louis-de-Blandford reserve) and rusty (an unusual characteristic as maple syrup does not oxidize). The facility had no security cameras and there was no video evidence of the theft.\n\n>Officers from the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec (SQ), the provincial police force, initiated the investigation after the QMSP contacted the authorities. The SQ determined that the theft was an inside job. It was then established that from October 2011 to August 2012, a group of thieves were taking barrels of maple syrup and syphoning the syrup into their own barrels. The empty barrels were then filled with water before being returned to the strategic reserve.\n\n[Source](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/great-canadian-maple-syrup-heist)\n\n**Perpetrators**\n\n* **Richard Valli\u00e8res**, accused ringleader, sentenced in April 2017 to 8 years in prison plus a $9.4 million fine, with an extension to 14 years if the fine is not paid.\n* **Raymond Valli\u00e8res**, father of Richard, convicted of possession and was sentenced to 2 years in jail, followed by 3 years of probation.\n* **\u00c9tienne St-Pierre**, a New Brunswick-based syrup reseller, was sentenced to 2 years in jail, 3 years of probation and an $850,000+ fine.\n* **Avik Caron**, the insider whose spouse owned the QMSP warehouse, sentenced to five years in prison plus a $1.2 million fine.\n* **S\u00e9bastien Jutras**, a trucker involved in the transport of stolen syrup, served eight months in prison.",
