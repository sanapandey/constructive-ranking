The eruption had many global effects, especially widespread famines, but the creepy and miserable weather also caused Mary and Percy Shelley, Lord Byron, John William Polidori, and some friends to be stuck indoors smoking opium for most of their Swiss vacation that year. They read a book of German ghost stories and Lord Byron suggested a competition to write the scariest story. Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein and Byron wrote A Fragment, which later gave Polidori the idea to write The Vampyre\u2014one of the earliest Dracula-adjacent stories.\n\nEdit: Worth mentioning that Mary won the contest, I suppose. Particularly impressive considering that she was only 18 at the time and her husband and Lord Byron were already literary luminaries (Byron especially).",

Previous culprits of Rabaul in Papua New Guinea and Krakatau have also been discounted as we know know they erupted about a century later. \n\nChemically, the best match appear to be volcanoes in North America - either the Aleutian chain or volcanoes in the Northern Cordillera running through Yukon and British Columbia. There's also a possibility that the extensive volcanism around Mono Lake in Inyo County, California, might have contributed - and some of the craters there date to precisely that period.\n\nThe next colossal eruption in Iceland was Eldgj\u00e1 in around 939 which was also linked to cold weather and dark skies across Western Europe and as far as China.",

Horrible illnesses, asteroids, zombies - but no one cares for volcanic eruptions. But \"Outland\" by Dennis E. Taylor helped a bit filling this gap. A few students discover the possibility of creating portals to parallel earths, and decide to use that to get rich by digging for gold. at the same time, the yellowstone volcanoe erupts.\n\nThe problem with volcanoes, as I see it, as the culprits of mass extinction, is that non-super-volcanoes, if they erupt in our time, are not suited to endanger humanity, and super volcanoes don't offer that much lasting (easily written down) danger. you can always magic a zombie out of a broken down building, but once super volcanoes stop raining down lava bombs, it's pretty much how to cope with other hungry humans with a steadily declining tech base. \n\nGiven that volcanoes are more likely to hit us than asteroids or zombie plagues, that is probably convenient for us. \n\n\\*looks a bit scared towards napoli\\*",
