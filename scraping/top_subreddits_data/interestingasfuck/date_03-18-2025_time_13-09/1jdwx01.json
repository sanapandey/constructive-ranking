In another couple videos I worked it out and VOILA I could see the WHOLE STAGE at the same time.* To her credit, she did work it out eventually.

Bush era and enter the Obama era.  \n* COVID was basically unimaginable \n* PotUS 45+47 was basically unimaginable  \n* Smartphones didn't exist  \n* High-speed broadband was way more of a luxury than it is now.  \n* LGBTQ+ were WAY safer  \n* Nazis were still pretty universally considered evil  \n* Iron Man 1 came out - there was no \"MCU\" as we know it.  \n* Roe V Wade! **OMFG ROE V WADE!**\n* We still had Robin Williams  \n\nIt's a scary fucking place out there at times. And you have to teach your kids about things you never had to think about as a kid.  \n\nAnd the system fails them. Just like last week when my daughter had to go to a mandatory drug awareness session at college. She said they spent way too much time talking about what drugs there are (and there were names for these drugs the kids knew but the cops running the session had apparently never heard of) and absolutely no time talking about things that would be relevant to them at their current age such as how to protect your drink if you go to a club.  Edit: Okay, probably not a club at 16. But a party? Absolutely. \n\nI think the best advice I can offer is be consistent and be open. If you say something, mean it. Don't threaten something you know you can't follow through on. We've all seen the parent who tries to tell their kid to behave in public \"or else we'll go home\". I saw this at Disney World. NOBODY believed that shit, least of all the kid. Why not? Dad had spent hundreds, or possibly thousands of dollars on this trip. He was NEVER going to take the kid home.  Instead, say \"Or else when we get home....\" and fill in the blank with something you 100% will do. No exceptions.  \n\nAnd be open. Kids will still try to hide things they do wrong because it's baked into their DNA to try to please you. But if you're patient and open for them to approach, it goes a long way.",

But in curling you've gotta be even more precise.... while balancing on skates.... on ice.... while gliding at a running speed.....\n\nLike, it's incredibly infuriating to practice something when you're trying to do something precise and finicky and are aiming for control over a range of results measured in inches.

Like, I'd imagine curling doesn't require a lot of fitness other than a few specific areas. But the skill that goes into the actual performance is a lot more difficult to train imo. I can't imagine that even pro-soccer (football) players, when trying to get better, think the problem is they just can't kick the ball hard enough. It's the kicking the ball thousands of times and figuring out exactly how to kick it so that you put just the right spin on the ball to curve it through the air and towards it's target that starts separating the best from the really good. That's not something you necessarily need to be fit to learn. \n\nAgain, to make a croquet comparison. Most of the best croquet players in the world are either overweight or geriatric. But even having practiced the game for over 3 years now (and while I'm not in amazing shape, I'm definitely in better shape than a lot of top players), I still marvel at the magic they can get the balls to do.",

To give context, I was the slowest person to qualify for us short course nationals the year I qualified, so I didn't get to go but was decently fast. The main thing I had going for me was my open turns were very fast while maintaining similar power off the walls to Olympians. For most Olympians, the time it takes between touching the wall and their feet leaving the wall is usually 0.8-0.9s (might be different now but when I was competing these were the numbers). My average was 0.6s with my fastest clocked one at 0.51s. Over the course of a short course 100, that's on average three quarters of a second gained on the turns. All that just to say my swimming speed was quite slow for the level I was competing at. After a lot of trial and error, my coaches and I determined that it was fastest for me to push my pullout to 15m. Longer and I was losing too much momentum. Shorter and I had to swim more which was slow and I was not able to effectively carry my momentum into my stroke. Peaty is fantastic at carrying that momentum in his stroke, so he comes up earlier where his momentum is higher which he can actually maintain.",

What happens above water in breaststroke really doesn\u2019t matter if your form coming in and out of the water is standard. Kind of similar to how golf pros have really varied swings, but the swing portion just prior to hitting the ball and just after hitting is all identical.",

If allowed, all top level swimmers would just be doing underwaters the whole time.
