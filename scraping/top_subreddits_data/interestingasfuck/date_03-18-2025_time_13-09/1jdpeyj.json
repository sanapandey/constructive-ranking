Happy to discuss and add changes as people see fit. \n\n\nInsurance Standards for Police:\n\nEvery police officer must carry insurance for up to 2 million in liability. \n\nIf you do something that breaks the law. Your insurance pays out, not the taxpayer. Then your premiums go up. Depending on severity the premiums may price you out of being a cop. \n\nBody cam found turned off? $1,000 fine 10% Premium hike. \n\nBody cams not on where a charge becomes a felony? $5000 fine. 15% premium hike\n\nBody cam footage will be reviewed randomly by a 3rd party for each precinct. A precinct cannot go 3 years without being reviewed. If footage is missing for different reports. Entire precinct hike 2% on insurance premiums. \n\n3 raises in insurance because of one officer? \n\nHe\u2019ll be fired or priced out. \n\nIn charge of folks who act out? \n\nYour premium goes up as a % as well. Sergeants, Captains and Chiefs are responsible in percentages that effect them. \n\n3% / 2% / 1% respectively. \n\nRate hikes follow the same structure as far as the chain of command goes for their department. \n\nAny settlement over 2 million comes from the pension fund. No taxpayer money involved. Any and all payments outside of the insurance pool come from  police pension funds \n\nThese premiums and rates are documented at a national level so there\u2019s no restarting in the next city/county/state \n\nYour insurance record follows you. \n\nIt\u2019s not even that crazy. So many professions require insurance. \n\nYou\u2019d see a new police force in 6 months.\n\nIf police don\u2019t wanna pay individually have the unions pay via membership dues. \n\nWatch how fast cops get kicked out when the union foots the bill. \n\nThis may not be perfect but it\u2019s a start. Changes need to be made.",

Sure, the taxpayer still has to cover the cost but in the end getting the bad apples out will lower cost and have the same result (without the insurance premium)",

The fear of litigious patients and liability taint the entire system and erode both care and provider-patient relationships. Our OBGYN malpractice insurance is over $300,000 a year. You don't think that effects your costs? You don't think the fear of litigation effects what tests are run or what procedures are avoided?\n\nInsurance is not the answer for shitty cops. This just massively increases tax payer burden and makes policing more hostile. You can't have $100,000/year police insurance and still pay cops $70,000/year. Or hell, even $120,000/year. No one would be a cop, there'd be no money in it. And if you try to argue that \"only the bad cops would pay premiums that high\", malpractice insurance is ample proof that's not the case. MDs that have never filed a claim in their life are still often paying 6 figures if they're in high risk fields or areas.\n\nIf a cop smokes confiscated Fentanyl they shouldn't get an insurance hike, they should get fired and jailed. If they steal evidence, plant evidence, sexually abuse a suspect they shouldn't get insurance hikes, they should get fired and jailed. We don't need police insurance, we need a national database of every police officer so that infractions follow them and they cannot just be hired the next town over. We needed independent, 3rd party agencies run and staffed by non-law enforcement that investigates and punishes infractions. Like Internal Affairs, only not shit. We need to dismantle police unions. We need to massively cut police funding and redirect much of that money to social services, mental health response teams and state/local authorities like the health department, code enforcement etc.\n\nInsurance just makes a few men very wealthy and the whole system shit. Almost every insurance in life is a scam. The world doesn't need MORE insurance.",

If you want them to be sued due to their product being used in criminal activity though that wouldn\u2019t logically make any sense.

Like car manufacturers though, gun manufacturers are liable for product defects, and do face lawsuits when they put out products that do not operate in a safe manner. For example, Sig Sauer has had some trouble recently with a particular model of handgun potentially not being \u201cdrop safe.\u201d\n\nAdded note: It also sounds like a dangerous mindset to want a \u201cworkaround\u201d for any constitutionally-guaranteed right, no matter how you feel about it personally. That sets a truly dangerous precedent. Consider the implications of applying that mindset to other amendments. Consider applying even the same restrictions the second amendment already has placed on it. Should journalists have to have a special license or have to pay an extra tax to publish stories? Should people have to undergo a background check at their own expense any time they want to vote in a local, state, or national election? The fourth, fifth, and sixth amendments are on some thin ice as well these days, especially if you already have a prior conviction.

Insurance coverage is set by how much might need to be paid, insurance rates are set by the risk that the insurance company will have to pay out.\n\nRoofers rarely have insurance claims filed by or against them so their rates are low for that because the pool of roofers paying in rarely needs to be paid out.\n\nDoctor's (and cop's) are a much riskier pool to cover, and as such the rate in which you pay out as an insurance company will be much higher.\n\nYou do understand that's how insurance works right?",

That means that you need to pay the cops more, which comes out of our taxes.\n\nNot only that but the city/department currently amortizes those costs as the risk holder. Your solution would literally increase risk from an insurance company point of view, increasing the cost to tax payers with no discernable change in actual policy or responsibility.\n\nThat is unless your goal is to not have police at all by making them too expensive to have, in which case, please see my original post again, because you're selling this as a bait and switch solution to actual police reform to push another agenda.",

When I was younger I did some interviews for like CPS similar things (but more like a hospital or somebody is wanting the consult and to provide the person resources and help) and they were very upfront about how a lot of these things suck. Cause you show up and know there is probably abuse sometimes even the child says there is abuse but\u2026. It seems every state has a different level of criteria. That\u2019s part of the issue with anecdotes of somebody from say CA vs Texas. CA may take your kid cause a neighbor hates you and calls over any fight your teens and you have etc and they are more likely to take the kids to protect them while searching. Texas may require the CPS agent to directly see several offenses or crazy offense. To be clear I don\u2019t know exactly but I know in general blue states step in sooner to protect the kids and the red state protect the \u201cright\u201d to keep your kid.",

The decriminalization of drugs begins with policies, and this is sticking a toe in the waters to help people rather than just lock them up. And again, yes, it's grossly hypocritical bc he's a cop, but we have to start somewhere. Also, think about the precedence this sets for a lawsuit when they arrest someone and lock them up.

I also do not think any of them would benefit in any way from a higher stress job. The easiest place to start requires a societal shift away from demonizing welfare and handouts... I dunno though, I think back to two in particular people that I don't think knew at the time how bad shit really was. That they'd recognize to seek help even if it didn't have taboo bullshit attached. They recognized enough of what they were struggling with to lie to employers. Long winded way of saying I hope your brother finds health and peace to hold on to.",

To someone addicted to these drugs they don't care how low and destroyed they get, it's not teaching them. If it's someone you care about you just want to know where they are and that they're alive. They have to do their own work and for me it's honestly just about keeping him alive until he figures it out. Thank you for your kind words, I hope so too.",

Peeing. Actually, it covers a lot of sounds and provides a reason for you to be there in the first place. \n\nYou never know who is outside the door or who will walk in, so you generally want to have it look and sound like business as usual while you quickly take a rip. \n\nI did this stuff all the time back then. And addiction makes you do INSANE things. Doesn't matter if you're a surgeon, a cop, or just painting houses. When you're in active addiction, the only thing that truly terrifies you is being sober. You will risk anything and everything, and your old personality, your old morals, your decency, your love for others - literally all of that comes second to being high.\n\nI don't care who you are, hard drugs are stronger than you. Being high is, at least on the surface, better than having a job, money, a house, a family, or whatever else you think matters. Honestly, I didn't quit using drugs because I wanted to stop getting high. I quit because I literally couldn't afford to keep getting them. Withdrawal  was painful, terrifying, and all around torturous. Only after you're clean for a while can you start to rewire your brain to appreciate the truly important things again. But to this day, I maintain that if science creates affordable, side-effect-free opiates with no tolerance build-up, I will 1,000% be doing that nonstop.",

Police are responding to situations they're not trained for and shouldn't be responding to. Divert funding to other organizations such as CPS and drug treatment programs. Decriminalize drug use and treat it like the health endemic that it is. And as police will be responding to fewer calls, that's less opportunity for abuse. Power corrupts, as they say, and essentially police have too much power. Obviously they need to be held accountable when they do break the rules, and part of that means pulling funding from internal affairs and establishing external oversight. You don't want Boeing employees at the FAA investigating Boeing and you don't want police at internal affairs investigating police.\n\nOur society is very hung up on dollars and cents, so \"defund\" is the 1 word slogan.",

The cop you linked is Phillip Brailsford from Mesa Arizona, who committed murder. Did you even read your link before you posted it? You just googled something about a cop getting a pension and then linked it without reading anything, didn't you?\n\nThen you smugly ask me to acknowledge that I'm wrong. Will you show the name moral fiber you demanded of me and admit that YOU were wrong?",

We went out for a smoke break one day and she gave me an ultimatum, get clean or I have to fire you because too many people see what's going on. She said once I'm clean for a year I can move from packing product to material handling. I got help and did get clean and a year later she was true to her word and let me drive the forklift. 10 years later and 3 jobs, I now have a office job where I buy millions of dollars worth of raw materials and tooling for a manufacturing facility. All thanks to Bonnie giving me a chance I really didn't deserve. She died a year after I found a new job so I'll never get to thank her but I was at least able to tell her husband and son how much she meant to me.",

He\u2019s a probationary employee (who is already on thin ice because of failing to meet the conditions of his conditional employment), who committed a fireable offense on camera, and we expected he would resign before the investigation because it would give him a chance at a career in the future.

Many cities, counties etc don't have comprehensive rules regarding hiring. Having a criminal background may not exclude him, as well as if he got fired or quit of his own accord.   \nThis is where something like a state licensure would be of benefit...each cop has a license to act in the capacity. Acts such as this are reviewed at a state level, so regardless of the department's actions following the incident, they can pull that license. At that point he can no longer be a cop in whatever geographic area the licensure (national, state, county, etc).  \nThis is how several fields work. Medicine, behavioral health, etc. If you're a nurse and pick up a dui, you'll lose your nursing license, have to mandatory courses, etc. You can apply for reinstatement after the specified conditions and time period have passed, but until then, you don't have a license and it's illegal to practice. But there may be a means to get back into the field, assuming you are willing to address whatever the problem is.",

C\n\nIt's a weird exchange, because after that the cop says \"been chasing the dragon eh?\" which is slang term for smoking heroin off of foil, not meth. The cop doesn't question the suspects conflicting answer whatsoever so leads me to believe the cop is either totally uneducated and ignorant about drugs, or was just keeping quiet already because he had intentions with that fentanyl.\n\nAny cop who has been around drugs and any drug user can tell you, you don't smoke meth off of foil. People smoke heroin and fentanyl off foil though.\n\nThe point is, the cop 100% knew that was fentanyl and not crystal meth. Not that either one is better than the other, but I keep seeing this story titled \"cop smoked fentanyl on accident\" when after watching the whole video, it's pretty clear he knew it was fentanyl from the start.",

Something I want people to consider from a prosecutorial aspect:\n\n1. No one witnessed him in the **act** of consuming the drug. While you have the bodycam footage, you're unlikely to have any of his partners willingly testify against him.\n2. Unless the evidence was baggied, which it didn't look like it was in the video, it is hard to prosecute him for abuse of evidence. You cannot really prove that the drugs he consumed were the same ones at the scene, its mostly conjecture.\n3. Based on the two points above, odds are the most the cop would have gotten would be a class II misdemeanor. Assuming he is a first time offender, even if he was just your average joe he likely would have pled down to probation and community service.\n\nI know a lot of you will say \"but he can still go somewhere else and be a cop!\" Well, different agencies have different standards. I can guarantee you that the first thing any LE office will do before hiring you is just google you and see what pops up. The people that don't care now aren't going to care after you have a misdemeanor. The shitty cops always go to the shitty police departments.",

The most likely thing that happens is there's cross-contamination, like they weighed your weed on the same scale they use for fent. But most small-time weed dealers aren't also selling fentanyl. It's just fear mongering at this point.",

At first I though \"Well maybe he saw the pipe or something\", but in the bodycam they act like they assume it must have been accidental exposure and act surprised when they actually do find the pipe. IMO Sacramento PD needs to test everyone in the department to ensure public safety.",

The smell would stick to your body armor and uniform, and it must, it's highly reactive refined then burnt inorganics. Nobody wanted to bring this asshole to the hospital, and they did it anyway because it was the right thing to do. He was gonna die without NARCAN.\n\nAnd now, they're all mad at eachother over 'facts on paper', and whether he really needed an ambulance ride. or if it's fine to use meth and sport a government firearm. or if it's only ok, if you buy your drugs at the gas station, and sport a government firearm and handcuffs working 12-16 hour days.\n\nEdit: a police officer working narcotics, that takes narcotics is a victim of their professional hazards and should be treated very humanely. This is like a nurse that becomes addicted to her back pain medication given to her by her co-worker doctor. The Cop had knowledge and access to narcotics and they learned at work, and they suffered a medical condition called chemical dependence. If he had gone to a doctor about his medical condition, instead of stealing from evidence to 'get good,' he would not have been punished but helped.\n\nAs is he remains, he appears unpunished for the theft. Or, the reckless possession of a firearm and badge, while under the effects of intoxicating substances. He didn't even pay back any overtime he performed for the month, while smoking meth in the bathroom, in uniform.  \n\nI bet this cop is great at spotting meth users from a mile away, while twitching.",

In the state of California, you cannot own or possess a firearm if you\u2019ve attempted suicide or been hospitalized after making suicidal comments. This is an automatic disqualification for applying as a peace officer. I believe OP posted an updated comment about his POST certification being removed. But, ultimately, you cannot be a peace officer (at least in the state of California) once you\u2019ve gone the route this guy did.",

I was like \"dude whatever ever happened with your dad getting caught doing all that shit?\" He goes \"what are you talking about?\" I say, \"your dad got caught smuggling hard drugs into the prison he used to work at\" he refused to believe me.\n\nThen like 2 weeks later I saw him again and he says \"dude... I asked my mother and she told me it's all true\" I guess the parents decided to not tell him because they didn't want him thinking his dad was a scumbag dirty cop. Oops lol.",
