Easiest way to set this in your mind is to actually use a physical one, then when it's standard to you you can start imagining the abacus and just motioning to make the changes mentally. Like anything you would start small and work your way from easy (2 + 2) to medium (56+173) and so on. Obviously he is a bit beyond typical, but this is the general idea - after that it's mainly practice and challenging yourself until you can do more and more. \n\nThe real question is what level skill do you need to do this faster than using a calculator, or what specific situations it could be practically useful where a calc isn't.",

To have that level of very specific and accurate skill is pretty unusual for anyone, but is more common within the autistic community. \n\nFlapping hands, walking on tiptoes, rocking backwards and forwards, even banging the head on things are all forms of \"stimming\" (from simulation) which are also fairly common among autistic people. Often it's a self - soothing behaviour.\n\nThat's not to say that every autistic person is amazing at maths and flaps their hands a lot, but I'd say that there's a good chance that every person who you met who is freakishly good at maths and flaps their hands a lot, is autistic.\n\nI guess I kind of thought all that was fairly common knowledge and so when you asked \"why does he need to do that with his hands?\", I just thought \"probably just because it helps him relax and/or concentrate, why is that surprising?\"",
