Most biped dinos wouldn't even be able to touch their tails on the ground without crouching, since they have a much more horizontally aligned body, with stiff muscles that held it all together.

All spiders are venomous, most are harmless because they flee before they attack or don't/can't bite us. Some do bite every now and then but the venom is weak or the effect is not that bad. There is a select group of spiders that are dangerous to humans and almost all of them have either necrotic (cytotoxic) venom which liquifies the affected tissue and causes a spreading rot or neurotoxic venom which affects the nervous system. These types of venom are more common in the \"old world\" and venomous animals in general are more common in warmer climates. However more potent venom usually is more costly, so they don't waste it. When used for defence it's gotta be a life threatening situation and when used for offence it's gotta result in food.",
