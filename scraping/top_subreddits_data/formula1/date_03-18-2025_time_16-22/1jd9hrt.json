    "selftext": "Welcome to the Day after Debrief discussion thread!\n\nNow that the dust has settled in Melbourne, it's time to calmly discuss the events of the last race weekend. Hopefully, this will foster more detailed and thoughtful discussion than the immediate post-race thread now that people have had some time to digest and analyze the results.\n\nLow-effort comments, such as memes, jokes, and complaints about broadcasters will be deleted. We also discourage superficial comments that contain no analysis or reasoning in this thread (e.g., 'Great race from X!', 'Another terrible weekend for Y!').\n\nThanks",

            "body": "The most curious thing for me was how similar to the end of the past season everything was, in terms of performance. McLaren being the much faster car when the tires drop, Max being able to hang in there at the beginning until that point, Ferrari apparently compromising their setup, Mercedes being a sort of unremarkable good team... it seems like things only shook up a little at the back of the grid (mostly Haas...).\n\nObviously this is the first race and we should see teams making leaps as they adjust to new packages and all that, but it was weirdly underwhelming despite a very eventful race.",

The likes of Merc and Ferrari have tended to develop well under this formula. This time last year, you\u2019d have probably gotten quite short odds on Red Bull winning every race. McLaren look to be similarly dominant, but I\u2019m not as confident in them operationally nor in Lando or Oscar relative to Max. \n\nThere\u2019s definitely a status quo from the end of last year, but to me it raises as many questions as it does answers. I\u2019m excited by it, really.",

Kevin Magnussen is still the most recent rookie to score a podium on his debut (Australia 2014).",

Every weakness he had displayed in previous seasons was thrown at him and he overcame every single one. \n\n* Held P1 at the start\n* learned to shut the door on Max\n* managed conditions changing\n* made the right calls\n* pitted for inters (!!) \n* had a proper dialogue with his race engineer, asked questions and asked A LOT\n* managed restarts without losing positions\n* recovered from a mistake\n* managed pressure from behind\n\nI was impressed. \n\nThe speed of the McLaren is something else though, it was already decent in the rain but then the period of slick running was ominous. Norris pulled away from both Piastri and Verstappen on a drier track which suggests the gap would have been much bigger in a dry race.\n\nPiastri had a good race until he had to chase down Norris. At that point he pushed far too hard and the mistakes started to come. He put a tyre in the gravel and could have ended up in the same situation as Alonso. Being too eager to get back out in front of Max meant he took far too much speed back into the track and ended up in the grass. It was a bad day for him. \n\nMax will always be a menace even though he himself didn\u2019t have the best of races making rare mistakes in the rain. Sliding around on slicks after making the call to stay out and gamble was quite the move. He nearly ended up binning it in the pit lane. \n\nFerrari\u2026what can be said about Ferrari that hasn\u2019t already been said. The communication is dire and they seem incapable of learning from their mistakes. Rain strategy is a Ferrari weak point but this time they had Hamilton there for advice and they didn\u2019t want it. The car did not look good and the pace that had been seen on Friday never materialised. Shanghai is next and they weren\u2019t very good there either last year. Ferrari have problems and I don\u2019t think Lewis Hamilton will be able to fix it. \n\nShout out to Albon and Tsunoda, one of which had the perfect strategy and the other whose race was wrecked by bad strategy. Yuki did everything correctly this weekend but his team screwed him. \n\nAntonelli was also very impressive. Coming back from P16 to P4 in his first race although granted he was massively out of position for the car he had. But he did an excellent job at managing his race pace.",

MV wants to be 'friends' with him as much as possible, as shown post-race, but I don't think it's ever going to benefit LN. Thought the cooldown room was interesting, in that despite LN winning he still looked like he was literally and metaphorically looking up to MV.

After the death of Bianchi, there was a major swing too far in the other direction, and we've had years of knowing the moment there's a slight bit of rain it'll be red flagged until it's almost time for dry tires again, and it's been crap.\n\nYesterday seemed like a reversal of this trend, finally. Yes, it wasn't as wet as Spa 2021, but we actually saw wet weather racing, and the race wasn't red flagged multiple times like it would have been in previous years. When there was a crash, the safety car was released, the track cleared in a few laps, and off we went again. No red flag, no extended delays as they don't want a standing start during a 2 lap burst of rain, no arguments over \"he should be able to change tyres under a red flag\", just straight up traditional racing.\n\nPersonally I loved it, and hope race control keep up this trend. I'm just amazed at the sheer volume of comments in the race thread, and post race thread, about how unsafe everything was, how it should have been red flagged. We can't have it both ways, and I definitely prefer the more measured risk acceptance model of racing we saw yesterday.",

Maybe not dominantly so, but I expected them to be a contender\n\nAside from the strategical blunder that costed them, the tyres were overheating until it immensely slowed them down, their pace was nowhere towards the front pack and the setup was nowhere as amazing as expectations would have made it out to be. It was not just the race that compromised their chances, but it was simply not a great weekend overall on their end.

I really thought they would be able to continue their upwards trend from last season.\n* **Williams** on the other hand are actually on an upwards trend? Shame that Albon lost the P4 in the end, but that he even managed to hold onto that in the first place was amazing. Very nice start of the season for him and the team.\n* **Toro Rosso/Alpha Tauri** or whatever should just overhaul their whole strategy team. What a disgrace. And it has been a disgrace for quite a while now. It was the same last season as well, Yuki or Daniel in a good point scoring position? Nooooooo, watch us strategize them into the back of the field. HOW!?!?!? They are frustrating me even more than Ferrari and that is saying something.\n* **Alpine**, honestly not much to say. I feel a bit sorry for Doohan. Didn't really see much from Gasly. Really have no idea where they are in terms of pace.\n* **Aston Martin**, hats off to Stroll. Somehow in a wet race with so many people crashing, he manages to get into the points. The duality of Stroll. Beach yourself on the formation lap in Brazil, somehow survive this race. I just don't understand it lmao very happy for him though. Hopefully this is the start of a better season for him.\n* **Sauber** starting this season a lot better than last year. It seems like at the very least they are free from being the last place team in terms of their pace. Hulk rewarded their trust in him right away with some nice points on his Sauber debut. \n* **Ferrari**. Well Ferrari is doing Ferrari things. First of all I really expected more from them. Especially after Friday. It thought they'd have had the pace to take the fight to McLaren. Maybe they just went wrong in their setup. I hope that them having to raise their ride height isn't going to be a recurring problem this season... Also they really should've followed Max into the pits. \n* **Mercedes** had the driver that impressed me the most yesterday in Antonelli. Yes, he had his spin, yes George was P3 in front of him. Still for his very first race in F1, that was mighty impressive. I'm looking forward to seeing what more he can do in F1. It looks like Mercedes have a bright future with a very talented young driver. George an anonymous in P3 in the end, I don't mean that in a bad way btw. I just don't remember the tv direction showing him at all. He just drove a clean race in no mans land between the McLarens and Max on the one hand and the pack behind Alex behind him. \n* **Red Bull** really should've pitted Lawson a lap earlier. Why do you leave the inexperienced guy out on the mediums that long when McLarens have already skated off track? On the other hand they tried to gamble with Max. It didn't pay off, but it also didn't cost them. The right choice to make at the time. Max got mighty close to Lando in the end due to Lando making an error in turn 6. Like Max said, I don't think he could've gone for an overtake because there really was only one dry line. But it was fun to look at. \n* **McLaren** really are the class of the field. Although I really hope that Australia is an outlier in terms of pace for McLaren. If they are as far up the road in terms of pace and tyre management as it seems, we're in for 2023 part 2 Orange edition. They almost lost the win when both cars went off, but Lando managed to hold on. Oscar also did great to keep his head down and salvaged some points in the end. You never know how close it will be at the end of the season, so maybe those few points will come in clutch in the end.",

If the car is dominant and they have a big advantage to the top 2 teams, then even if Norris makes a mistake, the car advantage is large enough to recover whereas last year, whilst they had a very good car, there were 2/3 teams pretty close which meant his mistakes were punished more and more. \n\nOscar did score the most points within a period but that included Norris having a DNF in Austria and making multiple uncanny mistakes such as Spa and his race starts. \n\nOscar can\u2019t rely on those every time to beat Norris.

It wasn\u2019t just in F1, either.

Marshals seemed almost lackadaisical at times, standing around or moving slowly, like they weren\u2019t sure what they were supposed to be doing. I can only assume this is some sort of leadership issue since it was happening across the whole weekend. Maybe the people calling the shots didn\u2019t know what they were doing, or communication between areas wasn\u2019t great, or it was particularly difficult to manage getting recovery vehicles onto the circuit due to its layout. I have no idea, so I\u2019m just speculating. It would be great to hear some insight if anyone has any experience working Albert Park.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m appreciative as we all should be to the people who work up to and over the course of the weekend to make the GP happen, but it feels like at times slow decision making delayed us from being able to get back to racing as early as we should have, and that\u2019s never a good thing.",

One thing that really stood out was how some of them were \"waving\" flags, and with \"waving\" I mean moving it up and down rather than actually waving it. While it was probably due to how heavy a wet flag is, and how hard is to wave a wet flag, I noticed the same even when the track was dry. Also I rarely saw people waving two flags but rather having two people to wave one flag each, which is meh since you're removing one marshal from other duties (although in F1 you have so many marshals at each post that it probably did not matter)",

Everyone outside of Max, who's a generational talent in his prime, was getting dropped by over a second a lap. If the race had stayed green till the end without any SC, then Max and Russell and maybe Leclerc would've been the only drivers who had finished the race without getting lapped.\n\nPlus Lando's fastest lap was a clean 8 tenths better than anyone else.\n\nIf this gap isn't track dependent and other teams don't catch up, McLaren could win a good 20 races this year, perhaps more. It's probably going to be like 2020, but with McLaren in place of Merc. With Max picking up 3-4 wins but nowhere close as far as WDC is concerned.\n\nWith the 2026 rule changes incoming as well, I can see teams binning 2025 early if the start doesn't go well and focus on 2026, thus reducing the chances of McLaren getting caught like Red Bull were last year.",

Mercedes and Ferrari won't hopelessly chase McLaren when they can turn their focus on 2026 new regulations development.\n\nFor a close title fight, I say we will need Piastri to maintain the positives from his Australia performance throughout the season or Verstappen stays close in terms of points so that Red Bull have an incentive to keep pushing later into the season.\n\nI have no faith that Mercedes will do anything after they flunked this regulation era.

Eventually when a team shows so much dominance and has so many key personnel there are too many of them to have in the \"exempt\" zone, other teams will pick  them apart by being able to naturally pay several of those employees much more.\n\nRob Marshall is probably an example of that. I doubt he was one of the guys exempt at Red Bull just because of how many great minds they had at the start of the regs, and McLaren probably gave him a massive pay raise by making him one of their exempt personnel.",

It would've looked like a masterclass with the conditions we did wind up getting (with only like 3 laps of dry running before the rain hit), but if the safety car would've been 1 or 2 laps shorter, or the rain would've hit 1-2 laps later, it would've lost Red Bull a tremendous amount of time.\n\n  \nWith hindsight of how long that safety car wound up lasting, how bad the rain was and when it hit, it seems like it would've been a good move, but it could've just as well gone pretty poorly.",

I still expect them to be ahead after the China TD but Helmut seems confident in catching up to MCL after in 3-5 races. Making up around 3 tenths in 3-5 races is huge.

At this point, they might have lost 3-4 positions. If a crash happened 2 laps later, they'd have likely lost 10-12 positions. If a crash happened after 3 laps, the Ferraris would be at the back of the field regardless. \n\nSo the chances that not pitting works is a gamble on a very narrow window (basically within 90 seconds) that someone has a major crash.",
