For example, a post containing a qualifying gap between two drivers expressed in tenths of a second is an easily obtainable raw piece of data and constitutes a bad Statistics post. A visualization of what that translates to on-track, or visualization of how that gap came to be would constitute a good Statistics post.\n\n*[Read the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/userguide).

It's inexcusable to go backwards in development, when they managed to build and upgrade a very competitive car last year, just to throw it all away for a new concept *in the last year of the current regulations*. They're wasting a generational talent who's stated he wants to win a championship with Ferrari and they're about to send into retirement yet another great champion. It's sad what this once great team has turned into.",

The other takeaway I have is that he does not really do anything to calm Lewis. Former race engineers such as Steve Nichols has spoken about how part of his role was to reassure Prost that things were going well to keep his confidence up. You can tell at times Lewis is panicked because he is second guessing the decisions Ferrari is making. Bono spoke in such a way to keep Lewis focused as much as he could. GP does the same with max. This combination of Lewis and engineer needs to improve trust and communication wise if they have any hope of success. \n\n[https://youtu.be/02CU2nE9cUY?si=9jnQHG2WdC17ikw9](https://youtu.be/02CU2nE9cUY?si=9jnQHG2WdC17ikw9)",
