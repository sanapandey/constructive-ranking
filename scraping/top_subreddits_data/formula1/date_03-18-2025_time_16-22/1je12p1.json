Sorry, mate.\n\n> \"We know we still have a lot of work to do on this year's car. If you relax in this position, you fail. In Formula 1, if you start thinking things are good and groovy, that's when you get caught.\n\n> \"I do think we're favourites because the team has done an amazing job, and the car is flying. But we will have races where we struggle.\n\n> \"If we started the season in Bahrain, I don't think we would have won, and you wouldn't be asking me this question. Let's allow a few more races to take place before making any obvious statements.\"",

Trust me, people's opinions will change as they realize the RB actually is a difficult car to drive and that it gets even harder to drive throughout the season with upgrades etc. That's why Perez always started every single season well but ended them badly, even in 2024.  It's unreasonable to say he's a terrible driver because he couldn't adapt to the car. Even Horner admitted it's on a knife's edge. Albon said similar things. Liam Lawson said this too. Just watch his onboard during Melbourne qualifying, the car looks crazy twitchy",

People were saying back in 2021 that Red Bull upgrading their car all the way to the end of the season would hurt them with the new regs coming in 2022, and then Red Bull also did a great job on the new regs after getting Max the 2021 WDC.\u00a0\n\nI think even with new regs on the horizon, the trade-off between today\u2019s car and next year\u2019s car can be exaggerated. Sure, if you develop a better part for this year\u2019s car, you won\u2019t necessarily be able to just bolt it to next year\u2019s car, but you\u2019ll be learning the whole time. Especially with such limited testing, there is only so much you can do on next year\u2019s car anyway. You could easily get way ahead of yourself, pouring a bunch of effort into a 2026 concept that turns out not to work. At least if you are developing for 2025, you get to see what works and doesn\u2019t work on track, instead of just dealing with CFD and wind tunnel hypothetical performance.\u00a0",

We need to remember that teams know more about their competition's cars than we do.\u00a0\n\n\nMcLaren are also in a unique position for 2026, they don't have to develop their own PU but they also have a close relationship with their engine supplier, which makes development easier. And unlike other customer teams, the engine is the only part they get from a factory team. As far as I know, they design everything else themselves, like the gearbox and suspensions, unlike Haas for example, who use as many transferable components from Ferrari as they're legally allowed to",

China is a much more traditional circuit and also has that huge straight, which is one of McLaren's ongoing achilles heels. It could end up dominating again, or we could suddently see the field close up again.\n\nOnce we have a sample of Australia, China, Japan and Bahrain we should have a proper indication of where things really are.

It wasnt that serious a comment to begin with and it most clearly refers to the general mentality a team needs to have in this situation. And if you look at mercedes in their dominant years they would have told you a very similar thing about not becoming complacent and to always keep pushing.\n\nThat doesnt actually matter to you though. For whatever reason you have decided on your opinion (\"lando is embarassing\") and now his comments must reaffirm you opinion. Nothing he says here is \"embarassing\" in any way but you have decided that in your reality it is, because you have an opinion and it must be validated.\n\nKeep believing whatever you want to believe if it helps you sleep at night.",

Last year Max already had 7 wins before they dropped the ball and went on a winless spree for quite a number of races. Lost WCC and almost cost the WDC to Max. \n\nHaving that in mind, it's pretty obvious that at the moment McLaren is the best car but things can change pretty fast in the beginning of the season when teams are still fine tuning their cars and looking for the best setup windows.\n\nI'm not Lando's biggest fan, but if there's something about him I believe everyone agree is how pessimist, hard on himself and self-critic he is, sometimes even too much. Feels like he's being cautious with his approach and that's it. No team will win a championship is they stop developing their car after 1 race.",
