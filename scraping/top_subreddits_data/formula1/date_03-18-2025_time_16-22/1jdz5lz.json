I expect they'll leave it to the 2nd half again, despite having to do double the amount of sessions compared to what it would have been last season.

I wouldn't rule out them running someone like Antonio Fuoco once or twice though.\n\nMcLaren still have Pato O'Ward. I am not sure if Alex Dunne qualifies for a FP1 license, but if he does they can split the sessions.\n\nMercedes will likely use Frederik Vesti in the two sessions needed. I don't think their new signing Noah Stromsted has enough points.\n\nAston Martin have Felipe Drugovich and Jak Crawford. While they aren't truly invested in either really, that's an easy split of the sessions for them.\n\nAlpine will use Paul Aron. Ryo Hirakawa, who did F1 sessions last season, is another possibility. Maini has no chance. Gabriele Mini is the alternate.\n\nWilliams will use Luke Browning.\n\nHaas have a few options. They have Ritomo Miyata, Zak O'Sullivan, or any other eligible Toyota-affliated driver, as well as the Ferrari reservists (Beganovic, Fuoco) that they can use. \n\nAnd then you have Sauber. They have no affliations other than Ferrari, which is ending this year, and no reserves after their pre-season clearout. Could be anyone. Very likely to be whoever is willing to offer up some money for the two occasions.",

Mercedes was definitely better than Ferrari that year and yet, Vettel finished around 45 points off.\u00a0\nYou also have to take into consideration that Hamilton had practically no reliability problems whereas Vettel lost probably 12/15 points in Japan due to failure in early laps and probably a few more in Malaysia when his car failed in qualifying.\u00a0\nVettel was also nearly always faster than Raikkonen whereas Hamilton was beaten by Bottas a few times. That said Bottas was almost definitely a faster team mate than Raikkonen that year so maybe unfair to compare.\u00a0\n\nUltimately Vettel only made two big mistakes. One of which is really unfortunate being Singapore which was a racing incident that you can\u2019t really blame Vettel too much for because how was he supposed to know Raikkonen was going to have the most insanely start good start in the middle of a two year slump where Kimi never made a position on the first lap.\u00a0\nBaku is Vettel\u2019s other error and that was a little stupid I will admit.\u00a0\n\nHamilton crashed out in Brazil Qualifying, got himself a penalty in Bahrain, and screwed up Monaco qualifying and got knocked out in Q2.\u00a0\n\nHamilton\u2019s errors obviously arent rembered because they didn\u2019t lose him the title.\u00a0\n\n2018 is a different story because over the season Merc and Ferrari were really close with perhaps Ferrari slightly faster and yet Hamilton beat Vettel by 90 points.\u00a0",

I\u2019m guessing his age and Magnussen being a very weak benchmark contribute to his low rating.",

Magnussen is just really easy to beat, something I found a surprise myself, as F1metrics has him (and Grosjean) much higher. Depending on how Albon does vs Sainz, Latifi could change. Right now Albon is rated very high so Latifi losing to him like he did, is still seen as acceptable.\n\nStroll is remarkably consistent, as in he consistently scores in the low 30s.\n\nPersonally, I think I have it right, but of course it's really tough to disagree with your own work. When I completed the 2020s, it became clear to me why no one took Mick Schumacher, and his career in F1 is probably done.",

Unlike Piastri, Verstappen was never outperformed; he only lost out in points due to worse luck.

He was demolished in 2023 and lost 20-4 in quali last year. I struggle to believe an Ocon or Gasly wouldn't have done better.",
