It was a very rough drive for everyone and it's just impossible to say anything about Antonelli because his spin could have taken him out like all the others. He did well to drive well from there and got a good result so whether he's a future Max or a future Latifi or somewhere in between is pointless speculation.  Personally I think he's probably getting a little too much credit for the result or daylight between him and the other rookies when mostly he just spun in a better spot than the others but honestly most of the drivers had an incident or two it was really rough out there for them.  They probably all deserve to be cut some slack",
