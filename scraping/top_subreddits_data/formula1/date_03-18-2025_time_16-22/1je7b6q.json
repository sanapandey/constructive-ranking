    "selftext": "It was interesting listening to the new pairings  like Hamilton/Adami, Bono/Kimi, Hulk/HisEngineer etc., and the already established pairings like Russell/HisEngineer, GP/Verstappen, Lando/Will etc., and I must say, WOW, the difference was telling.\n\nFerrari need to change their approach because all they seem to care about is race position, rather than what track conditions are like. This goes for the drivers too because in such situations, the drivers are the ones battling the conditions and can tell what they can handle or not. \n\nThey need to be more firm just as Russell and Verstappen were about what needed to happen, else they won't ever change cause it's been happening for years. I'm surprised Hamilton wasn't more decisive but I suppose new team new relationship so he was still learning how the atmosphere would be like.\n\nBono took charge with Kimi and was understandably so. Same with Stoll, his engineer mostly made the calls and he never seemed like the type to care that much. Hulk put his experience hat on.\n\nAs for Norris and McLaren, they clearly learned from previous situations because both Lando and Will could tell that the type of rain that fell, will obviously not dry for the remainder of the race. Or they both just panicked and Lando boxed out of fear\ud83d\ude05 because Lando was quite inquisitive and tried to anticipate which is no no in F1. \n\n",

The drivers can give their input and that might change the decision some times, but the it comes down to data and, sometimes, luck. Look at Lewis and Lando in Sochi. Both wanted to stay out but Lewis followed the team\u2019s decision and that eas the right call.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to say they should have do A or B after the fact. The one thing I think Ferrari missed was not following Red Bull\u2019s call to switch to inters. There was not a great chance the track would dry quickly enough for the slicks to be an option and only a res flag would be a  good outcome. But, again, hindsight is 20/20\u2026",

                                    "body": "I think the past few years with Mercedes have been rough for Lewis, and he's become less assertive because of that.  \n\nI forgot which race it was that Lewis was told not to pit despite asking for it multiple times because they didn't want to lose track position. He was basically told that if he came in, they wouldn't change his tires. Russell ignored them and came in and got new tires. Of course, he lost track position when everyone else had new tires. This has happened a few times. \n\nThere were a couple of times that Lewis didn't agree with the strategy before or during the race, and he was shot down or talked into doing what the team wanted.  Toto and Shovlin admitted more than once last year that Lewis wanted a different  strategy, spec, or setup, and they didn't give it to him. \n\nI think Spa is the clearest example of this. Lewis asked the night before, the morning of, and during the race for the 1 stop. He was told no. Toto was asked why Lewis wasn't allowed to do a 1 stop. He said they don't let drivers change the strategy during the race because they don't have all the information the team does. Which, in previous years before 2022, is true. But in the same interview, he said George calling his own race strategy was genius.\n Lewis was expected to toe the line, and he's done that to the detriment of his own race. \n\nI think the relationship with the team in this era of regulations had been really strained. He didn't think they were going in the right direction with the car, told them that, was shut out. Toto eventually came around and said the car wasn't working out and they were changing the car for 2023. Changed his mine and kept the car the same. It wasn't until mid-season, 2023, that the rest of the team finally accepted that the zero side pod design wasn't going to work.  Add in the contract issues,  Toto only offered him a 1 year contract, and had to be pushed by the board to give Lewis a multi year contract, but it was just a 1+1. It was a difficult time for him. \n\nLewis hopefully gets out of that mindset and starts being more assertive again.",

Sometimes, drivers don't want radio in certain sections of the track or at all as it can be distracting. Some want only certain information. It's typically established between them how much and what is communicated over radio.\n\n2. The pairings, like you say in the first line, factor into it too, how long they've worked together, what works between them, etc.\n\nThat said, Ferrari gon' Rari. They have situations in which they like to give the drivers more autonomy in the strategy, which Leclerc has repeatedly shown frustration with over the years, and Hamilton is more of the type to voice his opinion after the plan has been executed.\n\nAnd the \"drivers can tell what they can handle or not\" reminds me of Stroll and Lando in Sochi. Sometimes you have to as a team take the safer option.\n\nAnd in regards to Lando pitting early, I again point to experience with Sochi.",
