But the luck factor plays a major role here too... If you stay out and the rain comes 2 corners after the pits, you're basically screwed and run the risk of binning it on your way around the whole track. If you stop and the rain doesn't come for a lap or two, you're screwed too because you'll need to stop again. You need to be extremely lucky for the rain to also come at the right time, hopefuly 1 or 2 corners before the pit entry.",

Got to be on the right tire at the right time.\n\nBasically what happened to Leclerc at Silverstone last year, they switched him to inters for rain that wasn't really that severe, he had a pace advantage for like 2 laps then it dried out and they kept him on inters until the next shower, by that time he was at the rear of the grid and had to switch to new inters anyways. When the 2nd rain shower hit and everyone had switched to inters he was over half a lap behind _Bottas!_\n\n[Timestamped in this F1 visualized video showing just how badly the inters did in the dry there](https://youtu.be/I7306tiYeZk?si=TGVtq3k6sb40p6k9&t=26)",

They're certainly more concise than Lando and Will are.   \n  \nLando and Will spent almost the entire Alonso safety car period analyzing and reiterating the game plan for what to do when the rain hit. I thought that was really clear and helped them move and decide quickly the moment Lando went off right before the pit entry.   \n  \nOn the flipside, Oscar never said or asked a thing about the rain, didn't ask if the plan was to pit or not, and didn't indicate a course of action that he preferred. That's why Tom's wording after he went off was, \"consider boxing.\" They never talked about boxing in the first place or about what tires to go on. So I do wonder if it's enough information.\n\nMax and GP are probably the balance to go for. GP said something like, \"Tell me what tire you want by Turn 13.\"",

The thing is that Lando probably would never have yelled \"no!\" on the radio if the instructions were to pit directly instead of it being a question like \"What do you think of pitting?\"  \n  \nIn McLaren's defense, there were other things going on in the big picture, too. The thing about Sochi 2021 was that it was the race after Monza 2021, the race in which they asked Lando to hold position in 2nd place to bring the 1-2 home.   \n  \nIf you watch the celebrations after Monza, you could tell that the team (esp. the mechanics) felt a level of sympathy for Lando, even in the midst of their celebrations. In 2021, he was still very much everyone's little brother figure in the team (Monaco 2021 was the race in which he was being teased by his mechanics - \"Mommy, I did a thing!\"). Lando had been in McLaren since 2017 and seemed to be their future in the way Charles was for Ferrari, and it would have been a great narrative if he had been the one to bring McLaren their first win in ages, and he didn't get to have that.\n\nMcLaren very obviously did not want to be the ones to deprive Lando of his maiden win, especially after Danny Ric had won for them just the race before and after they didn't let Lando have a shot at it.\n\nWill and Lando's dynamic is quite different from GP and Max. I can't imagine Will saying \"I'm getting very bored of this\" like GP does when Max doesn't follow what he wants. But if Will had said, \"It's going to rain a lot. We have to pit, Lando. I'm sorry.\" I totally think Lando would have done it. Will probably knows it, too. He's talked about Sochi 2021 haunting him.\n\nSo yeah, their constant communication about the rain partially stems from all this. Call it institutional knowledge. Or maybe a trauma response. \ud83d\ude05",

There was one time when GP snapped at him and told him that he could come up with the run plan himself (because Max was complaining so much). There was another time Max said sorry for being \"so on the rant\" at the end of the race. Aaaand there was another time that GP disappeared from the radio at the end of the race, and Max was like, \"Where did GP go?\" (Max had been a bit mad that race.) There was also the time that GP got annoyed with Max, and Max realized it and got him an ice cream as an apology.\n\nIt's all very domestic, really.",

I feel like different things work for different drivers.\n\nFor example, Max and GP are great, but GP's demeanor with Max likely wouldn't work with other drivers. When Max doesn't follow instructions, GP gets all sardonic and says things like, \"I'm getting rather bored of this, Max.\"\n\nI feel like that wouldn't work well with Charles (too nice for that level of sarcasm - he is the sassy one on the radio) or George (who is amusingly somewhat business-like/corporate on the radio). It might actually work for Lando, but I feel like what works best for him is just straightforward truth.\n\n(I feel like Lando hates being patronized to on the radio. Usually, his most emotive radios come from being told something that's meant to be encouraging but is maybe not 100% accurate. Some examples include Jose straight-up lying to him about him being faster on slicks in Zaandvort 2023 and Abu Dhabi 2019 when Will tries to comfort him about being slow on the hard tire.)\n\nThe \"question?\" is fine and is a common way of indicating questions on the radio. It's also sensible given that Xavi's naturally drawling and sing-songy voice makes it difficult to differentiate between questions and statements anyway.\n\nTom Stallard would make for an interesting case study. The way he communicated with Carlos was a bit different from the way he communicated with Daniel and Oscar. Carlos doesn't mind having a chat on the radio, and he likes to have a hand in the strategy calls. Daniel barely talked on the radio - complete opposite personality from outside the car. Oscar is more similar to Daniel, except he might actually give more information than Daniel did.",

Yeah, slicks.\" Both McLarens talked about this just prior to the safety car.   \n  \nCharles asked if anyone was on slicks yet right before the safety car, and his engineer was the one who said \"dry tires.\" Charles wanted the mediums but they went for the hards because that was the initial plan.   \n  \nCharles: \"I'm thinking of mediums for now. What are you planning?\"  \nEngineer: Everyone except Verstappen is on hards. Last call now! You have to tell me!  \nCharles: Okay okay, stay on hards, stay on hards, stay on hards. But freaking hell, you have to tell me first for which tires we pit, so that I can tell you.  \nEngineer: Okay, hard, hard.  \n  \nMax was the only one of the four who was saying that he wanted inters which may also be part of the reason why they went with mediums for him.

Prior to pitting, the news about the rain was: \"Class 1 for a lap or two.\" Immediately after pitting, it became \"Class 2 to 3 for 1 lap.\" (At which point, Lando asked, \"Are you confident about the one lap?\" The answer was no because Melbourne lol.) And then it became \"Class 2 to 3 for a couple of laps.\"\n\nMediums for even 20 laps with no rain would probably be enough, but they likely wanted to play it safe.

Then, after the safety car was called, George asked \"What compound are you going for?\" and his engineer told him hards.\n\nLater, he was asked to give updates on the rain. Merc was very clear about sharing their (changing) expectations about how heavy it would be, for how long, and where on track. He was told by his engineer that they've forecasted that they would have to pit for inters.\n\nHe then said the rain was getting heavier, then the McLarens went off, and he called to box, which his engineer immediately (and calmly) confirmed.\n\nHis engineer is REALLY calm.",
