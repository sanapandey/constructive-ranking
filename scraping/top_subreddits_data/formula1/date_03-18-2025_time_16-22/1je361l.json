All the rookies had tricky weekends (except Antonelli, who's looking every bit the driver that Merc think he is). But it's admittedly not looking great. \n\nMax is my least favourite driver, but he's also the best driver I've ever seen in F1 (I started watching in 2007). You'd need to be an ungodly talent in order to keep up with him. Liam just isn't that guy. I still have hope that he could improve if he gets a few normal weekends under his belt.

The race couldn't have been much harder for rookies, just ignore this race and look at their performance in the next few races. All rookies spinned, inclusing Alonso, and would have crashed out if their spins were in the same location as Doohan's, even Sainz crashed out. Further more both McLaren's could have crashed out if they had their excursion in a different location. So this race tells us nothing, except for Lawson's qualification.\n\nBut more than anything, even Lawson's qualification doesn't tell us a lot about Lawson, it tells us loads more about the car: as now 4 drivers seem to be struggling with that car. What is the most likely issue in that seat? Talent or car? Is it car, Alex?",

He is a little bit older than my oldest daughter.\n\nF1 doesn't work that way. Doohan is nobility. Jack is the son of a major figure in motor sport. His father now has his own company as sponsors for Jack. Mick Doohan is even in the box of Alpine taking care and on behalf of his son's interest. He is from a commonwealth nation, and has the support from the English Speaking media.\nFranco is just one of us. The son of a middle class mechanic from a poor country in South America. F1 is a private club and we are outsiders.\n\nYou can search for a Franco interview where he talks about it. How for any opportunity given to someone from here, that kids have 5. He dropped school and went to Europe alone at 14 yo while he was doing almost zero testing because he couldn't afford it, the other kids ran weeks of tests. He lived in an improvised room back at the factory and cooked himself plain rice in a freaking electric kettle. To wash his clothes, he went to shower with his clothes on. That kid was competing to the sons of rich families that could afford test and every weekend, they just were 1 hour away from home and normal life. When he had a crappy weekend, sometimes he just needed a hug, but he was living by his own at 14yo as an adult. Miles away from guys like Jack having his dad in the box. While Doohan has companies and lived in Monaco as neighbors of Micheal Schumacher, Franco already in F1 was using public bus to went to Williams factory. You can search in this very same reddit how people laughed about him using the same clothes a lot of weekends... \n\nOf course, that build him up. He has a lot of emotional resilience. But the field where the game is on, isn't balanced. \n\nAnd now, do you want to us believe that him has a real shot for Jack seat!? Mich Schumacher is named that way after Jack's father! Jack got a kart track as gift as kid and Michael Schumacher himself gifted him his first kart... And you are telling me that Franco has a shoot?\n\nPeople saying that Doohan will be dropped for Colapinto is in the best case scenario extremely naive or, just mocking him and in his supporters. And tbh, isn't funny anymore.\n\nEdit: and no. Isn't Jack fault or hate to him. I'm sure that Jack had to pay a lot in some situations the fact of being the son of Mick Doohan. Isn't about Jack himself, is about how the F1 world works.",

Its now a completely toxic environment to work there and they have really become the villains of F1 now.\n\nAs for the teams on how to handle younger drivers - look at how McLaren have handled Lando, and now Mercedes seem to be handling Kimi now - they have been nurtured well and looked after properly. Helmut Marko just seems to be crap at managing drivers who need their talent developing. If I was Tsunoda I would look at other teams for 2026, and just hope to god for Lawson & Hadjar that they don't have their careers destroyed by Marko.\n\nDrivers like Gasly at Alpine or Albon & Sainz at Williams are doing a lot better and have raced with a lot more with confidence since they left Red Bull/Toro Rosso.
