Chinese NBA fans have taken to naming NBA players who like to flop/dive as a \"citizen of Jingdezhen\". So who then is the \"mayor\" of Jingdezhen? James Harden naturally! Although these days I suppose Jojo Embiid will certainly have replaced Harden as mayor. Much for fitting since not only is Embiid one of the GOAT floppers, but unlike Harden he is also simultaneously literally fragile like actual procelain.",
