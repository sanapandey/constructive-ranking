Will McLaren continue to dominate with the new reqs, or will they fall back to being a best of the rest team? If Newey is correct in his assessment that it will be more of an engine formula will Mercedes or Ferrari become dominant? If Williams really is on the upswing, can they keep that momentum with new set of reqs, or are they reset back down? Audi will likely not be very good since they are just coming in, but they do take Motorsport seriously so could they pull something together in 1-2 years? Aston though I feel like is the biggest question mark there is. They have seemingly all the makings of a good car coming their way and a good chance to skyrocket back up to the top like in '23, but will it be enough?",
