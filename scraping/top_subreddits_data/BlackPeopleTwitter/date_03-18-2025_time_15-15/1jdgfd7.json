So allow me to educate you.\n\nFor starters, this isn't just about Japanese people. The video in question just happens to have a Japanese character, this (specific discussion, at least on my part) is about racism toward all Asians.\n\nBut, most notably, this isn't just about people being oppressed _now_, this is about the _history_ of oppression and racism, and the scabs that casual racism (like the video's attempt at humor) pick at.\n\nAmerica was built on the backs and blood of people that it considered (and, to this day, some still consider) as subhuman. From the Chinese that built the railroads and worked the mines, to the Japanese and Filipinos that turned barren land into farms in California and Hawai'i, to all that followed, Asians and Asian-Americans were a large and often-overlooked part of the foundation of this country.\n\nAnd for all of their work and sacrifice, they were met with violence, bigotry, and discrimination. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882; the internment of Japanese in desert camps; the Asian Exclusion Act of 1924; the massacre of Rock Springs and Watsonville Riot. The list is long and sordid.\n\nThis isn't just about a funny accent or mocking tone, this is about a long and dark history of hatred. When an Asian-American watches a scene like that, they don't just see a silly attempt and a funny voice, they see Mickey Rooney playing a horribly offensive yellowface caricature; they see decades of \"Ching Chong Chinaman\" jeers and taunts; they see signs in business windows saying \"No Dogs or Filipinos.\"\n\nThis isn't an isolated incident. It's yet another straw on a camel whose back broke decades ago. That is a far, far different thing than someone making a \"Hurdy gurdy bork bork bork\" Muppets joke.\n\nHope that helps.\n\np.s. You can't be racist toward Swedes, as \"Swede\" is not a race.",

Everyone in Europe, or most of it, is what you would consider \"white\", but we don't speak in those terms, that would be ignorance. There are differences between Swedish or Scandinavian, Slavs, Finns, Celts, French, Balkans, Germans etc. You probably can't see the differences between these people, Americans usually can't and just go with \"white\", but we can. At best you can tell the difference between a northern European and a southern European. \n\nOnly an American would say you cannot be racist \"towards Swedes\", we have been racist for centuries against each other in Europe, long before your country even existed. You just cannot see the \"shade of white\" that we can, because you're ignorant. You seem to be able to tell the difference between Japanese, Korean and Chinese, but you cannot tell the difference between white people.\n\nIt's just hilarious you're telling me what can and cannot be racist in my country, the sheer ignorance. We are not Americans. We haven't oppressed or participated much in colonialism. I actually think you're the racist one and so focused on only America that you apply what \"white people\" have done in your country to mine, when we took almost  no part in it. If I were to tell you about the Sami people I'm sure you'd be clueless on who they are and the racism/oppression they've experienced.\n\nSwede is not a race but it is an ethnicity and when speaking of racism it's irrelevant which is which.",
