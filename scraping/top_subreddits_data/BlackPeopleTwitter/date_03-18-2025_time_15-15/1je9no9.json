High demand drives up prices. We've been seeing that for the past 10 years. Throw some government money into the equation, and it gets much worse.\n\n25k sounds great, but it would put so much buying pressure on the market that few would actually benefit when prices go up by much more than that. \n\nIt's not a right wing talking point, it's economics.",

Because there\u2019s more liquidity in the market, home owners are able to raise their rates in order to capture more of that liquidity. It\u2019s an inflationary cycle.\n\nWhat you want to have happen isn\u2019t an increase in demand, you want to increase supply. The government has a couple of ways to do this.\n\n1. Increase density. More units on less land means more properties available for purchase. If liquidity remains the same, then the price per square foot drops.\n2. Subsidize the cost of the construction of housing. This could either be direct housing projects on the part of the government, or some sort of builder credit. There is nothing stopping the government from entering the housing market other than a political lack of will.\n3. Make more areas within a region housing competitive with infrastructure projects. If you have a major city with a rail network that is reliable, convenient, and has a relatively high frequency of service, then homes in the suburbs and exurbs become competitive for people who otherwise would want to shop within the city. Sprawl isn\u2019t inherently bad, it just needs to be sustainable, which rails helps in doing so.",

Rental properties reduce supply of houses to purchase and are incentivized to hoard them.\n\nOf course, we also need to increase quantity of new homes but it feels like it would be a multiplication effect with the other methods, where quantity of buyers increases, quantity of ownable homes increase, and quantity of new homes alongside.\n\nThere often isn't a single fix that magically solves all problems, we need to employ all methods and not just use the brute force ones.

But for anyone complaining it wasn\u2019t enough food\u2026 I had to cut certain things in half, but there were nice sides like fresh fruit and the aforementioned veggie options to keep me full. There were also calorie counts on the website lunch menus so I was able to keep track! \n\nWe lost some random items from the \u201cschool store\u201d but my parents didn\u2019t give me money for that kind of thing so I didn\u2019t care lol.\n\nEdit: mentioned the well to do school part because they were able to implement and improve the school lunches following the guidelines. I wish every school had the funding and resources to do so",

Because of this the food was always pink still or not fully cooked. \n\nI forgot the exact reason they did it that way but it was some stupid rule where the school wasn\u2019t allowed to do any cooking whatsoever. They could only reheat. So if you were in a public school with no money, that\u2019s what you got to eat every day. Private schools were different, they could cook food in house but again that was in Wisconsin so the rules could be different state to state. The steam cooking was in Tennessee and Mississippi. \n\nso that makes me think either certain schools had a contract with the third parties and there was an actual rule where they couldn\u2019t cook, or they were lying cuz they just wanted to save a quick buck instead of buying healthy food and making it in house.",

I think the bigger issue is that adults are constantly putting adult problems onto children rather than actually helping other adult adults. Just because we\u2019ve aged does not mean that we don\u2019t need help anymore.\n\nWhen we were kids, we can eat junk food and it won\u2019t stick to our hips and it doesn\u2019t have incredibly long lasting effects to have pizza and ice cream, because we can burn it all off. As adults it\u2019s much more important that we have access to healthy food because our lives are much busier and we need healthy nutrients to make sure that we can perform in those busy lives. \n\nI understand frustrations as a child having your fun meal taken away, and I understand as an adult why you would want to protect your child and give them healthy options, but to your point the lasting impact is the important impact. Shaking up things for kids does nothing but make them bitter.\n\nI also think this speaks to our attitude about things. Most other countries don\u2019t have this issue because they don\u2019t have as much autonomy in the decision-making process. Sometimes you just need to do things even though you don\u2019t want to do them. And in this case, that means you need to eat a healthier lunch without holding it over everybody for the next 50 years, after all that is very similar to how we got in the situation to begin with.",

I get what she was trying to do it took me awhile to forgive her and realize my anger was stupid because some stuff was more complex then that. But at the time i changed from going to an all black school to a mixed one and man the lunches were like a upgrade i only got to enjoy for a year. Got name brand snacks like rice krispie treats the little small bars and good pudding cups and stuff and it was taken away during her campaign to get kids healthy and then kids who could leave for lunch was forced to stay and either couldn't afford it cause our levies kept not passing to give more money to school so the options dropped from like 3 or 4 entrees to like maybe 2 and also just some whole grain pbjs that sat out too long and got hard sometime. I was a kid who had a single mother who was on food stamps so i originally had free lunch for the first two years of high school that became reduced lunch the last two years and i felt bad for others who didnt have any food to eat so i ended up sharing my lunches sometime with people at my school. \n\nThe quality of food went down over those 4 years and they built a new school while i was there, also levies kept failling so less money to the point they reduced food and the school bus system so a lot of us had to ride the public bus system too or end up walking far to get home. She cared about the health of others but i personally feel she could have went about it another way and really the main problems attacking americas health are not being dealt with the way they should be. But i respect her for trying to do something and caring.",

Right now the Democratic party represents two groups, educated elite professional managerial class people, and the corporations they work for.\u00a0 They do have some different policies compared to Republicans, but if you look at Kamala's policies this last election, or the one she highlighted after the convention specifically, they were all crafted to be pro-corporate pro-business in some way.\u00a0 To thread the needle between helping people and not stepping on any corporate toes, which is a recipe for shitty policy that speaks to no one.\u00a0 Reports during and after the election stated this was because Tony West, Harris's brother-in-law and head of legal at Uber, was in Kamala's ear telling her which policies to highlight with a very clear pro corporate bent.\u00a0 All that to say, as dnc chair, she would likely usher in much of the same. Same pro-corporate pro-professional stance for the Democratic party, and not implement the changes this party needs to actually win elections.\u00a0 I would suggest checking out Bernie Sanders piece on how the Democratic party lost the working class for a good intro.\u00a0 I also didn't elaborate on exactly what the party does, but like I said I have stuff to do, so feel free to do your own research on that one",

Let that lady go sit down somewhere and rest after doing what she could for the last 4 years. \n\nThere isn't really much by way of intervention that can be done here. Kamala would be doing the same things that everyone else in the democratic party can do. Call out that this sucks, which isn't news, and try to make the case for 2026. There isn't really an option where they stop Trump from doing whatever stupid thing he and Elon come up with next because they pulled the hat trick. They have the white house, congress, and SCOTUS. The fix is going to be community-level for awhile. Go find a place where you live that allows you to make an impact. Donate money. If you don't have money, donate skills. If you don't have skills, donate time. That's how we're going to get through this. Democrats can't do anything but really just have beef like everyone else",

They're just trash at actually explaining what they want to do in an effective manner. Building a case for 2026 isn't on Kamala though. She's not in office. Last I heard, she was considering running for governor in CA. She might be done with federal politics. The discussion about stronger voices has also put a spotlight on the idea that there needs to be more work on a person to person level. People are growing more and more distrusting of the normal sources for information. People don't trust politicians, journalists, and science/math/data. They listen to people they think are in the know. If you're already working within your community, then your voice is probably going to hold more weight to the historically undecided or maybe even republican than anyone that comes out of government. And that's still a very different conversation than what the picture above is discussing. This element of it is already underway though. People who voted for trump outside of the core MAGA camp are getting burned. Famers, people on government assistance, people who had or benefit from corporate jobs, etc, have all taken an L and we aren't even 90 days in yet. Like it's not a secret that this sucks unless people are indifferent because they haven't been affected yet or because they don't want to admit they helped create the problem. So a lot of this is going to take some time\n\nDemocrats need to go out and engage people for sure right now since they're still reeling from those L's. Bernie has been doing a few rallies in states that have some winnable elections, for example. That sort of thing helps and needs to be the focus. But you have to also understand and accept that people wanted this. If they still need to be massively convinced after they almost lost snap/medicaid/their job, then I don't really know what message or offer you can make to them to convince them to flip. And that's the best case for what they can do right now. All they have is pointing out that this sucks and hoping to that people will listen this time when they offer something better.",

Had she won the election, she wouldn't have had the luxury of stepping into the shadows. if anything she should have planned to be a public figure and leader in the current year anyway, and anything she would do right now would still be less effort/responsibility than the role of president\n2. Her not stepping up to meet the moment confirms the fears that many people had \u2013 that she really wasn't the right candidate and isn't the leader we needed, and that's tough to swallow",

California is the richest state in the country, there is an insane hustle culture here and the wealth inequality is some of the largest in the whole country. Dems coast because there's no strong oppostition to them. Democrats who put corporate profit first will never be widely electable. \n\nBtw this isn't even taking into account the widespread, damaging propaganda pumped into the other 49 states about what a shithole, disaster california is. They don't even understand that california is carrying the american economy on their back. Why would they ever elect a californian?",

Inspiring hope amongst those that feel hopeless and attacked right now. AOC is using her position of power to very effectively communicate as well. \n\nThese are people in government that take their responsibilities, their power that they hold in the public eye, very seriously. They give a shit, they do actions to back up their words.\n\nThere is a reason Kamala isn't around, and we're better off for it. She's fraudulent, she's inauthentic, she has no grasp on the current state of the country, and the despair of the working poor, and I'd imagine she also has just as little a grasp on where her own fucking party is at this point too, just like Schumer. Both swine of the same ilk. Both legacy, neoliberal frauds, both need to go, and never fucking come back. She found glee in campaigning with Republicans. Liz fucking Cheney for fucks sake, who has famously gone on camera and stated that [DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO KILL BABIES AFTER THEY'RE BORN.](https://x.com/donwinslow/status/1831470526948372510) LIKE, HELLO?!\n\nYour girl Kamala paraded this fucking woman around like a goddamn prize. And you'll die on your hill to all tell me she is your candidate? Your chosen champion? Be fucking for real you clowns.\n\nWHY THE FUCK WOULD ANYONE WANT A DEMOCRAT, WHO ENTERTAINS A PERSON LIKE THIS? Kamala chose a loser's strategy, and oh boy did we all fucking lose because of it. Y'all are fucking delusional to think it's anything other than that. Public polls the entire fucking time she campaigned showed increasingly disaffected voters with her continuous strategy to steer further and further right wing. As if that wasn't enough, they revealed post-election that even DEMOCRATS' OWN INTERNAL POLLS THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN RUN UP, **NOT ONCE**, HAD KAMALA AHEAD OF TRUMP IN THE RACE. AND YET, THEY REFUSED TO SWITCH UP. AND Y'ALL ARE STILL SITTING HERE LIKE CUCKED DOGS WAITING FOR HER TO COME BACK AND DO IT ALL AGAIN LMFAO.\n\nBE. FUCKING. FOR REAL.\n\nShe's a worthless, corporate puppet candidate, and best serves the people by keeping herself far as fuck away from any position of government power. We need people who give a shit. That is not, and has never been Kamala Harris.",

I don't think we should give a single politician the power that a cult of personality provides. Trump is unilaterally going on a HoF spree rn bc nobody can push against him, even in his own party. There is no criticism of Trump. He's been able to get away with so much bc of that political power. For that reason, I don't think cults of personality like this have any place in our government. \n\nAnyways, I don't think our main issue right now is the lack of stronger representatives.

I don't really know how you fix that other than left wing authoritarianism. Proper democracy relies on an even playing field, but that just does not exist.

To abdicate that role when the nation is in crisis is to signal that one's commitment to democracy was conditional, performative, or self-serving. \n\nIt is indefensible to argue that merely warning about the danger absolves one of the responsibility to confront it when it arrives. The moral weight of leadership does not expire when the ballots are counted or when the transfer of power occurs. To retreat in silence while authoritarianism takes hold is not just cowardice\u2014it is complicity through inaction. \n\nEqually contemptible are those who assume, without evidence, that anyone demanding more from these figures must not have voted. This lazy and defensive argument serves only to deflect accountability from those who promised leadership but vanished when it was needed most. Democracy is not upheld by passive spectatorship or empty rhetoric; it requires continuous, visible resistance from those who sought to lead.",

Personally, I don\u2019t find the extreme corporatism of the Obamas to be exciting or inspiring. The people pushing the Bush-Bush, Clinton-Clinton, Obama-Obama legacy presidencies need to be honest and admit they just want royalty. \n\n\nHow bout an actual grassroots candidate who has proven her allegiance to the working class over corporations like AOC?",

Bernie and AOC are out there doing rallies and saying what people want to hear, they're tweeting about resisting, working social media, they're out there. They don't have significant power in government to do anything about it legislatively, but they're still LEADING. If you believe in democracy then being out there and building support is important to actually fixing this mess. Kamala had no message and no real popular standing in the party, and now she's gone.\n\nIt also feels very hypocritical to run a campaign almost entirely about the \"grave threat to democracy\" and then when you lose, have nothing more to say about it. So like, is democracy on the line? Is democracy even important? Because if it was you'd still be out there trying to rally support.\n\nI get that it was a tough campaign, that she's a human being who needs rest, etc etc, that's not the issue here. If you just up and disappear for 6 months the moment you lose to such a \"dire threat\" then its pretty obvious you weren't invested in it to begin with. I don't think this gripe is about people wanting Harris back; I think the gripe is more pointing out how poor of a candidate she was and how the democratic party refuses to field real leadership or entertain any grassroots sentiments.",

The establishment Democrats failed to stop this from happening (while using the threat of the looming right wing takeover to kneecap progressive policies and economic agenda) and now that Trump is in power again, they are refusing to put up a fight.
