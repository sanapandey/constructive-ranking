Maybe Kanye had more going on then and wasn't that involved in the surgery idk... And I guess you can't force people not to do something if they're set on it, but I feel he could have done more to stop this tbh after reading up more about it. I was always under the assumption that the lipo was the cause of death due to hitting an artery or something and she died on the table so learning she actually died afterwards is crazy. I wonder if he ever saw Kim in her post op garments, drugged up, and thought of his mother? How he could let the mother of his children do surgery after surgery back to back after his own mother died because of one is crazy... Granted donda had health conditions that made the surgery go bad but surgery in itself is so dangerous and he knows that!",
