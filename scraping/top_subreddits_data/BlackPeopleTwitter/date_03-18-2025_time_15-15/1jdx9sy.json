France and the U.S. have both profited (and continue to do so) unimaginably from oppression and stolen labor and resources from communities and cultures of color. And France can call out American hypocrisy. Both things can be true. Not an excuse by any means. Just a shitty truth.",

Just watch \u201cGangs of New York\u201d to see what a voluntary \u201c melting pot\u201d America has been. \n\nBut the fact is, we were given the statue as a symbol of our willingness to be that melting pot. This has always benefited America too. The populous dictates the true wealth of a nation. It has been because we took everyone in that we grew to be as strong as we were. \n\nOligarchs have convinced uneducated, disadvantaged white people who still make up the majority of America that America was founded as a white Christian nation and that their birthrights have been stolen by foreigners. \n\nThis is always the play. They grab up some underachievers, convince them that they were robbed, and not just pathetic fools. Tell them that all of their shortcomings are someone else\u2019s fault, and task them with spreading the false narrative. \n\nAmerica was a melting pot. Was then convinced it never was. And now it\u2019s a great threat to humanity in the form of racial division and industry run amok. \n\nThe good news is: America is where we were born but it\u2019s not who we are. America is its people. All of its people. I\u2019m not proud to be an American, I\u2019m proud ( sometimes ) of being a human with humanity in mind. \n\nNothing in this world works unless we let it. The thing to remember above all else: The people in power can\u2019t feed or clothe themselves without the people They\u2019ve put in place around them. \u201c we are the people who guard you while you sleep \u201c. Their power is the biggest illusion we face on a daily basis. They have none other than what we\u2019ve conceded.",

For the Western Powers, Germany had been a bigger thorn in their side then Japan had been: Franco-Prussian War, World War 1, etc and as a result UK, France, etc felt Germany had a lot with its National Psyche to be undone. The root of problem wasn't just with Hitler/Nazis. It goes back further:\n\n(1) German Militarism was a broad cultural and social phenomenon between 1815 and 1945, which developed out of the creation of standing armies in the 18th century. This would lead into increasing influence of military culture deep into civilian life. Going back to the Prussians, Minister Friedrich von Schr\u00f6tter remarked that, \"Prussia was not a country with an army, but an army with a country\" with having the each social class being expected to serve the state and its military \u2014 the nobility led the army, the middle class supplied the army, and the peasants composed the army.\n\n(2) Military Ruling Class. Up above I mentioned each social class being expected to serve the state and its military. The Nobility were called Junkers. These were of the landed nobility in Prussia. They owned great estates in the country that were maintained and worked by peasants with few rights. Given land went to elder son the other kids ended up in the military and political areas. After 1871(Start of the German Empire or Second Reich), German military, political, and diplomatic leadership. And would continue till 1933. Some famous Junkers include:\n\n* Otto von Bismarck -- German statesman and diplomat who oversaw the unification of Germany and served as its first Chancellor from 1871 to 1890. Bismarck's Realpolitik and firm governance resulted in him being popularly known as the Iron Chancellor \n\n* Manfred von Richthofen -- was a fighter pilot with the German Air Force during World War I. He is considered the ace-of-aces of the war, being officially credited with 80 air combat victories. Aka The Red Baron. \n\n* Paul von Hindenburg -- led the Imperial German Army during the First World War and later became president of Germany from 1925 until his death in 1934. He played a key role in the Nazi seizure of power in 1933 when he appointed Adolf Hitler as chancellor of Germany.\n\n* Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben -- a German-born American army officer who played a leading role in the American Revolutionary War by reforming the Continental Army into a disciplined and professional fighting force. His contributions marked a significant improvement in the performance of U.S. troops.\n\n* Helmuth von Moltke the Elder -- He commanded troops in Europe and the Middle East, in the Second Schleswig War, Austro-Prussian War, and Franco-Prussian War. He is described as embodying \"Prussian military organization and tactical genius\".[2] He was fascinated with railways and pioneered their military use. He is often referred to as Moltke the Elder to distinguish him from his nephew Helmuth von Moltke the Younger (Helmuth Johann Ludwig von Moltke), who commanded the German army at the outbreak of the First World War. \n\n* Claus von Stauffenberg -- German army officer who is best known for his failed attempt on 20 July 1944 to assassinate Adolf Hitler at the Wolf's Lair, part of Operation Valkyrie, a plan that would have seen the arrest of Nazi leadership in the wake of Hitler's death and an earlier end to World War II. Others in the plot included Gottfried Graf von Bismarck-Sch\u00f6nhausen(a Grandson of Otto von Bismarck), \n\n* Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck -- As a general in the Imperial German Army and the commander of its forces in the German East Africa campaign. For four years, with a force of about 14,000 (3,000 Germans and 11,000 Africans), he held in check a much larger force of 300,000 British, Indian, Belgian, and Portuguese troops. He is known for never being defeated or captured in battle.\n\n* Erich von Manstein -- a German Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) in the Heer (Army) of Nazi Germany during World War II. He was subsequently convicted of war crimes and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment. \n\n* August von Mackensen -- one of the German Empire's most prominent and competent military leaders. After the armistice of 11 November 1918, the victorious Allies interned Mackensen in Serbia for a year.\n\n* Carl von Clausewitz -- a Prussian general and military theorist who stressed the \"moral\" (in modern terms meaning psychological) and political aspects of waging war. His most notable work, Vom Kriege (About War), though unfinished at his death, is considered a seminal treatise on military strategy and science. \n\n(3) Social Darwinism which is a body of pseudoscientific theories and societal practices that purport to apply biological concepts of natural selection and survival of the fittest to sociology, economics and politics. Social Darwinism came to play a major role in the ideology of Nazism, which combined it with a similarly pseudo-scientific theory of racial hierarchy to identify the Germans as a part of what the Nazis regarded as an Aryan or Nordic master race. The United States, Japan, and China also had/have issues with this. The term first appeared in 1877.",
