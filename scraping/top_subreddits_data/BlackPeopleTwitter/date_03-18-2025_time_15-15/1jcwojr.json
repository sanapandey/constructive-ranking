[Random screenshot from a quick google](https://i.imgur.com/LUjo6ZP.jpeg).\n\nI remember watching some of them (there were several videos that resurfaced) and they seemed pretty bad. Doja Cat was (in the videos I saw) the only person in the chat who wasn't a white guy, and was basically holding court / the center of attention. And the other chatters were openly saying some really racist shit.\n\nFor context, they were like tinychat rooms (which were a thing for a while in like 2010-2015ish). There were tons of racist ones, but also for all sorta of degenerate shit but also fairly normal ones. The ones dojacat was involved in might not have been \"tinychat\" per se as there were other similar websites / platforms, but yeah. Getting into a video chat with like 5-20 other people was a thing for a while.\n\nGroups of usually teens or young adults would get together in video chat rooms and shoot the shit for hours, usually based around some kind of topic. I used to occasionally visit one that was filled with out and proud alcoholics when I was an alcoholic (though this crowd was decidedly older than most. A lot of 30-40 year olds).",
