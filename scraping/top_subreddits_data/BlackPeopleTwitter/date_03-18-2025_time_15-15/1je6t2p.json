I remember wondering why we were told to look down on the LGBT community when someone like me knew what it was like to be discriminated against, even as a middle schooler. Honestly the black community is quite homophobic still because of Christianity, which I do lament. Which is crazy to me cause much of the evangelical Christian community hates us. But whatever. \n\nWhen trump got elected, the things the church members would write on Facebook were quite hateful, and the church openly endorsed him. Even a few years back my parents stopped giving money to the church and switched to a majority black church 30 minutes away.",
