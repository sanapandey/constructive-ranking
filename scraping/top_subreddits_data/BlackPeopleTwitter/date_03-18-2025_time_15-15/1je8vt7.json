It does give universities more independence in that they aren't completely dependent on tuition or state funding, but the investment side of their operations begins having a bigger and bigger impact and can be incongruent with their educational mission.\n\nThe university I went to (not Ivy, but still a big name, big endowment school) was doing some reckless stuff with their piggy bank. They were buying up property near campus like crazy, which was driving rent way up and screwing over students like me who were already choosing between rent and food. This was like 10+ years ago, so I'm afraid to think what rent is like there now. They also had some very questionable investments in the Middle East that reflect even more poorly on them a decade later.\n\nAll that said, the university also gave me a lot of grant money that allowed me to finish college without resorting to private loans. I wasn't a good student, an athlete, or anything that people tend to get scholarships for. I just walked into the finaid office one day and told them I'm out of money and desperate, and they did more than I could've hoped for.\n\nI agree with the post, though. If schools are changing standards so that admission is based solely on grades, advanced coursework, and test scores without consideration of the context in which those achievements were made, there will be very, very few students who aren't from wealthy families.",

Note the decline of like all public services once they couldn't discriminate based on race anymore. No more public pools. Public parks get into disrepair. Education becomes less accessible.\n\nNow that civil rights are slowly getting turned back, watch how many things become more accessible again while being de facto segregated.",
