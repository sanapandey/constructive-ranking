MICHELLE OBAMA?! In order to support *him*??? The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost can't give this man the \"support\" he's looking for!!! \n\n\u201cMajors later texted Jabbari and pleaded with her not to go to the hospital, according to the suit and evidence shown at trial, saying, 'I fear you have no perspective of what could happen if you go to the hospital. They will ask you questions and as I don\u2019t think you can actually protect us it could lead to an investigation even if you do lie and they suspect something.'\"\n\nWhen he said \"protect us\" he meant \"protect *me*\". Pathetic.\n\n\"Majors has never directly publicly apologized for his behavior towards his ex-girlfriends and has denied ever being physically abusive to women. In an interview with Good Morning America ahead of his April 2024 sentencing, Majors said while he might not have been the \u201cbest boyfriend at the time,\u201d he insisted that he had \u201cnever hit a woman.\u201d \u201cMy hands have never struck a woman, ever,\u201d he added.\" and \"Majors has denied being physically abusive to Jabbari.\" \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAlmighty God, I wonder where he purchased that military-grade audacity from because that thing could withstand a direct hit from a nuclear bomb.\n\nDisgusting.",
