                    "body": "Deepseek-R1 is good, IME, for philosophy stuff and Socratic dialogue. My way of telling whether an LLM is gonna be accurate for my uses is to ask it to compare and contrast Max Stirner's Egoism and Ayn Rand's Egoism. Chat-GPT, Llama, and Olmo are not good at answering this, but deepseek-R1 is the first to give me actual nuance in a response, and be able to actually express the implied preclusions of these ideologies when implemented IRL (which the rest all failed at doing). Its helped me with other things I do have good knowledge about, like chemistry and pharmacology stuffs.\n\nI think the thinking/deep thought models are gonna be a good improvement as they introduce \"doubt\" and \"confidence\" to the LLM in a more direct way, and it makes them more wary of saying things theyre not completely certain of. If trained on good data (this is the key), then these should be pretty trustworthy for general information purposes. But AFAIK deepseek is taking their model creation more seriously than companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta which are literally dumping any and all information into the model, much to its own chagrin, frankly (like you mentioned with the suggesting rocks, or suggesting glue on pizza). Ive never had this type of issue with deepseek-R1 (yet).\n\nOverall though I still think the only real actual good use of LLMs is for Socratic dialogue. They are actually really good at this. Next time youre trying to figure out what you believe or something, talk to AI about it and prompt them explicitly to do a Socratic dialogue (i.e,. \"I want to start a Socratic dialogue to discuss criticisms of religion. [Question or assertion here]\"). \n\nThis is coming from someone who is deeply critical of LLMs btw. I detest all the \"creative\" uses for LLMs, hate how theyre stealing jobs, distrust those who are running them (which is why I run my models locally using Ollama and ChatboxAI), and hate the power/water consumption of these LLMs (also why I run local). And I definitely hate how LLMs are being used for support chatbots now; theyre worse than the old simple ass preprogrammed ones. \n\nI dont think they are to be used for most of the things people use them for, this doesnt make them useless overall though. I think Deepseek-R1 is a step in a better direction too, one which I feel will result in more accurate answers from LLMs so long as training data is somewhat curated to be actually, y'know, good data.",

I get the occasional wrong answer but it\u2019s usually quickly identifiable when I do a bit more research into the sources provided.
