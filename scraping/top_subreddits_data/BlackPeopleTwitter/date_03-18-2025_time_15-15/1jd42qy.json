ASL translators must be able to translate any sentence from English to ASL and just omitting entire word types would cause a breakdown in communication.\n\nASL isn\u2019t \u201chand English\u201d, it\u2019s its own fully fledged language with its own vocabulary and grammar. A native ASL speaker would understand anything better in ASL than they would in English.\n\nThe Donald Glover bit is the perfect example. His d/Deaf fans would completely miss the joke if there wasn\u2019t a sign for it. Or for history students/researchers, studying historical documents or old speeches would be much easier for them in ASL so a translation would need to include any words, no matter how repugnant or outdated, for them to be able to understand. Most importantly, d/Deaf people aren\u2019t glass creatures that need to be sheltered. They\u2019re entitled to the language needed to discuss (their own experiences with) racism and discrimination.",
