I was homesick but excited for all the new possibilities and getting away from a very abusive ex husband. Very happy I made the move as I found my current husband and have been very happy with him for almost ten years. Even when I was living here and single one of the best parts was knowing nobody and nobody knowing my business.",

So when I first left, it was absolutely thrilling but also kinda terrifying. On one hand, it felt like the world was my oyster with endless possibilities, and on the other, it was like, \u201cWhat am I doing without my 'home' pizza place and all my go-to spots?\u201d\n\nThe first few months were the hardest. You bet I was homesick, like, big time around the holidays and random weekends when everyone was hanging out without me. I mean, something as simple as not knowing where to find good bagels in a new town made me desperate to go back. But it was also wildly exciting to experience new places and meet new folks.\n\nFeeling homesick was like riding a rollercoaster, especially at night when you just want to see familiar faces. But I just tried to remind myself why I made the move. I really did want to step out of that childhood bubble and find out who I was without the comfort zone of my hometown.\n\nOver time, things got easier\u2014like, I found MY coffee shop, made friends, and discovered stuff I loved about my new place. Every little win, like finding that perfect park or making a friend, was a mini victory. Oh, and technology helps a ton, doesn\u2019t it? A quick video call can make you feel way more connected when you're feeling a bit lost.\n\nLooking back, I\u2019m happy I stuck it out. Eventually, you create new routines and it becomes its own kind of comfort. It\u2019s pretty darn satisfying when you look back and realize how much you\u2019ve grown. But yeah, some days a bit of that hometown nostalgia creeps in and makes you wonder what would\u2019ve been different if you\u2019d stayed put. I guess that thought for another time.",

I went back and forth on it a few times, but something that brought me comfort was knowing that if things didn\u2019t work out I could always move back home.

Not to escape my hometown or with any particular plans to change as a person (obviously I knew I was gonna change as a person no matter what because I was 18, but like that wasn't the goal in moving), I just thought living abroad for a while would be fun. And it turned out it was! I had a great time, I thought my personality and temperament suited the Spanish culture much more than the German one and I immediately felt at home there. I quickly made some friends and I also really enjoyed living in a big city as someone who grew up on the countryside. Also as a lgbt person I thought it was very liberating living in such a gay-friendly place as Madrid.\n\nBut it was also difficult sometimes with figuring out all the stuff that is different and especially the language. I had Spanish in school for 4 years, but turns out that means fuck all. It took me like 5 months before I finally didn't feel completely lost and even then it was just exhausting having to live in a language you're not fluent in. It requires so much brain power for tasks that ordinarily don't need any brain power. Like suddenly the cashier asks you if you want a bag in a slightly different way and you're like \"wait what\" and you need to actually think about it. In German or even in English that interaction involves no real thinking, but in Spanish it did and it's just a thousand little things like that all day long that add up. \n\nI genuinely didn't feel homesick while I was there, but then when I visited home for the first time after like a year I stepped off the plan in Munich and the first person to speak to me was some airport employee with a thick Bavarian dialect and I immediately burst into tears at hearing my dialect spoken again. So I guess I must have been homesick after all.",

My mom and I weren't very close at the time and she disapproved of me going so far away for school, but she was very comforting over the phone, with words like, don't be scared, you'll be ok. It took me about a month to make friends and once I did i was in fact, ok. \n\nSecond time was when I moved out of the country. And it was the same thing \ud83e\udd23. Immediately regretted the move. Missed my friends and family. Took me about three months to acclimate and once I did i didn't look back. \n\n> Were you happy you made the move away from family and hometown so you could become your own person and escape the hometown bubble?\n\nYes. It was an opportunity to explore different sides of me that I wouldn't have explored because in my family and hometown, i already had a role set out for me within my friend group and family and we get so used to playing those roles. Moving away is an opportunity to grow out of those roles, take on new ones, etc. \n\nFwiw, i don't think moving away is the *only* way to achieve this- you just have to get out of your comfort zone. But that can be more difficult to do when you're in ur comfort zone.",

I knew that there was a whole world out there, and I wanted to experience it. I really wanted to go to college out of state, but I couldn\u2019t afford it, so I spent my early adult years going to a college only an hour away. Even that was better than my hometown, but I still was desperate to get out of the state. I finished college in May of 2020, and my already limited opportunities in that state became almost nonexistent. That\u2019s when I decided that it was time to go. It was terrifying but exciting at the same time.\n\nI only moved one state away, 6 hours away so that I was still fairly close to home, but to a large metro area. The first year was the hardest. It was the pandemic, it was my first time all on my own, and I had no idea what I was doing. It took me some time to get on my feet. After a year, I met my partner and we moved in together. I found a job that I loved and built a community around that. At first I did not miss home at all. As the years went on, I started appreciating my culture more. I started to look forward to my once or twice a year visits home. I was disappointed in my family because they never came to visit me, but it is what it is I guess.\n\nA few months ago, I decided to move again. The place I chose just wasn\u2019t working out, and I wanted to seek better opportunities. So now I\u2019m in a new state! I don\u2019t know if this my forever home or not, but I\u2019m going along for the ride. Each place I\u2019ve lived has been an adventure. It\u2019s not an easy path and you\u2019ll have to be prepared for change. But I\u2019m glad that I took the chance. Sometimes it makes me sad that I don\u2019t get to celebrate Christmas with my family, that I don\u2019t get to eat my comfort foods, or that I rarely see my friends anymore. But ultimately, getting out was the best thing I\u2019ve ever done for myself.",

I kept pushing it forward because I wanted to stay at my current job a full 3+ years before going anywhere. While visiting with my bf, I ended up losing my job because of my old boss\u2019s health issues. My bf was all for me moving there asap because now the job piece was gone and I agreed but I was in a lease back home. When I returned from my trip, I had mold in my apartment!

I was two years out of college, had worked freelance in theater for a while, traveling around,  but was planning to settle a bit. \n\nMy college friend's father had a former colleague from the theatrical business who had a small opera company which operated primarily during the summer on Martha's Vineyard, and she needed a costume designer for a week, and would pay $500. I said sure, why not?\n\nKnowing a little of costume design and nothing of the Vineyard, I drove 12 hours via 81 and 95 (hell) for the first time in my grandpa's early-oughts stick shift Dodge Dakota and caught the ferry at Woods Hole at about 10pm. I was greeted by my new employer, W, with a hug, and driven to a beautiful gated estate where the cast was staying (only to learn later that it was just the guest house), where an amazing meal had been prepared and all 15-20 of us sat down at the long rustic table to enjoy. \n\nThat week was a whirlwind. The costumes were... okay. The rehearsal space was a \"barn\" on the same estate owned by an elegant German woman named Claudia who joked she'd bought the property for her dog. I stayed in a little cottage with my employer, in the little attic room. It was light and sunny and wonderful. \n\nI could go on just about that week, but it continues.  \n\nW asked me to stay on to help her with hosting two women who were coming for the African American Film Festival, so I did, and got to hang out with and chauffeur around two gorgeous French women and Karine's tiny poodle to the various events, went to the beach, and even held up a Black Dog ship when they decided last minute they wanted to go.  \n\nThen W asked me to stay and basically manage her company, and help her with the logistics of an upcoming project back at Claudia's estate. So I did. \n\nI went home for a few weeks at Christmas, then went back to the Island and lived there for the next 3 years.  \n\nI worked for W, did housekeeping at a bed & breakfast, hostessed at a restaurant, worked in a greenhouse/ for a garden center, worked at a couple art galleries, for yet another wealthy woman's pet art project....\n\nI made friends with a lot of the Serbian kids who came over to work, went out to the bars and clubs, joined a coven, hiked, walked the beaches, moved every 6 months, lived in other people's houses, fell in love, fell out of love, learned a lot, lived a lot...\n\nGoing to work on the Vineyard for a week and staying for three years was one of the best decisions of my life.",

I show up and partake in family events sometimes.... when they remember to invite me. But so I hear is that I'm never around. I'm around when invited and go out of my way. They seem to forget that if they forget to let me know of events,  I can't make it. I've lived with being forgotten. Treating me like it's my fault is different though. You planned with every body except me. Don't treat me like trash because you forgot to invite and I was either at work or made other plans when you last minute remembered I existed and forgot about me.",

I still miss home but also feel it\u2019s more special now when I go back and see friends/family. Making friends as an adult is really hard so that was the toughest bit and it\u2019s definitely a different connection than the one you have with your childhood friends, but technology now means it\u2019s really easy to stay in contact with them too!",

I did deal with a lot of homesickness, it was hard for a few years having to leave them. I adjusted when i got into my masters program at the same school. I moved again for my career, 2 hours closer to home so it makes visiting a little more manageable. I do miss being with my family sometimes, but it's not consuming like it used to be.",

I was 22, fresh out of college, and ready to \u201cadult\u201d. I learned very quickly that there was A LOT I didn\u2019t know about the mundane,  everyday things like cooking and laundry. Other than that, my experience was really good. I gained a sense of independence that never would have been possible if I\u2019d stayed in my hometown. I had adventures, made new friends, found my go-to spots, many of which I still visit today. If you\u2019re contemplating a move AND CAN AFFORD IT, go for it! \n\nIf you\u2019re feeling lonely or homesick, my advice is to focus on the reason you moved. Keep that in mind. And you can feel more at home in your new community by taking up a group hobby. I took up tennis and joined a women\u2019s volleyball league.",

I love my parents and other brothers, but I didn't really miss them.\n\nEither I or my parents will visit at least once/twice a year, so it wasn't that bad.\n\nBut I had a roommate that was incredibly homesick to the point where she'd cry. So if that's homesick, I definitely was not. She grew up and her parents literally lived 2hrs away. Honestly made me question if I'm just unnaturally cold/emotionally repressed/hardened or if Americans were very... not.\n\n**Were you happy you made the move?**\n\nNeutral.\n\n**Context**:\n\nBorn and lived first few years in CAN, moved to UK in childhood, then EastAsia for secondary school, then moved on my own when I was \\~15 for uni (US). Younger brother joined me a year later. Did a yr abroad in another country in EastAsia. Went back to \"1st\" EastAsia (where half my extended family is) for a few years, then went to AUS (on my own) for my 2nd postgrad degree. Then back to EastAsia.\n\nSo maybe it doesn't really count since for most of the time I did have my brother around in US and he was/is one of my bestfriends.",

I'm working class and international travel is out of the picture for me. Getting halfway across the country and living in a small city with a high ex-pat population changed my world view and my view of my family and hometown culture forever. It was like a true melting pot and the culture was so different and friendly and open. Coming home was pure culture shock. Back to people treating me with contempt if I dared to smile or say hello on the street. Honestly I think I'll never recover until I can leave this place again. If you find your real home, don't let anything or anyone drag you back to the one you left.",
