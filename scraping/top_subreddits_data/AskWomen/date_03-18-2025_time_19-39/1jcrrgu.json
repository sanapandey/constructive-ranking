Focuses on getting me there moreso than other partners have (including my ex husband.) We talk about things that may work or things we can try. I'll get to the point where it feels like I really have to pee and I can't seem to get myself around that mental block, he relaxes me and reassures me that it's okay if we make a mess. He makes sure he's not hurting me and that everything feels good. Never puts pressure on me or makes me feel terrible that we haven't been able to get me there like that. That being said, he's very generous with oral and wants to make sure I'm having at least the same amount of pleasure, and most times even more. Even without the internal orgasm, the amount of love and care he puts into our intimate times makes it the best sex I've been having in my life.",

That\u2019s to say that the most perfect man in the world could not make me orgasm if I was not fully engaged and present with him. Be careful when you assume it's all his fault. \n\nFor me, what matters is his commitment and intention. Does he love me? Does he respect me? Does he *try* to meet my needs both sexually and emotionally? Is he open to feedback and compromise? And is it reciprocal on my end? If the answers above are yes, then I don't see why we can't make it work. There are so many solutions out there, the most minimum being toys. \n\nAnd you know what? Sometimes life gets very stressful/depressing and it impacts the libido of one or both partners. In this situation, I think it's best to focus on reducing the stressors and providing emotional support. Sexual pressure and expectations only worsen things. For everyone. Sex is not the only way to express love, and personally I am not cool with commodifying sex in my relationships. \n\nMy goal: don\u2019t marry for a dick, marry for a man.",

Some people prefer to decentralize orgasming altogether & focus on pleasure. Of course some people don't have PIV intercourse at all. There are lots of ways to achieve sexual intimacy.\n\nIf you're talking about someone's anatomy not working well with yours, I recommend trying alternatives like foreplay or toys or other ways you can get off with your partner.\n\nAgain, if your partner isn't willing to try *anything,* that's a dealbreaker.",

He was patient, kind and he had the stamina to back it up. He almost guaranteed my orgasms, even though I hadn't orgasmed a single time with my ex.\n\nMy ex viewed sex differently. I was his blow-up doll and whether or not I had a good time was primarily my responsibility, not his. He could also be rather quick and he didn't allow for optimizing sensations for me. It led to some tension in me, the lack of trust and the knowledge that he didn't care that much about me made it hard for me to fully let go.\n\nIn general I would say: if a man wants to have sex on you instead of with you, don't marry him.",

The only one who can make me orgasm is myself. \n\nMy partner now who I\u2019ve been with for a couple years isn\u2019t able to make me orgasm but he puts a lot of effort into making me feel good. I enjoy having sex with him, it feels amazing both physically and emotionally. I usually make myself orgasm at the beginning, middle, or end of sex.\n\nHe keeps making the effort to make me orgasm but he doesn\u2019t make it about himself like previous partners have; that used to lead to a lot of anxiety for me. He\u2019s gotten me relatively close a couple times but hasn\u2019t gotten me over the edge yet.",

Sooner or later more than just sex will be a problem. I like to think I am quite good at communicating, I'm not great but when it comes to sex I'm a damn encyclopedia. I believe communication is the biggest asset in this scenario. These things can be fixed if they are open to what makes you orgasm. However if you speak with them and it's not working, time to go.",

My sex life now is better than it has ever been, better than I even thought possible! Because my husband cares about me, and wants me to have a good time too. Because of this, sex no longer feels like a chore or a job to sit through until it's over.
