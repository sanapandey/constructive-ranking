            "body": "I'm overweight right now. I breathe heavier going up a flight of stairs or even just showering. Shaving certain areas, I literally have to suck in my gut to see what i'm doing. I actually feel heavy, I literally can feel gravity pulling at my mass lol. My lower back hurts more, my knees hurt more, things hurt a lot more.\n\nI'm more aware of it since I used to be really skinny, really active, then covid hit... It hasn't been the same since. I've gained 40-50lbs and rolls in places I never had before. I remember seeing those rolls in my back forming and thought \"what the hell is this??\".\n\nIts actually really difficult going from skinny to overweight since I feel like I a sense of body dismorphia - I still see myself as skinny. Certain clothing styles that used to look good before... theres no way I could wear them now. Or sometimes i'll pick the wrong size thinking i'm still that size. The size thing is really difficult as in trying to get my brain wrapped around that i'm not longer that size anymore. I was a small-medium and now a large-XL so its hard to reprogram my brain that thats my size now. Pants are hard too, going from about a size 6-8 to now a size 14-16, my size always was available and now I can hardly ever find my size. Its also werid seeing those clothes where before i'd look at an XL and think \"oh shit thats huge\" and I look at it now and think \"wow thats actually pretty small\". I have no idea how ladies who are larger sizes do it, I feel like an XL isn't even particularly that big and even when the L-XL doesn't fit its incredibly discouraging.\n\nAfter months of not going to the gym, this month I re-signed up for a gym membership. Right now i'm only able to go 1-2x a week. But next month i'll be able to go more due to some life things settling down. I want to get back to my weight pre-covid.",

This is usually with pushing or pulling my 4.5 year old twins in the wagon. This is too much for the dog too, so sometimes the dog is in there too, along with the shopping etc. That sht gets proper heavy.\n\nI feel so much better. I mean this is unplanned and unwanted work out. But clearly needed. We both had to get new shoes, proper insoles, knee support etc. But once we adjusted to the amount of walking, it did make a difference in both me and my husbands endurance. \n\nRecently my husband bought a bike. We will buy a car soon too, but right now I am kinda proud of being able to walk these distances while pulling weight and not be out of breath anymore. I kinda dont want to get a car anymore, just because I know that'll make us lazier again.\n\nI'd just be happy when we can buy a washing machine so I don't have to lug the laundry of a 4 people family around anymore. That is way too much. But as it is, I think I am in peak condition for someone who has zero intention of working out. It's only downhill for me from here on out.",
