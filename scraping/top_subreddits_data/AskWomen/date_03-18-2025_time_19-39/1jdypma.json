And by pizza, I mean the kind with extra cheese that instantly clogs your arteries but you eat it anyway 'cause hey, we only live once, right? Shopping\u2019s kinda like that\u2014it\u2019s this crazy rush of dopamine, but then you check your bank account and it\u2019s like waking up from a dream where you were a millionaire. I just love wandering around stores, filling up a cart with a bunch of stuff I might never use. It\u2019s the thrill of hunting for a bargain and the sweet victory of finding a shirt that actually fits without cutting off your circulation. And don\u2019t get me started on retail therapy! Buying stuff you don\u2019t need with money you don\u2019t have\u2014now that's the American Dream, baby!",

            "body": "I come from lower middle class where my family was fine, but not much room in the budget for other than the necessities. When I would ask my mom to buy me something I wanted, the answer was often no. I understood why and didn\u2019t fight her on it, but it still sucked. Fast forward to being an adult with money, shopping is an achievement for me because I don\u2019t tell myself no. However, sometimes it\u2019s an internal struggle to say no when I should.",
