The more you avoid it the harder it'll be to deal with, and instead of healing it'll just kind of get worse and worse in my experience. \n\nAt the same time, don't beat yourself up excessively. We fuck up. Sometimes we fuck up really bad. Some people fuck up worse than others, and if you're unlucky you may end up making a mistake so major that nobody around you has ever experienced something similar. Accept that. \n\nRegardless of the relative \"badness\" of your mistake, the reality is that it happened and it cannot un-happen. While this sucks, it also means you cannot waste time wishing it didn't happen (although I've definitely been there).\n\nAcknowledge it. \nDo what you can.\nTime helps.",

A lot of the choices we make that end up being wrong are usually due to not having all the information, or learning the full picture AFTER we make the decision. Its really easy to think \"wow, I can't believe I did that... how horrible am I?\" when you have all the information...that didn't exist when a choice had to be made.\n\nMistakes happen; its what makes us human.",
