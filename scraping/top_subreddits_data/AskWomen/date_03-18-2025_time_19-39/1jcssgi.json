            "body": "Why tai lung in kung fu panda is considered the villain when shifu and oogway inflated his ego and guaranteed him without a shadow of a doubt that he would be the dragon warrior only for at the last minute to have it taken from him?\n\nTo elaborate\u2026\n\nTai Lung is a characterization of the weight of expectation. He was Shifu\u2019s prized student with the strength, skill, speed, and raw talent needed to inherit the dragon scroll. Which was rightfully his since his whole life was dedicated to, and even encouraged to earning it. Then some asshole tortoise tells him he\u2019s a little angry since Shifu used him as a catalyst for his own ambitions despite Oogway also living in the temple during all of Tai Lungs life, training, and spare time where he could\u2019ve dropped in at any time to balance his aggression. But noooooo, this bowl on legs decides like 2 1/2 decades later after Tai Lung is a man set in his ways to tell him he done fucked up. \n\nSo Tai Lung, rightfully, has some rage built up. He took it out on the local village, wrongfully, but still understandable, and Oogway has the audacity to put him down after being a silent objector for 25ish years. Then, after Tai Lung escapes prison he rushes back to retrieve the scroll. He doesn\u2019t kill and rampage until the furious five confront him at the rope bridge where he wipes the floor with all five who were considered to be dragon warrior material, further proving he was more than worthy which justified his lifelong compulsion to earning it. By beating the 5 runners up at once further proved his rightful claim to it. \n\nWhen he fights Shifu he has that line where he\u2019s throwing a flurry of punches and says \u201care you proud now? Tell me how proud you are\u201d and Shifu confesses he was always proud which catches TL off guard because that was all he ever wanted. Approval. Approval and to be seen as worthy from his father figure. Shifu and Oogway are the reason for TL emotional shortcomings and pent up aggression. \n\nHis whole life he was forged into a weapon, but he obviously didn\u2019t get a lot of hugs along the way or was told he did a good job. Cause and effect. He was put on a pedestal and made to believe from adolescence that he absolutely positively would become the dragon warrior and was never told otherwise so his arrogance became the fuze to the time bomb that was the expectations cast upon him his entire life. It\u2019s tragic and Tai Lung was too talented to be cast aside like he was. His anger is warranted and was directed at the right people after his prison escape. 5 watered down versions of him got the business, his mentor, and Oogway\u2019s weak ass would\u2019ve got that werk too had he not bailed out like a coward early on in the movie. The only reason he lost is because the plot deemed it necessary since it\u2019s a kids movie and we\u2019re made to believe we\u2019re all special or whatever. \n\nThank you for your time.",

I\u2019ll go based off some of my 2024 reads since those are the freshest for me: \n- I never see anyone talk about The Wall by Marlen Haushofer but it is such a good book that I thought about all year! I loved it because it\u2019s about a woman vacationing at a hunting lodge in Austria when, seemingly out of nowhere, an invisible wall appears separating her from the rest of the world. Everyone and everything on the other side appears to have died. It was so beautifully written and just about a woman trying to navigate her new reality with little survival skills and some luck. \n- Chain-Gang All-Stars by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah. It\u2019s a future America in which inmates in the prison system fight to the death in a gladiator style arena to earn their freedom. It\u2019s necessary because it has footnotes detailing actual realities of prisoners in America and it makes you really think about incarceration and the penal system. \n- One Dark Window and Two Twisted Crowns (The Shepherd King duology) by Rachel Gillig. Those two books are my #1 books for 2024 and the best fantasy series I\u2019ve read in a while! So well done! So creative!",

I remember for a few books I've read, the main characters made some questionable decisions.\n\nI get that this would probably require a lot of explanation..... Don't necessarily want a whole book report and ideally this could be a decision early enough in the plot to not run the book too much cause I might read those two books.",

I love the premise and I think it includes a lot of important themes like racism in and out of the penal system, the damage private prisons are capable of, and the inhumanity that comes with late-stage capitalism. But I have to say this book is a slog. It's taken me a month to get halfway, where usually I can read 3 books in a week. It's so disjointed, there are too many POVs, and the way some things are written makes it difficult to understand. I keep feeling like... *just get on with it and tell the damn story* lmao.\n\nAnd I'm just here also to say that The Shepherd King was the best duology I've read. The magic system was so interesting and different. It was stunning, I loved it. \n\nHave you read Don't Let The Forest In by C.G. Drews? I tell everyone to read this. It's a little spooky YA LGBTQIA+ horror with such stunning, poetic prose. It will devastate you in the best way.",

Since they think I'm not lonely, better seize the time to laser focus and make my fortress while they're busy not thinking about me. Not that I'm *so* important to think of, but the gist is that whenever I can move in silence, I move in silence. \n\nI also have streaks of loneliness and frustration when my then close \"friend group\" just wouldn't get me. A friend gets a high grade on an exam, she's vehemently amazing (I mean, why not? It's honest work as well). I make a sale in my business, suddenly I'm overwhelming myself and making a poor decision and shouldn't really go after certain things (huh?). But if any, I've learned to look within. Remind myself to not seek validation from people who don't see my worth. \n\nWhether or not they're bad friends---I refuse to label. I just believe that their level of friendship doesn't match what I'm willing to give, and that's okay. Because their incapacity doesn't automatically translate to what's my own incapacity per se. \n\nI've always been a believer that so as long as people like you and me keep pushing, we'd eventually find ourselves in the route towards people who understand us. The ones who would not require us to translate our souls, because they speak our language, with the eloquence and symphony and ensemble of words that thrill and nurture the spirit simultaneously. \n\nLife can be challenging, and sometimes more than what we believe could take . . . but life being challenging doesn't make you any less of a conqueror <3",
