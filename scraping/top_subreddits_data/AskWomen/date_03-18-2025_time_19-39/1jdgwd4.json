I trashed every relationship I had even though it broke my heart and I hated myself for it. You can love someone and still ruin their lives by choosing drugs or alcohol over them. The drugs don\u2019t allow you the luxury of having happy relationships. Best thing you can do for yourself and for them is to get out of the relationship. If they get clean then wait at least a year before you revisit it if you still want to.",

The day I found him for the 5th time somehow was finally enough for me to leave. He was on a ventilator for 3 days and when he woke up we both looked at each and other and just knew it was time for us to part ways. I helped move him into sober living and loved him from afar.

For me, I used to cope with their manipulation, cheating, control, physical abuse and my own trauma as a child. It is very possible that a person can change but its very rare. Most of the time its something a person needs to discover for themselves. Alone.\n\nBut at the same time an addict want someone to love them unconditionally which is a two edged sword. Sometimes that person just isn't enough to make them happy enough to overcome it.\n\nLoving an addict can be impossible, but not completely. Ever case is different and in mine, I'm getting closer everyday I don't use to be worthy of someone's love. I never want to see that disappointment in their eyes again.",
