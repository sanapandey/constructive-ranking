You see an older body and older habits of an older man that you see as disgusting until you grow up with someone your age and get older yourself. Also to think of having kids young with someone who would die so much sooner, ugh. My current bf is only 2 years older than me at 30 and to imagine him dating an 18 year old seems super predatory. It\u2019s also a blessing to grow up with someone who you share similarities with because of the lack of age gap. You feel more connected and referencing shows you watched as a kid is a bittersweet nostalgia you can\u2019t share with someone who grew up 2 decades before you.",

On the plus side, he was super mature and established, which meant no games or drama, and he had all these life experiences that made conversations really interesting. We went to cool places I might not have found by myself, and the way he saw the world was kinda inspiring. \n\nBut there were challenges too. Sometimes, our energy levels and interests were way off. While I was all about trying new trendy places and staying out late, he was more into low-key nights. Also, some of his friends and family didn't get it, and, to be honest, some of mine didn't either. We were from totally different generations, so there were those cultural gaps that popped up every once in a while.\n\nOverall, I learned a lot about myself and what I wanted in a relationship from the whole experience. It's definitely not for everyone, but it was a memorable time. Now I'm kinda thinking if he actually sent me an email when we broke up because I don't know if an actual text message was within his vocabulary at that time...",

Sometimes just play board games, get dinner, or have deep conversations. It isn\u2019t transactional, but he does take care of me when we go out, not that I expect it. There\u2019s a very gentle, loving side from him that I have never seen from a man my age. He tells me I bring out so much energy and life. It\u2019s interesting because I\u2019m very spunky and goofy, and despite the age gap, it meshes well. He makes me feel at peace and wanted.

I ended up moving away but we are still on good terms. Maturity is a choice. Just as staying young at heart is a choice. The age gap coupled with us both being aware this was a transition stage for me made us both appreciate the present. I\u2019ve since dated other older men (mid 50s) but have dialed it back because I noticed they were planning much further in the future than I was comfortable with and I didn\u2019t want to string them along.

Some had severe issues (addiction, mental health etc), some just grew apart over time, the kinds of things that can end any relationship.  \n\nThis isn't to say that age is never a factor in healthy relationships, mind you. There are absolutely older men who will target and manipulate young women. But it's also entirely possible to have a normal relationship that just happens to have a large age gap. In my case, all of my past partners (and my current one) were earning similar amounts of money to me, and living in similar situations (renting, no children etc), so the oft-cited power imbalance concerns have never really come up for us.",

Nobody's perfect, but the effort is definitely there. \n- He balances financial security and spending on things that makes us happy very well. I don't have to worry about him spending too much or saving so much that he doesn't want to treat me or go on dates. He's an adult who's been divorced and understands his financial needs.\n\nHe had 2 kids in his previous marriage, and the youngest (21) lives with us. We get along great despite people thinking it would be awkward due to the small gap. I never wanted kids of my own, so having a partner willing to get a vasectomy so I could get off birth control was a  great bonus!",

Our marriage didn't end happily ever after, but he was the love of my life all the same. He was someone I happily made love to every single day, and he satisified me every time. I spent 10 years of my life with him, but sadly, we went our separate ways.  Mostly because we didn't 'grow' together I guess.\n\nI'd be interested to hear about women who've dated much younger men, ie 20 yrs+.  One of my exes was still very much in love with a woman 15+ys older.",

There are definitely some generational differences, but we were (and are) eager to learn about the other\u2019s experiences, so we remain interesting to each other. There have been some tough times for sure, but overall, I don\u2019t regret it, and we are still very much in love.\n\nWe are both tattoo artists and introverts, we both like to ride, and we both enjoy gaming. We go out on dates together pretty regularly. We do spend time with friends and family, but like I said, we are both introverts so parallel time is bonding time for us, and we prioritize that. We have very similar tastes in decor, furniture, etc. We have the same religious beliefs (both of us are Hellenic pagans).\n\nHe\u2019s my person and my safe space, no one in my life has ever loved me the way he does, so when he reaches the age where he\u2019s decrepit, I\u2019ll be there to take care of him. He has taken care of me at my worst points, and his family has been better to me than my own.",

He is an amazing man and we lasted 7 years plus an engagement . I changed my mind about wanting kids and he rightfully said that door was closed for him and we broke up . People deff figured I was a gold digger , we often especially at the beginning for I started to age a bit more were confused if I was a daughter or a hooker . He was in great shape and could run circles around me . Our friend groups never co mingled. After some clarity and the break up I deff realized my friends were only supporting it for me although they liked him enough they didn\u2019t necessarily wanna hang out with him especially in our early and mid 20s . Also there were co dependency issues and I got really used to be taken care of all the time and I deff lost some of my autonomy but that was both of our types of personalities. He was also very principales and prob \u201csaved me\u201d from a very destructive party path but I kinda just wish I spent more time dating and partying in moderation but that could be any relationship .",

But I don\u2019t think a lot of girls have the strong boundaries and ability to advocate for themselves to be able to date older men so I never recommend it.\n\nI feel like if you are a girl who knows she\u2019s hot and knows how to seduce men and knows that she is the prize then dating an older man isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. \nBut there are a lot of creepy, older dudes who are looking for young na\u00efve girls. \n\nMy experiences have been positive because they pay for everything. Like my dog had a really expensive vet bill and I started crying about it and it just got paid instantly. Or one time I was sad about something and the guy just gave me like $1000. And I kept crying because I was obviously still upset because money didn\u2019t fix that situation. So he sent me another thousand dollars. So my tears earned me two grand \n\nI like that they tend to be more cultured and have more experience. So when you travel with them, which you have to take a lot of safety precautions obviously but it\u2019s nice to go to Europe with someone who has been to Europe a bunch of times because they get excited to show you things. \n\nIf you are trying to level up at work or start your own business, they tend to be able to guide you in that direction as well as finance it. They would rather give you money to help you start your business venture then for you to pick up a second job \n\nSo it makes it easier to progress towards your goals while dating. \n\nBut if you\u2019re dating an older guy and he\u2019s not paying for everything. And I mean everything. I mean everything no matter how much it cost then there is no point in dating him. We live in a patriarchal society that was literally made for men. And if he\u2019s 20 years older than you, he should definitely have the money to be able to to give you whatever you want. Because if not, you might as well date, a young guy.\n\n\nAnd don\u2019t get me wrong you can definitely find a younger guy who is willing to pay for everything as well. But I find that if you\u2019re not ready for marriage or serious relationship dating a younger provider, man can be a little bit more complicated because they are usually ready to settle down.",

So many older men, such as the guy who commented below are absolute predators. They are looking for young na\u00efve girls to scam. They are looking for girls who don\u2019t have boundaries.\n\n\nI don\u2019t think girls should be going on dates to develop boundaries. Those boundaries should be ironclad set in stone before you ever start interacting with a man. We get those boundaries from our fathers. And from the strong father figures in our lives. We get those boundaries from our mothers who were treated well by our fathers. And if not, those boundaries need to be modeled after people of strong, moral fiber. \n\nTelling a girl to date an older man to develop boundaries is leading a lamb to the slaughter. This is awful advice. Are you a man? Is that why you\u2019re saying that? Because it probably benefits you to put that false narrative out there. Because you think someone is gonna click on your profile and think that you\u2019re a genuinely good guy? Because that makes you really weird. Weird and na\u00efve.",
