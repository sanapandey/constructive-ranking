Having simple Whole Foods that are nutritional dense that are pretty much the same.\n\nOr using one of those meal delivery services. \n\nEither method will help you cut down on time. Not just from the cooking, but also from the cleaning and having to grocery shop constantly. \n\nWearing the same clothes. Like how Steve Jobs had basically the same black turtleneck over and over. \n\nLearning to automate. Maybe you can\u2019t do it every day but maybe you can once a month have a cleaner come over.\n\nGetting rid of social media. I am not verifying social media. I\u2019m just saying you don\u2019t need TV and you don\u2019t need social media. There\u2019s only enough hours in the day to get so much done. So that\u2019s usually the easiest place to cut the fat.\n\n\nSetting a timer on your washer. So you put the clothes in there and put the detergent in there and then set it so that it starts running and stops right when you wake up so you can just toss them in the dryer. \n\nAlso, this is a crazy tip, but that one girl named Pearl who loves red pill guys. Anyway, pearl has nine other siblings. And her mom has an Instagram that\u2019s based around organization. I don\u2019t know how pearl is related to that woman. But that woman\u2019s paid on organization is in tiptop shape. She has managed to run a household with 10 children and she does not have a hair out of place or a single crumb on the floor.

Get morning stuff out the night before eg. clothes, cereal etc.  \n\\-Keep a running to-do list handy eg. in your phone. Whenevber I worry I've forgotten something, I just check the list.  \n\\- Stop ironing. Huge waste of time imo. I just don't wear clothes that show creases eg. button-up shirts. You can steam your clothes by hanging them up in the bathroom while you shower  \n\\- Get a dishwasher. I've got a half-size one, or you can get countertop ones that plug into your kitchen tap. I HATE washing dishes so this was essential for me.  \n\\- Get a big pack of the same socks. Now pairing socks is easy! I have 20 pairs of socks with little aliens on them so I know they're mine.  \nPlease add to this list!",

To combat this, and really to completely solve it for myself, was making it *easy* to do everyday things. Adding filters to my inbox, creating small checklists, building a healthy routine, preparing my car for easy in/easy out.  Since I have kids now, I can go from \u201cI need to leave to do something\u201d to \u201cI\u2019m ready and out the door\u201d in 15 minutes.  I can prepare a to do list that satiates my need to prioritize and accomplish a lot in little time.  It does take time and focus to do this\u2026but it makes taking the \u201coops, I forgot something\u201d or \u201coops, this is more complicated than I imagined\u201d in stride soooo much easier. When things come up, it doesn\u2019t feel like \u201cthis is wrong AND I wasn\u2019t prepared AND I forgot something\u201d it changes to \u201clet\u2019s solve this little problem that I know I can easily accomplish.\u201d\n\nThe upside to all that time and focus was I now feel **a lot** less mentally tired, even when I\u2019m physically tired.  I now have more time to myself to practice self care, self love, and reflection. I have time to put into stress reduction further, since I can add gym time, relaxation, and me time regularly into most of my days.  The days where I can\u2019t or don\u2019t have the bandwidth are more rare and I\u2019m able to identify when I need to be kinder, or show some gratitude to myself.",
