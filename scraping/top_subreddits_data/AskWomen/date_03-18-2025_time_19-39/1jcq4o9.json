The men that have said something are blunt with their thoughts. The women are malicious and attempt to tear me down and make me feel bad. The comments from women are far more plentiful and way worse. \n\nThe men tell me that I would look better with more weight, as if I can control my natural metabolism? I'm sure they're implying if my boobs and butt were the only things bigger. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 but I actually unintentionally lose weight when I eat healthy and exercise. I have to eat loads of carbs to maintain. Idk. Doctor says i have no metabolism or thyroid issues. \n\nThe women who comment on my body are possibly insecure of themselves. Bc why else would anybody say anything negative or cast an underhanded comment about someone's body? They make comments that are directed to me about themselves. Comments such as \"I wish I was that skinny,\" \"must be nice to be thin,\" and \"you can eat whatever you want\". Those are just the least mean ones I've received. I'm sure it's not to make me feel bad. But the implication feels present and as if they're trying to put their problems onto me. It's really annoying for me and I do empathize. But everyone is fighting their own battles, and no one needs extra shit from anybody.",

I used to be thin but puberty and adulthood happened so I became overweight despite the regular exercise. As much as I would want to deflect the insults, I just lost the energy to even mind their comments on how big my arms, hips, and legs are. Thanks to them I find it difficult to buy new clothes for myself.",

So I don't care. But it hurts when I hear them talk to each other saying unfit women are gross.\n\nWomen on the other hand are like Mean Girls. Their words and actions I can ignore.\n\nI used to get it mostly from women, but now from men.",
