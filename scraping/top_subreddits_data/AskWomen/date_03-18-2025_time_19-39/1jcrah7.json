I changed my flight to leave the day after this fateful one as I just wanted to be home at that point. Whether it was the sickness or not, I was over Portugal and didn\u2019t feel connected to it. \n\nOn my last day, I matched with a guy on Bumble. Probably the hottest man I\u2019ve ever seen. A model, real Jason Mamoa type. I expected nothing to happen like 99% of matches but he was insistent on seeing me before I left. I explained that I was sick and just interested in getting home the next day. \n\nHe ended up finding me not one but two of the medications that I needed, driving over to my hotel and dropping them off to me. The second I saw him in person (hotter than the photos), I knew I had to have one last fun night on the trip. \n\nI said \u201cfuck it, let\u2019s go get drinks it\u2019s my last night\u201d. We went to a little dive bar in Porto where we shared life stories. Showed each other music that moved us. Talked about growing up and why we are the way we are. \n\nHe dropped me back to my hotel but I just thought, this can\u2019t be it. I invited him to spend the night with me and it was some of the best sex I have ever had. We were up much of the night enjoying one another. \n\nThe next day we got up, he headed off to work and me to the airport to get back home. I know I\u2019ll probably never see him again, but I will also never forget him or his kindness (okay fine, the sex too) and how remarkable it was to take a chance that last night.",

Right away the first time we got intimate he completely shattered my naive world by placing his thumb gently on my butthole and massaging me there softly while we were making out. It felt so different and unfamiliar, yet sooo good. Each time we met in the following days, he would introduce me to a new form of anal play. It started with fingering, then licking, then lubing and massaging and finally penetrative sex. Every single time he would take such care of me, like he'd get a real kick out of it and make me orgasm so intensely, like no one else before and no one ever since. It was heaven.\n\n\nSadly, he had to leave the country and return back to his home after a couple of months. It's been almost 10 years and I haven't seen him since. But I will never forget him.",

A man made eye contact and smiled a few times later in the evening and finally came over to say hello but it was too late to ask for a dance. He was staying at the hotel where the wedding was, but my coworker and I were staying elsewhere. He wanted to continue getting to know each other, so he offered to pay for a cab to bring me back.\n\nI came back and we walked the halls of the historic hotel talking about anything and everything. We ended up back in the ballroom where the reception was, but all the tables were put away and it was quiet. He asked me what song I wanted to dance to and played the Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong version of \u201cDancing Cheek to Cheek\u201d on his phone and we shared a private, romantic dance in the empty ballroom.\n\nWe went to his room and messed around, but didn\u2019t want to sleep together when we may not see each other again. So we stopped and went back to exploring the hotel. He accompanied me in the cab back to my hotel around 4am.\n\nHe wanted to keep in touch and see each other again, but he lived a couple states away and I stopped talking to him when he suggested that I quit my job and move in with him. I was far from interested in being someone\u2019s dependent and removed from my support network of friends and family.\n\nEither way, I can look back on that night and remember it like something that would happen in a movie and then remember that\u2019s not real life.",

We\u2019d spend hours listening to music and massaging each other, ending in mind blowing, crazy-connected sex. I broke up with him bc I was stuck in a small town and neither of us was going anywhere - I had a sudden realization that if we kept on I would get pregnant and we\u2019d build a life in this tiny town and my dreams would be over. I moved away and he followed, got into drugs, then joined the military. I got married to the first man who looked at me kindly, spent the next 20 years chasing my own tail in a codependent spiral. He got married and had a couple of kids. Both of our lives turned out pretty good, honestly. \n\nA few months ago we reconnected on socials and the depth of the connection, emotionally and physically, is still absolutely there. We tried to make it work but it fell apart due to circumstances that aren\u2019t changeable right now. I\u2019m honestly still pretty fucked up about it - I spent 20 years fantasizing about him and I thought we might have a chance again to explore what was there. I hope there\u2019s time in the future, but it\u2019s all unknown and we live across the country from each other \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I\u2019ve never vibed with someone like that before. Our banter was off the charts and we bullied each other playfully. There\u2019s nothing I could say that would offend him and he didn\u2019t bother about offending me too. He was overly worried about his life\u2019s trajectory and what people thought of him because he was different - I thought he was everything and more. He was smart, playful, serious, engaging, fun, blunt, humorous - those types of jokes and  banter that are implied and  masked. He didn\u2019t want a relationship with me and I understood that. He was really the best bed partner I\u2019ve ever had in one month, as opposed to my other years-long relationships. I think of him often. Each man that talks to me is unintentionally measured against him - they all fall short. We had many inside jokes which I miss very dearly. I see him often and wish we wouldn\u2019t ignore each other so much but that\u2019s that. I was not a touch type love language person before him and never imagined hugging people or kissing people\u2019s cheeks. There was something about the way he let me wear his clothes and held me while we slept and kissed my face and shoulders that made me feel so complete - like all my broken pieces were put back together and I found myself instinctively kissing his face and touching him which was something I never used to do. I think he healed a part of me that felt shame from that. He\u2019ll always be an important part of my life.",

Conversation seemed too good to be true and her profile pictures didn\u2019t reveal much in the way of looks so I thought once we met in person she would be less attractive. WRONG. She was smoking hot and incredibly well-spoken. Turns out she went to an Ivy League college but was also super \u201chippy\u201d mindset. All about sustainability and environmentally conscious (not something I really cared about but still honorable). Hooked up that night and had the best sex I\u2019d had up to that point in my life. I went home the next day and thought \u201cthat was too good to be true, bet she\u2019s gonna ghost me\u2026\u201d not the case! She hit me up a few hours later wanting to make plans for that evening. Fast forward 2 and a half months, we\u2019re hanging out at least every other day, feelings develop and then BAM! The West Coast went up in flames. We lived in the city so we were safe from fires but the smoke was so bad that most people were staying indoors. Basically we didn\u2019t see each other for 3 weeks, conversation became less and less, and I finally decided to check in with her to see where \u201cwe\u201d stood. She essentially said she took my absence as being disinterested and decided to move on. I was bummed, but it was also the end of summer and we had very early on defined things as \u201cnothing serious/NSA\u201d so I think it just ran its course. Never had luck like that with dating apps and once I decided to get back out there I abandoned dating apps entirely and chose to meet someone organically; Nothing could ever match or top that experience so there was no point in trying.",

He lived 20 minutes from where I\ufe0f was, for some reason I\ufe0f thought he lived in Naples and had to drive 2 hours? Anyways, he owns his own winery! The little town I\ufe0f was in did not have a good nightlife so we ended up sitting in his car, drinking his wine and just talking about our love for traveling and all the place we\u2019ve been and want to go and exchanging little cultural difference between Italians, Americans and since I\u2019m Honduran, Latin American as well. We even mimicked Northern and southern accents from our own countries hehe, it was funny.

His Italian accent in my ear was *muah* chef\u2019s kiss! Which is ironic because I\ufe0f listened to a Quibi audio of an Italian guy a few months before that so\u2026manifesting? \n\nAfter the high of the date my host parents pretty much got on me abt dating in Italy and blah blah blah, they strongly discouraged me seeing him again (I\ufe0f was not gonna do that) and we had plans to see each other again but he went on a ski trip while I\ufe0f was losing my MIND in that house and I\ufe0f ended up just leaving abruptly (I\ufe0f snuck out the house at 4 AM to head to the train station to be more specific). Texted him that I\ufe0f was going home and that I\ufe0f wished we had more time because he was the best part of my trip. \n\nWe absolutely still text and are trying to plan to meet up so wish me luck y\u2019all. \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\ude77",

Finally, I was going to experience what it was like to be crazy about someone and them feeling the same way about me AND it being allowed to evolve into something - anything. He came back to my place and we made out on my couch. He did suggest taking it a step further, but for me, going from the lack of experience I\u2019d had - to sex - with someone I\u2019d just admitted feelings to on the same day, was just a bit too fast for me, so I declined. But I couldn\u2019t wait to explore it soon. I was just so, so happy.\n\nHe broke up with me the next day he saw me. So we were officially dating for a total of 72 hours. Back at work, he proceeded to treat me like I was a bad smell, for months. Barely even able to look at me. Soo, thats the most memorable \u2018fling\u2019 I\u2019ve had and to this date (3 years later) still the closest I\u2019ve ever gotten to anything in terms of non-platonic relationships.",

I don\u2019t know which one is the most unforgettable to me since both guys have left me valuable lessons about relationships. \n\nThe first guy used to be my fwb for one year. We were on and off, while I had other flings too. Gradually, he developed feelings for me first, and I was cautious because I wasn\u2019t ready for anything serious after my long history of abuse. He was determined to gain my trust and build up mutual feelings with me. I finally stepped into a relationship with him because I realized his feelings were genuine and he did care about me. Honestly, he\u2019s the first man ever to see me for who I am, not a sexual object. I had been feeling like an object for so long given the fact that I was groomed and raped many times before. The relationship lasted for about 8 months. What\u2019s surprising about this relationship is that we never had sex when we were girlfriend and boyfriend even though we had been friends with benefits before. This is because I told him about my past and said I didn\u2019t wanna engage in any sexual activities because I was in a hyposexual phase. He was very supportive, and we went 8 months without any sex. I broke up with him for a few reasons not related to my sexual trauma. Until now, he\u2019s the only ex who I can still think fondly of.\n\nThe second unforgettable fling was never an actual fling because he realized that a fling at that time would push me deeper into my depression. I acted out by asking him to harm me like my attackers did, which was so unreasonable. He immediately refused my offer and became angry because I asked him to harm me. He\u2019s unlike other men who often see me as something sexual. We developed feelings for each other over the course of time, but we never ended up together because it wasn\u2019t the right time. We agreed to end things between us, and that broke me terribly.",

Our relationship started as long distance, and then he came home for 2 weeks before leaving on deployment to Japan. Those two weeks we were love drunk. When he moved away, things fell apart over a couple months and we ended up splitting. When he returned home about a year later, we met up. In the evening we walked into a hotel, and he booked us a night; I was swooning. The sexual tension was palpable heading up to our room. The emotions and body chemistry were overwhelming. It was like a movie. As the door shuts we were already on the bed and I'm sitting on top of him; he pulls my top off. You can imagine what ensued. It was so much passion. Things didn't work out for us in the long run. It's okay because he had a small \ud83c\udf46 and accused me of cheating on him.",

Matched with a German on bumble, he was working on a farm about 45mins north of me. We met for drinks, went back to the farm, had great sex. Met a few more times, had sex by the billabong on the farm, went swimming in the Murray, our dogs would run around having a great time. He moved interstate and things naturally fizzled out. Until one day he messaged me, we organised a trip, by the coast, all I had to do was pay for my flights and lots of great sex again. I stopped talking to him cause our personalities and world views were polar opposites and I knew it had run its course.",

As in a real movie, not a porn. Something I've never done in my life and I'm sure will never have the chance to do again. I have not verbally told one living soul about it and doubt I ever will.\n\nWithin 24 hours after it happened I sat down, opened my laptop, created a fake Reddit account and wrote every-single-detail down about it. I revised the text many times over a handful of hours to make sure I didn't leave a single sensation / emotion / thought out. \n\nIt reads like a chapter in book where the story is so good you just can't wait to turn the page and read more. I remember just before I created the post how made up it sounded. I titled it something very memorable so I could revisit it anytime here on Reddit, but after I posted it... I never looked at it again.",
