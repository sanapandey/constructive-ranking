People who struggle with religious psychosis tend to have an urgency and are really obsessed with looking for meaning and writing often worrisome things like this. At first we thought he just was sober and trying to heal but there was this anger and strange messaging in his posts just like this. He even started speaking to people in very weird ways totally unlike himself. I posted a video of a band I like and he viewed it then sent a very nasty message about how as a follower of their music I\u2019d be going to hell and that all sounds should be music for the lord only.

            "body": "I was in gifted education and fine until a few traumatic brain injuries and people slipping me drugs out of spite. I'm part Latino and in my small town, Oroville, people didn't like, some of them, a minority being smarter than them, and when I went to Rick's College in Idaho, now named BYU Idaho, just as bad. The only thing Idaho exports is Nazis and potatoes as a Utah radio DJ once joked. But, the TBI did bring more than memory problems. I had to go through speech therapy, cognitive therapy and memory therapy too but I also developed schizophrenia. A TBI per an article I found a few years ago increases your chance of such a mental illness by up to 400%. You can also develop deep depression and bipolar etc. I still have memory issues but I've written stuff kinda sorta like that while off meds but it made more sense. I was just ummm very irritated. Lol I made some scientist friends with my ideas, kinda like Doc on Back to the future getting an idea for the flux capacitor. It's not like I'm a scientist, and my ideas are very basic, am no engineer but I've had enough TBIs to be declared legally dead and I'm still going somehow. I recently presented some ideas to my brother on something for the military he literally says \"damn bro, you're like lex Luther\" ugh lol I hated that comparison. I'll have to add he's not a techie or scientist. He was 101st Airborne and works at a local military base like I did in 2008. I got a letter of recommendation before I left for IT for better pay. However I'm on meds, I'm not delusional. I KNOW there's people way smarter than me but my dream was to be a scientist as a child. I grew up an Air Force brat and many in my family were military. I grew up on Tom Clancy, war movies and other military novels as well. I hung out in the recruiting station in high school reading Leatherneck Magazine. Got approached by recruiters before my TBI and got in the high 90s, I'm told, on my ASVAB. I tried pushing some of my ideas on Research Gate and had made friends there before, and I'm interested in Transhumanism. I was gifted a hardback book from Ray Kurzweil's publisher with his autograph and a laptop sticker and I suppose if I was delusional I'd think it was directly from him and that he \"admired my work.\" Lol there's a thing called citizen science and I still have some smarts in spite of as many concussions as a quarterback facing Lyle Alzado. I have my associates, CompTIA A+,  MCSE, and two cyber security certs. People invited me to defcon twice but I spent my money on food instead. I know, kinda ummm aloof. They got upset because at the time they were friends. I used to install Gentoo Linux exclusively after trying out some other distros and it doesn't make me a genius but in California I was in G.A.T.E. so I was above average. It's the Gifted And Talented Education program and I honestly feel like I wasted my smarts on techie stuff. I wish I'd become an engineer but I was born in the 70s. At least in a small 5k population town, breaking into engineering seemed impossible as a minority and even in Utah, the county mental health system that was used to dealing with repeat offenders, homeless and druggies and still need armed guards, I fell between the cracks. So I switched providers finally and I'm on really good needs. Word of advice. Avoid abilify like the plague. Just Google the unusual side effects and lawsuits. Oh and I have seizures as a result of my TBI. Was taken in an ambulance once and they give me Depakote for that. I'm taking lurasidone HCL, which works well. Warning though, take it at night when you're ready to go to sleep. I set my smartwatch to charge, took it, and fell asleep with my watch still charging. I wanted to measure my sleep lol but yeah, definitely get him help. I was homeless for a bit without needs. People. Target. You. Mentally ill people are targeted for violence and exploitation at a much above average amount compared to the sane people. They can't take care of themselves. I'm lucky, on the streets, the illegals looked after me because I'm Hispanic. And I ended up in jail twice because of my TBI, another potential danger. Oh YouTube look up \"TBI crime Ted talks\" and you'll see why. Lucky, again, twice I was in jail the homies looked after me. It's a Latino thing but jail is crime 101. They did try to recruit me, but the guards stepped in and I declared incompetent and went to mental health court. Quite a demotion from working for the military police as a civilian. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc Long story short, he can potentially end up dead even if only from self medicating with drugs or alcohol or both. Luckily, any mention of drugs or alcohol made me run like speedy Gonzales, my brain and LDS upbringing, plus reading medical encyclopedias on grade school and I knew what drugs can do even before getting to jr high. Or he, if he mixes drugs and alcohol, turn violent and get shot by police. I've seen YouTube video of that. Not all police are trained to deal with that. Plus usually schizo people have issues with the police. I don't, growing up on cop shows too helped. And in Utah they're sooooo helpful! Ohh edited, going off meds, at first I was fine. It was a \"high\" and you think you're fine. You're not. You progressively spiral out of control. You might get actual good ideas, only enforcing \"I'm fine\" but your brain suffers and gets damaged and especially on meds you have withdrawals. Just get second opinions and a good prescriber cuz some think they're God or give zero fucks/have compassion fatigue or something. And spiritual things can help as long as you don't go crazy with that. Exercise, being social, healthy hobbies like photography etc and be social. That helped me a $#1t ton! And choose the right friends. I had some convince me I only had a TBI and \"you can't get mental illness from that, they just wanna control you\" so I went off meds. \ud83d\udcaf Even a TBI needs psych meds a lot of the time even without an obvious mental illness to control anger or impulses (like flipping off my neurologist lol)",
