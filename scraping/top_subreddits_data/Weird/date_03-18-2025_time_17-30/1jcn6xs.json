It was probably dumped as a prank, but some say it was done to drive tourism",

I have to say, for the aspect you're talking about, it seems counterintuitive, but snorkelling is actually WAY scarier.   \n  \nWhen you're diving, because you're 'in' it, you can (usually) descend, to the floor, which feels like 'hiding', somehow. And, if you can't, I dunno, you just don't have that same sense of vulnerability of just 'sitting on top of the VAST GREAT BEYOND that you can't quite see', because you're 'in' it instead.   \n\n\nThere are obviously different fears though, you have to be aware of all your kit, and how to act and how to communicate with your dive partner and all that stuff, the whole 'not being able to breathe' part is kinda a big deal, but again, that sort of takes precedence in your brain so much there's less room to be worrying about the vastness and the unknown.   \n  \nOccasionally though you'll come across your mortal nemesis, the Squid, and freak out so much that you use tons of your air. I wouldn't recommend this.",

In the Cayman Islands we got dropped off a boat with a group of randos and were told that there was a intentionally sunken ship for divers nearby. I was already not having that much fun when I came up to the ship beneath me - it was a large steel vessel. It was SO far away, so deep below me, that I felt like I was falling out of the sky. I could see tiny dots that were divers exploring it. I was so shocked that I went underwater for a moment and had to flail back up. I swam over to our tour boat, held onto the ladder, and stayed there until the tour was over. Dang ocean, being all together too massive!",
