If your name isn't written in the Book of Life (aka, if you weren't a super good Christian), you get thrown into a big Lake of Fire where even Satan, Death, and the entirety of Hell are suffering for all eternity. If you were good, though, you get to live on New Earth in New Jerusalem, where God is walking around and chatting with everyone.\n\nYou can see how this is one of those \"Scary only from the inside\" sort of things. To someone fully indoctrinated, this shit preoccupies an unhealthy amount of their headspace at times. To anyone who's not, this is just the most boring scavenger hunt ever, because you have to read a bunch of quotes and then tack them together to understand what's being said.",
