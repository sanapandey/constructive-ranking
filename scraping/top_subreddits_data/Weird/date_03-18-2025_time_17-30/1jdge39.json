I read up on it, and apparently what is left of the cliff face, and even the cliff in general, is considered to be fairly fragile and brittle.  If they tried actually carving Trump's face into Mt Rushmore, it could collapse the cliff face.\n\nWhich I guess in its own way would be a pretty salient representation of the country.",

Turns tons of profits, way more profits than we turn today, just, hundreds of millions of billions of trillions of dollars in profits\u2014 and you know what he did? You know what that sick son of a bitch did? He *violated America\u2019s trust*! He was the trust buster, that was what they called him, because he was so untrustworthy.\u00a0\n\nAnd now, the Indian people\u2014 feathers, not dots, but I love both\u2014 the Indian people, they come to me, they say, \u201cdear Mr. Trump, we hate that face of Teddy Roosevelt on our mountain! It was a big, beautiful, wonderful mountain before his face went up there\u2014 won\u2019t you please remove Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s face and put yours there instead?\u201d They beg me. Daily and nightly, I get phone calls from the Seminole Indians, the university of Florida,\u00a0and the Chicago Blackhawks, all telling me that they agree that my face needs to go up there.\u00a0\n\nSo we\u2019re gonna do it! We\u2019re gonna make billions of jobs, Eric is gonna lead the initiative, I\u2019ve set aside 400 billion dollars that we freed up from the department of education to get construction started, and we\u2019re gonna erase Roosevelt\u2014 who by the way, almost lost us world war 2, he was so pathetic\u2014 we\u2019re gonna replace him, and we\u2019re gonna put my face up there.\u00a0\n\nEh? What\u2019s this. Oh\u2026. We\u2019re gonna put *Elon Musk\u2019s* face up there, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s Elon who\u2019s going up there now. And I\u2019ll just pave over Lincoln I guess.\u201d",

A nation that was a 'Mystery' in Biblical times. This last AC is 'boastful' and 'vile' and lawless; above the law. He always speaks 'great things' about himself, then even 'greater' and lies continually. He worships gold. He will apportion out the nations wealth and lands 'to a few' of his most loyal. \n\nHe was to make an accord between Israel and her neighbors and will confirm it by adding new nations. He holds power twice. He seemingly suffered a head wound that could have been mortal but wasn't, in a public place. \n\nHe will want to 'change the laws and the times'. \n\nHe threatens the King of the South and the King of the North and is looking to take over nations 'to the East' as well. \n\nHis partner/bff [is likened to a 'prophet'](https://www.democracydocket.com/opinion/the-false-prophet-of-government-efficiency/) who 'brings fire from the sky in the sight of men'- almost miraculously- never done before. He can also make a Mark (translated: etching) in peoples heads or hand, without which people cannot buy or sell using his new currency. He came to the world stage like a [Lamb, with two horns](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/NYPICHPDPICT000039751945.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024), but develops the voice of a [Dragon, which is his power.](https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/fc/3031641-inline-img8660.jpg) \n\nOne thing they have in common is that 'Frogs come forth from their mouths' - translated: 'speak' for them. KEK.\n\nAnd the current Christian Church sees the AC as akin to Jesus Christ returned. This is because God sent them a 'strong delusion' after they showed they love the lies and love the hate, 'so that they will be damned' along with the AC.\n\nAll of the above is scriptural- found in Daniel, 2 Thessalonians 2 and Revelations.",

Created by South Dakota artists Lee Leuning and Sherri Treeby, the statue took 34 days to complete and was privately funded at a cost of $1,100, with no taxpayer money involved. Noem arranged the funding through private donations, and there is no evidence that Trump commissioned or paid for the piece himself. The statue is now displayed at Mar-a-Lago, often seen in photos from Trump\u2019s office.\n\n---\n\nhttps://x.com/i/grok/share/lNxnquZEGaiNF86y9j3bGWrcU\n\n***",

They believe Trump ushers in the end and destruction of the world, because they're dumb and actually think it can end. So we're deeply, deeply screwed but it's because of \"mammon worship\", literally the worship of (loving and working for) Money, Power, and the world of that in general. \n\nAlso fun: Donald means King or King of this World. Trump means deception and exaggeration.\n\nDonald Trump = King Of Lies.\n\nAnd the people who worship him are the same ones who freak out over half time shows being satanic.

This is despite the fact that the golden calf would have been the prototype of the ark of the covenant, since it was understood that gods stood upon the backs of bulls. (Technically speaking, since the ark serves the same function as \u2018throne of god on earth,\u2019 it should be guilty of the same \u2018sin\u2019 as the calf.)\n\nThe whole snake aspect fell out of favor, but the propaganda story made to defame the south made it into the Torah, and later the Christian Old Testament.",

Other religions than theirs also viewed snakes as somewhat holy or straight up divine, and so they started to use snakes to symbolize foreign \u2018false gods.\u2019\n\nLater, when Christianity was starting to form and the sect was moving away from being a Hebrew only faith, those who opposed Judaism but supported Christianity started to subtlety apply attributes of Yhwh onto Lucifer/Satan. One has to remember that in Judaism, there are actually multiple Satans and not all of them are necessarily evil. Once early Church officials decided to focus on Satan as the enemy of the faith, a unifying evil presence to strive against, the more unsavory attributes of Yhwh were applied to him. Vain, demanding worship with pain of death, powers of light, darkness and wind (as Yhwh was both a war and fertility storm god) etc. This also explains why Satan is suddenly referred to as \u2018God of this world\u2019 and \u2018Prince of the air.\u2019\n\nEssentially, Satan being given the more \u2018negative\u2019 characteristics of Yhwh was literally Christianity demonizing Judaism by making its god the evil of their faith, while the \u2018true\u2019 god materialized through Jesus. Possible remnants of this shift exists through the Gnostics, until they were also declared heretics and purged/absorbed into the Church.",

You shall not bow down to them or worship them; For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.\"\n\nTo expand just a little bit further, one of the ten commandments, a commandment found in many if not all versions of the bible and the commandments, says \"THOU shalt have no other gods before me\" and yet further \"THOU shalt not make unto thee any graven image\" which deals with idolatry, or the strange worship of idols or images.\n\nThese false Christians worship Donald to the point of making what amounts to the Golden Calf. As it stands, it seems their false God has broken damn near every commandment on the list and should be seen as The Anti-Christ. We've all seen how he commits the cardinal sin of Lust, Gluttony, Pride and Greed.\n\nWe've seen how dangerous it can be, too, to follow and worship such a man. Murders and attempted murders being the tip of the iceburg with following such an evil person. To follow this person is dangerous, and to follow him blindly would jeopardize anyone and anything, from families to your core values. It wouldn't be such a far cry to eventually returning to the era of falsely accusing your neighbors and family of not being 'MAGA' enough, as it was during Nixon and the communist scare.\n\nAt what point will you all say this shit is enough?",

I am glad we can find commonality with Columbo!  Truce! I don't know how to stalk people like that on Reddit, but I'm glad you found our common ground.  I totally forgot about my Columbo game post. \n\nI think Nikki Haley would have followed MOST of Trump's policies, minus the tariffs and minus the arrogance.  I voted for her in the primary and cannot believe \"we\" nominated this dufus again. But I trust the process  in the VERY long term.   I don't think we could make money on the Columbo board game.  There are way too few of us fanatic fans left.   I will have to search my millions elsewhere.  Another idea I have:  Hotel chat.  PM for details.",
