There\u2019s a theory among historians that following a jousting competition when he was still relatively young -an activity that he was quite fond of and performed regularly- that resulted in Henry sustaining injuries that never properly healed contributed to his later radical changes. Among these injuries was a head injury, likely a concussion and a possible clot, and a wound on his thigh. Both were treated but given the medical limitations of the day did not result in full recovery. The leg injury became openly infected and never properly healed, no doubt leading to significant pain and mobility problems, and eventual weight gain. The guy already had an enormous ego and felt the need to swing it around, adding pain and a slippery mental state probably didn\u2019t help.",
