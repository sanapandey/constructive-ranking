The bright spot remained when I turned off my own headlight, in fact if anything it got relatively brighter when I turned my light off. There was a very bright moon tonight as well I should say. I called out few times but no answer ",

You are like 90% more safe in the woods at night than in a city at night.\n\nFunnily I did experience something similar to OP, seeing strange green lights in a forest at night, so I was curious and went in to take a look. It were just green spotlights of a factory that was at the edge of the forest, so nothing weird. Would have never known tho and would have always wondered, if I wouldn\u2019t have gone in there.",

I was a few beers in at this point, I think I just got a bit freaked at the thought someone had been sitting off in the trees near where I was sitting drinking beers all that time.

We were next to a drainage pond which was basically a large puddle. \n\nBefore we started smoking I joked we shouldn't stand here there could be gators hiding there. After a few hits I started thinking maybe a gator really could be in it. So I turned around and wouldn't stand with my back to it. Then I notice my wife keeps looking at it and slowly stepping away. That freaked me out even more so I took a big step away. \n\nThat set her off and she just started running. I assumed she actually saw one so I started running and yelling go go go. It wasn't until 2 minutes later when we got back to our room that we figured out what happened and that there was no alligators or crocodiles hiding in the puddle after all. \n\nSo don't feel too bad, our minds can make us do some real dumb shit sometimes.",
