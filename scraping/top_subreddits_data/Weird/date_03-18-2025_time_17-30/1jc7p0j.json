An empty package of cookies filled with broken leaves, twigs, seeds and even a thin piece of shale (to the left). I live on a densely populated street in a small town in a suburban neighborhood. Just really weird, can't explain why someone would do this. Has anyone ever heard of anything like this happening?",
