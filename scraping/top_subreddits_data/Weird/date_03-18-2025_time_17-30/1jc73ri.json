They walk her regularly in the same area so we also have timing on certain things. She is also becoming more and more aggressive when walking like looking for stuff and pulling them in different directions (she has lived in this area for years and only recently started acting like this after finding these things). \n\nThis peaked my interest because she found a dead cat/dog (we think it's a cat but hard to tell) in a bag left seemingly in a place that someone would find it, almost purposely left there for someone to open. They reported it to the park district. It then happened again in the same area with the same eiriness. It was like they replaced it once the other got taken care of. They also reported this one.\n\nShe has also found deer parts - I am familiar with coyotes and signs of prey left over and this doesn't seem to match that - it is more specific and strange parts of the animal. The area also doesn't have a large deer population at all and is separated from any major wildlife area. \n\nThe dog also took them to a random turkey that was wandering the trail but it was a domestic variety - very strange for the area. This was reported as well (the area is not one where poultry/livestock are common as pets or even allowed) \n\nWe have a few theories, some less creepy than others, but there is definitely an off feeling with it and like these things are connected. We truly hope it's nothing! \n\nBut that's why I am curious if this is in the same area. Ive heard a lot of stories about Illinois forest preserves and parks, just weird to see similar stuff happen in person...",

But the other day I was on a walk and just off the path I saw a pretty spot and wanted to take some photos. Walked off the path into the sheoaks, and less than 10 meters off the path, is a black garbage bag with unmistakabley bloody cloth falling out of it. Curiosity got me and I grabbed a stick and looked in the bag\u2026 dead cat. Just bone, so had been there for a while. But it was within view of the path! It just felt so off. The entire area felt so off. I covered it over so people couldn\u2019t see it from the path anymore, I felt so bad for the poor thing. \n\nSide note, I\u2019m house sitting and the pet cat just sat on me as I was typing this. I\u2019ve been here for three weeks and he hasn\u2019t sat on me once. Creepy",
