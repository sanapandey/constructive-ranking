There\u2019s so much (positive) information online and on reddit for that area that we have difficulties deciding. Also, we have never planned such trip before, so hoping to get some advice and insights here!\n\nAs we have around 10 full days, we\u2019d like to visit some cities and national parks and travel by car between the sights. \n\nFor now we mainly consider LA, SF, SD trip with Yosemite or Seattle, Portland and Vancouver with national parks around there. Or perhaps a combination of both, Seattle to SF. \n\nWhat\u2019d you recommend?",

            "body": "Yah, the first trip is always the hardest to plan.  For your first intercontinental trip, I'd definitely trim this list down.  Even for a well traveled American, that is potentially a very busy schedule.  For a ...Dutch? couple with little travel experience, that could be very overwhelming to the point of not being fun anymore.\n\nAs I suspect you are about to be told by many people, the travel distances between these cities are not trivial; for a European it would be like bouncing around between countries.  Without knowing you personally, I'd say just doing LA and San Diego is probably a good trip, with Joshua Tree somewhere in there.  I know Yosemite is tempting, but it's very crowded and you need to reserve well in advance, and so on.  It's worth the hassle, but for your first trip to the US, that might be a bit much to deal with.",

The train from Seattle to SF took 24 hours in itself, beautiful trip but it made me understand that North America is huge.  \n  \nYou could split the two, Vancouver has Lion\u2019s Bay which is really close to the centre and is beautiful. From there Seattle is about 3 hours by bus/car, and then fly down to either SF or LA where you can explore the national parks from.",

Ofcourse nothing compared to a trip with multiple destinations in the west. \n\nWe\u2019d really love to combine our trip with some insane sights, to make it unforgettable. Also kind of afraid we get bored being in a city for the full time. \n\nWould you prefer LA over SF? Any other national parks you\u2019d recommend which are unforgettable? Seattle and Portland with Olympic and North Cascades was one consideration with less travelling, but most of reddit states that the pacific is boring compared to the south.",

As a general answer, I think LA might be a better choice for most tourists.  There are more obvious tourist attractions, and it's culturally a more interesting place.  SF is prettier, and arguably has a better fine dining scene, but LA's food scene is probably superior as a whole.  \n\nIt's tough to pick among the national parks.  I'm a big fan and a regular visitor, and they're pretty much all breathtaking.  But I think for a European, maybe a desert park like Joshua Tree might be best, as the parks notable for snow-capped mountains might be similar enough enough to the Alps that it might be less interesting to you.  This is based on my visit to Wadi Rum, a desert in Jordan where I met Europeans who were really awestruck.  To me it was beautiful and worth visiting, but sort of similar to Arizona.\n\nBut yeah, where West Coast national parks go, you basically can't go wrong.",

If you're coming to SF and you're interested in our parks, then I'd also go to Muir Woods National Monument, which is close by.  It's not technically a \"National Park\" by the definition Americans use when they're making their bucket lists, but it's a large enough forest of redwood trees for you to go hiking without hearing motorcars and such.  Much closer than Yosemite; you might even be able to Uber there from SF, although it will cost a pretty penny.  \n\nI know I said all our national parks are great, and they are, but having said that, I don't know if I want to send you to Pinnacles, which is the closest NP to SF.  It's mostly notable for being a place where you can see California condors, which I don't know if anyone other than old wildlife geeks like me care about.  If you're already going to Joshua Tree, I don't think a European needs to do Pinnacles.",

Yosemite is just stunning, but research the crowds and possible admission reservations for your dates. Also lodging in and near the Park is quite difficult.\n\nIf you want mountains you could also consider Sequoia/Kings Canyon national parks, which are in the area and also beautiful. Joshua Tree if you want to see amazing desert landscapes.\n\nIn San Francisco, a fairly short trip north takes you to Muir Woods, with giant coastal redwood trees. It is also magnificent.\n\nThe ideas above reduce your travel distances compared to what you original posted while preserving great scenery and wow factors.",

The answer really depends on what you're looking for.\n\nIf this is about nature and the outdoors, then Seattle/Portland is by far the better choice, but you will need a car. I'd encourage you to consider the Oregon Coast west of Portland and look at the 101 N from there as it loops through various parks to Port Angeles at the north end of Washington. You can either grab a ferry into Victoria British Columbia from there and see a little of Canada or simply head toward Seattle. I'd recommend a slight detour through Port Townsend on your way into Seattle.\n\nIf you want urban experiences, LA is the place to go for live music, art, nightlife and the like. You will also need a car there.\n\nSan Francisco is the city to go to if you're trying to avoid needing a car. It's less vibrant than LA, but much more compact -- you can get by on Taxis/Ubers/etc plus walking.\n\nPortland, LA, and San Francisco all have great food scenes. If food it a major motivator, Seattle isn't the best choice.\n\nEDIT: If nature is the motivating factor, consider the southwest. The Grand Canyon and Utah parks (Bryce Canyon, Arches, Zion) and natural wonders unlike anyplace else I've ever seen. But it's a very different trip than what you're already talking about.",

Seattle will be easy to eat in, but very few places put the same level of thought and care into vegan options as they do the rest of the menu (again, I can make recommendations if you decide to go north).\n\nAlso important to know, the northwest has a late summer, so ideal weather is August whereas California is likely June before it gets too warm.",

As others have said, the distances are huge and you don\u2019t want to spend your whole trip driving or on trains/planes.\n\nAs to which one is better I think that it depends what you are looking for. They are very different areas in terms of culture and climate. \n\nSouthern California is much warmer and dryer with beautiful beaches. Yosemite is absolutely worth a visit, but unless it is really the top of your list I would skip it on this trip. It will be very crowded and it\u2019s a ~4 hour drive from SF. \n\nThe PNW is very green and wetter/colder than California. (Though in August it\u2019s likely to be sunny and fairly warm -high 20s to low 30sC)The coast is beautiful but too cold for swimming/sunbathing. There are a lot of beautiful national parks, waterfalls, mountains.\n\nI live in Portland and the PNW is absolutely my favorite part of the country, but given where you are coming from and the fact that it\u2019s your first west coast trip I would probably recommend doing Southern California unless you really prefer forests to beaches. It\u2019s a classic travel destination for a reason.\n\nAlso because I\u2019ve not seen it mentioned yet: August is forest fire season on the west coast. Keep an eye on the local news for wherever you are headed and be prepared to change your itinerary if needed.",

Now I live in Lisbon, so I\u2019ve traveled around Europe quite a bit, including the Netherlands. So here\u2019s my take.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest and California are pretty different trips. As different as spending 10 days in southern Spain vs northern Italy. Actually, even San Francisco and San Diego are super different. So it really depends on what kind of trip you\u2019re looking for. \n\nIf you want sun and beach, Southern California is great. But it can also get pretty hot in August- very different than what you\u2019re used to. Also, the public transportation in California is awful and driving in the summer when everybody else is on vacation will be terrible.  \n\nAlthough the public transportation in the Pacific Northwest isn\u2019t nearly as good as what you would find in the Netherlands, it\u2019s significantly better than California. \n\nIf it were me, I would choose the Pacific Northwest and probably start out in Portland. Then take the train to Seattle- that\u2019s a beautiful train ride. Then after Seattle, take a ferry to Victoria (on Vancouver Island). Finally, travel to Vancouver.\n\nI really think you\u2019ll appreciate the landscape in the Pacific Northwest and the weather will likely be better than Southern California. Plus, the food in Portland is amazing- unlike anything you\u2019ll get in the Netherlands. And I f you like beer, both Portland and Seattle have a lot of great breweries. Victoria and Vancouver are beautiful cities, with so much nature. \n\nI hope that helps! Keep us posted on what you decide. Now I\u2019m super curious!",

Unless you're obsessed with celebrity culture and really want to do the Hollywood thing, LA is going to be enormous , hard to get around and can be expensive.\n\nPortland to Seattle to Olympic NP to Victoria/Vancouver is just magical. Really spend some time looking into transit times, even getting a car from Seattle to Olympic NP entrance is 2 hours. If you're renting a car, tag on another hour. That area is lush, quaint, and has some amazing seafood. If you're a nature lover, it's hard to top.",

Honestly I've been all over the globe and I think Olympic national park is some of the most beautiful landscapes I've ever seen. \n\nOr, you could do a California trip. Los Angeles to San Francisco is like a 6-7 hour drive.

In SF you get more quaint little neighbors hoods with nature kind of woven in. \n\nI live in NorCal and it absolutely never gets old. I would suggest doing Big Sur with Yosemite and then up into SF and further on to Mendocino. That would keep you busy for 10 days but if you\u2019re worried if not enough you could also reach up to the Redwoods and the Oregon Coast which also stunning.",
