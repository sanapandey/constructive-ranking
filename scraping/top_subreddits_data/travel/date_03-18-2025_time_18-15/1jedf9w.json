    "selftext": "Since 2016, I have written out \"Go back to Bali\" as my new years goal or manifestations etc.   \nTraveling there is difficult for me as I'm in the US. It'll require 12+ hour flight + layover+ another 8-9 hour flight. I could go to somewhere like US Virgin Islands for a fraction of the time.  \n  \nI have not been to Bali in over 10+ years. I have some fond memories as it was the last place I traveled with my paternal grandmother before I lost her to cancer. I remember holding my nana's hand, and her head resting on my shoulder as we watched the fire dance in Uluwatu temple.. I remember the heat, the music, dance, even the way the air smelled...Is my grandma calling me there? I don't know but I feel like I need to go find out. Perhaps I'm supposed to to have some \"Eat, Pray, and Love\" journey.. Lately I feel like the whole universe is realigning itself to be back on my side. I feel at peace after deciding to leave my 10+ year marriage. \n\nI'm not sure when or how I'm going to manage to get to Bali.. but while I figure this out.. I couldn't help but wonder if anyone traveled to a destination that kept calling out to you, and was it life changing when you finally went there?? ",
