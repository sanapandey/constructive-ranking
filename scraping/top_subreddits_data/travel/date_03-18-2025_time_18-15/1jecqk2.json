    "selftext": "We're planning a trip to England around April or early May to visit family. While we're there, we'd love to take a short 2-3 day beach vacation so our 3-year-old can have some fun.  \n\nAny suggestions for affordable, nonstop flights from Heathrow to a warm, safe, family-friendly beachy destination? We've already been to Mallorca, so we're looking for other options other than Spain.\n\nEdited: doesn\u2019t have to be Heathrow. But any airport in London! ",

They won't necessarily show up on flight comparison sites though \n\nAll of them are \"low cost carriers\", so they will advertise a fare, but then you will pay extra if you want baggage (with some of them this includes larger cabin baggage) or to be able to select your own seat.  Their fares are normally non-refundable and non-changeable without a hefty fee.  The price they advertise _is_ bookable though for it's stated inclusions and does include all taxes and fees though.  If you are used to fares being 'inclusive' of certain things then you might want to make sure you go past the extras selection pages for comparison purposes.\n\nObviously flying on Fridays or weekends is more expensive than during the rest of the week if you are flexible.",
