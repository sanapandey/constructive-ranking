One week in Barcelona and surroundings is barely enough, I wouldn\u2019t waste time going to Andorra from there",

The capital of Andorra la Vella is pretty scenic, you can spend some time walking around, and checking out Caldea Spa and the Rec de l'Obac walking route.\n\nI had a rental car when I visited and explored a bit outside the capital. Interesting sites include the Esglesia de Santa Coloma d'Andorra church built in the 9-12th century, the Pont de la Margineda bridge built in the 14-15th century and the El Pas de la Casa village located at over 2,000m altitude. I also enjoyed [Tobotronc](https://web.naturland.ad/en/activities/tobotronc).",
