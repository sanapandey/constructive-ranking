            "body": "...at the risk of sounding like the oldest man in the world, I like to go to the bookshop and look through all the relevant guidebooks and see which ones I like the most.  That way I get to try out what I'm buying and also give my money to a local small business to boot.  But to be brutally honest, guidebooks are of limited usefulness these days.  I like going through them to see what ideas they might have that I hadn't thought of, but in terms of informing me about hotels and restaurants and such, it's never going to be as reliable as online references.",

That means countless hundreds and hundreds of millions have gone before you... which means the tourist infrastructure is extremely well developed... which means it's super well documented by countless internet resources which in my opinion will blow any guidebook out of the water.\n\nThat said, if you really want a book to hold onto then go a book store and leaf through DK Eyewitness, Fodor or an older Lonely Planet.\n\nHappy travels.",
