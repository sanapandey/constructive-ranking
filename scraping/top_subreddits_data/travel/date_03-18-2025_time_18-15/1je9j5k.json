I only hand them a copy of my passport and tell them passport is in the safe at the hotel, they\u2019re welcomed to see it there. They get flustered but I\u2019ve never had to pay them to get my passport back. I have family living there so I\u2019ve heard and seen a lot of scams in Thailand. Never hand over your passport there! I almost always leave them in the safe unless I\u2019m staying in a cheaper/shadier area. Then in an inside backpack pocket.",

I can\u2019t risk forgetting the passcode or just plain forgetting it as I\u2019m leaving the hotel. I will carry it in places like Japan to the tax free discount. I will NOT carry it in places where I might run into the police. I was once stopped by the police for jaywalking in Shanghai. There was a subway station that was under construction and you had to leave the station and go above ground in order to transfer. The subway people set up confusion signs on how to get to the other train line that led you to cross this tiny street. Rather than direct traffic, the police were station on both sides to wait for people to jaywalk and then ticket them. We walked across the street like a lot of people and then got stopped by the police. He asked me for my ID and I told him I\u2019m American and didn\u2019t have my passport. My husband (white) pulled out his drivers license and started handing it to the cop. I grabbed it out of his hand and said to the cops that we don\u2019t have any IDs he could use. I ended up getting into a shouting match with the police bc I was very worried about being ticketed. I was very worried our IDs would be written down somewhere and we wouldn\u2019t be able to get our visas renewed in the future. I have a lot of family in Shanghai so it would be terrible to not be able to visit them. The cop eventually just didn\u2019t want to deal with me and let us go. Depending on where you are and the culture, it\u2019s sometimes better to be too big of a pain in the ass to be scammed or demanded a bribe or ticketed.",
