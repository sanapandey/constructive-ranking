    "selftext": "I travel a lot... I've used luggage storage facilities in several countries.  Never have I been so violated as to when I went out of Rome\u00a0*Fiumicino Airport (FCO)... Stored my luggage overnight (Terminal 3) near* the buses\\*.. ..And,\\* myself and a friend dropped off our luggage, we *hopped* over *to AMS for an overnight trip... and silly me thinking it was* safe to leave my small laptop inside my luggage.\n\nThe luggage was scanned, they took my passport, I'd never had issues before with any other luggage facility.  Then, viola when I get back from AMS and checked my luggage... Laptop and a few other small items were taken.  The language barrier didn't help but ofc they denied it, and said, (if this really happened, then you need to file a report. I won't go into the details of all the running around they sent me on.  Left Rome and communicated with Police and Airport officials for them via email for a month.. Explaining the to them where my MacBook Pro was located. The smirk on their faces when I explained it told me immediately--- I wasn't getting it back, and it seemed as if this was not anything they had not heard before.  So, do yourself a favor.. Never store your luggage where there are people manning the facility, always used the ones that have a lock and key or code.  Thank goodness, my renters insurance covered my laptop, and I had backed up a few days before.  Im calm now, but going through it was a nightmare... Travel safely.",
