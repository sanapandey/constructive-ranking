So many first timers come to travel forums and expect everyone to turn in their private Travel Agent and plan everything for them. Kudos to you.  \n  \nYou've put together quite an itinerary and it's a fantastic guide/template to start your trip. That said, I think you should be prepared to throw your plan into the trash bin.  \n  \nThe best thing *by far* about the privilege of having the time/money for a long trip is flexibility. 1.) There will be places you fall in love with and will want to stay longer... 2.) There will be places where the vibe just isn't happening and you'll want to move on immediately... 3.) And most importantly there will be places\u00a0you've never even heard of that you'll learn about from locals and other travellers and you'll want to detour to check them out...  \n  \nBottom line: Make use of this wonderful opportunity and be open to spontaneity. Be prepared to get off the Banana Pancake Trail and away from the usual tourist centres every now and then. And very importantly be prepared to slow down a little and not be worried about checking boxes with excursions and landmarks. You have a very generous budget and that makes itinerary adjustments very easy.  \n  \nHappy travels. You're going to some fabulous destinations. You're going to love it.",
