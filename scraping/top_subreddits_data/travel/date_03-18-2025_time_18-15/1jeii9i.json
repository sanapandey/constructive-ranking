    "selftext": "I'm planning a trip to Normandy that will straddle the D-Day anniversary. I'm looking for some advice on what the vibe is like at that time and some additional things to do. Right now, my thoughts are as follows:\n\n* Is there any kind of service or memorial on June 6th? Specifically for Juno beach but I'd welcome information regarding the others.\n* The Bayeux tapestry museum is a must-see for me but I'll be going with a group who probably won't be so interested in it. What else is there in Bayeux for them to do? I believe there's a D-Day museum there but is there anything else of note that isn't a museum? Gotta keep these people content so I can enjoy my tapestry.\n* I do love a good castle. I plan to go to the Caen museum with the castle. I've read mixed reviews on Chateau Gaillard, is it worth seeing? And are there any other castles worth checking out?\n* Mont St. Michel is obviously on the list. Undecided on whether to stay overnight.\n* Second only to my love of castles is my love of submarines, so I'll be going to visit Le Redoutable in Cherbourg. Are there any other maritime/naval sights worth visiting?\n\nLastly, I'm not sure exactly how to divide the nights. Definitely we'll do one in Caen and one in Bayeux. I would like to do one in Mont St. Michel but we're undecided on that. Typing this out I'm realizing that I really would like to spend more time puttering around to see all the local cities. Alas. Anyway, of Rouen, Le Havre, Cherbourg, St. Malo, and Rennes (throwing it in because I've heard good things), does anyone have strong recommendations on where to stay?",
