Can't find any info on Peru nationalpark service etc. Very tricky time to go in mars. Things like that can happen. Look up alternatives to do. Machu Picchu will problably be open but the trekks seems closed according to the embassy, so better have alternatives to do planed.",

I lucked out. 2 years ago I did Manaslu Trek. There was an earthquake in Nepal a few hours after my plane departed Kathmandu\n \ud83d\ude02 So folks heads up, within the next 2 weeks i'll be starting a 2-3 months long road trip heading southwest and working my way up to Pacific Northwest. Expect fireworks soon. \ud83d\ude00",
