    "selftext": "Pretty much the title, I used Priceline for flights and car rental. Priceline charged me $700 for the car which included the underage fee. Then when I picked up the car I paid $600, I thought this what the security deposit. When it didn\u2019t get back to my card after a week I called Avis and they said it should be back by today. \n\nNow it\u2019s not back so I called again and this time they said it wasn\u2019t the security deposit and that it was incurrence and underage fee.  But then I didn\u2019t pay a security deposit??? When I asked for a manager the lady got very rude and condescending, telling me Priceline never paid them, so now I\u2019m on hold with Priceline trying to get my money back. (Also each call had a wait time of 30+ minutes. Never using Priceline or Avis again.) \n\nAnyone have this happen? How did you get it resolved? ",

Unfortunately the only thing you can do is keep calling Priceline, and hopefully learn from your experience. Don\u2019t book with a 3rd party in the future. It is usually less expensive upfront- but you get what you pay for.",

I went with Priceline cuz my dad who travels a lot suggested it but lesson learned. Either way definitely not going with Avis again after the terrible customer service",
