    "selftext": "Did the Vatican Museums give you the big Wow? \n\nI was trying to buy tickets on their dogshit website and failed, now it is sold out for my dates and I'm feeling a bit embittered at the thought of paying twice as much on a re-selling website. I would eat that feeling if I got there and it felt really special. But I have been to enough famous Museums that sometimes they are just fine. I realise this is a very subjective thing and would just like your gut reaction. \n\nI should say I'm going to the Caravaggio exhibition so I will already be seeing quite a bit of art. ",

It's a lot of mosaics, statues from ancient civilizations, and murals depicting the victory of Christianity over paganism.   The map room is pretty cool as is the optical illusion ceiling.  There are no placards with descriptions for a majority of the pieces and those that do have them only list dates and locations.  Without a guide you're not sure what you are looking at or it's meaning unless you are really familiar with art history or do the audio tour.  The tour guide was really good at explaining things but it still felt rushed and they leave you at the Sistine Chapel entrance, unless you pay for a private tour. I was struck with a mix of awe and slight disgust but that's a different discussion.",

It was incredibly unpleasant to the extent I couldn\u2019t really enjoy much of the art anyways. And idk what the deal was that day but EVERYONE was speaking in the Sistine chapel. It was loud. I was shocked. I think part of the problem may have been it was the end of the day. Can\u2019t recall if I went earlier in the day the first time, but I probably did. And it was also pre Covid.\n\nI think you should go if you end up being able to, but don\u2019t sweat it too much if you do something else that day instead.

I mean seriously the Sistine Chapel is awesome too, but standing just below *The School of Athens* also felt like an amazing treat\n\nThe museum is absolutely insanely crowded, that's for sure, but if you really want to feel like your walking through a living art history textbook then I think the Vatican museum is one of the best.",

And then after that you walk through a tourist gauntlet of photos of the SISTINE CHAPEL?  Too sacred to take a photo of unless needed for an expensive trinket. \nThe Pinoteca was crammed, poorly lit, no area to have a moment with the artwork. \nThe statuary was nice, but still so crammed with tourists\n\nwhat I would wholly recommend however is The Borghese. You want to see a Caravaggio in a wonderful setting? Some beautiful impossible statuary?  In a peaceful beautiful location?  This is your place. Go early for the opening. On entering go all the way up to the top floor and work your way down. This way you have most of the museum completely to yourself. \n\nlastly, The Capitoline. Go late afternoon to time it on exiting it is the blue hour over Rome. The Capitoline has some amazing very important works and relics of Constantine. Peaceful and a wonderful place to spend some time with a piece of art. \n\nI love Rome, there is so much to explore that is beautiful I have no further time for tourist trap crammed areas. \nDont eat anywhere near the Venetto. Do eat everything down toward Campo Fiore and Trestavere. \n\nCin Cin",
