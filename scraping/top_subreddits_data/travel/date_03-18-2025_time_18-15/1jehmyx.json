It looks like there\u2019s an intercity that is direct 3:44, and so it should be like 4.5 hours.\n\nThe French commuter rail stops in Monaco on the way from Ventimiglia to Nice.",

But make sure to check the Italian train because the direct one saves you an hour it looks like. The SCNF train runs frequently.",
