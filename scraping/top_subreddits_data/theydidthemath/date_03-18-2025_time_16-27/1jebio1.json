Printing it larger doesn\u2019t make it more accurate, it only changes the scale of the measuring tool you work with in taking readings, unless you want to get into discussions of rasterization for display or print composition.\u00a0\n\nIf you want to know what size a map would have to be drawn at initially to be perfectly accurate, the common answer is \u201cfull scale\u201d; look into the coastline problem. I\u2019m not sure this is the only possibility, we could discuss entirely implausible nonsense ideas like holography, but we are getting a bit afield from \u201cmap\u201d at that point",
