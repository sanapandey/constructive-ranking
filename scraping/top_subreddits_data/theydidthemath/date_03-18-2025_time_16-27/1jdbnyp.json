Don't forget the JWST has different lenses to see many different spectrums, and we do not have that same ability. So while it may be hard for us, it would not be for the JWST.\n\nThe weight thing, no clue.

To make them stop moving so much you need to put a lot of energy into it (pressure). Release that pressure and they all bounce against each other rapidly and spread out that way.\n\nExpand rapidly is just a joke way of saying exploding. Simply because the atoms will bounce so hard against each other they fly out in an explosion.\n\nGas molecules and atoms move around much much more, so the space between them is much greater. That's why it's easier to reduce that space.\n\nThink of a pressurized tank of air. Poke a hole in it and it'll blow up. Kinda the same principle with solids and liquids if you manage to give it enough pressure.\n\nKeep in mind though, to increase the density by 40 times on a solid requires such an insanely high pressure it's not even funny. When all that pressure is released it would explode with an insane force.\n\nTo give you a little perspective, the Earth's core has 3.6 MILLION times the pressure compared to the air we breathe, but it only increases the density of the metals by 50%. Now imagine the pressure needed to increase it by 40 times.\n\nOxygen turns into a liquid at just 50 times the atmosphere. And that only lets it become a liquid at -119\u00b0C instead of -183\u00b0C.",

The strong nuclear force between nucleons is stronger than the electrostatic repulsion between protons at short distances, but it drops off much faster with distance. (It's more like a polarization force than like a static charge force.) So as atoms get larger, the protons are being repelled strongly by ALL the protons in the atom, but are only being held tightly by a small region of nucleons around them, so they're much less tightly bound to the nucleus.\n\nNow, there do exist what we call \"islands of stability\" in the periodic table, where an element is more stable than the other elements around it. But my understanding is that ones high up in the periodic table are expected to just make half-lives that are days to years, not actual *stable* elements.

Adding neutrons is going to the right on [this chart](https://www-nds.iaea.org/relnsd/vcharthtml/VChartHTML.html), and you can see that as you go right you generally get to beta-minus decay. You can even switch from alpha decay to beta-minus, with the additional neutrons spreading out the protons and making alpha decay less likely, while simultaneously making beta-minus decay more likely by having too many neutrons.\n\nAs for why \"too many neutrons\" is a thing, I can only really explain it using quantum states and the principle that things trend towards low-energy states. So you know how electrons exist in \"orbitals\", with some orbitals being lower energy and some higher energy, and only some number of electrons can fit in each orbital? My understanding is that a similar thing exist for protons and neutrons. The first neutron in a particular nucleus occupies a low-energy quantum state. The second neutron can't occupy that lowest energy quantum state, because that one is already occupied. So it needs to be in a higher energy state. But this is separate for protons and neutrons. So if you have 3 neutrons, it will be lower energy to turn one of the neutrons into a proton, since that would let two things be at the lowest energy quantum state.\n\nI don't really know the *mechanism* of that change, but it makes sense from a \"things trend towards lower energy states\" perspective.",

There's zero chance that the asteroid has a density 3.5 times greater than the densest element known. Even the author of the (only) study that measured it considered the value to be incorrect.\n\n>In 2012, a study by Beno\u00eet Carry gave a meta-estimate of a mass of\u00a0(6.20\u00b10.74)\u00d710^(18)\u00a0kg\u00a0for Polyhymnia, based on a single study of its gravitational influence on other Solar System bodies.[^(\\[5\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Polyhymnia#cite_note-Carry2012-5)\u00a0However, given Polyhymnia's diameter of 54\u00a0km (34\u00a0mi), this mass implies an extremely high\u00a0[density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density)\u00a0of\u00a075.28\u00b19.71\u00a0g/cm^(3). Such a high density is unrealistic, so this mass and density estimate of Polyhymnia was considered unreliable by Carry.[^(\\[5\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Polyhymnia#cite_note-Carry2012-5)\u00a0Several other asteroids with diameters similar to Polyhymnia were also measured to have extremely high densities in Carry's study, and were rejected for being unrealistic.[^(\\[5\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Polyhymnia#cite_note-Carry2012-5)\u00a0Because of Polyhymnia's small size, its gravitational influence on other bodies is extremely difficult to detect and may lead to highly inaccurate mass and density estimates.[^(\\[5\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Polyhymnia#cite_note-Carry2012-5)\u00a0For example, the 68\u00a0km (42\u00a0mi)-diameter asteroid\u00a0[675 Ludmilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/675_Ludmilla)\u00a0was originally measured to have a density of\u00a073.99\u00b115.05\u00a0g/cm^(3)\u00a0in Carry's study,[^(\\[5\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Polyhymnia#cite_note-Carry2012-5)\u00a0but improved orbit calculations in 2019 showed that it had a much lower density of\u00a03.99\u00b11.94\u00a0g/cm^(3).[^(\\[14\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Polyhymnia#cite_note-SiMDA-675-14)\n\n>No other\u00a0[peer-reviewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-review)\u00a0study has attempted to determine a mass and density for Polyhymnia since Carry's study,[^(\\[15\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Polyhymnia#cite_note-SiMDA-33-15)\u00a0though in 2023, researcher Fan Li performed a preliminary analysis of Polyhymnia's close approaches with other asteroids and determined a lower mass of\u00a0(1.03\u00b10.40)\u00d710^(18)\u00a0kg.[^(\\[16\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Polyhymnia#cite_note-Li2023-39045-16)\u00a0Depending on the diameter used for Polyhymnia, this mass estimate suggests a density of\u00a07.5\u00b13.6\u00a0g/cm^(3)\u00a0or\u00a012.4\u00a0g/cm^(3), for an\u00a0[occultation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_occultation)\\-derived diameter of 64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0km (39.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7\u00a0mi) and infrared-derived diameter of 54\u00a0km (34\u00a0mi), respectively.[^(\\[16\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Polyhymnia#cite_note-Li2023-39045-16)[^(\\[17\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33_Polyhymnia#cite_note-Li2023-39046-17)",
