After writing (k+2) digits plus the % sign (and ignoring the dot), the weight of the bar is W = 12.5 + 0.0000017 * (k+3) kg.\n\nFor 99.9...9% of the mass to be the gold with k decimal places, we must have (10^(-k) x W) in *just* the ink. \nSo, set 0.0000017 * (k+3) = 10^-k * W. \nSolving via Wolfram alpha, we get one real solution at k \u2248 4.965, so we'll say 5 decimal places are needed.\n\nI.e. you have to write 99.99999%\n\nIf you increase T (the duration of the pen) by a factor of 10 but keep the capacity the same, then the number of decimal places increases by 1, so if the same pen can write 100,000 letters, then we'd need 6dp.",

Just a little less than the weight they say it is. \n\nSpecifically if we take the 0.0000017kg per letter weight \n\n100% written in ink is 4 x 0.0000017kg = 0.0000068kg\nSo 12.5kg bar - 0.0000068kg ink = 12.4999932kgs of gold\n\nAt 97.08 USD per gram. It's $97,080 per kg. \nYou're losing $97080x0.0000068 = $0.660144",

We'll also assume that the writing is 30cm of pen strokes (since writing more will affect the answer, which will affect how much you have to write). This gives us a volume of ink of 3.75 microlitres.\n\nMarkers are generally alcohol based, so we'll assume a liquid density of 0.8kg/L, which gives us a mass of ink of 3 micrograms.\n\nSo without the ink the gold is 12.4kg. With the ink, it is 12.400003kg\n\nSo it would have a purity of 99.999976%",
