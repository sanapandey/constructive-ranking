At some point, it becomes cheaper and more efficient to change rules and laws to allow hoarding of wealth than innovating and continued success.\n\nI think a lot of people do not realise that capitalism accumulating capital by whatever means necessary is not a \"curious side-effect\", but the definition of capitalism.\n\nCapitalism is not about \"breeding innovation\" and \"continuing success\", it is about a profit-driven economy, and whatever causes the most profits is considered the best option (because early capitalist thinkers thought that profit is always aligned with the good of the society), because that's how the entire economy rolls. If at some point people cannot innovate (which to be honest, can happen), capitalism is forced (in order to sustain itself) to just start gutting wages, lowering product expectations etc, because otherwise it will crash.\n\nCapitalism requires a constant expansion/profit increase, and it needs to achieve that by whatever means necessary, unless you want complete economic collapse. Sometimes there just isn't enough space to innovate or create a huge advancement gap, and this leads to capitalism self-cannibalizing. There is a reason capitalist economics can drive a nation out of poverty (huge gaps that can be filled in), but cause developed countries to crumble under their own weight (USA/European nations right now).\n\n\"Well we can just regulate it and maybe expect less\" is simply anti-thetical to capitalism, that is what socdems tried to do and failed miserably, most socdem economics also didn't play out long term.\n\nThis is the analysis/critique socialists made almost 1 and a half century ago, that still stands true today.",

(The papers differs on their estimations of inequality levels, but find the same trend).\n\n\nIn the mid XXth century inequality stabilizes, thanks mostly to the convergence between Asia (China) and Europe, as well as other developments like a reduction in internal inequaliy in\u00a0Europe.\u00a0There was also a massive reduction in life expectancy inequality during the XXth century, despite the persistance of income inequality.\n\n\nThe most notable result is probably that the biggest determinant of world inequality is inequality between different countries, rather than within countries. So practically all changes in world inequality are explained by variations in the relative growth of different countries. At least, that was the case until recently, per the second paper, which claims (finds) that internal inequalities are the more relevant factor in the XXIth century.",

Now let me ask:  \nWhat is causing the massive spike in population?  \n  \nHumanity numbered in the millions only for thousands of years.  \nThen, suddenly, out of nowhere, Europe undergoes a Renaissance, an Agricultural boom, an Industrial revolution, and the population of the planet booms to 1 billion, to 2 billion, and to 3 billion in a very short period of time.  \n  \nWhat is your explanation for this? \"Science?\" But the Greeks, the Romans, and the Arabs also had massive improvement in learning, knowledge, and education. Why did one intellectual era give us the Library of Alexandria, but this era gave us computers, airplanes, and 8 billion people?\n  \nThe answer from one side is that economics explains this. Society accepted a system of free trade and Laissez-faire, and wealth exploded.  \n  \nToday, we are seeing industrialization in China, India, Vietnam, and throughout the Pacific and Africa. Those very countries that accepted \"capitalism\" and \"extortion\" are the very places that are booming the fastest.  \n  \nSo what is *your* claim? Do you claim that global population is booming because people have *less* food and *less* healthcare? Are people *less* well off than before? Is your claim that \"wage slavery\" created all of this boom in society and living standards... And that's bad?  \n  \nEven if you disagree with the % of people who belong in the \"I make more than $2 a day (adjusted for inflation and cost of living)\" category, that is just a %. But the decrease in the % of the population that is \"poor\" is accompanied with a massive increase in the means for population to expand.  \n  \nBut perhaps you claim that it is the middle class of the world who are getting jipped. Perhaps the \"rich\" have increased by 4000%, but the middle class has only increased by 8% (as the OP claims). But if what you care about is inequality, then *isn't this a good thing?* Because if society has indeed exploded with wealth (and it has), then that means that the middle didn't benefit, but *the poor very much have.* If what you care about is inequality, then shouldn't you be happy that China and India increased their standard of living by 200 years in only a couple generations? Why are you more concerned about your own privileged position (globally speaking), as a privileged Westerner with Internet access and access to infinite education and opportunities, but you are upset that someone in Vietnam is able to work a factory job instead of burning their hands working an Agricultural job? Because that is what \"capitalism\" gave us.",

And that's bad?  \n\nAh yes, \"living standards\", more and more people are impoverished, without food or homes, and more and more become subjugated to corporate imperialism and exploitation for the profit of the imperial periphery, but the convenient propaganda of capitalism frames \"quality of life/higher living standards\" as being equivalent to GDP, which is a meaningless metrix to base social security and progress off of. America has an insanely high GDP and yet a majority of people can't afford basic things like rent or utilities, let alone surprise emergency expenses, we have more vacant houses than empty homes, and millions starve and die from poverty every year despite us producing more than enough to avoid these problems. And you want to claim capitalism is a success because we have \"the freedom\" to engage with a plethora of industries that have privatized and therefore locked out access to a variety of crucial human needs like food, housing, and healthcare? This is also of coursing ignoring the excessive imperialism of the American empire, establishing military bases and racketeering foreign markets to adopt our currency so they can become dependent on it and therefore increase the power of our currency and influence on maintaining global capitalist hegemony.\n\n> the middle class has only increased by 8% (as the OP claims). But if what you care about is inequality, then *isn't this a good thing?* Because if society has indeed exploded with wealth (and it has), then that means that the middle didn't benefit, but *the poor very much have.*\n\nBasic material analysis shows this isn't the case. Millions die due to lack of food, homes, resources, Healthcare, all things fucked by private markets and the commodification of every aspect of human existence. Things that can easily be eradicated. United could have approved all of their denied health care claims and STILL turned a profit, but didn't. This is the basic conclusion of capitalist systems. Poor people are not better off, not least of all for being born into a more complex market with more commodities. They certainly aren't better off for having more resources privatized. This really isn't that hard to understand. It's so laughably out of touch and disingenuous to claim that capitalism has lifted people out of poverty when it literally creates the conditions for it and directly benefits from it.",

Please explain how those translate to other economic systems. Sure other economies can be measured in terms of GDP which is the primary metric used, but as capitalism is basically maximizing GDP growth they are directly linking economies that are capitalistic to those of lower inequality. Seems like this metric was chosen to make capitalism appear to reduce inequality while other economic systems seem like they do so less effectively or increase inequality. \n\nThe only non capitalism centric measure is life expectancy which is clearly not viable on its own as an indicator for inequality as you can have high life expectancy and high inequality and low inequality and low life expectancy. \n\n\u201cAccounts for that\u201d is a wild statement to make in this instance.",

So I guess my one-liner would be something like \"using GDP/PPP to measure inequality is misguided at best and needs very accurate data - something which was not present in the range of time presented in the study.\" \n\n  \nI do not have a direct source for another means to measure inequality off the top of my head and I don't need to prove a different metric is better to invalidate the one used in the study. My guess would be accurately estimating inequality farther back than 80-100 years is a massive multifaceted endeavor that is well beyond the expertise of any one discipline.    \n\n  \nusing GDP/PPP is invalid, IMO, because it fails to be applicable to other economic systems. if it was just measuring capitalist economies after enclosure then I would say it can be used to estimate poverty rates but there are probably better means to do so such as [https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/measuringpoverty#2](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/measuringpoverty#2) (keep in mind this still should only be applied to select economic systems but as most of the world now has capitalist economies it's generally applicable now but not so much 200 years ago).",

They send actual people to actual stores to track prices (they do stuff online as well). What is in the basket can change, but they will try to keep it to basics, like bread and rent. The CPI is used to measure inflation. \n\nIf the CPI goes up 3%, but wages grow 5%, \u201cpeople\u201d are getting ahead. Flip the numbers and people are falling behind. \n\nNow, like a lot of things, the devil is in the details. Do they use executive total wages, or just salary? The list of things will be as steady as they can make it, but is it too steady?  Are they tracking DVD prices when they should be tracking Netflix (etc.)? If shelter is weighted at 30% but people are spending a higher % than that is it accurate? If they change it too often, it is useless, but if they don\u2019t change it enough it is also useless. It\u2019s a tricky balance. \n\nThis link is a decent explanation, though it is a few years old:  https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/01/24/as-inflation-soars-a-look-at-whats-inside-the-consumer-price-index/\n\nNOTE: If the government ever asks you how you spend your money, TELL THEM.

People with high-socioeconomic status often:\n\n- Have reduced empathy and compassion.\n- Have a diminished ability to see from someone else's perspective.\n- Have low impulse control.\n- Have an extreme sense of entitlement.\n- Have a hoarding disorder.\n- Have a dangerously high tolerance for risk.\n\nWhen you don't need to cooperate with other people to survive, they become irrelevant to you. When you're in charge, you can behave very badly and people will still be polite and respectful toward you. Instead of reciprocity, it's a formalized double standard. When you have status, you're given excessive credibility, and rarely hear the very ordinary push-back from others most of us are accustomed to, instead you receive flattery and praise and your ideas are taken seriously by default.\n\nHumans have a strong need for egalitarianism; without it our brains malfunction and turn us into the worst versions of ourselves.\n\n  *Some sources:*\n\n---\n**Hubris syndrome: An acquired personality disorder?

A car is objectively better for travel than walking but a car has become necessary in many places. From a transportation perspective if you don\u2019t need a car now or in the past you have more wealth than someone who does. A car requires upkeep and fuel in addition to its initial cost and these will far exceed the value of the car over time. This can be applied to a lot of things. Air conditioning, when living in many places, is a necessity. Not having it in Phoenix, AZ can be deadly but one\u2019s wealth is tied up in a necessity and its upkeep. Internet access and cell phones have become necessities for most people. Our society is structured around the assumption of these being available. Not having them creates more costs than savings. So they aren\u2019t really added wealth.\n\nWe certainly live longer but the costs of doing so aren\u2019t all that much compared to income except for chronic illness, at least the cost of providing that without profit aren\u2019t that that much. Vaccines are relatively affordable and extremely effective. Fixing a broken arm doesn\u2019t really cost tens of thousands of dollars, it\u2019s true cost is in the hundreds of dollars. \n\nIt\u2019s important to think of wealth in terms of value beyond necessities and their cost to maintain.",

He sold a book and people, out of pure interest, bought it. He didn't have a sweatshop in China stitch the pages or greedily beat out his competition and monopolize the book industry. As far as impact goes, his millions aren't contributing that much to human suffering.\n\nSecond. Bernie is a leftist in a country that's very capitalist. He can't go after millionaires effectively. Instead, he has to go after the most powerful and wealthy group instead, the billionaires. For the pursuit of profit, they have actively made the lives of those around them worse and worse.\n\nThey are leeches in society. They actively try to stop funding into public transit and more broadly, climate change, so that their oil production companies make more profit (Koch Brothers). They force their workers to go through their terrible working condition just so they can squeeze just a little more value from them (Jeff Bezos).  They buy up and steal homes from hard working Americans and then resell and mark up the price (BlackRock). They own news media outlets that poison the minds of the American population with false information (Fox News, Rupert Murdoc). And then everything that has to do with Trump and Elon. If you look at Trump's cabinet, 13 of the 25 members are billionaires.\n\nIf billionaires just enjoyed their lives and wealth and didn't actively try to make the world worse, I wouldn't mind them that much. But it's clear that they will continue to push for more and more profit so that they can continue to enrich themselves. I don't entirely blame them. That's just how companies are. They're profit driven. Or more precisely very large companies rely on always increasing the expectation of profit so that they can maintain investor interest. And so companies always have to become bigger and more powerful if they want to maintain their relevance and stock value. And they will pursue any means, ethical and unethical, and exploit any loophole in the system to do so.",

There are many people who can make those widgets. And there are many factories that make widgets and other contraptions. The factories compete for the laborers by offering compensations. The workers compete for the factories by having skills and work ethic. They come to a mutually beneficial agreement on the rate before the work is commenced. And that rate is based upon the supply and demand for the labor and the goods. This seems fair. Not theft.",

A youtuber who hires a staff that produces videos for the youtuber is a small business owner. The means of production is Youtube itself. The owners of Youtube are the capitalists in this scenario.\n\nIt is technically possible for a worker to transistion to captalist is what I believe you are getting at, and technically this is true. It is vanishingly rare, but it does happen. Oprah and Carnegie are sighted often, and capitalists of course love these stories because they support the narrative of a merit-based society where upward mobility is just some amount of handwork, talent, and gumption away for everyone.\n\nThe actual reality is very different.\n\nActual upward mobility looks a lot more like moving up fractions of a percentage point within the scale of modern economics. Someone may be born to coal miners, and become a local lawyer, an engineer, a small business owner. This appears to be meaningful, and to that individual it is, however on the scale of economics this is also very unusual, and even when it does happen this person rise in the economic structure is tiny. By the time they pass it is excruciatingly unlikely that even their heirs will have any chance of progressing to capitalists.\n\nTransition to capitalist class comes almost exclusively after many multiple generations accrue enough wealth that eventually a descendant is able to transition.

The fact that a worker can transition to capitalist disproves your original assertion that \"you cannot pursue such undertakings without vast amounts of pre-existing wealth.\"\n\nYou were wrong.  You can pursue such undertakings with nothing, as you just agreed.\n\nSince you agree that one can create their own means of production you also agree that people are not \"exploited by the capitalist\" because they have been \"locked out\" of the means of production.  They are not locked out, as you agreed.  Since they are not locked out, they are not forced or coerced into an employment agreement and therefore not being exploited.  They are actively engaging in a free choice.  They can either pursue their own ventures and create their own means of production, or they can agree to work for an agreed upon wage.  That agreement negates perceived exploitation or \"theft\" as you called it.",

The best metric to look at is wealth, because the very rich dont get a salary anymore, they get money from their investments. Its also difficult to look at wealth data from 1970, because the gathering of data started in 1989, and the numbers for 2023 onwards are not out yet, so we take 2022 data.\n\n# GPD and the median\n\nThe GDP in 1989 was 5.65 Trillion US dollars, compared to the GDP of 2022 with 26 Trillion US dollars. Thats an increase of about 460%. (in 1970 it was just 1.073 Trillion, so an increase of 2600% to today).\n\nIf we look at wealth data, the median wealth in 1989 adjusted to 2022 Dollar value is $108,877. The median wealth of 2024 is $192,000. **Thats an increase of about 78%**.\n\n# The rich\n\nIts difficult to find data for the top 0.01%, but the top 1% had 23% of the net worth in the US in 1989 which was approximatley 11.51 Trillion US Dollars, in 2022 the Top 1% had 31% of the net worth in the US, which is 47.07 Trillion US Dollars. These numbers are clear, because its their share of the total money in the US.\n\nThen we can look at the GINI Coefficiant (0 means everyone has exactly the same amount of money, 1 means one single person has all the money, it a simple way to show wealth distribution). In 1989, the GINI Coefficiant was at approximatley 0.382, in 2022 it was at 0.494\n\nThen we can look at the Forbs 400 (the 400 wealthiest individuals) in 1989 had 289 billion US Dollars, which is adjusted to the 2022 Dollar approximatley 625 billion US Dollars. In 2022, the wealthiest 400 had 4.5 Trillion US dollars. The increase is 620%. **However**, in 1982 the first year of Forbs 400, the wealth adjusted to the 2022 Dollar is 294 billion US Dollars, so the increase to 2022 is 1429%\n\n# And now to my estimate of the meme claims themselves (in global terms):\n\n* **700% world wealth increase** \u2192 **Overstated but possible depending on metrics. With GDP its more around 470%**\n* **8% richer average person** \u2192 **Reasonable for global median wealth. Most of the wealth increase is in western countrys, the global south didnt see as much of an increase. The median and mode today is piss poor, because most people on earth are poor.**\n* **4,000% increase for the richest 0.01%** \u2192 **Largely true for the ultra-rich.**\n\n**Tl;dr: The meme compared to US numbers is incorect, or atleast the numbers are not to be found. But the sentiment behind the meme is correct! The median Wealth incresed by approximatley 78% from 1989 to 2022, while the 400 Richest people got an increase of 620% and the top 1% had an increase from 23% of total wealth to 31% of total wealth.**",

People easily get mad at folks for having more than they do, so it's easy to whip up anger.  Converting that anger into something that actually helps the poor (as shown by the USSR and CCP) is a lot harder, and seems a lot less important, because Demagaugery is about personal power (and in the internet era about attention).\n\n  \nThe important thing to look at, and where this lies, is in **how much better or worse are the global poor?

Since 2020, global GDP has increased by a further 17%, bringing the total to 3.6*1.17= 421% GDP growth since 1970. Source: [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD) and [IMF](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO)\n\n* Claim: Average person is only 8% richer. Truth: Per capita GDP rose from $4,500 to $15,000 (2011 international dollars), a 233% jump per Our World in Data. Now, if you're concerned that the per capita figure includes the wealthy and that throws off the data, we can also specifically look at the bottom 50% of income earners globally from that same time period. For them, income in constant 2015 USD jumped from $192 per person to $2,112, an increase of 1,003%, which is an even GREATER increase than the average.

Moreover, the few gains that have been made have virtually all happened in one place: China. It is disingenuous, then, for the likes of Gates and Pinker to claim these gains as victories for Washington-consensus neoliberalism. Take China out of the equation, and the numbers look even worse. Over the four decades since 1981, not only has the number of people in poverty gone up, the proportion of people in poverty has remained stagnant at about 60%. It would be difficult to overstate the suffering that these numbers represent. This is a ringing indictment of our global economic system, which is failing the vast majority of humanity. Our world is richer than ever before, but virtually all of it is being captured by a small elite. Only 5% of all new income from global growth trickles down to the poorest 60% \u2013 and yet they are the people who produce most of the food and goods that the world consumes, toiling away in those factories, plantations and mines to which they were condemned 200 years ago. It is madness \u2013 and no amount of mansplaining from billionaires will be adequate to justify it.*\n\n\u00a0\n\n[*https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/29/bill-gates-davos-global-poverty-infographic-neoliberal*](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/29/bill-gates-davos-global-poverty-infographic-neoliberal)",

I understand where you are going with this, you just got stuck in a keyword but apparently you have nothing to say about what I was saying. Because keywords have to be precise and everything is literal. \n\nJust consider insider trading discussions in US last year, although it raised all of that ruckus in the media a bill has not even come to the senate. Worse, although the insider trading was recorded and all documents were on media, nothing happened to anybody. Many politicians own American style private mansions yet when you check out their tax returns their worth is not even a million. Just consider this, Kamala Harris, according to tax records she and her husband totals around 5 million when she got into serious politics, totally fine number, perfectly understandable, especially if you are born to a middle class family and work through your life. That is some kind of cash you \"can\" make if you are a little lucky. but 2.5 billion in 10 years? and the only explanation is that \"they made good investments\"?   \n\nBy the way, if you want to stuck on numbers and terms, even a billion is not an \"unfathomable number\" nowadays. A decent house in a big european or US city begins from 500k.  If you know anything about finance, you should know the richest persons today dont even rely on money anymore, because finances can be just made out of an endorsements or loans, or collaterals just out of thin air. (Consider elon musk ... gets no salary .. does not directly own the company .. under his leadership all his companies only regressed .. considered one of the richest.) (Consider Elisabeth Holmes .. did not invent anything .. sold vaporware to people .. was worth 4 billion). (Then consider Michael Jordan. Best of the best. Literally made Nike what it is. Has companies, had an NBA team once! Worth what? 500 mil? This is something like the most money one can make by honest living i suppose) (Worse, Harris, by US standards is one of the more honest ones) Do you think these things can happen without backing of some legislative power? without putting some money in some people's pocket? Who is more at fault? grifter or enabler? in my opinion both. \n\n  \nBut of course .. you know so much about finance and politics. Please tell me more.",

The other commenter mentioned labor which is a very valid point, do those inequalities reflect the material conditions of production? No, they do not. \n\nThose inequalities are also not without consequences, a better distribution of wealth worldwide would in all likelihood improve the lives of an overwhelming majority of people.

            "body": "The statement touches on complex issues of global wealth/income growth and inequality. While it captures a real trend of disproportionate gains by the ultra-wealthy, the exact percentages require context and clarification. Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **1. \"The world is 700% richer than in 1970\"**  \n- **Reality**:  \n  - Global GDP (nominal) grew from ~$3.4 trillion in 1970 to ~$105 trillion in 2023\u2014a **3,000% increase** (not 700%).  \n  - Adjusted for inflation and population growth, real per capita GDP increased by **~200%** since 1970.  \n  - The \"700% richer\" claim likely conflates nominal GDP growth with real (inflation-adjusted) metrics, which is misleading.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. \"The average person is only 8% richer\"**  \n- **Reality**:  \n  - **Globally**, extreme poverty fell from 60% in 1970 to ~9% today, and median incomes rose significantly in developing nations (e.g., China, India).  \n  - **In advanced economies**:  \n    - U.S. median household income grew by ~50% since 1970 (adjusted for inflation).  \n    - Wages for the **bottom 50%** in rich countries stagnated due to inequality.  \n  - The \"8% richer\" figure understates progress for billions in Asia/Africa but might reflect stagnation for middle-class workers in the West.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. \"The richest 0.01% are 4,000% richer\"**  \n- **Reality**:  \n  - The top 0.01% (ultra-billionaires) have seen wealth grow **exponentially**. For example:  \n    - In the U.S., the top 0.01%\u2019s share of wealth rose from 7% in 1978 to 15% in 2022.  \n    - Adjusted for inflation, billionaires\u2019 wealth grew by **~6,000%** since 1990 (Forbes data).  \n  - The \"4,000% richer\" claim aligns with wealth gains at the very top, driven by capital gains, tax cuts, and globalization.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. \"Profits/growth will never reach you\"**  \n- **Reality**:  \n  - **Inequality**: The top 1% captured ~38% of global wealth growth since 1995, while the bottom 50% got just 2% (Credit Suisse).  \n  - **Systemic issues**: Wealth concentrates via capital returns (stocks, real estate) outpacing wage growth, tax policies favoring the rich, and corporate monopolies.  \n  - However, **global living standards** (life expectancy, education, technology access) have improved for most people.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways**  \n- **The statement is directionally correct** but uses oversimplified numbers.  \n- **Global growth has been uneven**:  \n  - Massive gains for the ultra-rich (validating the \"4,000%\").  \n  - Stagnation for many in wealthy nations, but significant poverty reduction globally.  \n\n\n\n- **Solutions**: Progressive taxation, labor rights, and policies to curb monopolies could redirect wealth more equitably.  \n\n---\n\n### **Sources**  \n- World Bank (GDP/poverty data).  \n- Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez, Gabriel Zucman (inequality research).  \n- Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report.  \n- Forbes Billionaires List.  \n\nIn short: Yes, the ultra-rich are capturing disproportionate wealth, but the \"700% vs. 8%\" framing mixes apples and oranges. The core critique of inequality, however, holds.\n\n\nMade by Deepseek",

Thanks to Steve Jobs, I have an iPhone or a competitor device that makes my life infinitely easier/better. Most of these Uber-wealthy people created something that we all benefit from. No one robbed anything from me, or you. \nStop pretending we are victims. We live in objectively the best time in history to be alive based on standard of living, even if some things could obviously be better. I choose to be grateful instead of being envious of those that make more than me while pretending to be virtuous.\nIf you think workers are replaceable, then they need to become irreplaceable through skills, experience, or another quality that makes them valuable.",

At least it does not work within the current state of things.\n\nNo one is debating whether we live in the best time, we have the most advanced technology and medicine and we do benefit from that.\n\nHowever, that does not mean that we should stop observing reality.\n\nThis is not a victim's mindset. Just because someone made something useful and people use that thing a lot, doesn't allow the maker of the things to essentially leech benefits from the user base and the community.\n\nLike, it's insane that I'm even having this argument.... Like, dude, the phones we use, the TVs and tech, it all has an insane profit margin. Guess where that profit margin is going, not to the workers, or to the community which is being exploited to garner resources to build these things.\n\nI can have this same debate about the Software economy as well, guess where tht profit margin is going?\n\nI know where the profit margin is going, you know where the profit margin is going. But apparently it's a victim mindset to observe this reality and to call out these billionaires on these exploitative practices?\n\nLike, what? Are you dumb? Or just a propagandist?",

But the research and development (and time/effort) to create those devices was insane. If you think you can do it better, then you should. But I would be willing to bet that you've never started your own business, because you think that owning a business is only about making massive profits. What you fail to recognize is the massive personal risk that business owners take, often while being ridiculed until proven right. Everyone is quick to be mad at the profits that they make, but ignore the 30-40 years it took to get to that point. The original claim is that we are being robbed. And I disagree. Call me whatever names you want, but the more experience I gain, the more I see that business owners that make the most took the most risk to get there.",

What you may not like is that my words have certain thorns of reality.\n\nYes, they did take the risk. This does not justify them to leech from the populace.\n\nThey still take much more, than they give.\n\nIf I ever start a business, I won't shoot up, because I'd be more worried about every worker that I have, about what I can do for them and the community that I'm essentially parasitizing.\n\nIn case this is unclear, let me clarify, businesses have a symbiotic relationship with society.\n\nMostly it's unfair for society, and that's how a business grows fast. In very rare cases, we see that the relationship is balanced, in this case you will see the deep rooted public sentiment of the business as extremely positive, however the business won't really be all that profitable.\n\nAnyway, I don't care enough anymore, I'm not going to engage in this discussion anymore. I can see you are deep set in your ideas, and have a capitalistic mindset, which isn't really the worst thing, in fact, it's more or less ok.\n\nBut I hope you see, how being terminally capitalistic essentially evolves you into a cancer to society.\n\nHave a good day dude, take care, bye.",

I make over 180K a year now.  Thats 1094% increase since I was a kid.  I make 11x what I made only 30 years ago.   I have some college but basically self taught at my profession.   I have completely benefited from the country getting more wealthy that includes many 1%ers sure. Many of the companies I worked for had 1%ers at the top and they made the company so profitable I got yearly bonuses that helped me raise a family and have a lasting career in a profession I love. Thank you 1%ers.  Sorry alot of the 99%ers are too lazy to try to find what they are passionate about and turn it into a living.  I made some poor financial mistakes but Im an \"investing in bitcoin\" early away from being Rich AF.  Also if my entrepreneurial gigs turned out Id be comfortably wealthy...  They didnt happen but Im not sitting here like some candy ash whining about those that made it. Good for them. For the rest of you pissed off what others have can all go fly a kite.  This country is amazing and nothing is perfect!   Get a clue!!!  Wake up!    Unless you a physically disabled, have some mental health crisis or affliction get out of your own way and stop complaining about those who made it to the top.",
