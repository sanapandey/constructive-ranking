            "body": "The balloon is about 1 m in diameter, so that's about 0.5 m3 of H2.\n\nThe pressure inside the balloon is about the same as atmospheric pressure, so if that's 100% pure hydrogen, it would weigh 50 grams.\n\nHydrogen's energy value is about 29 times that of TNT (29 g of TNT is an energetic equivalent of 1 g of hydrogen) so this would be 1,4 kgs of pure TNT.\n\nEdit: this amount of pure H2 would contain about 7 MJ of energy. A stick of dynamite (not TNT) usually seen in movies contains roughly 1 MJ of energy. So that balloon's the equivalent of 7 sticks of dynamite. H2 is pretty potent stuff.",

How much of the room air will be needed for the hydrogen to burn, and how long will the mixing take? \n\nI know that's not simple to model, and it probably won't matter to the people in the room, but I suspect the detonation will be smaller than expected, followed by a conflagration. \n\nI assume the balloon does not contain a stoichiometric ratio of hydrogen and oxygen. In that case, I would retract my comment.",
