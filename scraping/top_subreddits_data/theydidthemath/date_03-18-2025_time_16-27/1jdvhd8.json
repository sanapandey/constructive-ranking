I would think that after 4-6 weeks, the lack of dietary fat would probably become chronic and you would experience insane hormonal imbalances, likely contributing to death in a couple/few months.",

            "body": "The answer to this question really depends on a lot of factors, primarily those being a person's current body composition and nutritional status. Making some assumptions, we get an idea of when certain malnutrition related conditions can occur.\n\nAssuming that the person trying to survive on just these glucose packets weighs 75 kilograms, is 1.82 meters tall, is male, is 25 years old, and is moderately active 3-4 days a week, we can estimate their daily caloric expenditure using the Mifflin St. Jeor formula and an activity factor. Using this, their Basal Metabolic Rate would be (10\\*75kg)+(6.25\\*182cm)-(5\\*25yrs)+5= 1767.5 kcal. To get his daily estimated caloric expenditure, this then can be multiplied by an activity factor, based on his physical activity level we assumed, 1.35\\*1767.5= 2386.125 kcal. This means to survive, they would need to consume 2386.125kcal/106kcal/packet= 22.5 packets per day (from the second picture).\n\nEven though his body has sufficient calories, protein is utilized to for many bodily processes, include the creation of enzymes, cell structures, cellular replication, nutrient transport, etc. This means that his body would need to break down its own muscle mass to provide the necessary amino acids for survival. Estimated protein need for an average person is .8g/kg or 10% of daily calories on the low end. This gives him an estimated need of .8g/kg\\*75kg= 60g protein or .10\\*2386.125kcal/4kcal/g= 59.7 g protein. An average male is about 42% muscle mass, meaning that he would have .42\\*75kg\\*1000g/kg= 31500 g protein available for his body to catabolize. This means his muscle mass would provide sufficient protein for 31500g/60g/day= 525 days. Although, it is worth noting if immune dysfunction, organ failure, or vitamin deficiency didn't lead to his death before this point, kwashiorkor would most likely kill him before all his muscle mass was used up.\n\nFat would be less of a concern during this due to fat mostly only being used for energy stores. Fat soluble vitamins can be stored in and released as fat is used.\n\nWater soluble vitamins would most likely cause a deficiency, specifically Thiamin and Vitamin C have lower stores and half-life times within the body. These vitamins lead to deficiencies like beriberi (Thiamin), Wernicke's encephalopathy (Thiamin), or scurvy (Vit. C). Thiamin would most likely cause a deficiency first due to its low stores in the body, about 25-30 mg. The critical threshold of Thiamin deficiency is around 4mg, which would be met by 3 half lives as 30/2\\^3= 3.75mg. It has a half life of 9-18 days, meaning that stores could fall below critical thresholds within 9days\\*3half lives = 27 days. The development of Beriberi may then lead to cardiovascular disfunction, which would kill him within a few more weeks most likely. So, this person would survive a few months at most.\n\nHowever, it is interesting to note that clinical testing done by the mayo clinic demonstrates marginal Thiamin deficiency at 10 days and severe deficiency within 21 days. Their testing was done with serological levels, which may not be the most reflective of Thiamin stores.\n\nSources:  \n(Protein) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234922/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234922/)  \n(Muscle Mass) [https://www.jefit.com/wp/exercise-tips/facts-about-lean-muscle-and-body-fat/#:\\~:text=The%20Average%20Adult%20Has%20this,in%20men%20and%20women%20respectively](https://www.jefit.com/wp/exercise-tips/facts-about-lean-muscle-and-body-fat/#:~:text=The%20Average%20Adult%20Has%20this,in%20men%20and%20women%20respectively)  \n(Thiamin) [https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/116930-overview?form=fpf](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/116930-overview?form=fpf)  \n(Thiamin) [https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog/overview/42356#Clinical-and-Interpretive](https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog/overview/42356#Clinical-and-Interpretive)",
