Usually sponsors are just that, they sponsor the team to develop and research, in exchange for advertising space. Unless I've understood the economics wrong, in which case, please enlighten me.\n\nAlso next year it will become Audi, with BP and Sky Sports being primary sponsors, again, I could be mistaken, but I have not found any sources online that say Stake/Kick will still sponsor the team then.",
