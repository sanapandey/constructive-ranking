In this case, a 99 % + pure tungsten cube would be worth much more, since a major processing step would have already happened.\n\nIndependent from point 2, I think we can safely assume we are talking > 1 million dollar.",

Assuming that cube is 5 feet tall, 5 feet wide and 5 feet long, and a 12\u00d712\u00d712 inch tungsten cube is around 200 pounds, then my math sayd that cube would weigh about 125,000 pounds...\n\nMy math says 1 foot cube is 200 pounds, 5 feet tall, so 5 of those cubes would be 1,000 pounds, line that up 5 more times and you got the bottom layer being 5,000 pounds, stack upwards for 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, and 25,000 pounds...
