            "body": "I'm mostly just eyeballing the values here, but let's say that tire has a diameter of one meter. The person's head is maybe 75% of the radius from the center, so we'll go with 0.4 meters for the distance from the center of the tire.\n\nIf the tire is rotating at a constant rate, then we can just use the equation for centripetal acceleration: a = r w\\^2, where r is the radius of the circular motion, and w is the rate of rotation of the tire. To produce one g of centripetal acceleration, the tire would be spinning at 5 radians per second or about 50 rpm. This would result in the tire traveling about 2 meters per second, a little faster than walking speed.\n\nAt the end of the video, we can see the other person jogging along side the tire, so it's not moving extremely fast, but it's probably a couple times faster than a brisk walk. Since the speed of the tire is proportional to the rate of rotation and the acceleration is proportional to the rate of rotation squared, I would guess that the person in the tire is getting between 4 and 10 gs, almost certainly less than 20 gs.\n\nBecause of the way the person is oriented in the tire, this acceleration is probably pointing along the person's frontal axis. My understanding that this direction is the one with the highest average tolerance for g-forces, and if [this graph](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Human_linear_acceleration_tolerance.svg#mw-jump-to-license) is to be believed, then its possible that the person in the tire may have temporarily lost consciousness, if the tire was moving on the faster end of these estimates, though the uncertainties in my estimates make it hard to say one way or another.",
