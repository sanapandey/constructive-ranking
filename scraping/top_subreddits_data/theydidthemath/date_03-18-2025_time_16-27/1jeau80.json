Second, let's assume that all humans are randomly spread across all of earth's land area. Third, let's assume that you have to get within 100m of someone to be able to zoom in on them and recognise them. \n\nNow what's the probability that you get a GeoGuesser where you can see any given person? \n\nThis would be (pi \\* 10000m\\^2)/(Earth's land area)\n\nOr 1 in 4740907444. \n\nOf course the actual probability would be a lot lower because humans tend to be concentrated in areas which tend to be farther away from the camera.",
