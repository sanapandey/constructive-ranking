They are one of the biggest names in gaming, in finances, in game scope, in overall industry impact. They make billions of dollars on their titles. They employ tens of thousands of people all over the world to develop, support and create their games. And the larger your company, the slower and more expensive it gets to run, and this includes a game like gta6.

They have more than 2000 employees. Some earn less than $50/hr, but many earn much, much more. $50/hr might not be their actual average salary, but it is a reasonable estimate.  \n  \nSo a number that big really just equates to the fact that it is a very big company, and they let their teams cook. They spend a lot of time to make their games, and GTA is their #1 in their reputation. They aren't going to rush it.  \n  \nCompanies like Activation and EA churn out a lot of games, so it can be tempting for people to think that *all* large gaming corporations are just like that. But it isn't the case. *Some* companies churn out blockbuster games that are repetitive and derivative on a 2 year cycle (CoD Ops Black XVII - Return of the Jarhead). But it can be easy to forget that there are still some companies that take their time on certain franchises - so long as they can support their development with smaller franchises and sales in the meantime. And GTA has been incredibly successful at keeping the income flowing in the long-term, so they don't have a financial need to push the release date. They aren't at risk of running out of money any time soon, so they'll just continue to cook.",
