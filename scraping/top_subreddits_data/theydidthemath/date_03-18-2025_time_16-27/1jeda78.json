            "body": "AI says the following based on giving it a picture of the pieces \n\n\u201cThe number of possible combinations to form a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube using the seven Soma cube pieces is a complex combinatorial problem. The best way to determine this number is through brute-force enumeration or algorithmic approaches rather than a direct mathematical formula. However, I\u2019ll break down the reasoning behind the possible solutions.\n\nStep 1: Understanding the Soma Cube Pieces\n\nThe Soma Cube puzzle consists of 7 polycubic pieces, each made of 3 or 4 small cubes, and together they sum up to a 3\u00d73\u00d73 = 27-unit cube volume.\n\nThe pieces are:\n\t\u2022\t1 piece of 4 cubes (T-shape)\n\t\u2022\t6 pieces of 3 cubes in various configurations\n\nThese pieces can be rotated and flipped, adding to the number of possible placements.\n\nStep 2: Counting the Arrangements\n\nEach piece can be placed in different orientations. In general:\n\t\u2022\tEach piece has multiple possible orientations in 3D space (24 for most pieces, fewer for symmetrical ones).\n\t\u2022\tNot all placements are valid, as they must fit together to form a cube.\n\nSince these calculations require checking every possible placement, it\u2019s best solved computationally.\n\nStep 3: Computational Solution\n\nMathematicians and computer scientists have used brute-force search algorithms to count the valid solutions. The final result, confirmed by exhaustive computational searches, is:\n\n\ufffc\n\nThis means there are 240 ways to assemble the 7 pieces into a perfect cube, considering unique orientations but ignoring reflections or rotations of the whole cube.\n\nStep 4: Why Not a Direct Formula?\n\nSince this is a 3D tiling problem with constraints, there\u2019s no simple combinatorial formula to derive the exact number of solutions. Instead, researchers use backtracking algorithms to systematically place pieces and count valid completions.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile there\u2019s no single equation to determine the number of solutions, the precomputed result of 240 solutions is well-documented and verified computationally. If you\u2019re interested in solving it yourself, I can suggest strategies or even guide you through a solution!\u201d",

Even if the AI was going to make sound analysis after that (which it wasn\u2019t) it doesn\u2019t fundamentally understand the problem space, so it still would\u2019ve generated some answer with errors.\n\nLuckily this is a solved problem with a Wikipedia page and everything, so it knew the answer despite all of the explanation being fluff. \n\nThe important question is did you even read what it wrote?",
