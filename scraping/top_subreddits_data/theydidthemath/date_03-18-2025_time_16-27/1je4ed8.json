Elliptic orbits are elliptical *because* gravity increases as you get closer. Constant acceleration would be some kind of weird slightly-curved-star-pattern effect. \n\nAnd also the Moon would be the least of our concerns, as I don't think we'd survive the Sun falling past us.",

The amount of atmosphere per surface area would stay close enough to the same that the surface would experience nearly the same \"weight of air above\" as current values. Those lightest gases escaping would lower the pressure a smidge, but considering astronauts do fine at 1/3rd Earth pressure, a <10% change in pressure isn't going to spell doom, and O2 concentrations shouldn't change drastically, as O2 is heavier than N2. I would assume atmospheric mixing might make O2 actually have breathable concentrations at *higher* altitudes, meaning summitting Everest would be a LOT easier (but probably still quite hard!).",

Changing that exponential g in the equations just means that the falloff of pressure is going to be gentler with altitude than in a higher g scenario. AKA air will be fluffier.  \n  \nI'm trying to think of what assumptions that pressure equation has that aren't working out....because ultimately, pressure is \"the weight of everything above divided by the area it's affecting,\" and if you've got 98% of the atmosphere, you'd have 98% of the weight, and that paper convinces me we aren't losing half the atmosphere.\n\nWhat occurs to me is that I think the pressure formula is assuming uniform gravity, rather than radial gravity, so rather than a cylinder of gas above the test area, we would be looking at a spherical section, which gets larger at the top than a cylinder, permitting more weight than a cylinder does.\n\n(Off to Wikipedia)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density\\_of\\_air#Variation\\_with\\_altitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_of_air#Variation_with_altitude)\n\nis what we want to read. It looks like the pressure at altitude equation breaks when h=0, as it simplifies to p=p\u2080\\*1\\^(g\\*C) and becomes invariant with g. (C just being a set of constants lumped together).\n\nThe air density equation does a similar thing; it simplifies to being the exact same at altitude 0 regardless of how you change g.\n\nWhat is hard for me to really comprehend well is how the vertical mass distribution changes. My intuition suggests that, like a relaxed spring, the atmosphere will be able to ascend to higher levels. But, since pressure and density are related to temperature, and the temperature gradient between space and the Earth would decrease with a wider buffer between the surface and space, I would expect pressure and density to change less drastically as the atmosphere relaxed...making it less responsive on the whole to the loss of thermal conductivity between dense and less dense shells of air, and suggesting to me that it would relax even further than my 1st order guess would suggest.\n\nBut, I'm leery, this is coming from someone with 3 years of collegiate physics, I'm not an atmospheric physics expert, so I'm not sure which \"constants\" are real and which ones are \"observed constants of convenience\" to simplify the real system into a linear approximation and allow for better predictability.",

Bam, the average density of the planet is now 2.8 g/cc and yeah, a lot is going to change. Here's some notable things that occur to me for this scenario:\n\nAll orbital radii for everything orbiting the Earth must double, so the moon will transition to a radius twice as far away...but it has a lot of inertia, and that change doesn't come instantly unless the magic moment says so, so the moon ends up in a new, very elliptical orbit that *averages* to twice the radius, but is going to ascend higher and then dip back down to 1 lunar orbit radius on a monthly cycle.\n\nThis, plus the reduced forces holding the ocean in place might make the tides go crazy low, relaxing more than they currently do. I think *high tide* would be similar, though, when the moon reaches perigee.\n\nFinely balanced human structures could rupture as tension forces suddenly aren't in equilibrium with weight, BUT I think big bridges would often survive, as they have a safety factor high enough to handle halving their weight.\n\nA lot of buildings that are barely holding together would suddenly be safe for dwelling again.\n\nNew construction would be cheaper, requiring less material, less energy to transport material.\n\nSome earthquakes would occur as rock rebounds near mountain ranges, glacial sheets, the Amazon River and other large \"heavy things pressing down\" on continental crust.\n\nEDIT: MORE earthquakes would appear as the entire Earth rings like a steel gong, having a [similar bulk modulus to steel](https://scholarworks.uni.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6080&context=pias) releasing something like 10\u00b9\u2077 Joules of energy as a very loose ballpark...but spread over every square meter of earth, I don't think this contributes much to structural collapse. It would, however, create a sound that would rumble around for something like a week.\n\nGetting to space would be 75% cheaper per unit mass, except for all the new crazy elliptical orbits of our satellites causing years of recalculating safe orbital spaces (and that would be expensive to do).\n\nSpeed limits for automobiles would need to be lowered, as weight is linked to traction; you would be in a tough spot going around corners and skidding, because your tires are suddenly only half as \"sticky\" as they were.\n\nWhen you walk, you'd have to lean farther forward.\n\nAir travel would be cheaper, the current airplanes would fly just fine, but electric aircraft would soon replace them, as range would increase quite nicely (weight is correlated with drag, so lowered weight means lowered drag means energy goes further).\n\nHuman health \\*could\\* improve, but our hearts are calibrated quite closely to 9.8 m/s/s. The offset in heaviness could help the obese, but heart arrythmia could escalate in folks in lower BMI ranges.  We could see a lot more Radon in the lower atmosphere, as it would have an easier time getting jostled higher into the air.  Climate change would be pretty substantial, too, as while the atmosphere stretches vertically, a lot of that density change would cause the atmosphere to suck up more water vapor, which is a greenhouse gas. We'd have bigger storms, more vigorous thermal mixing, while at the same time probably growing the ice caps.\n\nDepending on what you did with the Earth's core, our magnetic field and thus radiation belts would change, and thus harmful radiation from the Sun probably goes up.\n\nEarth's gravitationally affected asteroids would fall toward the Sun, which *sounds* nice, but would mean they pick up speed and enter more of an elliptical orbit, so you might actually see more potential asteroid collisions due to an increased rate of crossing Earth's orbit. I doubt this effect would be huge, but certainly, we'd have to run all asteroid calculations again to reassess the new risks.\n\nSo...it's not all positive, but there are a lot of \"maybe not so bad\" outcomes.",

Since the Sun is 330,000 times more massive than the Earth, and the current Sun-Earth perturbation period is roughly 6 months, Earth's orbital radius might vary by by .0003% (up to a \u00b10.06% radiation change) and the frequency would roughly double, as our initial change put us roughly 1/4 further around our orbit in effect.\n\nFunny enough, this ought to be about the same size of an effect as the current Milankovitch cycles.

I think *high tide* would be similar, though, when the moon reaches perigee.\n\nYou seem to be making some incorrect assumptions about how tides work: \n\nFirst off, they're caused by the Earth. Sure, how we interact with the Moon and Sun is involved, but the reason most places get two tidal cycles a day rather than two a month (or year) is because it's the Earth's rotation that swishes them around, so to speak. \n\nSecond, both high and low tides are extremes, with mean sea level being what pushing the Moon further away would result in. \n\nThird, the Sun is also involved. Right now, the Sun's influence on tides is about half that of the Moon (or less roughly, it's a 69/31 split). If the Moon entirely disappeared, we'd still get the 31% tides caused by the Sun - which is barely any less than the neap tides we get when the Sun's tides destructively interfere with the Moon's tides. \n\nFourth, depending on exactly where the Moon's perigee ended up, it might end up either cancelling out or reinforcing the tides caused by the Sun in the same way the Sun currently (partly) cancels out or reinforces the Moon's tides. \n\n>Getting to space would be 75% cheaper per unit mass, except for all the new crazy elliptical orbits of our satellites causing years of recalculating safe orbital spaces (and that would be expensive to do).\n\nThat, and space would be twice as far away. \n\nThat is, unless you also remove 48% of the atmosphere's mass, in which case we'd all die of hypoxia making the rest of your comment rather irrelevant. Or reduce the average temperature of the atmosphere to 130 kelvin, in which case we'd all die of hypothermia, making the rest of your comment rather irrelevant. \n\n>the current airplanes would fly just fine,\n\nWhile technically true, they'd no longer be able to take off from or land at most airports until we lengthened the runways by a lot. \n\n>Earth's gravitationally affected asteroids would fall toward the Sun,\n\nI have no idea where this idea comes from.

Also a great point on decreased lift and thrust at takeoff for airplanes.\n\nAs for the asteroids, I was thinking about first, asteroids at the Earth-Sun LaGrangian points. The Earth's gravity is responsible for how \"flat\" that part of space is, gravitationally speaking, and if you suddenly drop the Earth's mass by 48%, it's akin to one side of a tug-of-war letting go. When that happens the body will accelerate sunward, gain speed, and thus increase its eccentricity. This will be enough to get it away from L4 and L5, and cause it to become an Earth-Crossing asteroid.\n\nI realized after that that this effect would really affect all of Earth's quasi-satellites, so they are all going to gain some speed and eccentricity, and the new gravitational equilibrium will try to reset them (a bit) and offer some gravitational friction, aka \"acceleration toward the Earth.\"\n\nAs to the timescale of this sort of thing, I'd have to defer to the astrophysicists.",

That is, the force you put into the jump is the same force you have to put to brace yourself on landing, just in the opposite direction.\n\nWhen you consider that we can land safely from significantly higher heights than we can jump to, you see why you could never hurt yourself jumping, unless you didn't land correctly.",
