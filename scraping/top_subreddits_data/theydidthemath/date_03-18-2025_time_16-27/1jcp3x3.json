So $9.60 per litre. \n\nSo for $16 billion you can make a sphere 1.6 billion litres. So a sphere about 145 meters tall. \n\nObviously this doesn't include, shipping, manufacturing, etc. \n\nFor comparison the tallest building in San Francisco is 325 m tall. \n\nSo the short answer is no.\n\n\nEDIT: for everyone suggesting that it be hollow, that's ridiculous. The resonance of the ominous hum would be ruined. Not to mention ruining the obvious economic benefits.",

As the Colossus of Rhodes was 32 metres tall (according to Wikipedia), I think that 145 metres would qualify, though the picture is exaggerating a lot. My main issue would be that it would not be visible throughout Northern California:\n\nGoogle says the formula for visibility over the horizon is roughly 2.08*(rt(h)+rt(H)), where H and h are the heights of the two objects (the sphere and the observer) in metres, and it gives the answer in miles, which means the sphere would only be visible from within about 30 miles, much less than the about 200 miles to the north of California. Reversing the calculation, it would have to be about 9000m tall to be visible from there, also mostly hollow given the amount of material available. (That would definitely collapse under its own weight)\n\nAlso, the lack of ominous hum. Without that, what would be the point?",

If melting is ok, can you produce obsidian from sand and other silicates?  Never have i seen any calculation of manufacturing cost. \n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s unclear how spending billions of dollars on volcanic glass would have a significant economic impact compared to military spending. Lastly, i am not convinced that it would hum at all. \n\nIn short, the funding in the post would not be sufficient to create a sphere as shown in the image. The sphere wouldn\u2019t float nor hum. The economic impact would be marginal at best. It\u2019s not clear what is meant by construct, so it may not even be possible.",

With any glass object, you need to cool it uniformly or the outside will shrink against the still warm core and crack.   Currently, ceramic molds are used, but an object of this size would likely take months or years to cool. I don\u2019t have the experience to tell you if a ceramic could withstand high temps for that long. It might be possible to do it in space, but there is still a risk of cracking.",
