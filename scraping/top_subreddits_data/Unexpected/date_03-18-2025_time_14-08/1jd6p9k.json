Like if you saw it on a list of famous movie quotes, the \"no\" might stick out as odd. What is he saying no to? Y'know? Plus \"Luke\" would help better contextualize it.\n\nSorta like \"Play it again, Sam,\" a famous (non-existent) line from Casablanca. He says \"Play it again\" a few times, and refers to Sam by name a few times, but never together. But if \"Sam\" were in the line/quote, it would \"work\" better in a way. You paint \"Play it again, Sam\" on a wooden wall decoration or other chachky and people will recognize it as from Casablanca, while \"Play it again\" on its own seems more ambiguous.",

Mid-budget comedies really hit their stride from the late 80's right up to about 2010. A better argument would have been \"last 10 years\" because then we see the consolidation of directors/actore/producers/studios putting these out.\n\nI wonder the number of mid budget comedies since 2015 that does not have any of the following: The Rock, Kevin Hart, Melissa McCarthy, Ryan Reynolds, Phil Lord & Christopher Miller, or Superheroes.\n\nThe biggest thing I've noticed is how most recent popular comedies should also be considered a different genre. Many of them are superhero/police/action movies that also have jokes. I keep checking lists of the \"best comedies\" since 2015 and they always contain Shazaam and/or Deadpool. Both franchises where the comedy is secondary to the plot/stakes of the film.",

Back when I was in like 5th grade my dad let me have his old PS2 so I took it upstairs and hooked it up to my tv (a little princess themed tv that only connected to cable or those joystick games) and I had no clue how to work it, but someone had used it last to watch scary movie 2 and forgot to take the DVD out\u2026 I spent the next 2-3 years watching it at least once a day. No clue why I never grabbed another DVD to watch but it still holds a special place in my heart lol. I think it formed my humor entirely and certain moments in that movie (when shorty gets smoked by a joint, take my strong hand, etc) were just the epitome of humor to me and even though that was 17 years ago a little part of me still fully agrees that nothing is as funny as scary movie 2",
