Bigger dangers are you have no idea how deep it is. It may seem like it's 50 ft deep or it could be 2 in deep. A lot of times there is sharp metal objects sticking up or sharp boulders. I've seen videos of cars and cranes at the bottom abandoned or fell in. He could be impaled and die instantly, especially at that height. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/mupBATAz5mw",

Probably a copper lead complex - both in soluble forms, so you\u2019re kidneys and your brain will get a big dose of heavy metal poisons, which can lead to organ failure and or affect your brain function permanently (because your body never gives up heavy metals - just ask the blue man group (jk, just the blue man))",
