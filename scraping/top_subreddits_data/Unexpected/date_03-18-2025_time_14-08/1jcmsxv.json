The British are not idiots, there would have been a significant number of snake bite deaths in these local populations before they arrived, and there would have been local efforts to purge snakes either way. You don't \"co-exist\" with snakes, you survive them.\n\n\nThe Brits provided an incentive and the technology to surpass the risk of snake removal and the Indians proved they could not be trusted with schemes that would work in the West. This isn't happening with boars in the USA right now and it isn't happening with snake removers in Florida and Australia. Only a country of backwards people would take advantage of a safety scheme meant to make themselves safer.",

Most of the time if you don't really bother a snake, even the venomous ones, they'll leave you alone. My mom encountered two separate cobras on two separate occasions, the same species as the one in the video and she just stood petrified out of fear. Both the snakes had their hoods out and stood in a threatening position, but when the snakes realised that she's no harm, they slithered away. Btw, cobras can strike someone within 12ft of where they are standing and they assume that threatening position when they are within that striking distance. Suffice to say that on both occasions, she was standing within the striking distance.\n\nMost of the time even the local villagers keep their distance from the snakes because they know that if they harm the snakes then there will be a sudden influx of rats which will in turn feed on their grain stores. And in case they think that the snakes are too much of a problem then they bring in the mongoose.",
