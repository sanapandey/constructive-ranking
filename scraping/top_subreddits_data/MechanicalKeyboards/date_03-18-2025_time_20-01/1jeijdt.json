    "selftext": "One off boards I\u2019ve designed for myself since my last post on this topic about a year and a half ago. \n\nSpent this year working on more standard Alice boards, but developed custom MX PCBs to support plateless tadpole mount and spent some time learning EC PCB design to get my own EC PCB working (thank you Cipulot). Plateless tadpole has ended up being my favorite mounting style, with a unique sound and feel that I really enjoy.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten to the point now where the only boards I buy anymore are ones I design myself, which is much more fulfilling to me.\n\nRed Celestial Mars with Cherry Ergo Clears and GMK Red Alert (Plateless with 90A tadpoles)\nBlue Tidal v1 with HMX Xinhais and GMK Blue Alert (Plateless with 50A tadpoles)\nSilver lacuna with 35g Deskeys Carrots and GMK WoB/GMK Taiga",
