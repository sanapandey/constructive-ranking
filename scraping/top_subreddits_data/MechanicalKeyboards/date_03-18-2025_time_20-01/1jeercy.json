    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I am Aregs.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhether you are one of our consumers or an enthusiast who didn't join the group buy, many of you have likely heard about us through the grapevine. Over the past year, due to betrayal and unreasonable actions from the factory, as well as my own procrastination and lack of transparency in handling the situation, what could have been a promising project was repeatedly delayed. Eventually, it led to widespread criticism due to delays and refund issues. Personally, I lost between 500,000 to 1,000,000 RMB on this project, along with a year's worth of time. Although 90% of the players were satisfied with the product, a one-year delivery time is ultimately unacceptable and intolerable for consumers. Many who joined the group buy later summarized it as: \"The product is good, but the year-long wait has long since killed the excitement in consumers' hearts.\"\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo this, I first offer my sincerest apologies to all who joined chinese group buy. In this post, I will detail the pitfalls I encountered in the supply chain over the past year, hoping to shed light on what exactly happened in this major drama from last year. More on that later.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter several days of consideration, some advised me not to post this, thinking most people wouldn't understand. However, I still want to give everyone an explanation.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\*\\*Btw:\\*\\* By the end of 2024, before the 2025 New Year, we have shipped all orders\u00a0for chinese gb, including three keyboards and five types of switches.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\---\n\n\u00a0\n\n**The story begins in 2023. In August 2023**, we came up with the idea of creating a special kit\u2014not just a single keyboard or kit, but a bundle aimed at newcomers to the custom keyboard hobby. The goal was to provide a more convenient, comprehensive, and affordable way for new players to experience the fun of the custom keyboard community. So, we brought in a designer and a well-known veteran in the keyboard community(he called Lu Xun, Intermediary for contacting manufacturers, also is the manufacturer and designer for molly60 v1 ),\u00a0along with his factory,\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe factory owner, Zhen, invested and partnered with us. I was the project initiator, Lu Xun\u00a0was the middleman and production manager, and we had a designer. With that, the project began.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**In October 2023**, we finalized the designs for three keyboards and five types of switches and started prototyping. We produced 25 sets prototypes(each set included three keyboards and 1,000 switches of each type).\n\n\u00a0\n\nBy December 2023, the switch prototypes were completed and passed inspection. Lu Xun\u00a0took two months to finish the 25 sets of keyboard prototypes (initially, it was supposed to take one month). However, due to design issues (the designer is to blame), the prototypes couldn't function properly, so we had to rework them.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Around January 20, 2024**, after about a month and a half, Lu Xun's factory (managed by Zhen( Plant manager of the manufacturer)) completed the rework. But after anodizing, we were shocked and disappointed to find that, strictly speaking, the QC pass rate was 0%. Even by the lowest standards in the keyboard community, the pass rate was only 4% (1 out of 25). This was especially true for the Alice keyboard. This is why, out of the 25 prototypes, only one video review was posted on Bilibili by a user named Maizi Chao\u2014that was the one passable sample. The main issues were uneven edges and burrs on most prototype. While these issues are somewhat acceptable in prototypes (since the point is to identify and fix problems before mass production), what was unacceptable was the presence of material streaks, which couldn't be resolved by polishing, re-anodizing, or re-CNCing. These streaks resulted in uneven surfaces with visible dark and light areas, something even a 15\u00a0RMB tray-mounted keyboard wouldn't have. This was unacceptable. I invested around 15000\u00a0USD\u00a0in these 25 prototypes, and Lu Xun\u00a0neither returned the money nor deducted it from the mass production costs, resulting in a huge loss. Due to financial constraints, we couldn't wait another two months to refine the product further, so we decided to proceed with the one passable sample for the group buy. Our plan was to use the early bird group buy funds to purchase specialized aluminum materials for mass production, solve the issues, and then produce 10 new prototypes for promotional purposes. Just as we thought things were turning around, the most outrageous event unfolded.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**At the end of January 2024,**\u00a0the Chinese early bird group buy launched and ended a week later. We received partial upfront payments from the XWJ platform for production. A few days before the Chinese New Year, I transferred 20735USD\u00a0to Lu Xun, who was in charge of production, as a 50% deposit for mold opening and CNC processing, hoping production would start immediately after the holiday. **The drama began about a month and a half later.**\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jricrn6l9ipe1.jpg?width=725&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c7012693ed04d12871d806a2cc8ff86de9ed266\n\n\u00a0\n\n**In March 2024**, after the long holiday, I returned to Dongguan to follow up on production. To my surprise, Lu Xun\u00a0informed me: \"In 2023, Lu Xun\u00a0produced molly60 keyboard at the factory, and i as the overseas main vendor, I sold nearly 1,000 units, accounting for 95% of the total production\u00a0number. However, during delivery, the factory suddenly raised prices, so Lu Xun\u00a0hadn't settled the final payment for the molly60 project. The 20735 USD\u00a0I transferred to Lu Xun\u00a0was forwarded to the factory, but the factory unilaterally decided to use it to cover Lu Xun' s outstanding debt for the molly60\u00a0project.\" I was shocked. This meant the money intended for Kyubi production was gone. Lu Xun\u00a0then said, \"Don't ask the factory about this. There's no need to confront them. I'll handle it; you don't need to worry.\" Looking back, this was already suspicious, but I was too naive and new to the industry. I trusted Lu Xun\u00a0and let him handle it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**But things were far from simple. Lu Xun\u00a0and the factory had different stories, which I'll mention later.**\n\n\u00a0\n\n**In April 2024**, after a month of negotiations and waiting, Lu Xun\u00a0told me he couldn't resolve the issue but suggested we start prototyping new samples and aim to launch the official Kyubi group buy in May. This way, we could recoup some funds and have money for production. I agreed. (This was my fault. I'm a prideful person and didn't confront Lu Xun\u00a0or ask the factory about the 20735 USD. Everyone remained polite, and as the project leader, I lacked the management experience and supply chain control skills to handle this properly. Looking back, I should have clarified the 20735 USD\u00a0issue and sought legal recourse. Even if I couldn't recover the money immediately, I could have sought financial help from family or friends to avoid delaying production. This was both Lu Xun\u00a0and the factory's extreme irresponsibility and my own immaturity as a project leader.)\n\n\u00a0\n\n**By May 2024**, it was supposed to be the delivery time for the early bird group buy, but we hadn't even started production. Since Lu Xun\u00a0was in the early bird group chat, and everyone knew him, I chose to hide the truth from consumers, saying production was underway but there were some issues, so delivery would be delayed until August. This was based on the assumption that the official group buy would launch in June, with two months of production time, allowing us to ship both the early bird and official group buys in August. We planned to offer compensation for the delay, hoping consumers would understand. Indeed, after the first delay, most consumers in the group were tolerant due to the compensation. But I still trusted Lu Xun\u00a0and didn't ask the factory about the 20735 USD.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ke3xe6vo9ipe1.jpg?width=679&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3bf8a7ee47edb0bd895a54b1260650ccd127cd06\n\n\u00a0\n\nHere, I bow my head in sincere and remorseful apology to everyone\u00a0that joined the chinese gb. I failed to fulfill my responsibilities as a group buy organizer to ensure transparency and accountability to consumers. I blindly believed in my ability to solve problems and was overly optimistic, leading to this tragedy. Everyone has faced pitfalls, and while 20735 USD\u00a0is a significant amount, I am the one who should be accountable to the consumers.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs one group member who later learned the truth said, \"If you had told everyone earlier, no one would have been upset. Instead, they would have offered advice and solutions.\" Looking back, I deeply regret my actions. I am sorry.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBy the end of June 2024, the Chinese official group buy launched and ended, but sales were disappointing\u2014only 100 sets. The funds from the XWJ platform weren't enough to start production, and we were in a deep financial crisis. After six months of team operations with little income, we were struggling to make ends meet. We decided to start production of the 75% and numpad kits and switches first, hoping to launch an overseas group buy to recoup funds and then start Alice production. We anticipated another delay for the Alice kit until early September, but thought consumers wouldn't mind too much since the 75%, numpad, and switches would be ready by then. I agreed to this plan, but in hindsight, if I had sought financial help from my family to complete the Alice kit before the second delay, the group buy could have been considered successful, as consumers were very tolerant after the first delay.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\\*\\*PS:\\*\\* When we were about to start production of the 75% and numpad kits, Lu Xun\u00a0and the factory suddenly raised prices by nearly 15% without any design changes. With our profit margin already below 20%, and this being a budget-friendly kit, this was unacceptable. Due to Lu Xun's subpar production quality, we chose another reputable factory that had worked with several well-known brands in the community.\u00a0This is also why, after everyone received our products, they said the product quality was very good.**\n\n\u00a0\n\n**By the end of July 2024,** we completed production of the 75% and numpad kits and started shipping them along with the switches. We also announced a staggered shipping schedule. At this point, some dissatisfaction emerged, but it wasn't severe. Consumers who received the 75% kits and switches gave positive feedback, though there were some packaging issues and damages, which we addressed with replacements.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**In early August 2024,** another factory-related issue arose. We needed to produce tri-mode PCBs, but the manufacturer, after receiving a 30,000 RMB deposit, refused to produce them due to low order quantities and also refused to refund the deposit, calling it a \"design fee.\" The manufacturer, a well-known three-letter company starting with \"H,\" left us with no choice but to cancel all tri-mode orders and refund the price difference. We are now preparing for legal action, as we've been busy with deliveries.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**In mid-August 2024,**\u00a0after four months of foolish trust, with my parents'\u00a0intervention, I finally couldn't take it anymore and asked the factory about the 20735 USD. I recorded the conversation for evidence, but the response was even more disappointing: the factory stated that the price increase and the claim that Lu Xun\u00a0owed them money were entirely false. The factory hadn't raised prices; Lu Xun\u00a0simply hadn't paid the final payment. When Lu Xun\u00a0forwarded my Kyubi funds to the factory, they used it to cover his debt. As Lu Xun's overseas main vendor for the molly60\u00a0project, I had contributed 1,000 overseas orders, paying 50% upfront and the remaining 50% before shipment. According to the factory's evidence, Lu Xun\u00a0did forward my deposit to the factory, but when I paid the final 50%, he didn't forward the full amount. This was somewhat understandable because, given the large volume of overseas sales, Lu Xun\u00a0offered me a very competitive price, leaving little profit. Combined with his poor financial planning habits\u2014always robbing Peter to pay Paul\u2014I suspect he had already spent the profits and overdrawn funds before I paid the final 50%, leaving him unable to pay the factory and resulting in my Kyubi funds being used to cover his debt.\n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/izpefk9r9ipe1.jpg?width=1283&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44e7efde41a75d82b09f59953f519c168b9a4aaf\n\n**In September 2024,**\u00a0an unexpected issue arose with the overseas group buy vendor, and we couldn't launch the overseas group buy as planned. This left us with no funds, and the team's financial gap widened further. We couldn't afford to produce the Alice kit, so I finally swallowed my pride and sought help from my family, allowing us to start Alice production.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**By the end of October 2024,** most of the Alice kits were completed and began shipping. Within a month, we shipped 90% of the orders. The remaining orders were for painted and 7-degree kits, which we couldn't deliver as the factory refused to continue production. We canceled the 7-degree kits and refunded everyone (the 7-degree kit remains a regret for us).\n\n\u00a0\n\n**In January 2025,**\u00a0Kyubi shipments were mostly completed, marking the end of the Kyubi saga. During this time, Lu Xun\u00a0had been slowly repaying me through earnings from other projects, and the debt was mostly settled. I didn't pursue it further.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\---\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Finally,**\u00a0I offer my deepest apologies to all Kyubi group buy participants. Due to the many pitfalls I encountered with the factory and my own lack of experience in project management, the failure was 50% due to external factors and 50% due to my own shortcomings. Consumers had to bear the consequences of the delays, and I deeply regret my actions over the past year. I've learned a lot, and at the end of this post, I hope to gain some understanding from everyone. I've tried to explain the situation as clearly as possible, and this is my final account of the matter.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, if there are any unprocessed orders, please message me on QQ, and I will handle them as soon as possible. If I miss your message, please send it again. Thank you.\n\nRegardless, last year, Nlandkeys' overseas management was also not up to par. Before Rob joined, our group buys and shipping efficiency were a complete mess, and this was my fault. To a large extent, it was because Kyubi drained me mentally and physically, consuming almost 90% of my energy. Here, I also want to apologize to all friends who had a poor shopping experience with Nlandkeys. In the new year, we will do our absolute best to improve. Thank you all for your understanding.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ca5ee51bipe1.jpg?width=725&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9778342d415f97d54b7dd0db096e062aa21abf98\n\n",
