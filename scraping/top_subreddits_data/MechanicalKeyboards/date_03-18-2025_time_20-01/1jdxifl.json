However, I'm not the biggest fan of my current switch I initially bought them because they were dirt cheap and ended up kind of regretting it because they felt super light.\n\n\nAfter a couple years I sorta got used to them and they're solid switch but personally im looking for something heavier with a more prominent tactile bump as these switches barely feel tactile to me. I scoured AliExpress and was thinking of getting boba u4t because those were popular some time ago but what im hearing now is that they're kind of old news now heard some some people also say mx black is good but idk I've heard bad things about cherry switches. Also are kailh Box switches still good and are their any cheap alternatives to zealios v2 nowdays?",

My recommendation would be to order some single switches and a switch tester and just try some stuff out. \n\nHeavy linears are probably a good starting point, but I do think some more \"rounded\" tactile switches where the tactile bump isn't super sharp might also work. Off the top of my head, I can think of Durock Ceruleans/Cherry MX Ergo Clears, those might be up your alley. You might also wanna try Akko Creamy Purple Pros; they're a lighter tactile but with super short travel, so the feel is very \"bouncy\", in a way. They're very fun! \n\nI'd suggest having a look at milktooth.com, they have lots of different switches and very helpful filters in the store. \n\nHope that helps!",

And like said, their keycaps/backlighting is one of the worst implementations on the market, sadly. I love their keyboard, I love the aesthetics, but the lights are *awful*. \n\nMany, MANY manufacturers do great pink keyboards, but they don't come in Nordic layouts for some reason \u2014 even if the rest of the manufacturer's catalogue is available in Nordic\n.

I'm also thinking of moving from a red switch to a brown (or similar) as I miss the classic tactile feedback I've had in a blue-switch and vintage PS/2 keyboards.\n\nI'm playing on AliExpress and I can't quite find what I want. The Epomaker RT100 is close, but I want TKL as I have no use for a number pad. Also, I'm not sure what switches they have. The EPO P75 is close, too, but seems to be ANSI only and not ISO. Same with the Ajazz AK820.\n\nAt this point with the combo of features I want, I think I'll have to custom build one.\n\n1. 75%/TKL w/ Fkeys & pgup/pgdn\n2. Wired/wireless I don't care\n3. Volume knob would be very slick\n4. ISO/UK layout\n5. brown switches (or similar; I haven't RTFM/STFA on all the different cream/panda/hybrid stuff that I know exists. Happy to take suggestions)\n6. No need for RGB.\n7. Sourcing is not limited to AliExpress, but given I'm in the UK and I don't want to pay a premium for Drop or any of the other retailers, that's where I'm headed unless you have other suggestions.\n8. Colours of the keyboard base/surround don't need to be crazy or garish; basic beige, black, etc. Don't need pastel or fluorescent. I already have my PBT keycaps I can re-use.\n9. Ideally I don't want a cheap plastic surround; I want something metal and heavy.\n\nCan anyone point me in the right direction? Thank you!",

                    "body": "\"keyboard are the normal ones\" - what does that mean? Mechanical/ MX is pretty much the standard for keyboards since membrane/ ... is not standardized.\n\n\"Keyboard mold\" - so you got the molds for the Keycaps already and are just looking for the keyboard now? What about the PCB/ plate/ switches/ ...?\n\nWe would need more information to entertain your questions/ thought process. Sorry to say but this seems like you are severely underestimating the process going into product design/ ... I'd do some further research and then post a more detailed question :) Good luck!",
