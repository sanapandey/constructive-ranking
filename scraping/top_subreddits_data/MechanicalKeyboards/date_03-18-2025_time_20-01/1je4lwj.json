The colourful ones only came in a 65% layout so I 'padded it out' with a different b&w set.\n\nBoard is a Epomaker x Skyloong GK75 with Gateron Optical Yellow Switches. It's slightly translucent and has a light blue backlight (tried to capture this in the last image) which I personally really like.",
