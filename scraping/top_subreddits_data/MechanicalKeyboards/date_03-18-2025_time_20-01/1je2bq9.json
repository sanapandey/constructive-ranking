    "selftext": "This is a Yunzii B68 with Cocoa Cream V2 Switches and a Kzzi K20 (not fully sure of the switches as it wasn't detailed but the case says Jerrzi and is a purple switch). Keycaps from Amazon.\n\nI actually bought some Matcha Latte V2s to try in the numpad as my first foray into any form of customisation, but I preferred the switches it came with. I may get more of the Matcha Lattes and put these in the keyboard but undecided as of now.\n\nKeyboard will go to my office but numpad will come and go which is why I went separate. So thrilled the body colour matches so well!",

I've copied a para from someone else's Amazon review that I found useful too!\n\nI dont see it mentioned in the packaging or prouduct page but this device has drivers under kzzi.com > downloads, this lets you rebind keys and change the colours to static, it also has full RGB function which is nice. Comes with a USB dongle and fits away nicely. The settings also save to the device so the software doesnt need to be running. Even razer doesnt do that so you are forced to use bloatware.",
