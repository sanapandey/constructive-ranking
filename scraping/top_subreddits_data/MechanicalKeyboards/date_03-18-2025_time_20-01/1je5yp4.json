I put lubed Akko matcha latte switches and the keycaps were from amazon. \nLove this keyboard since it\u2019s my first build but I am getting a little bored with the my current keycaps. These are double shot abs keycaps and they do sound pretty nice so I\u2019m looking for something that will have that deep thock. Since this is white, Im open to anything. If you guys have any cool keycap suggestions, let me know in the comments!",
