    "selftext": "This is my first keyboard build. Wanted something with a Vintage style to it. I love the muted-grey that older keyboards have. I tried to find a pre-built one, but I didn't find anything that I liked. So, I started looking at older keyboards to rebuild and ended up falling in love with the Apple Extended Keyboard II. \n\nTo do this, I rebuilt the PCB to make it compatible with modern-day computers. Really glad how it turned out for my first build. Took me over 8 months from start to finish as I had to learn everything from scratch. I hope you like it!\n\nComponents  \nCase- Apple Extended Keyboard II   \nPCB- custom one I made   \nMicrocontroller- 0xCB Helios   \nKey switches- alps white   \nKeycaps- the ones that come with the Apple Extended Keyboard II",
