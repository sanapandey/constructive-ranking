I'm currently using a Ducky One2 SF with Cherry MX Blue's, and I'm over the clicky. I figured it was time to finally build something myself. I have narrowed down the switches I'd like to try. Keebz N Cables x BSUN Taro N Sweet Potato Linear Switches. From a few videos I've seen, the builds using these switches have a deep, \"thocky\" sound, and that is what I'm ultimately going for. I'm open to other suggestions for switches as well. What I haven't narrowed down is the case and the keycaps. I can go with or without rgb for the case. Let's say around $100 max for the case. I do like white keyboards, but I'm open to whatever suggestions you have, regardless of color. I've read different opinions on metals vs. plastics for case material, but I dont know which truly is better for a deeper sound. I would prefer a 65% because im used to it at this point. I was reading about pbt keycaps and how I should be looking for dense ones. I will be getting ceramic caps down the road, but for now, I would like to go with something in the plastic department, preferably nothing really tall. Any helpful information, including mods to deepen the sound, would be awesome!",

The first mechanical keyboard I owned failed just after reaching the one year mark. Coincidentally just outside the warranty period. Now given this was a cheap keyboard of around 30 USD, I thought that it was gonna die sooner rather than later. After that I bought the HyperX alloy origins core. I had hopes that this would last me like 5-6 years or more. But now just after 2 years, again coincidentally outside the warranty period, the keyboard has started acting up. Some keys work only like 9 times out of 10. This leads me to keep pressing the button 2 times for it to register once. Now given that dust builds up quickly in my room. Like in 1 week you can see thin layer of dust on keyboard. Are mechanical keyboards really not built to last ?\n\nNow given I don't clean the keyboard every week, I still clean it monthly once and clean the keycaps with soap in like every 6 months. So is this just poor maintenance, my bad luck or just generally what happens with mechanical keyboards ? If this is a common thing in mechanical keyboards, I'd rather not invest in higher end mechanical keyboards if they're only gonna last 2-3 years. Hell a shitty membrane one survived over 10 years in my childhood.\n\nP.S-> Any help fixing my issue would also be appreciated.",

                    "body": "I would urge you to get a medical diagnosis from your doctor and seek physical therapy if recommended. PT will give you stretching and strengthening exercises to alleviate the symptoms of RSI and help avoid injuries in the future. Physical therapy really made a long term impact for me, and I am a big proponent for it.\n\nYou may benefit from a split keyboard, or your physical therapist may recommend some other change.\n\nThe Corne has a learning curve, so there is a time investment to become proficient it. It is a 40% keyboard, so it is missing a dedicated number row, and you will need to rely on combos and layers to access missing keys.\n\nFor example, I have the following combos:\n\n* K+L emits Enter\n* J+K emits Backspace\n* D+F emits Del\n* Q+W emits Esc\n\nOn a QWERTY keyboard most of these keys are on the home row, so I do not need to move my hand to reach them. They are also not letters that you are likely to type together in a word, which reduces misfires. L+K is the only exception, but in practice, typing words like \"walk\" do not accidentally send Enter. If it is a problem for you, you can always use a different combination like J+L.\n\nWhen I had a Corne, I mapped a layer key that I could easily reach with my right thumb. It activated a layer with the number row on my home row (A is 1, S is 2, D is 3, and so on), and the row above is my shifted number row (Q is `!`, W is `@`, E is `#`, and so on). Some people put the numbers on a numpad-like grid, but I found this was easier for me to remember, and I quickly adjusted to using it.\n\nThat said, I personally prefer having a dedicated number row.\n\nI also configured a layer that had `[`, `]`, `(`, and `)` on JKL; so I could write markdown hyperlinks by just rolling my fingers on the home row. I think I eventually added `(` and `)` to U and I and `{` and `}` to M and `<` so I could easily reach those keys with my index and middle fingers, since they are the strongest fingers.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with starting with a split row staggered keyboard if it helps keep your wrists aligned and alleviates your symptoms. However, there are other options out there. For example, the Keebio Iris and Lily58 are popular split column staggered keyboards that have a dedicated number row.",

Tons of dead links and outdated information.\n\nI need a new keyboard, Money is no object if it lasts really long and as so good that it's actually worth it.:  \nI used a Corsair K95 RGB, Corsair K95 Platinum and Roccat Vulcan AINO, all with brown switches. I'm open to different switches, I'm not that sensitive to the differences, but it can't be to loud since I'm on calls a lot and 80%+ of time I just type on it.  \nI need a backlight. I use it for coding and typing and also gaming, so should be an allrounder. I use my volume and media controls a lot, so that would be a nice to have. Detachable USB cable would be nice, so I don't have to pull the cable from the cable management every time I want to use it somewhere else. Wireless option would useful, but not really necessary, it definitely should be wired first.  \nI like my Numpad, and I like extra features like USB hubs, programmable hotkeys and maybe an OLED I can feed with system info from Linux. I prefer something that will work out of the box but I'm fine with soldering if the result will be that much better. I like tinkering though, so after I've set it up, something like a programmable/open firmware would be nice.  \nI use 90% Linux, 5% Windows, 5% MacOS and it needs to work fine with all of them and preferably not have Windows keys.  \nWhile I like the idea of split and ergo keyboards, I fear the learning curve is too high and they are too limiting.  \nI'd also like something that looks cool, something that makes me want spend all my life in front of my computer without ever touching grass.  \nI like maintainability and cleanability, like my old roccat had the switches above the deck making it easy to clean, and it should last for a decade or more, preferably made locally (europe, cherry switches?). Of the ones I owned so far, the Roccat was my favorite, it looked delicious with great lighting, just the right features... but they were acquired and the new versions don't seem as good anymore.",

This causes the stem to hit the 0.25mm of flim not hanging into the travel path of the stem.\n\nCan I cut the films so they are just an O shape instead of the 8 shape?

            "body": "Hello Keyboard nerdz, I am thinking of getting the Keychron V6 Max. I currently have a G513 with romer tactile keys. For the last year I have been having keyboard problems like unregistered presses or double and sometimes triple presses. I have tried cleaning them, but being honest I don't have time to tinker with this failing system that is not even supported by logitech anymore. I am also in the middle of writing my thesis and I don't need the added excuse of my keyboard being frustrating stopping me from writing any more. \n\nI have enjoyed the 100% layout of the G513, and due to the analytical nature of my thesis I think I probably will end up with the 100%. I do like the look of the layout of the V5 but I actually think I would potentially miss the extra keys and the customized keys as well.\n\nThings I need:\n\n* 96% or 100% Keyboard layout\n* RGB backlight\n* PBT\n\nThings I want:\n\n* hot-swappable switches\n* decent acoustics\n* high stiffness\n* prefer shine through\n* prefer cherry type switches to make third party keycaps easier to find\n* angle adjustability, I have the wrist rest from the g513 so I have that covered\n* Would be nice if it offered USB passthrough like the G513 for mouse USB connection, but I haven't seen this anywhere (also I use a wired g502...)\n\nThings I don't care about:\n\n* I don't need wireless, It will be plugged in all the time, however wireless could come in handy for racing sim setup in the future.\n* volume knob is nice to have but unessisary\n\nKeyboard uses:\n\n* currently writing papers and my thesis\n* I play some games, (sim racing mainly) but have also dabbled in competitive shooters but will most likely be using the keyboard for games like cyberpunk, witcher, fallout and other non competitive RPGs.\n\nQuestions:\n\nThe V6/V5 comes with gateron jupiter red, brown and banana. Currently I have rommer g tactile which I understand is close to cherry browns. I like the tactile feeling, and banana is currently the only option which is in stock. What are your suggestions on switch type?\n\nI would love to know if you have alternatives to the Keychron V6 max. Almost everything I have seen from alternative manufacturers is that they don't offer 96 and 100% layouts.\n\nThanks for your time!",

The lighting is more of a sidenote for myself, so I don't pay too much attention to it. However, I've found that north-facing LEDs actually distribute the light much better. For shinethrough keycaps, north-facing lights also bring much better results. You *can* use side-printed shinethrough caps with south-facing LEDs. I have some of those, and they're pretty nice. But with non-shinethrough keycaps I don't notice the LEDs much, to be honest. They're certainly not too bright or anything, but you can also always adjust the brightness and the color, etc. Hope that helps!",

                    "body": "You've probably already come across this, but there are two main keyboard layouts: ANSI and ISO. ANSI is the standard in most of the world, whereas ISO is common in Europe. There are some sub-categories of ISO, such as UK-ISO, DE-ISO, Nordic-ISO, etc. \n\nThe good news is: Any ISO base board will work for your purposes, whether that's UK or Nordic. The key inputs will be the same, whichever ISO-layout you use, and if your boyfriend's computer is already set up for Danish inputs, any ISO-layout board will work. \n\nHowever, you might have a hard time finding Nordic-ISO keycaps. It's a small market, even smaller than DE-ISO or UK-ISO, so finding a complete set with Nordic-ISO keys will probably require some hunting. I know GMK usually offers Nordic-ISO sets, but they are one of the most expensive options out there. Lots of the cheaper, Chinese-manufactured keycap sets only come in ANSI with *maybe* an ISO Enter key and some UK-ISO extra keys, if that. \n\nKeychron is always a good first place to check for ISO-layouts, because they support such a wide variety of them. They'll definitely have *some* keyboard available in Nordic-ISO. The V Max Series is great for a barebones board under \u20ac100, while the Q Series is more upscale, with an aluminum case, etc. \n\nIf you go for a Keychron pre-built, you can obviously still change the switches (just make sure the board supports hotswap), and do any other mods you'd like. You might be stuck with the Keychron stock keycaps, but at least you'd have one complete set for Nordic-ISO, if the search for a third-party Nordic-ISO set is unsuccessful. \n\nI would also recommend searching for vendors that are located in one of the Nordic countries, as they'd obviously be more likely to stock Nordic keycaps: https://kbd.news/vendors/",

I was looking into the Mode Sonnet but I like my side keys, the arrow keys and those next to it, separated like on the GMMK Pro or Keychron Q1. However, I also looked at the Mode Loop. Unfortunately the Loop is limited stock and Mode said they have no intention of restocking (I have NO idea why they would do that). So my question is this: because its going to be awhile before I can buy either of these keyboards: what other high-end keyboards in the 75% and TKL category would fit the similar high-end rating as Mode's keyboards. Wireless and RGB are totally optional. Thanks!",

It is only top mount as well. But it does it well. It\u2019s a more \u201cpurist older enthusiast\u201d mounting style for high end boards.\n\nPros:\nA more timless and sharp angular design appearance.\n\nDoes not require any foam doesn\u2019t even come with it. ( good or bad thing, depending on your preference.)\n\nFeels premium like almost 6 pounds\n\nFree shipping\n\nCons:\nHotswap pcb does not have many layout options like 7u space bar.\n\nComes with the aluminum plate by default and cannot be swaped/choosen. You have to add on an extra one for at least $20 if you wanna try a different material.\n\nOnly top mount.\n\nWired only.\n\nThe Neo75 on the other hand uses a ball catch and pogo pin assembly. So it\u2019s insanely easy to take apart and modify. you basically just pull up and press down on the top case and it pops off and you remove the PCB and it connects with magnets. No finicky Jst cables.\n\nPROS:\n\nMore hotswap layout options\n\nWireless option\n\nChoose plate material\n\nCopper bottom (also a heft boy)\n\nSuper easy assembly\n\nCONS\n\nApparently people say the ball catch effects sound but this is very divisive. It still sounds great. Also it can wear down/ break easier over time.\n\nThe badge and curved edges look meh IMO. \n\n35-40 shipping within 4 weeks\n\nThat\u2019s about it really.\n\nCan\u2019t go wrong with either really, but it sounds like you will be free from screw hell. Hope this helps!",

My question is if someone knows of a list of such keyboard, or a database that I can query to find such keyboard list.\n\nExplanation to avoid the XY problem comments :). I probably won't be able to avoid them anyway.\n\nI do not need the num keypad (hence the TKL), and I use the function keys and the number keys (hence can't do 60%). I am also heavily dependent on home row mod (hence QMK) and I need 3 buttons in the spacebar place to use them for ENTER, SPACE, and SHIFT.\n\nI've used ergo keyboards before (lily58 and dactyl) and realized that for me ergo shape or split is not necessary more comfortable to me (but more cumbersome due to extra cable and due to getting used to laptop keyboard + the split keyboard). I realized what works for me is home row mod + avoiding using pinky for shift and enter.",

I understand that Kalam is essentially a clone of popular boards like the Unicorn and the Kohaku, but why are they so controversial. Singa has the ability to just make more boards. Yes it would bring down the \"value\" of them, but if people want them, why dont they just make more in more GBs or try and find someone to do a rolling in stock sale like QK does?",
