If you come from gaming, you will most likely use exclusivy left shit even for typing, as well es left thumb for space. This design makes the arrow keys, which most people do use, closer to the home row. \n\nIf you need right shift, there\u00b4s plenty allice models without that arrow key placement. Or you bind the up arrow to right shift when hold as well.",

I'd defo have to figure out a way to toggle function layers and turn them into arrow keys when I'm not using the right shift to type if I ever got one of these, or just accept that if I ever put cerakeys on an alice layout that the bottom row is going to be all black/white.",
