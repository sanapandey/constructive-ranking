Just need to right click the image and change the layout, whether it pushes text aside (which is default), goes in front of the text, back from the text etc. etc.\n\nThere should be an option to have the image be placed in freeform, then just simply drag to where you want it.\n\nEdit: [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/wrap-text-and-move-pictures-in-word-becff26a-d1b9-4b9d-80f8-7e214557ca9f](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/wrap-text-and-move-pictures-in-word-becff26a-d1b9-4b9d-80f8-7e214557ca9f) here's a tutorial.

For example if I have \"As you can see at the diagram below\" in my text I want that diagram to be below that line. Even if I changed shitload of text on previous pages. So having images be inside the text by default is the best option for that kind of use.",

Rather than asking the Internet every time you don't know how to do something, it might be worth taking a course on Microsoft Word so that you get a good tour of all of its capabilities. There are courses here, for example:\n\n[https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=microsoft%20word](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=microsoft%20word)\n\nAnother idea is to find a book. There are hundreds of books on Word / Office, and your public library probably has a bunch. Even a book that's 10 years old is probably okay; anything since the ribbon was introduced in 2007.\n\nThe full suite of Adobe tools is $90/month if you pay monthly (less if you pay a year upfront). Compared to how much it costs to get started in so many fields, that's pretty darn cheap. The sooner you start using proper tools the better. Imagine if someone wanted to be a professional photographer but they tried to wait until they had made enough money before buying a \"real\" camera - that would make no sense, right?",

What I look for is talent, skills, and knowledge.\n\nYou need the right tools (like Adobe creative suite), you need to know how to use them, and you need to be skilled at using them effectively. I occasionally open up Photoshop and I'm not afraid to play around with it, but it might take me an hour to do what my graphic designer can do in 5 minutes. I'm not paying them to fiddle with it for an hour like I can do myself, I want them to be fast and efficient.\n\nYou need knowledge of graphic design theory and principles. Are you comfortable with terms like kerning and ligatures? Do you know color theory and the differences between print and display?\n\nFinally, you need to have artistic talent. That doesn't mean you can draw a realistic cat, it means that you can apply all of the skills and knowledge but also make something that other people find aesthetically pleasing.",
