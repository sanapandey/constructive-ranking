If we could stay in the building, it was business as usual, even with the noise. Activities and programs just went on and we did our best to keep everyone calm. Honestly alot of residents didn't react to the noise and those who did were relatively easy to redirect (even if it meant someone was with them 1:1 for the entirety of the drill reassuring them). Our staff was awesome at keeping residents out of their rooms and involved in activities during the day, so everyone was usually in the common areas anyway.\n\nIf we had to move outside, activities had a little go bag with some game cards and sing a long books that we'd do in the garden! Our care staff ratios were pretty great (1 CNA to 5-6 residents) so they were still able to keep everyone safe and contained. We regularly had activities outside so it felt normal to the residents and staff.",

Like they will actually go to a contained area outside with real fire extinguishers and everyone learns how to use them. Depending on the building and what is going on they don't just leave immediately, some areas will try to contain or reduce the fire with the extinguishers so it doesn't spread. \n\nEvacuate - After steps R, A, C are done / attempted, then you evacuate. \n\nHospitals are designed so that there are physical firewalls and fire doors and exits and ventilation systems. So if there is active surgery going on they're not going to just leave all of a sudden.

Vents are isolated from the rest of the wards, both for smoke and to prevent disease spread. Surgical teams stay in place to end the surgery as fast as possible. No aiding other departments, their task is to get the patient closed up and stable. In short, the OR is intended to stay afloat while other departments may suffer more.\n\nThere's also an insane amount of planning around a fire in the OR itself, as oxygen and electric appliances in close proximity are bad news. Protocols around putting out fires, whose job that is, and who brings the backup online to keep the surgery moving forward. \n\nSemi-related: Got to put out a gas fire in a cut off 55 gallon drum for fire extinguisher training.

If that was not an option, vertical evac happened: moving up and down floors, typically down. \n\nEven non patient handling personnel like myself could be pulled to help evac, usually to help wheel whatever is needed. If a patient was under surgery, the surgery team would stick with them. If the patient was recovering in PACU, PACU nurses, techs, and nearby support staff would evac them.\n\nHonestly, hospitals build in a lot of redundancies for safety reasons.

If we could not have finished before we absolutely had no choice, we would have set up a mobile o2 and anesthesia unit and treated for exposure to an unsterile environment.
