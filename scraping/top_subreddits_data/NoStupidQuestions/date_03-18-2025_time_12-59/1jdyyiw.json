            "body": "The price for any stock includes a lot of theoretical value based on how the company is expected to perform in the future.  Tesla price is absolutely insane if they are viewed primarily as a car company, but the people that have been investing in Tesla think of it as a tech company on the leading edge of multiple potential groundbreaking technologies (autonomous vehicles, batteries, solar panels, robots, artificial intelligence).  They think that because Tesla was ahead of the curve on electric vehicles, they will also be ahead of the curve in all these new markets, and all of them will be very profitable, and that is used to justify the expense of the stock.  Of course other people view Tesla as a car company with struggling sales and dropping margins, with major decimation of its brand, an absentee CEO who is also has the highest salary in corporate history, and who\u2019s solutions to all of these problems is spending massive amounts of money on moonshots that are unlike if to be profitable any time soon.  Those two types of people have vastly different opinions on the proper valuation of the company.",

You don't invest into a company because it performed well but because you believe it will perform well in the future. At least if you plan to make a profit off of your investment",

With Tesla, people invest based on past successes and the expectation of future successes. I agree with other posts saying that current evaluation is flawed and nowhere near the current value, but that doesn't make it imaginary value, just speculative like anything else, we won't truly know until the future becomes present. It would be akin to someone marrying a person who they love a lot but everyone else can only see red flags! Doesn't make the idea of marriage imaginary or dumb, just that one marriage very risky.  \n  \n \\> Hopefully, if you adopt a dog, you like dogs and are able and willing to care for a dog properly, and will enjoy what a dog brings to your life.\n\nFor sure, but many people buy dogs and end up realizing that it's more work than expected. Or they buy a dog and it ends up having diseases that make it more expensive to care for. Or it has a nasty personality the person heavily dislike. Or they end up marrying someone who doesn't want to care for a dog, and things get complicated. This would be akin to buying Tesla early because it did have potential, and then watching Musk dropping a big fat dump in everything, so you need to decide if you'll sell your stocks.\n\nAgain, to be clear, I'm not actually comparing having a dog with stocks, dogs are living creatures and we have different emotions and responsibilities towards them, it's different. But we do make decisions based on future expectations, and that happens across our lives.",

You can purchase new excavators that will increase your extraction rate.  You can look at the trends in gold pricing.  You can do all of this and estimate the future value of the company.  If you sold that company you wouldn't sell it based on how much gold you excavated last quarter, you'd sell it based on predictions of future value.  Any of those elements to the prediction could be wrong, but that doesn't mean that price tag is imaginary.\n\nNow there are investors that are going purely on gut, or based off of highly questionable assumptions, so there is some imaginary value there, it's just not what most investments are based on.",

            "body": "Tesla's value at present cannot be justified if you look at any comparable companies like Ford, Chevy, Toyota, VW group, etc. The stock price would need to drop 70% to be in line with other companies.\n\nSo what are investors looking at?\n\n1. Full self drive. If you can crack FSD using just camera tech like Tesla is trying to do it opens up massive opportunities and not just in car sales. You could potentially retrofit every existing car in America with Tesla tech FSD. You could license it to all you competition... And this could be huge revenue in form of up front costs + ongoing monthly subscription revenue, which has massive margins.\n\n2. Robotaxi fleets. What if you could actually not own a car, but just ring one up on demand as needed? How much do you pay for that monthly subscription or on demand service? Look at total cost of ownership on a car, and for anyone who lives in a city it becomes a no brainer. No more insurance, refueling costs, maintenance, finance costs, etc. Combine that with an option for a weekly vacation sole use so you can leave your shit in the car and it becomes really easy to see it bringing in massive revenues without any need for annoying dealerships.\n\n3. Optimus robot. If somehow you can make a humanoid robot with good dexterity and combine with LLM tools so you can have a floor supervisor give orders to 100 robots and they set to work that is also hugely valuable. Even at a McDonald's if it could cook and bag and hand out food. If it cost $50k and had a life of 3 years that is only $17k/year, which is cheaper than an employee and you don't have to give it time off, it never calls in sick, it can't sue if it burns itself with coffee or oil or if the manager tries to fuck it, and it doesn't quit after 6 months so no retraining the next one (in fact, all training is transferred to replacement when original one is kaput).\n\nNow, none of those have come in yet, and part of the reason for the drop is that many investors believed that only Elon could possibly deliver on them. As he is no longer focused on Tesla, but just on Maga, the share price is reflecting that. I would guess if he keeps alienating buyers and ignoring his business it will fall much, much farther.\n\nEdit: I want to add that I think Tesla is overvalued and a lot of this will not materialize, but this is what people are banking on.",

Your train gets to the station at 4am, you check Uber and there is nothing because drivers are all asleep. Robotaxi is always on call \n5.

He's convinced investors that it should be valued more as a tech company than a car company.  Tech is usually valued higher for stock price, since a new tech breakthrough (like iPhone, or a new killer app) can often drive profits exponentially.  Car companies, even very successful ones, usually have thinner profit margins and more gradual growth, so they are generally valued lower.\n\nSo that's why we see Musk hyping up future stuff like Robotaxi, AI, and Optimus humanoid robots so much --  it's key to Tesla continually being seen as a tech company and not a car company.  \n\nTo be fair, it helps that Musk did the seemingly impossible: he made mass market electric cars a reality, and grew Tesla pretty quickly.  He definitely deserves credit for that.  The success of SpaceX also makes it look like Musk has the golden touch.\n\nMoving forward though, the picture is less rosy.  Other car manufacturers have largely caught up in EVs.  Key developments like unsupervised self-driving keep getting pushed back, and other manufacturers are catching up in that area too.  Optimus may or may not ever materialize as a market, it's too soon to say.  And his outspoken and controversial politics are alienating a lot of people.  So yeah, we're seeing a big drop in stock price, and my guess is it will keep heading downward.",
