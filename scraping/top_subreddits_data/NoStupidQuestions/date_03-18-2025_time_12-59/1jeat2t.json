Our users routinely report questions that they feel violate this rule to us. Want to avoid your question being seen as a bad faith question? Common mistakes include (but are not limited to): \r\n\r\n* Rants: Could your question be answered with *'That's awful'* or *'What an asshole'*? Then it's probably a rant rather than a genuine question. Looking for a place to vent on Reddit? Try /r/TrueOffMyChest or /r/Rant instead.\r\n\r\n* Loaded questions: Could your question be answered with *'You're right'*? Answering the question yourself, explaining your reasoning for your opinion, or making sweeping assumptions about the question itself all signals that you may not be keeping an open mind. Want to know why people have a different opinion than you? Try /r/ExplainBothSides instead!\r\n\r\n* Arguments: Arguing or [sealioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lioning) with people giving you answers tells everyone that you have an answer in mind already. Want a good debate? Try /r/ChangeMyView instead!\r\n\r\n* Pot Stirring: Did you bring up unnecessary topics in your question? Especially when a topic has to do with already controversial issues like politics, race, gender or sex, this can be seen as trying to score points against the Other Side - and that makes people defensive, which leads to arguments. Questions like *\"If _____ is allowed, why isn't _____?\"* don't need to have that comparison - just ask *'why isn't ____ allowed?'*.\r\n\r\n* Complaining about moderation: If you disagree with how the sub is run or a decision the mods have made, that's fine! But please share your thoughts with us in modmail rather than as a public post. \r\n\r\nDisagree with the mods? If you believe you asked your question in good faith, try rewording it or message the mods to see if there's a way you could ask more neutrally. Thanks for your understanding!\n\n---\r\n\r\n*This action was performed by a bot at the explicit direction of a human.

They\u2019re a safe bet for families at the cinema and the spate of Disney Renaissance remakes also brought in millennials with a disposable income and no kids. They carry less risk than original films, much like the animated films which used familiar fairytales as their scaffold and selling point.\n\nhttps://www.decodingeverything.com/p/brief-history-of-live-action-remakes-dragons-lion-king-beauty-and-the-beast",

They have the I.P. they have the loyal following for each of the fairy tales/ stories so they are cashing in on the idea that was birthed with Jungle Book and is gonna finish a long time from now.   Will smith as the Genie sucked, all of a sudden Snow White isnt white when she was alabaster white in the cartoon fine, its how Disney rolls this day, but Lion King was fun, Beauty and the Beast was great.  Its hit or miss, just like Marvel. But for a studio its way easier to gain traction on a much loved I.P. then create something original and plunk a ton of money down on a question mark.",
