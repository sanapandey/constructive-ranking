We get *tons* of questions about the president, the supreme court, and other topics related to American politics - but often the same ones over and over again. Our users often get tired of seeing them, so we've created a megathread for questions! Here, users interested in politics can post questions and read answers, while people who want a respite from politics can browse the rest of the sub. **Feel free to post your questions about politics in this thread!** \n\nAll top-level comments should be questions asked in good faith -   other comments and loaded questions will get removed. All the usual   rules of the sub remain in force here, so **be nice to each other** \\- you can disagree with someone's opinion, but don't make it personal.",

President Trump has also repeatedly said that Canada as a whole should become part of the US, and that Canadians should welcome this. He has also claimed that the Canadian government is illegitimate and cannot protect Canadians, and that Canadian tariffs are a threat to innocent Americans (leaving aside the simple fact that Trump is the one who started this trade war). A lot of this is similar to rhetoric that other countries have used before launching invasions over \"disputed\" territory. \n\nIt seems unthinkable, and yet, President Trump is clearly laying all this rhetorical groundwork for *something*, and it sure doesn't seem friendly.",

I can understand the fluidity and spectrum nature of sexuality who you find attractive, want to be with etc.. I have very close family member who are part of the community and am in full support.

To me, by the same logic, I am 5\u201911\u201d and have a moderate stature, not extremely short but certainly not tall, something I can\u2019t change. I could never be an NFL lineman because of my natural genetics and if I took meds to change some of that, I would be \u201cjuicing\u201d, which is not allowed. Why doesn\u2019t the trans issue fall in to this category?

Imo trans women should not really affect any of these things.\n\n\nI think an argument could be made for safety but rather than ban people, I think the solution there is to change the rules - we do this all the time for men's sports that can cause injury like football.\n\n\nHonestly it's a fundamentally difficult issue because the trans women experience in America is one where yhey excluded and are left to die in a ditch after being forced into homelessness and likely prostitution.\u00a0\n\n\nSo people that understand that experience really struggle to empathize with cis women being forced to deal losing occasionally when it's not like every trans woman is dominant athlete anyways",

That said, I am out of my depth talking about title 9 so I could definitely be getting that wrong, but you said I have logical answers so I'll try not to let you down lol\n\nSo in your first example, I think the only specific sacrifice is that a minority of athletes will lose out on scholarships. I'll try to touch on what else I think you meant by opportunities at the end though.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not against title 9 explicitly being for people AFAB. In that case, I think we gotta figure out what to do with trans men but that gets into steroids in mens sports which I feel is probably due for some change too.\n\nThat said, I think the bigger issue is how many trans women are taking scholarships from cis women - aka are we banning all the trans women from sports because 20 cis women couldn't get a scholarship. Can't we just provide 20 exceptions instead of banning 100s of kids from sports...\n\nWhich gets into the second part the first example which is the hurt feelings. Personally, I can say that sports was the my main source of socialization in middle and high school. I actually did not like the sport itself, but having teammates - friends - was something I valued to the point that I actually quit and rejoined because I missed that social aspect.\n\nI think maintaining that is a lot more important than giving a couple athletes good enough to get scholarships a discount to go to college. I am sure that there are instances where the money makes a big difference, but its crazy to blame kids not having enough money to go to college on trans people wanting to play sports imo... at that point we are literally pinning the blame of a big societal problem on a minority group's desire to pursue happiness.\n\nAs far as the cancer example, I'm not sure this is a counter, but I think of James Conner who had leukemia in college, went through chemo, graduated, was drafted into the NFL and is now a multi-millionaire pro football player living in Arizona. What provisions did we need to make for him?\n\nMy point isn't that chemo can't end an athlete's career, but if you were actually good enough to make real money, your talent won't stop you regardless of whether you competed against a trans person or if you had cancer or whatever. I think this holds for other opportunities you mentioned in your first example (ADHD will admit Catelyn Jenner won 'woman of the year' but no one but the most inane thought that was a good idea). At least that's my take, but I'll leave the thread at that.\n\nIf you have other questions, I think finding trans right groups/phone numbers/web pages/etc will give you the answers and missing pieces you need to understand the position because I'm embarrassed by how long the wall is.

He has slashed staff at departments that were investigating Tesla, and other departments have (or might have) contracts with SpaceX. \n* The constitution says it is up to Congress to authorise spending. The legal way for a president to slash federal government expenditure is to pressure congress to pass bills that slash it. Trump, Musk and DOGE bypass Congress.\n* Many of the programs that have been slashed are hugely beneficial to people around the world and in the USA. For example, \n   * USAID used to perform humanitarian activities all over the developing world. Most of those programmes have been cut, putting lives at risk from preventable diseases.\n   * USAID was also a tool for the US to promote its own interests around the world. Slashing it has weakened the United States' position in the world. \n   * There have been huge cuts to medical and other research funding. The US, in the past, was an incredibly important player in medical research. That may no longer be the case. \n* Some people are upset because they (or their friends) are now in danger of losing their jobs or benefits. Or, that large job-losses will slow down the economy, hurting everyone. \n\nThere are probably other reasons. But TL;DR: it's illegal, bad for people and the economy, and ripe for corruption.",

They LIKE that he's dumb, and uneducated, and has no clue about most things. Same as they LIKE that he's openly misogynistic, racist, and just blusters and says nothing and acts like ppl are scared of him.

He played right into it, pretending to be from Texas, basically. People actually somehow believed he was a \"regular\" guy, not a moneyed, prep/Ivy elite dope grew up in a political family.\n\nThe same way many of Trump's supporters will say, straight-faced, that he's one of them, self-made, down-to-earth, as if he didn't inherit a $400m business and grew up in Manhattan as the moneyed elite and live in a fucking gold penthouse.\n\n>Across three surveys of eligible voters\u00a0from 2016 to 2018, we found that as many as half of all Americans do not know that he was born into a very wealthy family.\u00a0\n\n[https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/01/17/many-voters-think-trumps-a-self-made-man-what-happens-when-you-tell-them-otherwise-224019/](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/01/17/many-voters-think-trumps-a-self-made-man-what-happens-when-you-tell-them-otherwise-224019/)\n\nWhen Obama was running, a lot of the voiced criticism was that he was \"elite\" -- went to Columbia, was a professor, when he actually WAS self-made, grew up normal, etc.\n\nJon Stewart had a thing then, ranting on the Daily Show, asking when 'elite' and educated became a bad thing in a president -- \"Not only do I want an elite president, I want someone who\u2019s embarrassingly superior to me, somebody who speaks 16 languages and sleeps two hours a night hanging upside down in a chamber they themselves designed.\u201d",

                    "body": "Basically, the President has a limited domain in which he can act unilaterally without confirmation from Congress.\n\nMost presidents find this rather restrictive, because most of the productive, valuable things a president can do have already been done, so they need to work with Congress to accomplish further productive, valuable things.\n\nHowever, Trump wants to seem like a big, powerful leader, so he does things that are within the President's power even when they're unproductive or damaging - or even especially when they're unproductive or damaging. The restrictions around the presidency aren't really built to withstand a president who acts that way. Indeed, you could say there's never been a president that's acted that way before.\n\nTariffs are a good example. Trump doesn't care about tariffs intrinsically, but it's something the president has a lot of leeway on, so he does tariffs almost randomly. Every week he has a different tariff plan. The media dutifuly reports on how much the president is getting done (setting things on fire). But crucially, if the president didn't have power over tariffs but did have power over, say, sales taxes, then you could be sure that it would be sales taxes that would go wild, and he would never even mention tariffs. Trump is only looking for ways to make himself feel powerful, he's not *first* deciding what would be constructive and *then* trying to operate within the confines of the presidency to accomplish that.\n\nThe power over tariffs and many other presidential powers are granted by Congress, so they could stop him from doing this if they were willing to rein in the president. Obviously they would never vote on a different absurd tariff on our closest trading partner every week purely for the president's PR. But they are also too spineless to say \"no\", so we get this chaos.\n\nIn other areas, the stuff Trump is doing is actually ambiguous or flat out illegal, but he's doing it in a way that the courts can't keep up. For instance, governmental departments are funded by Congress, and Congress defines their mission. It's potentially illegal for the president to simply refuse to do that, and fire everyone without the advice and consent of Congress. Which is why Trump's administration isn't just firing people, but it's also burning and shredding classified documents. You can re-hire people by court order, but you can't un-burn documents on in-progress medical studies. He wants to cause as much damage as possible, and make it as hard to reverse as possible.",

The Republican Party (by and large) has agreed to back Trump and questioning him or his agenda is practically forbidden. So one of the big checks on the Executive Branch is basically refusing to perform any checks on the Executive. \n\nAdditionally, Trump is using \"backdoor\" ways to let Musk and DOGE start tearing through agencies and the government in an attempt to \"save money\". And again, Congress doesn't seem inclined to rein Musk in or stand up to Trump. \n\nThis Administration, Trump also has a much stronger team behind him than his first term. His first term he has no connections or significant backers, so his Administration was largely made up of either ineffective donors/friends or GOP appointees who kept many of Trumps ideas in check. This time, he came in with almost 100% support of the party and conservative organizations (like the Heritage Foundation). So he has much more capable people to enact his agenda this go around than the first time.\n\nWe are also just seeing how slow and restricted the courts are. It takes days/weeks for courts to issue preliminary injunctions or restraining orders, and failure there means nothing will change while cases play out. So the courts have minimal short term ability to check power.",

Consider a simple example with one big party that tends to get 40% of the vote, then several smaller parties that tend to get 30%, 20%, and 10%. The party that gets 40% will win almost every single election, even though a majority of voters preferred other options.\n\nIt's not like a proportional representation system, or a parliamentary system where the small parties can form a coalition. In our system, the smaller parties end up locked out of government almost completely. \n\nAs a result, groups tend to consolidate into bigger and bigger parties, which tends to stabilize once there are two political parties that each get about 50% of the vote. That's what we have today. \n\nSome people do want to change this, but changing electoral laws is not an easy task and not everyone agrees that a change is needed, or on what the right change would be.",

You'd think that Trump is projecting an air of strength to the world, that the US \"isn't going to take this crap any longer\". If you live in reality, you'd know that these are all imagined grievances, and that the US is not being taken advantage of - if anything the US is fully benefitting from the advantage of its position as the orchestrator of a global hegemony. But, this could change very soon thanks to Trump's specific, indisputable actions. \n\nYou need look no further than his grievances about our trade deficit with Canada - if you have done even a single class in economics, then you'd know that trade deficits are a completely normal thing for consumer economies like the US - we import far more than we export and that is in no way 'subsidizing' Canada. We benefit from the goods they can manufacture that we buy, they benefit from the goods we manufacture that they buy, we just have a much larger population, and much less need for the things they produce. That's all. So, Trump using this as an excuse to impose tariffs is a blatant lie/exaggeration/misunderstanding of basic macroeconomics. Absolutely nobody should be 'happy' about being lied to like that, but because many are unaware of it, they're fine with his tariffs.\n\nThe truth of the matter is, it depends on what your perception of reality is. The truth doesn't lie somewhere in the middle between reality and a fantasy world. The truth is the truth, but since we cannot all physically follow Trump around making sure he's doing the right thing that pleases us, the question for each of us individually is ultimately, who/what do you choose to believe? \n\nWhile believing lies can make you feel good in the short term, if your beliefs don't align with reality, and you keep doubling down on those beliefs in light of evidence to the contrary, then you're in for a shocking dose of reality when it catches up with you at some point in the future.",

The US' electoral system inherently incentivises a two-party system, so multi-party situations rarely last outside of a brief window of crisis for one of the establishment parties, after which a dominant party reasserts itself while the others wither away.\n\nThe Federalists, for example, were simply trounced by the Democratic-Republicans and then had their reputation tarnished by the War of 1812. Aspiring politicians with Federalist ideals eventually found it easier to just form their own faction within the bloated Democratic-Republicans than oppose them from the outside, so the Federalist Party went extinct even if its political ideas did not.\n\nThis consequently doomed the Democratic-Republicans to eventually split between the Jacksonian Democrats and the Adams-Clay National Republicans (later the Whigs), because it no longer had any unifying principles. As the issue of slavery came to the forefront of politics, the Southern Democrats mostly stabilised around pro-slavery interests while the Whigs failed to find a position that satisfied its varied membership, causing the anti-slavery faction to join the nascent Republican Party while the rest of the Whigs dispersed.\n\nThe Republican and Democratic parties have remained the dominant parties since then, but obviously much has still changed since 1860 even if the labels haven't. Just as the party names may change but the underlying political blocs remain the same, so too can the names remain the same even as their political positions realign. As a result, I wouldn't expect the current parties to collapse any time soon, but rather that internal factions vying for control to become more obvious and organised.",

Can there be tariffs on services, or do they only affect physical goods?\n\n5. How often are importers audited or inspected to ensure they comply with tariff laws?\n\n6. I imagine there is some kind of job equivalent to a tax accountant, but for tariffs \u2014 someone who gets paid by importers to ensure they know how much money to pay the government. What do you call this job?\n\n7. When tariff rates change, do they always change at a certain time of day (such as midnight), and if so, what time zone? What happens if a shipment of goods is crossing the border at the moment the rate change occurs?\n\n8. How effective is enforcement on tariffs? What percentage of owed tariffs does the government actually manage to collect?",

Bills of lading for things arriving by ship are actually public info. The government already knows who brought what in, so they'll know to be expecting payment and will not release items from customs until it's paid.\n\n8. Probably most to all of them. It's collected by customs and customs works on-site, and again bills of lading are already public info for vessels so not only does the government know whats in them but so can the everyman, and they surely have their finger in the pie so to speak for air shipments and ground shipments as well, checking documentation and whatnot.

                    "body": "The idea behind the proposal is to change the government's main revenue source from income tax to tariffs (and/or sales tax).\n\nFor example, let's say person A makes $4,000 per month, and say $800 goes to federal income tax, leaving person A $3,200 to spend on their personal needs.\n\nUnder the proposal of tariffs being the primary source of revenue, person A now makes $4,000 per month.  However, tariffs are added onto the goods they purchase, causing the price of those goods to rise from $3,200 per month $4,000 per month.  (Now $4,000 per month is quite generous, because Trump is floating number like 25% tariffs, 50% tariffs, 200% tariffs, and those figures would blow the price of goods well past $4,000 per month, but that's besides the point.)\n\nIn other words, the same $800 goes to the federal government, but under income tax you pay the government directly, whereas under tariffs the $800 is paid by the importer/retailer.  A snake oil salesman might be able to convince people that they're making way more money so they're better off, but the cost of everything rises with the tariffs, so they're really the same (or worse) than they were before.\n\nHowever, because tariffs are only charged on imports, it incentivizes Americans to purchase made in America goods.  This strengthens the manufacturing sector for domestic sales, but weakens it for export/global sales.\n\nLet's pretend a certain company is selling stoves.  The American company can sell them at $110, but a foreigner can rely on cheap foreign labour and make the stove for $100.  Therefore, most people go with the $100 stove.  Now Trump shows up and slaps a 25% tariff on foreign stoves.  The added tax raises the price of the foreign stove to $125, and most Americans now choose the American stove.  However, the American company sees the new price of stoves, and decides to raise their price to $120.  $120 vs $125, they still own the American market.  But outside of America, it's now $100 vs $120, so the American stove is even less attractive.\n\nTherefore, the manufacturing sector is strengthened domestically, but weakened globally; and American consumers are still stuck paying more for their goods.\n\nNow in terms of the impact this would have on the average American:  \n\nIncome tax is one of the only progressive taxes that exists in America.  It is a tax where the wealthy pay tax at a higher percentage rate than the poor.\n\nBy contrast, a tax on common goods, whether it's sales tax or tariffs, is a regressive tax.  The poor actually pay a higher percentage rate than the rich.  This is because the poor are required to spend 100% of their income in order to stay alive, whereas the wealthy only spend a small percentage of their income.  As such, a 10% sales tax ends up being a full 10% tax on the poor, but on the rich it's more like a 1% tax because the rest goes into more stocks.\n\nSo really this is about changing the tax system from a system where the rich pay a heavier load, to a system where the poor pay a heavier load.",

Everything. Even houses.  \n\nThey word it so the tax is 23% of the final total..  If your item costs $77 before tax, then you add $23 of tax, that's a total of $100. 23% of that $100 is the tax.  But 23/77 = 0.2987 ~ 30%.  \n\nThe bill also says that certain people can claim a monthly rebate check on sales taxes if they are below a poverty level. But they have to register and keep up with their paperwork to remain eligible - anyone in jail, prison, mental hospitals is disqualified; anyone who isn't a lawful permanent resident is disqualified; anyone who doesn't have a valid Social Security number is disqualified. \n\nState tax agencies are charged with collecting the tax and forwarding it to the Federal government.

The reference to \"outdated war on drugs solutions\" is simply noting that several decades of similar tactics have barely made a dent in the illegal drug trade.

Too many people are competing with each other for the same apartments.\n\nTariffs make prices go up due to taxes, yes, but they only effect those specific goods.

The idea of a person changing their associated gender, regardless of the sex they were assigned at birth, has always been around. But it's never been taken nearly as seriously as in recent decades, nor has it had this high of cultural acceptance. So a lot of social conservatives consider the theory of gender identity being flexible as radical, new, and not supported by science (regardless of whether that last one's true or not).\n\n>I hear the word freedom thrown around a lot but then why constantly try to restrict these people\u2019s freedom to be themselves or whoever they want to be when they\u2019re not hurting anyone?\n\nThis is just a guess, but I think there may be a few overlaps here, with the backlash that same-sex marriage experienced in the late 2000's. Back then, opponents of same-sex marriage branded themselves as defenders of the institution of marriage, and that the idea of legalizing it would involve the government telling churches (that facilitate marriages) what to do. But as more states legalized it, and people realized that their marriages and churches remained the same, I think people realized how little validity these arguments had.\n\nSimilarly, I think social conservatives have a fear that legal requirements and social obligations would require people to act against their personal beliefs, when it comes to interacting with (or providing services to) trans people. Like it shouldn't matter to anyone else what letter a trans person has on their passport for \"Sex\", But people have outstanding questions about trans inclusion in gender-segregated sports teams, or how a parent can make decisions on how to help their teenager explore their gender identity without jumping the gun. And the answers to that aren't clear or universally understood yet. It's possible that fear and hate will reside once clearer answers are available to the public on how people can reconcile their disagreement with their ability to conduct themselves in social/professional interactions. But yes, it sucks that trans people are on the receiving end of bullying and discrimination in the meantime.\n\nIt's true that social conservatives support individual liberties as a traditional American value that's worth upholding, but they also tend to advocate for government regulations on those liberties **for the sake of** upholding values. Whether that's nuance, or hypocrisy, is up to personal interpretation. But they're less likely to stand by the \"let trans people do what they want, they're not hurting anyone\" stance than libertarians, who uphold individual liberties above all else.",

We still accept that sexual orientation can vary based on people's accounts of their preferences and their observed choices.\n\nWhile it's believed that the relative number of homosexuals has remained constant while social attitudes have changed, the recent increase in the number of people who identity as transsexual is difficult to conclusively analyze, and many people claiming to present scientific evidence regarding any hypothesis seem to be politically motivated, both 'for' and 'against'.\n\nThe biggest problem with the \"no one's being harmed, let trans people do as they please\" argument is that many demand the participation of others in their defined identities.  People who disapprove of or disagree with homosexuality can just politely ignore gays, and vice versa.\n\n(edit to correct word)",

At least, that's the case for gay men - whether it's for the sake of minimizing variables, or due to underlying sexism, a lot more focus has been put on studying these trends in men than women.\n\nGranted, I imagine there's a lot of biological indicators that predispose people towards *many* different overall inclinations, but the focus on sexuality has certainly warranted a lot of research into this particular area.\n\n>...and many people claiming to present scientific evidence regarding any hypothesis seem to be politically motivated, both 'for' and 'against'.\n\nTrue, and the rise in public social opposition towards established institutions - including national medical organizations - isn't helping there.\n\n>The biggest problem with the \"no one's being harmed, let trans people do as they please\" argument is that many demand the participation of others in their defined identities. People who disapprove of or disagree with homosexuality can just politely ignore gays, and vice versa.\n\nI'm confused - why can gay people be \"politely ignored\", but not trans people? Or are you saying that one's married status is not as clearly obvious from first impressions or initial conversations, than one's gender identity?",

We are currently unable to look at the brain of a cadaver and identify whether they were homosexual or not.\n\n>I'm confused - why can gay people be \"politely ignored\", but not trans people?\n\nSexuality isn't a fundamental part of basic social interaction any more than political affiliation is.  But even the most rudimentary interactions tend to involve gender markers.  We have conventions for what names are for men and women, for example, and the names that are gender-neutral are relatively uncommon.  See the classic song \"A Boy Named Sue\" and the SNL skit \"It's Pat!\" for examples.",

Sure, there can be other emotions that can explain this hesitation other than \"hate\" or \"fear\" (and Democrats still have a ways to go, themselves), but it results in prejudice and discrimination, regardless of motive.\n\nAnd this is more of a side note, but:\n\n>39% of those who don\u2019t know someone who is transgender say it\u2019s extremely or very important to refer to a person who goes through a gender transition and changes their name by their new name.\n\nCompared to 57% who *do* know a transgender person agreeing with this, I feel like this polling study shows how much non-political, non-logistical factors can play a role in peoples' acceptance of trans people.",

Coming close to making an enemy of Europe as a whole and looking weak and untrustworthy as an ally?

Trump tends to view all negotiations as distributive in nature, meaning there is a limited supply of scarce value and he wins by grabbing as much of that value as he can. This sometimes works well in the business world, especially in situations where he deals with each party once and he doesn't much care if they like him or not. In his view, angering the other side of a negotiation is no problem, as long as he gets what he wants. If he angers a bunch of other parties, he sees that as a sign that he's getting what he wants (and they are not).\n\nBasically, if Trump angers our allies, he doesn't necessarily think that is a problem. If anything, he views it almost more as an opportunity.",

It's a free space for people to express themselves without consideration for any specific audience.\n\n* It's a public forum where everything that everyone posts, ever, can be reacted to and commented on.

People post without a care in the world about who reads it, someone who reads it is goaded into forming an emotional judgment and sharing their opposition, and the original poster feels attacked by this outsider who's entered their personal space and given their unsolicited opinion.

                    "body": "In addition to what others are saying - it's complicated. \n\nNo, the US cannot be self-sufficient with petroleum under current conditions. \n\nWe have lots of drilling operations, and we drill for lots of oil. We have shale oil, we have underground and underwater drilling. We bring up lots of raw oil every year.  \n\nBUT...  raw petroleum by itself isn't very useful. It needs to be refined.  The US used to have several hundred refineries. We have lost them through age, failure, consolidation, and lack of use.  We still have a few hundred- and we still have just as much capacity as we did in the mid-1980s.   That's a good thing.  We keep them running, we make efficiency improvements, we run 24/7/356 and never shut them down.  \n\nBUT...  we didn't have a history of drilling and sourcing our own oil here. We were used to importing raw petroleum from outside.  We imported from our neighbors in Canada and Venezuela, as well as OPEC, Mexico and others.  Most of the petroleum we imported to refine here was higher in sulfur content - sometimes called 'heavy' and 'sour' crude.  Our refineries are designed to efficiently handle heavy/sour crude. \n\nThe raw petroleum we drill is \"light sweet crude\".  \"Light Sweet Texas Crude\" is often named in media and even stories that discuss commodities. This is much lower in sulfur and other compounds. This crude oil isn't efficiently processed in our refineries. \n\nLike u/notextinctyet pointed out, \n>Trade makes it so that you get the most appropriate things instead of the things you just happen to have lying around.\n\nWe have found out that it is a lot more economical to sell our light sweet crude to other nations.  They have refineries for that kind of raw product. Then they sell final products like diesel, gasoline, plastics, and other things.  We import some of that if we need them for our markets.  \n\nWe also know it's economical to import heavy/sour crude. We keep our refineries working at peak efficiency. We have finished products ready right here - close to where they are needed and can be sold. We don't need to worry about tariffs, logistics, shipping because we can sell much of those final products right here in the US.  Our refineries do also export many products. \n\nSo, the situation is complicated. We have lots of crude oil, lots of refineries, lots of markets. We just don't have ways to put all of those pieces together efficiently.  If there was a huge push for that, I suppose we could invest a ton of money and time into a \"petroleum infrastructure\" - but we all know that cheap, easy-to-find & access petroleum supplies won't last long, and such a system will only serve to cut us off from global trade more. \n\n- - - - - \n\nThese complications are why there is a specific 10% exception for Canadian energy.  After all the rhetoric spent blaming the Biden administration for gas prices, Trump is not going to shoot himself in the foot by placing a 25% increase on gasoline himself.  He'll try 10% and keep telling lots of alternate stories to keep his voter base confused.  \n\n- - - - - \nAlso, the confusion is partially intentional.  Trump isn't the only politician who does this.  The idea is that they want us to be confused, upset, eventually angry - but not specifically angry at them. If they can deflect the anger at others - China, people from other parties/religions/countries, poor people, gay/trans people, anybody different... then that anger is useful to the politician & party. As long as we are confused, then we may not have the clarity to understand the game.",

But I swear whenever I'm on social media every other post is about politics and people arguing about whatever political thing of the day. And honestly is so annoying. Even beyond social media I feel like people are very politically polarized (obviously) and at this point, in the United States, democrats and republicans basically don't interact with eachother unless it's to argue about politics. Most democrats from what I've heard refuse to date poeple who have differing political views, and I'm sure the same can be said for many republicans. I'm just so tired of it, when did society, specifically in the united states, become so political? It feels like it's impossible to escape the echo chamber of political arguments everyday.",

Experts pointing at graphs and numbers, saying everything is better, won't change the minds of people who spent their savings and heavy in credit card debt. They went out and voted for change.\n\nPeople upset because prices were higher than they were five years previous, and thus voted for a guy who was, at the time, pledging to put huge tariffs into effect, are, I'm sorry, stupid.",

            "body": "Is there actually a lot of support for the presidents hardline stance on Ukraine? I live in the UK, and I\u2019m absolutely dumbfounded by what I\u2019ve read, to the point where I\u2019m actually starting to question if any of it\u2019s true or just the media we\u2019re being fed. Some of the takeaways from what I\u2019ve read that I don\u2019t get:\n\n1) the Ukraine \u201cwar\u201d - it keeps getting framed as if Americans are cross at Zelenskyy for keeping a war going that he can\u2019t win whilst begging everyone else to pay for it. Is it not well understood that that Ukraine was **invaded**? They didn\u2019t start a war, they were attacked, their land seized and millions of their people displaced. Their only options were fight or be assimilated. He\u2019s definitely pleaded for help and resources but I don\u2019t exactly blame him!\n\n2) Zelenskyy is a dictator - were ya\u2019ll really buying that he was a dictator that \u201crefused\u201d to hold elections? Surely nobody actually expects his to hold an election? It\u2019s not like he can go out and campaign, his country is a war zone. America had an election whilst *at war* but the war wasn\u2019t on American soil, nor was it under occupation, it was a bit different. Ignore all this and you\u2019re still trusting the Russians not to rig it!!\n\n3) The war is costing America billions - there\u2019s an underlying argument that the money would be better spent elsewhere, and even that Zelenskyy is embezzling it, and people want a paper trail to prove he\u2019s not misusing funds. This one I guess I understand to a point, it does cost a lot to support Ukraine with little return. What I don\u2019t get tho, do people actually believe America is bankrolling them? Like literally sending big duffel bags of cash? Weapons and arms, sure, but is there actually people who think Zelenskyy is just stealing money from you?\n\n4) Zelenskyy needs to concede - again, similar to the first point, there seems to be a argument that Zelenskyy is prolonging the war and he\u2019s to blame for the lack of progress in peace negotiations. Putin is not stupid, he\u2019s currently camped on a lot of the ground he wanted to annex from Ukraine. Conceding now is basically just giving him a lot of what he wanted to begin with, whilst Ukraine loses a bunch of its land and resources. I get the feeling the role Zelenskyy has in this war is being majorly misconstrued to the American people.\n\n5) the pro-Russian collective - Is this really a thing now? I think I get why your administration is pals with Putin, an oligarchy probably appeals to Trump. What I don\u2019t get is why his supporters are suddenly alright with this? You guys are famously anti-Russian, now you\u2019re cowing to them? Apollo Creed must be rolling in his grave.",

The opposition right in my country are those who support the Crown Prince, a constitutional monarchy or a Republic lead by the crown prince, capitalism, liberal democracy, and are pro-Israel, and they do not support Russia but believe that Russia is on the right side in this conflict. \n\nI myself support the Crown Prince, I am okay with both a constitutional monarchy or a Republic but I like if it is lead by the crown prince, I support capitalism, liberal democracy, I am pro-Israel but I do not support many actions that Israel is doing, and I am neutral on the Russo-Ukrainian war.\n\nThe opposition left in my country believe that Russia trespassed Ukraine's territory by willing to conquer Crimea, Luhansk, Dontesk, and all of Ukraine and turning them into Russian oblasts, and that Russia wants to destroy Ukraine's sovereignty and feeling as a nation. The left also believe that Trump betrayed Ukraine and are scared that Trump would make peace with the theocracy ruling Iran that would definitely turn Iran into a Middle Eastern North Korea.\n\nOn the other hand the opposition right in my country do not support Russia but believe that Russia is on the right side. They believe that Biden crossed decades of agreements by making Scandinavian countries and countries bordering Russia (except Belarus and Moldova) to join the NATO, and that how Switzerland, Austria, and Ireland who were fully neutral countries (especially Switzerland) started to get closer to the NATO too. They believe that Ukraine in the same time desperately wanted to join the NATO too however Russia got mad about these actions especially concerning the countries in its western border of how Russia has always been vulnerable to its western border especially concerning Ukraine that has the longest border to it. So it decided to invade Ukraine to stop these actions and to mainly stop Ukraine from joining the NATO. Concerning this they see Trump as a person who wants to stop war and wants to turn things into how they were in the agreements, and so they are motivated that Trump won't allow the theocracy to last any longer. \n\nBut now what is the opinion of the left and right especially in the United States, the western world and all other countries in the world?",

But factually they are either lying about making the cuts or lying about saving that much from the budget.",

In order to purchase them, money must be paid. That money is now in circulation, it doesn't remove itself from circulation by buying Bitcoin. Just like when you pay $50 for a share of ABC Co. stock, that $50 isn't removed from circulation, it's now in the pocket of whoever you bought from, and they can spend it how they please.\n\nIf the government just creates a new bank account and types $1,000,000,000 in it and then buys a billion dollars worth of BTC, now the account balance is $0 but there's a billion more dollars in circulation, in the pockets of all those people who sold BTC to the government to spend as they please.",

The US has racked up a *ridiculous* amount of debt, but this is enabled through the power projection it has through a concept known as Pax Americana - the idea that western countries will acquiesce to the US's military presence in their countries, so that we can establish a common foothold, secure safe shipping lanes, and economic prosperity for the entire world. In such a scenario, everyone benefits, *particularly* the United States, since it becomes a very safe and secure place to put your financial trust. Everyone uses the US Dollar for their reserve currency because they trust us not to renege on our deals. Through that, we get to borrow a *SHITLOAD* of money to enable our economy to prosper, far beyond what other sibling nations can do.\n\nStepping back from its role as 'world police' is entirely possible, but would take a long time to do it right; we could reduce the national debt, paying back all of the countries we've borrowed money from, slowly wind down our military presence in our allies' countries to not leave a large power vacuum, establish common rules for trading and shipping, and essentially taking the time and effort to hand the reins over to another entity that was willing to take on that risk and reward. This would be an enormous project, and likely take decades (mostly the paying down the debt thing), but it could be done.\n\nIf, however, someone were to come along and change all of that in the blink of an eye, the damage to the world would be bad (the US has established and oversees a global economy, after all), but the damage to the United States itself would be catastrophic. It's not a far stretch of the imagination (at this point) to suggest that the United States ends up with few allies, little military power spread across the world, untrusting trading partners, and superpowers like China wielding the amount of money the US has borrowed from them, to make the country subservient to its whims, or refuse to pay and invoke a war after its lost all of its allies.\n\nThese were the benefits, and risks that the US undertook when it established Pax Americana ~70 years ago.",

When servers had to be moved, he didn't like the timelines and so he literally just started unplugging servers and getting them into moving trucks.\n\nReddit was abuzz with how much of a moron this guy is. He has made numerous comments over the years also that demonstrate his apparent lack of technical knowledge. And so I was not surprised to see one opinion piece after the other of how he is destroying Twitter.\n\nBut did he really? I mean, I despise this caricature of a man in the strongest terms and I would love to know that he is in fact totally sinking Twitter (now X) but it doesn't look to be the case. Sure, the value of the company did drop, but it has been recovering also and currently they're in talks to raise money at $44B valuation - which is what Musk paid for Twitter. But apart from the valuation of the company, in terms of the influence and the reach of the platform, there are few others that compare.\n\nSo is Elon Musk really the bumbling idiot that people make him out to be or does he perhaps actually know what he's doing?",

If he manages to get funding at that level, I could only assume it's not a legitimate investment, it's buying influence with Musk and, by proxy, Trump. \n\nIf the best you can say about Twitter is that it still exists, I don't think that's a great endorsement of his management. He literally could have done nothing at all and it would be in much better shape. \n\nWhich is not necessarily a condemnation of his management either, since I don't think making the company succeed was really even his goal. He wanted to stop people saying mean things about him and amplify far-right voices, and he did that.",

People like to paint him as this genius who is at once a \"rocket scientist\", electric vehicle \"inventor\" and tech \"expert\". I'm a software engineer and I've seen him make some truly stupid comments on software tech. And when he started culling personnel at Twitter Reddit lit up like a Christmas tree with comments on how stupid he is and how he is sinking Twitter.\n\nBut it doesn't seem to be the case.

Anyone can get Medicaid, provided they are poor enough. Elon, who seems to be running things, has talked about Social Security cuts but this is considered a third rail option that would sink whichever politician deemed responsible for it at the polls. Still Trump lost support with older voters this time around because many suspect him of planning cuts to Medicare or SS. At present though, the only plan indicated is to cut health care assistance to the poor",

This is true. However, critics of the bill still think that is an obtuse process with an undefined outcome which may still impede voter registration.\n\nAs with many things, the devil is in the details.

The birth certificate ONLY comes in if a voter wants to use a form of government ID that doesn't prove US citizenship - the birth certificate would supplement it. Other alternative supplementary IDs are listed, but they're very niche.\n\n~~As it currently stands, the bill does not have any clarification on what happens~~ There's a section that leaves it up to the states to figure out what happens when an ID does not line up with their birth certificate. As you said, this often happens for trans people and married women. Thus, the bill's critics have argued that, without further legal clarification, married women and trans people could be denied access to vote, if they don't have one of the other forms of government ID.\n\nIMO, given that this is an additional option out of a list of 5, the trans/married women issue is a small caveat compared a greater issue: more restrictions, steps, and hurdles being placed on voting, all for the sake of solving a non-issue.",

And then 24 hours later, he caved and said yeah, we'll just pass everything you wanted with no concessions needed. From the perspective of progressive Democrats who wanted to discourage the brinkmanship, he did the complete opposite and demonstrated that brinkmanship is a very effective strategy.\n\nNow, there are some Democrats who truly did want to avoid a shutdown. They just hate the way this went down, because it showed weakness, it rewarded bad behavior, and it more or less conceded the entire agenda to the Republicans at one of the few times that Democrats actually had leverage.\n\nOn Schumer's side, some Democrats were concerned that a shutdown would give even more control of the government to President Trump and Elon Musk.

The life expectancy in the US has been on the decline since covid. There was covid and then the US remains the only wealthy, developed nation without govt-sponsored healthcare for all citizens.\n\nThe reason the average life expectancy like 200 years ago was lower than it is now is not bc ppl dropped dead en masse at 40; it's because many more people died of childhood diseases than they do now thanks to vaccinations. \n\nThere were plenty of ppl living into their 80s and 90s back when, same as today. Advances in all kinds of medical treatments do help extend lifespan even with the average not being dragged down by early childhood mortality, but it's a slower tick up than having a bunch of 2-year-olds dying pulls an average down.

That's not how SS works. It's not a personal savings acct. \n\nSS has ALWAYS been paid to older ppl by the younger people working. Think about how it works -- when it started, people over 65 got benefits. FDR didn't start it by saying 'first, everyone working will pay in for 40 years, then we'll start paying out.' That'd have screwed everyone in the in between. No one is getting screwed. This is how it has, necessarily, always worked. \n\nFor a long time, SS took in more $$ than it was paying out, and that all went into buying bonds and etc and there's a surplus/savings. \n\nRecently, we started using some of the savings bonds. The shortfall will be if those savings get depleted, then the benefits would need to be reduced by 20ish% (IF nothing changes in the next decade) bc it'd only be funded by the $$ coming IN. We can do a lot as that'd be a decade away. They can up the retirement age a bit, they can increase intake, reduce other things, reduce the increases every year,. if the bond yields increase then there's more money and that'd delay the time until there were no more bonds to cash, which would, as above, if nothing else changed, reduce benefits somewhat. It wouldn't end. \n\nAgain, this gets rejiggered all the time. They make long-term projections each year that adjust due to bond yields, working ppl, aging ppl, yada. The projections go out like 75 years.",

Actual ppl trying to actually understand something are fine. \n\nAs to the topic at hand, as above, remember even if nothing changes but the bond yield goes up, the shortfall wouldn't happen in 10 years. I also just looked and we started using the bonds/surplus in 2021. We've got more than 2 trillion in bonds we bought with the overages, that generate like 70billion a year in interest. \n\nIn 2021, one of the funds we draw from was projected to be depleted by 2057, but in the recent projection, it's fine for 75 years from now. This is WHY it's looked at and discussions around it take place every budget, to ensure it keeps going.",

            "body": "I think you would get a lot out of a PBS documentary called \u201cThe Gilded Age\u201d which you can watch for free on YouTube. It\u2019s a fascinating documentary covering the latter decades of the 19th century in the US, specifically the relationship between American politics and the American Industrial Revolution. This \u201cgilded age\u201d was the dawn of America\u2019s ultra-wealthy capitalist class whose increasing wealth relied on the exploitation of factory workers. Eventually workers formed unions and revolted and thus began the tug of war on American politics and government between the gilded wealthy and the working class as each group battled to protect their interests. After watching that documentary, do some digging into the broader political and social landscape in the US around the time of Reagan\u2019s presidency. \n\nThrough both, you will get a much clearer picture of how the values of the U.S.\u2019s two major political parties have shifted over the past 150 years and how corporations have influenced those values, for both parties. Personally, I don\u2019t think anyone can have a true understanding of how we got to where are today without a refresher on this history and re-learning as an adult paints SUCH a different picture than what you were fed in primary school.\n\nAt the end of the day, the relaxing\u2014or outright removal\u2014of regulations (in the name of \u201csmall government\u201d) is always favorable to corporations because regulations are restrictions and restrictions either cost companies money or prevent their ability to quickly maximize their earnings (through things like monopolies and financial shell games). Federal regulations are always put in place to protect current and future citizens: clean water, clean air, clean land, safe working conditions, safe housing conditions, social support for the elderly, disabled, etc. At the same time, federal regulations are effectively constraints on corporations\u2019 activities and limit corporations\u2019 efforts to f*ck over the working class for greater profit. While billionaires SHOULD care about those same things, apparently when you\u2019re rich enough to be a citizen of the world rather than a single country, you can find ways to justify your actions and distance yourself from the horrifying consequences. \n\nAnother hallmark of the rhetoric of \u201csmall government\u201d is cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy in the name of the government being too large. Republicans have long convinced voters that their tax dollars are being wasted and abused and that the way to remedy that is to make government much smaller. They\u2019ve also long convinced working class voters\u2014despite indisputable evidence to the contrary\u2014 that if companies and rich people pay less in taxes, those savings will \u201ctrickle down\u201d to the working class in the form of job creation and new opportunities. So-called \u201ctrickle down economics\u201d has never worked, though. Instead, tax breaks for the wealthy have created an ever-larger wealth gap and those tax cuts have been funded by increasing taxes on the working class directly and indirectly. (Indirectly refers to placing the financial responsibilities for social welfare and environmental protections back on to private citizens by convincing us that we need to start non-profits to do that work).  \n\nThe other thing you\u2019ll see in the Gilded Age\u2014and reinforced over many years in the name of Christianity\u2014is this belief that success and wealth are the result of divine good fortune and indicate the rich\u2019s moral and intellectual superiority. The wealthy have convinced us all that to be poor in this country\u2014in this world\u2014is a personal failure, an intellectual failure, a character flaw, and not the result of the failure of government to protect and provide for ALL of its citizens. \n\nA natural next question, then, is why would the very people who are protected by federal regulations (working class) support a political party that wants to remove those regulations in the name of \u201csmall government\u201d? The answer to that one is rooted in the goal of propaganda: to convince these voters that THEIR rights are being restricted and that their poverty and struggle cannot POSSIBLY be the result of the Republicans! No, there must be another reason and it\u2019s\u2026 black people! And FOREIGNERS! And women! And gay people! And __(insert any marginalized group here)__. Every single authoritarian leader in the history of humanity has played these exact cards in nearly identical sequence and because humans are terrible at learning lessons from the past and believe that we alone are unique snowflakes who can\u2019t possibly be manipulated, it works every time: We are pitted against one another rather than at the actual powers that are keeping us down while the owners of the propaganda are sipping champagne on their yachts and relishing in the cock-fight that keeps the blame at bay. (THIS is why Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, bought the Washington Post).\n\nWhile I am not a Republican voter, I do have to note that the Democratic Party is also in bed with corporations to some extent, primarily because running for federal office in this country has gotten SO expensive, but mostly because this is a capitalist society so wealth and politics are inherently entwined with entirely too much \u201ctit for tat.\u201d That said, the Democratic Party is known for more overt and clear efforts to champion the rights of ordinary citizens compared to the Republican Party. In recent decades, it\u2019s been the Progressive parties and politicians (think: Bernie Sanders and AOC) who have taken over a stronger position on behalf of the working class and poor while correctly pointing out ways the Democratic Party keeps failing the working class.",

You cannot get away from these and similar conflicts of interests.\n\nSecond, when conservatives say small government they usually mean small federal government.  State government should also not be incredibly overbearing (such as the incident when the federal government told a farmer he couldn\u2019t grow his crop in a certain way because it didn\u2019t meet regulations despite the farmer not planning on doing anything with said crop except eat it himself), but the federal government should leave most issues up to the states.\n\nThirdly, conservatives do not believe it is inconsistent to insist on certain \u201cmorality laws\u201d (for lack of a better term) while also holding to freedom of religious expression.

While your religion may say something that can be construed as \u201chomosexuality is wrong\u201d, mine may say \u201cheterosexuality is wrong\u201d. Religious beliefs have no place in politics because anyone can have any religion that can agree specifically with their own viewpoints. \n\nThe Church of Satanism is an excellent example of that. Using laws that have been passed using religious pretense, they\u2019ve even gotten things like the Bible banned from some places. \n\nThen we also fall back to something like the Civil Rights Movement in the 60s. Businesses were saying they wouldn\u2019t allow any African Americans into their business based on that person\u2019s identity. The government stepped up, and in, and fixed that issue. So are you suggesting we allow businesses to go back to a time when they could refuse service for \u201creligious reasons\u201d? Because it very, very quickly can (and will) slip back into using religion as a means of racism, sexism, and whatever \u201cism\u201d is used to describe homosexuality (because I don\u2019t think homophobic is honestly the right term). \n\nAs for smaller government, I agree. We don\u2019t need gadzooks amounts of governmental powers, but we do still need a strong foundation for that government to exist and flourish. But one thing that continuously happens is conservative leaders pushing for tax cuts to the fabulously wealthy, which creates two issues. \n\n1. Significantly fewer tax dollars to go towards public services (ranging from healthcare to infrastructure). \n\n2.

However, these sanctions will probably only last as long as the military conflict continues, since there's no point in punishing Russia for something they're no longer doing. So the sooner the military conflict ends, the sooner prices go back down.\n\nUkraine seems to be the underdog in this battle, so supporting Ukraine would probably mean a much longer, drawn-out conflict until Russia decides to back off. And we can't speed it along by directly involving our own troops without risking the breakout of a much larger war. So my guess is that Trump wants to force this conflict to end as soon as possible, so that he can have a win for the US economy, and his approach has been \"Hey Ukraine, why don't you just give Russia what they want? They're nice folks, I'm sure they'll be nice to you.\"\n\nThat's just one theory.

NATO would still have a nuclear deterrent through the UK and France, which on paper would discourage an outright invasion of a NATO member, though less so than it did when the US' arsenal was also a factor.\n\nHowever, I'd wager the departure of the US would spark a domino effect within NATO, based around collapsing confidence. In the event of war with Russia and without the US to contribute or divide their attention, the UK and France would likely bear the full brunt of Russian nuclear strikes in an attempt to disable their own nuclear arms first. This may leave them more hesitant to fulfil their obligations for the sake of somewhere as small and distant as the Baltic States, or even prompt them to follow the US in departing the organisation. If NATO loses the confidence of its nuclear members, the non-neighbouring members like Canada, Italy, Spain, Germany etc. would likely follow suit, leaving the remainder to fend for itself. The more states leave, the higher burden is placed on the ones that remain, prompting them to leave even faster.\n\nIf this cascade occurs, all Russia would have to do is wait for the right moment to kick the door in, and from their perspective at worst they'll fight a weaker alliance or at best NATO will disintegrate and its neighbours will choose between being invaded or renegotiating their relationships in Russia's favour.\n\nRegardless of the ultimate scale of a conflict, though, the US leaving NATO would certainly encourage Russia to become more boldly militaristic in its approach to its neighbours.",

Following his takeover of the website, Twitter unbanned the accounts of hate groups and notable people who were banned for saying offensive things.  \n\nWhen Musk ultimately performed a Nazi salute while on stage at Trump's inauguration, that was final straw that sparked a mass ban of Twitter links on Reddit.  \n\nThat also kind of answers the original question.

Jews who escaped Germany in the 1930s were generally leaving \\*early\\* -- 1932, maybe early 1933 -- before the net tightened. And Europe had a lot of countries contiguous to Germany.

But anyhow, let me try & get this straight\u2026. \n\nThe U.S. is slapping tariffs on Canadian goods supposedly because Canadians (or as Trump puts it, \u201cthe too many immigrants and refugees we allow into our country\u201d) are transporting drugs across the border into America. First of all, wouldn\u2019t that point more to a failure on the U.S. side of the border? Like\u2026 it\u2019s not Canadians working American customs. If your border agents can\u2019t do proper search and seizure, that\u2019s not Canada\u2019s problem; that\u2019s a direct reflection of your own internal incompetence. Yes? No?\n\nSecond, if Trump is mad that other countries are now imposing retaliatory tariffs on American products, maybe he should take a long look in the mirror (although he probably thinks his reflection is Deep State propaganda). He started the trade war. He\u2019s the one who escalated it for no coherent reason, other than the fact that he has no grasp on political history, economics, or literally anything beyond his ego. You can\u2019t start a fight, get punched back, and then act like the victim. \n\nAlso, can we talk about how counterproductive these tariffs are for America\u2019s own economy. He\u2019s literally making American-made products more expensive to export and produce. The whole point of tariffs is supposedly to protect domestic industry, but if your costs go up and your global trade relationships tank, you\u2019re just shooting yourself in the foot. It\u2019s like putting a Band-Aid on your forehead for a stubbed toe. \n\nAnd weren\u2019t half of you hyped about voting for him because he said he\u2019d lower the cost of eggs or something? I mean, to each their own, but I personally prioritize things like human rights over cheap eggs. Maybe I\u2019m just biased because (1) I\u2019m Canadian and (2) I have a functioning brain that can recognize that the so-called \u201cleader of the free world\u201d is a complete knob\u2026.

Trump had toyed with presidential campaigns before, most notably in 2000, but he'd never actually committed to an election, let alone won one, until 2016. It was taken for granted that a serious presidential candidate would need some experience in public office or the military until he proved otherwise.\n\nThe other half of it was his politics and personality. You can look up campaign footage from Mitt Romney in 2012 or John McCain in 2008 and see how Trump is a different breed of politician. He's not a soft-spoken Bush-styled neoconservative; he's a nativist, a populist and a loudmouth. He was a break from both the prior Republican Party political platform and from how an electable candidate was expected to behave. 2016 in some ways signified the shift from television to social media as the dominant platform for political campaigning, and Trump was practically built for that new environment.\n\nOn all of these factors, and more, Trump was severely underestimated in both the 2016 Republican primaries and into the election itself. Many Democrats in particular failed to predict how strongly Trump's policies would resonate with voters in the former Blue Wall of the Rust Belt, which they'd been successfully holding for over 25 years at that point. \n\nIt was like *The Guns of August*, the conventional wisdom had become outdated but few realised until the conventions broke.",

Border patrol presence is significantly higher on the southern border plus you have the cartels to deal with (whose business is drugs and human trafficking). So I can see a potential for an argument to be made that it\u2019s not being caught on the northern border because there are far fewer agents and searches. But to me that\u2019s a what if argument. I\u2019ve crossed the Canadian/us border many times and the us/mexico a few times. The difference is impressive. If we look at it one way there is a possibility that there could be a lot more and we are just not catching it. But the same possibility exists that we are actually catching a larger percentage of the northern borders  and there really isn\u2019t much. If I look at the whole scenario from Mexico through Canada I feel like it I can see an argument that the amount of drugs going into Canada from the us is actually higher than the amount coming into the us from Canada. To me the logistics are it originates in china, exported to Mexico, from Mexico it crosses the southern border into the US and from there a percentage makes its way into Canada. I see this being the dominant and likely scenario. Yes I\u2019m a free thinking conservative. Technically fiscally conservative socially liberal. Basically middle of the road.

The summary at the top of the Wikipedia page can explain substantive due process well enough, but essentially the concept is that the court can establish and protect rights that aren't specifically enumerated in the Constitution through it.\n\nBut note that the rights aren't *specifically enumerated.* In other words they're relying **entirely** on a court ruling saying there's a right there and protecting it, for that right to actually have protection, and the problem is the court can go back later and overturn the earlier decision just like they did. Relying solely on a court decision is shaky because it can always be overturned later. The best possible scenario would have been for abortion rights to become part of the Constitution, because there's a high bar for making any change to the Constitution, and if it had been accomplished then there would be an equally high bar to remove it later. That was not accomplished.\n\nBecause it is not a specifically enumerated right, it has no protection unless it had it through legislation or court decision, and now that is gone. And also because of that, a federal ban is possible so long as Congress can find a way to spin it as being within Federal purview, since there are some limitations on what kind of reach Fed has as part of Fed-State dual sovereignty. But also, Federal protection through legislation is also possible through the same scheme, as long as Congress can spin it as being within Federal purview.\n\nAll *Dobbs* did was remove the ruling giving guaranteed access.

Which countries?  Which tariffs?  Are they universal like Trump is threatening to enact or targeted to protected certain industries?  Tariffs are not all the same.

In fact, it seems like every country has these for pretty much every other country as a way to not have the domestic market flooded with international products, killing local businesses. And even beyond that, it seems like the US had priorities for imports into Canada for many of the products that are being brought up, meaning they were either exempt from a lot of the tariff-rate quotas, or they had priority in imports prior to the quotas being met.

As you've seen, some people grasp at straws and gesture wildly to try to make it *sound* like there were high tariffs, but if you dig into it, those policies were so mundane that they were nearly irrelevant.\n\nPresident Trump keeps complaining about the current state of the trade agreement between the US and Canada. There is something very weird about that complaint, though -- that agreement that he keeps complaining about was negotiated *by President Trump* during his first term in office. At the time, he celebrated the agreement as one of the signature achievements of his presidency. Why does he hate it now? That's really not clear.

They've been living in la-la land for literal decades, getting high on their own supply, and now the rubber is hitting the road where they've installed 'their one true savior', who's really an incompetent buffoon, and he's making *enormous* political mistakes each and every day because their fantasy and reality simply cannot coincide. He can't go around the world bullying people and applying blanket tariffs and maintain good trading alliances. He can't bully Ukraine into sacrificing itself for his own benefit. He can't reduce the deficit single-handed, and pay for all of the stuff he's promised. All of the promises he made are simply not coming true.\n\nAnd so, Americans are getting pissed off, and they'll be really pissed off when the economy tanks - which is an inevitability, even if Trump chickens out of his tariffs tomorrow, but accelerates if he doesn't. \n\nReality will hit conservatives like a ton of bricks in the coming months, and Democrats are well-positioned to take control in 2026 and beyond as the 'return to normal' party (assuming Trump doesn't do something utterly catastrophic in the meantime, but since we're talking about what strategy is needed to win the next election I assume we're working off this assumption).",

There is no law that says it is a criminal offense to be in the country beyond the stay provided by a work visa, vacation claims, exchange student entry, etc. Something of note is that the political party that has run on this platform for several decades, has had many opportunities to enact such a law, particularly during Bush Jr.'s tenure, but chose not to do it.\n\nOn the flip-side, when your fellow citizens tell you that they 'support undocumented immigrants', they're not telling you they want criminals to enter the country's borders illegally, and stay here. They're normally trying to tell you they want to give these people a pathway to citizenship since they've gone to the effort to get here, have been living/working here, and are continuing to do so and it would be in everyone's best interests if they weren't treated like 'vermin' or slave labor.\n\nNow, if you disagree with that, let's have a conversation about the merits and pitfalls of undocumented immigration.

What do you think?\n\nThat's not fact. \n\nTrump didn't even get a majority of the vote, and only like 60% of eligible voters turned out. \n\nAbout 2/3 of the country want abortion legal in all or most cases (which is why every single state measure regarding abortion has gone to the choice side, save the one in Fla that required 60% and fell just shy) - [https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/)\n\nAbout 60% of Americans favour stricter regulations on guns (and remember, only 1/3 of the population even owns a gun, so that jibes).

Canada and the US have been allies for the better part of a century. \n\nOn the other hand, the Trump administration is treating Canada in a very hostile way. Among other things, President Trump has disputed the validity of the long-established border between Canada and the US, which implicitly means he thinks some of that territory should be annexed by the US. President Trump has also repeatedly said that Canada as a whole should become part of the US, and that Canadians should welcome this. He has also claimed that the Canadian government is illegitimate and cannot protect Canadians, and that Canadian tariffs are a threat to innocent Americans (leaving aside the simple fact that Trump is the one who started this trade war). A lot of this is similar to rhetoric that other countries have used before launching invasions over \"disputed\" territory. \n\nIt seems unthinkable, and yet, President Trump is clearly laying all this rhetorical groundwork for *something*, and it sure doesn't seem friendly.",

Cult is the one word that sums up the American Republican Party and its supporters at the moment. A charismatic leader who tells you everyone else but him is lying to you. This means he can do whatever he wants and the Republicans find any excuse to justify it. He said it himself, he could shoot someone point blank on camera and he wouldn\u2019t lose any supporters. So when he tells them it\u2019s a good thing to ruin geopolitical relations, they support him. On and on. Unfortunately, a little over half of America voted for him. Republicans also won the majority over Congress and the Senate. Not all Americans want this, but the Democrats and everyday people are powerless. It is a very scary, and dark time for our country.

            "body": "Tariffs are a tax on imports. By taxing imports very selectively and in a targeted fashion, tariffs *can be used* to protect local industry from global competition (foreign goods get more expensive, domestic goods don't), which the US already does in several industries via a combination of carefully targeted tariffs, import bans and \"buy America\" laws, collectively referred to as protectionism or protectionist policies. For instance, the government is required to only buy American-made trains. Only American-made ships can ship cargo domestically. Meat products are almost impossible to import. Cars have significant tariffs imposed unless they're assembled here in the US. And so forth.\n\nProtectionist policies are straightforwardly harmful to people in other countries who want to export to us. They *might be* good for Americans in some cases. It has worked internationally, for instance, to help developing economies start up industrial sectors from scratch. There is not a ton of justification for it in America given that we're the global top economically, but protectionism could still be a useful policy tool in very specific situations. Additionally, protectionist policies are very popular with very specific domestic parties who benefit. If you are, for instance, one of America's only train manufacturers, then you may be extremely happy to bribe (\"contribute to campaigns of\") politicians to make sure the policy stays in place even if the original justification no longer applies. If you are, for instance, a car or a plane manufacturer, maybe you additionally benefit from that policy, since it makes trains inefficient and impractical as an alternative. So there's a lot of potential for outright corruption there as well.\n\nTrump's tariffs are not selective or targeted. They are very broad, and include *industrial inputs\\** (the last thing you'd want to tax, given that it makes it harder to develop industry), and the justification for them keeps shifting. First it's a bargaining chip, then it's protectionist, then it's to browbeat Canada into controlling the flow of drugs across the border (there are almost no drugs flowing across the border). Economists and professionals who work in trade are confused and angry. If the tariffs continue, prices for various things will go up - prices of imported goods, prices of domestic goods produced with imported inputs, and prices of domestic goods that are now no longer competing with imported goods. Additionally, lots of people on both side of the border will lose their jobs. The stock market may tank as well, though that's never guaranteed since stocks don't have a very straightforward relationship to the business environment.\n\nAdditionally, since tariffs are aggressive towards other countries, they usually respond with tariffs of their own in a tit-for-tat retaliation. Good presidents usually work hard for their entire term to get favorable terms of trade for both imports and exports with other countries. Trump is getting unfavorable terms of trade for both imports and exports (exports will be subject to the retaliatory tariffs) for no benefit.\n\n(\\* This was the plan when tariffs were proposed in his campaign, but because the administration is so chaotic, plan are not reliable and information is scarce, so I'm not up to date on the details of what happened just this week.)",

            "body": "It's pretty simple. \"Free trade\" is just when you can export and import goods without any additional costs. The opposite of this is \"protectionism\". The idea here is to \"protect\" your domestic producers of goods by making it less profitable to simply import the good from somewhere overseas. Tariffs are a tool that protectionists use to cut into the profits of importing cheaply produced goods, making the domestically produced goods cheaper to buy than foreign produced goods. It's literally just a tax on imported goods. \n\nAll numbers in the following example are purely hypothetical. \n\nSo say you want to build some building. You need steel beams. You can buy steel beams from a foundry in Michigan for $100,000. Or you can IMPORT the same amount of steel beams from a foundry in China for $90,000. The foundry in China can sell them to you cheaper because they don't have to pay their workers as much as a worker in a Michigan foundry gets paid. If the Michigan foundry sold you the beams for $90k, they could actually just be losing money. That's why they need to charge more for the same product.\n\nThe US government doesn't like this. It wants to encourage builders to buy from the Michigan foundry so they say \"All steel beam IMPORTS are going to get an additional 20% tax\". Now all of a sudden, the $90,000 beams from China cost you $108,000. So it is actually cheaper to buy from the Michigan foundry. The problem for consumers is that, the constructors of the building aren't just going to be willing to eat that lost profit. So in turn, they charge more money from whoever they are constructing the building for. The consumer always ends up paying more for tariffed goods even though the tariff itself is paid by the importer, not the consumer. Whoever imported the good is just going to increase the amount of money they ask from the consumer. \n\nWhen governments start tariff wars, the consumers are the ones who end up footing the bill. Tariffs can be useful in some circumstances. But Trump is merely using them as a political tool. He doesn't care that it's actively going to hurt Americans.",

Only once have they succeeded, and that was in 2021. The vote of no confidence directed at our defence minister in 2017 is still talked about, although mainly because of how strange it was because he was one of the few in the cabinet who was doing a good job and had wide support. Two other ministers chose to step down instead of facing a vote of no confidence at the same time, and that is remembered as well. \n\nThese votes of no confidence are regularly brought up again, as they are quite uncommon and since they are only ever brought up when things are really serious, and are strong voices even when they don\u2019t succeed. They are talked about, because it\u2019s a tool that is not wielded lightly.",

It's also predictable that an impeachment will fail because a conviction requires a 67 seat supermajority in the Senate, which the Democrats realistically cannot achieve in the 2026 Senate races. Only seven Republican Senators defected last time, and four of them have coincidentally retired since then. Trump would not resign nor even acknowledge the threat of a third impeachment because he knows from the last two that it can't actually pass.\n\nCompared to your examples, there won't be anything to talk about, especially if the House Democrats initiate proceedings now whilst in minority because it will simply die on the House floor before it even officially begins.",

Politicians wouldn\u2019t be the judges of whether a crime had been committed or not. And the only one technically not accountable to courts is the king.

So if Congress is unwilling to impeach there is no criminal liability while the president is in office, only civil checks by the judiciary that they're actions are within their powers, hence why the criminal indictments against Trump were dismissed, discharged or otherwise paused once it become clear he would president again.\n\nI suppose part of the answer to your original question is that the US is undergoing somewhat of a constitutional crisis in that regard.",

I\u2019m sure someone else will have a better answer, but this is my understanding of it. \nFor someone to become a long-term dictator, say the funny orange man, the 22nd amendment would need to be repealed or amended as it created the two-term limit. As we know, Congress would have to propose an amendment and have it pass through three fourths of state legislatures. \n\nRepealing the amendment altogether would be an incredibly difficult task, with enough uproar from the American people to make January 6th look like daycare. But Trump and his cronies are sneaky, and there are a few workarounds. \n\nThere is no language in the Constitution barring a former two-termed President from becoming the Speaker of the House. Of course we haven\u2019t seen that, but it\u2019s not mentioned in the language of the Constitution. The presidential succession order would put the former-President current-Speaker second in line for the presidency. If something mysterious happened to the President and VP, guess who\u2019s up to bat. I don\u2019t know which would take precedence: a President\u2019s inability to have more than two terms or the Speaker\u2019s successive right to the power?\n\nAnother workaround, which I find the most likely scenario should they try to play this out, would be an alteration to the 22nd amendment that would allow for third terms, or even extended terms, perhaps during a time of war or other uncertainty. They\u2019ll spin it in a way that makes it seem like it\u2019s for the good of the country to have a persistent leader: after all, it would only be temporary! Right?? \ud83d\ude43\n\nSeeing as how we\u2019re about two inches from another World War, the dismantling of the Constitution, wartime propaganda, and immense nationalism would be swiftly pushed on the American people. \nJust my theory, but feels the most plausible in the event that the conservys want to get freaky and make us into 21st century Germany.",

There's a common confusion that billionaires have literally a billion or more in the bank, swimming in bullion and bills like Scrooge McDuck. More commonly though, they're billionaires *on paper.* It's ownership of assets. It's value, not cold hard cash. If you had absolutely nothing to your name but the clothes on your back, well those are $30 jeans and a $15 shirt, $2 socks, $3 underwear, and $50 shoes. So you have $0 in the bank but you're still worth $100 because you have $100 worth of apparel. But those gains are unrealized until you actually sell some apparel and turn it into money.\n\nThe problem with taxing wealth is, unless a constitutional amendment is made, it's simply impossible. Direct taxes are subject to apportionment. The reason we even have income taxes, which have been struck down before, is because the response was to make an amendment allowing the collection of income taxes and specifying it's not subject to apportionment. It's certainly not impossible to make another amendment but the bar is quite high.\n\nBut of course we're going under the assumption that they aren't paying their fair share, but is that always the case? What if they pay their income taxes without jumping through loopholes, just like we at the bottom do? They're following the rules and paying exactly what the law says to, which is 37% on income above $609,350. If they're doing nothing with their stakes and shares, and just drawing a salary of $1M a year and just filing a regular old return, their effective tax rate for Fed is 32.28%. Someone pulling $100K is paying 13.84%. This is just Fed and not anything else. There are arguments to be made about the reduced effective rate of FICA taxes since they cap out, and any relevant state/local tax if applicable, or what would be an appropriate top end bracket.",

It can be seen as posturing to encourage people not to start a war as it means that a blitzkrieg or hoping for a quick victory would be likely to fail. \n\nThink of it like this with Russia going into the Ukraine, at the beginning their hope was to get it done in hours, to just go in and stomp it. BUT they were able to hold out for long enough to start fighting back and it's dragged on for years. If you know going in that it's going to be years that can make a lot of people double take on wondering if it's worth it.\n\nChina in particular would need to make a statement as they're kinda one of the Big 4 groups. You've got the US, Russia, the EU, and China as the four groups with weapons/military, landmass, money, and frankly a horse in the race. That's not to discount Africa, South America, Australia, or any other region, but they tend to throw in with others as support rather than being the one getting top billing.\n\nAs to if WW3 is about to break out. I'd say no, not immediately. If there was to be something at the moment based on current information, it would likely be satellite wars and civil wars influenced by the others. Think how Vietnam and Korea were heavily influenced by both the US and Russia, or even going back further how France helped A LOT with the American Revolution as it hurt the British.\n\nWhat would start a full blown World War would be trump doing something MONUMENTALLY stupid like making good on one of his promises by force. Like if he tried to invade Greenland, or Gaza, as that would force so many countries to go active because of alliances like WW1. It's why Russia in the Ukraine didn't start a World War because the Ukraine was a legal shitshow for decades. Like had Russia invaded Finland it would have created a World War because Finland is in Nato and that gives them more protection.",

While presidents are the focal point of the election, their VP is also being picked with that same vote, and there's a sort of implicit acknowledgement that should something happen to the President, the VP becomes president.\n\nBut Harris also had to present similarly to Clinton, and for the same reasons. They were in a popularity contest in America, not part of the lineage or married into power or in Eurasia with their differences in culture.

            "body": "Hear me out: I\u2019m very familiar with how executives twist things and plan for an outcome. Which is what the current cabinet is exhibiting. It just seems bleak out there so I came up with a Sherlock style playbook. You think this might be true? \n\nPhase 1: Public Disruption (Surface-Level Chaos)\n\n\t\u2022\tHigh-Profile Confrontation: The U.S. administration, led by Trump and Hegseth, stages an aggressively confrontational meeting with Zelenskyy. This is designed to appear like a diplomatic breakdown, signaling a major shift in U.S. policy toward Ukraine.\n\t\u2022\tCyber Retraction: The U.S. halts offensive cyber operations against Russia, giving the impression of appeasement. This move is meant to increase Russian confidence while raising alarm among European allies.\n\t\u2022\tLeaks & Media Frenzy: U.S. insiders leak conflicting reports: some say Trump is cutting off Ukraine completely, others hint at secret military aid continuing. This deliberate contradiction fuels speculation, making it impossible to pinpoint the administration\u2019s real intent.\n\n\nPhase 2: Shifting the Battlefield (Indirect Manipulation)\n\n\n\t\u2022\tControlled Arms Flow: Instead of officially approving aid, U.S. intelligence allows American-made weapons to flow through private networks in third-party nations (e.g., Poland, Turkey, or even via black market channels). This makes U.S. involvement deniable while keeping Ukraine militarily afloat.\n\t\u2022\tEuropean Panic Button: The sudden public breakdown with Ukraine forces Germany, France, and the UK to reconsider their own defense policies. Fearing U.S. withdrawal, they accelerate their arms commitments to Ukraine\u2014essentially forcing NATO to step up without American leadership.\n\t\u2022\tChina\u2019s Dilemma: By creating the illusion of U.S. disengagement, China now has to decide whether to:\n\t1.\tDouble down on support for Russia\u2014which would put Beijing at economic risk if the West retaliates.\n\t2.\tStay out of it, which weakens Russia by depriving them of key technology and logistical backing.\nEither choice benefits the U.S.: If China overcommits, it becomes the next global target for economic containment. If it stays out, Russia weakens faster.\n\n\nPhase 3: Reversed Expectations (Setting the Trap)\n\n\n\t\u2022\tRussia Takes the Bait: Seeing U.S. disengagement and Europe scrambling, Putin overextends, pushing for major offensives into Ukraine. However, the hidden arms flow ensures that Ukrainian forces are better prepared than Russia anticipates.\n\t\u2022\tCovert Cyber Reengagement: While the U.S. publicly halts cyber operations, a classified team within the NSA continues under a different designation (e.g., as a \u201cdefensive research initiative\u201d). This allows the U.S. to monitor and manipulate Russian communications without them realizing the full extent.\n\t\u2022\tDiplomatic Checkmate: After months of chaos, Trump suddenly re-enters negotiations\u2014but now, Russia is facing economic and battlefield setbacks while Europe has taken on the burden. The U.S. now has maximum leverage to dictate the terms.\n\n\nPhase 4: The Grand Reveal (Delayed Victory)\n\n\n\t\u2022\tFinal Blow to Russia: The war drags on just long enough to cause severe economic strain on Russia. Meanwhile, the U.S. quietly supports internal dissent through economic pressure, black ops, and propaganda campaigns.\n\t\u2022\tChina\u2019s Backlash: If China had supported Russia, it now faces a hostile European market, potentially fracturing its economic stability.\n\t\u2022\tU.S. Resurgence: Having forced NATO to strengthen, weakened Russia, and outmaneuvered China, the U.S. re-emerges as the indispensable global power, without having directly engaged in a costly war.\n\nHidden Outcome: The True Victory\n\n\n\t\u2022\tThe world believes the U.S. disengaged and failed Ukraine, while in reality, it orchestrated a rebalancing of power:\n\t\u2022\tRussia is crippled economically and militarily.\n\t\u2022\tNATO is stronger than before and no longer reliant on the U.S.\n\t\u2022\tChina is forced into a lose-lose situation.\n\t\u2022\tThe U.S. remains dominant, while appearing to have taken a backseat.",

The major powers have spent the last 76 years making sure it is not. Pretty early on, it was recognized that a surprise decapitation strike, could overwhelm a country and prevent a response. The US refers to this hypothetical type of attack as a \"Bolt out of the blue\" and they've spent more than a half of a century countering it. What that looks like today is [missile silos](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_launch_facility) scattered around the country ready to fire [ICBM's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile) at a moments notice. [B-2's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_B-2_Spirit) scattered around the globe ready to take off at a moments notice to drop [gravity bombs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/B83_nuclear_bomb). [Ballistic missile submarines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Alabama_(SSBN-731)) around the world ready to fire [SLBM's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/UGM-133_Trident_II) at a moments notice. The [SBIRS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-Based_Infrared_System) system which can detect missile launches in less than 3 seconds anywhere in the world, as well as an extensive [radar system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_State_Phased_Array_Radar_System) that confirms what SBIRS is saying. There is no mechanism for a Bolt out of the Blue to turn into a decapitation strike on the US, without an American response. It's impossible.

            "body": "In light of recent political events in the US I\u2019d like to ask those more knowledgeable than myself a question about an idea that might seem off-putting and somewhat distopian to many, and maybe downright scary to some but I feel it has to be adressed. \n\nLet me start by saying that I strongly believe Trump was, for the most part, elected by the dumber part of the American society. They are dissatisfied, and gullible so Trump, with his populistic approach, was able to convince them he\u2019s the only one with the correct answer to their many problems while the brighter part of the same nation was able to see through the orange facade. \n\nSo now the question, do you think that votes should have a weight to them, proportional to one\u2019s IQ? So 1.2 for someone with an IQ of 120 and 0.8 for someone with 80. What do you think the disadvantages of such an aproach could be, and do you think they would outweigh the potential benefits? \n\nMy reasoning is the following - and I know I\u2019m simplifying things, but I\u2019ve come pretty far by doing so in the past when making big decisions. Let\u2019s imagine a family, with two children in their early teens, that\u2019s planning to move to another city because both mom and dad have gotten much better job offerings, and the place where they are currently residing is basically a shit hole. While it\u2019s normal of you to ask your children what they think about that idea, and even put some weight to their wishes because you symphatize with them for losing their friends, it would be completely mad to have a fully democratic decision in which the two votes of the children would have the same weight as those of the the grown-ups. Yeah, I know, a family is not a country, but you get my point. \n\nThe problem, as I see it, is how to that in practical terms.\n\nNow, please hit me with your criticism and your ideas as to why this would be a bad, bad thing to do. I\u2019m honestly curious, and probably a bit dumb myself. I didn\u2019t vote Republican, though. Sadly, Europeans are forbidden to do so. \ud83d\ude09",

It gives everyone a voice, so that they can participate in politics by exercising that voice. When people's voices are diminished relative to other people, *even in a way that makes sense to improve the quality of decision-making* (which is not to say that your proposal would accomplish that), then that is counterproductive to the core benefit of democracy. The more alienated some citizens get from politics - the more that the public communications sphere is dominated by the ultrarich, the more that some people's votes matter more than others in the electoral college, the more that people in swing states have a more valuable vote than people in safe states, the more that states can decide who to label a felon and then take away felons' voting rights - the more that democracy is failing in its core mission.\n\nWhen the peaceful exercise of one's political rights is suppressed, then tyrants rise and violence, chaos and oppression ensue. And eventually, the tyrants are hung by their innards and the whole cycle repeats again. So I wouldn't recommend finding additional ways to disenfranchise people. People with \"low IQ\" are just as capable of erecting a gallows as anyone else.",

There are also enormous logistical and conceptual problems such as \u201cwho defines who is intelligent enough?\u201d \u201cHOW do you even define intelligence?\u201d We still have a very poor grasp of the concept scientifically and have very little understanding of its neural correlates. \n\nAnother problem: who would you rather have the right to vote - a well-meaning citizen with an IQ of 90 who spends all day informing herself about politics, or a 150 IQ far-right fascist who doesn\u2019t care about fairness and wants only to game the system in his favor? \n\nOnce you have a designated subgroup that has the authority to restrict another subgroup from voting, you no longer have a democracy. Even if the levels and definitions of intelligence were crystal clear, it\u2019s still highly problematic to assume that this factor more than any other is so detrimental to our political system that it justifies removing the rights of large portions of the population.\n\nI know you\u2019re not entirely removing suffrage rights in your example, but the end result is effectively the same since you\u2019re deciding who has a greater say in their leaders.",

Wants to  terminate the Inflation Reduction Act and offshore wind. \n\nFederal Workforce \u2013 Job cuts and restrictions on collective bargaining agreements for unionized workers.\n\nHealth \u2013 Removing the \u201cnon-binary\u201d or \u201cother\u201d gender options from medical and federal documents. Withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization.\n\nTrade \u2013 the % increase on  tariffs. Which is currently taking shape so it\u2019s increasing the prices of electricity, gasoline, and other necessities.\n\nSpending Cuts \u2013 Reductions in Medicaid and agriculture funding, primarily affecting SNAP benefits.\n\nEducation and Workforce \u2013 Cutting nutrition programs, including school breakfast and lunch programs for low-income children. Shutting down the Department of Education.\n\nSpending Increases \u2013 Redirecting funds from these cuts to increase spending on border security, the judiciary, and homeland security. Additional funding for the armed forces to strengthen border security.\n\nTax Cuts \u2013 Lowering tax rates for almost all Americans, with the wealthiest taxpayers benefiting the most.\n\nTHIS IS A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION/SITUATION: What do you think would happen if a bill to stop government funding were passed? This question also applies to those who still support Trump\u2014how do you think it would affect you, your family, or your friends if you or they rely on government assistance? Would it make you reconsider your support for Trump?\nThe hypothetical question is for if any of these bills get passed.",

Cameras were poised, the crew silent, the room bathed in the glare of studio lights. The moment was ripe with anticipation.\n\n\u201cMr President, you\u2019re live in 3, 2\u2014\u201c the director signalled silently with his fingers.\n\nAs Trump inhaled deeply to begin his carefully prepared speech, a sudden look of discomfort flashed across his face. His cheeks turned crimson, beads of sweat forming on his brow. A violent rumble filled the silence, breaking all decorum.\n\nA collective gasp rose from the assembled advisors and camera crew. Trump shifted awkwardly, attempting to regain composure, but it was too late. Fueled by his unfortunate lunch of three-day-old Big Macs, an explosive accident erupted with shocking force, spraying wildly in all directions.\n\nElon Musk, who had been standing nearby enthusiastically discussing his latest innovation, found himself directly in the line of fire. He staggered backward, stunned and speechless, covered in the catastrophic spray.\n\nVice President JD Vance, realising the impending disaster, lunged dramatically over a nearby couch in a desperate bid to escape. In his haste, his trousers caught on the armrest, ripping away entirely as he landed awkwardly on the floor behind it. He peeked over the edge, pants-less and red-faced with disbelief.\n\n\u201cCut the cameras!\u201d someone yelled frantically.\n\nStaffers scrambled in panic, shielding their noses and mouths with folders, jackets, and anything within reach. Secret Service agents, known for their unwavering composure, rushed to open windows, but it was futile\u2014the stench had already begun its relentless conquest of the White House.\n\nMoments later, aides stumbled into the hallways, coughing and gagging. Reporters waiting outside exchanged confused and amused glances as senior officials emerged red-faced and gasping for air.\n\nTrump, frozen in humiliation, watched helplessly as the incident cemented itself into legend, whispered and laughed about for decades within the corridors of political power.",

The US is one of several countries that had been providing Ukraine with assistance in this fight. \n\nHowever, each US president has their own take on the situation. Donald Trump, our new President since January 20th, seems to want to wind down US support for Ukraine. Trump launched peace talks with Russia without inviting Ukraine or other nations to attend. Trump has also insisted that Ukraine should sign over valuable mineral rights to the US; depending on your perspective, this may be a shrewd move, or a deeply cynical one. \n\n>why was there like 50 people in the room\n\nLots of support staff and translators, plus reporters. World leaders rarely meet alone. \n\n>I get war is bad, but why the fuck are we even involved in any of these talks?? does this war have any direct impact (besides wasting money) on anyone here in the US??\n\nRussia has been one of our most powerful geopolitical rivals over the last century. There have been times that we cooperated together, and times that we were at odds with each other. Essentially, the US and Russia are constantly trying to outmaneuver each other and gain some kind of global advantage. Anything that makes us stronger makes Russia weaker. Anything that makes Russia stronger makes the US weaker. \n\nSo, if you're telling me that we can decimate the military force of one of our most dangerous rivals for just a few hundred billion dollars to support a proxy war, and no US soldiers are put at risk, I would say we have a definite interest in making that happen.",

Like full on riots? I see footage of peaceful protests here and there but honestly, what does that do anymore? Are people just beaten down so badly due that they feel they can't afford to do this? Do they think/know it's a futile effort? In other countries e.g. Europe there have been full scale riots for less.",

Likewise, there is nothing in President Trump's budget proposal that indicates he would want to send $5k to every American. Doing anything like that would require approval from Congress, so the fact it's missing from the budget proposal that Congress is voting on seems significant.",

Expect some tax cuts that benefit you a tiny amount temporarily, and benefit the 0.01% thousands of times more, permanently. \n\n>I'm glad my vote for Trump is paying off. \n\nYou have not actually received any tangible benefit yet, have you?
