            "body": "Batteries in internal combustion engine cars aren't meant to deliver substantial energy. They are lead-acid batteries and designed for producing a lot of current when starting the engine (\"cranking amps\"). That's why they are sold and labeled as such - the cold cranking rating will usually be inscribed on it. Discharging such a battery more than just for starting the car damages it very quickly.\n\n\nIn contrast, marine batteries or deep cycle batteries are meant to, well, deep cycle i.e. provide energy for a period of time.\n\n\n\nCranking batteries aren't meant to be discharged at all. They are meant to start the engine and be immediately recharged when the engine is running. It just so happens that all the car's accessories are also powered through the same 12V bus and you can tap into the battery for limited amounts of time. Having the radio or a light for a few minutes is insignificant with respect to the size of the battery, but that's about it.\n\n\nTo answer the question, there is no battery state of charge indication because cranking batteries aren't meant to be discharged.",

It 1) runs the lights radio etc AND 2) recharges the battery from the energy it lost from the start / cranking. This is how if your alternator dies while driving your battery will power the load for a while until it runs out too. This is also how once you jumpstart a car the alternator runs and charges the battery backup - this is why you are told to run the car (not turn it off) for 30-40 minutes after a jumpstart, so the alternator can charge the battery up again for the next start.",

A battery in good health should be around 12.6v-13v (with the engine off). By the time it gets down to an even 12v, it's already in need of a recharge as it only has about 25% of a useful charge remaining. The battery is considered dead somewhere around 11.8v, though you *might* see it work as low as 11.5v, but only just barely.\n\nI'd wager your gauge is way off if you're seeing anything at all happening at even 11v, nevermind 9v.",

The alternator is constantly charging the battery while the engine is running (and the battery voltage isn't at it's limit), so it's almost semantics to say that the battery is running the car's electronic devices. But in reality it's the battery running those devices while the alternator is constantly topping up the battery. This should be obvious as many lights/systems turn on when you get in the car BEFORE the engine (alternator) is running.\n\nThere are two main reasons there isn't a battery percentage displayed.  \n\n1) it doesn't make sense in most cases. As others pointed out, it's just different with car batteries.  Go back a few decades and it really didn't make any sense.  Besides there IS a volt meter on most cars. This gives a rudimentary display of charge.\n\n2) cost/money etc. The auto industry is a bit hostile to these kinds of things. It would cost money in engineering to implement a reliable charge meter. It would also decrease the maintenance revenue that manufacturers could capture. It's the same reason why your car has a check engine light rather than giving you a specific readout of what's wrong. Instead you have to go to a dealership and have them diagnose (and fix) the issues.",

You might fry some electronics. Chat GPT says this:\n\nEven though electric vehicles (EVs) have large high-voltage (HV) battery packs (typically 300-800V) for propulsion, they still require a standard 12V battery for several key reasons:\n\n# 1. Powering Essential Low-Voltage Systems\n\n* Many vehicle components, such as lights, infotainment systems, power windows, locks, and sensors, still operate on 12V.\n* Using a dedicated 12V system prevents the need for high-voltage wiring in every minor component, reducing complexity and safety risks.\n\n# 2. Booting Up the EV\u2019s Main Computer System\n\n* The EV\u2019s power electronics, battery management system (BMS), and control units rely on the 12V battery to initialize before the main high-voltage system is engaged.\n* Without a functioning 12V battery, the car\u2019s main computer won\u2019t start, even if the high-voltage battery is fully charged.\n\n# 3. Safety and Isolation from High Voltage\n\n* The high-voltage system is typically disconnected when the vehicle is off to prevent hazards.\n* The 12V battery ensures that emergency systems, like airbags, hazard lights, and door locks, function independently of the HV system in case of a crash or system failure.\n\n# 4. Legacy and Compatibility\n\n* The 12V system is an automotive standard, allowing manufacturers to use existing off-the-shelf components rather than designing entirely new ones.\n* It also makes servicing and jump-starting easier, as a drained 12V battery can often be revived using traditional methods.\n\n# 5. Redundancy and Backup\n\n* If the high-voltage system fails, the 12V battery ensures that critical functions like brake assist and steering remain operational for safety.\n\n# What Happens if the 12V Battery Dies?\n\n* Just like in gas-powered cars, a dead 12V battery in an EV means the vehicle won\u2019t start or function properly.\n* Many EVs allow jump-starting the 12V battery from an external source or even from the high-voltage battery via a DC-DC converter.",

You can turn the car on (so lights, radio, etc work) without turning the engine on, usually by turning the key to the accessory or run position but not so far as to the ignition position. There may be exceptions, but I've never encountered one. I have, however, encountered quite a few people who didn't realize you can turn the key to accessory or run without turning it all the way to ignition to use the radio or lights without the engine running. I'd be curious to know your make/model to see if it is an actual exception.",
