Now, they're going to add me to some potting soil and the turns turning me into a bonsai tree. It's small enough to transport relatively easily, and if they accidentally kill me, they can just compost me and try again.\n\nThere are also places that can turn human remains into precious gems that can be mounted in a piece of jewelry or whatever, but none of us felt like that was right for us.",
