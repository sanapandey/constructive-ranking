Seems to just be a easy way for bot accounts to message you because it's an option, not typed, then once you reply they know they've got a live one\n\nEdit to add: I saw [this video ](https://youtu.be/pqUtJJHeUrY?si=Wzic-lqLLA_JGNcP) a while ago about Facebook marketplace in real life, it cracked me up!",

Like, I can see in the picture that the baseplate is falling off and the heel hinge is frankensteined from another pedal, so if you're going to lie to me then I'm just going to dip.\n\nHad another time where I agreed to pick up, but the guy wouldn't give me his phone number, just his address, so I show up when we agreed, ring the bell, no answer. Wait ten minutes, try again, no answer. Wait another ten, try again, no answer. So I leave. Later he tells me he was across the street fixing his car.\n\nLike wtf why would you not be at the place you asked me to meet at the time you asked me to be there, especially if you're going to refuse to give me contact info.
