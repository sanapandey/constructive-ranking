When you're in shape, life is better because it is easier daily. Lifting your groweries. Getting up from a couch or a chair. Carrying a big bow over your shoulders, or period. Being able to walk fast when you're late. Being able to follow your friends and family when walking or doing sports activities. Your thighs not hurting from driving manual. Your body feeling way less pains because your overall posture in any position is way better maintained thanks to your overall muscles. Having SO MUCH MORE energy, because all those daily movements aren't tiring you and at the contrary feel refreshing.\n\nYou run the marathon TO be able to do those things. So that life and daily movements and needs are easy enough, or even just feasibile. \n\n\nTHOSE are what make life wayyyyyy better when you're fit.
