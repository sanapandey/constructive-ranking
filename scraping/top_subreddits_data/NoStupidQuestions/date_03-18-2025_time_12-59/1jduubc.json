It does exist, being \"not conventionally attractive\" is a thing, and it varies across time and cultures, but it \\*is\\* a thing. \n\nThose comedians will outright declare that they are not conventionally attractive and they are fine with that, and don't want people to say \"aw, but you're beautiful!\"\n\nGuess what a lot of the commenters do?",

Nobody can make that better happen but you. But you absolutely owe it to yourself to start working towards it. Cut the dead weight from your life and find some peace \u2764\ufe0f\n\nOriginal comment:\n\nWell I know it\u2019s tough, but try not to let your husband\u2019s less enlightened view of beauty bring down your understanding of it. You\u2019re right, it\u2019s 100% okay to age. In fact people being too set on fighting aging is how you end up with these clown/balloon looking people full of Botox and what not. Not that I have something against people using Botox in general, but obviously some people go so far overboard with it that you can tell their mental health and self-worth is not in a good spot. Not trying to judge them, it\u2019s just kind of sad to see. Anyways, my point is that the resistance to natural aging can reach an almost pathological level, kinda like eating disorders or body dysmorphia. Obsession with youth can be a societal illness. Much healthier to embrace your body as it ages and evolve your aesthetic sense of beauty along with it. Which is what you\u2019re trying to do, and I\u2019m guessing your husband is holding you back on that front to some degree. Hard to embrace your aging body when the person you\u2019re closest to refuses to. So for both of your sakes, I hope he has a change of heart and learns to embrace the inevitable. It\u2019s coming whether he likes it or not lol. No one stays young forever. Doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t eat well and exercise and stay healthy as long as possible, but \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cyoung looking\u201d are not one and the same. So just try to be healthy. If for no one else\u2019s sake but your own. Life\u2019s a lot easier in a body not hindered by ill health.",

People struggle with this so much. \n\nThey cannot understand that \"beautiful\" isn't some objective measure.*  And they can't conceive that beauty isn't just the static parts of their visible body.\n\nThey're convinced it's all just some \"feel good\" participation trophy message. But it's quite literally not. We know that people find others more attractive the more they see them, the more they get to know them. We know that people feel attraction based on behavior. We also know that when people with a greater diversity of looks are shown in a positive light, it actually influences people to see those more diverse bodies and faces and so forth as attractive.\n\nWhile a seemingly silly study, it's my favorite to use as an example of how even an individual's tastes aren't static. In a study, they had men rate the attractiveness of different body sizes of women before the men ate lunch or after lunch. The men who hadn't yet eaten lunch rated slightly larger body sizes as more attractive than those who had just eaten lunch. Basically, experiencing hunger had a small but interesting influence on perceptions of attractiveness. \n\nBeauty isn't just a collection of features. Beauty is not objective. Beauty really is in the eye of the beholder and even the beholder's perceptions can change.\n\n\n*Yes, evolutionary psychology and evolutionary biology point to some physical features that are indicators of health as being universally attractive. But even those fields will tell you that in humans, outside of a handful of features, a lot of aspects of beauty and attractiveness are cultural and even individual. I know, I studied evo psych for years and got my PhD in social/evolutionary psychology focusing on  mating strategies and relationshio maintenance.",

Attraction has nothing to do with conventionally beautiful or not beautiful. Many men can admit their girlfriend or spouses are not lookers. Doesn't mean they aren't deeply attracted to their personality or other elements. \n\nThe whole point of the original post is saying we probably shouldn't be giving fake complimentsfor the sake of moral superiority. Calling someone who is morbidly obese with beady eyes, crooked nose, bald spots, pimples with puss all over, buck crooked black and yellow teeth, and an odor you can see beautiful is not it. \nThat person can be the kindest most gracious human. But they are not beautiful. \n\nWasting so much time typing on reddit is such a waste of time. I'd rather go back to what I originally said and got down votes for: stop the cap.",

All of those people find those conventionally negative things as attractive. They think they are beautiful, sexy, hot, or whatever word you wana use. Just because the majority of people don't consider them attractive, doesn't mean everyone doesn't. Hell, I've personally met people with multiple of those descriptors, who were still sexy AF to me. I'm unrealistically attracted to ugly redneck looking redheads preferably with unkept hair and buck teeth... They aren't conventionally attractive, I still think they are fucking gorgeous! Why?
