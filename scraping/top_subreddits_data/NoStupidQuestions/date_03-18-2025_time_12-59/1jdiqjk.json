Humans are complicated, and so is life, so there are tons of factors and not enough studies to solidify anything as a definitive fact. \n\nAll I can say is I\u2019m pretty active in the kink community and in the case of fetishes I would say about 70% had some sort of \u201cexposure event\u201d that they can remember from even a very young age. Sometimes it\u2019s positive incidents, neutral, or even traumatic events. Sometimes it\u2019s not one specific event but rather a culmination of things involving their upbringing. For lack of a better term, \u201cdaddy\u201d or \u201cmommy\u201d issues. Again, this is all anecdotal, this is all just information I\u2019ve gathered over my many years of study and interest. There are other articles I can link you, but I don\u2019t have an institution to get access to them anymore. \n\n[\u201cArising in a singular event fixing together otherwise heterogenous elements, the identity and power of the fetish consists in its enduring capacity to repeat this singular process of fixation, along with the resultant effect\u201d](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/RESv13n1ms20166762)\n\n\u201c[Generally speaking, a typical case may be somebody happens upon an object by accident or through exposure to leather, or dolls, or part of a human that\u2019s nonsexual, such as a foot or toe, and finds it pleasurable, so they continue using it in a sexual way,](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/what-causes-sexual-fetishes#Preference-and-personality)\u201d\n\n\u201cIf an object was pleasant or salient to early sexual experience we may associate that object with sex, and the use of it continues on with sexual behavior\u201d (Same article)",

Also I dont really have a fetish unless light bdsm would count, so I can't really confirm or deny this myself, but I feel like this could just be a case of \"correlation does not equal causation\", isn't it possible that people are just born with their fetishes and many people have an experience when they're young when they are exposed to their fetish, and it doesn't create the fetish, it was just already there and the memory sticks because \"discovering\" your fetish is a very emotional moment? Why does that early life event have to be the cause of the fetish, couldn't it just have been a result of it? Just that it's the first time.",

A dominant and/or submissive personality, and a brain that\u2019s wired for wanting more dopamine/serotonin release (which BDSM scenarios can provide). So maybe you have a brain that\u2019s ready to go, and then some sort of ignition event sets it off?\n\nAgain, anecdotal, but I know (much to my chagrin) that my parents were kinky. I think I inherited the Dom/submissive/kinky trait and then there was an event that happened when I was young involving an object that my brain latched onto. I don\u2019t think it already had an affinity preprogrammed for that specific object, and I hope to god my parents didn\u2019t have an affinity for that object, I just think I may have been hardwired for the *possibility* of something to come in and cause that reaction. If that makes sense?\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like how you can have genetic predispositions for other things like intelligence, homosexuality, alcoholism, cancer, etc. but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019ll manifest because environmental factors are at play too. You just may be more likely to exhibit that trait than someone that doesn\u2019t have those genetic precursors. Biology and the human condition is wild, man.",

It was a practice that used to be done in China, where they would break and bind the feet of a young girl so that they would be still be small when they grew up and fit into these special shoes. This was seen as a mark of superior feminine beauty, as it was primarily a symbol of status. A woman with bound feet had limited mobility, which means they were wealthy enough not to have work on their feet. \n\nWhile this example is one end of the extreme, we can carry over a similar logic. Well kept feet are a symbol of status. It means you both have the means to take care of them and a lifestyle that does not treat them harshly, which some folks find attractive. We can look to similar things like straight white teeth or expensive clothing, which are also status symbols and things that people are attracted to.",

As I got older I always admired feet from afar never doing anything until I learned in middle school that I was sexually attracted to them and that it was a thing. In high school it got out and was definitely rough sometimes with high school kids being absolutely ruthless. Over time the fetish has evolved, only in the last few years (32 now) I have been into the stinky side with domination. The aesthetic is still there as I just view them as beautiful in general..\n \nAs a weird side note I'm pretty sure it's hereditary as I wasn't the best at deleting my search history on my computer and I don't remember how it got brought up, but one time my dad and I were talking and he said \"Yeah you like feet, where do you think you got it from?\" Jaw.

I tried not to look, and pretended not to notice so my friends won't ask me anything.\n\nAfter getting home, i was aroused the whole day, and   found a way to release all the tension...\n\nSomething clicked in me that day, and I've been living with a foot fetish for 20 years now.",

Some neuroscientists think there can be a bit of cross-wiring between these areas, which could explain why some people develop a foot fetish. \n\nOf course, there are also psychological and cultural factors at play, but the brain-wiring theory is one of the more well-known scientific explanations.\n\nThere\u2019s also a psychological aspect to it\u2014fetishes, in general, can sometimes be linked to early experiences, including trauma or abuse. \n\nFor some people, especially those who experienced childhood abuse, the brain may redirect sexual associations to something non-genital, like feet, as a way of coping or creating a sense of safety.\n\nObviously, this isn\u2019t always the case, and it\u2019s probably a combination of a number of factors.

All throughout history, in times of rampant STD epidemics, there is a rise in foot fetishism. If you ask Sigmund Freud heda said its something about how as kids we see our moms genital region and noticed she lacked a penis, which shocked us and caused a fixated on anything phallus shaped, which apparently feet are... However, he was a kook.\n\n There's supposedly an actual biological reason for it, the brain!: the part of the brain that processes the sensation people get from feet is next to the area that perceives genital stimulation. It's something about wires getting crossed in our brain. At least for some people.\n\nThere is probably a plethora of ways the fetish takes hold. Fetishes usually pop up in our youth, and there are many of them. As a whole foot fetishes are like the most banal and common of them all.  Think about it, breast's are just as useless for procreation as feet are, and butts are literally the human sewage exit, yet it's cool to like those. Im not a huge foot guy, but my ex was into me sucking her toes as foreplay, which i had no clue women could be into that, sounds too ticklish, but who am I to judge. \n\n\n(This is just a tangent and could be considered TL:DR)\n I find it sad that it's got such a stigma attached to it. There was this guy in A school (school right after bootcamp to teach your job in the navy), and this dude got caught with a foot magazine, and he got ripped on pretty hard. I mean, I get it, easy target, but still. Everyone's got a fetish, and there's a lot worse ones out there. I shared my barracks room with this submarine guy who was going overseas in a month or two to Iraq, so I lent him one of my laptops. I knew he'd be looking at pron with it, I didn't mind, but one day I took it back for a bit and noticed he had a dozen, I dont even know if I can say it, umm \"dog videos\" downloaded limewire (a torrent site for the kids out there, torrents was how you pirated media before streaming sites, like kazaa or napster). I was disgusted. At least it was human women, so it didn't seem like he wanted to abuse animals, but itself was still abused. He was this loke 6'5 \"yoked giant, too. I just put the laptop back and pretended I didn't know deep down he was a perverted freak, but it was an awkward couple of weeks. My point is feet are a harmless fetish compared to what's out there.",

Not only does every woman have different smooth curves, but those curves are constantly changing and expressing emotions.\n\nBoobs and butts are like one or two curves.  But feet are nearly as complex as faces in their lines.  So many curves, and constantly in motion.\n\nPlus there is an entire industry devoted to framing a woman's feet to create different looks.  Strappy heels are like a bikini.  There are many many YouTube channels that are just women trying on and walking around in heels.  (Off topic, but Shoes of Hollywood is phenomenal.)",
