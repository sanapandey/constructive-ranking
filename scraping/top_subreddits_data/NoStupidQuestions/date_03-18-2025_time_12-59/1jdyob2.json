At the time there was a focus on meat and protein-based low-carb diets, and bacon was a relatively low cost meat product because pork in general was cheap and bacon in particular was low-value because it was high in fat. It largely ended when bacon prices rose because pork became more of a luxury meat on par with beef.",
