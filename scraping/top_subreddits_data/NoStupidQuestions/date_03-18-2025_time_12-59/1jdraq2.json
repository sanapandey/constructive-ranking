I low key believed for most of my life that I was a baby angel of death who was on an empathy-building exercise before graduation. Basically my PTSD gives me incredibly vivid nightmares of dying in various ways but with near-death experiences of someone who isn't me. Like once I was a gay man in India, once I was an older career man who regretted not having a family, once I was a Russian dissident--and in those few moments of the dream I see their entire lives flash before their eyes. I sometimes wake up not knowing which one is the dream and which one is real and spend my entire day dealing with that. I don't want to believe I'm suffering for no reason. I WANT to believe that it's all to give me experience so when I become an angel of death I can treat people with compassion and dignity. Thankfully medication is starting to control the nightmares. I'm on gabapentin now. It doesn't make me have fewer nightmares but it makes me forget them within a minute or two of waking up so at least it doesn't fuck up my entire day/week anymore. I'm just hoping that if my partner starts hallucinating before she dies I'll be there to comfort her in her final moments and I think that if I keep telling her I will be maybe she'll actually hallucinate it happening.",

You have no idea what infinities exist in the minds of other species, and to claim supremacy is just very shortsighted.",

Having no fucking clue how much time passed, exactly when you fell asleep or what you were doing in that moment, anything? One minute you're looking at a wall, and the next minute you're looking at a different wall, with absolutely *no* transition? It was one of the worst things I've experienced.\n\nMaybe I'm just sensitive to amnesia because I have an exceptionally bad memory (like, actual brain damage levels) and so will often review or recite events immediately after the best I can to try and retain something. But I was so frightened that the moment I registered that my surroundings were different, I demanded to know exactly what had happened, where I was, how far was I from my original point, what time it was then and when I fell asleep, and when the nurse couldn't answer, I burst into tears. I was full-on sobbing. Yes, my emotions were partially because I was also hungry and thirsty and all the fun things, but it was the fear that I couldn't remember falling asleep or even waking up again. I felt violated somehow.",

I won't forget it, but I've been through much worse in a hospital. In a way it was kind of comforting to me. I have had many surgeries. I always feel very vulnerable going into surgery and in the hospital. It was reassuring to know that they caught it and handled it so quickly.",

I'm purely guessing, but I believe it was close to the end of the procedure. What I remember is feeling a terrible pain \"in my leg.\" It wasn't my leg. It was an abdominal procedure.  I wear glasses or contacts. I have very poor eyesight. I remember the pain, then seeing a bunch of blue, realizing that the blue was the surgical team and a lot of shouting. Calm shouting, but definitely a lot of commotion. Someone said, \"DON'T MOVE.\" I told them my leg hurt and that I was going to move it. They told me not to move again and I was back out. I have a slow recovery from anesthesia. I'm not sure if that played a role or not. Everyone has off days. I don't know what happened. I know the surgery was successful, and the anesthesiologist and doctor checked on me during recovery, which is unusual. The surgeon sometimes checks in after you are out of the recovery room, but not usually while you are in the recovery room. It did me no harm, and the medical team was great. I spend enough time in clinics and hospitals to know that things that shouldn't happen, do happen. Often.",

Some sort of primal thing just takes hold of me, almost like an anxiety attack.\u00a0\n\n\nAnyway all this to say, no I never fight it, I want that part to be over as quickly as humanly possible. Usually the anesthesiologist agrees and knocks me out ASAP.\u00a0",

They knew what was happening so they didn't freak out or anything, but I kinda was. \n\nThe dental surgeon (who did not have good bedside manner) said \"look, if you don't go to sleep we're going to have to reschedule.\" So I reluctantly tried to relax. I woke up not knowing at all how long it had been. As I woke up I was seeing white/green titles fade away matrix-style, revealing the natural image of reality with a loud timey-whimy sound that was in my head. That only lasted about 10seconds. Despite that being very odd I was, to my pleasant surprise, not that high and loopy. I was just talkative and the person doing my paperwork said I shouldn't talk so much. I was so happy I wasn't painfully high that I was just sitting there in a bubbly mood looking around the room. The person doing the paperwork asked me a question and I smugly replied \"I thought you said I shouldn't talk? \ud83d\ude0f\" and I normalized within about 30mins to an hour.",

I apparently was hitting on him both times. \n\nAnother I had apparently been thanking everyone for their work and apologizing that I sucked as a patient. \n\nMy last one I was reading my book, they told me no book in the OR, then asked me what it was about. I started to tell them, woke up to them saying they would get my partner. I dozed off and woke up to my partner there. I felt hyper and was wanting to go for a walk, they apparently told him to not let me do that and we stopped at my work so I could grab something, which he ended up doing for me... and I fell asleep in the car. I slept the rest of the day (Friday) and woke up at about 4 am and played a video game. My sleep schedule was fine after the next day.",

I was wrapped like a damn burrito in like ten blankets. Wish I could've stayed like that\n\nAnother time I went under, I woke up with no memory of going to the clinic, getting prepped for surgery, OR the fact that I had surgery that day. As far as I was concerned, I blacked out and woke up in a random hospital bed surrounded by white curtains.\n\nI freaked out and started screaming. Five nurses ran in, four of them left to go get ??? Supplies? And the fifth one, a big dude, just sat down in the chair next to my hospital bed. \n\nI'm crying, struggling, trying to get out of this bed. Nobody is holding me down, but the anesthesia wasn't letting my body move right. Fifth nurse looks at me with a blank face and says \"I have rat traps in my basement\"\n\nI paused, tears on my cheeks, sniffling, \"You..\nWhat? Rat traps?\"\n\n\"Yeah. They're really big rats.\"\n\nAnd then two nurses returned to check my vitals to make sure I was okay, and then informed me that I had been there for surgery. Fifth nurse just stood up and left. \n\nI was discharged like twenty minutes later. What a trip.",

Women were told that they were getting a peaceful, pain free birth, but in reality, women were routinely strapped down to their beds because they became delirious. Twilight sleep did not actually cause a painless childbirth\u2014the scopolamine produced amnesia, so the woman did not remember the pain, but she got to enjoy the PTSD that came with it.",

This anecdote courtesy of said parent still not being fully under & recounting it to us post-op.\n\nI've basically given up that if there's ever a situation where I need pain/sedation, I'm just never going to get enough to touch it b/c docs don't want to \"overmedicate\" (or kill) their patients. So stuff just hurts & I'm just awake. Except propofol. Prop induction will get me down. \n\nBut so few seem comfortable keeping an infusion running since MJ, even though intubation & proper monitoring makes it 1000x safer than uhhh not doing those things at all.\n\nGood luck, gingy friends, paradoxical reactors & other beautiful mutants who resist certain meds like whoa. <3",

It turns out that I'm allergic to ibuprofen, and my migraine meds quit working within 2 years of starting them. Anesthesia drugs have been a nightmare; I woke up in the middle of surgery twice.The amnesia drugs don't really work very well either. I can remember almost everything from my surgeries and the time going into them, the operating room, and the recovery room. \n\nThe first C-section was really something else. After pushing for 40 hours, the doctor did an X-ray and found that my daughter was presenting face first, rather than crown first. Then her heart stopped. She needed to be delivered NOW. So they immediately took me in to surgery, and I had already had an epidural, so they tried to do a nerve block on me. They asked if I could move my legs, and I picked up my feet and asked where I was supposed to put them. The consternation on my doctor's face was priceless! They tried a second dose of medicine and started cutting. I screamed. Then they put a mask over my face and finished delivering my daughter while I took a little nap. \n\nThe anesthesia was working when I woke up. I couldn't move my legs at all!!",

I am not claiming that this does not happen - of course I am aware, and these rare cases are often reported widely in media. These days the incidence is less than 1 in 10,000, in paralysed patient, and even lower in unparalysed patients.\n\nWhat I am trying to negate, is the supposed worry of some people who imagine that general anaesthesia as a whole is this scary phenomenon where \"people are actually aware the entire time, but you are merely made to forget this experience\". THIS, is what I am trying to explain that does not really happen as a general rule (outside those rare, human-error cases). And as a rule, they DO remember in those rare tragic cases - that's precisely why they are traumatised and share it with the world.\n\nWe do NOT routinely give benzodiazepines (the amnesic you refer to), even though many practitioners do as a part of their synergistic mixture. Propofol and/or volatile anaesthetic agents alone have amnesic effects when given at appropriate doses + appropriate monitoring in place.\n\nSo no, you don't have to be disheartened about the possibility of my being an ignorant anaesthesiologist - we were simply talking about slightly different things.",

The same class of drugs are sometimes used as date rape drugs. Instead of those, which I won't name, we use benzodiazepines, such as midazolam, to knock you out. \n\nThe anesthetic gases shut down the cortex of the brain and most of the subcortical functions. If you are properly under anesthesia, your consciousness is shut off, and \"you\" simply don't exist during that time, so no memories are formed anyway.",

That may be one reason some people are certain they haven't had the surgery yet. They don't remember additional IVs, vital signs, or talking to the anesthesiologist at all. \n\nSource: Had to get a mirror and show a guy his appendectomy incision once, because he wanted to get up and go home since we weren't going to \"get on with it\" LOL. \n\nI love it when people who are really anxious about their surgery (myself included) wake up and don't remember a thing, and for them no time has passed. There was a real question if I'd be paralyzed in some area after my emergency anterior cervical fixation. When I woke up and they said my surgery was over, I apparently moved every single part of my body slowly and deliberately, then looked at the nurse and said \"Are you *sure,* because everything still works?\" She actually did a little happy boogie down  and said \"Honey, you are 100% *over* this!\"",

When it is extracted the forces placed on the jaw can, because of this large hollow, cause the bone to break. If the bone is too thin to support to the force necessary for extraction, for instance.\n\nBoth my dentist and my oral maxillofacial surgeon warned me it was a (small) possibility. But it's why they put you under, and they tell you if it happens, you'll wake up in pain, with your jaw secured in place (wired shut). And it's important that you not panic, because you can injure yourself. It's also in the informed consent paperwork you sign for that sort of extraction. But almost nobody actually reads those.\n\nIt doesn't happen too often, but it can, so they warn you. Generally speaking it's still better to get the extraction, in the long run, even if your jaw breaks and needs repair. Because if an impacted sideways wisdom tooth pushes forwards (and if sideways enough, can keep going) it can push your other teeth into each other and destroy your other molars. It's not fun.",

Like everyone else said, it goes so fast but is the deepest rest I've ever felt in my life. The confusion of suddenly being awake\n\nWith my impacted wisdom teeth, I was 18 and I woke up crying so bad they had to have my mom come back early and they were so mean about it. \n\nEmergency surgery due to a ruptured ectopic and internal bleeding is the only one I don't fully remember waking up from. But I do remember a nurse holding my hand in the OR before. I was in so much pain... he was such a rock for me. I was ready to be knocked out for that one. Did not care. Came to terms with the fact that I might die. \n\nWith my gallbladder, I remember coming out of it upset and hearing someone say \"go get her doctor so she recognizes someone.\" And the doctor came and stroked my hand and explained it went well. My response? \"You're so young!\" Lmao meanwhile the guy next to me is asking when he can eat. So chill.\n\nThen it happened again in 2023 for another abdominal surgery. I remember hearing the nurse bring my husband in and tell him something like \"she just started calming down.\" And I started groaning and crying again and he had a giggle. He said the noises were... interesting hahah.\n\nSo yeah, that's my norm. Any other criers here? \n\nAlso, redhead husband comes out \"combative,\" as it's been described lol.",

I feel like my mind gets conscious first, and I'm aware that I'm waking up from surgery so the first thing I do it just make sure I manually breathe. Not because it's difficult, but I just tell myself that it'll help wake me faster with deep breaths. When in this state it's really oddly peaceful. You have no stress, no anxiety, no responsibility. It was actually this experience that made me much less afraid of death. And then your senses start coming online. You realize you're hearing things. Then you try to open your eyes, and it lasts a second because you're still super sleepy, but fully conscious. At this point if someone's there with me I'll say something just to let them know I'm conscious, usually like \"is it over?\" And then I'll lie there and take deep breaths for a while before my eyes want to stay open. It feels like forever, but I bet in reality it's just a few minutes, but I actually have no idea.  \nAnd then everything's back to normal.\n\nI was super, existentially scared before the first time.

I wake up afterwards and feel groggy, no idea of the time but haven't forgotten where I am or the day or why I am there, it's just like waking up after a night sleep. I've always been woken up by external noise or someone running basic obs rather than coming round of my own accord.\n\n I have at times woken up of my own accord at home (obviously no anaesthetic involved) and not felt too bad but if I'm woken up by someone I'm groggy and feel wasted, in fact I regularly don't remember the day or even the month when I'm woken up by my alarm or external noise when I'm at home but don't seem to get this issue when I wake up after an anaesthetic in hospital. I'd say though I don't remember my dreams in the same way as not remembering the op I was under for, waking up from aesthetic is a far better experience than being woken up by my alarm or some other external trigger. \n\nGoing under is a weird situation! You are often asked a thinking question and can begin to answer but then very quickly lose the power in wanting to carry on talking, the feeling is of being very relaxed and tired. If you have ever been dog-tired and just wanting to close your eyes for a minute, it's very similar to that but comes with so much power you didn't see it coming. You stop talking because it just feels more comfortable to relax. You might try to continue with what you were trying to say but hear yourself slurring your speech and not really remembering exactly what comes next when voicing the answer to the question which is often something like \"count down from 5\" or \"can you run though the alphabet for me please\" it's not like you're asked really indepth questions here! I usually find it quite funny that I've lost capacity to talk normally and get a bit distracted by that but I could understand others maybe feeling frustrated or worried by themselves, you can ask to hold someone's hand if this is the case, but I normally do scare easy and though I don't know for sure I wouldn't be suprized if there is something in the anaesthetic that managed fear or anxiety enough to mean it's not an emotion you experience sensorially. \n\nThe only times I've been not quite under and alert enough to know what was going on was where I've been given a very short term aesthetic during something where being unconscious was less of a concern, it was just something I'd requested and been told would be possible (it wasn't, it didn't happen, and I was more alert during the op than I had wanted to be) example would be an endoscopy (camera through my throat and into my stomach), it wasn't terrifying and I know you don't need to be out of it for that particular investigation but I had asked to not be conscious and was told it would be happen. I'd had multiple endoscopies in the past, enough to learn I did not want to be awake during and to also know that it has in the past been very possible for my requests to be carried out. I was given the correct medication to do this, just not the correct amount, hence being semi conscious.",

As others describe, the anesthesiologist said something like here it comes and in a very few seconds I was out. Coming out in the recovery was just like waking up with no time passed. Most recently, it was a 4 hour procedure, the third try at replacing my tricuspid valve. It worked that time. I've about run out of procedures for them to do.

Usually a falafel gyro from a place by the hospital. I metabolize drugs really fast, i guess. \nI knew i was a little different when i was 18 and had my wisdom teeth out. When i woke up, i pulled my own IV out and started walking down the hall to the recovery room, i heard they had juice and recliners in there. They called my mom and sent me home instead. I was big mad about missing out on the free juice and recliners. Haha",

They told me they would give me a half-dose and see how I felt, instead of a full one.

I wasn't conscious during it but it also wasn't like I \"teleported\" or just temporarily nodded off and woke up. When I woke up it felt like a lot of time had passed, and I was really groggy and sore. The sore throat from the breathing tube maybe made it worse by making it feel like I was sick or waking up from a cold. \n\nI've had some experience with conscious sedation too. Once when I got an upper endoscopy in the ER, I don't think it was as effective as it could have been, I remember a lot, and it had me visualizing/dreaming/hallucinating bricks and pyramids. Twice for a colonoscopy and once for an angiogram which went much better - I remember most of them but it chilled me out enough that the procedure went ok.",

I had surgery in October, first time being under anesthesia. \n\nAs several other people have started, it's like dozing off for a second or two, and then realizing you've been asleep for 5 hours. \n\nWhen they administer the \"six pack in a syringe\" , as my anesthesiologist called it, you'll likely have a few minutes of feeling odd. A little bit loopy, but not severely so. Then the meds that prevent your memory from sticking to the tape will kick in, and you won't have memories from a certain point on, but your body will likely still be awake and able to take direction. \n\n(For example, in my case, I apparently was able to transfer myself, with assistance, from the pre-surgical bed to the operation table. I have ZERO memory of this. My last memory before being woken up after surgery, was looking at the clock above the door they were about to wheel me out of. Don't even remember leaving the room.) \n\nDepending on the procedure, they'll administer the anesthesia when they're ready to get the procedure started. \n\nWaking up was the weirdest feeling, and at least in my case, it's not like waking up from being asleep. I was the most drowsy I've ever been in my life, and had to be coaxed to open my eyes for like 10 minutes. It was very disorienting for me, but that could be due to the fact my surgery took 5 hours, and I hadn't eaten in almost 24 hours by the time I got out of surgery.",

I was in post op for HOURS because of the severe bleeding. Honestly, all I remember is closing my eyes on the surgical table and \"coming to\" at home in my bed. I was confused why I was in bed already but it was Apparently late into the night before I got home and settled in. It felt like only a brief second to me.\n\nAfter you're awake in the post op recovery is a different experience every time, but going to sleep and waking up is always super fast.",

I was awake for the dye injection though - \"woo hoo\" the tech went!\n\nThen there was the heart surgery. Robotic, but they stopped my heart for an hour and 45 minutes while they filleted it and repaired the mitral valve. \n\nHappy-go-lucky going in, big room full of big equipment, \"this will make you a little woozy\" - woke up 12 hours later in the ICU. It was dark outside. Probably the closest feeling to describe it would be jet-lag. My circadian rhythm was off for a few days.\n\nNo real \"hangover\" effect. \n\nThen I was knocked out for oral surgery, same thing - \"woozy\" - woke up 2 hours later feeling like I had been hit by a truck. The sedative was pretty crappy on the come-down. But that was 30 years ago.",

So from the perspective of your family around you, you're just asking the same few questions over and over again, and on a loop. From your perspective, you remember a few moments before the anesthesia, and then.. you're sort of on the other side, talking, interacting and not quite exactly sure how long you've been awake and you don't quite remember your first memory.
