They have to invest more than, say, gyms (who about 67% of their subscription-based membership never use), because unsubscribing from Netflix is just a few clicks of a mouse or taps on a phone. \n\n  \nSo they try to aim for new stuff every month and it's worked.",

Fincher has admitted that each episode took immense amount of effort to produce both from an expense standpoint but also creative.\n\nAllegedly, five seasons were mapped out but cost and surprisingly low viewership (relative to cost to produce) were the real deciding factors. Netflix didn't want to pay that much to sustain the high caliber production and Fincher didn't want to concede on doing it more cheaply as it was so taxing to do.",

It was just set up for failure on a service like Netflix that has 50+ shows and movies releasing a year.

What percentage click don\u2019t like?\n\nThey also track all sorts of online data. How many people are talking about the show on social media? How many people are searching it? How many blogs, etc are talking about it? What are people writing?\n\nThere are of course considerations of cost. Shows like Sense8 were filming all over the world. Others are costly because they use a lot of CGI. They will keep making a show if the above indicators are good, but if they\u2019re bad or just so so, they\u2019ll move on. There\u2019s shows like Mindhunter where all the data is good, the press is good, and they cancel because they just can\u2019t get actor/director production schedules to align; when a show is popular they want to strike while the iron is hot but if it takes three years to make a season (ahem, Stranger Things), they\u2019ll release the actors from their contracts. \n\nThey give these reasons often when a show gets cancelled. The fact of the matter is, a lot of shows are well-liked but only a small number of people are watching them and they\u2019re not sharing their interest/love enough online.",

While the payments are relatively modest after Season 1 and a little bigger after Season 2, I hear they escalate after Season 3, especially for series owned by Netflix \u2014 sometimes from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars \u2014 as the studio starts to pay off the shows\u2019 back-end. For series from outside studios, which I hear cost about 20% more than their Netflix-produced counterparts, I hear the built-in payment increases do not skyrocket as much but still are bigger after Season 3, Season 4 and beyond.\n\nThere's also something about actors' contracts having (automatically?) significantly higher rates after season 2 for why cost increase a lot.

For example, if their data shows a lot of people tuned into episode one (and now the show is a \"hit\" and there is buzz\") but most of those people don't actually watch all the episodes of that season, Netflix will cancel the show.\n\nIf most people watch all the episodes, they renew it.  Or if enough people do.\n\nNetflix has data on every show you watch, how long you watch it, if you fast forward through parts, if you rewind and re-watch parts of shows, if you re-watch shows, etc... they know exactly how you, specifically, are consuming their service.  I'm sure, mostly, they aren't looking at YOUR specific habits but I would be pretty sure they have all sorts of amalgamations of data to reveal what people watch on the platform.",

You were contracted for 22 episodes, so you knew that you'd have work for that time. Once all your filming/editing is done and you have 3 or 4 in the bank, the showrunners approach the network to see if they are renewing for another season. If so, Awesome. They'll probably have a break of a few months to get stuff sorted, but they've secured their jobs for the time being, plus all the sets are already built - Might need a bit of a set dressing update, but the room and 4th-wall facing couch is already there.  \nIn that scenario, the network can monitor the success of the show and base their decision on that.  \n\nNowadays, with streaming services - Theres no need to be vying for a timeslot on a channel. The streaming company can be all like 'Yeah, just get it all made before September, and we're golden'  \nSome DO get released weekly, but many don't anymore - they drop the whole season so it can be binged - I also read a comment where someone mentions that not everyone has the time to binge, especially if each episode is an hour or more, which is fair which could skew the watch stats, but I don't know about that.  \n\nThe issue with this is that by the time the editing gets done, subtitles translated and all that, a lot of the people involved (actors, VFX companies and film crew for example) have moved on to other projects, and getting them all back to film another season a year or so after the first one can sometimes be logistically impossible.\nYou'll notice this when shows have a much higher production value vs shows that were still being worked on a few weeks before release. This results in a show needing more money, which in turn reflects how much they'd need from the streaming service, which will then comes down to profitability.  \n\nAll that being said, I'm stoked for the next season of Wednesday, but disappointed that there will be no more Kaos. (Jeff Goldblum as Zeus? I mean... just that alone is gold, and throw in Killian Scotts incredible music... Daaamnn!)",

Plus they have to stop people from unsubscribing and joining other platforms, so they need something and compelling each month to keep on going. So they are trying to retain their current 300 million subscribers who are pumping at least $28 billion into the company every year. \n\nPlus, there is the old Hollywood accounting tricks. You can make profit on something with the project not actually making a profit.

Just for **Netflix**! I am sure they paid for other services too! So yes it looks like alot, but in the grand scheme of things this pc cost me $1200 - 10 years ago and I have spent around $700 on drives over the years. So $1900 in all - for total freedom from the greedy corporate fucks that slurp our data, enshittify their services and raise our prices in return.\n\nNow I pay $5/month for a usenet acct and maybe $6/month on electricity and have been doing that for almost 5 years now, it is a much better deal IMO",

            "body": "I worked for a FAANG streamer a couple years ago (have extensive experience with all the major industry providers, content creators, platforms, etc). The reason you spend money making original content (as opposed to license content, which Netflix does both) is to have unique enough content (content that you can\u2019t find anywhere else) so that keeps subscriptions from lapsing and ad inventory CPMs high. High engagement (MAU, HPC) means the customer perceives value and does not leave the service and advertisers having to make ad buys because they can\u2019t reach a Netflix MAU anywhere else.\n\nYour question now is the wrong perception, it\u2019s not how Netflix is going to get paid back for the cost of content (it generates revenue through subscriptions and ad revenue), it\u2019s how much content do they have to make, how much it costs, and the right portfolio to keep the existing subscriber metrics consistent, lapses down, and new subscriber count up. Original content also means that Netflix has some pricing power if they ever want to tweak pricing and/or play with ad frequency on their ad model.\n\nThis is the exact reason why just 10 years ago, Netflix was mostly licensed content, such as Disney, Marvel, The Office, etc and they pivoted to original content such as House of Cards, Stranger Things, etc. Netflix knew that eventually if they didn\u2019t start creating their own content, the business would collapse as licensing got quickly pulled in favor of new streamers such as Disney+, Peacock, etc.\n\nSeparately, you typically have a portfolio of content, there\u2019s your expensive high budget flagship movies and series and then there\u2019s your cheaper reality tv like content to round it out.\n\nFun fact: What I remember about Netflix is that they are the one of very few services that don\u2019t spend on any advertising for user acquisition, they are a behemoth and even without advertising, customers expect that they are only 1-2 clicks away from opening the app on any platform (FireTV, Roku, Chromecast, AppleTV, etc). The only other service I know with this much power is YouTube. YouTube is easily the most watched service in the entire world and Netflix is second.",

With Rebel Moon they are at least trying to establish their own space opera.\n\n\nThe weird disconnect is when they spend a lot of money to make movies that have very little scope to be particularly relevant or enduring even if they are well made. \"The Grey Man\", \"Red Notice\", \"Lift\"... for hundreds of millions of dollars, Netflix get two hours of fairly forgettable content in fairly crowded genres. Even if they succeed, where does it get Netflix? I won't be researching any of them 5 or 10 years didn't the line. I could well watch a sequel, but they will cost even more for Netflix! It's lose-lose.\n\n\nFar better to make more stuff that might be unicorns, like Squid Game or Stranger things, or continued support for very good shows that haven't captured the public yet (for instance Santa Clarita Diet, Happy, I'm Not Okay With This\"), and for films do more low-medium budget and keep big budgets for films that might attain some sort of legacy.\n\n\nHell, if the spent that 320 million dollars on a first season for three shows, even if the shows weren't great Netflix would have denied their competitors 30 hours of screen time, rather than 2 or 3.",

The person above explained how Netflix model works and not much of it relies on cultural impact. It surely doesn't hurt, but still. The movies you listed - Gray Man, Red Notice and so on - are among the most watched Netflix movies of all time. The genre might be crowded, but those project rose above the crowd.

It\u2019s not just about getting that many new subscribers, it\u2019s also about fulfilling their duty and keeping their current subscribers happy and satisfied so they stay subscribed. Big blockbuster-esque movies like The Electric State with big name actors and broad appeal do just that. Doesn\u2019t matter if critics or Redditors think it\u2019s a good film, it just needs to entertain the average Netflix subscriber enough to make them feel good about paying X dollars per month for the service. For that they need a consistent drip feed of new content. And occasionally they need some big splurges like this. Netflix is the dominant streaming platform for a reason.

That gives them $2.4 billion USD/month at a very, very conservative guesstimate.  They can certainly afford to blow a few million on a new movie.\n\n> Surely they can't expect to bring in 32,000,000 new account signups to recoup the cost? What's going on here?\n\nIt's not about luring-in new subscribers, it's about keeping the old ones.  You need a hefty catalog to keep people around.  With a few exceptions, folks aren't routinely re-watching the same show over and over and over again.  Most shows/movies are a one-time watch.  So then you need something new to watch.  If you ever start running out of new stuff to watch on Netflix you start eying their competitors.  Maybe Hulu or Max has something you want to watch.  Maybe you cancel Netflix and switch over to one of them.",

You're thinking of this like an individual product rather then part of a larger service.\n\nMovies need to make back their own cost of production hence being released in theaters then on home video to double up on income. They are an individual product that while it might have crossover with parts of a franchise is a financial success or failure purely on it's own performance. \n\nNetflix however is a service so they don't need to bring in millions of new accounts with a film like this to make money. Instead they need hype that keeps the current audience interested so they don't cancel their service, if that happens the movie pays for itself and then some in a mere two months. Netflix already has around three hundred million subscribers paying $10 a month to have access to their library so two months of continued subscriptions paid from all those viewers. \n\nThe point is not to make enough money on it's own to be worth it but to keep enough attention that the library of content makes money.",

Chris Pratt probably is paid less for being in Jurassic World or Guardians of the Galaxy but probably makes a chunk of money from box office. Can\u2019t do that with Netflix so actors get paid more to make up for that and thus Netflix movies had giant budgets that seem out of whack with a typical Hollywood box office movie.",
