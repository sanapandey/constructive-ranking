This I think got cut, when I tried a few weeks ago to access that site it was no longer available.\n\nThere is another option they offer, [Free Fillable Forms](https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/free-file-fillable-forms). It's not as fancy and automated, you go through the instructions and fill out the forms and must add other forms (W-2, schedules, etc.) as needed, but it can do the calculations for you and provide you a PDF you can file I believe electronically as well as printed for snail mail (the latter probably not a great idea given these ridiculous times in IRS and elsewhere in government today).",

I had a complex situation involving buying out a life estate (my late father picked this awful estate tool for his second wife), selling the family home, and then claiming capital gains.

Three people told me I was stuck. Then I found another person and I started crying in frustration. \n\nI got a refund for Turbo Tax. And I use a tax prep person now.",

I don't think that's complacency, just sensible.\n\nOne new thing I saw this year, it can actually scan your W2.  Just take a photo of your W2, or scan it with a scanner, and give TurboTax the image/PDF, and it will import all your stuff.  That's pretty slick if you ask me.",

Under the terms of an agreement with the federal government, Intuit and other commercial tax prep companies promised to provide free online filing to tens of millions of lower-income taxpayers. In exchange, the IRS pledged not to create a government-run system.\n\n> Since Free File\u2019s launch, Intuit has done everything it could to limit the program\u2019s reach while making sure the government stuck to its end of the deal. As ProPublica has reported, **Intuit added code to the Free File landing page of TurboTax that hid it from search engines like Google, making it harder for would-be users to find.**\n\n> Twelve years ago, **Intuit launched its own \u201cfree\u201d product: the similarly named \u201cFree Edition\u201d of TurboTax. But unlike the government program, this one comes with traps that can push customers lured with the promise of \u201cfree\u201d into paying, some more than $200.** Free Edition was a smash hit for Intuit and its pitch for \u201cfree\u201d prep remains core to the company\u2019s growth. Recently, it launched a \u201cfree, free free free\u201d ad campaign for the Free Edition, including a crossword puzzle in The New York Times in which the answer to every clue was \u201cf-r-e-e.\u201d\n\n\nEDIT: THIS CURRENTLY HAS -3, NO COMMENTS. What the fuck is wrong with pointing out the issues with Intuit, and the investigative reporting that PROVES they are scammy?",

I wouldn't say his situation is that complex but he said that when he tries the free file he generally owes more than when the accounting firm does it. So I think it comes down to what you owe and will a tax professional be able to reduce that. Honestly though for most people it's probably not worth it unless you know or think you have things that can reduce your tax burden. \n\nI'll also say that the signs that guarantee you a return are largely scams. Most of them aren't accountants and will put down anything to get you a refund. So the long and short is that tax preparation services are only truly worth what a professional can legally shave off your tax bill",

Even when it became ILLEGAL for them to not offer the service for free, because they had a contract with the IRS - they still hid the free service and made it incredibly difficult to access, even for those who qualified for it. \n\n\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/inside-turbotax-20-year-fight-to-stop-americans-from-filing-their-taxes-for-free\n\n\n> The centerpiece of Intuit\u2019s anti-encroachment strategy has been the Free File program, hatched 17 years ago in a moment of crisis for the company. Under the terms of an agreement with the federal government, **Intuit and other commercial tax prep companies promised to provide free online filing to tens of millions of lower-income taxpayers. In exchange, the IRS pledged not to create a government-run system.**\n\n> Since Free File\u2019s launch, Intuit has done everything it could to limit the program\u2019s reach while making sure the government stuck to its end of the deal. As ProPublica has reported, Intuit added code to the Free File landing page of TurboTax that hid it from search engines like Google, making it harder for would-be users to find.\n\n> Twelve years ago, **Intuit launched its own \u201cfree\u201d product: the similarly named \u201cFree Edition\u201d of TurboTax. But unlike the government program, this one comes with traps that can push customers lured with the promise of \u201cfree\u201d into paying, some more than $200.** Free Edition was a smash hit for Intuit and *its pitch for \u201cfree\u201d prep remains core to the company\u2019s growth.* \n\n\nedit; A planet money podcast about a guy who made a website for people to file taxes for free on, and how intuit went after him. \n\n> All of the crazy stress around taxes - the 24-hour hotlines, the software, the accordion folders full of receipts, the lines down the street at H&R Block - that is pretty much just a U.S. thing.\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/transcripts/521132960\n\n\nThe comments in this thread calling people who use a service like Intuit \"lazy\" are childish. They specifically designed the system to be confusing and arduous, and a time-suck, so they could line their pockets.",

But it's probably unnecessary.\n\nThe forms are all available free from your local Post Office or Library.  They're not that hard to fill out.  It's usually something like put this number from your W-2 into box A.  Put that number into box B.  Add A and B together.  Subtract C.  It's really pretty straight-forward.\n\nYou can also typically file online or use something like TurboTax for $20 - $50.\n\nThe $200 \"tax preparer\" you see camped-out at Walmart is probably not doing anything you couldn't do yourself.  They're probably not trained/educated much better than you are.  They've probably had some one-week crash-course on how to use a specific piece of software and that's about it.  They aren't going to be of much help if you've got a genuinely complicated/weird situation.  The folks using this service, generally speaking, are ill-informed of their options.",

I had to point it out to him, and he still had no idea what it was and had to look it up. \n\nSo yeah - paying someone to do your taxes can cost you a hell of a lot more than the $200.
