    "selftext": "I\u2019m curious about something and would really appreciate hearing from women on this.\n\nI recently had a conversation where someone mentioned that there are days when they just feel unattracted to their partner, even if nothing specific is wrong. They described feeling this way even about themselves sometimes, and they wondered if hormones could be a factor. This person also mentioned having irregular cycles, so I\u2019m curious if that could play a role too.\n\nI\u2019m asking because I want to better understand if this is a common experience. If it is, how do people typically navigate it? I imagine it can be confusing or frustrating for both sides, so any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated.",

Some mornings I wake up and I am so excited about them and they are so delicious and I love them! Some mornings I go to eat my eggs, prepared the same way, and I can barely even bring myself to put them in my mouth without gagging. Haha seems silly but it's just the way it is.
