But to be sure, she'll have a look anyway. I was seething at this point, but kept my mouth shut.\n\nTurns out, I wasn't imagining anything (I didn't get an apology though). They had actually cut the removal strings *too short*. Normally they leave some length and the strings sort of wrap themselves around the cervix. These didn't and there were basically two little metal prongs pointing outwards from her cervix.\n\nShe fixed it by cutting them off even shorter, which did lead to the removal being a bit more complicated than normal. But it was that or no more PiV sex for 4 years, which wasn't an option for my gf.",
