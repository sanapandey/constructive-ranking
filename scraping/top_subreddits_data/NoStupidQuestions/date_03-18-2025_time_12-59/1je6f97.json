If I stop at the local liquor store and buy my favorite whiskey the clerk doesn't ask because I am obviously older than 21.  The difference is company policy not the state law.  I know this, so if I go into Walgreens I will be asked for ID because the company requires it so I provide it, the clerk has no choice.  Most of the liquor stores where I live are small family owned and not corporate, so they are only bound by state law which required ID if the person appears to be under 21.  This will differ depending on what state you are in.  Historical note:  Walgreens got their start by selling medicinal alcohol during prohibition.",

                            "body": "Likely it isn't actually by vendor but by some other category, and certain vendors were assigned to particular categories by default. Long time ago I used to work for a grocery/drug store chain. Their system was ancient even then, I believe it supported 100 categories (0-99). Only four were used in the liquor department. One for wine, one for beer, and one for hard liquor and one for everything else. Everything that came from a liquor vendor was put in one of those categories regardless of alcohol content (even stuff like promotional Styrofoam beer coolers, or beach umbrellas that weren't consumables.)   \n\n\nEven with the limited categories though, it was more a matter of policy than system limitations. We did have housewares categories that the coolers/umbrellas could have been entered under, and the system did support setting age requirements per-item, but from a legal standpoint it was far better to err on the side of caution. There were no legal consequences for requesting an ID when one wasn't needed and no legal consequences for denying a sale that technically shouldn't require an ID, but you (the individual cashier, and the store overall) could lose your liquor license for missing one that did. Much better to have a straight forward policy that did not leave room for misinterpretation.",
