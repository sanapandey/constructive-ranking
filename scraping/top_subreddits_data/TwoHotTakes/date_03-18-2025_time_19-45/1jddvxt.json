    "selftext": "\nI have a 10 month old boy, my SIL has a 9 month old boy. My SIL called yesterday and asked if her, her boyfriend(not her son\u2019s dad), her baby, and the baby she was babysitting (Baby Z)could come stop by the house just for a minute. I said oh sure we\u2019d love some cousin time! I made some baby friendly snacks for the kids and then they showed up soon after. \n\nNow when they came in she sat her son, and baby Z in their car seats still. Now within 2 minutes she pulled her son out of his car seat. She left baby Z in his car seat. She had this baby sitting in his car seat for 40 minutes before I said hey guys this baby smells like he has a dirty diaper and he\u2019s getting fussy. I was already pissed they were leaving this baby in his car seat and not letting him out to play with the other babies. \n\nFor the next 20 minutes her and her boyfriend argued back and forth saying \u201cI\u2019m not changing this baby, you do it\u201d. Just bickering about who\u2019s gonna change this little baby\u2019s diaper that they were both getting paid to watch!!! I was livid and so glad I\u2019ve never let them keep my son before and knew they would neverrrr watch my son just from watching this interaction. I ended up pulling this boy from his car seat and changing his diaper and getting him a new outfit. Baby Z had blood blisters on his butt and I had to put him In the bath to get the cakes up poop off because I didn\u2019t want to scrub it with wipes since I knew it had to be so sore. I knew the babies mother but haven\u2019t really had any conversations with her.  Just knew her from around town. \n\nI stepped outside and called her on Facebook to tell her the situation. I said I would keep him here with me if she felt more comfortable with it since SIL and her boyfriend were straight up neglecting this baby. His mom thanked me and said she\u2019d really appreciate it and she would come to my house to pick him up and pay me what they were supposed to pay SIL. I walked back in and they were getting ready to leave. \n\nI told SIL I had just talked with the babies mom and she\u2019d feel better if he was left with me and my son. I told her go ahead and call her to double check but her and her boyfriend were not leaving with the baby. SIL has trashed me to every family member she can think of. She\u2019s made a Facebook post about how I thrive off drama and creating rumors about her. I\u2019ve had my husbands other sister ride by my house yelling slurs and throwing eggs at my house last night. I\u2019ve never ever been in a situation like this before where I was just witnessing straight up neglecting of a child. I feel I should have acted sooner and it\u2019s making my stomach turn. I hate hate drama but our small town really thrives off of it. I\u2019m not sure if I should just ignore these people? Or if I should stand up and tell people what really happened and out SIL to the town. \n\nEdit to add: the babies mother IS making a post today to out SIL- with receipts of the incident. I\u2019m waiting for that and hoping coming from the babies mother it would actually be heard and believed. ",

They're so uncaring of a babies suffering that It's either that baby dies, hers does, or they're shamed into something more approximating parents. Either way, every parent in the area deserve to know what they're like due to the sheer danger the represent.

As bad as it is having people harassing you, just know that you absolutely did the right thing. \n\nI think you need to reach out and let them know if the harassment doesn\u2019t stop, you\u2019ll publicly announce (with receipts!) what they did to a poor little baby to the whole town. Then if they don\u2019t stop, actually do it. Block them on all social media and go NC. If they don\u2019t stop harassing you, get some cheap outdoor cameras and record what they\u2019re doing and take it to the police.\n\nI know you hate drama, but this conflict may not go away with a head in the sand approach. You did the right thing, keep that same energy and now advocate for yourself.",

She had to use special soaps and laundry detergents because if you even so much as wiped my skin off with a dry cloth that had been washed in regular detergent, I would break out in the most horrible red rash. There's a picture of me from a family holiday gathering where my lower face is broken out and painful looking because my asshole aunt (a school nurse in her younger years, and arrogant as fuck about it) just had to prove my mother wrong and deliberately wiped my face with a random rag before my mother could stop her. My skin has no such sensitivities now as an adult.\n\nOur bodies' waste can be very damaging if it stays on our skin, even as adults, and some babies just have extremely sensitive skin when they're little. Their skin reacting quickly to sitting in a soiled diaper doesn't automatically mean neglect is the cause. I would recommend moms err on the side of caution and check with their pediatrician to make sure there is no underlying issue or to get advice on how they're handling things, just in case, but there is no reason to throw around accusations of neglect like that.",

            "body": "Backup of the post's body: \nI have a 10 month old boy, my SIL has a 9 month old boy. My SIL called yesterday and asked if her, her boyfriend(not her son\u2019s dad), her baby, and the baby she was babysitting (Baby Z)could come stop by the house just for a minute. I said oh sure we\u2019d love some cousin time! I made some baby friendly snacks for the kids and then they showed up soon after. \n\nNow when they came in she sat her son, and baby Z in their car seats still. Now within 2 minutes she pulled her son out of his car seat. She left baby Z in his car seat. She had this baby sitting in his car seat for 40 minutes before I said hey guys this baby smells like he has a dirty diaper and he\u2019s getting fussy. I was already pissed they were leaving this baby in his car seat and not letting him out to play with the other babies. \n\nFor the next 20 minutes her and her boyfriend argued back and forth saying \u201cI\u2019m not changing this baby, you do it\u201d. Just bickering about who\u2019s gonna change this little baby\u2019s diaper that they were both getting paid to watch!!! I was livid and so glad I\u2019ve never let them keep my son before and knew they would neverrrr watch my son just from watching this interaction. I ended up pulling this boy from his car seat and changing his diaper and getting him a new outfit. Baby Z had blood blisters on his butt and I had to put him In the bath to get the cakes up poop off because I didn\u2019t want to scrub it with wipes since I knew it had to be so sore. I knew the babies mother but haven\u2019t really had any conversations with her.  Just knew her from around town. \n\nI stepped outside and called her on Facebook to tell her the situation. I said I would keep him here with me if she felt more comfortable with it since SIL and her boyfriend were straight up neglecting this baby. His mom thanked me and said she\u2019d really appreciate it and she would come to my house to pick him up and pay me what they were supposed to pay SIL. I walked back in and they were getting ready to leave. \n\nI told SIL I had just talked with the babies mom and she\u2019d feel better if he was left with me and my son. I told her go ahead and call her to double check but her and her boyfriend were not leaving with the baby. SIL has trashed me to every family member she can think of. She\u2019s made a Facebook post about how I thrive off drama and creating rumors about her. I\u2019ve had my husbands other sister ride by my house yelling slurs and throwing eggs at my house last night. I\u2019ve never ever been in a situation like this before where I was just witnessing straight up neglecting of a child. I feel I should have acted sooner and it\u2019s making my stomach turn. I hate hate drama but our small town really thrives off of it. I\u2019m not sure if I should just ignore these people? Or if I should stand up and tell people what really happened and out SIL to the town. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Make a point of calling it child abuse, because that\u2019s what neglect is. If they try to brush it off as \u201cjust\u201d diaper rash, point out that blood blisters aren\u2019t part of normal diaper rash. Nor should the poop have had the time to dry and cake. Be explicit.\n\nYour husband should absolutely be a part of the conversation not only to back you up, but also to hear what both sides say.

I have worked in childcare for many years, I'm a mandatory reporter and if I would've witnessed that I would have been obligated to report it to CPS as well. I'm certainly not telling you that I think you should do that but if it had been me I would not have had a choice. I know that family members probably don't see it this way but that kind of behavior is abusive. In a childcare setting it is illegal to keep a baby in a car seat once inside, to keep them strapped into a swing to keep them in a bouncy seat for more than five minutes. So op *you keep doing YOU*",

Your SIL can't be allowed to provide childcare for any other children. That child's parent(s) will really be remiss if she/they doesn't go to the proper authorities. \n\nI get that there is a good chance that your SIL is probably an unlicensed daycare provider and working under the table for cash but, she still needs to be held accountable for what she did to that child. That kind of abuse does impact an infant.\n\nI'm truly sorry that this happened to you but I'm really happy that you rescued this poor little baby!

You should be proud of yourself for being brave enough to not only let the baby\u2019s mother know but step in as a shield for that child. \n\nSecondly-any and all abuse you receive from the family, keep receipts. Keep proof of texts, video of any time anyone comes and messes with your house, etc. Don\u2019t accept any phone calls, allow them to go to voicemail for the time being-if they\u2019re ballsy enough to drive by your house to harass you they\u2019ll be ballsy enough to scream into the void on a voicemail that you can use as proof. If it continues file a police report for harassment. \n\nThirdly-FUCK your SIL and any family that\u2019s backing her up. I hope your husband continues to stand by your side and truly feels the gravity that this situation is-your SIL and any family members that fully back her while she was avidly abusing and neglecting a child are disgusting individuals who should never ever have unsupervised access to your children, or even access at all. If she\u2019s doing that so blatantly to someone else\u2019s child, what happens to her child behind closed doors? I\u2019d be sitting in wait to make that CPS call. If you have so much disregard for a living breathing human life that has been entrusted to your care, what are you doing with the lives that are in your care that you created when no one\u2019s watching? That\u2019s all I can think about right now. \n\nStay strong, don\u2019t give into the bait. Let her blast you on socials and around town, the truth will come out sooner or later and she\u2019ll be the social pariah she\u2019s trying to make you out to be.
