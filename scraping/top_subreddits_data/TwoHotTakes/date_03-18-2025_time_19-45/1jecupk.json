    "selftext": "I (29) am part of a club that consists of several regular members and recently a new location that hosts our events opened much closer to home. Before now we had to travel 30-45 minutes for our meetings. One member who has been part of the club for a while longer than me (Alanna, 35ish) has recently been going on tirades about her personal feelings and opinions. In summary she is in pain about who our current president is and how he has affected a lot of things. She doesn\u2019t like it and she has been developing more and more extreme views in opposition. Most recently she stated she would only be associating herself with people who prove their \u201cpolitical allegiance\u201d aligns with hers. She said she will consider anyone a sympathizer of the \u201cTrump regime\u201d if they don\u2019t prove to her their open opposition. \n\nSomeone in our group has been organizing times for us to be using this new space for our club activities and made an announcement in our group chat. Alanna immediately went on a tirade about how she will not be participating in any of our events because she can\u2019t trust that their views align with hers because she doesn\u2019t know who owns the space and doesn\u2019t want to risk coming into contact with \u201csympathizers\u201d and only invites certain people to a space she considers to be neutral to have a mini club meeting to spend time together with people who \u201cunderstand her cause\u201d and she knows are fully against this \u201cregime.\u201d She said a good handful more but I won\u2019t add it. Everyone in the chat read it but didn\u2019t respond. The main main MAIN rule of our club is to leave politics out of it because we meet up 1-2 times a week to get away from the negative and crappy things in the world for 2-3 hours and for the most part it\u2019s upheld except from when Alanna wants to let out her grief. \n\nAnyway, like everyone else I ignored her tirade but someone sent a message within a couple minutes after she finished her tirade and I began responding to him. To make it worse, one of the guys she accuses of \u201cmaking her that way\u201d entered the chat and he and I began chatting. Was I TA for this? Should I have acknowledged her feelings despite having sat through a similar tirade twice during a meeting 2 weeks ago? I am working as one of the organizers in charge of setting up a new club meeting (and all it entails) at this new location (if that helps or is relevant). ",

In fact, she seems to be monopolizing the group chat, and meeting times to grandstand and performatively demonstrate her own beliefs and her demonization of all others who do not share her beliefs. \n\n  \nI can understand where she is coming from- I'm not at all happy about the state of the world these days and specifically what is going on here in this country, but I would not, and she shouldn't be hijacking the club activities to perform her rage, especially when you have rules about not discussing politics. \n\nif I were you, I'd ask her to keep it to herself during club activities because of the rule against it, and if she can't comply with that, she should probably be asked to leave the group.",

You're right to focus on the main rule of the club\u2014keeping things neutral and fun for everyone. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong by chatting with someone else after her outburst. It\u2019s important to keep the group vibe positive, especially since you\u2019re working on organizing things. You didn\u2019t ignore her feelings, you just didn\u2019t want to get pulled into the drama.",

But for example, knitting. We knot at a crafts store and have dedicated knitting days. The shop owner lets us use their space and we male up the rules for our specific knitting group but the shop owner could care less. If we told the shop owner he would say he isn\u2019t keeping her from coming. The one saving grace is that she deeply despises the shop owner because a supporter of the current president made a statement online that wasn\u2019t political in nature at all but because the shop owner saw it and said \u201cyeah that makes sense\u201d she took it as a personal attack and that\u2019s when the tirades began",
