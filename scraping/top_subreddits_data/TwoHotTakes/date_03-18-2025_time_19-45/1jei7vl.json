    "selftext": "\nI'm a 29-year-old woman who got married last month to my husband (30M). We dated for one and a half years before tying the knot. Honestly, there were some red flags during our dating period, but he promised to change, and I focused on the good parts, so I decided to go ahead with the marriage.\n\nNow, I'm out of a job and have been interviewing. I recently got an offer for a client-facing role, which would involve meeting with clients, attending conferences, and yes, professional dinners. My husband has expressed discomfort with this, especially the part about meeting with male clients. He is quite possessive and doesn\u2019t want me going to dinners with guys, even though it's strictly professional. This controlling behavior is exactly one of the red flags I thought he'd change.\n\nTo make things more complicated, his mother recently asked if I was pregnant in the middle of an unrelated conversation. When I told her we aren't planning on having children (something my husband and I agreed on), she seemed shocked and pressed on why we made that decision, expressing her desire to be a grandparent.\n\nI feel trapped and creeped out, just one month into our marriage. My husband's possessiveness over my career and his mom's invasive questions about our decision not to have kids are raising serious concerns for me. I thought these issues were addressed before we got married, but now I'm facing them head-on.\n\nI'm not sure how to handle this situation or how to communicate my concerns without causing a huge conflict. Is this normal? Any advice on how to deal with possessive behavior and overbearing in-laws would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks for listening.",

I laughed at him for being ridiculous. From someone whose job had him visiting women (and men) in their homes to sell them something it was pretty rich. I have no intention or desire to cheat and I'm not going to live as though I might accidently slip and land with another man's penis in my vagina. And in time, he accepted that this was something I was going to do. No argument needed because people are allowed to have friends. I had informed him within a month of meeting him that if he ever hit me, he would never see me again. Now, this was back in the olden days, but women get the idea that they need to.compromise for the sake of peace. But we don't. We are allowed to have our own choices and sovereignty. They can say what they want and that's fine. But we are not required to obey stupidity.",

Do NOT have sex with him again, he lied about wanting kids and might tamper with your birth control to baby trap you.\n\nTake the job and move on with your life. First it's the job, then this guy won't want you talking with the male waiter, or hanging out with guy friends, or having a job at all bc you'll have male coworkers. Besides, he'll want you home with the babies he plans to trap you with. He'll isolate you from everyone eventually. You shouldn't have ignored those red flags, bc controlling people never want to give up control, and he'll never change. Get out now while you can get away cleanly (meaning you won't have to coparent with him for the rest of your life).\n\nIn future relationships, when you see red flags, walk away. NEVER brush these toxic behaviors off as no big deal bc he's just \"so wonderful\" in other ways, and he promises to change this one thing. People are fundamentally who they are, and they don't change, especially toxic behaviors. You can't be so naive about that. \n\nAnd take a lot longer to get to know someone before you marry them - you've only been together 1.5 years and you're married already?! What was the rush? If you don't want children then you're not fighting your biological clock, so take your time before you jump in so quickly. It typically takes 2-3 years for the honeymoon phase to pass and to really know someone. For now though, just gtfo of this marriage and take that job, and don't fall for his renewed promises to change if you'll just stay - it's a lie and a trap. RUN!",

Since you got married quick, you\u2019re building that trust foundation now.. trust is earned and not just given. This takes time, communication and understanding. Dinners can seem intimate for a lot of people. I would feel uncomfortable if my husband did that for work and I 100% trust him. If you were feeling insecure, you would want reassurance from him. Not for him to put you down and call you controlling. This is what a marriage is all about, you have to learn to work and live with someone who isn\u2019t going to always be on the same page or have different views than you. AND THATS OKAY. I really think if you can work on these things and figure it out it\u2019s going to make your relationship stronger in the end. Ask him why he feels this way, make him feel heard. Try to understand where he\u2019s coming from. You\u2019re allowed to tell him your feelings too, just don\u2019t play the blame game. If it gets heated, take a break. You have to believe in your marriage and put in work to actually make it work. I hope you guys can. \n\nAs for your MIL, again you should address this with your husband. You guys are a team and since you both agreed to no kids, it really shouldn\u2019t matter that much what she thinks to either of you. Don\u2019t let it get to you",

If you want your marriage to work, I always suggest marriage counseling eventually. It can help with issues you are having a hard time communicating about, whether it's with him or his mother.\n\nHowever, it doesn't sound like you've even had a sit down talk on your own with your husband about these issues. I would definitely do that first.  I would address his issues first and explain to him while his possessiveness can be nice in some situations, it does not make sense for him to act this way about a potential job. Most jobs, unless you're going for something fully remote, it's going to have you interact with the opposite sex. Whether it's a client, colleague, or superior/boss. He needs to tell you what his real concern is about that, besides possessiveness because it's causing an issue with you trying to get a job.  See how he reacts to that first before you go on to talking about his mother or deciding what you want to do. If he gets volatile or verbally abusive, you need to leave the house and go somewhere safe.  If he is receptive, that is a wonderful sign and you can go on to tell him that he needs to shut his mother down about grandchildren and she needs to not be so invasive.  Best of luck OP!",

Honestly, there were some red flags during our dating period, but he promised to change, and I focused on the good parts, so I decided to go ahead with the marriage.\n\nNow, I'm out of a job and have been interviewing. I recently got an offer for a client-facing role, which would involve meeting with clients, attending conferences, and yes, professional dinners. My husband has expressed discomfort with this, especially the part about meeting with male clients. He is quite possessive and doesn\u2019t want me going to dinners with guys, even though it's strictly professional. This controlling behavior is exactly one of the red flags I thought he'd change.\n\nTo make things more complicated, his mother recently asked if I was pregnant in the middle of an unrelated conversation. When I told her we aren't planning on having children (something my husband and I agreed on), she seemed shocked and pressed on why we made that decision, expressing her desire to be a grandparent.\n\nI feel trapped and creeped out, just one month into our marriage. My husband's possessiveness over my career and his mom's invasive questions about our decision not to have kids are raising serious concerns for me. I thought these issues were addressed before we got married, but now I'm facing them head-on.\n\nI'm not sure how to handle this situation or how to communicate my concerns without causing a huge conflict. Is this normal? Any advice on how to deal with possessive behavior and overbearing in-laws would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks for listening.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
