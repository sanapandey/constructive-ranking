    "selftext": "I have a friend that lives in the Texas and is a canadian immigrant / legal permanent resident whose permanent residency is expiring next year.\n\nHer bd was abusive mentally, emotionally, physically, and sexually (how she got pregnant) even before pregnancy and continued into pregnancy. So she left him and fled the state but never reported any of the incidents, she just told her friends and family and the domestic abuse hotline.\n\nWhen she had her baby she didn\u2019t put him on the birth certificate and still offered to let him see the baby on her terms and conditions. The baby is now two years old and her bd has only seen him three times in his life all of which mom had funded entirely.\n\nHe has never supported the baby in any way financially, physically or emotionally and has continued to be verbally and mentally abusive to the mother any time he doesn\u2019t get his way.\n\nBd is now in school to get a high paying job that will require a LOT of travel. He is threatening to take mom to court for custody saying he wants rights to his child even though during pregnancy he said he didn\u2019t and even told her to off herself and the baby.\n\nShe is worried because she does not currently have a job as of a week ago, but she does have a place for her and the baby to live where she is paying bills monthly.\n\nShe has also moved around a bit since he was born, but is now back on her feet with a stable and is just saving up to get a place of their own. She had to move the baby out of the apartment they had because she found mold in the ac unit and that wasn\u2019t safe for her baby. So she and the baby are staying with a friend in their own room (she pays bills there).\n\nShe has solely taken care of baby his entire life, feeding, clothing, activities and provided all necessary healthcare (regular doctor\u2019s appointments as well as speech and occupational therapy and will soon be tested for autism).\n\nShe is asking if she should flee the US back to her home country (Canada) before he files for custody or do you think she can fight it when she starts working again and has her name on a lease? She is worried that he will get there baby over night. Additional information about bd is that he has another older kid that he has supervised visits for. Not sure if that matters or not.",

                    "body": "This!! She needs not tell him  info especially when he hasn't asked, stop facilitating him being a dad(and have proof of what she has done to fund it just in case)and he can deal with the whole court process including proving paternity.  He can't even deal with a visit like an adult to be a father and I am sure that is provable in court should it come to that. He has never lived where they are and she has a history of moving so he leaving before her visa expires (not to mention this country declared a trade war on her home) is a reasonable thing. The up side is that he will have a hard enough time forcing anything as a resident of a different state much less country.  She doesn't need to fight for anything just do what any rational paretn would continue to do. Besides when he realizes that means child support, child care and medical costs, I don't see  following through, he has never yet. But I get how absolutely terrified she is. So maybe help her research what court would look like. I know my step dad had to file in the home state of his kid for anything and that was only his home state for 6 months. He had lived here with both parents his entire 10 years. She went to visit her parents,  kept extending the visit at his cost and filed as soon as it was considered his home state. And he was on the birth certificate and got visitation. So maybe knowing the usual court process in her area as well as what it would be in Canada could be helpful.  But she doesn't have to fight this until he actually does it. So she should do what is best for them and ignore him and his threats until it is official. Good luck. I am sure this is terrifying.",

Without telling him or anyone else he might find out from. And stop communicating with him. \n\nPlus, Canada has free health care and more social programs. It's really a no-brainer.\n\n(not legal advice)",

He could drag her through so much legal and expenses and win 50/50 if they are close to each other.Then she may never be able to go back to her home country or worse, be forced to leave and separated from her child as HER situation changed and not his so he could be awarded full custody. It\u2019s a nightmare scenario and she should go back to her home country if possible.",

So she left him and fled the state but never reported any of the incidents, she just told her friends and family and the domestic abuse hotline.\n\nWhen she had her baby she didn\u2019t put him on the birth certificate and still offered to let him see the baby on her terms and conditions. The baby is now two years old and her bd has only seen him three times in his life all of which mom had funded entirely.\n\nHe has never supported the baby in any way financially, physically or emotionally and has continued to be verbally and mentally abusive to the mother any time he doesn\u2019t get his way.\n\nBd is now in school to get a high paying job that will require a LOT of travel. He is threatening to take mom to court for custody saying he wants rights to his child even though during pregnancy he said he didn\u2019t and even told her to off herself and the baby.\n\nShe is worried because she does not currently have a job as of a week ago, but she does have a place for her and the baby to live where she is paying bills monthly.\n\nShe has also moved around a bit since he was born, but is now back on her feet with a stable and is just saving up to get a place of their own. She had to move the baby out of the apartment they had because she found mold in the ac unit and that wasn\u2019t safe for her baby. So she and the baby are staying with a friend in their own room (she pays bills there).\n\nShe has solely taken care of baby his entire life, feeding, clothing, activities and provided all necessary healthcare (regular doctor\u2019s appointments as well as speech and occupational therapy and will soon be tested for autism).\n\nShe is asking if she should flee the US back to her home country (Canada) before he files for custody or do you think she can fight it when she starts working again and has her name on a lease? She is worried that he will get there baby over night. Additional information about bd is that he has another older kid that he has supervised visits for. Not sure if that matters or not.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She is legally present and between jobs - that doesn\u2019t remotely make her an unfit parent or unworthy of custody.\n\nI am a Canadian born person who moved to the USA at 25 (green card first then became a citizen) so I def have some firsthand knowledge of the system.  She should consider filing for citizenship - she\u2019s likely eligible at this point and it is about the same cost as renewing the green card.  Nothing this ex can say about is going to mean anything related to her immigration status.\n\nDocument everything and fight.\n\nHonestly maybe she needs to be asked \u201cis there anything more worth fighting for?  Is this a person you want raising your child?\u201d",
