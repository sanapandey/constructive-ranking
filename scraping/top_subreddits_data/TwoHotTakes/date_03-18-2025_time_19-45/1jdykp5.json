    "selftext": "Hi! \n\nI am 8 weeks postpartum and my baby just got his first set of vaccine. ( I get this topic is also controversial but to each their own ) After we got home, I set my baby for success. I applied cold compress on the injection site, rubbed a soothing gel after. Gave him a tylenol so he doesn\u2019t spike a fever. And he was great the entire day. \n\nNight time comes and he was having a hard time. So, I gave him a warm bath. Applied soothing gel on the injection site. 20 mins after he was still not having it, so I gave him a good chest rub. I told the baby daddy about it and he said \u201c is that supposed to help? Idk where youre getting all of this\u201d and it triggered something inside of me. For context, I am the MAIN caretaker of our baby. He is a student pilot at the moment and unemployed. He mostly play on his computer, the whole freaking daaayyy! He doesn\u2019t hear anything from me. \n\nAnyways back to the story. Tylenol was outside the room so, I called him and ask him to bring the medicine to me. Take note, my baby has been up for hours at this point.  As I was about to give my son another ml, he reacted and said \u201c I would just let his body react/adopt to it \u201c cause we could tell his legs are sore. So, I didn\u2019t give the tylenol, he left the room to play AGAIN!!!! thats when I made the decision of giving my son the medicine with his bottle. 10 mins after his soothe and asleep. Am I the asshole for doing that? \n\nI just also think that if I\u2019m the main caregiver of our child. You should respect my decision in cases like this. Cause while he is outside playing and in his element. I\u2019m the one left alone with a fussy baby. Honestly he doesn\u2019t do anything. \n\nUpdate: Yes, we talked to our family doctor about it and she suggested to give infant tylenol. \n\nAnd yes guys, its infant tylenol with correct dosage. \nI also know I have to talk to him at some point but I just don\u2019t have the energy for that right now. i am already exhausted just thinking about it.

I'd always give mine Tylenol before the injection and every 4 hours after as needed, as long as they were still grumpy and fussy. The vaccines always caused them to run a low fever, and Tylenol made them feel so much better. \n\nAlways follow your instincts. You know your baby better than anyone. If you feel like he needs Tylenol to ease his pain, don't let someone tell you you're wrong (obviously as long as you're following dosing instructions etc).",

( I get this topic is also controversial but to each their own ) After we got home, I set my baby for success. I applied cold compress on the injection site, rubbed a soothing gel after. Gave him a tylenol so he doesn\u2019t spike a fever. And he was great the entire day. \n\nNight time comes and he was having a hard time. So, I gave him a warm bath. Applied soothing gel on the injection site. 20 mins after he was still not having it, so I gave him a good chest rub. I told the baby daddy about it and he said \u201c is that supposed to help? Idk where youre getting all of this\u201d and it triggered something inside of me. For context, I am the MAIN caretaker of our baby. He is a student pilot at the moment and unemployed. He mostly play on his computer, the whole freaking daaayyy! He doesn\u2019t hear anything from me. \n\nAnyways back to the story. Tylenol was outside the room so, I called him and ask him to bring the medicine to me. Take note, my baby has been up for hours at this point.  As I was about to give my son another ml, he reacted and said \u201c I would just let his body react/adopt to it \u201c cause we could tell his legs are sore. So, I didn\u2019t give the tylenol, he left the room to play AGAIN!!!! thats when I made the decision of giving my son the medicine with his bottle. 10 mins after his soothe and asleep. Am I the asshole for doing that? \n\nI just also think that if I\u2019m the main caregiver of our child. You should respect my decision in cases like this. Cause while he is outside playing and in his element. I\u2019m the one left alone with a fussy baby. Honestly he doesn\u2019t do anything. \n\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
