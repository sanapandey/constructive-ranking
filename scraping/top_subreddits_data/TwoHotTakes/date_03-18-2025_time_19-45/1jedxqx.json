    "selftext": "\nI (22F) have been with my boyfriend, Nate (22M), for six years. He is a great guy\u2014he treats me well and is the person I want to marry.\n\nWe both attend the same university. During my freshman year, I became very close with my roommate, Katie (23F). We did everything together and ultimately became best friends. Since she was such an important part of my life, I introduced her to Nate. At first, they didn\u2019t talk much, but after about a year of knowing each other, that changed.\n\nKatie switched her major to biology, which is also Nate\u2019s major. Nate is a tutor for our university\u2019s academic program and enjoys teaching, so he and Katie ended up taking multiple classes together and studying in the same group, along with our mutual friend, Josh (22M). I thought it was nice that we could all go to the library together\u2014I would study for my exams while my friends studied for theirs. Over the summer, Nate even helped Katie get a research position in his lab, as well as a job at the urgent care where he works. It was really kind of him to do that for a friend.\n\nThat same summer, the four of us\u2014Nate, Katie, Josh, and I\u2014went on a cruise together. But after that trip, I noticed a shift. Katie rarely texted or called me anymore. Whenever we did hang out, it was always brief, usually just a quick lunch. She also started inviting Nate to our meetups, even when I just wanted some girl time.\n\nSince the summer, Nate and Katie have been hanging out alone at least twice a week\u2014usually in the research lab, grabbing lunch in between, or doing other things together.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Since the start of my senior year, they\u2019ve started hanging out outside of school without me, often without telling me. One instance that really hurt my feelings was when Katie went over to Nate\u2019s apartment to watch a cartoon movie she wanted to see. At the time, I had been trying to make plans with Katie, but she kept saying she was busy. Then, when I looked out my window, I saw her walking into Nate\u2019s apartment. (Nate and I live in the same apartment complex.)\n\nI opened my window, shouted \u201cHi!\u201d and told her I was coming down. She didn\u2019t seem enthusiastic. When I got to Nate\u2019s apartment, I asked what she was doing there, and she said they were just hanging out before their meeting at school. I felt hurt that neither of them had texted me to invite me, especially since they knew I was home with no classes at that time.\n\nOver time, this kept happening. I wouldn\u2019t find out they were hanging out unless I checked their locations on Find My Friends or heard about it later. I told Nate that it hurt my feelings that Katie barely spoke to me anymore and constantly flaked on our plans. He responded by saying, \u201cWe\u2019re just closer now than you and Katie are.\u201d\n\nI told him I found it weird that my best friend had suddenly become his best friend. Not only that, but he\u2019s done a lot for her\u2014he got her a job, a research position, helped her apply to PA school, and more. Most of my other friends have also told me it\u2019s strange how much time they spend together without me.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019ve started to feel insecure. What\u2019s so wrong with me that Katie doesn\u2019t want to hang out anymore? It\u2019s not that she\u2019s too busy or has other friends\u2014she only really spends time with me, Nate, and Josh. And Nate\u2019s only real friends are Katie and Josh, though we don\u2019t see Josh as often.\n\nTo test things, I decided not to text Katie for a month to see if she would reach out first. She never did. That really hurt.\n\nI told Nate that I was uncomfortable with how much time they were spending together, especially since Katie and I hadn\u2019t seen each other in three months. His response was:\n\n\u201cIt may be untraditional, but it\u2019s a good friendship for me. You should be grateful I have a friend, because honestly, if she weren\u2019t my friend, I\u2019d have no one to talk to other than you. I know it\u2019s \u2018weird,\u2019 but it hurts my feelings that you\u2019re so against it. I don\u2019t like that you\u2019d rather me have zero friends than have an untraditional friendship.\u201d\n\nThen, a few days ago, I noticed his location was at a shop. I texted him, asking what he was doing, and he said, \u201cShopping.\u201d He didn\u2019t mention who he was with. When I asked, it took him longer than usual to answer. Finally, he admitted he was with Katie. I asked why he didn\u2019t just tell me, and he said, \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want to upset you.\u201d\n\nHe also accused me of being selfish and jealous. And honestly\u2026 maybe I am jealous. I don\u2019t know what to do at this point. I asked him to stop seeing Katie outside of school, or at least to cut back on how much time they spend together. Is that unfair of me? How should I handle this? Any advice would help so much.\n\nEdit: For some comments and to add more background. \n\n-Katie has been single her whole life and has never had a boyfriend. \n-When I asked Nate about feeling uncomfortable he said he would never cheat on me and he pointed out he finds Katie very unattractive. \n-He hasn\u2019t \u201clied\u201d to me but has rather just not mentioned anything. So he doesn\u2019t say I\u2019m hanging out with Katie today. He just does it and I find out through his location or seeing her at his place. \n",

            "body": "The most likely reason Katie isn't hanging out with you is that she wants to have Nate, and feels guilty.   It's easier to stop being your friend so she doesn't have to face you. And it's entirely possible they are having a relationship behind your back. \n\nMen and women can be friends and have boundaries in those relationships that make their partners feel secure.  Calling it an \"untraditional\" friendship seems odd - isn't it just a friendship?\n\nNate's comment that you should be grateful he has a friend is kind of odd as well.  You're not prohibiting him from having friends.  You have tried to voice your feelings about a particular friendship that makes you uncomfortable.\n\nPlease stop checking his location on-line, and questioning who he is with.  You're only going to drive yourself crazy.  And you look crazy and jealous by doing it.\n\nIs Nate spending less time with you overall?  Is he spending less quality time with you? I'm getting more of a vibe that you are hurt and confused more than being jealous.  You feel left out by you boyfriend and your former best friend.  Bluntly, if other friends are noticing how much time Nate and Katie spend together without you and are commenting on it, there is something to it.\n\nSit down with Nate and tell him that while you are happy he has friends, you feel like he is not putting the same effort into your relationship that you are.  Ask him point blank if he wants to break up with you and date Katie.  If he says yes, let him go and move on.  If he says no, ask him to commit to being more transparent about the friendship with Katie, and to focus more on your relationship - try to be specific about what you want.",

I asked for consideration with what they watch together (I\u2019m uncomfortable with them watching rated R for nudity things together). He compromised with me there. \n\nWhile I will always be uncomfortable with their friendship, we have conversations and he cares about me enough to listen to how I\u2019m feeling and willing to discuss solutions that work for the both of us. \n\nMy biggest piece of advice (that comes from being almost 40 & studying healthy relationships) is that your significant other should care about your feelings & prioritize those above friendships. Nate should be open & willing to discuss this situation with you and how it can get better. If that isn\u2019t happening, end the relationship & find someone who will prioritize you.",

Doing things that hurt you and then manipulating you by saying things like, \u201cYou should be grateful\u201d about being hurt is crazy. And you\u2019re wrong when you say he treats you well. This is not how you treat a partner \u201cwell\u201d",

            "body": "Backup of the post's body: I (22F) and my boyfriend (22M) who we will call Nate have been together for 6 years. He is a great guy. Treats me very well and is the person I want to marry. \n\nWe both go to the same university. My freshman year I became very close with my roommate (23F) who we\u2019ll call Katie. We did everything together and ultimately became best friends. Since she was my best friend i introduced her to Nate. They didn\u2019t really talk around each other until a year of knowing each other. Katie changed her major to biology which is Nate\u2019s major. Nate is a tutor for our Universities academic program and enjoys teaching. Katie and Nate took multiple classes together and had a study group along with another one of our mutual friends Josh (22 M). I thought it was so nice how we could go to the library and I would study for my exams while my friends studied together. Over the summer Nate was able to help Katie get a research position in the lab he works in as well as a job at an urgent care he works at. It is very nice of him to do that for someone especially a friend. During the summer we also went on a cruise together. Nate, Katie, Josh and I. Since after the summer I noticed Katie rarely would text or call me. Every-time me and her would hang out would be extremely short and over a quick lunch. She would even invite Nate to come and hang out with us even though I just wanted girl time. Since the summer him and Katie hang out together alone at least 2 times a week. Usually in the research lab, getting lunch in between, or something like that.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem. Since the start of my senior year Nate and Katie have hung out outside of school without me on multiple occasions without telling me. One instance that really hurt my feelings was when Katie went to Nate\u2019s house to watch a cartoon movie she wanted to see. I was trying to arrange a time for me and Katie to hang out. Next thing I know I look out the window and she\u2019s at my boyfriend\u2019s apartment. (Me and Nate live in the same apartment complex). I opened the window and shouted hi and told her I was coming down. Which she didn\u2019t seem enthusiastic about. I went over to Nate\u2019s and asked them what she was doing there and she said they were just going to hang out until their meeting at school. At the time I felt hurt that neither him or her texted me to ask me to come over with them. Especially since I live across the street and they knew I didn\u2019t have any classes at that time. Overtime this kept happening where they would hang out and I wouldn\u2019t know until later or if I checked their locations on find my friends. I told Nate that it hurt my feelings she barely talked to me anymore and always flaked out on when we were supposed to hang out. He told me that they are just closer now than me and Katie are. \n\nI told him I find it weird that my best friend has suddenly become his best friend. Not only that but he does a lot for her. He got her a job, a research position, helped her apply to PA school and a lot more. Most of my other friends told me it was weird that my boyfriend and friend would hang out together all the time without me. Overtime I have started to feel insecure. What\u2019s so wrong with me that Katie doesn\u2019t want to hang out anymore? It\u2019s not because she is busy or has other friends either. Im not being mean when I say me, Nate and Josh are her only friends. As well as Nates only friends are Katie and Josh. Though we don\u2019t see Josh much. I told myself I wouldn\u2019t text her for a month to see if she would text first since I\u2019m always the one reaching out to see her. Of course she didn\u2019t reach out and it really hurt. I told Nate that I have started to feel uncomfortable and not ok with how much time they spend together and the fact that Katie and I haven\u2019t seen each other in 3 months. He responded by saying \n\u201cMay be untraditional but it\u2019s a good friendship for me. You should be grateful I have a friendship. Bc tbh if she wasn\u2019t my friend, I\u2019d have no one to talk to other than you.\nI know it\u2019s \u201cweird\u201d but it hurts my feelings that you\u2019re so against it. I don\u2019t like that you\u2019d rather me have 0 friends rather than have an untraditional friendship\u201d\n\nAlso I was looking at his location and saw he was at a shop with her. I texted him asking what he was doing and said shopping. Didn\u2019t mention he was with Katie. I asked with who and it took him a little too long to answer. I asked why he didn\u2019t mention he was with her and he said because he didn\u2019t want to upset me. \n\nHe also accused me of being selfish and jealous. Which I guess is true. Honestly I don\u2019t know what to do at this point. I asked him to stop seeing her or at least hanging out outside of school. Is that unfair of me? How should I go about this? Any advice would help so much\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
