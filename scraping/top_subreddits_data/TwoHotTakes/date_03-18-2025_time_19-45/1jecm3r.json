    "selftext": "Me, (F 29) I at my breaking point and don\u2019t know what to do anymore. My husband (M 32) has been struggling with a gambling addiction for the last two years, and it has completely destroyed our financial stability. Before I married him, I had zero debt and a stellar credit report. Now, we are over $100K in debt, using credit cards just to pay rent, and barely making ends meet.\n\nHe has gambled away our paychecks, rent money, and any savings we had. On top of that, his parents constantly ask him for money, which only fuels his addiction because he gambles to try to give them what they want. We fight almost every day, and though he acknowledges that this is a problem, promises to change, and swears he will never gamble again, I just don\u2019t know if I can trust him anymore. My trust in him is shattered in more ways than one.\n\nI love him, but I feel like I\u2019m drowning. Part of me wants to believe he can change, but another part wonders if I need to walk away to save myself financially and emotionally. Has anyone been through something similar? Can a marriage survive this level of betrayal and financial ruin? Or am I just delaying the inevitable?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.",

In a lot of simple divorces, yes, they just split everything equally, assets an debts. \n\nBut a good attorney, in certain states, can argue against that gambling debt specifically. The term \"equitable\" in a divorce suit doesn't always mean 50/50. Even though she may have to carry 50% of that debt, in exchange a good attorney may get her more than 50% of their assets during the divorce to help offset this. \n\nBut yeah either way she's going to be fucked to some degree, and it's only going to get worse the longer she stays.",

I do want to say though that suggesting alcoholism and drug abuse only affects the individual and not the whole family is just not accurate. Both of those things (alcoholism and drug abuse) are on the list of adverse childhood experiences for the ACE scale for a reason. It's widely accepted that alcoholism and drug abuse cause trauma to the whole family of the person with the problem.\n\nOn a personal note, there's a permanent hole in my family where my alcohol and drug abusing father used to be. I wish he just had a gambling addiction. He is literally not the same person I used to know. I think he has brain damage that literally makes him incapable of empathizing with other people or forming meaningful emotional connections. Maybe a gambling addiction is just as bad though, I don't have personal experience with that one.",

I wasn't sure what to do and started really paying attention to the other things he did in his life.  After some other risky behaviors (one was very serious, the others weren't but it pointed to a pattern), I insisted he go to therapy.  Gambling was just a symptom of a much larger problem and he had some serious impulse control issues.  I ended up walking away.  After I did, I caught snippets from mutual friends about how his life was going and it was not good.\n\n>I love him, but I feel like I\u2019m drowning\n\nThis is key.  I felt the exact same way.  I related it to babysitting a toddler who was running around the house and there were no baby gates preventing the toddler from falling down the stairs.  It was so stressful and I felt that I was always on high alert.  It wasn't a partnership and I was being forced into the role of his mother.",

The bankruptcy will not only help you escape some of the burden of this debt, but it has the added benefit of uncovering all loans, etc. he has taken out without your knowledge, because I'm sure they exist. Lock your credit, move out so you are no longer sharing a lease, rent, bills, or address, and make sure he does not have access to your bank accounts.
