    "selftext": "\nHey everyone! So I broke up with my boyfriend after a year together back in jan. He took 9 months to tell his family about me, and 10 to ask me to actually be his girlfriend, however by this point, we were certainly together. He was going out with other girls for coffee but didn\u2019t see the issue with not telling me for months. He also accused me of cheating as I turned my location off, however I did this as i got incredibly sick, not being able to walk so was going nowhere. He would text me saying a girl won\u2019t stop texting him but never actually told them he was seeing someone, despite me encouraging him to say that. The list goes on, so needless to say I broke up with him (even though he couldn\u2019t understand why). \n\nI got back together with him a month or so later as I felt I didn\u2019t give him a chance. I explained my feelings and he said he loved to hear where he went wrong and that i should have said earlier (as if communication was the issue\u2026). First week back was great. I got flowers from him for the first time, and it seemed better UNTIL he said the reason I broke up with him must have been because me and my family were jealous of his achievements! He was making it very clear that he did not know what my issues were, and couldn\u2019t see a problem with his behaviour, despite him seeming pretty coherent when we rekindled. He also turned everyone against me after the first breakup, but then said it\u2019s my problem what people think of me. \n\nMy final straw was him asking me how much my rates were, got up and threw \u00a3300 of cash at me whilst I was on the bed, albeit doing it jokingly and I went along with it. I just don\u2019t think this is something one should do whilst trying again with the relationship. I ended things a few days ago as it just wasn\u2019t working. Aside from all that, we had a fun relationship! \n\nI feel as if I didn\u2019t really express my feelings enough in the relationship, and maybe instead of ending things, I should have said more of how I felt? Or should he have just used common sense to not treat me like that? But since he\u2019s now going around calling me a psycho to everyone, it makes me think I did make the right decision. Any advice appreciated!",

It sounds like you were there when it was convenient for him and he continued to date until he found something \u201cbetter\u201d. But he\u2019s a shit human and other women realized that, so he kept coming back to you. I really don\u2019t mean to be rude, but this was not a relationship. You were his backup chick that he knew he could run all over. I hope you are able to heal from this and realize you deserved WAY better.",
