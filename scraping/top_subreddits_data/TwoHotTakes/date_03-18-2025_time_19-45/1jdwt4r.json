    "selftext": "\nAbout a year ago, my best friend and I got engaged about two months apart. I\u2019ve always known I didn\u2019t want a wedding ceremony or reception, but my fianc\u00e9 insisted. So, I honored his wishes and started planning.\n\nAt the same time, my friend was planning her wedding and asked me to be her maid of honor. Typically, that role comes with planning the bachelorette party, so I found myself knee-deep in organizing that too. Then she asked me to throw her a combined wedding shower/housewarming party\u2014all of this coming out of my own pocket while I was also planning and paying for my own wedding and honeymoon.\n\nOn top of that, I was expected to buy a dress from a specific website, name-brand shoes, and get professional hair and makeup for her wedding day. I estimate I spent around $2,000 on her wedding events. The other bridesmaids offered to chip in for supplies more than once but never actually followed through.\n\nI chose not to have bridesmaids because I didn\u2019t want my friends to assume the financial burden of being in a bridal party, nor did I want to cover those costs for them. My plan was to have a small ceremony with immediate family, followed by a reception with all of our loved ones at the same venue.\n\nMy friend never offered to help throw me a wedding shower or bachelorette party, which I understood since she wasn\u2019t \u201cin the bridal party.\u201d But then again\u2014no one was. And she was well aware that she was my best friend. This wasn\u2019t the first time in our friendship that I felt like I was the only one putting in effort while she simply received.\n\nThe Red Flags Begin\n\nFlash forward to her wedding shower/housewarming party. After all the planning, purchases, and decorations\u2014set up for 75 guests\u2014only three people showed up. She spent the entire time entertaining those three while barely acknowledging me. I understood she was likely upset about the turnout, but it didn\u2019t excuse how she dismissed my presence. After all, of the 75 invited guests, I was the one who showed up, I was the one who planned it, I was the one who paid for it, set it up, attended, and cleaned up afterward. I even got a gift for them from her registry. It felt like I was nothing more than a free event planner, caterer, and host. \n\nThen came her bachelorette party. Luckily, this time, people actually showed up. But again, I felt more like an unpaid coordinator than a cherished friend. It felt like she saw my efforts as an obligation rather than a gift from a best friend. The next morning, our mutual friend and I got up early, cleaned everything, and packed up the cars\u2014while she stayed asleep in the common space where she could hear us (we were literally popping balloons). When we woke her up to say goodbye, all we got was a half-asleep, half-hearted \u201cthank you.\u201d\n\nThe Wedding\n\nTwo weeks before her wedding, I told her I had cleared my schedule to help with any last-minute planning. This meant driving 45 minutes to her place\u2014twice\u2014to help out.\n\nOn the day of her ceremony (a Friday, meaning I had to use PTO), she barely spoke to me but still expected me to have everything handled. And I did. No major issues, just that same underlying feeling that I was being taken advantage of as her Type A planner friend.\n\nThen it was time for my wedding. A mutual friend tried to plan a bachelorette party for me with her, but she didn\u2019t help\u2014so we canceled it to avoid stressing out our mutual friend.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to my wedding, that mutual friend and I met up multiple times to help finalize details. Meanwhile, my best friend never checked in.\n\nOn my wedding day, she sent me a text:\n\n\u201cIs there anything I can help you with?\u201d\n\nEverything was already done. It was too little, too late. It just reinforced the feeling that I was an afterthought\u2014that she only reached out because she had to, not because she actually wanted to.\n\nAt my reception, she realized she hadn\u2019t been invited to the ceremony and began crying. She proceeded to cry for most of the reception. And remember the gift I got her from her registry, despite everything I was doing for both her wedding and mine? She got us a card with cash. Which, I mean, sure\u2014I\u2019m not ungrateful\u2014but at that point, the sentiment mattered so much more to me. And she didn\u2019t even include a heartfelt note. She did come up to congratulate me\u2014while sobbing\u2014and later spoke with our mutual friend, who told her that whatever concerns she had needed to wait until after my honeymoon.\n\nShe didn\u2019t listen.\n\nThe Final Straw\n\nAt 2 AM on my wedding night, she sent me a long-ass paragraph about her feelings, her confusion, and her desire to \u201cfix\u201d our relationship.\n\nAt that point, I was done. I told her we\u2019d talk after I got back from my honeymoon.\n\nWhile I was away, I gained clarity. I realized I didn\u2019t see a point in talking things through because the root issues had been there for years. And I couldn\u2019t get past the fact that she thought it was acceptable to send me that message on my wedding night. It was yet another moment where her feelings took priority over my experience.\n\nIt\u2019s been four months since I cut her off.\n\nAITA?",

She was MOH in my first wedding. Back in those days (1980) bachelorette outings weren\u2019t full weekends or trips like we see today. It was her idea she\u2019d take me out for bachelorette drinks the night before my wedding. I didn\u2019t ask her to, it was definitely her idea. \n\nCome the week of the wedding, she tells me sorry, can\u2019t do it, because another friend will be in town that night and she just HAD to see him. You\u2019d assume from this that he was a romantic interest, but he wasn\u2019t. I pointed out to her that this was my wedding, a once in a lifetime thing (little did I know\u2026 he turned into Evil Starter Husband, but I digress). She didn\u2019t care. Because my other bridesmaid wasn\u2019t in town yet, I ended up going out that night with another friend who wasn\u2019t even in the wedding party\u2014and wished I\u2019d asked her to be MOH instead.\n\nAnd then I started thinking back. Like your \u201cfriend\u201d, she was also a person who always put her own wants ahead of everything and everyone else, no matter what. She\u2019d been treating me like a sidekick. 12 years later when I remarried, she was not invited.",

Your ex best friend sounds selfish, but you sound like a poor communicator and probably a lot more passive aggressive than you think. \n\nFor instance, why stew about not getting a bachelorette party? From your post you make it sound like you were completely unenthused about having wedding at all. Is it really so unreasonable that the people around you would assume you wouldn't want one? Why not say something if you did?\n\nDid you really have no idea that no one would show up to her shower? You got 75 affirmative RSVPs and then 72 of them decided to flake without saying anything? It's not impossible, but something tells me there's information missing here. \n\nWhy exactly did you take it upon yourself to be 'literally popping balloons' next to someone who was trying to sleep (and Im guessing was hungover) -  the guest of honor no less. You don't make any mention of needing to vacate the property (like if it was an AirBnB) and she was still sleeping when you left which makes me think that it wasn't exactly urgent. Are you sure you weren't just trying to get back at her for whatever perceived slights you felt at the party?\n\nWhy did you disinvite her from the ceremony without telling her, and choose to have her find out by unknowingly showing up to just the reception? That was pretty cruel, and totally unnecessary. That obviously doesn't excuse her behavior at the reception or later on that night, but it's hard to feel bad for you when you're the one that chose that time and place to make such a passive agressive statement.\n\nBy all means, sever ties. You guys sound toxic for each other. But please don't think that you're walking away smelling only of roses.\n\nEdit: typo",

            "body": "Backup of the post's body: \nAbout a year ago, my best friend and I got engaged about two months apart. I\u2019ve always known I didn\u2019t want a wedding ceremony or reception, but my fianc\u00e9 insisted. So, I honored his wishes and started planning.\n\nAt the same time, my friend was planning her wedding and asked me to be her maid of honor. Typically, that role comes with planning the bachelorette party, so I found myself knee-deep in organizing that too. Then she asked me to throw her a combined wedding shower/housewarming party\u2014all of this coming out of my own pocket while I was also planning and paying for my own wedding and honeymoon.\n\nOn top of that, I was expected to buy a dress from a specific website, name-brand shoes, and get professional hair and makeup for her wedding day. I estimate I spent around $2,000 on her wedding events. The other bridesmaids offered to chip in for supplies more than once but never actually followed through.\n\nI chose not to have bridesmaids because I didn\u2019t want my friends to assume the financial burden of being in a bridal party, nor did I want to cover those costs for them. My plan was to have a small ceremony with immediate family, followed by a reception with all of our loved ones at the same venue.\n\nMy friend never offered to help throw me a wedding shower or bachelorette party, which I understood since she wasn\u2019t \u201cin the bridal party.\u201d But then again\u2014no one was. And she was well aware that she was my best friend. This wasn\u2019t the first time in our friendship that I felt like I was the only one putting in effort while she simply received.\n\nThe Red Flags Begin\n\nFlash forward to her wedding shower/housewarming party. After all the planning, purchases, and decorations\u2014set up for 75 guests\u2014only three people showed up. She spent the entire time entertaining those three while barely acknowledging me. I understood she was likely upset about the turnout, but it didn\u2019t excuse how she dismissed my presence. After all, of the 75 invited guests, I was the one who showed up, I was the one who planned it, I was the one who paid for it, set it up, attended, and cleaned up afterward. I even got a gift for them from her registry. It felt like I was nothing more than a free event planner, caterer, and host. \n\nThen came her bachelorette party. Luckily, this time, people actually showed up. But again, I felt more like an unpaid coordinator than a cherished friend. It felt like she saw my efforts as an obligation rather than a gift from a best friend. The next morning, our mutual friend and I got up early, cleaned everything, and packed up the cars\u2014while she stayed asleep in the common space where she could hear us (we were literally popping balloons). When we woke her up to say goodbye, all we got was a half-asleep, half-hearted \u201cthank you.\u201d\n\nThe Wedding\n\nTwo weeks before her wedding, I told her I had cleared my schedule to help with any last-minute planning. This meant driving 45 minutes to her place\u2014twice\u2014to help out.\n\nOn the day of her ceremony (a Friday, meaning I had to use PTO), she barely spoke to me but still expected me to have everything handled. And I did. No major issues, just that same underlying feeling that I was being taken advantage of as her Type A planner friend.\n\nThen it was time for my wedding. A mutual friend tried to plan a bachelorette party for me with her, but she didn\u2019t help\u2014so we canceled it to avoid stressing out our mutual friend.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to my wedding, that mutual friend and I met up multiple times to help finalize details. Meanwhile, my best friend never checked in.\n\nOn my wedding day, she sent me a text:\n\n\u201cIs there anything I can help you with?\u201d\n\nEverything was already done. It was too little, too late. It just reinforced the feeling that I was an afterthought\u2014that she only reached out because she had to, not because she actually wanted to.\n\nAt my reception, she realized she hadn\u2019t been invited to the ceremony and began crying. She proceeded to cry for most of the reception. And remember the gift I got her from her registry, despite everything I was doing for both her wedding and mine? She got us a card with cash. Which, I mean, sure\u2014I\u2019m not ungrateful\u2014but at that point, the sentiment mattered so much more to me. And she didn\u2019t even include a heartfelt note. She did come up to congratulate me\u2014while sobbing\u2014and later spoke with our mutual friend, who told her that whatever concerns she had needed to wait until after my honeymoon.\n\nShe didn\u2019t listen.\n\nThe Final Straw\n\nAt 2 AM on my wedding night, she sent me a long-ass paragraph about her feelings, her confusion, and her desire to \u201cfix\u201d our relationship.\n\nAt that point, I was done. I told her we\u2019d talk after I got back from my honeymoon.\n\nWhile I was away, I gained clarity. I realized I didn\u2019t see a point in talking things through because the root issues had been there for years. And I couldn\u2019t get past the fact that she thought it was acceptable to send me that message on my wedding night. It was yet another moment where her feelings took priority over my experience.\n\nIt\u2019s been four months since I cut her off.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
