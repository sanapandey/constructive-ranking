    "selftext": "My (22F) long term boyfriend (23M) is slowly pushing me away because of his laziness and uncleanliness. \n\nLong story short we\u2019ve been together since we were in high school about 6 years. I\u2019ve never seen him sweep the floors, use the washer/dryer, fold clothes, take out trash, wash dishes, or clean a surface. But what he will do is leave his dinner plate out, open water bottles everywhere dirty clothes on the floor, jackets are thrown where ever he takes them off, anything he comes home with is thrown where ever he pleases. His office is beyond disgusting and filthy, he can\u2019t even keep his car clean. And with all of this we split bills 50/50. and I feel like more of a mother than anything at this point and it\u2019s really turning me off. I\u2019ve tried everything, said everything that can be said. I\u2019m starting to wonder if it\u2019s some sort of mental issue , he\u2019s not depressed so idek. Or if he is one of those who thinks taking care of the house is a \u201cwoman\u2019s job\u201d. I truly love him we\u2019ve been through so much together, we have 3 cats and we rent a home down the street from my family. I cannot afford this home on my own and loosing it would kill me.but I can\u2019t keep playing maid it\u2019s starting to really affect my mental health. What do I even do at this point? \n\nUpdates/ frequently asked questions: \n\nYes I\u2019ve discussed this with him. He cannot provide me with a straight forward answer as to why he doesn\u2019t help around the house or clean his own mess. When asked about the messes in his personal areas (office, car etc) he downplays the situations and says they\u2019re hardly messy/not a big deal. He just doesn\u2019t seem to comprehend on why this is such a huge deal.\n\nI\u2019ve showed him this post and claims I\u2019m making him out to be a \u201chorrible person\u201d and has created a huge problem spreading false/ made up information which does make me think mental issue \n\nThere were no men in his life for his mom to play maid for and his mom never did anything for him (didn\u2019t clean his room, do laundry etc)\n\nI also have adhd, bipolar, and depression so yea mental illness isn\u2019t really an excuse here ",

Most women have dated or married a man like this, they\u2019re a dime a dozen. In fact it\u2019s SO common for men to be this way towards their female partners that there are whole songs and books dedicated to the shit. \n\nMy children\u2019s father was this way. It\u2019s one of the main reasons we broke up. He didn\u2019t think he should have to do shit to lift a finger for our relationship but pay half of the bills. Yes I talked to him, yes I cried, yes I asked for counseling. He wasn\u2019t interested in any of that and told me that if I wanted help around the house or with the kids then I needed to contribute more to the bills (of which I already paid half). It was so bad he had me cleaning cat shit off of the floor while heavily pregnant (which is very dangerous for pregnant women) because he couldn\u2019t even handle scooping the litter box during my pregnancies. It was so bad I tore my stitches after a c-section giving birth to HIS son because even immediately post birth he refused to help with anything at all.\n\nGuess when he suddenly wanted to work on things?? When I told him I was leaving. \n\nThe reason women can speak definitively on this even if we don\u2019t personally know the men in these posts is because we\u2019ve all dated one or several of the same type of man. We\u2019ve all seen how this goes. This man is like all the rest of them that think women live to serve them and that they shouldn\u2019t ever have to put forth any effort.",

The truth is that love can and will develop between two mutually compatible people who respect each other and can develop trust. \n\nLove or rather that feeling of love is a chemical cocktail that makes you feel great when you are with someone. It isn\u2019t actual compatibility. \n\nThe longer you stay with someone who isn\u2019t your future, the longer it will take you to find the person who is. \n\nIt may sound like I have zero romance, but I believe that where trust, respect, and compatible morals and beliefs exist, love will always bloom. \n\nYour boyfriend doesn\u2019t respect you. So how can love exist between you?  You feel like a parent to this person, that is a common emotion in failed relationships. One party feels like the other is a chore or responsibility. Once you start feeling like the parent, sex becomes less desired because why would you sexually want someone who is like a child to you?\n\nYou know this relationship has run its course. Decide which pets are yours and which are his, talk to your parents about staying with them while you get back on your feet, and work with your landlord to end the lease. \n\nYou have a whole life ahead of you.

Believe him. Always believe them when they show you who they are.\n\nSo many of us ignored this red flag and ended up married to men who said things like, \"If you're so unhappy,  just leave.\" \n\nIt is SO MUCH HARDER to leave when there are children and mortgages and marriage contracts involved.  Every woman on here who has been a mommy bang maid in her life is telling you to run before you have any of these three things to deal with. We are telling you to run because this does not get better!! It gets worse. \n\nWork with your landlord to break the lease and look for a roommate situation. You will be so much happier.  \n\nLeaving my marital home and beautiful gardens was heartbreaking.... but it was so freeing to no longer be living in a toxic situation.

Make him put his big boy pants on and understand that he\u2019s not 16 living with mommy anymore. Tough love is the only way this will work and at that point if he doesn\u2019t fix it and grow up, he can\u2019t blame anybody but himself. \n\nI really feel for you here as a man in my 30\u2019s because this probably feels like such a pivotal time in life (and rightfully so!) and he\u2019s actually giving negative contributions to the relationship and your happiness.",

Unfortunately, our society has never even considered the idea of raising boys in a way where they don\u2019t end up relying on their future partners to manage their lives for them, emotionally and domestically. This is extremely common. \n\nI\u2019ve been single for a few years but lived with my last boyfriend. It got to the point where I couldn\u2019t take it anymore so I very gently (with the caveat that I wasn\u2019t patronizing him, just trying to help him understand where I\u2019m coming from) took him around our apartment and showed him how I clean and manage everything. So I tell him to load knives in the dishwasher blade side DOWN. The next day I reach into the dishwasher and I get stabbed by a steak knife loaded blade side up. I start to cry, mostly out of frustration, and all he can say is \u201cyou didn\u2019t tell me not to load them that way.\u201d No remorse, no apology. He also \u201ccleaned\u201d the bathroom by pouring bleach everywhere, so much so that we had to leave the apartment for a few hours while we let it air out. My boyfriend before that, I had a hysterectomy and was told not to lift ANYTHING for 6 weeks so I asked him just to take out the trash. That\u2019s it. The pile got to 6 bags before I caved, and after reminding him over and over again. \n\nSo trying to teach them didn\u2019t work, begging didn\u2019t work, and letting them live in filth didn\u2019t work. I\u2019ll never try to teach a man how to do these things again so all I have for you is encouragement to break up.",

You can't change this boy. He would have to be genuinely, for real, on every level, bought in and want to start improving himself before he will be capable of it. He's not there. That's why all the other times you've talked to him about it, he just said whatever it would take to get you to stop talking about it in that moment, whether it was a fully conscious lie that he'll do better or even if he thought he sort of meant it at the time. But he didn't. Actions following those conversations are telling you this change, that you need to be happy, is not important to him, and as long as you keep putting up with it, it'll never happen.\u00a0\n\n\nYou started as a teen dating a boy, and now you need to leave because you are an adult who cannot be dating someone who's still a child.

I\u2019ve never seen him sweep the floors, use the washer/dryer, fold clothes, take out trash, wash dishes, or clean a surface. But what he will do is leave his dinner plate out, open water bottles everywhere dirty clothes on the floor, jackets are thrown where ever he takes them off, anything he comes home with is thrown where ever he pleases. His office is beyond disgusting and filthy, he can\u2019t even keep his car clean. And with all of this we split bills 50/50. and I feel like more of a mother than anything at this point and it\u2019s really turning me off. I\u2019ve tried everything, said everything that can be said. I\u2019m starting to wonder if it\u2019s some sort of mental issue , he\u2019s not depressed so idek. Or if he is one of those who thinks taking care of the house is a \u201cwoman\u2019s job\u201d.

In this situation what I would do is start planning some sort of exit strategy. Start unmeshing your life. While you're doing this I would also stop doing things like their laundry and see how they act. There's hundreds of videos on YouTube and even accounts that specifically teach you how to be an adult. It takes all of 2 minutes to Google how to use your specific laundry machine if he doesn't know how to use it. While you're separating your finances and hopefully planning some sort of Exit Plan strategy you can see how he acts when there's any sort of push back like you not doing his laundry. Could you imagine if you had children with this person you would literally be doing everything.

She had a little PP depression and anxiety the first few weeks, like most of us do, while your hormones level out, but her & her doctor said she was all good at around 8 weeks PP. She was also like that the entire time she was pregnant  but wasn't like that before. They're both young (early 20s) and both my son & I thought she'd grow up some after the baby was born. I think it's just a matter of immaturity. She still has to call her mom every time she has a question (not Google, not her fiance... Her mom). Her bank called her a couple months ago to verify transactions to make sure there wasn't fraud on her account. She legit turned to my son in a panic and said, \"They said someone spent $22 at Walmart and they want to know if it was me -- what do I tell them!?!?\" \n\nIDK -- I think it's somewhat due to immaturity, but also, she wasn't like this before she got pregnant. It makes me wonder if she was doing what she thought she needed to get my son to marry her (pregnancy accidentally came first) or if there's something else going on. She told him a couple of weeks ago that sometimes she makes bigger messes on the house and doesn't clean them up on purpose because \"she's tired of hearing him nagging and b-tching.\" Like she does it for spite.",

On certain days we had chores. Growing up I had to cook dinner once a week. Dishes twice a week. And regular household chores varied from day to day. Being raised this way it set me in a habit of just waiting for chore day. I moved out when I was 17 and lived with friends till I was 22. When I finally got my own place I was working around 50-60 hours a week and doing laundry or dishes after work just never worked for me. I would go all week without doing the dishes or laundry. I wouldn\u2019t leave my plates or bowls around the house I would always bring them to the kitchen. But forget wiping down the counters or anything like that till Saturday came around.  Fast forward to 25 my girlfriend moved in with me. We have a child together and I make good money so she is a stay at home mom. We clashed heads on my ideology of waiting till the weekend to do chores. We had several arguments about said subject. It took me a long while to break the habit of leaving my dirty clothes in the bathroom and not rinsing my dishes after I\u2019m done with them. I always figured. \u201cWell I make the money so she can handle the chores\u201d absolutely not. It took almost losing her for me to wake up and realize I\u2019m not a child anymore and putting things off for another day is just setting yourself up for failure. Fast forward to me being almost 27 I can\u2019t imagine going back to living like that. Having a made bed to crawl into and a clean kitchen to cook breakfast and prepare my lunch in makes all the difference. She still handles a lot of the day to day but I definitely make an effort to help out as much as I can. We sat down together and talked about it several times. Went through all our bad habits and came up with solutions for them. It took us about a month to find a routine and stick to it. My point being. If you really love him you\u2019ll bring this to his attention, talk it out, and compromise on a solution. If he doesn\u2019t get himself together and make an effort. Just leave. You\u2019ll waste so much time and energy trying to get him to take care of the house with you. If he can\u2019t change then he isn\u2019t who you should be with. If he can\u2019t clean up after himself what do you think will happen when you want help with a project around the house? Find yourself a man. Not a little boy.",

It's a make it or break it for me, seriously, I need to stress on this fact that I'm absolutely over doing this.\n\nTell you what, I know my bedroom clothes pile bothers you; I'll try to be better at my upkeep with that if you can maybe promise to pick up after yourself better? We can make it a fun competition if you like, you can even pick the punishment for the loser!   \n That could be really fun.  I just know having a cleaner place will help with both of our anxiety and we can have people over without feeling weird about our mess, because there won't be much of one! I could see you showing off this place to your friends more, too. Do you think we could do something like that ? \"\n\nIf its a positive response, chances are itll stick longer than the typical discussion about how crappy it is to adult .\n\nBest of luck!!!",
