You absolutely did the right thing trusting your gut. Two years of gaslighting and being made to feel \"crazy\" is unacceptable, and the fact that you even went to therapy for *his* issues speaks volumes about your strength and willingness to work on things.\n\nThe betrayal runs so deep, especially knowing your history with your dad. It's like he deliberately targeted your most vulnerable spot. And to flip it around and accuse *you* of cheating? That's classic projection, and it's absolutely infuriating.\n\nPlease, take all the time you need to heal. You deserve to grieve this loss, to feel every ounce of anger and hurt. Don't let anyone rush you. You've been through a trauma, and your emotional well-being is the absolute priority right now.\n\nYou are not alone. So many of us have been there, and we understand. Your instincts were right, and you are not crazy. You are strong, and you will get through this. You deserve so much better.",

Narcissist always create a new version of themselves when their supply leaves. They like to create the exact version you wanted them to be so that you suffer when you\u2019re away from them and think why couldn\u2019t you do it for me?\n\nIf I could point to a moment, in your story where I would say emotional abuse started is when he watched you go to therapy to deal with your jealousy. He watched you pay for a doctors appointment you didn\u2019t need. I would also like to point out something in one of your posts here where you said that she was the ex of one of his friends. That makes him a bad friend too.\n\nI still don\u2019t think you\u2019ve seen this man\u2019s real face. I think he\u2019s a lot worse than you think that he is. I don\u2019t know if you understand the level of manipulation it takes to hide something like this. It\u2019s a lot and it\u2019s calculated and he made a conscious decision every day to look at you in the face and lie. That is 730 days he looked at you in your eyes and lied to you. With ease. And here\u2019s what I want you to understand the most he lied cheated emotionally abused you with zero remorse. If you didn\u2019t catch him, you would still be living this lie.",
