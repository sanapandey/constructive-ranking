    "selftext": "\nWell he broke up with me after 3 yrs(he said it was mutual but left me no other choice). It happened kinna sudden and out of the blue after a heated argument that we had (he said things that were really bad and he acknowledged that it hurts me deeply). After the argument I gave him a chance to explain what happen and we kinna conclude we had a lot of conflict that builds up due to miscommunication. But mainly I told him about why I was so hurt and keep seeking reassurance from him in the relationship (he says this make him question his love for me) bc his actions don\u2019t align with his words. Told me he loves me while actually out drinking instead of seeing me to communicate (he negotiates the meet up talk thing), lowkey led me on for the whole night waiting for him. \n\nAfter the conversation he realised that he lost his identity in the relationship not bc of me but bc he has been so insecure and not being the man he wants to be (having no job for the past 5 months). He said he need space to work on himself and he said getting back tgt everything will not go back to normal and we better takes time apart to heal (which is kinna true but it still hurts me that we couldn\u2019t work it out tgt, but I also know deep down that what he said in the heated moment really degrade me as a human so literally i know when we get back tgt rn I would dwell on that). \n\nHe said he want to work on himself in order to make us work bc he was so ashamed of how he act. He ensured me that he has no interest in dating anyone else and just want to put focus on him to heal (from miscommunication in our relationship beside his struggle in doubting people stem prior to the relationship). He told me we need to move on and fall in love again if we meet and all of the what is meant to be is meant to be. Also told me to move on and if i meet someone better allow myself to love. He said he want that person to be him bc he still loves me alot but scare that he will hold me back if he promises anything. I know he loves me by the way he care for me when we saying goodbye, in his eyes. \n\nHe is an honest man except 1 time he lied bc he is afraid to hurt my feelings but in the end he acknowledges that he just overthinking that. \n\nHe is working on himself now and just got a job iam so happy for him. I want to move on as well since I realize in the relationship i often doubt his love maybe i was abit insecure. His mother also love me and ensure that he is working and gyming, no girls envoled.\n\nI just want to know if this is something that is legit or just a soft break up. Is men really want to work on himself in order to love their partners better? \nI quoted him \u2018 i love you and i hurt you and I don\u2019t want that anymore\u2019 \u2018he doesn\u2019t want to be the same hurt person that ended up hurting the one he loves\u2019 \u2018he want to have something to offer not just words when we r back tgt\n\nI am just confused bc its a break up not a break. He said a break might defeat the meaning of this break up is for him and me to heal to be better people and we can be healthier in the relationship not to get back. His mom also said he need to sort his life out to have something to offer to me in a year or so cause at the moment he has no career and not pursuing a degree. Got back to trade school after the break up) and iam final year of finishing my civil engineering degree. ",

Always see him as someone caring and loving and he has a big heart.

I\u2019d say skip the bs and just move on. Unless he can articulate why he has to drop the relationship to work on himself and how he couldn\u2019t do the same thing while staying exclusive and just taking some alone time, you should save yourself the time and end the relationship.\n\nYou also seem a little bit desperate if I\u2019m being honest.

            "body": "I was you 5 years ago, relationship and why they fall apart is not always black and white, it\u2019s not because he doesn\u2019t love you anymore, it\u2019s not because he doesn\u2019t care anymore and even if it\u2019s clich\u00e9 to say \u201cyou have to love yourself before loving someone/letting someone love you\u201d, it is true. If he finds himself lost, frustrated to a point he\u2019s saying hurtful things, he needs to work on himself and figure things out. He probably has already a lot of resentment, towards the relationship, towards himself. Sometimes we want to make the relationship work so much that we lose ourselves. \n\nYou both are young, sometimes you grow and you grow apart, but that doesn\u2019t mean feelings are gone. What he needs right now is to focus on himself but he also needs to be fair, he needs to let you go and find himself. No lingering hopes, just to each their path and if it does happen that you cross each other again then great, if not, it\u2019s also okay. He needs to treat this as a break up to be fair to you and so you can love on and not wait/hoping he will be back. \n\nClearly you both need to learn about boundaries, needs and wants in a relationship. How to be healthy. The more you grow, the older you get, you\u2019ll understand that love is not just a feeling, relationship can\u2019t sustain only based on love, they require two people being healthy, having feelings but also emotionally mature enough to face all the ups and downs. \n\nHe might lose you forever but he\u2019ll find himself, you might lose him but you\u2019ll find yourself too. Break up hurts but eventually you learn to prioritize yourself, as you should, you\u2019re the most important person in your own life. When you\u2019ll do that, you\u2019ll see that you lost a partner but you gained experience and grew from it. It doesn\u2019t have to be ugly, it can hurt, it can take time to heal but in the end, if you process the breakup in a healthy way, you\u2019ll find more for the next relationship. \n\nWe are only humans, communicate with him that you\u2019ll give him space to do his things but you need to treat it as a break up so it\u2019s fair to you and your feelings. Wish him well on his new journey, take time for yourself, heal, process everything and most importantly love yourself.",
