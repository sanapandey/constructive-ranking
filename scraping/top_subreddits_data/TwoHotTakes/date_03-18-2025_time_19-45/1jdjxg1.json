    "selftext": "Okay so a buddy of mine was getting married and had a bachelor party. We all met up at a pretty nice restaurant to begin the evening. I got stuck in traffic and I was there about 45 minutes late. They had all been sitting around drinking heavily and already had several rounds of expensive cocktails by the time I got there.\n\nThey had already ordered the food but it hadn't arrived. Since I was late I just ordered a small steak and one beer, my total was maybe 30 bucks. The bill comes and it's astronomical.  Then they all look around and say shall we split the check? They tally it up and it's like $180 a person.  I didn't even bring that much cash with me so I couldn't have paid an even share if I wanted to.  I mentioned that all I had was a steak and a beer and I put in 60 bucks. Everyone kind of side eyes me and I hear a couple people at the end of the table grumble about how cheap I am. I don't even really know those guys so I shrug it off.  \n\nLater in the evening, one of the guys I do know pretty well pulls me aside and tells me that it's my buddy's bachelor party and I should have chipped in my full share. That a couple of the other guys who I don't know are upset with me.  He suggests I pay for a couple of rounds at the nightclub we were at to make up for it. But I declined and said I paid for way more than I ate.  \n\nAm I in the wrong here? I mean I know it's my buddy's bachelor party and all but $180 for a steak and a beer?\n\nEDIT: everybody is s assuming I'm broke and only have $60 to my name.  This isn't the case, I make a decent living and could have covered the entire check no problem.  But I was running to late and didn't have a chance to stop and get cash.  I had $100 on me and I assumed I'd be fine for dinner.  When I saw they had been drinking several rounds of expensive alcohol before I even got there it just didn't seem right to ask me to pay the full amount.  I ordered a small steak and a beer because I thought the kitchen could make it quick and I'd be able to get my food with everyone else, which I did.  \n\nEDIT 2:  several have said it was rude of me to be late. I suppose it was but the restaurant was over an hour away from me and I had to work that day. I left an hour and 15 minutes before I was supposed to be there and GPS said it would take about an hour. But along the way traffic conditions changed and it took me 2 hours. I texted that I was going to be late, I'm not sure what else I could have done.\n\nEDIT 3: The party took place a few years ago, it was pre-pandemic. So those of you who think you can't get a 4oz steak dinner and a beer for what I paid, you have to remember how much more restaurants cost now.  The steak was $20 and the beer was $7. \n\n\n",

            "body": "Backup of the post's body: Okay so a buddy of mine was getting married and had a bachelor party. We all met up at a pretty nice restaurant to begin the evening. I got stuck in traffic and I was there about 45 minutes late. They had all been sitting around drinking heavily and already had several rounds of expensive cocktails by the time I got there.\n\nThey had already ordered the food but it hadn't arrived. Since I was late I just ordered a small steak and one beer, my total was maybe 30 bucks. The bill comes and it's astronomical.  Then they all look around and say shall we split the check? They tally it up and it's like $180 a person.  I didn't even bring that much cash with me so I couldn't have paid an even share if I wanted to.  I mentioned that all I had was a steak and a beer and I put in 60 bucks. Everyone kind of side eyes me and I hear a couple people at the end of the table grumble about how cheap I am. I don't even really know those guys so I shrug it off.  \n\nLater in the evening, one of the guys I do know pretty well pulls me aside and tells me that it's my buddy's bachelor party and I should have chipped in my full share. That a couple of the other guys who I don't know are upset with me.  He suggests I pay for a couple of rounds at the nightclub we were at to make up for it. But I declined and said I paid for way more than I ate.  \n\nAm I in the wrong here? I mean I know it's my buddy's bachelor party and all but $180 for a steak and a beer?\n\n\n\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If there were ten total friends, not including the bachelor then at $180 each that implies that the bill was $1800.\u00a0 The cost for each of the 10 people also cover the bachelors part of the meal, had he been included the cost per person would be $1800/11 or $163.63 per person.\u00a0 You kicked in $60 total so the $1740 still due is to be divided among the 9 friends, meaning each pays $193.33/person. Each person is now paying $13.33 more than they otherwise would have, or $13.33*9 = $120. Long story short, this is probably why they are pissed. They were counting on splitting the bill ten ways but because you didn't carry 1/10 of the load they each ended up paying more.\u00a0",
