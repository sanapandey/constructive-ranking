He would agree, then go right back to doing it. Not honoring our agreement, this lead to our fights, and they became physical at some point and he even blamed me for his actions. His family continues tell him it isn\u2019t his fault, and I doubt I\u2019ll ever get an apology for his behavior ",

In fact, one of the most dangerous times for a woman to leave an abusive relationship is when she\u2019s finally ready to leave. Statistically speaking, I believe the only situation that makes it more dire for the one enduring abuse is when she gets pregnant. The abuser automatically gains a sense of \u201clocked in\u201d control but also fights with feeling a sense of competition with the unborn child. Do NOT get pregnant. A lot of these people, with enough advanced warning, will do everything in their power to start a pregnancy so you feel like leaving is impossible. \n\nAbusers also have a cycle they adhere to. First they lure you in with an over-the-top honeymoon phase. Jewelry, fancy dinners, flowers. All of this is to distract you from who they really are and to how they are slowly isolating you from your core support system. Then, once you\u2019re alone and more vulnerable, they start showing their true colors. They mock you, they gaslight you, they cross every reasonable boundary you have set\u2026 when it finally reaches a boiling over point and you start maneuvering your way toward an exit, they relaunch the honeymoon cycle and rope you back in. \n\nThe age disparity here is also alarming and most definitely by design. This man\u2019s tricks stopped working on his peers so he found a younger person who would be easier for him to manipulate. Less love experience. Also still used to \u201cadults\u201d guiding your actions since you just entered adulthood. How quickly did you two get married? Likely it was a whirlwind pace so you wouldn\u2019t have time to figure out who he really was while it would have been easier to disengage with. \n\nPlease, OP, leave and don\u2019t look back. And stop telegraphing your next moves. Let your lawyers speak for you. Turn off your location on any apps that he can use to track you. Set up a private bank account and funnel any small amounts you can to endorse you leaving. Buy gift cards for grocery stores and other staple locations that you can do without raising his suspicions. You are a survivor. Start thinking like one.",

The ex helped raise that child as his own, treated that one better than his other 4, yes four, he was married with children at the time when he was messing with her at age 13!!   \n\n\nThey're still together, not remarried, he doesn't drink as much, the grown kids still hate him, the affair baby is so emotionally messed up, they all are, and they don't like her much either for staying with that abusive A.H!\n\n Here they are, him 76, her 66, in the same house, but never together.

Thank GOD I didn\u2019t marry him, but you\u2019re younger than I was when it happened to me, so please accept my advice along with all the grace and compassion I can offer.\n\n\nI understand why you married him. But I also understand why he married you, and your reasons were very different from his. He does not have good intentions. He does not have your best interests at heart. He doesn\u2019t respect you. \n\n\nLet me say that again: he does not respect you.\n\n\nHe is actively manipulating you. You are not safe. Please get somewhere safe immediately. Don\u2019t go home after work, or don\u2019t be there when he comes home from work. If you have to be there when he is, take a trusted person with you. Get your important documents and any sentimental items you can carry. He may hide or destroy them. He will beg and plead and threaten you to try to keep you from leaving, and once it becomes apparent that it\u2019s not working, he will get violent. That\u2019s not speculation, he absolutely WILL get violent. He has before, and he will again. It will only get worse, especially now.\n\n\nGet out of there, immediately, and take everything you NEED with you. File a police report if he does anything that warrants it, and file one for each instance of DV that has already occurred. Go back to get the rest of your things with a police escort. ONLY with a police escort.\n\n\nGo to a relative\u2019s home, a friend\u2019s home, or a women\u2019s shelter if he\u2019s already succeeded in isolating you from your support. Lock down your finances. Do not speak over the phone or face to face. Screenshot all of his text messages. If you have any shared expenses, start unraveling yourself from them. For example, if you\u2019re on his phone plan, get your own.\n\n\nFile for divorce. Yes, it\u2019s expensive. But it\u2019s much cheaper in the long run than staying with this man.\n\n\nNow that you\u2019ve given him advanced warning that you\u2019re filing (!!!) he will try to prevent you from leaving by any means necessary. Don\u2019t count on him staying at work all day. Get out now. And please update when you\u2019re safe.",

BUT the difference is I was already my own person when we cemented our relationship- I was 35. Not once has he EVER raised his voice at me. In the last six months in particular, we have not had a single argument- we communicate if we feel misunderstood or think we might have misunderstood. We talk it out if we come to a difference of opinion. We share every minute of every day and we have yet to have a lull in conversation. \n\nWhen I was 22, I dated women and men 10, 15, and many more years older. I learned those people seek out women who are barely legal because women their own age can see the fact that they\u2019re still children. \n\nIn a way, you were groomed. Your brain is still leaning hard on the hippocampus for decisions, and that clouds judgement with emotions that cannot be separated from logic. Honey, you\u2019re so young. You have one life. It took me 35 years to find a man who actually is a MAN and a partner and frankly the closest thing to a soulmate I believe exists. \n\n\nDon\u2019t let people tell you to stay.
