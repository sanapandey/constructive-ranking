    "selftext": "So I posted yesterday about my SIL neglecting a baby she was babysitting. I see a lot of people wanted to see an update after the babies mom shared a post to our SIL to the town. Well she shared it with really disturbing images of what the baby\u2019s bottom looked like- she also tagged me in it so anybody on my friends list would see it as well. My SIL is still fuming and believes I should have just kept my mouth shut, my other SIL has went from not believing me at all to defending her sister, husbands mother is still defending the behavior. My husband has made it known to his family if they are mad at ME then they are also mad at HIM! He\u2019s cut all contact with his sisters and mother. He told me he was really just waiting for a legitimate reason to cut them out of our lives and this was the right scenario. He doesn\u2019t want his kids raised around people who defend child abuse and child neglect. \n\nThe babies mother also filed a report with CPS and the police. She\u2019s hoping maybe she would get convicted cuz then with a negligence charge on her she definitely would never get a job working with children. I have filed a report for the egging of my house. We don\u2019t have any cameras so there\u2019s really no proof. The police in our county really let a lot of things go-so I\u2019m not holding my breath that anything will actually be done. I\u2019ve come to terms with this. I\u2019m sad my son won\u2019t have a close relationship with his cousins anymore but im hoping maybe with cps and cops involved they will take a look in her home and keep her accountable for taking care of her own son. My real friends and my family are 100% on my side. I guess this was a good thing. My SIL won\u2019t be trusted by anybody in this town to be anyone\u2019s babysitter. And it had weeded out all the bad people me and my husband shouldn\u2019t be close with anyways. Anybody who will defend a child abuser is not anybody we\u2019d want in our circle anyways. ",

It was horrific. Counted diapers in the bag, she hadn\u2019t been changed at all. She was wearing a clean one when I dropped her off. No, she didn\u2019t go back to that sitter. So it can happen in just a day. Her skin wasn\u2019t especially sensitive either. \n\nMy son also had a bite mark on his tummy that was scabbed over, no mention of it at all from the sitter. She came highly recommended from my church. This all happened within the first week. She also sent them outside with no coat in a snow storm in early march. It\u2019s a helpless feeling when you have to go to work at a fairly new job and find yourself with no sitter. Luckily I had a neighbor that was between jobs who watched them until I could find a center. Didn\u2019t know her that well at the time, but her little girl was always clean and happy. We ended up being good friends. A week or so later I came home from work and saw that first one\u2019s 2 year old riding a big wheel down a busy road three blocks from home. Yes, I called CPS. I don\u2019t know what happened after that except they didn\u2019t take the kids.",

Think about it. Say this chick brought that baby over to her sisters mid day - she would have had that baby for what ? 4 hours ? Not changing a baby for 4 hours doesn\u2019t cause blisters to form, swell, burst and bleed unless there\u2019s an allergic or chemical reaction happening.  It\u2019s possible they used a product that caused a chemical or allergic reaction - my dad once mistook mr clean wipes for baby wipes and that was a very very red sore little bum on his grandson. But even that was angry, red and swollen but didn\u2019t bleed. \n\nI\u2019ve seen one baby bum that could match what happened to this child, with a horrific rash that blistered and bled.  That child was terribly, terribly neglected by the mother and was quickly taken away from her. \n\nNormal healthy skin, even very sensitive skin would not act this aggressively from 4 hours of surface contact. No question sister is neglectful and should not be around children.  To leave a baby in that state is disgusting and inhuman.",

He was blistered up for about a week until it fully cleared and he no longer screamed when i changed his diaper. \n\nThe blisters / opening of them bled a tiny bit, not bloody gory, but enough to be like holy shit this girl is neglecting her child (had anyone else seen it).

I see a lot of people wanted to see an update after the babies mom shared a post to our SIL to the town. Well she shared it with really disturbing images of what the baby\u2019s bottom looked like- she also tagged me in it so anybody on my friends list would see it as well. My SIL is still fuming and believes I should have just kept my mouth shut, my other SIL has went from not believing me at all to defending her sister, husbands mother is still defending the behavior. My husband has made it known to his family if they are mad at ME then they are also mad at HIM! He\u2019s cut all contact with his sisters and mother. He told me he was really just waiting for a legitimate reason to cut them out of our lives and this was the right scenario. He doesn\u2019t want his kids raised around people who defend child abuse and child neglect. \n\nThe babies mother also filed a report with CPS and the police. She\u2019s hoping maybe she would get convicted cuz then with a negligence charge on her she definitely would never get a job working with children. I have filed a report for the egging of my house. We don\u2019t have any cameras so there\u2019s really no proof. The police in our county really let a lot of things go-so I\u2019m not holding my breath that anything will actually be done. I\u2019ve come to terms with this. I\u2019m sad my son won\u2019t have a close relationship with his cousins anymore but im hoping maybe with cps and cops involved they will take a look in her home and keep her accountable for taking care of her own son. My real friends and my family are 100% on my side. I guess this was a good thing. My SIL won\u2019t be trusted by anybody in this town to be anyone\u2019s babysitter. And it had weeded out all the bad people me and my husband shouldn\u2019t be close with anyways. Anybody who will defend a child abuser is not anybody we\u2019d want in our circle anyways. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
