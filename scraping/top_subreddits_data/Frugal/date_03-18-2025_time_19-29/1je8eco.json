Has anybody ever done the math on how much it costs to run a unit like that for that many hours?\n\nI live in Northern California and SMUD is my electricity provider.\n\nI pay about $0.1678 kWh in non-summer hours, and then in the summer it spikes dramatically. $0.2077 kWh (from noon to 5pm) and $0.3655 kWh (from 5 to 8pm Peak Hours).",

So, I'm looking for ways to lower my sodium consumption. One of my culprits, was cans of Rosarita Refried Beans. I would use a single can of Rosarita Beans for 3 meals of these beef/beans combo burritos that I was making. One can of Rosarita Refried Beans has a total of 1,645mg of Sodium. Divided by 3 its 548.3mg's of sodium. Problem is, I would also use two flour tortillas that have 240mg of sodium each. So that's another 480mg of sodium. Then, I'd use two slices of cheese, which is another 140mg of sodium. I'd also use 3 Del Taco Scorcho hot sauce packets. 60mg of sodium each, which is another 180mg.\n\nGrand total is 1,348.3mg of sodium for my little combo burrito lunch. \n\nOf course, there's also about 50 grams of cooked taco meat, which is ground beef that I'd buy and cook in a skillet, but I'd add this McCormick Taco Seasoning packet thing, which is also probably loaded to the gills in sodium.\n\nSo, I wouldn't be surprised if the total would almost balloon to our daily recommended allowance of sodium which is like 2300mg.\n\nAll for just one single meal, that wouldn't even fill me up all that much.\n\nBut, if I can eliminate a lot of the sodium coming from the refried beans, that would be huge.\n\nSo, I need to start using dried beans and making them myself.",

If you want to measure at device. There is kill-a-watt device that gives power consumption at device. \n\nHope this helps. You can plug in your power and such into online calculators to give you a cost. Some solar calculators will do the heavy calculator lifting for you. Then multiply for you price per kwh.\n\n\nEdit.
