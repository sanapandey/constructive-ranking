She has a lot of expensive wants (that she pays for herself), is very generous with her friends and is constantly running out of money and asking to borrow. We are trying to exemplify and teach her frugality, personal finance, etc. but also letting her make mistakes on her own. I am wondering what else we could do to help her learn. ",

I felt so behind any time I talked to any of my friends, who were already planning out having kids and talking about how they were already saving for retirement. \n\nI also had a stressful realization that I was really living paycheck to paycheck and that I couldn\u2019t handle any emergencies if I lost my job, which is an uncertainty I couldn\u2019t afford to ignore in this current economy and state of my country (USA). While we both make modest salaries, have a mortgage together, and definitely aren\u2019t flush with cash, my husband is much better at saving than I am. He\u2019s been there with me every step of the way as I learn to become more frugal and save money. Saving together (both together in a joint account and for our retirement accounts) is still a pretty early work in progress, but we\u2019re working on it. \n\nNot saying that everyone needs to learn the hard way, but sometimes the wake up call when you\u2019re in a little over your head is the most effective saving method.",

I am just now realizing how bad that is at age 26. Well I always knew but I was struggling with finances and used that as an outlet for getting my needs met. If that makes sense. I no longer borrow money from my father or partner. My biggest reasons for my spending were lack of money (I know that sounds contradictory but it's an emotional thing) and the fact that I was young and insecure. Maturing helps over time. Realizing I can't retire as quick as I want because I'm paying off my debt from 5 years ago. (5 more years to go). I would blow $200 on whatever and not have anything left. Now that I make decent, I want to actually save it or pay off debt. Food was an emotional thing for me and eating junk felt good. Cutting that out and eating simple meals helped. \n\nKnowledge of what debt can do to you if it gets too bad (homelessness, no retirement, etc) would have helped me a lot.",

I was also thought self restraint I guess that helps (usually not eating or just a little at other people's places, no asking for things, being bratty etc)\n\nmy cousins were raised differently and it shows.\n\ngenerosity is totally different I grew up in an environment were people were generous so yeah I have always shared and bought things for my friends or paid for others (which later was a problem when I changed environment because people would take advantage and not reciprocate but that's an other story)... if it will make the other person happy or if I can pay for it I will, but yeah like for me within reason .\n\nI guess also I was raised and also perhaps never cared for (my brother is a bit different from that regard) to not value or think of brands as superior, and more look at the product itself (so we had branded and non branded clothes but often had non branded yet good and lasting clothes despite being way cheaper)\n\nI was also raised in an envirnment where if you don't have the money don't buy it, like credit is seen as a bad thing \n\nhonestly I would not give her the habit of borrowing from you except if there is an emergency or something... later she will borrow from the bank. if she has no money left she has no money left... she will have to deal with it.\n\nalso maybe explain how the expensive wants especially if they are not used often can be avoided idk.\n\nmaybe I am a bad example because I was abroad, alone at 17 having to manage my budget , food (well there was supposed to be a canteen but it closed that year so yay me) clothes and everything and in case of emergency no one was around . yet it was not that hard because of how I was raised.

When first child came along, I decided to stay home with her (1-1/2 years after she was born, daycare issues with her being repeatedly bitten) and our HHI was cut by 53%, boy did I learn \"frugal\" fast. I'm currently 2 months from paying off a 0% interest card that was used for a home improvement, after that the only debt we have is the house.\n\nOur first kid is now the most frugal human I've ever met, LOL. She makes more than me and saves faster (she lives at home, on purpose, to save). She buys to support her MTB and stringed instrument habit, LOL, but she plans for purchases and maintenance and pays cash. I doubt she'll ever 'not' be frugal.\n\nHer little brother, though, has a part time engineering-related job while in college and super expensive hobbies (mountain biking - there's an expression \"get your kid into mountain biking, they'll never have money for drugs!\" - but what it means is they'll never have money to save.  He's now a bike mechanic and photographer / videographer. While he has side hustles that offset the bikes / cameras / drones, he spends 67-90% of what he earns any given month. I think he'll need a 'hit the wall' moment to become frugal.\n\nHe's about to be engaged, though, maybe needing to save for their own place will flip the switch.  Fingers crossed!",

I would have probably been homeless without them, I was pretty frugal even as an 18 year old given the circumstances bc I had to be. So yeah I guess some money earlier on plus basic knowledge about budgeting and investing all together could have made a difference",

Sounds like you're taking a hands off approach, but maybe a lesson or two will help.\n\n2. The other thing is to help her examine her motivations. Is this a work hard/play hard scenario? Like is she doing this because she deserves it because she works? Or is it a feeling rich scenario? Like she has her own money and they sky's the limit? There are other scenarios, too, but these are common ones. These are complex emotions that a teenager might have a hard time processing and working through. Learning to budget while having these emotions might be difficult, and I think addressing how she is feeling with her money might go much farther than simply teaching her how to budget using a spreadsheet.",
