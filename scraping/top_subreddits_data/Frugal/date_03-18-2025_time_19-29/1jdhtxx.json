    "selftext": "I current live with a good friend and save a decent amount of money per month having a roommate. Unfortunately, she is moving soon and I will have to figure out my living situation. I\u2019m so torn between saving money and living with other people (it would be randoms..) or sucking it up and living alone. I know I technically *could* afford to live alone, but I\u2019m not sure if it would be smart. \n\nIn regards to my finances, I live in a MCOL city, make ~$4000 per month (net), do not have a car payment, but have a fat $600 per month student loan payment. I currently pay $950 in rent and to live alone it would probably go up to $1,300-$1,400. I\u2019m very frugal with my groceries and don\u2019t eat out much (maybe 1-2x per month).\n\nI\u2019ve always been frugal but I\u2019m mid-late 20s and the idea of having to navigate another living with randos situation is stressing me out. But the idea of shelling out an extra $400-500 per month also stresses me out. \n\nAny advice or experiences would be greatly appreciated!",

I don't regret it at all, but the costs of moving, covering utilities on my own, etc. made it very stressful. That plus a couple veterinary emergencies put me in debt that I spent 3 years digging out of. (I'm in a very high COL city, so this sounds unlikely in your case.)\n\nI was OK with that vs the alternative, but if you have it in you at all to do one or two more years with roommates to really build a rainy day fund, I'd recommend it. But you should weigh the cost of roommate stress vs. financial stress.\n\nI didn't live alone until until my early 30s, in case that context is helpful.",

There's still a lot of weird stigma to being single/not co-habitating, but imo it's very silly and reminiscent of the idea of \"spinsterhood.\" There should be absolutely no shame in having roommates until you can gain more financial security on your own! Isn't that the ultimate goal of adulthood in these times? But that's way easier to say than to feel. Best of luck to you!\n\nEdit: substitute \"man-child\" for \"spinster\" if that fits more",

That's a good amount of monthly savings especially if you also contribute to a 401k/retirement account through your job (which you should if available). \nAgain, it is a personal choice. A lot of people are tired of the roommate situation as they near the end of their 20s and rather pay more money for privacy/freedom. Also, factor in your long term goals. Are you trying to save up for a house, pay off debt asap, etc. Best of luck with your decision.\n\nAlso, maybe try posting in a personal finance subreddit?",

To go with roommates potentially saves you that money, which could go towards any number of uses. \n\nThe question you need to answer is whether or not living alone for that year is worth $5400 to you. For clarity, it is perfectly reasonable for the answer to be that you find it worth the money to be alone, to forego the headache of finding/retaining/tolerating roommates. One decision is not objectively 'smarter' or morally superior, despite what society at large might have us believe.\n\nIf the hours of your life can be given a monetary value through labour, it is perfectly reasonable to assign a monetary value to the hours of your life spent at rest. We do that when we purchase a better mattress, or shell out for a day at the spa, a vacation, any other form of caring for ourselves and our happiness.\n\nAt the same time, making the sacrifice of a set time limit (like one year) to come away with a semi-fat stack to spend on whatever (including moving to a smaller/cheaper place of one's own) has its own set of rewards.\n\nThe decision is ultimately yours to make based on what you feel will work best for you.",

I think living with friends is great but tbh living with roommates that you don\u2019t know can cause so much stress imo.  I am pretty frugal and waited til I had at least 5 years of rent (in savings and investments) saved up before I decided to live alone and not with strangers anymore, but that\u2019s more because I have low risk tolerance.  Also, usually your income goes up every year or two but if you can find a rent stabilized apartment, your rent won\u2019t increase the same rate as the market does if you wait til your 30s to live alone.",

It wasn't always bad, but it's nice to truly have your own space and there is always a risk of getting a roommate you're not compatible with.  However, it's a wonderful way of lowering your cost of living and building up your savings quickly.  In those five years, with the split costs of roommates combined with plenty of overtime, I was able to build up enough for a down payment on a Condo.  I now have a mortgage instead of rent and am able to live alone in a good Condo downtown.  I love it and would find it hard to go back.  But I was able to reach this point in the first place by dealing with living with others for a time.\n\nSo, it's up to you and what you value.  Is having your own space worth that extra money to you?  Would having roommates for a while be worth it to build up your savings for the future?  I've had mixed experiences with roommates.  I had numerous different roommates come in and out of that place I lived for 5 years.  In the best situation, we were all friends and had frequent game and movie nights together.  In the worst situation, there was screaming, slamming doors, and eventually a tense house meeting.  Unless you vet them, you don't know which one you'll get.",
