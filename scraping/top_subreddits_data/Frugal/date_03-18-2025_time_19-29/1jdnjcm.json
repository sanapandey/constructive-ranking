    "selftext": "Ever since I bought a $40 heated blanket rather than heating up the whole of my house using electricity, I have saved a crazy amounts of money. I have gone from having usage of about 54 kWh a typical day to about 4kwh. My projected bill this month is about $38, down from $120 the previous month. Definitely one of my most solid  purchases, highly recommend for low density households.",

If the house is half way properly insulated, can absolutely get away with not running any additional heat overnight and still wake up to a room around 17 or 18C (low 60s F). This is assuming the previous day's daytime temps  / the sun was warm enough to warm up the house.~~  (Edit - I can't read but leaving this here anyway).",

There\u2019s no air for the heat to rise in (via convection). It just spreads via conduction from most warm to least warm. And your body transfers heat better than an insulating comforter, so most heat will transfer to your body. The big insulating quilt/comforter is keeping the heat inside your little sleeping capsule.\n\nIf you have the heating blanket as the outer layer and exposed to the cold air in the room, then yes, a lot of that heat is getting wasted both because heat will rise through the heavier cold air (even faster if there are additional air currents in the room from a fan or a draft). And the room being colder than your body, the blanket will be heating the cold air more than your body. But then you\u2019re definitely using the blanket wrong. So it\u2019s not really an inferior product to the mattress pad other than being less foolproof.\n\nEdit: oops. Rockheadrumple already basically said this, just more succinctly.",

Then I switched to one that was layers of different foams with the top layer memory - and it was toasty, got rid of that one real quick and got one that's still layered but top layer is silicone. Paired it with a cool foam pillow, a cooling mattress protector - and real pro tip - bamboo sheets. Glorious.\n\n> Fans.\n\nFans are a mixed  bag. It's absolutely critical to ventilate as much as you can and a fan helps move air through the house, especially in pockets that don't have a natural breezeway. BUT - they do absolutely nothing for humidity (if that's a factor where you live), and a stand-alone dehumidifier actually generates heat. So at some point you gotta throw in the towel and run AC.",
