    "selftext": "normally like to buy good quality electronics, I normally buy those second hand and mostly the top model of last year. Use for few years and sale. This way I have kind of always latest tech and don't pay more for that. So far it is working well for me. When it comes to laptops, there is so much confusion on which Windows laptop to choose and they all have their some problems. Which poses me huge risk, specifically after few years those will be worth nothing, whereas MacBook will still hold some resale value. My budget is around \u20ac1000-1300 in thisI can get really great specs (i7 1370OHX, RTX4060, 32GB RAM) windows laptop or last year M3 Air 8 or 16 GB RAM What you wil do in such case?",

Their laptops are a little on the pricier side, but every single component is user replaceable. When you want an upgrade, instead of spending $1200 on a new laptop, you spend $600 on a new motherboard/cpu. It\u2019s savings in the long term.",

That comes at the cost of more visible wear and tear, consumer serviceability and upgradability. And for the amount of money a MacBook depreciates (while still maintaining a high resale value) you can but a windows laptop with amazing specs... And then install Linux on it. But if you're in a Mac environment, you're getting a mac. Outside of the self reinforcing ecosystem you get what you want. The work environment itself is the most important determining factor to getting a mac.\u00a0",

An aluminum Macbook will have some visible scuffs and fingerprints after a few years but I promise you it's gonna be a lot less visible than the wear and tear on a $300-500 plastic Windows laptop. And I don't think depreciation should come into this conversation at all, but I guarantee you a Mac will depreciate less. \n\nBut either way, I think we're drifting a bit from where this thread started. If you want an ultra repairable and serviceable laptop, just buy a Framework. They're a genuinely cool company doing great work, anything you buy from them is essentially infinitely repairable and upgradeable. You can get it sans-OS so you're not even paying for a Windows license you're not going to use if you just want to run Linux! I'd whole-heartedly recommend it if that's what you're after. Or--alternate suggestion, grab a used enterprise-grade laptop. I've got an HP Elitebook G4 that I picked up for $100 at a university surplus sale that's running Linux Mint these days, it's a solidly built computer that's decent enough for basic tasks.  \n\nBut if an acquaintance asked me the circumstances under which I'd recommend something like that to them are *very* narrow, because the people who are tech savvy enough to want something like that probably aren't asking gonna be asking around for advice. For just regular folks, if they ask me for what laptop to buy then 9 times out of 10 I'm going to point them to the base model Air. Why? Because it does all the day-to-day laptop stuff great: It's got better real-world battery life than almost anything out there, the processors are insanely quick for most workloads, the build quality is great, it'll last for years, there's a well-built out service network that I can point them to so I don't have to play tech support, and it's not going to ship with the pile of bloatware that your average Windows laptop does.",
