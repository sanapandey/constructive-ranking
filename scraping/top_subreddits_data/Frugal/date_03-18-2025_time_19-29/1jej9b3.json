Walmart has French bread for $1 per loaf, other stores maybe $2-$2.50 and then a jar of pizza sauce is about $2-3 and a bag of pizza/Italian blend/mozzarella is a couple bucks.   Can pick up some other toppings you like.  Each loaf feeds 2 adults especially if you make a cheap salad to go with it.  Each jar of sauce and bag of cheese does two loafs so figure ability to feed four for $10 if you buy a bag of salad to go with it (although cheaper to make your own).\n\nCan also change it up with different sauces and toppings.\n\n\nHonestly the key for us is bulking things with veggies.  Might make a baked ziti with a pound of ground turkey but add bell pepper, onion, tomatoes, zucchini, etc to stretch it and make left overs.  We always shoot to have left overs so we don't have to make lunch the next day and we're not tempted to eat out.\n\nI always like to eat fairly cheap.  You can make it taste just as good as expensive food, or better.",
