If anybody has suggestions on where to get better prices for this, please let me know! I'm sure lots of people are struggling with the same issue due to *gestures broadly at everything*. \n\nThis is something I need for my health, so I'd appreciate anyone who comments to be kind and respectful. Thanks in advance!",
