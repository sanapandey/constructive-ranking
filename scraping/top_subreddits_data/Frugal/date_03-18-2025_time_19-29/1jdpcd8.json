What do you buy and what do you avoid? What are your personal do\u2019s and don\u2019ts?\n\nI'd love to get some inspiration from you!\n\ni.e. our examples:\n\n* we only buy second-hand clothes (except underwear) and sell our own\u2014usually vintage items of better quality that last longer.\n* Whenever possible, we only buy what we can actually consume.\n* We also try to purchase discounted groceries close to their expiration dates and reduced-price fresh produce (ideally locally grown).\n* We freeze any excess food to avoid waste and avoid buying ultra-processed foods altogether.\n* We don't own an expensive car and try to use public transportation as much as possible.\n* For furniture, we only buy or obtain pre-owned items.\n* We also practice the \u201cbuy one, throw out two\u201d rule.\n* Another simple rule I personally follow is to \"sleep on it\"\u2014if I still feel like I need something the next day, then I consider buying it.\n* When dining out, we typically order the cheapest or second-cheapest wine, if any at all.\n* We only use reusable water bottles. Always and everywhere (also when we travel).\n* We don't use disposable razors (if, then we use trimmer instead).",

            "body": "Most of our furniture is from family members who gave us what they don't need anymore. If someone offers furniture we know we need, we take it.  \n\nLearning how to sew is a big game changer.  I just repair my clothes until I can't anymore.  \n\nI know how to knit and crochet.  Most of our washcloths and hand towels are handknit.  A $2 skein of yarn gets me two washcloths.  \n\nI avoid buying anything marketed to women.  Hygiene products marketed to women are typically more expensive than products marketed to men.  Just the other day I was buying loofahs at WalMart.  The loofahs for men were $1.  The loofahs for women were $2.00.  \n\nI also switched to a menstrual cup.  $14 for something that lasts a couple of years vs buying pads/tampons every few months.  Not to mention less waste. \n\nTaking a car in for regular maintenance is a big thing.  Keeping the car running smoothly and being able to catch problems before they become big problems.  \n\nWe also do our own home repairs as much as possible.  \n\nFor seasonal decor, I wait until it goes on clearance.",

You read into their depraved business practices that basically amount to crimes against humanity and it's not even a question that I'll be hypervigilant for the rest of my life researching any brand they've gotten their hands on to avoid paying them another cent as best I can.  \n\nSo I guess my point is all of these tips and tricks kinda flow naturally from knowing your principles, which is kinda how frugality becomes a mindset rather than a strict set of rules to follow.",

Basically every time we can avoid buying something it feels like a win (especially if I can find a long-term or permanent replacement for things we buy). The biggest way to avoid impulsive purchases is to surround yourself with people who are also trying to avoid impulsive purchases. Find a community of people who value resourcefulness over consumption.\n\nFood waste:\nStarted composting, doesn't directly save money but keeps us aware of how much food were tossing and encourages us to eat at home and use up what we have and not over buy \n\nTrying to purchase more from bulk/refill bins. Not sure if this is saving money but it reduces packaging and impulse buys.\n\nLong term replacements:\nSilicone sponge instead of stinky replaceable sponges. My sister also grew some loofahs which are great in the kitchen.\n\nNo Ziploc bags. Use glass containers instead and save bags from bread, tortillas, etc just in case.\n\nSeconding what someone said above about replacing tampons with a menstrual cup.\n\nMetal razor replaced my disposables.\n\nReplaced paper towels with t-shirt rags for cleaning and cloth napkins (made from bedsheets)\n\n\nFixing things:\nSatisfaction of buying a part or tool instead of a new item that I can use for future repairs. \n\nSimple mends for replacing buttons, covering stains, or patching holes.\n\n\nAlternatives to shopping/buying:\nClothing swaps hosted by local nonprofit\n\nMeeting friends/peers at the library instead of coffeeshops \n\nVolunteering at festivals, conferences + events in exchange for attending\n\nHandmade gifts and cards",

For example, sure, that fleeting moment of buying something online and then opening that package is joyful, but it's more joyful to feel pride that I fixed the thing rather than replaced the thing.  As Mercury Stardust says, you're worth the time it takes to learn something new. I think this is really the key for me. Sometimes it is joyful to go to a michelin starred restaurant, but sometimes you're just going out to enjoy the company of your friend or family and ordering frugally won't impact your time together. \n3. While I'm constrained by budget, I don't always let budget dictate my decisions. While I typically purchase the cheapest thing, sometimes something more expensive is worth it. I mean have you had really good pasta? The package is worth the $6 vs the $1 pack, depending on the occasion.",
