That's something to be proud of.\n\nDoes anyone else feel bad sometimes about it and get told oh they're boomers or this and that?\n\nI'm not a boomer btw I am 38!\n\nlike do I have to apologize for doing whatever it takes to make sure that I'm okay while you're living beyond your means?",

If OP bought a fixer-upper manufactured home for $8k ten years ago, that wasn\u2019t some good luck fairy granting a beautiful home. That home was probably kind of a shithole -no offense to OP with my description, but for $8k I imagine it was in rough shape. To me, it sounds like OP decided to live in a very undesirable home because it was cheap, and has spent the last ten years slowly improving it. That\u2019s playing the long game. And because it was in need of so much work, OP lives really frugally to be able to afford the maintenance and repairs. I\u2019m not gonna roll my eyes at that because OP has spent the last decade being smart and delaying gratification in favor of stability. That\u2019s hard.",

Your living circumstances are luck, and it sounds like you and I both got our homes before the big increase in the housing market.\n\nIf I were starting out today, there is nothing in the area where rent is below $800 even for a studio or one bedroom, and none of those are in walking distance of where I work.\n\nI don't have a car because I can't afford it, but I'm LUCKY enough to live within walking distance of where I work (about a mile, regardless of weather, from -20 to 120 degrees depending on the season, thus a two mile walk every day).  That isn't discipline, it's a combination of luck and I can't afford otherwise, and I have had times where I've instead had to cover taxi costs because of a broken leg in order to get to work.\n\nI don't watch TV, I don't have home internet. I go to the cafe or the library for internet (also within walking distance).\n\nI can only do it because I won the metaphorical location lottery at a time when home prices were cheaper. And my house isn't up to code, which was the only reason I could afford it at that time, over a decade ago.\n\nIf you're lording your discipline over people, I see what the problem is, because what you don't seem to realize is that you had incredible luck in finding your living circumstances, same as I have had.\n\nIt's a combination of factors and it isn't easy, it IS something to be proud of, but as far as just getting started today and being able to do it, or resetting one's life circumstances, it's all but impossible.  You and I have had basic circumstances that most people will never have access to, such as we have just isn't to be found anymore. At least no where safe.",

I framed it as not being worth the value of a couple grand per year to me plus the stupidity of devices with designed obsolescence that harvest your data at the additional cost of your privacy and you pay for the privilege.\u00a0 I've probably saved 25k in service fees and device costs over the years which then has grown in investments instead. Probably worth 40k now or close to it by rough estimate. No small chunk of change.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Some people also judged for driving my first car forever. It was 32 years old when it finally became unsafe due to structural rusting. Still ran fine though! Never had a car payment and insurance and registration was less than 300 a year.\u00a0 That let me budget more for repairs which was still cheap miles in the long run.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso judged for living with my folks for stints between big life changes.\u00a0 We got along, and benefits both financially, so wouldn't it be stupid not to?\u00a0\n\n\nNow I'm in a position where I've lost my job and have zero stress because I'm financially stable and don't need a job until I feel like finding another one. I wanted to give myself the option of being a stay at home parent someday and looks like I'll be able to do that at least for awhile if I want to.

It was a legit fear that Americans would stop doing things.  It scared us in a way that the domestic terror bombings in the 70s-90s didn't. When the markets reopened after 9/11 it was a massive sell off.  Tourism went way down because people were scared to fly.  It's the reason we still have the stupid security theater at airports. \n\nI understand it now but that was not the proper way to address that worry.",
