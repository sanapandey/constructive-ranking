I used to spend way too much constantly buying AA and AAA batteries, especially with remotes, controllers, and random gadgets around the house. Since switching to rechargeables, I\u2019ve barely spent anything on batteries in over two years, and they\u2019re still going strong.\n\nAlso switched to a water filter pitcher instead of buying bottled water, and I honestly don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t do it sooner.\n\nWhat\u2019s something simple like that which ended up saving you more money than you expected? Always looking for more frugal ideas!",

This is super helpful if you have women using it. \n\nThe installation is simple and it lifts up for easy cleaning access. \n\nI believe the 320 or 320 Plus models from the same company has a hot water option, if desired. \n\nWe waited until they went on sale on Amazon and got them for around $30-$35 USD. Funny enough, I saw someone just a few nights ago selling these ones live on Tik Tok!",

The sodastream machine itself regulates the pressure.  Also, don't buy a tank.  Most places don't want to fill your own tank while you wait, and even then, the tanks are only good for so many years before they will be past their certified date, and then the gas store will refuse to fill it.  Just get one of the ugly ones from the gas store, and find a way to stick it in a cabinet with the cable coming out.\n\nEach tank exchange is about $40.  Each full tank lasts me somewhere between 9 months and a year, and I do probably 1 or 2 of the liter bottles per day.\n\nGiven that the sodastream bottles are between $15 and $20, and last maybe a few weeks or a month, it should pay itself off within a year.

I have cut down my haircuts from every six weeks, to three times a year, with him trimming my hair in between. \n\nGranted, I have easy hair to trim, but between the two of us doing this we saved $625 dollars last year on haircuts alone.

This year, my heating bill (electric) ranged from $48 to $79 per month, which is a wee bit lower than last year).\n\nMy Oster bread machine, which I picked up for $10 about 8 years ago used at a thrift store, to replace my prior Oster (also used from a thrift store) that died after \\~20 years of use 2-3 times a week.  I estimate baking my own bread has saved me $300-$450 a year.  \n\nI also made myself reusable paper towels out of old washcloths and t-shirts, cut and sew them together, t-shirt fabric on one side, towel/washcloth fabric on the other side.

I use a hario v60 with paper filters. It takes a little longer to brew, but you save a lot of time and energy on the cleanup being able to just throw away or compost the grounds and filter. You can use a reusable filter if you prefer, they are still easier to clean than a french press, but for me the minimal cost of the filter is worth the easier cleanup.",

Early in the process I discovered the  D and C adapters who scored even more savings.  \nThey say ENELOOP batteries can be recharged up to 2000 times, but my experience has been much higher with a more sophisticated charger.    \nIt hurts a little up front, but the savings in the long term is quite amazing.",
