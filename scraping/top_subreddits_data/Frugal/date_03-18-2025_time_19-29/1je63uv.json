    "selftext": "Fell odd posting this but really having a struggle with this one, the mind and heart are battling haha.  I watched a documentary about how the majority of recycling just ends up right back in the trash, we all hear the rumors but apparently its more true than we want to believe.  I am paying $400 a year for curbside recycling pickup thinking I am doing good for the world but in reality it does very little, so why am I paying it?  Is canceling your recycling service a step to far to be frugal? My mind is telling me this is such a waste now, but my heart is telling me even if recycling system isn't prefect its better than nothing..  ",

            "body": "I've had my suspicions too.  My local rural recycling system accepts all numbers of plastic like 1-8.  My friend in a larger city thought this was odd since his fancy recycling center only does a few numbers.  I'm also torn on how much I need to clean the containers before recycling them.  Like is everybody using three gallons of hot water at the kitchen tap to clean out a peanut butter jar?",

Metal and glass recycling don\u2019t need the peanut butter jar perfectly clean (because it\u2019s not just water, but dish soap too!) the temperature for those recycling processes can handle it. But various plastics need specific temperatures and it needs to be much cleaner.\n\nBut also, I\u2019ve noticed smaller recycling can accept more types. Because the volume allows for hand sorting.",

They had to stop the machine and a guy used one of those grabbers like old people use to reach in and snag it. They said it'd have bounced around all day and knocked other stuff into the wrong place. It was too heavy to bounce into the right bin but too light to end up in the glass.",

The one we went to used several different techniques to sort stuff.\n\nThe peanut butter jar was stuck right at the beginning where paper gets sorted out. There were these, for lack of a better word, feet on wheels that carried plastic/glass/metal containers up but allowed cardboard to fall through.\n\nGlass and plastic were separated by the computer somehow recognizing the different materials and redirecting plastic with a jet of air.\n\nMetal is easy, ferrous metal got snagged by a magnet, everything else jumped off from a eddy current.\n\nPlastic was finally sorted into different types by hand but I'm given to understand a bunch of different companies are working hard to figure out how to automate that...",

If the facility isn't run by your local government(s) the answer is basically you don't without having to do some investigative journalism.  There can be some red flags though. If they accept all types of plastic in a wide variety of forms then odds are high that it's contracted out to someone who is either just dumping it into a landfill or putting it on a barge. If they are more selective about the types and forms that the plastic comes in they might be actually recycling the plastics in question. \n\nMetals/glass/cardboard are significantly more likely to actually get recycled than plastics as there is actual profits in recycling those materials and recycling them is significantly easier and more profitable than plastics recycling. \n\nIf it is run by your local government the info should be available and if it isn't the issue can be forced via a FOIA or similar government transparency request. If they don't honor the FOIA request, then you'll either need to get in touch with a lawyer or give your local news media a call. \n\nIn my area for example the county government runs the local recycling facility and is transparent about what happens to our recycling. They also only accept a couple of plastic types and don't accept any oddly shaped plastics. Plastic jugs, jars and bottles are accepted but not cups/bags/Tupperware.\n\nIf it's only privately run and there isn't any transparency available, and you genuinely care about the issue id recommend calling your local government representatives and asking they take action. Getting involved in politics at the local level is the most impactful  thing you can do as far as the government's influence on your life and on our impact on the environment.

It's similar to how rosin added to solder makes it melt easier. If you exceed a certain ratio of recycled glass to silica/lime/soda, you actually make the process less efficient and that is counter-productive to the goal of increasing efficiency through recycling the glass. That means it's not always cost effective to do so. It depends on local demand and shipping is expensive. \n\nIn many cases, if the glass can be used at all, it is better off being upcycled to something like fine grit additive for reflective paint or as an ingredient in pavers.",

Tldr, processing recyclables correctly takes time and effort that not every company is willing to put in. However, if they do put in the work, it has the potential to be hugely beneficial. She seemed a bit fed up with the idea that we should just give up on recycling plastic altogether, because it can be done if the effort is put in. Personally, I don't want to let the perfect be the enemy of the good, but I also don't have to pay to get rid of my recycling. Are there any options in your area to bring your recycling directly to the waste management company rather than pay for pick up? And do you have space in your life to reduce your use of plastics so that there's less waste to worry about?",

            "body": "I work in the business. I'm not a made for TV documentarian. A few things:\n\n1. The truck picks up trash and recycling and dumps into the same body - there are split body truck models. One side is trash, and the other is recycling. The driver can manually switch the stream load into whatever side.\n\n2. Even if your recycling is \"free\" or included in your service, it's not free. All recycling costs for fuel, truck, insurance, drivers, insurance, etc is rolled into the garbage pricing. That includes municipality services.\n\n3. Once the recycling is collected, it is hauled to a \"MRF\" (Material Recycling Facility).  Called a \"Murf\". While in there, workers and automation separate the materials that command prices on the market for sale. \n\n4. What gets recycled? Anything that can be sold (it requires capital to create the facilities, logistics, and pay for the manpower to actually make it all work). Since China basically closed up shop to foreign recycling streams a gew years ago, most plastics are not recycled as it depends on the price of oil. Oil makes plastic. If the price point of oil is low, recycled plastics don't exist. If the price of oil is high, recycling may happen, but since there is such a huge stream of it, and since Chinese recyclers closed up to foreign streams, there are few enough recyclers to take it. Some in India, other parts of the emerging market scene, etc. But yeah, basically, the plastic is trashed. There are always markets for metals, though. And sometimes cardboard (counterintuitively, those prices depend on supply, so you can bet that after Christmas, the recycling stream is overfull and the cardboard prices drop to the bottom so a lot of it is trashed). Going back to metals, copper, and aluminum are huge recycling markets, I imagine, especially now with tariffs in place that the market will be on fire for them.\n\n5. Don't blame the trash company. They are not a government that can print money to magically pay to create the recycling infrastructure. They need a market, which then incentivises the recycling stream that is picked up versus what is trashed. Some companies have just opted to cut out the recycling (going back to the times before \"0 sort\" services), and all trash is buried in your local landfill. Others, usually the giant ones who suck up all the small operators, have the capital buffers to keep portions of the recycling infrastructure in place, but it only can pay for itself if the materials thrown out are actually PURCHASED IN ORDER TO BE RECYCLED. If there is no market, it remains as trash.\n\n6. Don't blame the company for the trash. Blame yourself, your neighbor, your town, your hospital (which creates VAST amounts of waste, like unbelievable amounts), your state government (also creates vast amounts but then also usually just stiffs paying the company for the work). On up to the top. Blame the companies that package kids toys, our food, our goodies, etc for getting rid of metal and glass containers (but if they did keep those, we all would pay a lot more for our products just because of packaging costs). \n\n7. Trash companies aren't villains. They create a lot of good paying jobs. Mine gives me free healthcare for my family. It's a good match on my 401k, etc. It employs a ton of people. And we take a ton of abuse from the driver being accosted while on their routes, to absolute nutbags calling in because they overfilled their cans and even the truck hydraulics cant budge it, to state governments stiffing us on payments for services already rendered at their public auctioned-lowest price possible service to haul all their shit away so they don't have to look like the slobs they are. There are times I wish we would all shut down for 2 weeks, every operator in the country, and see what the country would do. But we won't, we'll take your shit, and your neighbors, and even your lame ass local government buildings, and keep it going into the landfill nobody wants by their houses, but are happy to think that once the garbage truck hauls it away that it magically gets snugged out of existence.\n\nThat is all.",

            "body": "I would suggest reaching out to your local municipality or your state\u2019s solid waste management division and asking about where your recycling goes. From there you can find out more about the facility or reach out to the facility to ask about how they sort and market recyclables. In addition, some states require that these facilities submit annual reports every year documenting how much they receive, how much is recovered (baled and sold), and how much residue they have (how much does to disposal like at a landfill). These reports may be available to the public.\n\nIn my state, these facilities can only have 15% residue, and I would say the bulk of the facilities are meeting that. \n\nIt is true that many plastics do not have a good market for recycling, such as 3-7. 4 and 5 have a limited market. 1 and 2s are pretty readily recycled. \n\nOften times when the statistic of \u201conly 11% of materials are recycled\u201d or \u201conly 9% of plastic produced is recycled\u201d is referenced that\u2019s including all sorts of materials that you would never put in your recycling bin or are not easily recycled, such as mixed material items. Many things we consume cannot be recycled. And even things that could be recycled aren\u2019t easily recycled. While statistics like that tell part of the story, I think the more important statistics are things about how much material that makes it to a recycling facility gets recycled. At least in my state, that\u2019s around 85%. \n\nIn regards to facilities accepting all types of plastic, often times that\u2019s for simplicity for the consumer, as well as maintaining habits. It\u2019s easier to tell people to put everything in the bin than to limit the accepted items  or change what\u2019s accepted with the market. As far as plastics go, the majority are 1, 2, 4, and 5. 3(PVC) and 6(styrofoam) are not common in the recycling bin to begin with. I would think that most people know now to put styrofoam in the recycling bin anyways.\n\nIf you have the option in your area, you might be able to take your recyclables to a transfer station directly to save money. The products from a transfer station are often times a cleaner stream than single stream materials that go to a MRF because it is being sorted right then rather than dumped all together on a tipping floor and sorted by machines and conveyor belts. This is especially important for glass which becomes very contaminated at a MRF but can be a clean marketable product from a transfer station. They are also often run by local municipalities so any profits go to them rather than a business. But a municipality may have a harder time marketing the materials since they are more limited to nearby facilities that will buy the product.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of education we can do to improve recycling (don\u2019t put that plastic bag in there!) but it is far from a lost cause. Reduce what you consume, buy less plastic items, and reuse, recycle, or compost what you can.",

For the rest, try to buy less packaging/fewer packaged items, and make choices to buy canned items or compostable/sustainable packaging. As to whether you need the curbside service, that is up to you. You could save your money and take it to the recycling center yourself. I did that for years when we didn't have curbside.",

There is only 2 of us. The recycling bin is rarely full. Yard waste is just me trying to catch up on yard work.\u00a0 Can't really burn anymore. It kind of feels wrong to call and say take my recycling service away",

Maybe just keep some bins and when they get full you can take them to the recycling center yourself. It's not as convenient but it will save you money and you will still be trying to be eco-friendly at least.",
