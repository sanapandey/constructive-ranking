But the quality has gone down in recent years like many other brands. I bought my current pair in September 2024 and they\u2019re already starting to fall apart. I want a brand that will last me years so I don\u2019t have to keep buying new shoes so often",

                            "body": "I agree completely with alternating shoes. I also recommend buying the best shoes you can afford. They are worth it because they protect your feet, which you cannot replace. As for athletic shoes such as Converse, when you feel the footbed collapse you will need to replace them. There is simply no way to avoid it. If you want to step up a level, buy full leather upper and sole shoes or boots and find a good cobbler to replace your heels. You still need to alternate good leather shoes because they dry out on the day you don't wear them. Get one in brown and one in black to match different clothes. Go up a size and use a gel insole to improve comfort or add support where the bare shoes/boots don't have it.",

I found that I can extend the life of my shoes and boots by using the replacement insoles. I sometimes have to replace the insoles every 6 months sometimes it takes longer.  My shoes and boots last a lot longer and my feet, knees and hips feel better.  And i used to replace shoes when.  \n\nThese days, I usually buy Keen boots and shoes.  I I usually get a couple years out of them and I work outside all day on our small farm in all kinds of weather.  I have a pair of their work boots Keen Cincinnati's that are 4 years old and just now developed a crack and aren't water proof anymore.  However, they are still fine to wear in dry weather.",

I asked for directions to the shoe department and he replied that he specializes in shoes. I told him I was looking for a pair of everyday shoes that would provide traction on packed snow, could be worn to the office with a blazer and slacks but could also be easily cleaned after walking on a dirt trail and around a construction site.\n\nHe showed me several brands but the Lowa (German) low cut stood out. The uppers are leather and the soles are Vibram. They were $200 in 2016, but today they look like I purchased them last month (2025). They\u2019re sold by REI now.\n\nI do change into my horseback riding boots daily when I go to the stable to turn the horses out and tend to their feed, water and hay.\n\nI also have a pair of Italian hiking boots I bought around 1977. I\u2019ve worn them on several treks in the Rockies, the longest being 14 days, too many treks to count in the Appalachians, the Cascades, the Alps, the Juliann Alps, Norway and Sweden. I pack them on almost every business trip when there is a chance I\u2019ll have a free weekend day.\n\nDon\u2019t skimp on footwear, especially if you travel often. Since you\u2019re a college student, I\u2019d recommend you keep an eye out for sales and buy a good quality pair that fits your needs. You can still keep a pair similar to Converse for horsing around, just don\u2019t expect them to last long. If you need a pair for a sport or exercise (running, tennis, squash, weightlifting, etc.) purchase a pair designed for that purpose - they\u2019ll last longer and possibly improve your performance and enjoyment of the sport. Good luck.",

I've resoled at least two pairs of them.  I've used their work boots for hiking.  I used to be on my feet most of every day walking on concrete floors or CVT (Commercial Vinyl Tiles) covered floors which are basically as hard.  My feet were never sore when I wore my Red Wings.\n\nHowever, they are not sub-$100 boots/shoes.  You're going to spend $200-$400, but the uppers will last for a decade, and the soles will last as long depending upon where you're walking and the type of sole you choose.\n\nBut they are SO worth it.",

However, you can go into a retail store and find which line fits you properly for the way you walk and roll your feet (pronation). Once you know which style and size fit, you can often find last year or year before left overs on Amazon for way cheaper. \n\nMy newest pair I got about a month ago were the 23 model and they were I think $80 on Amazon from a third party seller. You\u2019ll know what year they\u2019re from because it will have it in the name (ie ghost 23). You\u2019ll have less options for colors in your size, but you can still find some nice looking shoes.
