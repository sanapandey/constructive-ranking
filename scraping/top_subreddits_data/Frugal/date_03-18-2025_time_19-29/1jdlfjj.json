I bought a full spring mattress off of Amazon 2 years ago and it is shot, sink hole in the middle. I'm 5' 10\" 200 lbs. Wondering about the longevity of the Zinus brand. I have a limited budget so need to stay in the Zinus price range. Thanks.",

All of my linens, bedding,\u00a0pillows, couch, and most of my clothes.\u00a0\n\n100% not worth the risk.\u00a0\n\nI bought a Sunrising 8\u201d Natural Latex mattress off Amazon for like $450? Five years ago. Still sleeps like new, although I have used a couple different mattress toppers (I had an all natural one for while I was pregnant and bed sharing with my baby from 4 months to about 2 years, then I switched to a \u201cnormal\u201d foam mattress topper from LinenSpa for like $80 maybe). This second combo is the most comfortable sleeping system I\u2019ve ever had. The mattress topper is 2+ years old and still works perfectly, no sagging or anything.\u00a0",

My husband and I both wanted a firm mattress due to back problems, and I was afraid any memory foam or \"bed in a box\" options wouldn't be firm enough. But the one we got was designed to be similar to a traditional innerspring and turned out to be very firm, exactly what we were hoping for. I don't think it ever expanded to the full 10 inches, but it did expand very evenly without any sunken spots. I don't know that I would expect it to last more than 4-6 years, but thats mostly based on how cheap it is, and the fact that it isn't designed to be flippable for even wear.\n\nBut based solely off of sleeping on one for 2 months, I'd recommend giving it a shot.",
