    "selftext": "As a diabetic, I eat keto so I buy a lot of heavy whip from Costco. I primarily use it for my coffee but also for keto baked goods too.  It\u2019s pretty expensive but it lasts me a long time. This month I decided to visit a food bank to take a little off my grocery bill because my hubby is changing jobs. To my surprise, I got a big Costco carton of heavy whip! Unfortunately the best by date was two days ago and I had just purchased a carton last week\u2026 what to do with all this heavy whip?? I know, make delicious homemade butter! I usually avoid doing this because it\u2019s just cheaper to buy butter in terms of ounces I use, but this worked out great! I\u2019ve also been preserving fruits and veggies. I get from the food bank as well because there\u2019s just no way I can eat them before they go. Food from the food bank is usually already on its way out sadly.",

I did this while wearing a $100 pair of shoes on my feet, the same shoes I walked home in because I couldn't afford bus fare and had no car. Shoes were purchased when things were better in my life, and I was very lucky to have them because walking miles requires good footwear. Things are much better now for me now financially and I am so grateful.\n\nIf you are judging someone because they have a mixer, shame on you. Maybe spend less time judging about situations you know nothing about, and spend more time helping in your community. Lots of people out there struggling and need help.",
