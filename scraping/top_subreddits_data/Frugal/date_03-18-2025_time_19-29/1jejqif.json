    "selftext": "I'm having trouble finding a sort of donation center that will accept well-worn shoes. I have like a hundred pairs of decently well-worn shoes accumulated over like two decades. These shoes range from rarely worn (but like twenty years old), to kind of battered but still usable for those who really need it, to kind-of-worn but totally reusable second hand. So, none of them are \"like new\" or \"gently used\", which is what I've found all these donation centers require, like shoe recycling programs or local churches.\n\nI can't for the life of me find an \"in-between\" for these kinds of places that require \"like new\"/\"gently used\" shoes vs. just throwing it in the trash and these shoes ending up in a landfill. I think all of these shoes can either be used second handed or refurbished for a second life to someone who really needs them.\n\nAnd I really want to actually donate them, not just give them to someone else like Goodwill to sell for profit.\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions?",

My point is these are all shoes that can at least be in part reused and I really want to find a way to donate to someone who has use for them rather than sending them to a landfill. Just having trouble finding how to find that \"someone who has use for them\"...",

Non smoking, cleanly home, no pets.  Think it was Catholic Charities that inspected it and declined to accept unless she purchase a \"sofa cover\" to donate with it.  Said their clientele would not accept as the couch wasn't stylish enough.  Apparently Baby items have little resale value. My neighborhood puts highchairs, strollers, and other used but in good shape baby items at the curb for trash pickup. If still there the days of trash pick up, do cleaning sanitizing, and take them to a charity shop. Clothing and shoes have very little resale value.  You could offer on Buy Nothing pages.  Free Facebook Marketplace.",
