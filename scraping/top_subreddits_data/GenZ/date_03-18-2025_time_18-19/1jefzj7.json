                                            "body": "I think it's more that this phenomenon has basically nothing to do with how people pass genes on through reproduction and instead is a product of economic disparity and the propaganda of an entirely privatized information ecosystem. Which could still be an astute observation, except that in the movie \"Idiocracy,\" the dumbing down of society is rather explicitly attributed to \"stupid\" people outbreeding \"smart\" people, as though either of those descriptors were a matter of genetic lottery for the vast majority of people. Don't get me wrong, people *can* be born with genetic conditions that impair their brain capacity, but that affects a very small minority of people, who themselves tend to reproduce at a lower rate than average, and who in no way have any culpability in the actual threats to intellectual pursuits posed in our modern society.\n\nThe reason people might *appear* to come from a lineage that is \"smart\" or \"stupid\" is usually one of economic privilege or lackthereof, ie, generational wealth in polarization with cycles of poverty that are difficult to escape. If someone comes off as genuinely stupid, it's not typically their own fault and we should hesitate to express any anger at them on account of it. Most of the opportunities people are afforded to broaden their thinking skills are presented during their formative years, both in and out of their education system. These are circumstances that children have no control over, and it is demonstrable that the greatest factor in the quality of this development is the socioeconomic status of their families. \n\nPoorer families have parents working longer hours during times in which their children would benefit from engagement with them, including sometimes needed outside assistance with academic responsibilities. There's a decent chance that if these families are impoverished, the parents themselves would have also been at an educational disadvantage, leaving their children with less educational value to be able to observe from them. It's also pretty hard to concentrate on school as a child when you're hungry and stressed about the probability of your next. Or when a parent who is overworked and stressed to a breaking point lashes out at you and misunderstands your adolescent impulses, which can also be shown to stunt the development of those reprimanded children directly. Oh, and the school that you attend, on which the burden of rearing you is practically relegated, is likely severely underfunded, often due to so many public schools being unequally powered by local property tax levies. In other words, poorer neighborhood means lower property values means less school funding.\n\nThat school funding from property tax is of course the opposite for kids in rich neighborhoods. Assuming those with rich parents even go to public school and not wealthy and privately funded institutions. They also tend to have access to extracurriculars like music lessons and sports, which have a very directly positive impact on their brain development. Some have private tutors. And for those times when they're not at school or soccer practice, they tend to be able to get more attention from their parents, who likely are also well-educated. Maybe that even earns their children a legacy admission to their same Ivy League University. Wherever they end up going, they are less likely to end up needing to work a job or two while in high school or college. The disparity is grim.\n\nHow \"smart\" you are in most circumstances has fuck all to do with your biology and everything to do with your level of economic privilege. The good news is that we have gradually tried to build more safety nets to assure that successive generations of children are able to bridge this gap and hopefully inhabit a more egalitarian future. Things like scholarships, advancing curriculum, better childcare and parental leave, FAFSA, funding from the Department of Educa - oh wait. God damnit. The current political climate in the US is evidence that as wealth inequality continues to skyrocket, those on top are starting to see the writings on the wall of unrest amongst an increasingly educated yet still downtrodden population. This was part of why Reagan got rid of free college in the state of California when he was governor (that and curbing anti-war activism. Sound familiar?). It's now part of why these oligarchs who flaunt their own supposed genius want to pull the ladder out from below them. Because they know damn well how this works. And they want more uneducated factory workers.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Mike Judge has ordinarily been a comedic genius. And much of the standalone satire in \"Idiocracy\" is pretty decent. But as a whole, I find it to be an absolutely *terrible* movie, if for no other reason than its attempts at highlighting a very real problem and attributing it to very dangerously untrue causes. Which in some ways is genuinely worse than simply ignoring the problem altogether.",

I live in a small town where a lot of people drink, smoke and gamble. I don't do any of those things because I been taught that it will make you feel horrible in the long term. I have seen people buy 300 dollars worth of lottery tickets because they think it guarantees more money. I can help to view these people the same way as the characters of Idiocracy. The dumb, but they are not irredeemable, however, I struggle to talk to them. There is also the religious and political stuff that applies to the same struggle. I do live Donald Trump country.",

(Didn\u2019t vote at all this or last election) I don\u2019t think this movie is even scientifically possible, but even if it was, society would collapse long before a scenario like this movie could happen. Meaning that intellectualism would return in order to pick up the pieces. That said, there are things we can learn from this film, like not letting corporations poison us or lobby government officials.",
