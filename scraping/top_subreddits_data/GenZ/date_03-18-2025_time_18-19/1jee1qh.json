I remember them trying to teach  me how to read them at like 5 ,6 ,7  and I though it was such a bother to learn compared to digital time so I swore il never look at them again as I though it was impossible learn as I didn\u2019t have the patience. Years later (I\u2019m not proud to say) at 19 yrs old, I thought to myself how come I never properly learned analog? After watching videos of older people or even people just 5 yrs older then me grill people like myself on how we can\u2019t, I sat down, watched one video and practiced for exactly 30 minutes and I aced it, it took 19 nearly 20 years just to spend 30 minutes to learn it.",
