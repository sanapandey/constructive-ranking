Sometimes it's nice to feel hopeful about things. Sometimes it's just kind of pathetic. Lol",

If you're monogamous and you're in a good relationship that you're happy with and love, it fades pretty quickly into a platonic friendship and is completely harmless.\n\nIf you're single just be patient with it and don't be afraid to pursue some of those crushes further, and also don't feel like you need to pursue them all. Just do what suits your life best and if you're 25 or younger trust that your brain still will develop and become better at managing those signals.",
