Because of A, B, and C that your generation has done, not done enough of, or hasn\u2019t done at all, the world is completely ruined. If you all were a little bit better at D and not so concerned with E, the world would be saved, but noooo, your selfishness couldn\u2019t allow that. So now, I, the wisest savior of all Reddit, have to come into this sub, to save you from your own stupidity. Insert scold, insert other scold, scolding scoldiest scold scold. Style scold. Pedantic scold. Esoteric scold. Virtue scold. \nThere, I win the internet. I, in all my glory, have solved Gen Z. Upvote me for my dopamine hit, plebeian swine. \n\n/s ",

Currently, I'm a writer for Washington Post, living in a small studio apartment, always looking for the next big story, barely scraping by sometimes. I was asked several months ago by my editor to do a piece on the so-called \u201cGenZ\u201d community on Reddit that seems to become more and more popular by the day.\n\nInitially, I was intrigued. The humor was bizarre, yet interesting. Nonsensical, yet genius. I spent several months interacting with people I had never met before in my life, learning the culture, what was \"cool\" and what wasn't. Eventually, I began to make my own posts, testing the waters now and then. And eventually my own posts started getting noticed, and maybe for a minute or two I understood why you all do this. But that didn't last long. And with time, I began to notice how stale the content truly was. How the same 'memes' could be spammed over and over again, and still get massive amounts of attention.\n\nAnd I also began to notice something else. The viciousness with which you attacked each other. The semi-constant bullying and harassment. Each day, it made me even more sickened than before, to the point where you people made me start questioning everything about reality and what I knew about it.\n\nI couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. I was drinking 2 bottles of milk every night. But, finally, my mission is complete.\n\nTomorrow, we will be publishing a comprehensive guide on this group, potentially exposing some of your members' most well kept secrets. I'm deactivating this account at midnight, but before I do, I just want to let you know you all make me sick.",
