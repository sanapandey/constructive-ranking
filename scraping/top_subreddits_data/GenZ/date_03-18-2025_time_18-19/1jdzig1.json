They also believe this process bred racism into the white race, and that all other races are off shoots of this \"bleaching\" process.\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally they believe some white people saw the error of their ways, and tried to return to being black, but have so far only manages to breed themselves to the point kf being gorillas. That's what they think gorillas are, white people re-evolving back to black.\n\n\nLike I said. Not a clever bunch.\u00a0",
