However, there were little to no restrictions on who could come in. The customs officers and the immigrants didn't even need to be able to communicate. \n\nEllis Island was notorious for having near 0 restrictions. A shit ton of people had their names misunderstood. My ancestors, for example, said they were from a town in Sicily. The customs officer misunderstood and thought the name of the town was actually my ancestors' last name. \n\nBut, it should be mentioned that illegal immigrants and legal immigrants alike don't get here for free either.\n\n>Newsflash: nothing in this country is free.\n\nFree speech is\n\nDue process is\n\nLiterally all but like 2-3 rights provided by the Constitution are free.\n\n>If you think it\u2019s all about just \u2018basic rights\u2019 without any cost, then you must\u2019ve skipped history class.\n\nAnd you seem to have skipped Civics.

But that's neither here nor there.\n\n>People have always had to pay to be here\u2026whether it\u2019s in taxes or living by the rules.\n\nIllegal immigrants pay taxes, they're less likely to \"break\" the rules by committing crimes (other than the original one by overstaying a visa or crossing borders illegally), and they're less of a drain on the government than citizens of equivalent socioeconomic and educational status.",
