But most of us are legal adults already.\n\n  \nThe moment you understand every person on this earth has different experiences that lead to different ideas and ways of behaving. You will start to grow up and become mature. Every person has individual lives, responsabilities, concerns and priorities. None owes you shit, every person has enough problems as it is.\n\nMany times what it seems a true problem is in fact, a lack of perspective on the matter. Easily solved by getting out of your head and putting yourself in the shoes of others.\n\nWhen you are in peace with this fact, you no longer take personally a woman that doesn\u00b4t answer you.\n\n  \nBut until then, you can continue arguing about women and complaining none listen to you. No, I will not pity you on your hate crimes towards women or any minority. Grow up.\n\n  \nFor me, it took 21 years to understand this, and I see you do the same thing. When you grow empathy and understanding on others, I will meet you in the group of the mature adults.",

Getting forced to remain in the house for nearly a year straight, and the only \u201csocial interactions\u201d people could have were online. Kids who were on social media, especially the ones who were too young for the TOS, grew up with this as the norm. Seeing the world through very curated, edited way causes a person to buy into quick reactions, instant gratification, and the problem of small attention spans. I blame the parents of these individuals for letting their kids rely on technology this much, but this is now a problem with young people who are on the way to becoming adults.",

And, while there is a psychological base to this, nobody likes to see themselves as the \"villian\". But, accepting that you can be wrong makes life a helluva lot easier, and problems actually get solved. People in this subreddit are very quick to point fingers, blame everyone else, and offer no solutions. Everyone also seems to want to place themselves as the victim, which is why everyone is pointing fingers. That also has a basis in psychology as we reward victims we feel as though life is better as a victim than not.",

Which again, is objectively false. I linked a timeline that discusses how people DID care about trans people existing and how politicians created laws that punish them for existing.\n\nThe vast majority of people know VERY little about trans people and most have never knowingly gotten to know a trans person. And frankly there are a lot of people who DO think trans people should be hunted in the streets. In fact, trans people are 4 times more likely to have violence committed against them than cis people (people whose gender expression matches the sex they are born with). The anti-trans bills written and passed in the United States completely contradict your statement that trans people have equal rights and protections under the law. \n\nHow about you come to this conversation with any receipts or facts to back up your position?

They're doing the same thing, and it's been tested doing this new thing just in case and it's safe.\n\n\n\nHere's the really crazy part of your comment though. You're completely wrong, which tells me you have no idea what you're talking about. Hormone blockers have been tried and tested on children and the effects are completely reversible. There are some negative possible effects, as there are with every single medication, but I must stress again that these effects are rare, and many of them are also reversible if you stop taking the treatment. You can undo the effects of pausing puberty. It happens a lot.\n\n\n\nAnother aspect of this issue you don't understand is how difficult it can be to get these treatments as a minor. There needs to be a long term accounting of gender nonconforming behavior, a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, and consent from the parents. This isn't something they just prescribe randomly. There are reasons for the prescription, as there are with any other drug.\n\n\n\nThe negative effects of hormone blockers are also inconsequential compared to the potential downsides of irreversible puberty in a transgender child. Gender affirming care reduces rates of suicide and depression. \n\n\n\nA lack of data is not uncommon for adolescent research as well. \"It\u2019s common not to have data from randomised controlled trials in paediatric care\u00a0more broadly. The use of puberty blockers for early puberty displays similar research gaps.\"\n\n\n\nLastly, these treatments have a regret rate of literally 1 percent. Knee surgery has a regret rate of 20 percent. Even if, as you say, the effects were completely irreversible, it would negatively effect 1 percent of people who take them. Comparatively, puberty negatively effects 99 percent of applicable individuals.\n\n  \n[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/in-depth/pubertal-blockers/art-20459075](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/in-depth/pubertal-blockers/art-20459075)\n\n\n\n[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9793415/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9793415/)\n\n\n\n[https://www.mcri.edu.au/news/insights-and-opinions/what-are-puberty-blockers](https://www.mcri.edu.au/news/insights-and-opinions/what-are-puberty-blockers)",

They are not wrong, but they are a hypocrite. Plus this same logic can easily be used against them to dismiss their own point.\n\n> Honestly, I think that a lot of people are rejecting this post bc the statements about \"arguing about women and complaining none listen to you\" directly calls out their insecurities, and this is causing a reaction of defense instead of interspection. That's why they immediately accuse the poster of making broad generalizations, when in fact that's just their perspective that they want to project on others. \n\nIt's very easy to dismiss any criticism or backlash as just someone being insecure instead of actually engaging with their argument and it's even easier to misrepresent them. It doesn't help that if the intention was to encourage introspection in the reader--\n\n>When you grow empathy and understanding on others, I will meet you in the group of the mature adults.\n\n> But until then, you can continue arguing about women and complaining none listen to you. No, I will not pity you on your hate crimes towards women or any minority. Grow up.\n\nSaying stuff like this ^ is a poor way to encourage introspection. It is easy interpreted as hostility and as an assumption about the reader which already puts them on the defensive. You shouldn't assume these things about your reader when entering a discussion. And even if you don't agree with that sentence, they blew it on their very first sentence:\n\n>This is going to piss you off so bad\n\nAre there people like this? Yes. Are there people acting like this who aren't aware? Yes. But while hostility can encourage introspection, it is the worst way to encourage it. That does not invalidate the importance of introspection, however. \n\n>I share the same sentiments as OP because I've been there: I thought that I knew more than anyone else and everyone's advice was wrong. I had to learn the hard way that people weren't generalizing me into a group just to insult me. They weren't generalizing at all. They just brought up an insecurity of mine and I projected it onto the other person, accusing them of making generalizations.\n\nYes and that's a valid realization, but if the goal was to encourage introspection in the reader...  \n\n>But until then, you can continue arguing about women and complaining none listen to you. No, I will not pity you on your hate crimes towards women or any minority. Grow up.\n\nSaying stuff like this ^ does not help as it actively discourages self-reflection by putting the reader on the defensive and as such, it can easily be interpreted differently.  It can also be interpreted that OP is narrowing it down talking to a specific group (In this case, men) instead of the general group of \"Gen Z\" as they claim. And if you want to argue that is a stretch, OP's posting history does not help with this either.\n\n\n>\u00a0No one with good intentions is going to steer anyone down the wrong path.\n\nThis is quite naive and it can easy be perspective based. Plus, it doesn't matter whether or not someone's intentions are good, even good people can still steer people down the wrong path because not all advice is good, some advice is flawed. The role of the individual is to interpret the advice they hear from people and to determine if it applies and what works for them and their situation.\n\n>What helped me was asking myself \"was this person trying to insult me, or was he telling me something that I don't want to hear?\"\n\nThose are not mutually exclusive arguments while also OP is able to simultaneously hide behind the latter.  One can feel insulted yet still find truth in a statement. OP can also claim they were trying to encourage introspection with good intentions and good faith, although there is a clear lot of bad faith here which leaves their message and intentions open to interpretation. While yes it can encourage people like you for example to be introspective, you are not everyone and this post fails at talking to a general audience due to its narrow wording and to how it tries to handle getting people to perform \"introspection.\"\n\n>And it turned out, I was rejecting a lot of advice that was hard for me to receive, but I needed to hear it. I wouldn't have been able to grow otherwise.\n\nNot wrong. However giving hard advice is not the only way to encourage growth and just because it is \"hard advice\" doesn't mean the messaging doesn't matter. How to get your advice interpreted matters more than the substance of the advice itself.\n\n>You gotta be willing to take a step back when you read posts like these and look at the bigger picture.\nThere are several interpretations one can make due to the OP's wording. The only one who has the big picture for this post is OP and even then, they can easily lie about their intentions when faced with backlash.\n\nIf the goal was introspection this is a poor way to encourage it. Introspection mostly comes from a place of open discussion, which again, is ironic in the context of OP's post. Sure, you can still claim it still does its job, but it does so very poorly to the point you can reasonably argue otherwise.",

Like unrestricted internet access alone, especially for elder gen z who may have seen straight up irl gore and other disturbing content like i did. then that + how we can't escape the news, all the historical events thats occurred. The pandemic alone caused signficiant trauma that I don't think people have assessed. \n\nI have trauma from shit in my life, and it's so easy to stay in that traumatized frame of thought. It's easy to feel hatred and anger and to want others to suffer because it's not fair that you did--those are normal emotions to feel when traumatized. it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy. You need to be the one to want to break the cycle of hurt and anger.\n\nShit will impact you more the younger you are, but you are more likely to bounce back closer to normal the younger you are. I rememeber how I felt, and I don't wish that kind of anger and self-loathing on others. It consumes you. The world is unfair and it sucks, but you can do something to make it better for someone else so that they don't have to suffer like you have.\n\nsorry for rambling as a reply, lmfao. I feel very strongly about this issue, and trauma has shaped my entire life. It sucks that sometimes you gotta be the one to fix yourself, and sometimes you have to do it alone.",

Not in the sense that we're *cough* slower on the uptake or something but I think the COVID lockdowns had a larger impact on social development than what most care to admit. \n\nI mean so many got locked out of a \"normal\" school life, and then in addition post secondary education due to the lack luster covid response, and the lockdowns that were going on for a better part of 3 years. I mean where I'm at the COVID response stayed in place for about a year after COVID ended meaning 4 years of masking, distancing, and constant pressure to isolate from the same institutions that are supposed to ensure proper development. That just CANNOT be healthy for developing impressionable minds like those who were going through highschool and early post-secondary education.\n\nAll I'm saying is the behavioural patterns we're noticing now are probably caused at least in part because of the aforementioned reasons. Additionally I'm sure the job market and availability for social interaction being rather scarce isn't helping the situation.\n\nEdit: as for the shit we've seen having access to *the internet* well, I don't know... I mean at this point I think we've all seen some sort of gore... Whether by choice, accident, or because of that one random dude who would go \"hey look at this\" and then show you the most horrendous video he found on the internet... My thoughts on it are relatively confusing, I think a large portion of the generation sees it as something unreal? Like seeing it through a screen is somehow less real? I'm not sure how to put it into words but seeing it through a screen doesn't seem to have the same effect as seeing it for real. Which I'm not sure whether that's because of trauma and it's some sort of defence mechanism? Or whether it's because we grew up with screens and anything that's on a screen is deemed fake or staged. I'm not sure and won't claim to know.\n\nEdit 2: also just to clarify, I'm not trying to invalidate your feelings about your trauma just so we're clear. I don't know you, or what you've gone through. I'm just speaking out of a generalization that I don't think everyone is traumatized because it's not like we went through WW3 or something. I mean maybe we still will but we haven't yet and that's what matters. XD\n\nEdit 3: I think having constant easy access to news and information from across the globe probably fucked with our brains too, ESPECIALLY during COVID when our generation started being sort of forced into politics? Misinformation and cognitive dissonance sowed by News outlets, social media, political parties and whatever else definitely played a role in radicalizing a portion of the generation. As for social media I mean it's pretty much always been a part of our lives and some people have always been hooked on it more than others. It's probably playing some sort of role in current behaviors but I'd reckon it's probably not the cause of all of this, maybe a stressor sure but not the root cause.\n\nEdit 4: damn this is getting really god damn long... But I wanted to expand on my point about socialization from the original comment. I think because the job market is so screwed, plus economical circumstances are pretty grim in a good portion of the developed world it makes it difficult for anyone to correct for those \"lost\" COVID years. Everybody is either busy working to not go homeless, or has no job and therefore no money to spend on social activities. This is with the assumption that you have friends to even hang out in the first place, and if you don't you're basically out of luck because again, learned isolation from COVID lockdowns... :/",

Now with reddit and tiktok and all the other social medias, you can see/read and can interact with like a hundred people a day. It's just really overwhelming and the sheer volume makes it difficult to connect fully, and makes us less motivated to connect when it really matters (like in our community and interpersonal relationships). But yeah it can feel very messed up at times. Like downright horrifying what humans will do when it's truly life or death, you or me. I hope we can overcome it but I'm so worried that's just wishful thinking lmfaoo. Srry for the long random blurb. But I do believe humans can be altruistic and empathetic if our society shifts to valuing those over profit and individualism",

I never said you hate men or hate all men.  What I said is you've all been trained to despise other identity groups.  Not just you, all of you.  All of us, frankly.  I don't even know your gender.  Also, he did not say men join the far right **at significantly higher rates than women**.  You read that into his statement.  You jumped to a few conclusions there.\n\nYour response to him was completely lacking in any kind of empathy, regardless of whether he is a man or woman, black or white, gay or straight, trans or cis.    If you can't see that, I honestly don't know how to show it to you; it was very much invalidating.  Are you able to imagine being in a relationship with someone and loving them only to find out later that it was all a joke in the other person's eyes?  Are you able to imagine what that feels like?  That's empathy.  If you are truly able to imagine that, and the pain and confusion it must cause, you would not be so cold.  If you had told me, \"Someone robbed me,\" and I replied with, \"Happens to other people every day,\" I have a strong feeling you would not respond well to that because it's invalidating and lacking in empathy.\n\nThe dynamic of men seeking role models and acceptance in bad places is widely known and has been going on for a long time, it's not exclusive to right-wing activities.  Young men join gangs, criminal enterprises, or extremist political organizations primarily for the same core reason: they seek acceptance among other men, particularly men who could serve as role models (even if they are bad role models).\n\nWhen our society pits one group against another, and every group against every other group, no one will ever win.  There will never be equality or equity.  It will be a never-ending game of revenge with no winner and only losers.  It's never going to be \"even\" which is why understanding and forgiveness are paramount.  **We are human beings first and foremost and many people on all sides of the political spectrum no longer care about treating other human beings as they would like to be treated.**",

He said, in response to \u201cmen lack empathy in particular\u201d: \u201c***BECAUSE MEN*** often feel left behind, ***THUS*** they join the far right. I was in a relationship where my girlfriend didn\u2019t even love me, but she did it as a joke. ***And then you wonder why US MEN have empathy issues***\u201d. \n\nWhy would you sandwich an example of a hurtful experience in between two arguments as supporting evidence for those arguments then expect people to ignore the arguments and only respond to the hurtful experience? That\u2019s such an unfair expectation lol.\n\nIf I said \u201cwomen in particular lack empathy because we\u2019re disrespected by society. I was robbed once. And you wonder why women lack empathy.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t take you saying \u201cmen are also robbed\u201d personally because the point of my comment wasn\u2019t about me getting robbed, it was to explain why women in particular lack empathy, and you\u2019d be right to point out that getting robbed isn\u2019t exclusive to women therefore it\u2019s not the reason for the unique lack of empathy among women. \n\nIt\u2019s standard logical reasoning that you cannot say \u201cGroup A has higher rates of XYZ than Group B because they experience this particular phenomenon\u201d when Group B also experiences the phenomenon. It objectively cannot be the reason. It\u2019s not in empathetic to point that out just because the particular phenomenon is sad.",

I see what you mean and in hindsight, my reply was not written as well as it should be.  The entirety of my initial statement did not apply just to you and your response.  This portion applied to you:\n\n*This is the problem right here. Someone says, \"I have been hurt.\" Someone else says, \"So have other people.\"*\n\nYour reply was a good example of what I see as a problem in our society.  I see this a lot.  A LOT.  I didn't see this as often when your generation was watching Sesame Street.  It existed but it wasn't everywhere like it is now.\n\nThe remainder of my initial statement was meant for all of us.  We've all been trained to despise other groups, that's why identity politics is such a hot button issue these days.  It's not really our fault, it's the system in which we live and have been influenced by.  The internet has drastically accelerated this phenomenon.  I would argue that no one has been subjected to such heavy influence as Gen Z precisely because you were born into a world where this phenomenon was accelerating, thanks to the growth of the internet.  If people had walked around in the 80s or 90s and talked to people the way most people today talk to each other on the internet, there'd be a lot of injuries and butt kicking.  Not saying that violence is right, just saying that people say things on the internet that they would not say in real life due to fear of retaliation.\n\nWhat is popular today is a mentality that pits group against group and encourages a game of revenge that never ends (which is basic human nature and I'd argue it's one of the main reasons laws exist in the first place).  If people were legally allowed and even encouraged to get revenge for killing, the killing would never stop.\n\nBy the way, I didn't ignore half of his statement.  I responded to it in my last reply:\n\n*The dynamic of men seeking role models and acceptance in bad places is widely known and has been going on for a long time, it's not exclusive to right-wing activities. Young men join gangs, criminal enterprises, or extremist political organizations primarily for the same core reason: they seek acceptance among other men, particularly men who could serve as role models (even if they are bad role models).*\n\nI go back to this: *Someone says, \"I have been hurt.\" Someone else says, \"So have other people.\"*  Nothing you or anyone else can say is going to convince me that this mentality is anything but a problem and it's perpetuation will only lead to more and more problems.\n\nPeople say the internet isn't real life, but it most certainly is.  Just because it isn't spoken doesn't mean it's not real.  We don't have a political problem in a vacuum.  We have a cultural and moral problem that has created a political problem (and I would argue an economic problem).\n\nEdit: If I haven't made this clear yet, we are all lacking in empathy in this modern world.  Men and women.  Men and women respond to situations differently because they are, in fact, different.  Hormones and social conditioning create different behavior.  Men join criminal and extremist organizations in higher rates than women as a response to feeling \"left behind.\"",

Logical fallacies are intentional or unintentional errors in logic that on the surface seem reasonable, but they actually fail to prove a point. \n\nOne example of a logical fallacy is an Omission fallacy. This is when you ignore certain facts to argue your point. An example of this would be \u201cGroup A does X action at higher rates than Group B because Group A experiences Y phenomenon,\u201d when Group B also experiences Y phenomenon. An appropriate response to this logical fallacy would be to say \u201cGroup B also experiences Y, so Y cannot be the reason\u201d.   This has nothing to do with Y. This has to do with the logic of the argument; hence why I can use a variable for Y and still describe the fallacy.\n\nAnother example of a logical fallacy is a strawman argument. A strawman argument is misinterpreting a persons argument and arguing against this falsely manufactured argument as opposed to their original claim. You can imagine it as arguing with a fake person that you made up, like the \u201cstrawman\u201d metaphor. One example of this would be if someone were to respond to \u201cGroup B also experiences Y, so Y is not the reason for Group A\u2019s behavior\u201d to the omission fallacy described above with \u201cYou have no empathy for the Y experience\u201d. The actual argument was \u201cBoth groups experience Y, so Y cannot account for one groups unique behavior,\u201d and not \u201cBoth groups experience Y, so Y is not a valid experience\u201d. Combatting the omission fallacy is not about the Y experience. \n\nAnother strawman would be responding to \u201cyou\u2019re ignoring half of what the person who I\u2019m replying to said\u201d with \u201cbut I said these things to support the claim that they\u2019re making after you replied to them\u201d to express your issue with the person\u2019s response to the original claim. The original response was made before you made your arguments, and it was not directed towards you. You\u2019re misrepresenting the argument that the reply in question was actually targeted towards. \n\nI agree that if someone were to say \u201cI had a hurtful experience\u201d and someone else said \u201ca lot of people have had that experience so it doesn\u2019t matter\u201d that would be unempathetic. I have no problem saying that, because that\u2019s not what I did. I hope that you can find someone who actually did this to argue with.",

It almost always has to do with insufficient pay too.\n\nThese sorts of behaviors are enabled at home, by parents, who somehow can't discipline their children.\n\nI don't buy into the frankly very nihilistic notion that one is burdening their children simply by choosing to conceive them. It's a great justification to have should one decide to be childfree, for any number of reasons, but does not apply here because we're talking about children that are already born. Since they're already born, the least you could do as parents is to discipline them to set them up for life.\n\nAgain, you have conflated disciplining with abuse, which is false equivalency.

Without accountability people think they can do whatever they want without limit. I am not advocating for a lack of accountability, quite the opposite.\n\nBut we can hold people accountable and show empathy in understanding how they got to the point they did, so that we can judge them based on what would actually help reduce further recidivism.\n\nSo in that regard, blanket empathy actually still works. Empathy does NOT mean we let people do whatever they want, it simply means we can put ourselves in the shoes of another and go from event to event to understand why they did what they did, what drove them to do it, and find ways to address the situation effectively.\n\nI tend to like the way nordic countries do their prison system, because in their case they show a lot of empathy to their prisoners which in turn helps them become better people on their way out. As a result, their recidivism is reduced because kindness was a part of the sentence - doesn't mean they weren't removed from society, it just means that the system gets to the bottom of what caused the person to mess up.\n\nIn the US, though, it's all punishment. There is no rehabilitation. There is no reduction of recidivism. In a lot of ways, the US criminal justice system is set up to have repeat offenders due to the way it penalizes them at every stage post-incarceration.\n\nSo don't think that blanket empathy is some sort of ill, because it's not. It isn't some get-of-jail-free card either, it simply allows you a greater perspective on everything around you.",
