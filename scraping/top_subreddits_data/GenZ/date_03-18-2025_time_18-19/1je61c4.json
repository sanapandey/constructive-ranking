    "selftext": "Someone ate all my pudding.\n\nSo yesterday I went shopping and bought 4 of the 4 packs of pudding and I think I had two unopened ones at home. I wake up this morning to be told all my tapioca pudding is gone, which is fine. I've definitely gone overboard on some pudding cups before. Well then I'm told that same person also ate two cans of my soup and that's mildly infuriating since there wasn't a sale on soup so I paid 2 dollars for those babies, but anyway I go downstairs to eat some pudding for breakfast and there is 5 pudding cups in there. 5. Motherfucker ate almost 20 pudding cups in one day. That's almost 2000 calories just in pudding. How the fuck are you eating that much pudding? ",
