And as others have said: it seems like posts that are anti-trump don't get to stay up forever, while bigotry and misinformation run rampant in comments.\n\nI'd also love to be able to read what they said, because as I said elsewhere it does seem like a lot of this stuff comes true just a few days after reporting now. What was OP of that post saying exactly, does anyone know? With how things are going, they could have been right about efforts to invalidate passports of certain groups being underway. Like I'm waiting for more chaos with transgender people's passports and other legal paperwork, for example.\n\nEDIT: [Comments like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1igp3r8/comment/maqxg2z/) are what I'm talking about. Would put the comment verbatim, but not repeating that hate. Basically said trans kids don't exist and is clearly bigoted while defending fascists. I tagged them there so maybe it will be deleted, but most comments like that aren't. Those are the issues, not these \"fearmongering\" posts.",

Jumping to conclusions and fearmongering are different, this is the first.\n\nIt's a legit fear based off all the bullshit they've been doing, government websites and services are going down left and right or undergoing maintenance despite claims from the government they're not. So at the time, and even still now, it is definitely totally understandable to think they're attacking another thing.\n\nIt's better to wait for confirmation for sure, but given our situation this is not the same category as fearmongering. People are mostly trying to get info out because mainstream media has failed us. As mentioned elsewhere, the last couple of weeks have seen things said that are revealed true within hours. It's not fearmongering when it's clearly just people trying to spread info about what they're doing, and fast because these evil bastards are working fast.\n\nBottom line: mods should be moderating comment sections a fuckton better than they currently are, as that's where the problems actually are, while the sort of posts they're talking about are usually taken care of quick. Like there are tons of comments on other posts that violate rule 1 that are up for hours while that sort of post they linked is gone within an hour. Make it make sense.",

I am afraid by the time Trump's term is over, if Joe is still alive, his good days may be in the past.\n\nI even feel like the last year or so, it bordered on legit elder abuse, and I'm sympathetic to Joe the man, even if I despised him as POTUS.  I also don't care much for Donald on a personal level, but I don't have to like the person to like the results.  And I did business with his company in the past, which included meeting him a time or three, though I'd pass out from shock if he remembers.  Honestly, I was paying more attention to his daughters tits at the time.0",

Another possibility is that since Musk bought Twitter, a lot of social media platforms have been pushing more right-wing content. I am about as left as you can be, but I still am attacked by political ads favoring Republicans. So people being told something enough with some one-off cases of \"proof\" will eventually cause a shift. You saw this happening with Springfield, OH, as Vance admitted to making it up. So people start doubting their party and go the other way. Another point is that a lot of people don't understand politics all that well. Anyone who took civics in high school would know the vice president doesn't get to do what they want but what their boss tells them. Republicans ran as if she got to choose what to do by calling it the Harris administration (or similar). Constantly asking if we are better under her control, which just isn't true because she was never in control. I think the answer is a lot more complicated than this, and it's only the tip.",

                                                            "author": "Sithire",
                                                            "body": "Also heres what a breakdown of that article looks like\n\nBias:\n\nPolitical Bias: The article shows a clear bias against Donald Trump and in favor of Kamala Harris. The title itself frames the 2024 election outcome in a way that suggests vote suppression was the decisive factor in Trump's victory, which implies skepticism about the legitimacy of the election results. Phrases like \"Trump Lost. Vote Suppression Won.\" and descriptions of actions taken by election officials and others as \"shafting people of color out of their ballot\" indicate a strong partisan viewpoint.\n\nSource Bias: Pride Publishing Group is known for publishing content that often aligns with progressive or left-leaning political perspectives. This does not necessarily invalidate the information but suggests a potential slant in how issues are presented.\n\nSelection of Data: The article selectively focuses on data points that support its narrative of widespread voter suppression. For instance, it mentions specific numbers of voters purged or ballots rejected without acknowledging counterarguments or data from other sources that might show different interpretations or results.\n\nCredibility of Claims:\n\nSource of Data: The article heavily relies on data from Greg Palast, an investigative journalist known for his work on voter suppression. While Palast has exposed real issues in past elections, his methods and conclusions are often contentious:\n\nElections Assistance Commission Data: The claim of 4,776,706 voters wrongly purged is based on this data, but without context, such as how these numbers were calculated or verified independently, the credibility is hard to assess fully.\n\nNAACP of Georgia's Estimates: The figure of 200,000 voter challenges in Georgia alone is attributed to the NAACP, but this estimate would need further substantiation to be considered fully credible.\n\nDisqualification of Ballots: The numbers for disqualified mail-in and provisional ballots are significant, but the article does not delve into the reasons for disqualification, which could range from valid procedural issues to deliberate suppression.\n\nLack of Counterarguments: The article does not engage with or refute potential counterarguments, such as the legality of voter purges under federal and state laws, the verification processes for mail-in ballots, or the efforts by election officials to ensure voter integrity.\n\nVerification: While some of the numbers might be based on real data, the interpretation and framing by Greg Palast are not presented with counterpoints or alternative analyses, which are crucial for credibility in such contentious topics.\n\nContextualization: The article lacks context regarding how voter purges, challenges, and ballot disqualifications compare to previous elections or how these practices are regulated across different states. This context would help in assessing whether the claims are exaggerated or within historical norms.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBias: The article exhibits clear political bias, framing the election outcome in a light that criticizes one side while potentially ignoring complexities or opposing views.\n\nCredibility: The credibility of the claims depends on the reader's willingness to accept Greg Palast's analysis without a broader array of sources or counterarguments. While there's no doubt that voter suppression is an issue in U.S. elections, the specific assertions made would require more comprehensive research, verification, and balanced reporting to be fully credible. For further substantiation, one would need to look at official election reports, independent audits, or analyses by non-partisan organizations.\n\nIn essence, while the article raises important issues about voter suppression, its credibility is hampered by its one-sided presentation and lack of comprehensive, balanced data analysis.\n\npretty much completely dismantles its argument lol.",

Anyone was allowed in if they simply claimed asylum. They'd get appointments to meet back with ice or immigration judges to see if the asylum claim was legit, but it was so many people that the appointments would be like 7 years down the line. The number of crossings increased on from a few hundred thousand a year to over two million per year. Describing this situation as effectively open borders is pretty accurate.\n\nRegardless, this sub wasn't even flooded with fear mongering posts about Biden.\n\nOne of the top posts last week was about how federal funding grants froze FAFSA funds and Pell grants when that explicitly wasn't the case and most news articles said that if you read them. It got over 10k upvotes. That's problematic.",

Mods need to do a better job of looking at comments. Hell, all they'd have to do is sort by controversial and that's where it is. Not even differences of opinions, it's where the hate and misinformation is most of the time. Some very vile and hurtful shit is said there and either allowed to exist for hours before being touched or is just left alone.\n\nBoth of these make Reddit mods, like yourselves, just look complicit in the fascism and endorse the hate and misinformation. Please prove to us you are not: work on the second and get rid of bias for the first.",
