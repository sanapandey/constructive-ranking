    "selftext": "that word has gotten so twisted and warped by politics that it doesn\u2019t even mean anything anymore. But this group is probably one of the few places where I think some people won\u2019t feel a political gut reaction. I\u2019m not talking about the whole black ally use of the word either. I\u2019m talking about around 2015 when woke was kinda like a hipster Gen Z way of saying wise. Conscious. Aware of the matrix. \n\nwas I the only one who knew even back then that the system wouldn\u2019t let that word survive? ",
