That being said, while elemental Mercury is relatively inert, the issue is that a small portion of it can be converted by the body into methyl mercury, and even small amounts can have severe neurological impacts. Worse, it's a bio accumulator, as the body does not have mechanisms of getting rid of it, which is why it accumulates in apex predators like Tuna.",

Iron is an exception, and iron flasks have traditionally been used to transport the material. Several other first row transition metals with the exception of manganese, copper and zinc are also resistant in forming amalgams.\n\nBecause it is largely unreactive like most of the heavy metals in the same area (platinum, gold). you generally pass it through too quickly, though apparently it can build up in other parts of your body over time(like other heavy metals) to form salts.",

By far the principal danger is the fumes, and although it is absorbed through the skin, the reason you're told not to hold mercury is because holding it means breathing more fumes.\n\nYou can even inject it, and the thickness of it clogging up blood vessels (particularly in lungs) is the most dangerous part.

On the amateur level there are absolutely some cases. There is a whole backyard industry of stealth electric bikes.

I suspect if a real advantage was gained it would probably be lower CG which would allow him to take tigter and more aggressive turns downhill than other cyclists. that should get many more bike widths than the terminal velocity gain, but I'm just guessing.\n\nin any case this was never proven, never even formally accused actually. and even if it were true it wouldn't have been cheating because it was 1940s and rules against doing such things weren't in place yet. this TIL is a nothing burger compared to what the title implies.",
