            "body": "Languages change. The word \"terrible\" used to convey a bit of a different meaning than it does today, so \"the Terrible\" was a valid translation, meaning \"someone who inspires terror\". Nowadays, however, \"terrible\"  is rarely used in this connotation, being somewhat replaced by \"terrifying\". Instead, it more often than not means \"inept\", \"unskilful\" or \"bad\". \n\n\"\u0413\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0439\" can be translated in many ways. It comes from the verb \"\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442\u044c\", meaning \"to threaten\" or \"to intimidate\". So nowadays it would be better translated as \"formidable\", \"terrifying\", \"menacing\", \"threatening\".",

God is huge, imposing, awesome (awful, same root), terror-inducing (but God is Good, so terrific must mean good).

Terror is finding people being torn apart putting you in danger, horrific is finding that your family has been torn apart but you're not in immediate peril.  Terror fills you with adrenaline, horror fills your mind and emotions with paralysis and disbelief.",
