Did anyone even need to watch that episode to write the script themselves? Was anyone in doubt of exactly what would happen? Of course not. Ai could have written, directed and filmed that movie just by replacing a few words.\n\nSame way AI could have written \"wolves of the  CallA\" \n\nLiterally the exact same story, and it was old hat more than 2 decades ago when Stephen King put in effort to differentiate it from all those that came before\n\n\n\n\n Based on is a bit more than replacing Mexico, and gangsters with alien planet and stormtroopers",

William Shatner as Kirk, George Reeves as Superman, and Adam West as Batman are the most notorious examples. Nowadays it isn't so pronounced but some actors spend years struggling to get top-tier work after playing certain roles. Hayden Christensen and Daisy Ridley more recently come to mind.",
