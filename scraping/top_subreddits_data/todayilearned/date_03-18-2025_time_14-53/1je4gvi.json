Like they wouldn\u2019t even let him read for the role.\n\nHe only ended up landing the part because that same studio head heard his demo tape and, not knowing it was Pat Morita, said whoever that was is perfect for the role. \n\n[Here\u2019s a hilarious video of Morita discussing it](https://youtu.be/MoBeHY1Rvs0?si=ksEIUOp7GKTHHkPa).  I especially love his mimicking the studio heads voice.",

One was named Arnold, as in Arnold's Diner, and portrayed by Pat Morita. The other was named Al Delvecchio, portrayed by Al Molinaro.\n\n>In actuality, Big Al appears in the diner before Arnold ever does.\n\n>The first episode to feature Al Delvecchio came in the second season.

One of my other favorites is Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger) auditioned for apocalypse now and in the same building George Lucas was doing auditions for Star wars. Robert managed to speak to somebody from the casting crew about the role and when he ultimately didn't get the part, he told Mark Hamill about it. \n\nIf I recall correctly, Mark's agent had already set up an audition for him for the role.",
