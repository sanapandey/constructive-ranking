CJD is different from variant CJD, the disease in humans thought to be associated with Mad Cow disease in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. There is no longer a deferral for travel, residence or transfusion in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and France from 1980 to present, which was previously considered a geographic risk of possible exposure to vCJD. Individuals who have been previously deferred for travel, residence or transfusion in the United Kingdom, Ireland and France can initiate donor reinstatement by contacting the Red Cross Donor and Client Support Center at 1-866-236-3276. Individuals with questions about their donation eligibility can contact the Red Cross Donor and Client Support Center at 1-866-236-3276.\n\n> CJD appears to be an infectious disease. It has been transmitted from infected humans to patients through the transplantation of the covering of the brain (dura mater), use of contaminated brain electrodes, and injection of growth hormones derived from human pituitary glands. Rarely, CJD is associated with a hereditary predisposition; that is, it occurs in biologic or \u201cblood\u201d relatives (persons in the same genetic family).\n\n> There is evidence that CJD can be transmitted from donors to patients through blood transfusions. There is no test for CJD that could be used to screen blood donors. This means that blood programs must take special precautions to keep CJD out of the blood supply by not taking blood donations from those who might have acquired this infection.\n\n> You are considered to be at higher risk of carrying CJD if you received a dura mater (brain covering) graft. If you have had a dura mater transplant, you cannot donate blood until more is known about CJD and the risk to the blood supply. If you have been diagnosed with vCJD, CJD or any other TSE or have a blood relative diagnosed with genetic CJD (e.g., fCJD, GSS, or FFI) you cannot donate. If you received an injection of cadaveric pituitary human growth hormone (hGH) you cannot donate. Human cadaveric pituitary-derived hGH was available in the U.S. from 1958 to 1985.  Growth hormone received after 1985 is acceptable.\n\nAm I being dumb? Elsewhere on the internet I see that it says you still can\u2019t donate blood in Spain. Just curious because my partner has lived between Britain and Spain and has been told she can\u2019t donate blood (years ago) and has always assumed that still stands",

While the prions accumulate in the brain, we know that the prions do indeed exist elsewhere, and we have detected them in non-CNS tissue. Given the fact that there are several routes of transmission where the infected party did not eat any brains, this is sort of obvious, however there's a bunch of evidence detecting prions outside of the CNS. A few years ago, a research group based out of the University of Texas developed a test that allowed for the detection of prions in human blood, and published their results in [Science Translational Medicine](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf6188). This was huge, however, it was not the only time we've found prions outside of the CNS. \n\nHere's a paper published in the [Journal of Infectious Disease ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2803675/)that found prions in the fecal matter of Hamsters, suggesting a copraphagic route of transmission for herbivores. This makes sense, as many herbivores are affected by prion diseases, despite the fact that they do not eat the brains of any animals. \n\nHere's a paper published in[ Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC122606/) that found prions in skeletal muscle (that's the kind of tissue that represents most cuts of meat) of mice. Here's one from the journal [Emerging Infectious Disease](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11845151/) that detected prions in several cuts of elk meat. \n\nLooking for more human data? Here's a paper published in [Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10723238/) where a study found prions detectable in the urine of infected patients. \n\nThis is why eating infected meat is so dangerous - not because you're eating cow-brain, but because the meat contains the infectious agent as well.",

This is part of why its spread was so frightening to the public - these cases weren't happening as the result of intentional choices, they were a byproduct of a part of the food system that is (still, honestly) completely opaque to everyday consumers. Unfortunately it wasn't as easy to avoid as \"well, just don't eat brains then!\"\n\nI obviously don't know if that's specifically what happened to your grandma (as other comments note, it can develop on its own in humans too in rare cases), but in general, that's how people were being infected during that particularly well-known scare. I'm sorry for your loss, that's terrible that that happened to her.",

The theory stated that the outbreak started after cows were fed meat and bone meal made from infected *human* remains.\n\nMeat and bone meal was imported in large quantities to the UK from India from the 1960s onwards. The industry was known to be very poorly regulated. Many human bodies are given an aquatic burial in the Ganges river for religious reasons. The theory goes that a human died of normal CJD, their body was placed in the Ganges, the remains then washed up at a sluice gate where they were collected by poor scavengers and sold to one of the animal feed factories. Cows ate the infected material and the outbreak started.\n\nThe feeding of meat and bone meal to farm animals has since been banned in the UK.\n\nThe theory rejects the conventional hypothesis that the outbreak was started by Scrapie infected sheep fed to cattle as Scrapie has been endemic in UK sheep herds for over 200 years without jumping species.",

They aren't \"evil\" or viral in nature, so \"hijacking\" isn't a great word, but if you got a bunch of proteins that aren't shaped right and thus don't work, you have a problem.\n\nBecause they're so stable, you can't even destroy them in an autoclave. If surgical instruments get prions on them, and are then used on you, this is an infection route. \n\nDon't eat people.",

            "body": "Maybe a scientist can help us, but I went to chatgpt to ask a couple questions. Interesting enough, the wiki mentions meat, but doesn't specifically mention this or that animal. Asking chatgpt, turns out scientists have been unable to find prion related diseases in chicken and fish, even attempting to induce it. As for pork, no evidence has been found so far, but there's this \"just in case\" attitude, so is strictly forbidden to feed pigs with potentially contaminated meat. What's the deal with cows and sheep? In fact, looks like only a few wild animals show prion related diseases, and none have been confirmed to transmit it to humans. Boars and wild pigs are clear, just like their domestic cousins. Same with bears. However, deer, moose, and the like have a prion disease, but haven't been confirmed it can be transmitted to humans. So looks like prion related diseases are almost limited to cows and sheep. Bad luck to ethnic groups that don't eat pork, I guess. \n\nScientific trivia aside as mexican, this is more important than you think. One of our most popular dishes \"carnitas\" (could be translated as \"little meats\"?) is basically chopping and boiling a pork, so no part, absolutely no part is wasted. Brains are mixed with other ingredients, folded in a tortilla and deep fried and are usually part of the options when eating carnitas. Point is if prion related diseases were transmissible through pig meat, Mexico would be in deep shit.",
