The wounds listed in the sources for Caesar's death mention most being superficial (like the knife skipping across and just nicking skin) due to the chaos and ill-preparedness of the assassins. The only noteworthy pre-mortem ones noted are one to the thigh, one to the face, one to the groin (ouch), and a fatal one below the left shoulder blade, which would've most likely hit his heart. Given two weeks who's to say he wouldn't have died from infection or complications from the thigh, face, or groin stabbing, but its a fair assumption to say of the listed ones, the stab through the left mid back into the aortic cavity was probably the most dangerous one, assuming the thigh stab didn't hit the femoral artery.",
