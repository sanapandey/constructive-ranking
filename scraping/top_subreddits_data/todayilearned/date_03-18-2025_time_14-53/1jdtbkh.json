I'd rather watch YouTube videos that are 20-90 minutes than either though, usually more education, lore, or journalism related stuff.\n\n\nmy peers would rather watch xqc react to brainrot tiktoks with half the screen having a car in GTA V doing tricks on ramps and a little spot for subway surfers. it's tough out here man.",

The buck has to stop somewhere, and it stops with them.\n\nThe issues at hand might not be the parent's *fault*, but it sure as FUCK is their *responsibility* to deal with. \n\nThat's. What. Being. An. Adult. Is. All. About.\n\nPut away the screens. And it starts with the parents. You see parents glued to their stupid mobile phones, so the kids emulate that behavior. \n\nIn short, *start acting like the fucking adult and PARENT*. You're not merely a grown-up child, so stop acting like one.\n\n----\n\nSimple rule #1 -- mobile devices aren't for entertainment. They're a tool...use it only as needed, then put it *away*. Treat devices like a Palm Pilot -- not as a surgically grafted extension of their bodies. And when you can use an analog version of a service -- like an address book, calendar, to do list, shopping list, etc....use that instead of using electronics.\n\n----\n\nSimple rule #2 -- kids do not get mobile devices. Or more so, they do not get smart devices -- only basic flip phones -- ONLY when they have a demonstrated need for communication TO/FROM home/parents. And those devices are regulated and monitored...and if they are abused, they get taken away. \n\nThey see their friends ALL DAY LONG in school. They don't need to be digitally attached at the hip to them also. It makes them value time spent in-person instead of walking through life in a digital haze.\n\nIt teaches them to make plans and to communicate in advance, skills that aren't reinforced if everyone is texting to each other on the fly. \n\n------\n\nBehavior doesn't change magically on its own.

Front desk was being pedantic and wouldn't allow him back into the room barely past checkout.\n\nSuddenly he feels a tap on his shoulder, \"You're welcome to change in my room.\"\n\nAnd it was none other than.\n\nHe changed in Mr. Rogers' room, chatted a bit, got an autograph for the kids, and caught his flight.\n\nI had the same reaction you did. \nThat it's perhaps one of the *only people on the planet* you could say yes to without carefully scrutinizing motivations.

The original philosophical purpose of Sesame Street was to address the major gap in reading abilities between inner city(mostly black) children and their suburban white counterparts. It was created after a TV executed noticed how easily his daughter could memorize TV jingles, and it is no coincidence that Jim Henson and his team got their start in advertising. Sesame Street was made to be flashy and exciting to CATCH the attention of children and, hopefully, impart reading skills while they were absorbed by the flashy, exciting content.\n\nMr. Rogers on the other hand was trying to deliberately teach kids social and emotional skills, so a slower, more calming pace was more appropriate in that context.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that one was better than the other. They were using different approaches to achieve different goals. Going on a nature walk is a great way to promote mindfulness and perspective, but it\u2019s not the best environment for learning phonics or timetables.",

For example, one week might be about Daniel's fear of heights or whatever and every day Daniel had a new perspective or learned something new about fears in general, heights, and maybe trying something that got him more comfortable with heights.. If you visit the Mr. Rogers site that hosts free episodes, they release a week at a time for this reason, to keep the weekly story grouped together as best as possible. \n\nWe binge episodic story telling as adults, but as children, it probably instills repetition and making small steps towards larger goals.",

It says that compared to *Sesame Street* watchers, *Mister Rogers* watchers remembered more *and* had higher tolerance of delay. It cites *The Simple Faith of Mister Rogers* by Hollingsworth, which *actually* claims that Yale psychologists determined *MR* to be easier to follow than the fast-paced *SS* (uncited). Hollingsworth says a *different* study concluded that *MR* increases tolerance of delay, citing [Friedrich 1973](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1975-05254-001), which indeed found that 4 weeks of *MR* (6 h tot) or children's films (5 h tot) led to an increase in tolerance, whereas *Batman* and *Superman* (8 h tot) led to a decrease.\n\nFurther searching suggests that Hollingsworth's uncited claim refers to work by Jerome Singer of Yale in the '70s. I narrowed it down to [Tower 1979](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-43131-009), which found that after 2 weeks of *MR* or *SS* (5 h tot), children answered correctly 46% of questions asked about *MR* and 45% of questions about *SS*, a difference that was not statistically significant. So Hollingsworth also misreported this finding! The differences they were actually looking for (and found) were that *MR*, being simple and direct, yielded greater recall of factual information, whereas *SS*, with fewer explicitly stated messages, yielded greater inferential recall. (Perhaps we shouldn't have expected much rigor from Amazon's \"Best Seller in Christian Inspiration\".)\n\nThis is hardly the only time Tower 1979 has been misreported. [Here's a letter](https://www.edweek.org/education/opinion-letters-to-the-editor-1/1990/10) from Daniel Anderson of UMass complaining about an incorrect summary of it back in 1990!\n\nAnyway, it doesn't say which seasons.\n\nBonus material from Tower: \"none of the children could remember the name of the caduceus, a label Mr. Rogers had spent much time discussing. Nor did any of them grasp that an opera is a story that is sung, despite an entire week devoted to producing one. In contrast, over 90% of the children remembered the name of a book Mr. Rogers read and what its cover looked like, the fact that he tried on a mustache, and the way a pitchpipe works... [In SS,] 80%-90% of them grasped the consequences of a carefully designed 'what if' sequence, and could recall shapes they had seen, animals, the concept 'between,' and Oscar the Grouch's absurd attempt at photography.\"",

So presumably that\u2019s 5 episodes of each show since they aired M-F, this is a very short time frame. Mr Roger\u2019s was a 30 minute show and Sesame Street was a 60 minute show so these kids would have watched 2x as much TV if they were in the Sesame Street group. I can\u2019t tell from the abstract how many children were involved in the study but my guess is less than 150.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019d need to actually read the study to have an informed opinion but it\u2019s not looking like a particularly good study as it stands.",

The results showed that although the children paid more attention to \u201cSesame Street,\u201d they did not learn or remember more than they did after watching \u201cMister Rogers.\u201d\n>\nIn fact, the researchers report in The American Journal of Orthopsychiatry, \u201cif anything, the rapid pace and cluttering of material in 'sesame Street\u2019 may have impeded\u201d learning, particularly among less intelligent boys. They concluded that the format of \u201cSesame Street\u201d may present problems for the very children it is supposed to help.\n>\nIn addition, after watching \u201cMister Rogers\u201d for 10 days, the children cooperated better With adults, whereas those who watched \u201cSesame Street\u201d became less cooperative. Both pro. grams enhanced imaginative play by the children in comparison to the effect of the neutral\u2019 films:\n>\nAlthough public television is no longer producing new \u201cMister Rogers\u201d shows, the program is in continuous reruns (aired at 5 P.M. every weekday and at 9 A.M. Saturday on WNET in New York).",

Affordable home satellite TV didn\u2019t exist back then, and no Canadian broadcasters rebroadcast Mister Rogers that I\u2019ve ever heard of, though Sesame Street was carried by CBC in the 80s.",

He was teaching awareness and mindfulness decades before they became buzzwords, and his soothing demeanor helped us sit still for long enough to learn about them. \n\nSesame Street was not made for the same market as Mr. Rogers neighborhood - it was for inner city minority kids and intended to both supplement their (by-design) substandard education and demonstrate etiquette and social skills to kids that often came from broken homes. \n\nIts model was extremely successful. Henson/CTW borrowed from the early prototypes of what would become known as play therapy by their use of puppets who are never blatantly seen with their performers. I didn't know who Karol Spinney was back in 1990, but I knew big bird was my friend and as a 5 year old, we had a lot in common. I'd say that for a kid coming from hard knocks, the implications of having a really cute, harmless little monster friend that lives in a box and teaches you difficult stuff with familiar language, scenery, and music ought to speak for themselves.",

They also said it's better for parents to be watching with them\n\n>The Singers\u2019 research demonstrates that Barney\u2014along with such other programs on the educational circuit as Mr. Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood, Sesame Street, Square One TV, and DeGrassi Junior High\u2014works best when parents watch along with their kids.\n\n...Ctrl+F the word Delay and this is the only one that shows up:\n\n> She, like her husband, grew up in the radio age, and they have found the comparisons of the pre- and post-TV experiences instructive. \u201cI once got together with my brothers, and we talked about the main character in the radio version of Buck Rogers. While each of us had powerful images of him, they were all different,\u201d she recalls. She contrasts that experience with one she had watching an MTV music video of a popular song called \u201cDancing.\u201d Singer had heard the tune earlier on the radio, and, she says, \u201cI just let my imagination go with it.\u201d The MTV interpretation, however, presented a completely different set of images than the ones she\u2019d created, and after viewing the video, she says, \u201cI couldn\u2019t get the MTV scenario out of my mind\u2014it forced my own imagination away.\u201d\n> \n> The same phenomenon occurred among the children the Singers observed in their studies. Jerome Singer feels that television\u2019s power to overwhelm the capacity for imaginative play could have \u201cserious consequences\u201d for youngsters. The data tend to bear out that fear. In research done by numerous other authorities in the field, **children who consistently flexed their imaginative muscles were compared with those who were less inclined to engage in such activities. The verdict: Imaginative play leads to an increased vocabulary, an increased use of imagery, greater flexibility, an enhanced ability to tolerate *delay*ed gratification, a decrease in impulsive and demanding behavior, more empathy, and less overt aggression.** \u201cThese kids actually make better distinctions between reality and fantasy than those who don\u2019t use their imaginations very much,\u201d says Jerome Singer.\n\nHere's the direct comparison between them:\n\n>One early stage in that quest brought them to Mr. Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood. The researchers were interested in the development of a child\u2019s imagination, and each show devoted time to taking children into the \u201cland of make-believe.\u201d In 1974, the Singers began watching youngsters watch the program, and they quickly learned, said Dorothy, that \u201cFred Rogers can really enhance a child\u2019s creativity.\u201d\n\n>Perhaps more important was a finding that they\u2019ve since corroborated time and time again: mediation\u2014be it from a teacher working with a lesson plan or a parent talking to a child about some aspect of a show\u2014makes a good program that much better (and, it turns out, a terrible show less bad).\n\n>The results of the Mr. Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood project led to a three-year, $312,000 grant from the National Science Foundation for further research and the establishment of the television study center at Yale. Armed with funds from the NSF and numerous foundations, the Singers have examined the effects of dozens of shows, including Sesame Street, the icon of educational television. \u201cBert,\u201d \u201cErnie,\u201d \u201cBig Bird,\u201d and the rest of the cast certainly help children \u201clearn numbers and letters,\u201d and the show presents youngsters with \u201cpositive social influences,\u201d notes Dorothy Singer, who adds that the program may be paced too fast and present too many segments for the younger members of its target audience to follow. The frenetic action does, however, keep parents interested, and the more a family watches, and interacts, with a program, the more young viewers can benefit.",
