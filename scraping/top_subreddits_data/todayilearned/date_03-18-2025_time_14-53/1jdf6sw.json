To me, it's a pretty simple reason, no?\n\n\nUltimately, I do think these tax dollars are well spent in securing the US position as a world superpower. Sure, there's definitely been failures (Cuba comes into mind), but we really only hear about the failures. Who knows how many times the CIA has influenced foreign governments to a position more advantageous for the US?\n\n\nEdit: Downvote me all you want, but the reality is that if the US isn't doing it, you're only opening the stage for Russia or China to do so.

Then you purposely leak several different alterations of the truth, with varying degrees of crazy attached to it so that you can easily discredit anyone who actually comes forward.\n\nIt's like how there were a lot of rumors about mind control experiments going around long before we found out about MKUltra. All the people talking about it were ignored because they were obviously just conspiracy theorists who believed in all sorts of crazy stuff. Or you know how it was just a crazy conspiracy theory that the government was spying on all our communications?\n\nThe people in power have no qualms about killing millions of innocent people if it helps them achieve their objectives and government agencies lie and do fucked up shit all the time.

The CIA/MIC has been running everything for the last 50 years. They control the schools, the media and have the ability to shape and control public opinion as a result.\n\nIn the 60s they used people like Ken Kesey and Gloria Steinem as a way to undermine anti-war, poverty activists by making boomer era college kids into sex, drugs, rock & roll. In the 90s, they used people like Kurt Cobain to turn gen-x kids apathetic, sad, and stupid. It's just gotten worse since.\n\nThey created the culture war as a form of information warfare and put Trump in so they could blame Russia and con people into supporting more endless wars.\n\nPeople like Snowden, Assange have been treated like criminals and traitors for doing what journalists are supposed to do. The US has been in like 19 wars since 1991, invaded Iraq twice based on lies, overthrew a bunch of other countries, economically destabilized other countries, and currently use Ukraine as a proxy against Russia while really just wanting their resources.\n\nThe US has been running secret prisons, kidnapping people, torturing people, killing them and just doing a lot of insanely horrible things while the US public is completely oblivious. The news doesn't report this stuff because of the way the media is set up. Corporations control the news, they work for the military establishment as a propaganda arm/censor.\n\nThis stuff was more well known back in the late 70s/early 80s but kind of got buried in the 90s.",

However, the rifle used in the assassination was made in 1940 for Italy's army, because bolt-action rifles were quite often used in WWII. Bolt-action rifles are still used frequently for hunting and sport and can be very accurate rifles. I have a sporterized Gewehr 98 made in 1918 and it's still a fine rifle.\n\nJFK was only hit once in the head, and once in the back/throat. One shot missed. Oswald was about 260 feet away, not yards, when he hit Kennedy in the head. Some have claimed 4 shots, but the film, witness testimony, and other evidence is more convincing.\n\n3 seconds? I think the shortest plausible time I've read is about 6 seconds, based on the Zapruder recording, but others have made good arguments for between 8-12 seconds for all 3 shots.\n\nI believe the car was moving even slower than 25 miles an hour, but that hardly matters because if you look at the perspective Oswald had from the book depository, the motorcade was travelling nearly parallel to his point of view. He would have had to adjust very little for the car's movement. Link: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:View_from_Sniper%27s_nest_to_Elm_Street,_CE724.jpg\n\nTwo out of three hits, with a bolt action with a scope, at less than a hundred yards, on a moving target, is not easy, but it's far from extraordinary. Especially for someone trained on how to shoot.\n\nThere's plenty to talk about conspiracy wise with JFK's assassination, but the claims that Oswald would have had to be an expert marksman or his rifle wasn't up to the task don't have merit.",

The program had many offshoots by other codenames. It 'officially' ended in the 70s but certainly at least informed current co-intel pro stuff, which is why you had had cruel and unusual punishment and extraordinary rendition in Iraq - Jon Ronson's book 'Men who stare at goats' goes into it.\n\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKUltra",

But since broadcast TV became mainstream in the 70's it has been refined into a science. And then given steroids with mass adoption of the Internet.\n\nP.S. since you don't seem to be familiar with this topic, where all if this started was the Korean war: the North Koreans developed \"reeducation camps.\" Where they used psychological torture to brain was POWs into believing they were actually North Koreans, and then sent them back to front lines to fight against their former allies.\n\nThe brain washing was so deep that they couldn't even speak English after the North Koreans were done with them, & they adamantly claimed they had been North Koreans for their entire life. However this brain washing was only effective short terms, & the victims would steadily remember who they were once they were removed from the camps. \n\nBut that fact didn't deter the hard on the CIA got at the idea of being able mentally manipulate enemy agents & creating sleeper agents with a hidden alternative personality ... The project failed from the perspective of practical application in espionage. But they got a ton of data on how to apply brain washing techniques to our own society, to increase obedience, conformity, and patriotism to \"The American Way.\"",

This is the last text message I received from him. \n\n\nMicrowave Hearing is all patented technology with a number of patents that comprise it.  It was developed by The United States Military but is being used to attack the population by intelligence agencies.  I get comments on everything I do and think and you think out loud to respond back to the Artificial Intelligence Operator.  It is hell and its all conversationalized.  It is not schizophrenia but mimics it.  I have had the v2k 'Voice to Skull' for about three years now and they have run a number of programs and impersonations like God, Jesus, and the Devil on me so I thought that was who it was and was responding as such.  Since the beginning of February 2017 the AI changed and is now a 'chatterbox' that directly interferes with everything I do and is fucking my life up as to right now I can't even live with my Fiance.  I can't develop music as of now either as it won't shut the fuck up.  It is going on five months of nonstop chatter from voices that say \"I will torture you if you take a shower.  I will torment and torture you if you make music.\". When I look in the mirror brushing my teeth or shaving and whatnot it repeats \"Oh yeah fucking right Peter Thompson\".  It is hell but if I read, like my Bible or watch YouTube videos the voices stop so I am busy learning about what it is to be a Targeted Individual and the technologies employed as well as the lexicon.  I have been reading The Bible though and trying to keep my faith strong.  I have also been watching sermons by Charles Lawson whom my brother recommended and is a great Pastor.  I am doing the best I can as a TI : Targeted Individual and I think I became targeted because of my lower-class as well as the fact I'm on Disability and my past computing perhaps but definitely because I am poor and on Disability although the v2k lies and says it is for this and that reason.  They never attack the wealthy.",
