Nazg\u00fbl, penetration, Nazg\u00fbl, full penetration, Nazg\u00fbl, penetration. And this goes on and on, and back and forth, for 180 or so minutes until the movie just, sort of, ends.\u201d",

No punchline about an ironic title or anything.\n\n\nAny time a character describes an idea for a filthy movie does NOT an Aristocrats reference make, that's like saying any time a character walks across the street it's a \"chicken crosses the road\" reference.",

He\u2019s got some sneakers he\u2019s merchandising in the middle.\u00a0 \u2026 \\[W\\]e don\u2019t understand a word Boorman wrote.\u00a0 We never read the books.\u2019\u00a0(Robinson 4)\n\nIt was only 176 pages, and there weren\u2019t any sneakers, but it wouldn\u2019t have helped to have read the books, because Boorman took off in his own direction quite early in his treatment.\u00a0\n\nTo put it bluntly, Boorman\u2019s script has only the vaguest connection to Tolkien\u2019s\u00a0The Lord of the Rings. Considering Tolkien\u2019s appalled reaction to the much lesser liberties taken by Zimmerman, it is unlikely he would have appreciated Boorman\u2019s script at all. \u00a0Characters, events, locations, themes, all are changed freely with no regard for the author\u2019s original intent. Situations are sexualized or plumbed for psychological kinks that simply do not exist in the book. (Tolkien would not have approved of Frodo\u2019s seduction by Galadriel, for example, and Aragon\u2019s battlefield healing of \u00c9owyn is so blatantly sexual it\u2019s not surprising Boorman marries them immediately.) Ideas that later worked brilliantly in\u00a0Excalibur, Boorman\u2019s retelling of the King Arthur legend, are here as out of place as a dwarf in Lothl\u00f3rien.\n\nBoorman was simply too full of his own creative spark to limit himself to what was in Tolkien\u2019s book.\u00a0 For example, consider this strange sequence of events.\u00a0 After the destruction of the Ringwraiths at the Fords of Bruinen, Frodo is carried into the sparkling palace of Rivendell, where in a vast amphitheatre full of chanting elves **he is laid naked** on a crystal table and covered with green leaves. A **thirteen-year-old Arwen** surgically removes the Morgul-blade fragment from his shoulder with a red-hot knife under the threatening axe of Gimli, while Gandalf dares Boromir to try to take the Ring\u00a0(Boorman and Pallenberg 28-32).\n\nSound familiar?\u00a0 How about this sequence outside the Gates of Moria? Gandalf leads Gimli through a primitive rebirthing ritual, making him dig a hole and crawl into it, covering him with a cloak and violently beating and verbally abusing him, until he springs forth with recovered memories of his forgotten ancestral language and speaks the Dwarvish words needed to open the doors\u00a0(Boorman and Pallenberg 59-60).\"",

But because the history is so popular globally, there's a huge tourist trade and so high demand for historic reenactments. MC is a shield-maiden in the shows and wishes she was born back in the day to be a real knight. Her grandpa who was young enough to be a squire in the final war tells her she's crazy and shield maidens were ceremonial honor guards and almost never on the battlefield. \n\nAs you can imagine, what comes next is a mogul at industrial sprites and magic discovering the grimoire of a prior dark lord and thinking he can get it eight where all the others got it wrong. And he screws up big-time. And now our shield-maiden gets what she wanted in the worst way. How to defeat the dark lord without killing her friends who are now enthralled by dark magic?",

For who of the living has descended into the pits of Utumno, or has explored the darkness of the counsels of Melkor? Yet this is held true by the wise of Eress\u00eba, that all those of the Quendi who came into the hands of Melkor, ere Utumno was broken, were put there in prison, and by slow arts of cruelty were corrupted and enslaved; and thus did Melkor breed the hideous race of the Orcs in envy and mockery of the Elves, of whom they were afterwards the bitterest foes. For the Orcs had life and multiplied after the manner of the Children of Il\u00favatar; and naught that had life of its own, nor the semblance of life, could ever Melkor make since his rebellion in the Ainulindal\u00eb before the Beginning: so say the wise. And deep in their dark hearts the Orcs loathed the Master whom they served in fear, the maker only of their misery. This it may be was the vilest deed of Melkor, and the most hateful to Il\u00favatar.\n\nJRR Tolkien, The Silmarillion, Quenta Silmarillion, \u201cOf the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor\u201d\n\n\n\n> \u201c\u2026Eru would not sanction the work of Melkor so as to allow the independence of the Orcs. (Not unless Orcs were ultimately remediable, or could be amended and \u2018saved\u2019?).\u201d \n\n>  \u201cThey might have become irredeemable (at least by Elves and Men), but they remained within the Law.\u201d\n\nTolkien Essays, texts 7 and 10. \n\n\nAll of this indicates something he wrestled with over the course of his writings, and leads to being unwilling to have the idea of a race that was irredeemable by the supernatural powers.  \n\n\nSo, while I agree that the orcs flipping to good after Sauron dies is a bit of a stretch, it\u2019s not to the same level as the other things described.  It\u2019s a textual violation, but not one that goes against the spirit of the work, unlike Frodo and Galadriel getting it on.",

The show has little to do with the books (and less by the minute) but it\u2019s still a pretty good show and I don\u2019t think a more accurate version would be.  I also don\u2019t think the writers were completely hostile to the basic ideas from the books either (looking at you, rings of power). \n\n\nIn contrast I think the lotr trilogy is *incredibly* suited to a three film adaptation.  It is a super straightforward story following the same small group of characters, there are only ever like two narrative strands happening simultaneously, it\u2019s not dense and complex even as it gives the sense of a deeper world, it\u2019s sort of episodic in that there\u2019s a lot you can cut without changing the plot at all (rip Bombadil, but did his absence change *anything*), and the books split into movies perfectly. \n\nThe hobbit also works perfectly as a single film, but was stretched beyond recognition to fill 10 hours of cinema via a book that takes like 2.5 hours to read.",

WoT is popular, but it doesn\u2019t have enough fans that appealing to them might be enough to carry the show.  They used WoT as inspiration for a fantasy show that general audiences might like, they were not bringing a beloved story to life that everyone already wanted to see beforehand. Lotr exists on a very different level in terms of popularity and exposure.  The demand exists for a very faithful lotr adaptation, I really doubt it does for WoT",

They were a bit plagued with issues though - one of the main actors in season 1 quit partway through so they had to change his story last minute which threw a wrench in a few other plot lines, and then COVID hit during filming. The seasons weren\u2019t BAD in my opinion, but they weren\u2019t a faithful adaption of the source material.\n\nSeason 3\u2019s episodes seem to be very good all around so far though. The first 3 episodes of the season are probably the best episodes of the entire series. I think they\u2019re trying to course correct to get back on track with the book, so we\u2019ll see how it goes.\n\nThis is Reddit, however, so r/wheeloftime predictably isn\u2019t very warm on the series.",

I like it overall. \n\nI think a lot of the hate results from the rearrangement required by the fact that faithfully adapting a book a season would be hard enough given there\u2019s 14 books. They\u2019re trying to cover the same stuff in like 8 seasons. There\u2019s definitely some changes I think are unnecessary (the books are clear that the chosen hero must be male, while the show says it could be a man or woman), but others I think make sense. \n\nFor example, one of the main characters gets a wife who is killed almost immediately in the show, while in the book he\u2019s just single. The showrunner explained this change as giving a physical reason for that character\u2019s pacifism, as in the book a lot of his motivations are from inner dialogue that doesn\u2019t translate well to a show. People hate it because it seems unnecessary but it\u2019s really not a big deal. \n\nOther problems are the weird romances that build out of nowhere, but the books have the same problem and people kinda just gloss over it. The romances only really matter as a plot device for why someone acts in service of another. \n\nWhile the wheel of time subreddit hates the show, they would also have to admit that the books have some weird choices and repeating plots. Like getting a macguffin in book 3 that is then unused until like book 9 except as a \u201cwhat if\u201d option that gets repeatedly considered. It\u2019s like a chekovs gun that they keep bringing up but never firing. Or simply having multiple books each about finding the next macguffin like we\u2019re collecting pieces of the fucking triforce to beat ganandorf. \n\nPerhaps the hardest part of the show is keeping track of who everybody is, and the simplest recommendation I have is to only keep track of the original characters from the shire (sorry, two rivers). There\u2019s a lot of scheming and betraying but the original characters always have each others back and have clearer intentions so it\u2019s easier to follow them. Other characters are much harder to understand as friend or foe (intentionally so).",

While The Joker film is an example of Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix wanting to do a case study of someone with psychosis and not having their own ability to create an original story based on their idea, so they co-op a popular character and use them to do what they want without really caring about the source material.",
