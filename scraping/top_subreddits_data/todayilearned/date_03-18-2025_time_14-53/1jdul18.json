They were referred to in court as Fernando and Fabr\u00edcio.  \n\"One of them is acting in bad faith in order to hide the fact that he is the father. Such vile behaviour cannot be tolerated by the law,\" wrote the judge in the town of Cachoeira Alta.  \nThe judge said the twins had used their resemblance to impersonate each other and date as many women as possible, and then defend themselves from allegations they were cheating on girlfriends.",

Fernando accused Fabr\u00edcio, who, in turn, insisted that Fernando was responsible.\n\nIt appears that while they were obviously not acting in good faith with the woman in question, one of the parties is, indeed, \"Innocent\" and has no way to get out of the punishment short of convincing his brother to admit guilt.\n\nIt's probably the right ruling in this case considering that the brothers seem to frequently use each other's identity, but I can easily imagine a similar case where where one brother's identity is (possibly) stolen without consent, and it'd be kind of fucked up to punish both of them when you can't prove which one committed the crime.",

It very much does, it just doesn\u2019t show 100% that they are. \n\nIt just doesn\u2019t show which one out of the two is more likely. \n\nSo follow my example above. There\u2019s two court cases. Each one would show that they are more likely than not to be the father correct? \n\nNow there\u2019s a third court case, if you\u2019re the judge what do you do? Because you can\u2019t just strip the child of the money knowing that these two conspired to commit the fraud. So if you can\u2019t just strip it in the name of justice you have to get their cooperation. And if they don\u2019t cooperate then the case is at a standstill and they both keep paying until the case can be resolved.\n\nThe judge was essentially playing that out. \n\nYou can think of it in many ways. One is being held liable for child support and one is paying a monthly fine for conspiracy to commit fraud. Or you could say that the child is due support from their father and both men have claimed to be each other in the past so they are just paying the consequences for that fraud \n\n\n\nIs your argument that it\u2019s not legal? Cause if so I\u2019d be curious to see if it was overturned cause I\u2019m sure the twins tried to overturn it. \n\nIs your argument that it\u2019s not just? If so then I\u2019d strongly disagree.\n\nAre you just curious what the legal rational is? That\u2019s been answered by many people including the judge\n\nAre you just curious the exact wording of the law? If so you probably have to find a lawyer from Brazil to tell you that.",

The courts do and it wasn\u2019t overturned so there\u2019s no reason to think it\u2019s not legal. Haha. So to answer your question again, the courts know. \n\nSo in my questions you just want to know the exact legal code in Brazilian law? That\u2019s a weirdly specific thing for a random Redditor to want. Are you connected to Brazil? Like do you want to be a lawyer there? I\u2019m just curious why you are so curious about such a very specific detail of this case. We already know it\u2019s legal and we know the reasoning, wanting the exact wording of the law is odd to be honest\n\nAnd we have seen a preponderance of evidence. You are confused",

The fact that he has a twin is obviously a factor that affects whether a goddamn DNA test can implicate him, haha Jesus Christ dude. Just look up basically any other legal case involving twins, there are a surprising number of them. \n\nI don\u2019t know how you\u2019re so dense\u2026 obviously a DNA shows a 99.99% that ONE of the brothers is the father. Clearly there isn\u2019t a 99.99% chance that BOTH are the father now is it\u2026 so clearly you cannot say on the preponderance of the evidence that either are more likely to be the father. The evidence merely shows (beyond a reasonable doubt) that ONE of them is the father haha",

If you are investigating a crime you bring in many suspects, and you figure out which ones it's probable did the crime, you narrow the list down. Often there are two suspects that you think are more likely than not to have commited the crime. what you then do is get more evidence to find out beyond a reasonable doubt sho did the crime. \n\nIt actually does matter who she brought the case against. If she brought it against one twin then how did the other twi get involved? Did the first twin say that its probable that the other twin is the parent? \n\nIts probable that either twin is the parent, its not probable that both are the parent but no one made that claim. Its probable that twin 1 is the parent and its probable that twin b is the parent.  \n\nlikely doens't mean 100% more likely than not doesn't mean you know for sure. you are acting like a prick and its funny cause you are misunderstanding that term. \n\nIt's even funnier because I know more details about this but since you refuse to answer ny question I'm not sharing those with you.

Basically he says that the DNA evidence narrows the possible paternity down to one of them, and that the one who's not the father is deliberately acting in bad faith to try and benefit the other who has no problem with it, and in doing so they are denying the child her constitutionally protected right of knowing their parentage and having their needs met by their family. Brazilian law explicitly doesn't allow a person to benefit from their misdeeds due to a loophole, giving a judge the latitude for an unorthodox decision such as this one. \n\nHaving said that, one of the brothers did appeal and the sentence was overturned, with the appeal court ordering that a more advanced (and expensive) test be done which has a better chance of saying who the actual father is. I couldn't find any other updates about what happened after that, unfortunately.",

Often the counter argument is \"but it wasn't the child's choice to be created\" and while that's true, it's also not the choice of someone that isn't the parent ...so why punish him (and yes, it's always a guy that gets inappropriately punished like this for obvious reasons)?",

I'm not going to pay for other people's kids so bros can go bust multiple nuts around town without consequences just because they forgot that the intended purpose is for procreation.  Maybe you are that charitable to pick up the tab, but not me.  And that's why judges make unwilling fathers pay child support: not cause they hate men \u2014 especially when a lot of judges are men \u2014 but because they're looking out for the taxpayers.  The facts are when you release your sperm into someone's body, you no longer have a say over it because it's not in you.  Don't deposit it into someone if you want 100% control over what's done with it.  I love casual sex just like anyone, but it's why I have standards and why I would never sleep with someone I wouldn't plan to be with long term.

It also has a lower standard of evidence, so a not-guilty verdict in criminal trial doesn't equate to a not-liable verdict in civil trial. Sometimes, a not-guilty verdict is followed up with a liable verdict.\n\nedit: also, off the top of my head, look at Summer v. Tice for that kind of liability.

In that case, it is the case that they've both breached their duty of care, so to speak. \n\nIf it's really the case that one of them can reliably show that he didn't have sex with her during the timeframe that would lead to the particular pregnancy, then yeah that brother should prove his case and not be assigned liability. \n\nIf the record shows that they both did the woohoo with her during that timeframe, alternative liability looks pretty on-point. \n\nNow I understand this necessarily causes us to ask \"what was the duty that was breached?\" and admittedly the best answer I can come up with is like... the duty to not father an illegitimate child I guess? But \"duty\" is often a strange concept anyway. I think this would fit pretty well under alternative liability under the assumption they both coulda done it. \n\nAnd we can disagree.

It sounds like it's more effort than it is to secretly keep some girls on the side.\n\nSo yea they probably used their likeness as plausible deniability in case they were ever caught cheating. I suppose the twins figured that if the court can't prove who is the real father, then none of them could be compelled to pay child support.

If you choose to go home with someone because they say they're a lion tamer and that impresses you, you have been deceived but not deceived into having sex. You are aware of all the facts around the decision to have sex, including the fact that people are often deceitful and they probably aren't really a lion tamer. But if in the middle of sex a third person switches places with them without your knowledge that isn't consensual (even though you carried on) because you didn't have all the facts necessary to give consent.\n\nIt is not the scale of the lie that is the issue, it is the scope of the consequences of the lie. Being a lion tamer did not change the nature of the consent, being a completely different person does. There are some situations where the area between the two can be blurry, like in the UK when an undercover police officer spent months building up a relationship (which became sexual) with a member of an organisation being investigated. But your argument that deceit alone **never** rises to the level of rape because the victim believed they were consenting at the time is false.",

Here's a real life scenario in the u.s.: a cop stops a car with 4 people in it. The driver agrees to a search and the cop finds a small amount of cocaine that someone clearly had on them. All 3 deny it is theirs. The cops knows one of them is guilty so he arrests all 3 under reasonable suspicion for the same crime and says 'let the courts figure it out'.\n\n\nThat shit is totally legal, even though we know perfectly well that two of those people are innocent.\n\n\nShould it be? Many would argue it definitely shouldn't. Realistically you could end up with all 3 being found guilty for the same crime just as much as none of them being found guilty.\n\n\nThe situation you are describing would be 'ideal', but then you think of it in the existing scenario- these guys having a permanent plausible deniability from any kind of DNA evidence which would just be insanity. Not to mention, there actions clearly show that intentionally exploiting these social norms was fully intentional on both of theirs parts- so regardless of who is the directly responsible one, the other is undeniably an accessory to the fraud. The most reasonable thing is to let them split the damage. If they think that isn't fair, the 'real' innocent party can take his brother to court in a civil case and argue his innocence there to be recompensated for the other having dragged them into the paternity drama.",

Yes you could argue that they could just take their own DNA test but sometimes that's not enough. Doctors will constantly ask people what their history is and not knowing that could end up meaning they won't be able to catch something that they could have caught earlier. \n\nThe point is not so that they are contacted. S these places typically do not make any obligation for the donor to have any contact with the person. No, again it has to do with things like medical conditions and stuff like that. \n\nThese are a few of the different types of conditions that can come up that are genetically linked but they wouldn't necessarily come up in DNA tests such as 23andMe or something like that. So these things are genetic but they're not able to be detected by current technology because we don't know exactly what to look for in the DNA sequencing but we do know that they have a genetic component to them. It's a lot easier to just use family history.\n\n1. **Autoimmune Disorders**  \n   *Examples:* Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or multiple sclerosis. These involve genetic susceptibility but are heavily influenced by environmental triggers and immune dysregulation not captured by genetic screens.\n\n2. **Mental Health Conditions**  \n   *Examples:* Major depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. While there may be genetic links, diagnosis relies on clinical evaluation, not genetic testing.\n\n3. **Severe Allergies**  \n   *Examples:* Anaphylactic reactions to foods (e.g., peanuts), drugs (e.g., penicillin), or environmental allergens. These are not genetically determined in a predictable way.\n\n4. **Asthma**  \n   Often triggered by environmental factors (e.g., pollution, smoking) alongside genetic predisposition, but not directly testable via DNA kits.\n\n5. **Type 2 Diabetes**  \n   Strongly linked to lifestyle factors (diet, exercise) and family history, but not solely attributable to specific genetic markers.\n\n6. **Migraines (with aura or chronic)**  \n   Familial patterns exist, but no definitive genetic test is available through consumer kits.\n\n7. **Epilepsy (non-genetic causes)**  \n   If caused by trauma, infection, or unknown triggers, this wouldn\u2019t appear on genetic tests but is critical for neurological monitoring.\n\n8. **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)**  \n   *Examples:* Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis. These involve gene-environment interactions not fully captured by DNA tests.\n\n9. **Environmental or Lifestyle-Induced Cancers**  \n   *Examples:* Lung cancer from smoking or liver cancer from chronic hepatitis. Family history of such cancers highlights environmental risks.\n\n10. **Hormonal Disorders**  \n    *Examples:* Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or hypothyroidism. These are multifactorial and often require clinical diagnosis.\n\n11. **History of Pregnancy Complications**  \n    *Examples:* Preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, or recurrent miscarriages. These may signal risks for the child\u2019s prenatal or long-term health.\n\n12. **Nutritional Deficiencies**  \n    *Examples:* Severe anemia (iron/B12 deficiency) or rickets (vitamin D deficiency). These stem from dietary or absorption issues, not genetic mutations.\n\n**Why These Matter:**  \nThese conditions can influence a child\u2019s risk assessment, preventive care, or early diagnosis. For example, a parent\u2019s autoimmune disease might prompt monitoring for similar symptoms in the child, while a history of mental health issues could guide developmental screenings. Always share family medical history with healthcare providers, as DNA tests alone miss critical contextual information.",

The article is pretty vague, though.\n\n(Beyond that the issue, which is usually the case in child support cases, is that child support is a right of the child. That means the law leans towards finding a way to grant it if at all possible - if it's a choice between burdening a potentially innocent adult or a definitely innocent child, the law will choose the adult, who at least has some responsibility for their actions. And ofc while I don't know about Brazil, if this had taken place under US law it would be a civil matter and therefore subject to a standard of \"preponderance of evidence\" and not \"reasonable doubt / innocent until guilty.\")",

She then switched her dead baby with the living one, claiming it as her own.
