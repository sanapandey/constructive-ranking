Going by one value of a ton of iron I found (63.73 dollars) in 1775, that would cost $0.382. Sounds cheap, but that was when a dollar a day was considered a decent daily wage for an unskilled adult laborer. \n\nOther prices I've seen are 14 pounds for a ton of iron in the late 1600s/early 1700s, when a typical wage was around 75 pence a week. I find it believable that desperate kids would try to find scrap iron and sell it for food, especially with the sad state of orphan care in those eras.\n\nOne kid finds a cannonball while swimming, sells it, and the tale starts from there, is my guess for how that rumor was started.",
