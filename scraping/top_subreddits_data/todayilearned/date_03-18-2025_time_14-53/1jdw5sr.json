Some animals are prohibited rabbinically and others biblically. Among the biblically prohibited animals, the penalties are also different. Eating seafood for instance bears the punishment of \"Karet\", the most severe punishment, a type of excommunication of the soul. \n\nThus even in cases of immediate threat to life, decisions should be made as to which laws are to be broken.",

John the Baptist was said to have survived on locusts and honey in the Christian gospels. Despite this, later Rabbinic traditions would further codify dietary restrictions and some would come to include locusts as unclean. However, Jewish communities where eating locusts was important for survival would continue to eat locusts and they considered those locusts kosher. Currently, traditions around locusts are kind of up in the air but there is a general category of \"Kosher Locusts\" which have become accepted as kosher by the wider Jewish community.",

Several attempts were made by early Zionists to enable this under Arab rule. This failed due to their neighbors murdering them, and a general unwillingness to allow Jews to coexist as equals, only as Dhimmi.\n\nThe only other acceptable definition of Zionism is the belief that Israel should continue to exist. \n\nBeing against the continuing existence of Israel is not inherently antisemitic. But being against the continuing existence of Israel AND advocating for its end without a clear plan for the evacuation and resettlement of 10 million people, including half of all Jews on the planet, is, as you are then calling for the genocide of half of world Jewry, and, specifically, the eradication of Mizrachi and Beta Israel Jewry. (What is the issue so many seem to have with Black and Brown Jews existing?) In addition to also calling for the genocide of multiple non-Jewish ethnic groups, several of whom only exist, or primarily exist, in Israel, and who would be eradicated should the State fall. \n\nEvery other definition of Zionism can be traced back to Stalin and David Duke, and are thus invalid, as their definitions were invented to encourage antisemitism. Anyone using those definitions has outed themselves as either a Far Right Supremacist fan of the KKK, or a Stalinist in the vein of Putin, or both. Either way, not worth acknowledging.\n\nWhat you\u2019re probably thinking of when you say \u201cZionism\u201d is Kahanism. Kahanism is terrorism, and hate. Deplore it all you like.

That and them trying to get him stoned (and later crucified) for things he said in their synagogues.",

For Gentiles, they kept the prohibitions on blood, blood tainted meat, animals that were strangled and food that was offered to idols. That decision was officially revoked in the 15th century and likely not actually adhered to in Europe long before then. Jews who were part of the Jesus movement were still expected to keep all of the laws. \n\nJewish Christians such as the Ebionites were a major factor in the early Christian movement. They did not believe Jesus was divine and rejected Paul as an apostate. However, the destruction of the temple scattered their population throughout Rome and it is assumed most integrated into Christian and Jewish communities. There are attestations of Ebionite communities surviving as late as the 7th century.",

A taboo against _uncooked_ pork would be equally effective.\n\n\nThe leading theory among scholars nowadays is that it is a cultural taboo. Pigs thrive in urban environments, where they have a double function of waste disposal and food source. The Philistines and other traditional enemies of the Canaanite peoples lived in large cities and tended to eat pork and sacrifice pigs in religious rituals. The Hebrews decend from pastoral and nomadic Canaanite peoples who did not live in cities and largely depended on goats and other grazing animals for proteins. The taboo against pork became an effective way to distinguish themselves from other cultural groups (we aren't like those filthy pig eaters. If you eat pork you might as well be one of them). This also explains many other taboos e.g. those against cutting your sideburns, tattoos, piercings, shellfish etc.",

If the taboo was pragmatic, the Philistines wouldn't have farmed so many pigs either.\n\n\nI'm not aware of any non-Abrahamic religions or cultures with taboos against shellfish either. Unless the Hebrews were particularly prone to shellfish allergies, why would no other cultures take the same precautions?\n\n\nThe belief that the laws in the Torah are pragmatic stems from the belief that they are divinely inspired, and thus they cannot be arbitrary, but rather they should indicate advanced knowledge that was not available to other cultures at the time. People like David Macht first proposed these ideas as evidence that the Bible is a reliable source for medicine.",

That being said, many muslims don't necessarily eat halal only, as there are many schools of Islam and what constitutes halal. In my country, Turkish muslims just avoid pork, slaughter the \"correct\" way when having their own meat, but don't avoid regular meats. This is because being part of their local community is placed higher than halal slaughter rules, and you can't be part of the community if you don't eat together. \n\nI know we think of the most orthodox and Sharia law country rules for muslims, but they're a world huge religion with multiple interpretations and many chill followers. \n\nBtw props on thinking up the name, I had to double check my phone thinking it broke lol.",
