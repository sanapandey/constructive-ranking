First off all the production for war had been switched to the cities disguised in housing. The Japanese were ruthless to a point that even the Germans thought they had no soul. They had a 75% to 95% mortality rate in prisoner camps. They were hellbent on genocide and world domination that they had absolutely no ability to enact but they would try forever to do it until their god emperor was forced to tell them to stop. \n\n\n\nYou seem quite naive in all matters regarding this matter so I won\u2019t waste too much fingertips on you, you sound like after a high schooler reads the communist manifesto and takes their first social studies class. Maybe you took one philosophy class in college. \n\n\n\nThey invited the Japanese to see them drop the bomb, they dropped the first one in Hiroshima after a 3 day campaign dropping leaflets all over the city warning them to evacuate. They then dropped leaflets on Nagasaki telling them to evacuate and then bombed it 3 days later after an extensive radio campaign telling them to leave. The emperor told them to hold strong and continue to fight, despite having witnessed the destruction of the first city. \n\n\n\n\nThe only other options were to fire bomb the cities which was orders of magnitudes more cruel and painful. Everyone running in terror and watching everything around them burn for hours and days\u2026much more horrible. \n\n\n\nThere was no \u201cbetter\u201d solution, everything had a horrible price to pay and had horrific consequences. I know with all of your ideals you think they could have hugged it out, but they could not at all. I can not state this enough, \u2026..::The Japanese pride and zealotry had never been seen in any people to this magnitude before, and their savagery and cruelty has never been outdone in all of history. The stuff they were doing to Koreans and Chinese was so much worse than even what the Germans did to the Jews.\n\n\n\n\nThen it brings us to the final argument for the bomb. Russia was our \u201cally\u201d in the fight but in no way did they have any other ambitions different from the nazis and Japanese, and they were just as genocidal and bloodlusted for world domination. The bomb had to be dropped in order to tell the Russians with a very firm message that they were to stop all conquest attempts and the United States was not to be trifled with.",

Suing for peace is a negotiation of terms of surrender. Both would be a victory, but there was concerns that a surrender with terms involved would allow Japan to bide their time and build back up their navy, akin to what happened in Germany between WW1 and WW2.\n\nBut also, we definitely wanted to spook the Soviets, prevent Japan from being under split control like Germany was, make sure the billions we spent on the Manhattan Project didn't \"go to waste\" in some people's eyes, and just generally make the American people feel like we had more power than the rest of the world. In all of those, dropping the bombs succeeded.

And Reddit has a bigger problem with the cultural misunderstanding of cease fire and surrender.\n\n1) The USSR was being used as a back channel for a cease fire and surrender. They were working with Japan in this role before Pearl Habor.\n\n2) Pearl Harbor was a Hail Mary play to beat America to a point of cease fire *not* surrender.  A \"bloody nose attack\" so that America doesn't attempt to liberate the Phillipines, which was invaded immediately after.\n\n3) Japan wanted to surrender for months before the nukes were dropped. They were trying to send out feelers through the USSR since the Battle of Saipan long before the invasion of Okinawa. They just had ridiculous conditions around it. It was obvious to anyone paying attention that they hadn't thought it through and were trying to commit seppuku with American bayonets.\n\n4) The Big 6 who were running the show couldn't surrender if they wanted to. They were stuck in an impasse. They were suicidal in their defiance. It was for the Allies to walk them back from the ledge if they didn't want that to happen. Remember there was a palace coup in the end.\n\n5) America and Japan had wildly different negotiating styles. The Japanese have very a formal negotiation style that the diplomats on both sides were begging them to try. \"Enryo\" and \"Wa\" mean a lot to the Japanese. They use bulldozer tactics in negotiation so that there is never a \"win-win\" or compromise on the surface of things. It begins with one side making the other the submssive party even if just in looks. Japan would have surrendered months earlier if America let them pretend that they won. \"Okay, Japan you are far to mighty. Let us end this war on your terms\". Then America sends over the terms of Japan's surrender. Then Japan says \"deal, we'll show you mercy\".\n\n6) This would allow for a cease fire months before a formal surrender. Remember that America demanded an unconditional surrender. Loud and broadcast. That wouldn't allow Japan to walk back from the ledge. It wouldn't allow for the \"face\" that Japan needed to not kill their negotiators looking to desperate.\n\n7) The USSR declared war on Japan ending the back channel. They couldn't surrender on \"their\" terms. Then they put another star in the sky....twice....in the same week. And the Japanese had no idea what the hell happened in Hiroshima. It took days to just corroborate the intelligence. They had no idea a nuclear bomb was possible. They just had listening stations all around it explain what they saw. The big 6 couldn't agree on what to do or what it meant.\n\n8) America dropped a second bomb because it had a second bomb. They had a different design and needed to test it. And wanted the Soviets to see it.\n\n9) Stalin knew what the Japanese wanted but didn't want to give up his negotiating leverage against them, or the allies. He could have forced a cease fire or surrender after VE day. When the Allies started hitting the home islands but were keeping troops in Germany, he saw the writing on the wall and forced their hand.\n\n10) The only real condition that Japan wanted was immunity for Hirohito and the throne. America said \"no conditions\" and meant it. However they never tried the emperor for war crimes *anyway*. This could have sped that along by weeks and saved tens of thousands of lives.",

It was only possible to make the US citizens content and the japanese scared with a strike so strong that no retaliation was possible, and a lot of US ships were destroyed by Kamikaze planes, which made reaching Japan extremely difficult. At that time the atomic bomb was a still a card on USA's sleeve that turned into a war deterrent after being used to decimate Japan's fighting chance and up until now no one dares throw the next nuke because of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Which worked, people still are shocked at the idea of cities being instantly vaporized but the firestorms of Tokyo become footnotes in discussions of the horrors of that war. \n\nFeels like instead of hand wringing about using 1 plane to destroy a city or 1000 people should remember that once peace is shattered there's no hoping your enemy will have more honor than you've shown yourself to have.",

Frankly I never claimed that the Soviet invasion was the final cause. It\u2019s all cumulative. The question should really be \u201cWould the Japanese have surrendered if the nukes weren\u2019t dropped?\u201d. In my opinion, yes, obviously they would surrender regardless. There\u2019s lots of context though. Japan\u2019s war has been going on for 15 years. The government is, in practice, controlled by the six men of the Supreme War Direction Council. Six men with unknowable motivations, but no doubt aware of the real and present threat of political violence in Japan. These men presided over the overwhelming conventional bombing of Tokyo, the final destruction of the Japanese fleet, Chinese victories in Burma, Hunan, Guanxi, and the effective mining of *all of* Japan\u2019s harbors. (About that last one, Strategic Bombing Survey reports after the war suggest that the mining so effectively froze Japan\u2019s economy that on its own it could have affected the duration of the war.) Even after all that, there were still serious leaders on the council advocating a continuation of the war. The six men of the council were, by this point, largely divided into two camps, those who wanted to fight one last battle, so costly the Allies would never accept the price, and those who wanted Stalin to mediate a peace between the powers. The Japanese government is completely paralyzed politically and economically, with no strategic option left but to sacrifice so many, that their enemies tire of killing. On August 6th, Hiroshima was, like many Japanese cities at this point, devastatingly bombed and left burning. On the 8th the Soviet Union, Japan\u2019s last hope of outside mediation, declared war, they commenced their invasion of Manchuria the morning of the 9th. Only a few hours later, Nagasaki was struck with the second bomb. It isn\u2019t until the 14th, when the destruction of Japan\u2019s last serious field army reserves was well underway in Manchuria, that Emperor Hirohito breaks the council\u2019s deadlock and instructs them to accept the allied terms. There are just so so so many reasons for Japan to surrender. With the force arrayed against Japan by mid August, it would not only be infeasible but politically untenable to continue subjecting the people of Japan to the sacrifice of total war. I\u2019m pretty skeptical that you can point to any one event as *the* cause for surrender. The Soviets are BIG part of it, but not really for their military contribution.",

I suggested that the impact of the bombs was not really greater than the already extensive conventional bombing campaign. This is important because the next question I posed was whether or not the bombs were necessary to bring about Japanese surrender. I don't believe they were. However, I do believe that the Soviet Invasion, in eliminating the last card Japan had to play, definitely was necessary to bringing about the surrender when and how it happened. Summary: If there were no nukes, but the soviets still invaded and all else remains the same, the Japanese are forced to surrender unconditionally, having no more options. If there were nukes, but no Soviet invasion, the Japanese potentially hold out for a third-party mediation. Considering the previously mentioned fact that the conventional bombing campaign was far more destructive to far more important parts of Japan, why should I expect two more medium sized cities burning to, individually, push the Japanese high council to surrender? You talk about the horror of nuclear bombs, what do the councilors know of that? They weren't there.",

But it dose say that the enemy has developed a new bomb whose power of destruction is unknown. Don't belive me here.\n\nI have considered deeply the general trends of the world and the current situation of the Empire, and I have decided to take extraordinary measures to bring the current state of affairs to an end. I hereby inform my loyal and devoted subjects.\n\nI have commanded the Imperial Government to communicate to the governments of the United States, Great Britain, China, and the Soviet Union that the Empire accepts the terms of their Joint Declaration.\n\nTo strive for the well-being of my subjects and to share in the prosperity and happiness of all nations has been the solemn duty passed down from my Imperial ancestors and the guiding principle that I have upheld. Indeed, my decision to declare war on the United States and Britain was made with the sincere intention of ensuring the Empire\u2019s self-preservation and the stability of East Asia. It was never my desire to infringe upon the sovereignty of other nations or to expand our territory.\n\nHowever, after four years of war, despite the valiant efforts of our land and naval forces, the diligence of our government officials, and the devoted service of our hundred million subjects, the war situation has not necessarily turned in Japan\u2019s favor. Moreover, the general trends of the world have not been advantageous to us.\n\nFurthermore, the enemy has begun to employ a new and cruel bomb, causing immense and indiscriminate destruction, the extent of which is beyond all estimation. Should we continue to fight, not only would it result in the ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but it would also lead to the total extinction of human civilization.\n\nHow, then, am I to protect the millions of my subjects and atone before the spirits of my Imperial ancestors?\n\nThis is why I have ordered the Empire to accept the terms of the Joint Declaration.\n\nI cannot but express my deepest regret to our allied nations who have consistently cooperated with the Empire in its efforts to liberate East Asia.\n\nTo my loyal subjects who have fallen in battle, those who have devoted themselves to their duties, and the families who have suffered unbearable losses, my heart is filled with sorrow.\n\nFurthermore, I deeply sympathize with those who have been wounded in battle, suffered hardship, or lost their homes and livelihoods due to the war.\n\nThe trials and suffering that the Empire must endure from now on will indeed be great. I fully understand the anguish of my people. However, in accordance with the dictates of fate, I must bear the unbearable and endure the unendurable in order to pave the way for peace for all future generations.\n\nBy protecting and preserving the national polity, I trust in the sincerity and loyalty of my subjects and will always remain with them.\n\nHowever, should emotions run high and lead to rash actions, if fellow citizens turn against each other, disrupt the order of society, or tarnish the nation's honor by violating international trust, I would be profoundly saddened.\n\nI urge you, my subjects, to unite as one family, pass on our unshakable faith in the eternal destiny of our homeland to future generations, devote your efforts to rebuilding the nation, uphold moral integrity, strengthen your will, and strive to enhance the national character, ensuring that Japan does not fall behind in the progress of the world.\n\nUnderstand well my intentions and act accordingly.\n\nSealed with the Imperial Sign and Seal August 14, 1945\n\nPrime Minister Baron Kantar\u014d Suzuki",

The general standing with him had a huge smile on his face and told Maxim he had \"killed\" every single man and horse at the position, and that such a weapon would truly reinvent warfare.\n\nIt's funny that WWI would essentially be every side using various licence built Maxim's on one another.\n\nAll he ended up doing was creating a more efficient way to harvest meat.

He entered a weapon that he designed and built with assistance while recuperating in a competition. While he did not win the design competition, his design caught the attention of individuals and he was given the resources by the Soviet Union to develop what  ended up being the AK-47.\n\nOne of the important things about the AK was the fabrication techniques which were much simpler and less expensive than most modern weapons at the time. Using stamping as opposed to forging parts, for example. It is an incredible weapon. I faced them in RVN using the 16. I did see a 16 jam in a firefight one time, fwiw.\n\nAnother weapon designer that is worth reading about is J. Garrand of M1 fame.  He designed the M1 pretty much on his own time while working at the Springfield Armory. Much of the tooling that he designed and made to make the M1 actually ended being used in the final production process..  He was a brilliant individual. I saw a picture of him running a mill in the shop. Having been a wind tunnel model/engineering lab machinist, I can appreciate just how skilled he was.",

Kalashnikov first started working on his rifle in 1942, and the first rifle he produced that could be compared to the AK was in 1944. Well before the war was over. 1947 was simply the year that model was picked during military trials but still underwent heavy redesign during the production process.\n\nAnyone who claims the AK is a copy of the STG is not just a moron, they're a moron who doesn't know anything about firearms *or* firearms manufacturing.",

It's the world's most popular assault rifle. A weapon all fighters love. An elegantly simple 9 pound amalgamation of forged steel and plywood. It doesn't break, jam, or overheat. It will shoot whether it's covered in mud or filled with sand. It's so easy, even a child can use it; and they do. The Soviets put the gun on a coin. Mozambique put it on their flag. Since the end of the Cold War, the Kalashnikov has become the Russian people's greatest export. After that comes vodka, caviar, and suicidal novelists.

The AK-47 has been in constant usage since the late 40\u2019s. No artillery models from the First World War made it to the second (as far as I\u2019m aware). No one is saying artillery as a whole has killed less than assault rifles as a whole. But we\u2019re talking about specific weapons, not classes of weapons. \n\nAnd the AK-47 is unfortunately great when you want to wipe out a village or town full of people who don\u2019t fight back. It\u2019s a lot cheaper than explosives and much more efficient than edged weapons. Think of how many conflicts during the 20th century in Africa, where like 90% of fatalities were civilians, had the AK as the principal killing machine. When Saddam wiped out villages who conspired to kill him he sent in guys with AK\u2019s, not artillery. There\u2019s probably half a dozen 20th century genocides where the AK was the main tool for murder.\n\nAs to your point about the Ak-74, I don\u2019t think it really hit the export market as well as the 47 did. And most of the killing during the 20th century was not done by the Soviets, but rather people who got their hands on Soviet exports.",

Sell it in a batch for a few dollars each to someone else in Africa whose war was still going on? Destroy it? That wouldn't be easy. An AK was tough. That was why everyone wanted one, for this kind of war. It mightn't fire as quickly or as accurately as other guns, but long after those others had jammed or malfunctioned it would still be working. Daniel, who'd trained all the Warriors in the use of their weapons, had told them a story about a soldier who'd been wading through a marshy stream somewhere out west and had caught his foot in something buried in the mud. He found that the sling of an AK had tangled itself around his ankle. Somebody must have dropped it during the previous season's campaigning. With the mud and reed roots still clinging to it he'd cocked it, eased the safety, and pulled the trigger. The AK had fired.",

Why not use a gun that is so easy to use/reliable that you can teach a child to use it?

He didn't drop the bombs, but he helped make the design and the government actually used it. Also, Alred Nobel made the Nobel Prize because he invented dynamite (which he regretted) for all the death it caused.",
