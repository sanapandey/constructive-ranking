More than a month has passed since Kato, so those points have already decayed to something like 84% ish of what they were originally worth.",

I think people need to get comfortable with the overall vrs points as a cumulative whole rather than how much they \"win\" vrs points on a per match basis. As your not really playing for (net positive+) points every matchup but rather how it affects your overall vrs points count. if you have a 25 point decay as rate of decay and the match will only net you 24 then you still get those 24 (24Win - 25decay= -1 ) .but you can see how it might seem odd to lose points overall which i think could confuse some people",

They have a few large prize winnings that will age off around then ($32k on 2025-03-22, $40k on 2025-03-29) so I wonder if this kind of lose/lose appearance will show up more frequently just because Vitality has won so much money the aging factor works against them on any day they\u2019re not winning a tournament lol",

I think the highest we've seen on the current ranking model is about 2050.\n\nBut again, all other teams are scaled relative to the team that has the highest max average points. So if the team with 2000 becomes less dominant, other teams will get closer to them (by gaining points) while the #1 team is still 2000 - or gets overtaken by another, still weaker than previous team - who also starts with 2000 points.\n\nOf course after H2h is applied the teams can move up and down - in many cases the 2000 point team has been ranked #2 due to H2h elo dropping them down, but they're still the team everyone else is compared to.",

Due to their communication and playstyle issues, they always played textbook and left many gaps for Heroic's loose and aggressive style to exploit. You can go see the head to head record during that time to confirm this.\n\nThe problem for Astralis is that Vitality is no longer the same vulnerable team that they farmed before. Even towards the middle of 2023, Vitality finally got cohesive enough to beat Heroic before the whole Heroic drama happened. Now Vitality is twice as good, so I really don't see how Astralis can be competitive unless Vitality comes in cold or Astralis players life game against them.",

However, despite a drop in raw points, they still maintain their lead relative to their opponents. While relative points are difficult to illustrate, the TL;DR is that they are not losing their first-place position.\n\nThat said, a team losing raw points for a win is very unlikely to ever show up on an official Valve ranking update, as they will include many matches that have taken place since the last update, not just one match's impact. \n\nIt is fair to say that Valve never intended for HLTV, ESL, or others to create a prediction system that adds a single match onto the current state.",
