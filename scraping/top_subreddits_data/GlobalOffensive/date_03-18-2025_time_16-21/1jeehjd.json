They managed to beat the likes & favorites of Renegades & Cybergen. Both in a 2-0 fashion.\n\nSadly after qualifying issues occurred causing them to miss out of the major qualifications and being replaced by renegades.\n\nI wonder what would have happened if those issues didn\u2019t occurred. Would we have seen Mongolz more frequently? It\u2019s sad to have found out about this. \n\n\nhttps://www.hltv.org/news/17153/themongolz-to-miss-mlg-qualifier\n\n\n\n",
