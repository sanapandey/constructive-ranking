    "selftext": "After TYLOO won the last conventional round face-off FlyQuest, Jee cried in the interview. However, I think most of them know what things happened to Jee, let me tell the story that happened on him.  \n  \nWhen I first knew this guy, it was not because he is a pro cs player, but because he was from a caster called DGQ (in Chinese is called \u51ac\u74dc\u5f3a), the guy who found Jee. When DGQ first time found Jee, he just ran out of the academic team NH, and Jee just only 16 years old. At first, Jee did not want to be a pro player, even he is full of talent, and Jee is from a family that is not that rich. When Jee's family sent him to DGQ's studio (place to broadcast), his grandmother said\"I've entrusted him to you, please take good care of her for me\u201d. Meanwhile, DGQ is Jee's kind of godfather. At first, Jee was just a co-caster of DGQ studio, during that time. I watched DGQ's stream almost every day, and Jee is the guy that full of laughs. Until 2023, LVG need an AWPer to build a new roaster, the co-founder of LVG is a friend of DGQ, so DGQ just sent Jee to LVG. DGQ said \"I give you two years to be a pro player. If you don't feel happy during a pro player career, the studio still has your place. Try your best to earn the award and place in Chinese Counter-Strike.\" When Jee first time got into major, the same situation that happened on the interview too. But after they finished the first 2025 major journey, Jee decided to leave LVG and joint into TYLOO. It made one of the co-founders blame Jee as a traitor. One month ago before the EPL began, TYLOO lost all of the online regional play-in matches within three days, and Jee is the only \"new\" guy in TYLOO. Imagine the pressure he had, and the moment he finally qualified into Stage 2 to have a chance to face on the strongest team in the world. \n\nThe name \"Jee\" comes from his last name \"Ji\"(\u5b63), but mostly his ID read by Chinese caster are separate, it pronoun sounds like \"Go E E\", cuz the letter \"J' looks like a hook and the hook pronoun in Chinese is \"Gou(\u94a9)\". His signature of Stockholm Major was designed by DGQ's wife, which include one part of his first name inside the signature.\n\nHope it can help u guys know more about this \"cute\" players.",
