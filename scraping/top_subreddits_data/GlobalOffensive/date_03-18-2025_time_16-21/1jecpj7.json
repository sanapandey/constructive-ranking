But when I mention dupreeh, xyp and device being top 20 players before astralis era it is because it was the same core, even though they didnt have zonic at this point nor the same IGL, so how was it the same system? Just because it was the same 3 players? Then you have magisk, kjaerbye and gla1ve, all great players in their right without needing a system surrounding them to succeed, but apparently they only did good because of this system too and couldn't shine outside of it.",
