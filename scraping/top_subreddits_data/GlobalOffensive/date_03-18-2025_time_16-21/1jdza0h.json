                                                    "body": "\\> Ence removing Aleksi\n\nTotally reasonable at that time. Despite a good performance (making the playoffs) at the Berlin Major, 2019 was a much worse year for ENCE than 2018. Replacements in the lineup were needed, and AleksiB just \u201cdisappeared\u201d in matches against top-10 teams. With such a roster, ENCE could not count on regular playoff appearances. In 2018, suNNY had a good season with mousesports and was a clear improvement in terms of firepower over AleksiB.\n\n\\> G2 removing JKS\n\nTotally reasonable move as well. Just read his interview after IEM Dallas 2023. If a player thinks the roster is \u201cnot clicking\u201d and doesn't understand where to go next, replacing him is an expected move that will save time and resources for both the team and the player. Was the nexa choice a good one? No it wasn't, but we don't know why G2 picked him, but to say that replacing jks was stupid is just wrong.\n\n\\> Liquid removing twistzz\n\nAgain, totally reasonable move. However, and a bit controversial as well. Although the Canadian showed great play in 2019 and 2018 with an average rating above 1.15, in 2020, his rating dropped almost 0.1, especially in matches against top teams. In 2020, FalleN had a higher rating, more experience in different roles, and more desire to play too, as Twistzz was benched by mutual agreement with the team management. I don't see how this replacement can look bad.\n\nSo yeah... \"fcking stupid\" my ass.",

This lead to ence making this last minute change. However in finnish scene it was speculated that allu manipulated sergej to turn against aleksi, but no one really knows the real truth except players. Fact of the matter is that it was disastrous roster move and Ence management probably knew that beforehand but had no other choice as without allu and sergej the roster would have been dead anyway. \n\nNothing to really do with Aleksi's individual performance but a lot more to do with allu not liking Aleksi. It was just masked as benching due to individual performance to not look as bad as they were still overperforming with the team (reached major playoffs despite Aleksi knowing he is out).

It's the reason roles exist.\n\nI've thought about this before and I really think spirit is between a rock and a hard place.  Here's the breakdown.\n\nChopper - IGL, tough to replace\n\nDonk - Entry Rifler\n\nShiro - Awper, not replacing anytime soon\n\nZontix - Anchor\n\nMagixx - Role Player/Support\n\nThey're in a weird spot where structurally, they would benefit most by replacing magixx with (funny enough) a lurker like ropz.  But it's clear from the last major that Magixx can have a lot of impact.  Spirit wouldn't have won the major without Magixx having a life game.\n\nIt's not clear whether or not they would gain more by replacing either zontix or Magixx.  Zontix needs to be better on T side and is the clear player to play the lurk role, but he's just WAYYY to passive to have the impact they would need from someone in that role.  He's fine as an anchor, and he had a few great games at EPL, but we saw that it just wasn't enough for spirit to win.\n\nKyousuke might not be ready to play the lurk role and it would definitely be wrong to put him at the anchor position.\n\nIt almost makes more sense to let Magixx try to lurk or anchor just based on his experience, but I don't think Spirit is ready to turn in the card for their young talent zontix.  He's so young and really can grow more, but I just don't see his game  transitioning the way it needs to at the moment.\n\nIf I had to guess they'll get rid of Magixx if and when it happens, but I think his experience and support is far more valuable than the mediocre anchoring you get from zontixx.",

When you base your team's performance/success on one or two players shooting heads better than the other team, you will eventually run into a team that either outshoots you or outplays you with strats and util. Adding more firepower isn't always the right solution, especially when you take hits in other areas by doing so.\n\nAlso \"usually donk will get 2\" is just fantasy. He does not have 2KPR. Is he more likely than other players to get 2 per round? Sure. But it's still way lower than what you can rely on to win games consistently.",

                    "body": "The sentiment of Spirit needing to upgrade their firepower hasn't been something that arose from just this one best of 3. Changes for magixx/zont1x have been stirred by fans and talent alike for a while now.\n\nFrom having watched every single Spirit's match since Katowice 2024 through their lens (due to zont1x being my favorite player alongside donk), I think the following:\n\nSpirit is in a great position in terms of options, but in an awkward one, similar to that of FaZe 2023 (where one both thought there might be a need for a change but at the same time didn't know who to replace to truly improve instead of it just being a sidegrade), except unlike FaZe - this Spirit situation being a positive one, with them still being a top 2 team in the world and having other key differences.\n\nSpirit has a great academy system and potentially another prodigy soon to be entering the T1 scene in Kyosuke.\n\nThere has been chatter of m0NESY wanting to play on a CIS speaking team, and while Sh1ro's undeniably great - m0NESY's exceptional.\n\nEven small dread things feel like positive boons, such as the players other than donk knowing their positions (both magixx/zont1x I'm sure are aware they're not entirely irreplacable with new Spirit talent ala Kyosuke, and [Sh1ro knows all too well what someone just that bit better could come in](https://i.imgur.com/BeKt3r6.jpeg), similar to his situation with ArtFr0st, even though Artfr0st wasn't the problem either.)\n\nFor the awkward parts in all of this - replacing even a player like Magixx, a player who seems to be the most under the scope, is not that easy both because of his selfless roles and at times glimpses of great potential during his career, but possibly more important - the interactions seems to showcase him being the glue guy of the team. It would also be in bad taste if he wasn't on the team currently after his contributions during the Major. \n\nThen you have zont1x, a solid top 30 player last year who's only 19 and has shown to be quite cerebral, and from my understanding has a lot of ideas for the team, being the one closest to a second caller of the team.\n\nSh1ro - one would think irreplaceable in the context of everything due to his qualities, but if someone like m0NESY exists and Spirit wants to go the 'it's strict business' way about things, I wouldn't blade them for the move whatsoever. After all, it's potentially an era defining move.\n\nMost would agree that the current Spirit roster is likely to remain a top 2 team in the world, at bare minimum top 3 and possibly even number 1 if further showcases from Vitality get surmounted. Still, the main reason why a team of this caliber having so much talk about them in terms of needing changes comes from roughly the simple sentiment of - \"if Spirit is this good already with these pieces, with only one of 3 of chopper/magixx/zont1x needing to show up for Spirit to win everything... imagine if they had a genuine firepower upgrade with a 2nd/3rd star rifler alongside donk, and potentially even an AWP upgrade in m0NESY.\"\n\nSpirit is suffering from being in a great, yet at the same time awkward winning position. People are aching to see what Spirit could do with donk having real firepower alongside him, to have donk's efforts rewarded with star players realizing Spirit's potential even further. One thing's for sure - it will be interesting to see how things pan out in the following months regarding Spirit.",

That's one of the main reasons why it's so awkward. For one, there's no doubt in my mind that Kyosuke would be in talks of entering the roster and replacing either zont1x/magixx soon if the role clashes didn't exist. It still might happen, but it's not as clear cut, while also coming with potential risks.\n\n> Like you said, this is a suffering from success moment.

What Spirit needs isn't donk lite or aggro sh1ro, but instead better role players to replace inconsistencies.\n\nMy thoughts align very closely. I think for me the summary of the main question Spirit should be asking is either \"How do we fix the inconsistent performances from the support players\" OR - the question, if answered, will raise Spirit to #1  - \"How do we get donk a true and consistent second star rifler alongside him (Think what MalbsMd was to NiKo last year) without ruining the team, even if we have to make changes structurally?\"\n\nThe easiest boiled down one sentence explanation of Spirit's main problem for me essentially translates to this:  \"Zont1x is a fantastic 3rd rifler player.\" \n\nThe problem for Spirit is that he's the 2nd. He is closer to a Jimmphat than he is to a MalbsMd, Spinx or even flameZ/ropz. Despite zont1x being a good piece, it's hard to remember a genuine non-quiet carry performance from him fitting of a 2nd star rifler, except for perhaps game 4 on Nuke during Blast Finals 2024 in London against NaVi. \n\nIf the team gets someone with consistent firepower, a genuine 2nd star rifler without severing their synergy in case of a magixx departure even if the team structure has to change, then that's when Spirit will transcend its current state.",

If you are the manager, would you take that risk?\n\nYes, precisely *because* donk is in his prime. \n\ndonk is so invaluable to Spirit that if he was replaced with any other 'regular' rifler/entry rifler, they'd be a borderline top 10 team at best, with perhaps the occasional getting out of groups run. Chances are they'd be worse than teams like Liquid/Astralis even with Sh1ro, since he's such a complimentary piece to donk's aggression and in a way - he almost *needs* a player like donk to work, just like he needed Ax1Le to be that guy in Gambit.\n\nTo leer on the risk-averse side with that in mind would be a mistake. It could be viewed as greedy to try and win more than they currently are. It could also be prudent to objectively observe they could win more and find ways to implement that, especially when it's a very achievable situation for them.\n\nFor as much as any move is a risk, it could as easily be one of those 'why didn't we/they do this sooner', where the results show for themselves in less than six months (like it did with ropz's edition with Vitality, for example), with the previous concerns being long forgotten in the fans and pundits minds.\n\nHalf if not more of the Spirit's supporting cast fails to deliver in matches with even Sh1ro having low impact or disappearances at times and they still win those matches due to donk's existence. How bad can the risk really be? Is the new supposed better on paper replacement really going to post both the same numbers as the current cast while also disrupting the team to the point where they fall out of winning in the top 3-5? Chances are unlikely.",

What results are you envisioning for them in that scenario? \n\nKyosuke would have to be the biggest flop of upcoming talent possibly ever if spirit, after his addition, becomes like only the 10th best team in the world with Kyosuke clearly being the problem and not putting up numbers and maybe donk's output not being there as well due to their system being in disarray.\n\nIf Spirit didn't have essentially the second coming of donk in the waiting room and we'd be talking about changing out one of their players for someone like Perfecto or some other CIS firepower rifler, then I'd be inclined to agree, to stay on the risk-averse side and keep things as they are. However, we're not talking about some random upcoming rookie - we're talking about, as the HLTV users would say, 'Kyosuke'. If you don't take your chances with that kid, I don't who you will.\n\nEven if they drop to something like a top 5 team, then at least you're in the process of a restructure/change of team's identity and go from there.\n\nI mean, I get it. For most teams, disrupting a top 2 team for potential upgrades is crazy, but for Spirit - it genuinely feels like an inevitable way forward unless zont1x / magixx develop their consistency.

To increase their odds of doing so, they need the best players they can get. Players are judged on their performance over an extended period of time, not 1 offs (both in the positive and the negative sense). \n\nPlayers who are overperforming once and then dropping off significantly for the majority of the other tournaments, do not create a team that can consistently contend for major accolades. They will be considered outsiders/dark horses because they aren't seen as sufficiently skilled to win, unless random variables fall in their favour (such as a magixx popoff on top of the consistent factors also beign there (donk+shiro)).\n\nIn a situation where there is somewhat of a level playing field, this isn't a major issue yet. Until the end of 2024, there wasn't a single S-tier team that didn't have clear flaws. With the vitality +ropz move, they seem to have everything nailed and there aren't any clear flaws in their team left. This now means that there effectively isn't a level playing field anymore. There is Vitality and then there is the rest.",

The big 4 for all of them each year are Cologne, Kato & the Majors. That's when they all aim to peak. Especially the prestige of Cologne is something continuously spoken about.

It's the one big trophy they're still missing, and it's also the site of their biggest embarrassment yet. And for donk and zont1x it's a chance to complete the triple in their first 18 months on the tier-1 scene.",

Jame on virtus pro, biguzera on pain, electronic now on virtus pro all play high impact positions. So you see them not in the bottom of leaderboard like karrigan\n\nto further add context, faze's win condition has always been to set up their passive star players for success. So karrigan takes up the decoy role in T, and least traffic spots in CT to give others room. There's a argument to be made he can frag out if he plays better positions",
