If you think about it, every bombsite in the game is awkward to enter for Ts because you have to clear multiple angles, have a tight corridor, long stretch of map you have to run through and be in the open if they peek into you, or have to climb over something, even if you do your utility correctly. On anubis though, once you smoke cross and dark/ninja, and take connector or molly it, you just have to swing pillar. Ts have a crossfire from connector/main. They can straight up ferrari peek people corner/pillar and they can't hide. At most they can hide in a smoke and repeek, but they'll be in an obvious disadvantage. Unless the CT doesn't get a double kill, they'll be instantly traded.",
