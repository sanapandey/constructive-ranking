Crazy how far away from the pack Apex and Twistzz are despite their differing results.\n\nEdit: and stats allow for very little nuance, not every team is structured for their IGL to have great numbers just a fun comparison",

Sure he plays better roles than Karrigan and Snax, and he has a better rating than them, but he still puts up bot numbers.",
