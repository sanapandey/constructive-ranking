He's definitely the people's champion but every single metric supports Zywoo as the GOAT in the long run. S1mple only winning one major, less MVPs, lower career rating etc etc etc. Zywoo could easily be HLTV #1 this season and has already won 2 big events. He's not even close to slowing down. I have never loved watching anyone more than prime S1mple but he left the moment things got tough and left so abruptly just after his best season ever. Sucks as a CS esports fan to lose the most hype player ever. The feeling of the game doesn't seem to bother the other old guard players who are constantly top 20 like Niko, device, Elige, xantares, ropz, shiro etc. I think he just got burnt out and gave up.",

But again s1mple was extremely toxic towards them and they were unable to play like they just did.  \nAnd then as soon as s1mple benched himself people line IM and JL started to perform.  \nAll of this has nothing to do with war, family and other bs.

Its more about how they did it with different changes, rewarding deathballing, making the game snowball exremely hard, making splitpushing basically impossible against good players, mid cant be taken when behind unless you killed like 4+ while in the middle of the map... etc\n\nalso making harrassing characters not having to focus on last hitting and just pushing you back all the time because they just spam their stuff on you makes weak lanes even harder to play - you cant even really deny when they harrass you back to your guardian, and you can forget getting ganks, becuase nobody does that anymore since it punishes you too hard if you arent successful.",

For a game to go nuts it *needs* a \"it\" factor outside of the actual gameplay. Dota's it factor was the fact that it was one of the first high quality, non pay2win F2P game, at a time when league was exploding (for similar reasons) so tons of players flocked to it. CS's it factor was the skin economy. A lot of people seem to think that good gameplay and support is all a game needs (although these can help but only when paired with extremely effective marketing (this is the reason for valo's success) but we already know that Valve sucks at marketing), but if you look at history then you'll see games like CSGO and League were massive success *despite* being so janky and unwelcoming for most of their time. \n\nDeadlock is coming into a market saturated with F2P live service titles without any it factor. Mark my words it's going to have a similar fate to 'The Finals' after an initial hype period, it'll die down only to be played by a hardcore minority *unless* Valve can come up clutch with an it factor for it like they did for CS.",

And B) is ofc the skill expression based games. Outside of valve, riot also uses this design philosophy. But unlike valve who's games usually are tilted heavily towards either mechanical (CS) or mental (dota) skill expression, they try to balance the skill expression more and usually also rework any archaic or unintuitive (though still skill based) mechanics.",

Even more important than that is the fact that Riot are genuine masters at marketing stuff is why valorant succeeded.

How could you possibly imagine The Finals as being anything like a BR? It wasn't even advertised as one. This statement of yours really hurts your credibility.\n\n>Dreadlock is hitting the middle ground between a MOBA and FPS\u2026\n\nExcept it's not. \"Hitting the middle ground\" is what Valorant did between hero shooter and CS. Deadlock on the other hand wants to be a complex moba *and* a complex third person shooter. It's spreading itself too thin. Outside of the hardcore crowd (and I'm sure the hardcore crowd will *love* deadlock) people will simply get turned off by multiplied complexity of both a TPS and a MOBA. And the problem is that the hardcore crowd cannot sustain games.\n\n>Valve doesn\u2019t fuck up competitive games\n\nThe irony of saying this in the counter strike subreddit \n\n>and there is a group that will absolutely play it solely because valve made it on full release.\n\nThat's true.\n\n>The game is polished as hell.....it\u2019s going to get players.\n\nI already told you gameplay is not the deciding factor. And just to be clear, I'm *not* saying deadlock will die, but it simply won't reach val/CS/league/dota popularity.\n\n>There is a massive chunk of players who play mobas and would never touch a round-based shooter.\n\nSorry but you're treating live service games as genre based again. There are no \"MOBA players\" there are \"league players\" and there are \"dota players\" and neither of those groups is itching to play a TPS moba.",
