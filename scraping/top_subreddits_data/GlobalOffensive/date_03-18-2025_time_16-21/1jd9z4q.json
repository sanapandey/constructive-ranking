    "selftext": "Welcome to **Matchmaking Monday**! This is the weekly megathread where you can share your experiences, complaints, and feedback related to:\n\n* Ranked & Unranked Matchmaking\n* VAC, Hacking, and Cheating\n* Prime, Trust Factor, and Trusted Mode\n* Ranking\n* Queuing and Lobbies\n\nFeel free to discuss your matchmaking experience, rant or vent, discuss ideas & share feedback for improvement, and talk about your recent games.\n\n# What you should know\n\nKeep in mind that there is a limited amount of information available about these systems and how they work to keep them effective. If you have questions, here are some resources to review:\n\n**Trust Factor**\n\n* [Trust Factor Matchmaking FAQ (Steam Support Article)](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=5966-WKLC-4172)\n* [The Trust Factor: CS:GO Blog Post](https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/the-trust-factor/)\n* [Everything About Trust Factor](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/m3vk43/everything_about_trust_factor_that_i_could_find/) by u/awsmninja\n* [GDC Presentation by John McDonald (Valve)](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1024994/Robocalypse-Now-Using-Deep-Learning)\n* [Do you Trust the Trust Factor?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpKgLAE1OdY) by u/3kliksphilip\n\n**Ranks**\n\n* [Competitive Skill Groups and Profile Rank](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=5629-WUDL-8495)\n\n**Bans**\n\n* [Myth: Why doesn't Valve ban cheaters?](https://steamcommunity.com/app/730/discussions/0/1621726179584501164/)\n* [Competitive Cooldowns and Bans](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=1203-WJCV-7019)\n* [I've been Overwatch banned](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=5393-TLZX-2230)\n\n# What you can do\n\n**Give Feedback:**\n\n* Posting feedback or complaints on the subreddit is **not** the best way to get the attention of the developers. If you have any specific feedback to give, you can email the CS2 Development team here: [cs2team@valvesoftware.com](mailto:cs2team@valvesoftware.com)\n* They do read every email received, but are not able to reply to each one.\n* If you're experiencing low-quality matches, it is always worth emailing them. They use these reports to help improve the system.\n\n**Report Cheaters:**\n\n* Report cheaters using the in-game report system by right-clicking their name on the scoreboard, and clicking \"report\". If the game is over, report their Steam Community profile.\n* If you notice certain trends or have other feedback, you can email the developers using the email address above.\n* To report a specific cheat, follow [these steps](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-Radz-6869#report) to notify the VAC development team.\n\n# The guidelines\n\nWhile we encourage discussion about these topics, as a reminder, the following are *not* allowed. Note this isn't an exhaustive list, and you should review the [r/GlobalOffensive Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/about/rules/) before commenting.\n\n* Accusations towards any player related to cheating\n* Posting profiles of alleged cheaters (if posting pictures of matches, redact any usernames)\n* Posting any cheating gameplay footage\n* Reporting cheats, linking to cheats/websites, or discussing cheats in technical detail\n\nThis weekly discussion thread does not change any of our existing submission rules - you're still allowed to discuss these topics elsewhere on the subreddit as usual, but we do remove a large number of them as they quickly become repetitive and the majority have little meaningful discussion. If you decide to make a separate post instead of utilizing this thread, we encourage you to focus on starting meaningful discussion or providing constructive criticism.",

            "body": "I\u2019ve recently gotten back into Faceit matchmaking with my premade, having taken about a 1 year hiatus from Faceit and only playing Premier/comp on official servers during that period. After ~20 matches in Faceit over the last 3 weeks, I have truly been left baffled at the state of Premier, and whether there is any value whatsoever in playing on \u201cofficial\u201d servers. Games on Faceit, in every single match we\u2019ve played since returning, simply feel \u201cnormal\u201d. Players on the enemy team will make good plays, but also make mistakes that can be capitalized on. You don\u2019t get prefired on off angles the first time holding it after 7 rounds of playing the site differently. Matches that are 10-4 don\u2019t suddenly feel unwinnable as the enemy duo with private profiles or 600 hours rack up multi kill after multi kill to win 12-10. You can actually get a feel for how the enemy plays, and tune your decision making to account for how you think they will position and peek.\n\n\nIn part, I think that some of this can be attributed to simple matchmaking, in the sense that games feel better matched (both intra and inter team matchmaking). However, this hiatus from Premier and foray into Faceit has left me with the impression that the \u201csuspicious\u201d behavior (not necessarily confirmed cheating) that we experience in at least 50% of Premier games just doesn\u2019t exist when there is a legitimate anticheat software that serves more purpose than a wet paper towel. When we were consistently playing Premier, I would have estimated that ~10% of our games had identifiable cheaters (I.e., watch the demo to see them never clear an angle that doesn\u2019t have one of our heads on their crosshair), but now I feel that the real percentage of compromised games in Premier is much, much higher, simply from the fact that those \u201csuspicious\u201d games and moments do not happen on Faceit. Full stop. \n\nSo, at least for now, Premier is dead to my premade. Am I taking copium pills, and players in my Premier elo just happen to have perfect game sense and aim more frequently than on Faceit? Perhaps. I don\u2019t know the extent to which Premier is compromised by cheaters, but the consistent difference in game quality between the two platforms is large enough to make me suspect that Premier is not worth caring about in the slightest.",

Does the matchmaking work at all?",
