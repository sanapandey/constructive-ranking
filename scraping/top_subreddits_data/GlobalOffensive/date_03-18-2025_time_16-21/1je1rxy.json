Typically I would say Manchester United since the early 2010s but even they didn't implode as much.\n\nMaybe how Deportivo La Coruna went from the Super Depor years to playing in the second and third division (football's version of tier2 or tier2.5 where things are still professional but significantly less lucrative) of the Spanish football pyramid.\n\nGood luck to Staehr though.",

Comparable to Astralis who used to win every major and now are going on I think is it four years without even making a major appearance?",

Nobody really fears the team(s) anymore, but there is potential there regardless. It's generally suggested that one day they will bounce back, the only question is the when.\n\nIn hindsight, my Depor suggestion was probably too harsh. The CS version of that would be more like \"the entire roster consists of completely unproven nonames who most recently got cooked in the quarter finals of a $3k prize pool tournament in rural Northeast Hungary, their first LAN in many years\".",

Staehr is a great player but he isn't showing he is a wordclass player that belongs on a far higher level than the #10-15 range.\n\nWhere would you have him go first of all? He exactly has 7 options that can be considered 'better' destinations: Vitality, Mouz, NAVI, G2, Faze, Liquid, Falcons. From those 7, the majority are likely not interested in him at all. The ones who could perhaps be interested are barely an upgrade over Astralis, which leads me to zoom in on the Jail comment. You imply that he's in a horrible position that he cannot get out of with this contract even though there is no clear option where he could/should go instead and the extension is presumably about only 2 years.\n\nAgain, excited to hear your what you were thinking with this comment because I'm not seeing it in the slightest.",
