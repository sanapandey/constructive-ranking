            "body": "Saint-Domingue was renamed Haiti in the Declaration of Independence issued January 1, 1804. It is not explained why the word \"Haiti\" (actually Hayti, in the original document) was used. This is the closest the declaration comes to an explanation:\n\n> Let us walk in other footsteps, let us imitate those nations who, carrying their solicitude all the way to the future and not willing to leave an example of cowardice for posterity, have preferred to be exterminated rather than to lose their place as on the list of free nations.\n\nSo, there was a conscious desire to honor the exterminated Ta\u00ednos. But if the Ta\u00ednos had been thoroughly erased, how would the slaves have known about their decision \"to be exterminated\" rather than enslaved, and how did their name for the island survive?\n\nIn 1494, Columbus' physician sent a letter to Seville explaining that \"Haiti\" was the local word for the eastern half of Santo Domingo, which is now known as the Dominican Republic. Another member of Columbus' expedition claimed that the natives called the whole island \"Ahit\u00ed\". It possible that the place-name may have originally referred to the area now known as Los Haitises National Park. In any case, this information was confirmed and added to publications by Peter Martyr d'Anghiera and others, so it was published in many French-language books by the 18th century.\n\nDavid Geggus writes that \"by the time the French began large-scale importations of black slaves in the late seventeenth century, the native Arawaks had been almost extinct for about one hundred years.\" There are many fanciful stories of slave communication with a few surviving Ta\u00edno or even Ta\u00edno influence on voodoo practice, but there does not seem to be any evidence for this. However, it is well-documented that Native Americans from other locations around the Gulf of Mexico, including Louisiana and South America, were captured as slaves and brought to the Caribbean. From this, there appears to have emerged a strong feeling of solidarity between Black and Indian slaves. (Other cultural exchanges also emerged. It has been suggested that Tituba, whose folk religious practices sparked the Salem Witch Trials, was a South American Indian brought to Massachusetts via Barbados.) \n\nIn 1788, an anonymous pamphlet was published at Les Cayes, a small but prosperous fishing port far from the colonial bureaucracy of Port-au-Prince. The author called for Saint-Dominigue to declare independence as a separate state called \"A\u00efti\". After this, the word \"Haiti\" appears more and more in private letters, even before the revolution. Haiti\u2019s first historian, Thomas Madiou, wrote simply that the Ta\u00edno name was \"on everyone's lips\" in the late 18th century. For this reason, it appears that the decision to rename the island was a collective one rather than an individual proclamation, brought about by an intellectual feeling of solidarity with the island's genocided original inhabitants rather than any communication with survivors.\n\n**References**\n\nGeggus, David. \"The naming of Haiti.\" *New West Indian Guide/Nieuwe West-Indische Gids* 71.1-2 (1997): 43-68.\n\nGeggus, David. \u201cHaiti\u2019s Declaration of Independence.\u201d In *The Haitian Declaration of Independence: Creation, Context, and Legacy*, edited by Julia Gaffield, 25\u201341.
