    "selftext": "This question is inspired by Morrissey from the Smiths quoting dozens of older movies in his songs, as well as choosing stills from movies for their single and album covers. \n\nI've read that Scorsese practically lived at the cinema in his youth, and that he rented film reels and projected them at home, but I feel like 70s Manchester is not exactly New York City when it comes to demand for repertory cinemas. Am I wrong? Were there lots of small theatres dotted about where I could see Rebel Without a Cause, the Warhol Factory movies or 60s Alain Delon pictures? Is a home projector a reasonable thing for a working class teenager to have? If I went to a local college, would there be access to something rarer through their library or art classes? Or was my best hope scouring the TV guide and hoping that one of the three channels would show something worthwhile, and that no one in my family wanted to watch something else at the same time? If I caught a movie on TV once and loved it, how long on average would I have to wait until it was rerun?",
