    "selftext": "I found a fresco from 1630 in a Czech church and it depicts a clearly smiling Jesus and (presumably) Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene. Is this rare in Europe? Are there any other depictions of a smiling crucified Jesus? The church guide told me it was one of a kind but I honestly couldn't tell if he was being serious or just joking. Now I'm very curious about this. I don't know if this is the right place to ask about iconography, but it was the first thing I thought of.",
