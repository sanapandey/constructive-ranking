    "selftext": "Engagement diamonds, embalming of loved ones, and multiblade razor cartridges are things that people buy as a matter of course, at least in US, with roots that seem to be in marketing schemes (but correct me if I'm wrong). I've read that emblaming wasn't regularly practiced in the US until salesmen started pushing it beginning during the Civil War, to the point that some in the US think it's mandatory. There's the famous story of De Beers inventing the idea of the diamond ring for engagements to sell more diamonds. And, most recently, razor companies convinced America that multiblade cartridge razors are how you shave, largely replacing the (I believe) higher quality, more effective, and ultimately cheaper safety razor.\n\n* Firstly, are my impressions above correct? \n* Are there other aspects of American culture or other cultures around the world that have similar roots in marketing efforts? \n* Were there aspects of historical cultures that had similar roots?",
