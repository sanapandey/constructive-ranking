    "selftext": "I'm a household manager to \"Ultra High Net Worth\" families in the US and have long held an interest in fictional media about class intersection \u2013 Downton Abbey, The Gilded Age, The Nanny Diaries, classic works like Emma, etc.\n\nMaybe this is regional, but I've never worked for nor even met the kind of wealthy family who is aloof and detached from their kids, letting the nannies take over and do everything. More and more, I'm seeing parents putting a very high priority on spending as much time as possible with their kids. Obviously all billionaires have family offices, but in my most recent round of interviewing for a new position I was surprised to find that even a lot of upper middle class families are looking for full time household support so they can spend more quality time with the kids.\n\nThe trope from most popular media is that the richer you are, the less interest you take in your children personally and the more you see them as an extension of your own legacy or an investment in your own future. Also in media, poor people are depicted as neglecting their kids and constantly losing track of them. Possibly the most hands on parents from movies and tv are the 90s upper middle class suburban milieu, but I have no way of knowing how wide spread the Family Stone, Beethoven, Father of the Bride kind of families really were. In my own life, I've found white working impoverished families to be extremely neglectful of their children, while families of color seem to hold their kids more dear across all classes.\n\nWere these tropes rooted in reality in the modern US/UK? How have things changed in the last 10, 20, 50 years in child rearing and family attitudes across classes? I think I have a good understanding of pre-industrialization attitudes towards kids and family life, so really what I mean is like post-war on. Do we have any way of knowing how hands on, affectionate and present people of different classes have been with their children over time?",
