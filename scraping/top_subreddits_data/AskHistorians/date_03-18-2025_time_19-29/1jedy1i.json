    "selftext": "I had an art history exam recently and one of the questions was this:\n\nWho put an end to the Reign of Terror?  \n\\-Napoleon Bonaparte\n\n\\-Charles X\n\n\\-The Jacobins\n\n\\-Louis XVI\n\nI answered 'The Jacobins', however my professor marked this as wrong.  I emailed her about this and another question which I'll get to later, and she reaffirmed saying this: \"...and Napoleon's leadership put an end to the Reign of Terror initiated by the Jacobins.\" -Prof.\n\nThe other disputed question was this:  \n\n\nNicholas Poussin won the Prix de Rome: True or False\n\nTo which I responded false, and got it wrong.  When I disputed, she responded: \"Yes, Poussin won the Prix de Rome, which is why Louis XIV declared him an excellent painter\" -Prof.\n\nI am not just posting this because I wish I got a better grade or something, I've just been scouring the internet looking for a source for both questions.  I cannot find anywhere that Napoleon had anything to do with ending the Reign of Terror or that Nicholas Poussin won the Prix de Rome.  Hoping for some sources, if I'm wrong it's fine, I just would love to know what the truth is.  Thank you",

            "body": ">\"Yes, Poussin won the Prix de Rome, which is why Louis XIV declared him an excellent painter\"\n\nNot possible. The Grand Prix (aka \"Prix de Rome\") was only open to students of the Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture, and students were only awarded a residency in Rome from 1664 onwards (the first year, 1663, only bursaries were awarded). Nicholas Poussin died in 1665, aged 71... He wasn't a student of the Acad\u00e9mie, in fact when the Acad\u00e9mie was founded he was already 55 years old. Poussin was \"Premier Peintre du Roi\" under Louis XIII, from 1641 onwards, and by the time Louis XIV came to power he was already back in Rome where he stayed until his death.\n\nIs your teacher confusing him with \u00c9tienne de La Vall\u00e9e Poussin, who is a descendant of Nicholas Poussin and who did win the Prix de Rome much later, in 1759?\n\nEDIT: I should add that we do know who won the price in the years that Poussin was still alive:\n\n* 1663 \u2013 Jean-Baptiste Corneille (1er prix), Jacques Antoine Friquet de Vauroze (2\u00e8me prix)\n* 1664 \u2013 Pierre Monier (1er prix), Jean-Baptiste Corneille (2\u00e8me prix)\n* 1665 \u2013 Fran\u00e7ois Bonnemer (1er prix), Nicolas Rabon (2\u00e8me prix)",

Danton was very popular, because of his rhetorical qualities first, because he helped Revolutionary France win the war and push Austrians, Prussians, Spanish and English out of the territory second. His trial is a bit of a last drop for elected official in La Convention to put an end to La Terreur.\n\nThe period that followed La Terreur, Le Directoire is famous for its deep corruption, raising of inequalities, and to be overall a bourgeoisie pushback after La Terreur. Napoleon with his coup put an end to Le Directoire, not La Terreur.\n\n[R\u00e9volution, Consulat, Empire](https://www.amazon.fr/R%C3%A9volution-Consulat-Empire-1789-1815-compact/dp/2701191963/258-9751269-3409707?pd_rd_w=883EL&content-id=amzn1.sym.11a9cd48-28fe-49f3-acef-0cb031593c06&pf_rd_p=11a9cd48-28fe-49f3-acef-0cb031593c06&pf_rd_r=HDTMZRYTWTH82MF4JSED&pd_rd_wg=T5sat&pd_rd_r=9d90e85d-7926-4e0c-baf5-58f74a150a30&pd_rd_i=2701191963&psc=1) (that I have opened on my knees while typing lol) and overall the whole collection directed by Joel Cornette are wonderful and easy to read for neophytes. I know some of the Bellin Histoire are translated, maybe this collection is too.",
