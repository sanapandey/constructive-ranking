However, this is simply a hypothesis; the urbanization of Africa in general introduced many new factors, including [a noticeable increase in sexually transmitted diseases](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0009936).\n\n[G.E. Parris](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2007.02.033) further proposes that HIV was brought from southeastern Cameroon to Kinshasa by a five-year-old girl, St\u00e9phanie Ntongo, who participated in a clinical trial of pamaquine (for treatment of sleeping sickness) at the Laboratoire M\u00e9dical de L\u00e9opoldville in 1927. It therefore specifically stuck to needles being reused in this Belgian laboratory. Since it is spread easily by flies and frequently leads to death, sleeping sickness was a deep concern for colonial administrators. During this period when HIV may have been spreading under the radar, infected needles were frequently reused in a mad rush by French and Belgian colonial doctors to inoculate the general population against sleeping sickness, causing some of those treated to [die in agony](https://www.amazon.com/Lomidine-Files-Medical-Disaster-Colonial/dp/1421423235) from gangrene.\n\nAgain, this is only a hypothesis, since the virus was not noticed until decades later.",

However, there is something puzzling about this: the earliest phylogenetic groupings are group N, which spreads slowly and has always been limited to southeastern Cameroon, and group M, which evolved rapidly in Kinshasa (far from Cameroon) but then exhibits limited change for the next 20 years. There are no outbreaks in between southeastern Cameroon and Kinshasa, which is what we would expect if N became more virulent through zoonotic agents, or if N was spread by simple use of needles. Parris proposes N evolved into M by being rapidly selected for resistance to anti-malarial drugs like pamaquine, which would have happened unwittingly in a laboratory setting. He further suggests that a single carrier of N came from Cameroon to Kinshasa, which he identifies as Ntongo based on her surname.",
