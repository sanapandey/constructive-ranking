    "selftext": "I was looking at the interesting [recent answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ig9l73/comment/maqm780/?context=3) by /u/GalahadDrei about how Athens went from being a small community to major city in the modern age, which mentions that it was King Otto, first King of the independent Greece who insisted on Athens as his capital. This lead me to wonder where the newly-independent Greece got a king from and I learned from quick internet searching that both the monarchy itself and the initial (and soon deposed, though replaced by a similar import) King Otto was selected by a conference of the Great Powers--Britain, France, and Russia after those powers assisted with Greece's war of independence from the Ottoman Empire. Wikipedia says the insistence on a monarchy came from Britain specifically.\n\nWhy did Britain require Greece to have a monarchy? \n\nIdeological commitment to monarchism as such, even separate from any specific royal tradition? French Revolution/Napoleonic war hangover? Aesthtics?",

            "body": "All of those! An important context is that Alexander Ypsilantis crossed the river Prut and symbolically began the Greek Revolution (even if the actual uprising was a bit of a false start) in 1821, only six years after Waterloo. And while we today might see Napoleon as having a rather ambiguous relationship to revolution and republicanism to say the least, at the time he was a great hero to liberals (or proto-liberals) across Europe. Mark Mazowzer's book *The Greek Revolution*, which I am entirely drawing from here and recommend heartily, opens with a quote from Theodore Kolokotronis, the charismatic bandit leader of the Greek revolutionary army, that I think illustrates the attitude:\n\n>In my opinion, the French revolution and Napoleon opened the eyes of the world. Before that the nations did not recognise themselves, and people thought kings were gods on earth and said whatever they did was good. For that reason, it is harder to rule a people today.\n\nAnd as much as Napoleon was an inspiration to liberals, he was also a bogeyman to the conservative (if I can call them that) forces that had triumphed at Waterloo and forged the Concert of Europe. While the Revolution was defeated, it continued to haunt politics, including in the form of secret societies that sprung up (or more often were imaged to spring up) across Europe and were the target of quite intense repression. A couple years back I asked a question here about this [and recieved a great answer](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/tb0bex/what_led_to_the_rise_of_secret_societies_in/) from /u/dhmontgomery that I think does a good job of portraying the general political climate of the post-Revolutionary years.\n\nInto this climate steps the Greek Revolution, which was begun (sort of) by one of these revolutionary secret societies, the Filiki Eteria, and furthermore represented a major destabilization of the international order. It is sometimes represented as an East vs West conflict and also its end is sometimes characterized as a joint European Philhellenic intervention to liberate Greece--this is how I heard it first--but that is not really true. European political leaders treated the Revolution with extreme distrust and support of the Revolution was heavily politicized and became a great cause celebre among liberals in particular.^1 To give an illustrative example, Lord Byron, the greatest Philhellene of all, wrote several poems about Napoleon that may be critical of him but from a place of disappointment (To give another, the Duke of Wellington opposed Greek independence). This of course reinforced the fear of the Greek Revolution \"spreading\".\n\nSo after Greek independence was unintentionally secured by the allied navy (the Battle of Navarino was something a comedy of errors) the primary concern of the great powers was to make sure the matter became settled, and part of that was ensuring that Greece dud not become a republic. An important point that Mazower makes is that this should not really be seen as an imposition, there was no real resistance to a foreign king from Greeks (at first) and the Revolution was primarily not concerned with the \"constitutional question\". That came later.\n\nAs I said up top, my source here is almost entirely from Mark Mazower's *The Greek Revolution*.\n\n\n^1 I remember reading Mazower's book in early 2022 at the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the parallels were striking.",

After the Bourbon restoration - all the major powers of Europe were bonded together in the Quintuple Alliance. They were all united by the idea of protecting the social status quo especially Monarchy.\n\nThe alliance formally ended with the death of Tsar Alexander but they still cooperated to support Greek independence, so the outcome was largely in line with the values of this cooperation - which is to preserve the institution of Monarchy and combat Republicanism.",
