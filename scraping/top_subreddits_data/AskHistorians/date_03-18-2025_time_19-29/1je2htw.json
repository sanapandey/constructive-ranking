            "body": "Part 1: \"Seem\" is an important word here, because managing popular impressions during the Cold War could be as valuable as the underlying facts. Technology became one of several fronts of (sometimes) peaceful competition between the U.S. and USSR. But broadly, the Soviets never really had an across-the-board technological advantage, so much as edges in specific areas that they trumpeted loudly. Over time, the inefficiencies and obstacles of central planning became increasingly apparent, while what early advantages the Soviets DID have petered out.\n\nDuring WWII and the early postwar era, the Soviets and the Western Allies competed to snap up as many German scientists and exiles as they could. Germany had been a world leader in academics and research, partly owing to a notably strong university system, but Nazism had driven out or murdered a considerable number of Jewish intellectuals. The Manhattan Project, for instance, was chock-full of brilliant refugees happy to help their new home win the war. The Soviets were likewise able to poach thousands of German scientists. Those who'd worked on the V-2 rockets became the foundation of the Soviet space program, though in fairness it was native son Sergei Korolev who actually made the whole effort work.\n\nRocketry was a particularly good candidate for the USSR to highlight. It played to Soviet strengths in terms of scientists and heavy industry. It was the type of project that would never be even remotely profitable in a free market, yet which a big top-down plan could bang out relatively quickly with dedicated effort and funding. Moreover, it quickly became clear that powerful rockets were the peak of prestige, the proof if leadership in both peaceful technology (launching Sputnik) and defense technology (ICBMs.) Sputnik did indeed terrify the U.S. into thinking that Soviet STEM was way ahead and that Americans needed to catch up ASAP. I suspect this is the era you're thinking of, when the Soviet edge in the Space Race made it seem that the West was slipping behind.\n\nIt just wasn't really true. Soviet technology was never broadly more advanced than Western technology. Remember, this was a country that had been a mostly-rural backwater at the start of WWI and which had been absolute ravaged by WWII. Early Soviet five-year plans after WWII focused on heavy industry, defense, and grain production to the relative exclusion of consumer goods. This began to change by the 1960s in terms of planning, but these plans never succeeded in coming anywhere close to Western light industry. The degree to which the Soviet system DID build up heavy industry and armaments in the former Russian Empire was truly remarkable. It just didn't translate so well to things that went in a kitchen.\n\nTo this end, it became very useful for the Soviets to bluff aggressively and pad their official statistics. The West grew skeptical of GDP figures and sought other ways to measure growth indirectly. Khrushchev learned in 1956 in the Suez Crisis that if he loudly claimed he had a huge arsenal of missiles and was ready to use them, no one would openly fact-check the claim, and to the contrary they'd back down in the face of nuclear armageddon. Propaganda and public opinion were huge in an ideological conflict.\n\nYou could really get a hint of the Soviet problem by the late 50s. When Khrushchev and Nixon met in the \"Kitchen Debate,\" Khrushchev was simultaneously criticizing the household gadgetry he saw as wasteful symbols of capitalist excess, while also arguing that the U.S. simply had a tremendous headstart and the USSR would catch up and exceed it in no time. The next year, John F. Kennedy (running against Nixon, who'd been Eisenhower's VP) would allege that the U.S. had fallen behind the Soviets on defense, the alleged \"missile gap.\" Yet everyone in power on both sides knew that the U.S. was actually way ahead on ICBMs. Eisenhower simply couldn't reveal that information without compromising security. (Indeed, had the Soviets truly possessed an enormous arsenal of effective ICBMs by the early 60s, they wouldn't have needed to park shorter-range missiles in Cuba.)",

                    "body": "Part 2: But the point is that Soviet technology on the whole was starting from behind and lagging progressively more and more over time. The U.S. was succeeding through a combination of public and private efforts including a really robust university system, government R&D and funding, and free enterprise. The Soviets had hoped that central planning would rapidly launch them ahead, and were instead seeing it stagnate and regress. The free market had always been more efficient when it came to allocating resources towards consumer good production. Do you have any idea how many spatulas and salt-shakers the Soviet populace wanted in 1965? Neither did Soviet bureaucrats.\n\nComputing was a good example of a particularly hard limit on the system. Microprocessors are remarkably finicky to mass-produce, to the extent that even developed countries still struggle to make them to consistent high standards, and an early head-start in manufacturing may prove decisive. In this context, unlike rocketry, free markets had dramatic advantages over central planning. American computing saw a handful of universities focus on the relevant technology, significant government funding given the implications for defense, and smart graduates launching tiny start-ups in someone's garage.\n\nMeanwhile, serious changes in Soviet manufacturing required top-down planning from an increasingly inflexible and entrenched bureaucracy. You might think that the Ministry of the Electronics Industry might seem a natural fit for ramping up computer production, but serious change might also need involvement of the Ministry of the Communications Equipment Industry, Ministry of Electrical Engineering, Ministry of Light Industry, the State Committee for Science and Technology... and in the end it was the Ministry of Radio Technology that actually took point on personal computers. All of these were led by career bureaucrats who knew exactly what happened to Soviets who spoke too freely or were perceived as critical of the system. In the end, it proved simpler to try to reverse-engineer/clone Western computers.",

                                    "body": "My argument is that central planning was an early advantage in areas where you needed someone to abruptly invest like crazy in a single achievable project for reasons of national prestige. It did indeed support the Soviet space program in advancing rapidly early on, and materialized as a temporarily more advanced program. The U.S. was interested previously but had plenty of other priorities. This shocked the U.S. enough to overcome some of its natural obstacles and to start investing like crazy, to a degree that the Soviets would be unlikely to match.\n\nThe Soviets did have some capable universities, but this is also an area where they were trying to catch up like crazy. Pre-revolutionary Russia was something like 75-80% illiterate. By WWII, intense literacy campaigns had knocked that down to something like 10%, which is about where the US had been in 1900. By the 1950s the USSR approached full literacy. This was an incredible achievement, yet also reflected the depth of the education gap to be overcome.\n\nNow, think about how long it can take to develop a really serious university. Most of the Ivy League universities precede the American Revolution. Some of the most prestigious European universities are approaching their thousandth year. It often took either considerable government funds to start a public university, or generous donations to start a private one. The U.S. may be relatively young, but it still had dozens of colleges and universities by 1830, and by the turn of the 20th century any decent-sized town was likely to have at least one:\n\n[https://dsl.richmond.edu/historicalatlas/80/d/](https://dsl.richmond.edu/historicalatlas/80/d/)\n\nThe Russian Empire had a substantially larger population than the U.S. at the time, but even with serious investment was still measuring its enrollment in higher education in the tens of thousands, at a time when the U.S. was enrolling hundreds of thousands:\n\n[https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft9h4nb67r&chunk.id=d0e649&toc.id=d0e607&brand=ucpress](https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft9h4nb67r&chunk.id=d0e649&toc.id=d0e607&brand=ucpress)\n\n[https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d19/tables/dt19\\_301.20.asp](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d19/tables/dt19_301.20.asp)\n\nSo by the Cold War, the U.S. was able to build heavily on the investments of preceding centuries like the land-grant universities, plus benefitting from enormous waves of immigration. (The fact that old-money American universities were enacting discriminatory Jewish quotas should reinforce how many qualified applicants, most of them first- to third-generation immigrants, were showing up.) The Soviets were building on a small imperial system that had been intended to serve just a few percent of the population.\n\nEarly computing required very different technology from later computing. Vacuum tubes and transistors overlapped significantly with defense technology and weren't nearly as difficult to mass-produce as integrated circuits/microprocessors. Indeed, the orders to copy Western computers really weren't the best approach and represented a capitulation that would hamstring long-term progress. But a series of bureaucrats were pressured to make targets or face personal consequences, and this is what they came up with.\n\nConsider the question: Why did Silicon Valley blow up when and where it did? Well, a wealthy 19th-century robber baron donated a bushel of money to start a university by the bay while the government built more, the Department of Defense poured money into R&D knowing that computers had military applications in the Cold War, the Small Business Administration poured money into new businesses, and a robust system of private enterprise poured in even more money in the hopes of multiplying it. A bunch of people who'd been raised to believe that hard work, risk, and innovation might net them enormous fortunes took risks in the setting of high confidence that public and private institutions would reliably support them.",
