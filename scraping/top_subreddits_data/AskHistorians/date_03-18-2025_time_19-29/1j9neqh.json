For example, \"how did we go from steam engine to jet engines?\" and \"how do steam engines work? Jet engines?\"\n\nBut that's just one topic. He's been asking these questions about *everything* and my poor sister is just so tired. I figured I'll get him a book as an early birthday gift and he can tell everyone all about what he's learned.\n\n(Also, google sucks now? While trying to find a book on my own, I searched *middle grade book about development of technology* and got a ton books for younger children but also a reddit post asking about fantasy books for children. I mean, I've known this for a while.\n\nBut my nephew's getting to an age where we'd like to be able to unleash him on search engines unsupervised. My sister and I had a class in middle school to learn about how to find reliable internet sources (tree octopi, if anyone knows what I'm talking about). But apparently his school isn't going to cover it and my sister doesn't know where to start teaching it, especially now there are **books** written and illustrated by AI.)",

After him, over time  were quite a few variations- and, oddly enough, the action for the big grand piano is in some ways simpler than the action for the little console piano.\n\n There are books on the history of the piano that include the history of the piano action. One recent one would be Edwin Good's 1982 *Giraffes, Black Dragons, and Other Pianos: A Technological History from Cristofori to the Modern Grand*. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.  \n\nA search for \"history of the piano action\" will reveal a number of YouTube videos, etc. But for what it's worth, the Vienna Museum for Science and Technology (Technisches Museum Wien) has ( or at least had) a very large display of historical pianos. Beside each one was an \"playable\" example of the action for one of the keys, so you could feel how each one functioned, as well as see.",

                    "body": "For boarding axes, \"boarding\" means mostly that they're a specialised naval version. They were used by boarding parties, and also when defending against boarding attempts, but they were also important for damage control in battle. Boarding pike were primarily used for defending against boarding attempts (so \"anti-boarding pike\" might be a better name, and also for \"boarding nets\" for the same reason).\n\nBoarding pikes varied over time, and part of the difference between the majority of surviving boarding and \"land pikes\" is due to them being much more recent (most surviving boarding pikes are 19th century, while in armies on land the pike was being replaced by the bayonet in the late 17th to mid-18th centuries). There are two main ways in which boarding pikes have always differed from land pikes: they are shorter, and they always have non-snag heads (while land pikes only usually have non-snag heads). Both result from the environment in which they were used.\n\nLength is straightforward. Too long makes it difficult to use on a ship, since rigging will get in the way. Also, they weren't used to face opposing formation of pikes, or lance-armed cavalry. Great length wasn't needed to avoid a reach disadvantage against such enemies, because those enemies weren't there. 19th century boarding pikes are usually about 2.4m (the British models of that century were 2.3m). This comfortably out-reaches swords, and is short enough for the weapon to be handy and easily manoeuvrable (this is the length that George Silver described as \"the perfect length\" for such weapons in his *Paradoxes of Defense* of 1599). It's also long enough that a boarding party will find them difficult to bring with them for the attack, and long enough to have a large reach advantage over any short spears a boarding party might bring (thus, the lack of opposing boarding pikes in battle). Earlier pikes varied more in length than later pikes, from about 2.1m to 3.6m.\n\nBoarding pikes were often used together with boarding nets, large nets used to stop boarders from getting onto the ship. Snag-free heads were important to allow their use against boarders trying to get through or cut through a boarding net). Even if boarding nets were not in use, it was important for the pike not to snag on rigging. This meant that the back of the head should have nothing to catch on a boarding net or rigging, and the mounting on the head on the haft should have no projections that might catch on ropes. Earlier boarding pikes often had leaf-shaped heads (with rounded backs, to avoid snagging), and sockets and langets fitted flush with the haft. Later heads were usually spike-shaped rather than leaf-shaped - 3 or 4-sided heads similar to most cavalry lance heads of the time.\n\nA broad-bladed leaf-shaped pike, probably late 18th century and American, along with photos of leaf-shaped and spike-headed pikes from Gilkerson, *Boarder's Away*:\n\nhttps://www.militariahub.com/late-18th-century-american-or-british-naval-seamans-boarding-pike/\n\nA narrow leaf-shaped head:\n\nhttps://ussconstitutionmuseum.org/collection-items/1797-pattern-boarding-pike/\n\nSpike-headed pikes:\n\nhttps://collections.sea.museum/objects/32788/naval-boarding-pike\n\nhttps://www.futuremuseum.co.uk/collections/features/online-exhibitions/dean-castle-arms-and-armour/pole-arms-and-melee-weapons/naval-boarding-pike\n\nSome earlier pikes had leaf-shaped heads similar to land pike heads such as this:\n\nhttps://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/26084\n\nand some (quite possibly many) early boarding pikes were simply cut-down land pikes.\n\nA third difference is in the types of butts. This isn't a universal difference, since some boarding pikes used the same style of butt fittings as land pikes, leading to complaints and changes. Where a land pike had a butt fitting, it was usually a metal conical or spike-shaped shaped butt, which could be used to stand the pike upright in the ground (better than either lying it flat on the ground where the bottom side would get wet, and it could be a tripping hazard in camp, or leaning it against something angled, which could cause the haft to bend). The ability to be stood upright in the ground was useless aboard a ship, and such butts produced complaints about the point damaging deck timbers. They were also a potential hazard to fellow sailors during battle. The two solutions: (a) don't use metal butt fittings (see the first example linked above), or (b) use metal butt fittings that allow the wood haft to project through them, stopping the metal butt from resting on the deck. For (b), see the butts at:\n\nhttp://www.thepirateslair.com/9-boarding-pike-british-1.html\n\nAs for boarding axes, they were primarily tools that could also be used as weapons. They differed from wood-cutting axes by being relatively thin-bladed (and therefore lighter), and by having a stout spike. They also commonly had langets reinforced the haft near the head, and providing a more secure attachment of the head. They differed from battle axes in that the back spike was blunt, and often stouter than usual for battle axes (battle axes were often also thin-bladed, to keep the weight down).\n\nBoth the blade and the spike were used for damage control. The blade was used to cut fallen rigging as needed to allow debris to be thrown overboard. The spike was used to drag rigging and debris, including burning rigging, sails, and wood. The spike could also be used to lever out hot shot from the timbers. In battle, they were used as battle axes, but cutting lines and boarding nets were important tasks - boarders used them to cut through boarding nets, and defenders used them to cuts lines from ships attempting to board. They were also used for breaching doors when boarding, although they were lighter than ideal for this task (fire axes/firemen's axes, with breaching doors and walls as key tasks, are much heavier, about 2.5-3.8kg vs the 700-900g of boarding axes). Curved cutting edges were useful, allowing easier cutting of ropes on the deck while standing - strongly curved blades were usual for French axes, while US and British models were often straighter-bladed.\n\nGently-curved US and British axes:\n\nhttps://www.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/rmgc-object-533183\n\nhttps://royalarmouries.org/collection/object/object-23269\n\nhttps://royalarmouries.org/collection/object/object-14709\n\nhttps://collections.musee-mccord-stewart.ca/en/objects/98828/\n\nhttps://www.eriemaritimemuseum.org/blog/boarding-axes\n\nMore curved blades:\n\nhttps://royalarmouries.org/collection/object/object-14696\n\nhttps://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/object/Boarding-axe--d16a1a82ab6d727583078362a850c885/catalogue-entry\n\nhttps://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/weapons/index.php/tour-by-region/oceania/europe/arms-and-armour-europe-154/index.html\n\nSince cutting things on deck was important, hafts were usually long enough to allow this to be done without too much trouble. This length also allowed the axes to be used two-handed if need be. Many surviving examples have been shortened. Original hafts usually have a bulbous butt, and shorter examples usually lack this, showing that their original hafts were shortened.\n\nReferences:\n\nAn excellent on-line resource for boarding axes: https://www.boardingaxe.com/index.html\n\nWilliam Gilkerson, *Boarders Away*, Andrew Mowbray, 1991 is a superb references for hand-to-hand weapons in the Age of Sail: https://archive.org/details/boardersaway0000gilk - *Boarders Away Volume II* covers firearms.\n\nFor George Silver on weapons lengths, see https://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/paradoxes.html",

A good axe was a useful tool to have on board a ship, it has many purposes, abilities, uses, etc. Just imagine being on a ship and having to deal with rope, wood, and maybe even using it in a pinch for cutting food, or gutting a fish. \n\nIt also, for the benefit of pirates, had the benefit of looking like just a tool because that was its main purpose. If a ship was suspected of piracy and you're claiming to be humble fishermen it's much better if they find axes and other tools than muskets and so forth -- they don't look out of the ordinary. \n\nBut, they could of course be used in a pinch as a melee weapon when boarding, and also to deal with things like nets that might try and make boarding more difficult. It's not going to be the go-to for most pirates, but it's not a bad backup weapon. \n\nAlso while writing this to find some images I found u/Elphinstone1842 's post which goes into much greater detail so I'll just stop here and link to that https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6bj9jh/were_boarding_axes_actual_weapons_in_the_age_of/dpa1qke/",

There is no specific set of changes that \"boarding\" means. In the case of boarding axes, they had quite thin blades that were specifically suited to their primary task of cutting ropes, as well as a spike on the back for grabbing said ropes and various other tasks as well, like a modern fire axe. They were also something of an odd size, being bigger than a hand hatchet but also smaller than a proper felling or broad axe. Some American boarding axes also featured teeth on the back of the axehead.\n\nBoarding pikes, too, were substantially modified from their land versions. They were substantially shorter than proper pikes, at around nine feet rather than fifteen feet (technically they were half-pikes) and lacked the pointed butt-spike for lack of earth to drive it into. They also lacked any kind of cross-guard or other projection, although I'm not quite sure how common they were on contemporary infantry pikes, as they could be caught on rigging.\n\nFor further reading, you want Gilkerson's Boarders Away, which is unfortunately quite old; unfortunately it's not a well-studied subject.",

It's got three basic parts; an iron or steel coulter, which cuts into the soil nd through the roots of grasses, etc, a moldboard  that turns the dirt over, and wheels to keep the coulter from driving deep into the ground.\n\nIt was different than the ancient Mediterranean plow, which was much simpler and not adequate for the heavy soils of northern Europe. The carruca was developed  quite early, at least by the 8th c. There's one shown in the Bayeaux tapestry. \n\nFor historians of technology  the wheeled plough is  rather famous as one of the devices discussed in Lynn White Jr.'s ground-breaking (hah!) 1962 *Medieval Technology and Social Change*. White basically thought the wheeled plough had enabled the urbanization of northern Europe ( Barbarians make wheeled plows. That lets them feed more people. With more food, populations can concentrate. People begin to live in cities). That very, very, very broad claim didn't stand up to examination long, but like lots of White's big ideas ( such as his notion that stirrups enabled knights and so also enabled feudalism ) it's stimulated debate and made for great classroom discussions.\n\nSawyer, P.

(Also, funny pun by the way)\n\nThe reason why I was a little bit confused about whether it could be a carruca is that the sources I read said that those kinds of heavy plows usually required many oxen or horses to pull because of how heavy the steel is. Was it feasible for one horse to pull the plow?",
