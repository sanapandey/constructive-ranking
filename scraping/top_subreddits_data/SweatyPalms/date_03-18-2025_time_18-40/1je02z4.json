Boats sail upwind roughly 45\u00b0 to the wind and have to switch which side the wind is on via tacking occasionally. So relative to each other they are basically either sailing parallel to each other or at 90\u00b0 to each other. Japan and USA were converging on each other and in an attempt to keep clear, Japan decided last second to tack but did so too late and too slow. The guy in the video is the wing trimmer. During a tack, the wing doesn\u2019t really need trimming so he\u2019s the first to usually change sides as that\u2019s the most efficient window of time to do it. Thats why he was running over to his position.",

If the boat is headed down wind, it\u2019s called gybing, where the true wind direction cross the stern when switching sides.",
