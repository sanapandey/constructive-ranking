I know this because I have handled a metric fuck ton of spiders in my life time. A lot of them will absolutely do their best to avoid coming into contact with you. When you do pick them up usually they will yeet themselves off your body as soon as they get into contact with your skin.\n\nThey are very clever critters in that regard.\n\nTarantulas can be shockingly docile, but this is not true across the board for all species of them as I have seen some very skittish and can be quite the handful. Really this kid was just handling it gently and the spider did not feel threatened. If the spider felt it was in danger it might have gone for a defensive bite. \n\nThe kid also knows what he is doing despite his age. The spider did not throw a threat display immidately, always a good sign when handling them. He used the stick first to see if the spider would flare its fangs and also gave it another chance to threaten him. Since it did not, he got more comfortable with handling the spider and went for the fangs by hand.\n\nLove me some tarantulas, they are super cool spiders and they can have their own little personalities and quirks. They also live for a shockingly long time if you care for them right.",

One in particular used to escape all of the time and I usually found her hiding in the radiator just chillin' (or warmin').  My boa constrictor escaped and was missing for a whole year until my mom moved a box in the attic and found him one day, she let out quite the scream.",
