He is paralyzed from the neck down, can't breath on his own and has short term memory loss along with other brain damage. My parents are still friends with his parents and the entire thing destroyed the family. He lives in a nursing home now since they can't physically care for him. He is constantly sick. Several times a day he relearns that he's paralyzed and has a full panic attack. It's the stuff nightmares are made of. I can't imagine having momentary awareness and you can't move, breathing is a machine and no one is there unless the staff happen to find you. He can't remember how to use any of the things that help paralyzed people function like a call bell. It's a truly horrific consequence for being a dumb kid. \n\nThere are things worse than death.",

What you need is an advanced directive AKA a living will. this lets you a point who gets to make your medical decisions if you can't speak for yourself AKA if you're unconscious or too sick to make any logical sense and give them some guidelines as to what kind of care you would want in those situations. The reason I say guidelines is because at the end of the day the person you pick does not have to listen to any of it so make sure you choose someone you trust to carry out your wishes even in horrible situations like pulling the plug. You don't need a doctor to do this you just need to go on preparing for your care.com fill out an advance directive and have it signed by two witnesses be and yourself making sure all the dates match. If you want to make it extra super official you can skip the two signatures and sign it in presence of a notary if you I always tell folks that they're the same legally but in the event of a family member or other random idiot trying to pull f****** I feel like a notary would offer a little more peace of mind and security.",

Anyway did it one day and on the 2nd flight of stairs when I jumped and tried to land on my butt to slide down I ended up slipping and just falling backwards head first, my heart skipped, I felt I was fucked, but time slowed down and midair I had enough mind to rotate enough to land on my feet instead of my head, like a backflip, I landed it perfectly like Spider-man or something to where it didn't even hurt. But if I would've kept going down head-first would've cracked my neck and skull and been dead or paraplegic at like 9 years old. What sucks is my Mom and Brother were in front of me and didn't even notice the crazy save I just did.",

You're a self-fulfilling prophecy. By purposely being vague to others you annoy people from the start. You follow this up by saying you're going to leave this and not answer any direct questions, because you *assume* the other person is \"extremely angry\". People aren't angry, just annoyed. And you respond by purposely annoying them more. To top it off, not only do you *not* \"leave it\", you react just as vague as your initial replies, followed by calling people \"extremely angry\" again. Rinse, repeat. Never once do you say something along the lines of there being a possible misconception, ask for further clarification. Your \"I'm unclear what you want\" comment is another setup, btw. Because I asked you a question clearly. You straight up assumed I didn't want an answer, but point it back to me with this setup. You assume and judge people straight away, like the bad-example-of-any-religious-believer you are. I'm sure you know it's not *your* place to judge. It's your place to appeal to your inhibition.\n\nThat's why you're self-fulfilling. You're out to annoy people and when they get annoyed, you slate them for being annoyed and will leave the exchange at that, followed by annoying others again.\n\nI'm not sure what religion you're trying to preach here, nor do I really care, since they all boil down to the same thing anyway, but I'm sure it doesn't entail your behaviour.\n\nGood luck out there, stranger.

The permanence of death has, historically, been a Western (edit: and middle-eastern?) view. Science has, as far as I know, been unable to prove anything substantial about it, but there is evidence for phenomena that can't be explained by the materialist viewpoint \"I'm made of my body, when the body decays, I'm gone too, completely and eternally\". Similarly, my very limited understanding of philosopy suggests there is more evidence against the permanence of death than for it.\n\nAs for pain in death, it's no secret that dying is often painful, for the person and their relations. Death itself seems to be a different story - I've heard more positive, calm experiences that difficult ones. If we explore the possibility of something after death, whatever form it takes, then what reason would there be to assume there's no suffering?",

It is straight up impossible to *know* what comes after death. There is also no evidence such that you speak of. At least none that is both credible and unexplainable by modern scientific standards. \n\nPhilosophy is also unconcerned with evidence here and any claim of post death evidence is inherently uncredible. Metaphysics, and more specifically to this problem ontology, can do nothing more than pontificate and argue about what occurs after death. There is much logical argumentation that occurs with this topic. Further, to claim evidence for or against it robs the claimant of credibility. \n\nLast, yes dying is often painful but that's more a symptom of means than anything else. If a person dies in their sleep, it will be painless. If a person dies in a car accident it will not be. If someone dies of a lethal injection, it is only painful in the sense that getting stuck with a needle can be. And if someone dies by an apparently violent mean such as drowning, it may not be as painful as thought (having drowned myself, I can attest that it's more scary than painful as I passed out before \"dying\"). As for death itself being painless, that's nonsense. Unless you're speaking of perception or the singular final moment of life. Even then, neither is a separate entity to the act of dying. To claim one is peaceful is to claim both are in one measure or another. \n\nIf we explore the possibility of an afterlife, yes the concept of suffering would still be there. What reason indeed would there be for suffering to arbitrarily cease? However, that assumes any afterlife keeps with our living perception. I find it far more compelling to consider that a semblance of life after death would be anathema to one's experience of life. The concepts of suffering and pleasure could very well cease to exist in a post-death existence. Frankly, there isn't much in the way of compelling arguments in either direction. Hence, the increasingly common belief that existence simply is not after death.",

It didn't take going up many stories until their crash test dummy was getting pretty badly beat up (and/or anatomically killed) from the fall into the water. And a mattress? That caused more injury than without it.\n\nThen they had a professional do it, and he was fine precisely because it was explained that you have to hit the water, breaking the surface of it, and then immediately curl your body to absorb the impact.\n\nThe stupidest thing here is doing a showtime Vegas move in a public pool with people in it, with no safety equipment, and probably no paramedics and an ambulance on scene.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with not having kids. But I knew you didn't have kids, your comment was something someone who doesn't have kids would say. I do believe that people who don't have kids should think twice before judging parents. You have no idea. Raising a child is physically and emotionally exhausting in ways that are hard to put into words. After your child is born, your mind is consumed with one thing: keeping them alive. They climb dangerous places nonstop, put choking hazards in their mouths the second you look away, and somehow always manage to find sharp objects. So you basically get used to being in life - saving mode 24/7. When they get sick, your actions decide whether they make it or not. As they grow up, it\u2019s hard to tell if you\u2019re being overprotective because protecting them has become second nature. You try to loosen up - maybe let them sleep over at a friend\u2019s house or go on a trip with their friends - but it\u2019s never easy to let go. After all, that's the most precious thing in your life. I get the argument about *overprotective parents*, but without kids, it\u2019s hard to fully understand the reality of it.   \n  \nI also said that most men are immature. The man in the video jumped from the fourth floor because he is immature, like most men are. For some reason, he can\u2019t seem to grasp that if he fell, it wouldn\u2019t just affect him, it would change the lives of several people. You see the same reckless behavior on the road - it\u2019s almost always a man-child doing something dangerous and stupid. In my country, men are responsible for 87% of all accidents.  \n  \nFinally, your comments give off serious *I\u2019m-very-smart* energy. *Small-minded epistemological assertions?* Really? That\u2019s so pretentious. I guess you're really young, and you might be a great person - but right now you're just being silly.",

                    "body": "Let\u2019s start with epistemology, since I should have foreseen using the correct word would trigger you: epistemology means your beliefs about knowledge in the world. So whether you believe someone can learn something other than thru direct experience is an epistemological belief. Your beliefs about whether one can learn things are small-minded or narrow, or in other words they don\u2019t extend beyond what you yourself have done. It would be pretense if I didn\u2019t understand what I was saying, or it wasn\u2019t relevant to the conversation, but it\u2019s one of the main subject of the conversation\u2014 so no, not pretentious. I\u2019m sorry learning is so tough for you, but please don\u2019t project it on others.\n\nAnd that flows nicely into the next point- you\u2019re bad at thinking. 87% of men cause accidents in your country, so you conclude most men are risky. Do you see those are not the same thing? What you mean is that most risky people are men. That could be 1% of men- your statement is extremely harmful because your ability to do logic is poor. But like epistemology, you might not like using the term logic, which teaches you how to draw conclusions from information, because it sounds too smart. Both come from philosophy. You didn\u2019t study it. I don\u2019t need to ask. \n\nAnd then again your bad thinking includes the idea that overprotective parents would let their kids go on sleepovers or trips. Not the case. Your examples include stopping them from choking. That\u2019s not being overprotective- that\u2019s the basics on keeping your kid alive. Congrats on that. And since it\u2019s the only way you think, I can tell you\u2019ve never seen overprotective parents, because you don\u2019t know how to identify their behaviors. I can also tell you\u2019ve never been a parent- you seem to have so few examples from which to draw lines that you can\u2019t imagine that parental behavior produces the opposite in children no longer caught under that thumb. Which is sad, I would hate to think that someone would go do something like this bc they couldn\u2019t jump off the diving board. But I think it\u2019s highly possible. That\u2019s what bad parenting does. I have plenty of experience with good and bad parenting, thanks for asking, so I\u2019ve seen both, and the results thereof. But it\u2019s fine- you concede in your statement \u201cI get the argument about overprotective parents, but without kids, it\u2019s hard to fully understand the reality of it,\u201d that I was right from the start. Weird that you started this argument then. \n\nI hope that you learn a few things, but mostly that just because most risky people are men, doesn\u2019t mean most men are risky. I\u2019m repeating this one again because I really hope you get this out of everything.",

He estimates an average of 10 to 15 cases each year since 2011, with an increase since more of these jumps have been posted on YouTube.\n\nDoctor Segura and the British Foreign Office established the profile of the \u201caverage practitioner\u201d as a 24 year old British male.\nOf the 46 cases registered up to 2019, 45 were carried out by males (97%), and 61% were British. German, Belgian and other nationalities are less numerous.\n\nIntoxication and recklessness with alcohol seem to play a pivotal role in the falls. Over 95% of the victims were found to have high levels of alcohol in their blood, and 37% had consumed other drugs. The average medical cost per case of injury due to balconing is \u20ac32,000. The balconies have a median height of 8 metres (26 ft), and the people have a median age of 24 years.\u201d",

Forever damaging your relationship with your step-dad. \n\nWe had a discussion about how in life sometimes it only takes 3 to 5 seconds to really calculate the risk of what you're about to do and listen to your inner voice. \n\nAnd then I related how a very good friend of mine in high school taught me how to back flip off a diving board. From his wheelchair. Because that friend once did a back flip into a mud pit to impress some friends. And the pit ended up being a lot shallower than he calculated and now he's chair bound for the rest of his life. \n\nOne moment. One mistake. 5 seconds of thinking twice could have avoided it. \n\nSome risks, no matter how tough or brave or you are or how cool your friends will think you are; they're just not worth it. Your body is the most precious gift you have in life. \n\nThe risk here isn't dying. Dying is easy. The risk here is missing that landing and living through it.",
