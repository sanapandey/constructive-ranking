When he couldn't find them in the house, he waited inside for them to return. Eventually the families father, Er Tig, returned and they got into a dispute. Apparently Er Tig was scratched by Kirill before he made his tenants evade, so Er Tig and his family is now homeless.\u00a0\n\nThe video we see here is evidence of the court case between Kirill and Er Tug, showcasing the furry ball being civil and respectful. Er Tig didn't file a lawsuit against the scratching (apparently he liked that), but being thrown out of your tent in the middle of January is just inhumane... There's a gofundme for Tig Er but so far he only got about 52.000 RUB (belly RUBs).",
