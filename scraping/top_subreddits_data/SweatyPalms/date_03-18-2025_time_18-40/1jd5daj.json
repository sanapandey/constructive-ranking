The plane actually crashed and those people on board all died. The rest of the 1st movie is about \"death\" catching up with all of those who were supposed to die on the plane but didn't in the most gruesome manner achievable.\n\nThe 3rd FD movie is about this girl having a premonition of a rollercoaster derailing and killing a bunch of people, but her and a few friends end up avoiding the rollercoaster and a different group of people end up dying. \"Death\" has to catch up with this cast of characters now because people who weren't supposed to die ended up dead and \"death\" now needs to perform corrective measures so everything is \"right with the universe\" or some shit. \n\nAnyways this guy in the video got fully steam rolled by the car and all four of it's tires, which usually results in a bloody steaming pile of death, but somehow by the grace of (insert your deity here) was miraculously spared, which translates to what every traumatized kid from the 90s would understand as a \"Final Destination\" moment. Now this guy has to watch where he's going or die of starvation in an empty padded white walled room.\n\nFunnily enough there appears to be another installment of Final Destination coming out this year in the next couple of months. Check it out and join us in our tragic traumatic understanding of near-miss death's and Timber delivery trucks.",
