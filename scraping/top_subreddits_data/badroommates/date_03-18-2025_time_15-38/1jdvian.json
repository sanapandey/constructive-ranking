    "selftext": "So I\u2019ve been living with this guy now for a few months. I\u2019m not on the lease we just had a verbal agreement that I\u2019d pay a portion of the utilities. That was fine. I\u2019ve been giving him an extra 50% of what I owed each month to help with rent and then at the beginning of February I started noticing letters from not only all the utilities but also rent/mortgage. All of them expressed that they were all late. When I mentioned it he got really angry and told me that I didn\u2019t need to worry about it and he would pay them. Well then, end of February, we get shut off notices for 2 different utilities as well as a notice that if mortgage isn\u2019t paid they\u2019ll take his place. This tells me that he hasn\u2019t been paying his bills for months. When I brought this up to him and told him I\u2019ve been giving him money for the bills and asked why that money wasn\u2019t going towards them, he yelled at me that it didn\u2019t matter because once I sent him the money it was his and he could do what he wants with it. Now I\u2019m moving out on Sunday because the electric is being shut off on Monday and I don\u2019t want to pay him my portion of the utilities for March since I know he\u2019s not gonna pay the bills and he\u2019s just going to spend it on whatever. Am I legally obligated to still pay him? I\u2019m not on a lease and we didn\u2019t sign any papers just had a verbal agreement. ",

Verbal agreements can be tricky, but if you\u2019ve been paying him and he\u2019s not holding up his end by paying the bills, you\u2019ve got a solid case to just walk away. I\u2019d say you\u2019re in the clear to bounce without handing over more cash, especially since he\u2019s basically admitted he\u2019s pocketing it. Good call on getting out.. sucks to deal with a shady roommate like that!",

He is ridiculous- no, once you give bill money to him **FOR BILLS** it\u2019s not HIS, and no, he can\u2019t do what he wants with it. Well he can until you enforce consequences, pretty much. I wouldn\u2019t give him a rusty nickel. I would flip him two birds on the way out and tell him he *could*, if he wanted to, kiss my ass.  I might also leave pieces of raw seafood here & there on my way out. Small enough to be impossible to find, big enough to rot and REEK.",
