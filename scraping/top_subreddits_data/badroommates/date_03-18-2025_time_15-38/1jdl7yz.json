    "selftext": "About a year ago my ex and I broke up and decided to finish out the lease since we were in good financial positions independently. This is just one example but he became vegan shortly before we broke up after years of eating meat while I was a vegetarian. I always accommodated him eating meat, but shortly after we broke up he started being crazy about it. No \u201cflesh\u201d as he called it could be visible, neither could things like butter or milk. Before we broke up if he went to the store and I asked for eggs or cheese he would refuse to buy them. Anyways this conversation occurred months after breaking up and taking on another roommate. He would leave his dishes in the sink so we couldn\u2019t wash ours, then refuse to clean his because they \u201cassociate with animal flesh.\u201d",

You only make people want to get away from you and eat more stuff that will piss you off. How can you honestly think you're making a \"difference\" by saying shit like this. I'll bet there is all kinds of things you buy and use that are killing the earth through greed and industry. Your hands are not clean.

Whether you shop locally or not, that doesn't change the fact that the average American eats 8 pounds of avocados a year, while the number was 1 pound in 1989. Avocados require much more water than other produce and environmental consequences of their popularity are enourmous. Am i better than you because I consume hardly any avocados?  The amount of avocados you eat likely wouldn't be sustainable if everyone shopped locally like you. Your self righteousness isn't cute. Even if you are doing it \"the right way,\" your lifestyle is entirely unsustainable in a way that doesn't affect the world in a hugely negative manner. If everyone was as morally righteous as you, your lifestyle wouldn't be possible. This is one example.\n\nEdit to add: I'm not denying my lifestyle also doesn't affect the world in a hugely negative manner, but I'm not I'm denile of it. I try to buy cage free and cruelty free",

So many contradictions in your argument it's pointless to even bother discussing this until you educate yourself further and get past the one rule for you, but not for me mentality.",

Your diet by percentage consumes more avocados than my diet, and more yearly I can almost guarantee. Therefor you are more responsible for the avocado problem than I, are you not? Avocados didn't become popular until fad diets made them popular. I'm not calling veganism a fad diet, but to be fair the large-scale movement toward veganism has contributed to the increase of their popularity.

I'm not arguing that vegans are the sole reason for the rise in avocado popularity, but that they're a contributing factor in a broad populization of it. You guys are a loud 2% of the population, and I have many friends that were vegans or still are vegans. My argument is solely that you can sit on your high horse in preach, but you cannot provide much true evidence that your lifestyle is any more positive or negative than mine. I use avocados because they are an egregious example of the moral issues that surround profit crops. Bananas are a great example. If you eat Chicita bananas they literally committed a genocide for that land. How do you quantify that as impact? You said you shop locally, is Everything you buy local? I'm sorry if I came across as solely blaming Vegans, I'm just saying I can find likely as much cruelty products in your life as in mine, and no one's necessarily better because they don't eat animal products.",

            "body": "If everyone cleaned up their plates there would be no excuse for y\u2019all to talk\u2026. He\u2019s probably been thinking about this for a while and every time he thinks of it he\u2019s disgusted and he wants to go to you for some reason. And I don\u2019t know he really makes it sound like y\u2019all have flesh just hanging and dripping blood in the fridge and if he puts his veggies in there, they might get cross contaminated. And he isn\u2019t really using the correct expression for that. He\u2019s just calling it flesh. We obviously call it meat\u2026flash is a step further to insult. I think he\u2019s over reacting about that. Okay. But one thing I don\u2019t think he is over reacting is the dishes because I would one thousand percent crash out over dishes and food and guck in the sink. Nasty. Idc if it\u2019s just rose petals and dandelions or a bowl of cereal and milk\u2026..Clean your dish so the next person who is cooking that may need the sink and space can utilize properly. Also brings roaches. That\u2019s serious. But it\u2019s a very basic conversation. No one has to pop a hernia over it. He really sounds like he\u2019s in excruciating pain just reading his texts. So anyway. \n\nSolution 1. Everyone cleans their plates. I don\u2019t care if you eat air. If you neee to in emergency okay but other then that everyone please clean and or scrape and rinse your plate before you leave it in the sink and come back for it later. It\u2019s gross. Everyone can do that, then there\u2019s no more issues. I think you can get glass containers with lids for less than 20 bucks. He can buy it if it bothers him so much.\n\nSolution 3. No one cleans dishes. If you guys get along how ever you get along\u2026..He moves to a home that better suits his dietary needs and maybe everyone ends up hanging out after that. One people are not made to live with you. But there still good ex or. Good friend\u2026.\n\nSolution 4. He can get a fridge and plate where he keeps in his room just for his veggie food. It may come in handy where ever he may go after this to have a separate fridge. \n\nSolution 5. Everyone chips in for disposable plates and takes turns taking out the trash. He provides ziplock bags or flesh wrapping materials and everyone is happy. \n\n\nI can come up with a few other outrageous ideas but people should wash plates anyway and the person making a big deal can solve the problem by fussing less and providing supplies for those who may not have the funds for \u2026. In this case \u201cwrapping flesh\u201d the economy sometimes doesn\u2019t allow us a few extra bucks for what ever he needs flesh to be wrapped in. And maybe just give him the top shelf in the fridge so no flesh juice falls on his food. And then also no one has to do anything. I would just let him go in and on and on and I would never respond bc he\u2019s crazy about it. I would only wonder if it\u2019s this small part that he\u2019s trying to control. What we he control next.",
