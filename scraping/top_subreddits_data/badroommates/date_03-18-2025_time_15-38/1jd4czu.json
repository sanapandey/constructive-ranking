If it's happening all the time but nobody's brought it up, it's pretty passive aggressive.\n\nBut if somebody keeps doing this and has been asked not to, it's only a little passive aggressive. I probably still wouldn't be leaving a note because leaving a note generally means the housemate relationship has deteriorated to the point of no return.",

I did it almost every single time, wasn\u2019t a big deal to me. We also had a dishwasher so it was odd. Never got thanked, but I did get screamed at when I left my panini press on the counter an hour after using it. I had salt all over the inside grill thing with the top closed, because I was going to do a salt scrub to clean it shortly, she threw it across the room and demanded I clean up the salt she threw everywhere. She broke my 150$ panini press in half doing that. I asked her to pay for it, never happened so I took her vaccum \ud83d\ude02 when she demanded it back I returned it with the cord cut off (I\u2019m basically an electrician, no big deal to me, but I knew she wouldn\u2019t fix it so I got to keep it and put a new wire on it in 30 seconds) \n\nThe best one was when, \nOne time I refilled the bathroom soap dispenser pump thing. It was her skull shaped jar pump. It had less than 2% remaining, to the point the soap was below the pump straw thing so it wouldn\u2019t pump, so ONE TIME I added a bit of water so the soap level was high enough to pump. She flipped shit.\n\nSo I bought some fancy ass $45 soap and refilled her dispenser, problem solved right? The soap thing is full, we have nice soap. It is not watered down either.\n\nNo, instead she smashed her own glass soap dispenser by throwing it down the stairs at me. Apparently she did this because the new soap wasn\u2019t as thick as the 2% of a bottle that she had left, so she assumed I had filled the jar with 98% water(despite the soap being a different scent and clearly much thicker than water) the staircase smelled AMAZING after that and I acted like I appreciated the scented staircase.\n\nI got her to admit in text she assaulted me with a weapon, and said if she wasn\u2019t out by the end of the month I\u2019d have the police escort her out.",

It was impossible to get anything done or to communicate with the owners and they changed management or appointed a property manager just before we moved out. One of the rooms had a leaky roof and the crazy girl left, so we made a deal with the contraction company owners to pay 25% less rent and not use the \u201ccondemned room\u201d but the new property manager refused to honour that deal and my idiot friends never defended themselves in court at all.

The first few notes I saw my landlord leave for my roommates and I. I ignored but followed what was written on them. \n\nThen I kept seeing more and more. Until one day I saw one tapped with my name on it with a specific complaint.\n\n So I got pissed and took off the note with my name, and then a few others notes not directed at me but in the same area. And ripped them up lmao and left them in a pile outside her door. She wasn't home though. Then I went to go on with my day and felt like maybe I was a bit dramatic FML, and went back and picked up the pile of notes that were ripped up and threw them out in my own garbage so she wouldn't know who it was lmao. \n\nWhat's funny is she never even said anything lol, and things just resumed to normal, but I'm sure she got the message. BC notes are annoying AF. \n\nThen weeks later. I noticed another note in the kitchen about food particles in the drain and I was like really. And how she's so fed up with cleaning up when we all pitch in. \n\nSo for some impulsive reason while washing my dishes and looking at that note plastered on the wall.\n\n I took a black sharpie and wrote on that same note..\n\n That we are also fed up bc the WiFi is slow, rent is overpriced and mentioned a few other details. \n\nThen it turned into a drama and she wrote a response on another separate note beside that note. Taped to the WALL.\n\n That's when I really realized she's petty AF.  I totally didn't continue the thread and just let it be.\n\n Some ppl just don't realize that there's a larger message ppl are sending when taking down the notes and writing on the notes.\n\n That notes are so unnecessary. Its easier to speak to ppl. xD",

It took the same amount of time to write the note as it would have to toss it out, it doesn\u2019t feel worth the stress of confrontation. Some people are just like this and unless you\u2019re gonna marry them there isn\u2019t much point kicking up a fuss. Save it for the bigger stuff.\n\nEdit to add: depending on your level of friendship/communication style it could be brought up as a lighthearted joke \u201cSaving these for a new hobby?\u201d. Or if the issue is that there\u2019s no bin in there and that\u2019s why they\u2019re doing it then maybe buy one/a toilet roll caddy thing. What I\u2019m getting at is for me personally I\u2019d rather avoid the tension by either solving the problem myself or bringing it up in a friendly way. I know I can have a bad habit of doing stuff like this at home sometimes (ADHD can feel worse some days) but I make up for it by doing other cleaning/if anything is ever brought to my attention I feel so bad and am receptive to it because it\u2019s never my intention to make people feel like they\u2019re picking up after me. Not invalidating you just my own perspective :) your approach will depend on the personality you\u2019re dealing with.",
