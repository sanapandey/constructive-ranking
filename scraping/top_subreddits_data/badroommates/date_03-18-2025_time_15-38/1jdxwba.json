    "selftext": "I split utilities 50/50 with 4 roommates in college. My roommate is charging me more money because I take more showers. I shower twice a day 10-15 minutes each time. Is it fair that he charges me more? All the other roommates don\u2019t agree, because if we really wanted to nickel and dime people he uses the TV and stove more. \n\nHe is charging me 40% of the utility cost and 10% for himself and 25% for the other 2 roommates ",

He probably sees you as the easiest target to enforce his BS on .You all should just team up together and pay the 75% and tell whosoever in charge that \"this particular roommate\" is late on payment. Plus he has no right to charge you extra for showering more if there's no direct consequences in it like water finishing due to wastage and so on. Tell the fucker to fuck off already",

You aren't having baths which makes the water bill less and you aren't adding to the gas bill which is higher, unless it's somehow a gas heated shower.

Lights, cooker, heating, some tv. Surely this is a case of swings and roundabouts. At worst he could've asked you for an extra tenner, not 40% and lowering everyone else's payments.
