    "selftext": "I moved in with my current roommate about six months ago, and initially, everything seemed fine. But recently, I discovered they\u2019ve been using my streaming accounts without permission. At first, I thought I was imagining things\u2014recommendations on my Netflix and Hulu seemed off, and entire seasons of shows I hadn\u2019t watched were marked as completed. But last week, my account notifications confirmed it: they\u2019d even created a profile with a different name to hide the viewing history.\n\n\n\nI\u2019d be fine letting them use my account if they had just asked and maybe offered to split costs, but the sneaking around feels so disrespectful. The real kicker? They\u2019ve maxed out my profiles, so I keep getting errors when I try to create a new one for family or friends. I tried mentioning it casually, asking if they\u2019d been watching anything on my account, but they played dumb and said it must be a \u201cNetflix glitch.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo be honest, I don\u2019t know how to handle this without making things awkward. I recently had a bit of extra cash, so I thought about just paying for a separate service they could use, but that feels unfair since they\u2019re the one crossing the line. Should I just reset my passwords and move on, or would a direct conversation be better? Anyone dealt with sneaky \u201cborrowing\u201d like this?",
