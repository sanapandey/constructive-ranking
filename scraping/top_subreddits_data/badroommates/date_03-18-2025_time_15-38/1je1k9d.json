    "selftext": "My roomate has her bf over maybe 1-2 weekends a month. She\u2019s a 1st year while I\u2019m a 5th year uni student. Her bedroom is all the way on the 4th floor and mine is in the basement. I have heard loud murderous yells when they have sex through the vents and it would go on for 10-20 minutes. Anyways this has happened 3 times already in the past and I did not bring it up before so I could try to fix it on my end by putting on headphones or blasting my music but nothing had helped and I finally got fed up with it when another roomate told me they heard it and was very disturbed since she\u2019s more on the religious side. I finally texted her being like \u201ccan we talk about smth that\u2019s been bothering me when u get home\u201d but due to her anxiety she told me to text her right away. I told her and she got very upset with me saying to \u201cmind my business and go talk a walk or wear headphones\u201d. She came home upset and started talking bad about me saying I\u2019m childish for bringing it up to another roomate in the house. I did not think it was going to be an issue as I nicely suggested to maybe put some music on or just quiet down a bit more. I even apologized for bringing it up profusely and this being an awkward subject. One of the other roomates came up to me and said \u201ctalking about someone\u2019s sex life like that? Shame on u. Why do u even have to bring it up.\u201d That\u2019s when a whole meeting broke out and I explained I\u2019ve tried everything on my side to fix it and they kept saying, \u201cendure it, sex is normal and it\u2019s only 10 mins (it\u2019s more like half an hour of pure yelling)\u201d. I genuinely don\u2019t get why they are so offended by me apologetically bringing it up and I did it so nicely I\u2019m not sure what went wrong. Now she\u2019s saying I\u2019m telling her how to have sex and she\u2019s not comfortable. I just don\u2019t get why it\u2019s not weird for them to think it\u2019s weird I can hear them from the basement. Imagine what my other roomate can hear from the walls she shares with her. Am I wrong for feeling like this is weird she wants me to endure it? I mean I have had my bf over and she says she has hear very muffled moans from downstairs (think this is a lie bc even the roomate I share a wall with downstairs has not heard anything) but like if I were to compare her yells, her yells are much more traumatizing to hear. She tried to even justify that she can hear other ppl on their phones at 3am and she endures it but like how is that the same to me hearing u dirty talk? Anyways pls tell me I\u2019m not wrong here for bringing it up because I feel extremely gaslighted thinking I might be the bad guy for making her cry about it. ",

People like your roommate are actually *embarrassed* and instead of having a sense of guilt/shame, they deflect and have the gall to villainize *you*. Hence why they also spread the poison to other housemates (and if they take her side, then they're likely assholes like her anyway).\n\n> Now she\u2019s saying I\u2019m telling her how to have sex and she\u2019s not comfortable.\u00a0\n\nMaybe start recording the loudness of their sex with a decibel reader. There's a huge difference between actual 10 minutes of low moans and 30 minutes of banshee-screaming. The latter is disruptive, and most leases specify that tenants cannot ruin the private *quiet* enjoyment of others. They can either deal or do it somewhere else if they need to be that loud.\n\nSo no, OP, you're not wrong at all to be disturbed by their loud sex. You pay to live in your home, and every tenant has the right to private quiet enjoyment. You can all try to compromise and see if you can plan a few days in the year if no one is home but her and she can bring over BF to do it, but if they don't compromise and get further combative, it's time to record, document, and report to the landlord (plus, two weekends every month may still violate guest policy in the lease).",
