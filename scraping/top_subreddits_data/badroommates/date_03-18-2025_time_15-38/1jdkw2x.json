If either me or my wife is in there at that time she says she has to shit  and rushes us out.  I would mind it less if she washed her hands and didnt leave the toilet smelling straight up like rotting flesh.  Additionally if we wake up and need to use the bathroom early in the morning and she is in there, she will leave the bathroom and sit outside watching cartoons loudly on her phone until we get out so she can go back in.  AM I BEING WEIRD ABOUT THIS? This bugs the hell out of me!",

It's a 4 bedroom house with one bathroom. Then she would spend an hour, to the minute, in the bathroom, go sit in her room for ten minutes, and then go back into the bathroom for an hour. When she got out there would be an inch of water on the floor and sink counter. Fucking infuriating.",

If it has to be a process that takes time, you flush again the next time more leaves. I mean don't go full ham and flush the toilet over and over because that's kinda wasteful, but that's when you pack it up and go \"I'll get the rest of ya out later\" since we can't just live on the toilet haha. Of course the answer here is more fibre, but if that isn't the case, courtesy flush!\n\nAlso 2 hours is way too much. I have my own ensuite so I don't have to worry about anyone else needing it, and have been known to need a bit more time on days where I haven't gotten enough fibre into myself, but goddamn, never 2 hours lol.",
