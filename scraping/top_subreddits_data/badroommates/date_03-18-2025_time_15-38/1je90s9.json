    "selftext": "Seriously what is wrong with him? I have a flatmate, so it's not like we live in the same room and have bunk beds or something. But seriously what the fuck? I mean who the fuck he thinks he is. It is not just once or twice that he is acting up, it is every fucking day since last 3-4 months.\n\n  \nTo give you guys some context, I live in campus housing and we both are in grad schools. Naturally the workload is insane and literally no one has anytime to do anything. Inspite of all this, we need to remember and we are humans and CANNOT BE LIVING LIKE ANIMALS! This roommate, lets call him Joe. When Joe and I moved in to this apartment, he said he wants the bigger room, I was like okay fine whatever even tho I knew I have lots of stuff and a big ass table and whatnot. \n\nWe decided to have some ground rules - we'll take out the trash alternatively, obviously keep the kitchen and bathroom tidy as well. The deal was never to criticize what I do or butt in my business. If I need or want something from you, I'll ask, relax. \n\nIts been almost 8 months since we've moved in and I must say Joe is as horrible or sometimes even more so than my previous flatmates. He constantly complains and has a million things to say to me about everything - how I walk, how I close my door, how I talk, when I can use the vacuum, how to use the scrub, how only I make the kitchen counter and stove dirty, I mean the list just keeps going on and on. \n\nTo me I realized later that Joe is one big red flag. He seems to be a nice guy at heart, but so judgmental, critical, and annoying as fuck. Who the fuck is he to tell me to close the door the right way? I mean leave my door alone you dumb fuck. I close it however I want. \n\nI haven't seen him one single time in the last 8 months that I have been living with him, clean our toilet or the kitchen sink or counter tops. I haven't seen someone keep the same pans and dishes unwashed and re-used for months together. I haven't seen someone 'let the dishes soak' in sink for MONTHS! A portion of the sink color is completely changed! I am NOT MAKING THIS UP!\n\nThis guy never wipes the toilet seat cover even after I have asked him multiple times, he doesn't clean anything that both use, he throws the lint from dryer on the floor to only let it flow around and cause another mess! This guy is annoying as fuck I tell you. \n\n  \nI am not saying that I am a golden roommate and I am the ideal roommate anyone can have, but man's got some balls to point out what's wrong with everyone else around him, but doesn't seem to point even a pinky at him. What advice do you guys have? because I can't take it anymore. I've got all the receipts - screenshots and whatnot. Let me know folks!",
