    "selftext": "TLDR; bf cheated with our roommate.\n\nSo this happened in 2022- I\u2019m doing a LOT better now. time, distance, and reading the stories on this sub from others who have been through roommate hell have all helped a lot :). This story is ALWAYS a hit with people I tell, so much so that I joke about writing a book inspired by it. Let me tell you my bad roommates story, and let me know if I should write a book to capitalize off it. \ud83d\ude1b\n\n(Sorry in advance for the long post\u2026 don\u2019t read unless you\u2019ve got time and popcorn)\n\n**Some context:** When I was 19, I moved out of my hometown and immediately got into my first serious relationship with a local who was a few years older than me. Let\u2019s call him Joe. Naturally, I fell into Joe\u2019s friend group and sort of built my new life around him. We moved fast... Shit was expensive, and he stayed on his parents\u2019 property for cheap. I was dealing with sort of a sketchy living arrangement, and his parents loved me, so it just made sense for my broke ass to move in with him after only a few months. From the beginning, we both made it clear that we were in this for the long haul. Joe was one of the last of his friends to be single- the rest of them were already engaged or thinking about it. Within our first year and half together, we went to three of his best friends\u2019 weddings. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say our relationship was perfect- we had our fights and one of them even resulted in us breaking up for a few days. But we always made up quickly. I loved our life, I loved our friends, and by all accounts, we were a solid couple. We did everything together and everyone we met understood that we were a package deal. \n\n**Now for the part of the story that\u2019s relevant to this sub:**\n\nAfter a year of dating, we looked at moving into an apartment downtown. Like I said, shit was expensive, so we agreed to move in with two other roommates. One of them was Joe\u2019s good friend/roommate from college (lets call him Ollie), and the other was a friend of a friend who was moving to the area and was looking for housing (lets call her Macy). Even though Joe and I didn\u2019t know Macy, the mutual friend who put us in contact had moved away. So we picked Macy up from the airport, introduced her to some people, and showed her the area. She seemed nice enough, and all of our wallets were happy with the living situation. \n\nNow, I thought I was messy. But even *I* couldn\u2019t handle a month-old pile of dishes in the sink attracting roaches. Or never wiping the counters, even after cooking/eating. Or starting a new pile of trash next to the trash can instead of emptying it. Every few weeks I would get fed up, deep clean it all (which is soo unlike me, but just shows how nasty it really was lol) and then swear to leave it for someone else next time, no matter how long it took. Spoiler- that never works. After about four months of living with this group, resentment was starting to build. \n\nBut it turns out that constant disgust was the least shitty part of my shitty roommates.\n\nIt was March of 2022. Being newly 21, living downtown with others in their early 20s, and the fact that nightlife was just starting back up after covid made for some of the most fun nights out I\u2019ve ever had in my life- even to this day. Us four roommates would go out nearly every weekend, but we often had a group of seven because Ollie would bring his gf, Macy would invite her friend (lets call him Rick- he\u2019s important to the story), and I\u2019d invite my friend (lets call her Emma- we love her). \n\nOne night, we decided to go to emo night. We all gathered at the apartment to pregame, and I asked Macy to make me a drink. I told her I wanted to get turnt. And boyyy did I get turnt- I don\u2019t even know what I had. Macy got me drinks all night long, and made sure I was never empty-handed. It was my first time getting blackout-drunk, and I ended up feeling so sick that I needed to go home. I guess the night was winding down anyway, because most of our group ubered home with me. There was one less seat in the car than we needed, but Joe said that he didn\u2019t mind walking the two miles home- it was a nice night. Macy volunteered to walk with him. When they got home, they found me passed out on the bathroom floor, so they gently coaxed me up and put me to bed.\n\nThe next day, Joe nursed me back from one of the worst hangovers of my life, and our weekends went on. Our group would go out, get drunk, and then chill together the next day, going on hikes or to the beach while we recounted the night before. I\u2019m a lightweight, so I\u2019d usually pass out before the night was over, but I liked to hear stories from the rest of the group about conversations they\u2019d have or games they\u2019d played after I went to bed. \n\nThen I started to notice a shift in my relationship. Joe began to get belligerent when he was drunk. He\u2019d always had a habit of making uncomfortable jokes (\ud83d\udea9 in hindsight), but he got so mean that people started asking me if I was okay after hearing him talk to me when we were drinking. He and I had lots of long talks, and he agreed to work on himself and scale back on the drinking. \n\nAfter about a 6 month run, our little \u2018going out group\u2019 started to fall apart. Ollie and his gf stayed holed up in his room, Macy began dealing with family issues and was away most of the time, Rick had Emma had both moved out of the area. Joe and I moved into our own, smaller place around our 2 year anniversary (Sept 2022).\n\nLiterally two weeks after signing the new lease with Joe, I got a random phone call from Emma. *She* had gotten a random call from Rick, who had just moved back to the area and seen on social media that Joe and I were still together, seemingly not friends with Macy anymore.\n\n I was on the phone for a long time that day, piecing together the story and watching my future crumble before my eyes. Just that morning, Joe and I were talking about engagement rings. A few days later, completely heartbroken, I asked Joe to answer some questions honestly. I found out that this is what happened:\n\nOn emo night, when Macy and Joe were walking home on their own, she spent the entire time shit-talking me. She basically told Joe that I wasn\u2019t really in love with him, just with the life and friends he provided me(?). It turns out that after they put me to bed that night, they continued to talk in the living room, and wound up making out/fooling around. Joe made sure I understood that they did NOT have sex THAT night (gee, that made me feel better!), but they did start a habit of drunken hook ups. \n\nOn those nights that I\u2019d fall asleep first, when Rick and Emma had gone home and Ollie and his gf retreated to his room, it turns out that Joe and Macy would take that opportunity to fuck on the couch in the wide open living room. Sometimes they\u2019d go to her room. After every time they did it, Joe would come into our room (right in between the living room and Macy\u2019s room) and crawl into bed with me.\n\n Macy, being Rick\u2019s only tie to the friend group, was telling him everything. He knew that at this point, she was just waiting for Joe to dump me. He knew that by the time I fell asleep, they were just waiting for him to leave. Apparently Joe viewed every instance as a drunken mistake, while Macy kind of reveled in the attention. Macy had other friends that she\u2019d bring out sometimes- they knew about it too. Pretty much everyone in my life (except for Emma) had been lying to my face for months. I never asked Ollie if he knew too because I don\u2019t think I can stomach the answer.\n\nThere were a couple late nights/early mornings where I stirred and noticed that Joe still hadn\u2019t come to bed, but I honestly just figured that he and Macy were up late chatting, or maybe he\u2019d fallen asleep on the couch. One time they\u2019d accidentally fallen asleep together, but they were saved when my alarm for work woke them up and Joe was able to beeline to the kitchen by the time I came out of our room. He said he\u2019d just fallen asleep on the couch. I trusted him.\n\nI guess their affair fizzled out after a while. Rick figured he\u2019d leave it up to Joe and Macy to tell me, since he and Macy were drifting apart over it anyway. But when he realized a few months later that I STILL didn\u2019t know, he couldn\u2019t sit on it anymore. If it weren\u2019t for him, I genuinely don\u2019t think I ever would have found out. Joe admitted that he\u2019d been using alcohol to cope with his guilt, but planned to never tell me what he did. He planned to marry me and let his lies \u201cdie with the past\u201d. \n\nTO THIS DAY, I haven\u2019t spoken to Macy about any of it. She\u2019s never reached out, but did text Rick to thank him for telling me (how thoughtful), and she stays in mine and my friends\u2019 profile viewers. I haven\u2019t run into her since finding out, so while I *am* trying hard to make peace with the situation, I do think she has a knuckle sandwich coming her way if fate leads our paths to cross again\u2026 honestly, I don\u2019t even feel angry at Joe anymore. I\u2019ve said everything I needed to say to him, and at this point I just feel pity for the pathetic little man. But I still don\u2019t know how to even *think* about Macy without getting pissed off.\n\nI moved back home with my parents. I took the cat Joe and I adopted. I\u2019ve been following dreams that I never would have, had I kept dating Joe. Even if he never cheated, I\u2019d be  doing better without him than with him. At the end of the day, I\u2019m just so grateful that the trash took itself out. They made it really, really, easy to see how I deserve so much better.\n\nSorry again for the long post but I really did try to keep it short\ud83d\ude05 I feel like I even left out A LOT! If you made it this far, I hope it was at least able to bring you a little entertainment :,) I can answer questions in the comments. Hang in there y\u2019all and please know that you deserve sooo much better than shitty roommates. <3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
