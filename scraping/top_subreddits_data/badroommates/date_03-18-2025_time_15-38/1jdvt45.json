    "selftext": "I am a single mom and my son is 18 months old. (A year and a half). \n\nWe live with several roommates and one of them is also a mom. She has a teenage daughter who is 14 years old.\n\nI don't really talk to my roommates that much. But when I first moved in they were all really nice. But lately some of them have complained to our landlord about my son being loud. (they already knew I had a toddler when I moved here. Not sure why they expected a toddler to be quiet all the time. And he is not the only loud person. I have had times where I have accidentally overheard some of my roommates yelling at each other over other things that were none of my business but I overheard bits of it by accident cause of how loud they were. So, I know for a fact that my son is not the only \"loud\" person in the house. He just has a better excuse for it cause of his age. But at the same time its also unrealistic to expect constant silence when living with roommates.)\n\nAnyways, today I ordered some groceries and while I was putting the groceries away in the kitchen I was trying to multitask putting the groceries away while also making sure my son stays near me. Well, while I was still putting my groceries away and organizing them, the other mom and her teenage daughter came into the house with a bunch of groceries too. After they got into the house none of us really spoke. I said \"sorry\" a couple times whenever i moved my son whenever he walked too close to her when she was busy putting groceries away because I did not want him to get in her way. But she didn't even respond. She barely looked at me and she seemed slightly pissed off. She also slammed a few things when she went back into her room after she was done putting her groceries away. (i could hear it cause her room is close to the kitchen and I was still putting my groceries away when she did that.) \n\nI am not sure if she was mad at me or my son or if she was mad about her mom telling her to put groceries away or if I am not allowed in the kitchen at the same time as anyone else or what. (For the record I was in the kitchen first. They came home with their groceries while I was still putting my own groceries away.)\n\nI didnt ask what was wrong since I don't talk to my roommates that much anyways and also cause I did not want to argue or come off as nosey.\n\nAnd before anyone criticizes me for living with roommates: it was all we can afford. And my family doesnt want me or my son to move back in. And I am not the only mom who lives here. Its still better than being homeless. ",

I can't imagine having 4 people in a normal/small-sized kitchen all at once, let alone both trying to put away things and working around each other to get to certain areas.\n\nIn all likelihood this was a non-issue but more just an annoyance at the inconvenience at the time. That's probably it.",
