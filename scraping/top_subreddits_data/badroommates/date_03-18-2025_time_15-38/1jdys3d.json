    "selftext": "I think my roommates are lying about the utility bill they got to be lying because the screenshots they sent me are not adding up AT ALL. We agreed that they would show me utility bill in person. I told them we had an agreement and all of the sudden they are saying it hasn't come in the mail and it won't come in the mail and they aren't going to show me it through their phone because they don't want to communicate with me in person at all. We don't got to communicate they can pull it up on their phone and done I try  to ask for an explanation then to why the screenshots are the way they are and aren't adding up and they don't try to explain it to me they tell me nevermind they will pay it all and take me to court. I would pay it. I don't want to go to court. But I think that they are literally lying. Like lying about amounts and stuff. ",
