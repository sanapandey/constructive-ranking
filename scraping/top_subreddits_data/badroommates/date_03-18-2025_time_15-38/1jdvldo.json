    "selftext": "I recently signed a lease and moved into a house with my coworker, her boyfriend and her daughter. It\u2019s been a week since we moved in and everything was going great until her and her boyfriend broke up leading to him leaving. Now she has people over 24/7\u2026 mostly men. She doesn\u2019t respect that the house isn\u2019t a revolving door for people to come and stay the night. I mostly stay in my room because I don\u2019t feel comfortable around all of the people she has over. It\u2019s been a week and I hate it here and wish I never agreed to this\u2026",

In my experience, that's the best place to start a conversation.\n\nPersonally, beyond the borderline of acquaintance & friend, I tend to keep the personal separate from the professional. Moving in with a coworker immediately put ya into an awkward situation. It's now unfortunately time to step up a bit as your own adult & try to make a boundary for your own space. It will be awkward as all get out, but eventually worth it in learning to put those boundaries for your own sanity.",
