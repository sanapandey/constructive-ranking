Did they avoid it?). \n\nThere is nothing locking you into a particular species on your reincarnations, so it\u2019s more likely that Krile got very very lucky and was reborn from someone who originally traveled from the source to the shard, than that Lala souls can only come from other Lala\u2019s who have already died - if one of those Lala\u2019s had a kid before any deaths, would they have given birth to a soulless abomination?\n\nAlso what happened to the fraction of those Lala souls when the 6th/7th calamity occurred that were on the share being rejoined? Do we have 1/14 Lala\u2019s running around the source now, because the other clump of their soul was hanging out on the 9th instead?",

They will have souls originally from the 9th at density 1/14, immigrant souls from the Source at densities 5/14 or 6/14 (if rejoined with a native, which we don't know whether it happens naturally), and now souls from Turali people trapped in the dome at density 8/14, possibly 9/14 if spontaneous rejoining is a thing, and that's not accounting for the possible density variations on the Source due to Aloalo emigration and voidsent deaths. I assume that whenever reincarnation does happen (it seems complicated with Alexandria), souls are not restricted to bloodlines, so anyone born since the dome appeared could have any of the possible densities.\n\nWhat we do know is that by virtue of being an active Arcadion fighter Brute Bomber is likely still in his early twenties, if even in his twenties at all.\n\nI think Nostalgia and her sister are mixed-reflection, but we have NO idea what their souls are like.

They are, by definition, different people with varied histories and backgrounds.\n\nFurther, while there have been no *confirmed* shards of individuals between the Source and its reflections beyond Ardbert and your WoL, there are *heavy* implications throughout the MSQ that shards tend to be similar in personality and characteristics. We see this with the suspected shards of Rowena and Gerolt in both the First and in Alexandria, and between the train lads in Yyasulani and the trolley boys on the First. We can therefore infer that these \"alternative versions\" are shards.\n\nWhile physical similarities may not be required for shards, it is implied through the suspected shards that they may share similar physical characteristics. The OP's example may be a coincidence, or they may indeed be shards. It all depends on whether Brute Bomber is a native soul to the Ninth or a Turali that got trapped there.",

But that's what the devs had designed for the most plain WoL would look like since we needed a representation for the player character, which is the bogstandard Meteor. I imagine they decided to run with the same design for Ardbert's look for that reason as well, considering the historical appearance of the *placeholder* WoL in earlier trailers and what his image represents. That's really the point I was getting at with my side note and why I don't think your earlier justification using WoL and Ardbert holds up to scrutiny.",
