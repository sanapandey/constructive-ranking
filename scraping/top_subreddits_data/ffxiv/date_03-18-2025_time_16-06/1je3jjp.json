Curiously, the World Trade Center towers were missing - and the game was developed before the attacks took place so, yeah, weird.\n\nThe game itself was pretty much all about various conspiracy theories, I believe one of in-game lore bits was about Twin Towers getting destroyed - so, naturally, there was a real-life conspiracy theory that the game somehow *predicted* the real-life terrorist attacks.\n\nIn reality, the Twin Towers were missing from the in-game New York's skyline...\n\n...because the developers didn't want to make that image too detailed as it simply ate too much video memory, lol - and that's understandable, the cutting edge GPU of that time was GeForce 2 GTS with whopping 32 MB of internal video memory.",

Instead of hard zone lines, the game used these 'loading corridors' to transition seamlessly. They were unfortunately rather obvious, and utterly incompatible with flying. In places where you couldn't put a convenient passageway or canyon pass to be your 'loading screen', there were invisible zone lines where you would get a lot of weird pop in (Certain parts of Thanalan were bad for this)",
