So back when I was trying basically every MMO that came on the market, if there was anything even close to a monk that\u2019s what I would play! And if there wasn\u2019t a similar class I would sometimes have a hard time picking at all. (Especially since most games weren\u2019t like XIV, and you\u2019d have to make a different character for each class choice.) \n\nIn FFXIV I really enjoy a lot of the other jobs too, but I will always do first-time MSQ, dungeons, and raids as MNK!",

                                    "body": "Granted I haven't played since before DT, but even though I tried maining it, there were several things that bothered me about MNK:\n\n1) Obviously this changes from update to update, but quite often the rotation is arrhythmic enough to be annoying. Other DPS jobs have rotations that are almost musical, but MNK's is like playing a song specifically to annoy yourself. It bothers me.\n\n2) It doesn't feel like the amount of work you need to put into the job's systems is rewarded enough. You have to balance a lot and screwing up a single attack feels like a huge DPS loss. Granted this has been better since they removed the positioning requirements - running between flank and back constantly (and also arrhythmically) was stressful - but there is still a lot to keep track of, and instead of making me feel empowered, it made me feel handicapped.\n\n3) The animations for many of the attacks are bafflingly underwhelming. Spinning slaps and toe touches with no impact. It's like Wolverine popping his claws and only doing elbow and knee attacks. This has gotten better in recent years with more flashy, energy-based attacks, but the main rotation attacks are largely still weak-looking. Overall it just feels like your character is dancing more than fighting.\n\n4) Every other job has weapons and attacks that lend themselves better to being zoomed out. To actually see what a MNK's attacks look like you have to be zoomed in so far you're going to miss mechanics.\n\n5) While there are a few really cool-looking weapons, most are unremarkable or weird. And connecting to my previous point, it's hard to even see them in gameplay unless you don't care about getting hit by stuff. Making a cool MNK glam feels wasted as I'll barely see it when actually playing anything.\n\n6) I was a massive fan of Sabin in FF6, but this game's MNK is a far cry from Sabin's skillset. NIN's Ninjutsu are much closer to Sabin's Blitzes. Feels like a huge missed opportunity.\n\nSo I know that's a lot and may make it seem like I hated MNK. I sometimes did like the job, but mostly felt like there were other jobs that were less stressful and more fun. MNK just didn't seem to be worth the effort, and when I would test that assumption I'd eventually prove it right.",

While you could get into a flow state with just a bit of practice, it was rather difficult to get used to.\n\nIt's the only job without a ranged attack still. not really a *problem* outside solo deep dungeons or 2+ GCDs worth of stepping away from a boss, but it definitely feels pretty shitty when those situations do come up.\n\nIts specific weapons/relics really aren't crazy appealing to many. When your competition is stuff like DRK's greatswords, DRG's spears, or SGE's flying cutlery, it's a bit harder to sell people on claws/gauntlets/tonfas that are 80% whatever effect the weapon has going on.\n\nQuite a bit has improved the job's appeal on paper, but at this point it's really just *another* melee job option which already has the most options for a role and doesn't do a ton to set itself apart.",

Made the leveling journey much smoother for us.\n\nAs for why I actually like Scholar, it's nice to have a pet do a decent amount of the healing, leaving me plenty of time to toss up big shields and do a decent amount of DPS, especially when it's time to AoE. \n\nGoing to try Sage soon though.

And ever since I picked it up, it still feels unnatural stepping back into a Warrior from time to time.\n\nGunbreakers feel so much more engaging than the other tanks thanks to the frequency of its burst windows and the strictness of needing to give everything you've got in the 2-minute window. The explosive action is absolute eye candy to be sure (though I wish they implemented the pseudo Limit Break floatiness of the Lionheart combo a bit better - having additional hangtime in the air between the GCD's would help the overall look other than awkwardly landing on the ground at the end of each GCD).\n\nThen there's the lore behind the name - of originally hailing as the royal Blades of the Bozjan Queen Gunnhildr, famed for breaking through the ranks of the Garleans' guns. And the actual jobstone art ties it all together - a slash diagonally across a pistol's barrel (with the sight and extracting rod visible) tying it up nice together as a literal broken gun.\n\nThen there's the animation. The GCD's and oGCD's flow together really well for the most part, especially during the Gnashing Fang combo. Combined with the names of the Gnashing Fang combo oGCD's (Jugular Rip, Abdomen Tear, Eye Gouge), it feels so much more viscerally vicious than the other tanks.\n\nWhich brings me to the cherry on top. With all of this in mind, other tanks feel (for the most part) like they protect. Gunbreakers DEFEND, and with the brutal ferocity of hot-blooded animal and cold machine meeting in a thermal shock explosion.",

So I get it's weapon first while gearing, at least I like the aesthetic and big swords lol\n\nBut GNB is the most fun, it's also the hardest/most punishing tank so I usually only run it once I'm geared cause I'm nervous about holding groups back, I'm just not good enough with it, and that's fine :P\n\nI also use WAR for basically soloing dungeons as well as learning normal mode raids/trials cause when the damage is lower you won't occasionally just spontaneously die when the healers doze off like you might on DRK, in fact you can personally keep any DRK cotanks alive all on your own lol\n\nPLD is my least played tank but I keep it leveled for the sake of any progs I partake in, it's utility is unmatched and if the other tank isn't on it then I will use it if we're in need of it to make faster progress.  But I usually use SkS materia for GNB, while DRK and WAR can use it as well, it's a flat nerf to myself on PLD, so I just stay away if I can cause I don't want to farm a whole nother gear set for different materia on a tank I don't enjoy as much, I'm not serious enough about prog and don't do ultimates so w/e lol",

I was SO thrilled when they revealed we'd be getting it in Stormblood, and I picked it up and fell in love with it immediately. I absolutely love the way it plays, bouncing back and forth between black and white magic and rushing in for a melee combo.\n\nFor a bonus, I used to be a summoner main before SB. Using magic to materialize and command powerful magical creatures is also something I've always loved, and summoners in other FF games are some of my favorite characters. I do like the rework we got in Endwalker, and while the job fantasy is finally there as a proper summoner, using summons as the main attacks, I really miss the complexity the job had before. In its current state, it's fun for a little while, but it's so easy that it becomes kinda boring before too long, and the additions Dawntrail gave to SMN (or lack thereof) left me very disappointed.",

MCH\u2019s LB3 is also my favorite LB3 in the game.\n\nMy entire character is centered around being a MCH too. I have a modern soldier glam on as my main glam almost at all times. I\u2019ve also made lore that my WoL was an ex-bozjan soldier before the events of the MSQ. I love everything about the job honestly. \n\n(Just hope one day it gets a gap closer like the other two ranged dps, and also, buffs so it\u2019s not the lowest performing ranged dps in savage. Maybe rework the AOE rotation to be slightly more intuitive too, even though my empty brain likes spamming shotgun and auto crossbow. \n\nDon\u2019t care about the parsing part too much though because I don\u2019t do savage, and I feel like in normal content my performance as MCH is pretty good since I\u2019m always in almost top aggro.)\n\nEDIT: Honorable mentions though are GNB (my tank main), SGE (my heal main) because they also have guns and I love it. \nMCH will always be my main but RPR is my secondary dps main\u2026 amazing sound design, cool class fantasy and fun rotation! Plus scythes are just badass.",

It was a technical class from 2.0 through 4.5 that actually required braincells to play well. Especially when Carby could replace tanks temporarily in dungeons and take stack markers in high end content in place of an actual player. They used to be a true pet class which was something that was slowly taken away from them over time. I really hope they reintroduce the concept as a different job in the future.\n\nI took up DNC after that for the same reason. Not as technical as SMN and more straight forward but it was and still is exceptionally mobile and fun to fit into a party comp. Plus I've always enjoyed being a buffing support since I played FFXI as a high end Bard main.\n\nAnd I picked up picto because it wasn't like eating Crayons like smn is, wasn't internally nerfed because of its job fantasy like RDM is, and it wasn't just plain shit like BLM. Idc what anyone says. Blm isnt a blm if it only knows three and a half goddamn elements and doesnt take advantage of the whole elemental wheel while sporting 0 utility and the kind of braincell that makes two BLMs in Jeuno get the rest of our party killed because they couldn't step two inches out of their leylines to stack for Ark Angel GK's stack marker. And they both still lost in DPS to me so i dont know wtf they were even tryna do. PCT also has a flexible rotation that can be adjusted based on what's happening in the current encounter which I love.\n\nBut nothing beats 2.0-4.x SMN. I'd nerf PCT into the ground to get old SMN back.",

Then the devs surprise attacked me in 7.05 by dumbing that down too, so after the raid tier was done I switched to Ninja. \n\nI'm having a great time with Ninja. It's more engaging and less repetitive than Viper, and the unique Ninjutsu mechanic is fun. I love the unique jump animation too. I'm praying they don't murder it in 7.2.
