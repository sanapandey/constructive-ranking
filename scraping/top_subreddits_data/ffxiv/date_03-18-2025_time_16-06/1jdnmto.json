    "selftext": "Since I started playing, I'd wanted the confidence to learn to do the Bee's Knees irl, because I feel stupid on a dance floor. So now I know how to do it. It's just 8 steps.\n\nIn late December I started to have what I dismissed as panic attacks. On January 29th, one woke me from a dead sleep. It turns out that I was very close to having a widowmaker heart attack and needed a stent in my LAD. It had a 70 to 80% blockage.\n\nI'd dropped some weight before. My heaviest, I was 289 pounds. Due to sheer stress alone I lost about 25 over the last couple years. When I was hospitalized I was down to about 250. I have been prescribed cardiac rehab, which is basically just exercise while hooked up to monitors. Last Monday, I was 230 pounds.\n\nI pulled a shoulder muscle and since some of the exercise involves more strenuous arm movement, I did not go to class for the rest of the week. I was not going to go up there for $25 per session and find out I could only do a treadmill and exercise bike.\n\nSince getting out of the hospital, I have danced the Bee's Knees in my hallway (to brace myself for falls; I have balance/neurological issues and that dance has a little spin) on days when I don't go to rehab. And even on some days when I do \u2014 it's easy to stop what I'm doing for a song, and just dance for a few minutes.\n\nI went back to class today even though my shoulder isn't fully healed. My doctor needed to know I wasn't just ignoring the rehab order. Even though I hadn't been in a week, I was able to do the treadmill at a higher incline and faster pace, for longer. I was able to ride the bike at a higher difficulty for much longer, and during my last 4 minutes I even turned the difficulty up another notch.\n\nI had also lost another 7 pounds. In a week. Because I'm dancing.\n\nThank you, Final Fantasy XIV. That 80k MGP I spent for the Bee's Knee's was the best MGP I ever spent.",
