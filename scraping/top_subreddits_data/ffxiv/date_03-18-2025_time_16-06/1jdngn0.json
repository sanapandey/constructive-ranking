            "body": "originally the songs did deal(a very small amount of) damage, but it was removed as part of making them castable without a target. Considering that they're damage buffs already, they basically do deal damage. The only difference with a buff and a dot would be a) consistency/party independence and b) the dot would be more easily attributed to you.",

                    "body": "Honestly SB BRD had a great design outside of reliance on needing a DRG in the party due to piercing being a thing and no way to quell aggro generation during your openers and burst. (SB BRD aggro was ridiculous back then, especially if a WAR did the scummy opener and went into Deliverance within 2-3 GCDs and you didn\u2019t have a NIN to Shadewalker them/Smokescreen you.) Yeah some people weren\u2019t a fan of the crit RNG, but I honestly think nothing felt better than to have a god-tier opener where no one else in the party even came close to your burst damage. \n\nThe DoTs actually had nuance and actually interacted with your kit and raid buffs, Iron Jaws had optimization and nuance, and MP had a purpose considering Foe Requiem was a raid buff that steadily drained it. You used Refresh for healer MP Regen but also to regen your own mana so you could Foes some more during burst windows/Trick Attack windows. We had Palisade as a role action, which was basically a free tank cooldown. The song rotation had more flexibility than it ever had since moving to the 2-minute rotation due to being on a shorter 80-second rotation. \n\nNow the DoTs have no real interaction with a BRD\u2019s kit, and thanks to their increased duration and the potency of Burst Shot, it\u2019s not nearly as worth it to double snapshot unless there are several active buffs, versus SB you single-snapshot for a single crit buff, and double snapshot for 2+ buffs. Foes doesn\u2019t exist, so there\u2019s no usage for our MP bar. Radiant Finale feels boring compared to Foe+Refresh management because it requires virtually none. Even our party support feels lacking compared to what it was in SB.\n\nI miss having Refresh and Palisade on BRD because you felt more like a proper party support versus now where you have\u2026Troubadour and Minne, I guess\u2026 I will say them changing Minne to also scale with oGCD healing and not just GCD healing was a nice change, though. (Tactician was another story since TP was made mostly irrelevant in SB, but decent enough for aggro management without messing up Foe+Refresh timings.)\n\nBased on what I remember about all the ShB changes, a lot of changes to BRD were done to appease players who didn\u2019t really main the job, couldn\u2019t keep up their Straight Shot buff, coukdnt keep DoTs on the boss, couldn\u2019t manage Foe+Refresh\u2026 generally just a dumbing down for non-BRD mains to make the job \u201cmore appealing\u201d, plus a way to destroy the job due to the introduction of DNC. BRD went from the most popular DPS to the least popular. And not just because DNC shat on it, either. \n\nHonestly, ShB had a wonderful story\u2014but it sucked in terms of job changes. And I feel like they\u2019ve been continuing to go downhill since.",
