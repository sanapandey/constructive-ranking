The books just before are ALWAYS poetics to prevent giving dead currency, one that will be flat out removed and the other that will no longer be obtainable. And they're not giving the new currency because it doesn't exist yet.\n\nAnd no, books don't change. What you see is what you get.",

Wall to wall pulls in dungeons are also fun.\n\nWhether you enjoy any of that or not is up to you, but those are generally the differences that I find fun when I play tank myself.",

It's similar to the \"be the big guy who doesn't die\" fantasy a lot of tanks have but less \"unga bunga\" lol.\n\nIn general, tank is the role that usually has it the easiest in harder content, as they don't have things like positionals and usually simple rotations but they have a huge amount of self-sustain and a lot of defensives. Choosing what to spend where can be interesting while learning because you won't know what will be back for the next big hits lol.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI think planning my defensives is fun and it's cool to never die in casual content.",

Not only just grouping it in a big mob but trying to corral the enemies so their hitboxes are touching, or baiting cone/targeted AoEs away from the others, it\u2019s a fun exercise.\n\nAlso, as much as people meme about tanking dungeons being braindead, I do find it engaging to figure out optimal ways to use my defensives to make big pulls easy. Knowing which mitigations can stand alone and which ones should be paired up, when to use your supplementary and short cooldowns, etc. is what separates a good tank from a novice tank and tbh I\u2019m still learning more about it as I go.\n\nThere\u2019s fun interactions in group content with your party mitigations and reprisal where you can really see how much you\u2019re contributing to the party. We had two raid groups going recently that were doing Shinryu Ex MINE, and in my group the raid wides weren\u2019t scary at all, but in the other group they were struggling a bit with how hard they hit. The difference was that me and my cotank had a good system for using our party mits and it made a big difference.\n\nOtherwise, yeah, a tank is just a blue melee that has a simpler rotation most of the time. But that\u2019s alright for me, I enjoy all the content in the game even the \u201csimpler\u201d stuff.",
