He chose his grand company and got his chocobo :D I talked him out of naming it \"moist\" and suggested the name of my childhood dog instead, so his chocobo is called Midas! Idk what else to say except we're having lots of fun playing together. Right when we logged off, he hit level 30, so next time, I'm gonna make sure he gets to Bard :D",
