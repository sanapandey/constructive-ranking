A blank plate, DMV portrait, and gear cobbled together with whatever you happened to get is a pretty clear indicator you're fairly new. \n\nAlso, somewhat obvious but if you're leveling with dungeons then you'll be below everyone else's level. \n\nThe last clue is simply the way you play. There's a lot of unspoken conventions for how to run dungeons to get them done as fast as possible (e.g. pull until this spot, position this way against this boss, kill this trash mob first), and seeing a player break those conventions is usually a sign that they're new. Not knowing that stuff isn't a problem and it's not your fault (you have to learn them by osmosis over time), it's just notable.\n\nThese are the indicators I tend to use, since some players will be on an alt where the game says they're new but they aren't, and some returning players will have forgotten everything about a dungeon but the game doesn't say they're new.",
