            "body": "The cool idea for this sculpt belongs to the commissioner, I generally decline commissions where I can't think of a feasible way to realize it, and this one was definitely more involved than other sculpts I have previously made - I had a few ideas on how to make this without completely messing up expressions especially around the mouth. The idea by the commissioner was for the face to be the \"mask\" hiding the actual creature's gaping mouth behind it.  \nIn the end, after making changes to the facial proportions, I split the face from the chin and started modelling the interior, it was tricky especially with the mouth mesh on the inside , in the end I simply compressed it so it wouldn't clip through the palate. I didn't actually unmirror the face as asymmetry didn't seem necessary for this sculpt, and thus instead extended the map size to instead bear the new UV's for the jaw parts.\n\nFor the jaw movement I removed all the bone weight from the original jaw and lower lip, instead I assigned those to the main face controller bone, and then proceeded to weight the new jaw to the jaw controller bone.  \n[This allows for the new jaw to move when talking,](https://i.imgur.com/FRDLjXY.gif) however since the range of motion dictated by the animations and bones is rather small and wouldn't allow for the jaw to open overmuch I decided to make two variants of the sculpt, one with the mouth open and one with it mostly shut.\n\nThis took me.. longer than I'd like to admit, honestly I was just happy when it finally worked without problems whahaha",
