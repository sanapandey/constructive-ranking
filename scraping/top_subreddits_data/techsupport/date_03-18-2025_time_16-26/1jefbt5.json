    "selftext": "Title; I was playing REPO when suddenly it shut down mid game and restarted. It started up fine, and I was able to restart REPO, but as soon as I clicked the save file, it crashed again.\n\nThis time, it didn\u2019t post at all, but powers on.\nI\u2019ve had this PC for 3+ years with 0 problems and I have no clue what could have made this happen, especially because I haven\u2019t changed any parts in a year, nor have I updated the BIOS recently. The mobo has a red LED indicating a CPU failure.\n\nSPECS:\nRyzen 3700X\nRTX 3070\nB450 Tomahawk MAX\n750W EVGA PSU\n\nThanks in advance!\n",
