    "selftext": "Hi, I know this might seems strange but I have a windows PC that is showing every indication that it is online but I can use simple things search engines. What's weird is that every device on the network can ping this one but I can ping anything. I can even remote into the PC but I can't use Google for some reason. I can't even use network troubleshooter because It appears as online and doesn't recognize the issue. \n\nAt this point I have my firewall completely off. DNS, flushed and PC restarted. And advice would help. ",
