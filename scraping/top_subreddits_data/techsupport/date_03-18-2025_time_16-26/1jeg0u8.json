    "selftext": "Noticed today these Violet and Green horizontal lines at the lower end of my monitor. I don't even know when they appeared because in my usual black/white color scheme they are barely noticeable. After some study I put a solid blue background and they became much more prominent. \n\nImages: [https://imgur.com/a/asus-vg249q1a-AjwfFZJ](https://imgur.com/a/asus-vg249q1a-AjwfFZJ)\n\nThis isn't something that is fixed via software right?\n\nI still have warranty, so it's ok, but having it gone for one month is still meh.",
