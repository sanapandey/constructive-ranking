    "selftext": "I took a short video with the issue but I'll explain it since I can't post attachments.\n\nBasically, my (tech illiterate) dad decided to install two of those phone optimizers/boosters this morning. Since then, he has received non-stop ads popping up on his phone, essentially making it unusable.\n\nAs soon as you enter the home screen, an ad will appear. As soon as you exit that one, another will show up. I've since removed the two optimizers he installed but the issue has continued. The ads will also appear when the internet/data is turned off on the phone.\n\nI'm not the most knowledgeable on technology and malware, but I know that there may not be a solution to this without doing a hard reset on the device. I'd like to avoid that if possible because he has some photos on the phone that mean a lot to him and can't be replaced.\n\nHow can this issue be fixed? Is there anything I can do/can be done without doing a full reset?\n\nAny help or guidance is much appreciated",

Then, after his explanation, say \u201cthe exact same reasons are in play for the data of any mobile device.\u201d\n\nThe key thing is to _not_ present iCloud as a backup system, but as an _insurance package._ The iCloud subscription (beyond the base 5Gb) is _insurance against loss._\n\nIt\u2019s all about reframing the argument. He already has an argument against cost. So don\u2019t make it about cost. Make it about _fighting loss._ Make him _afraid_ to lose all of his data.",
