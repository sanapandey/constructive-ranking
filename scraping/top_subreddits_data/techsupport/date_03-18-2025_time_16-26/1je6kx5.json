Also, use Optimize iPhone Storage in Photos to store full-resolution images in iCloud instead of your device. If you need more space, clear Safari cache, delete large messages, and review downloads in apps like WhatsApp and Telegram. Another free way is using cleaner apps like Clever Cleaner App, which has no paywalls. It deletes duplicate photos, finds large videos, and even compresses Live Photos to save space. This free app is here https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clever-cleaner-ai-cleanup-app/id1666645584 You will thank me later. Good luck!",

If you don\u2019t see Offload Unused Apps, try updating iOS first. If it's still missing, you can manually offload apps by going to Settings > General > iPhone Storage, tapping on an app, and selecting Offload App. Not as automatic, but still frees up space.",
