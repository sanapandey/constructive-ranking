    "selftext": "My monitor has Displayport and HDMI outputs, my PC using the DP. I would like to plug in my Switch to the HDMI to display it so I can play MHGU while being on Discord (PC audio) with my friends.\n\n I have my headphones plugged into my USB desk-microphone, so I can't just plug my headphones into the line-out from my computer. Is there a way to display my Switch while still using the audio from my PC? Or both at the same time, if possible?\n\nEDIT!!!: I just realized I am very stupid, and my desk-mic having the line-out will default the audio to my PC. Still, is there a way to merge both sources somehow? I'd like to hear both of them if possible.",
