I'm assuming you're finding the IP address in the email headers, this would be the IP for whoever is hosting the mail service IE: Google, Microsoft, Yahoo etc.\n\n\nEven if you could block whatever IP you're seeing in the email headers the person can just make an account with a different email provider and evade the block\n\n\nLike others have said you can try reporting them by finding the abuse contact info for the IP through whois, but you should also report it to the police too.\n\n\nThe best way to make it stop completely, unfortunately, is to create a new email address for yourself and start migrating all your accounts to it. Or set up super aggressive spam filters on your current email, but that's not guaranteed to work and could make you miss real communications",
