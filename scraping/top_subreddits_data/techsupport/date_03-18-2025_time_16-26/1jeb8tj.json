    "selftext": "I just had a power outage that was cause by some cable trouble due to bad weather. When we got the power back there was suddenly no no internet, even though my computer says that both the ethernet and WiFi has internet connection.\n\nWhen I open my browser I get a popup from Asus saying unable to connect to internet and suggests to contact my ISP to find the root of DHCP failure. Now I live in a student apartment that provides all the internet and that, so I'm not sure who the ISP really is, so I cannot really do that.\n\nI'm not the most tech savvy person and I'm not really sure how to go about this issue. Also I cannot contact the student organisation since it's after hours. Anyone know what could have caused this problem? \n\nEdit: the internet status on the Asus page says 'Your ISP's DHCP does not function properly'",

If there is a problem with DHCP, that means you are not being assigned an IP address, along with other important network information.\n\nIf there are devices like switches and routers in between your apartment and the internet connection coming into the building, the issue lies somewhere there.\n\nYou will have to call whoever is responsible for the network. Either an on site IT department or the internet service provider.\n\nIf you do have access to a router, try unplugging it and waiting a minute, then plugging it back in",
