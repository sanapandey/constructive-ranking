The other is \u201cwe want self driving cars to be better than people\u201d which in many cases means better data input. \n\n\nIn the above video they demonstrate LiDAR successfully seeing an obstacle in the fog and the Tesla not. We also see the Tesla not emergency breaking for a kid in the road because it wasn\u2019t certain enough it was actually an obstacle that needed to be avoided. \n\n\nThe first one only gets fixed with sensors that can penetrate fog. The second one could maybe get fixed with good enough camera AI, but also could easily get fixed with better sensors like lidar. \n\n\nBetter data feeding into a system is a no brainer move, the upfront cost is higher but the quality is better. \n\nAnd the upfront cost being a problem solves itself over time. Musk made the decision when lidars cost up thousands, which ya, adding $10-15k sensors to a car will make them expensive. Newer lidars are way cheaper. A $1000 in extra sensors is a lot more palatable on a $50k car, but if he switches now he\u2019d be admitting he was wrong and admitting all current cars won\u2019t ever actually have good self driving.",

And you now have a lot more or false positives with phantom braking for absolutely no reason. \n\nAnother thing is that humans, when they have a doubt, usually slow down, to help re-evaluate the situation. These computers, they stay full speed until they decide either to do nothing or to slam the brake like a maniac. \n\nAnd applying full brake when no one expects it, in a false positive situation, is almost as dangerous as what is shown here. \n\nThat's why you normally want the car to have more sensors and tools than the human.

Or you could buy a lifetime subscription that was the same price as it was to add it on as a package when purchasing the vehicle. If you lived in a hot area, you would have saved a lot of money by only paying for winter months. If you lived in a cold area, you paid the same by getting the lifetime subscription.

The mechanism is essentially the guts of a laser printer scaled up a bit.  Its the sort of thing where mass production and economies of scale can bring the prices down very far.  It might be a bit more expensive than cameras at scale, but the cost difference should ultimately be pretty small in scheme of building a car.

As in the video, heavy rain or fog are extremely challenging for cameras, or for our eyes, but not much of a challenge for LIDAR.\n\nThere's also a lot more processing involved in properly interpreting a video feed and identifying potential hazards than there is doing the same to the point-cloud information that you're getting from LIDAR. There's way more 'junk' data that's just not useful for the function that the system has to fill.\n\nIf the system needs to be able to identify the colour, age and gender of a moose to see whether it's OK for the car to smash into it at full speed, then a camera based system would be ideal. But it doesn't. It needs to figure out whether there's a solid object in the way.  The mountain of extra data that you're getting from the camera solution is just cluttering up the useful information and adding a load of excess processing overhead. \n\nThe whole thing stems from a poor understanding of form vs function from Musk. There is a genuine drive for us to create things like robots that are human in form; the way that we've build our world is with humans in mind. If you can nail a human-form robot, then it's able to work in our current environments without having to adapt things. A robot with tracks or wheels is going to be way more stable, but it'll struggle a lot with stairs, or navigating narrow corridors. You can almost guarantee that this was the initial driver for Musk pushing for a 'human-like' self-deiving solution; he's heard this concept in other areas of robotics, and just applied it to driving. \n\nBut that same logic doesn't apply to driving. When the car itself can drive, rather than having to have a robot that can interface with the designed-for-human controls when being behind the wheel, we've already eliminated most of the need to replicate human function. \n\nPretty much everything else about driving can be figured out by identifying shape and movement. Colour, details and aesthetics don't play any real role in the function of driving. And even when they do, it's a secondary aspect. Traffic lights have a consistent position for where the red, amber and green lights are. Even if you can't tell that the light is red, you can tell that it is from which light is on. \n\nWhile it's far more obvious these days that Musk is a fascist cuntmuffin pretending to be far more clever than he is, it was immediately clear in the past if he ever started talking about an area that you had any expertise in. If you know nothing about electric cars, and he's going on about Tesla, or you know nothing about rocket science, and he's racing about SpaceX, then it's easy to think that the man's a genius. But as soon as he opens his mouth about a topic that you actually do understand, it's immediately clear that he has the barest, most surface level understanding in it, and that almost any time he tries to go any deeper than the absolute basics, he's completely full of shit, and lacks the critical thinking to be able to make logical assertions based off the information that he does know.\n\nA lot more people are discovering this now, with the constant insane claims around financial or database 'problems' that DOGE and his gaggle of toddlers are 'finding'. Simple stuff, like assuming that massive chunks of benifets are going to people that have been dead for 200 years, rather than realizing that that's just what the DoB is listed as when the data on it is missing. Or the shit from today where he's claiming that they've found machines that print money from thin air. \n\nFor many people with any understanding of neuroscience, or even just medical ethics or a basic understanding of how medical research is carried out, him saying anything about neurolink completely shatters the illusion that the bloke has even a shread of competence.",

As I said, you can construct a scenario that focuses on a lidar weaknesses just as easily, and it would also mean very little.  You can find a corner\\edge case where virtually any technology starts to fail.\n\nInstead, they should have shown the Tesla crashing during rain or fog.

User-disengaed ones though look just like the video.\n\n\nRegardless, the top comment insinuating that Autopilot is turned off right before a crash to pad the metrics is simply false, and the article, which you've read, explicitly states that when reporting the crash statistics, all crashes where Autopilot was engaged 5 seconds prior is still considered being caused by Autopilot.",

Had FSD profile been enabled on the test car, it would not have been possible to drive to within two seconds of collision and then engage it, as was done in the TACC test in the video; it simply would not have engaged.",

Dead stopped traffic on the highway doesn't trigger their self driving braking at all. Apparently it's because they disable the sensors at long range to remove false positives. It's only when the car is \"medium\" range that the sensors kick in and effectively slam on the brakes.    Unfortunately \"medium range\" is uncomfortably close to that stopped car.  \n\nBut the MachE has radar and not lidar.",

Sure, perhaps in the 5 levels of autonomy they are *classified* the same level (2). They are still vastly different in terms of the real-world performance. FSD can do much more than Autopilot. FSD software is much more powerful. \n\nNotepad and Word are both word processors, but Word is much more powerful and can accomplish tasks that Notepad cannot.\n\nIt's very clear what the video producer was insinuating, and knowing that it's also very clear that using Autopilot instead of FSD is quite misleading.

Unfortunately, he didn't.\n\n>Locking safety features behind a paywall is shitty company behavior.\n\nThis logic just doesn't make sense. Most cars don't have FSD. If the other car they used in the test didn't have a Lidar on it, it would have crashed in the wall as well. If a Toyota on cruise control was used in the test, if would've crashed through the wall as well. \n\nHe wasn't testing safety features, he was testing developmental self-driving technology.",

FSD is an end-to-end AI model with billions of dollars behind it. AP is handwritten code from 5+ years ago. It is one hundred percent plausible (and is actually the case) that FSD looks at the information coming in via the cameras and acts on it in a fully different way than AP, which is traffic/lane aware cruise control with no intelligence behind it. \n\n**My eyes don't shoot lasers to see a child through fog when I'm driving, I take it cautiously and putt my way through. FSD does this too. AP does not, as it is not self-driving.** Just like your eyes can see the wall and the supporting hardware around it, FSD does too. If you load a screenshot into chatGPT, Claude, Gemini or Grok it will say \"this looks like landscape with a cleverly hidden wall painted to look like its surroundings\". \n\nJust like your eyes can see a large anomaly in the middle of the road in the fog/child/water tests while watching the video, FSD can too. It would brake and stop or not pass through these areas without extreme caution. Rober opted to use AP because he knew it forgoes billions of dollars worth of R&D designed to make the car understand complex situations and handle them as a human sitting in the driver's seat would.   \n  \nWhat you think is impossible with FSD is in the same vein that AI LLM chatbots have done the impossible in the last few years. This is an AI model in the same way, but trained on driving imagery rather than text. Completely different software does completely different things with the input data.",

That 1% of the time, while impressively small, is still plenty enough to cause a ton of accidents. The technology has a long way to go but I'm optimistic it could be a bit safer than human driving in the future, though I would still prefer LiDAR any day",

That isnt the case. The test simply proved that Lidar is a better at detecting obstacle. Whats more daming is how Tesla kept silently turning off autopilot right before impact. Which nobody is talking about.\n\n\nAlso how Mark says Autopilot is an excuse for you to be distracted while driving. Like saying 'hey i didnt run you over, the autopilot did' which is complete bullshit.\n\n\nAt anycase his videos are less about science and more about generating views with science sprinkled in.",
