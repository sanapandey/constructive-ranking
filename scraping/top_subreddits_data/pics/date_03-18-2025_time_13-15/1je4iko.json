That's not a real product you can buy in Canada.  And it was such a huge lie you could prove was not true and then the next year he actually billed taxpayers [over $1000](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/justin-trudeau-billed-taxpayers-1000-for-drink-box-water-bottle-sorta-things) for boxed water for his family.\n\nCarney had a similar \"gaffe\" where he was asked how much he thinks a week's of groceries cost and he just would not even entertain the \"fun\" question because he legitimately admits, he doesn't buy groceries.\n\nTrudeau going out buying things is a photo op.  No one found him at Canadian Tire.  He was there with a photographer to help rebuild his public image as regular joe guy.  The guy is rich, he doesn't buy groceries.  After leaving the Prime Ministership he immediately returned as chair of the PE Trudeau Foundation and has been returned access to his trust fund.

To have otherwise would make it so people like him benefit from being able to claim they will save the tax payers money because they won't be taking a salary or security details. \n\nFor example: we had a mayoral race here in Toronto about a decade ago which was between 2 wealthy men and a woman that was not poor but needed the salary to maintain a good QOL. Someone actually tried to make it a talking point and asked the candidates if they would donate their salary back to the city. Something only 2 of them could afford to do. To their credit, the 2 wealthy men refused to answer the question citing that it was an unfair question for the 3rd candidate allowing her to also sidestep it. (Spoiler, one of the wealthy men won and was mayor for 9 years and was succeeded by the woman who is our current mayor).\n\nAlso a tidbit: Reddit hated the old mayor but he was quite popular off reddit. Reddit also loves the current mayor and she is very polarizing off Reddit with an okay popularity rating).",

I'd guess that the vast majority of the F Trudeau crowd wouldn't do anything even if he was face-to-face with them, maybe just yell or something.  Of course, you worry and plan for the really violent nuts, but I'd guess that the majority of the time he can wander around freely going to Costco, filling up at Esso, and going to Cineplex.  \n\nAs for dating, it's not like Canada is full of super secret state secrets nor will Trudeau remain that influential now that he's out of politics.  I don't really see him as the kind of guy to make people kiss the ring now that he's out.  The party is going to quickly move on without him I guess and I'd imagine if Freeland stays in she'll want to ensure there's some distance.  So what I'm saying is even if there's a FSB honeypot plan, what's the point?  I mean, does he even get security briefings anymore?  \n\nI think if Trudeau grew a full beard, let his hair go grey, and kept to himself people could literally pass by him and not be any the wiser.  He'll just blend in like everybody else.  I suspect the most that most of us will see of him going forward is the occasional Hello! Canada magazine shot with him and his kids (or \"are Justin and Sophie back together?\").  And to be honest, he deserves to fade away gracefully.  The man has earned a break.",
