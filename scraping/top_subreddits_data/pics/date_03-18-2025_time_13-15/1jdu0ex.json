She does not have insurance, and got to the point where she could not even keep water down for hours at a time while dry heaving (and diarrhea), much less Pedialyte or Gatorade.  She lived in the bathroom for days with me being there 24/7 for whatever she might need. Watermelon had helped hydrate her after a heat stroke in the summer, and I found a small one for her recently, but it did not stay down. I found watermelon powder on Amazon (purchased beet powder a while back, which triggered the thought) and it was available within a day for us. When it arrived, I mixed a heaping tablespoon in Pedialyte, shaking it vigorously, and she drank it as a last resort before the ER. It did not come back up and she recovered quickly.\n\nShe was reinfected a few weeks later and it worked in being the only thing that stayed down when nothing else would, drastically reducing the infection time.\n\nShe is still exhausted from all of it, but drinks it daily, and I am grateful that it exists and that she is doing better.",

            "body": "Story time.  Back in 2005, I was a huge tracy morgan fan. Loved his SNL sketches, crank yankers, and even in living color.\n\n\nHe was doing a stand up set in SF and filming a CD at the same time.  I get ticket and have my buddies come with.  On the drive over, they started drink a whole bottle of hennesey and smoking hash in time for the set. \n\nWhen we arrived, we managed to secure a set next to tracy morgan.  He had a bucket of coronas on his table, and some chick's  hanging out whole another comedian was the opening act.\n\nI managed to say hello to tracy, tell him I'm a big fan, and looking forward to his show.  Meanwhile, my buddies are wasted off the hennesey and hash. One in particular, Ariel, was hanging his head of the table trying to keep himself together. \n\nWell the next thing I know, Ariel yaks all over  the side of the table and onto Tracy Morgan's shoes. Tracy jumps and yells in horror and tells security to get us out of there. There's a confrontation with security, a fit is about to break out, and I'm now focused on getting our money back from  the cashier before she figures out what's going on. It was a memorable evening. \n\nSpoony love! It's all good you yakked and had to be removed, it happens to all of us!",
