                    "body": "It's..... a lot of marketing stuff by most stores.\n\nFor example, BC and Alberta (9.5 million people) slaughter about 500,000 hogs a year.  For comparison sakes there are one million hogs slaughtered in Sask/Manitoba (population 2.5M people).  There isn't enough hog slaughtering capacity in BC/Alberta in the region for the 1.5 million hogs in Alberta and 300K hogs in BC.\n\nSo where do the hogs go?  Well not Saskatchewan they have 2.4 million hogs and Manitoba has 8.6 million hogs.  Okay, so just for western Canada we now have 11.3 million hogs that have no domestic slaughter plant.\n\nWell, they go to the US.  And even if they're being slaughtered in Canada they'll still likely go to a US feed lot to get fattened up.  Those pigs will be sold back to Canadian slaughterplants.  The rest will go to American slaugter plants.\n\nBut we consume more pork in Western Canada then our slaughterplant capacity.  So we actually import most of our pork from the US.  That pork will go to a maple leaf plant where they'll cut it into bacon, hotdogs, sausages, and other pork products.  Then stamp \"Made in Canada\" on it.  Or it will go directly to a grocery store where a butcher will cut it up into cuts and stamp \"Made in Canada\" on it.\n\nThere's no real separation between the pig that comes from America and Canada.  Which is why the Obama  \"Made in America\" rules never made sense either.\n\nI think saying something is \"Made in Canada\" in terms of food will only ever mislead.  Our food industry is so dependent on the US that a 5 day ban on products from Smithfields resulted in an immediate 8% bump in pork prices.",
