Per the IG source:\n\n> Push come to shove, these guys have a nasty bite. Even in the face of death, this Zebra didn't go down without a \"bight\". But the waters is the crocs domain, a good bite followed by death roll is their strategy.\n\n> JULY 22, 2022\n\n[Here](https://angama.com/blog-posts/this-week-at-angama/this-week-at-angama-232/) (has many more pictures and the full story):\n\n> The zebra hadn't made a hasty enough dash to the other bank and another croc seized the opportunity. Grabbing the hind leg, the croc began to spiral rendering the zebra completely immobile. Improbably, the zebra still had some fight left \u2014 in one of the most jaw-dropping scenes I have witnessed, we watched as this doomed zebra managed to give its attacker a nasty bite back. It was an incredible display of inherent survival instincts.",

I\u2019ve rescued fully papered thoroughbreds to BLM mustangs and asses, and in between there a few exotics like zebras.\n\nNormally an abused equine like most prey animals are skittish after being abused by humans and revert back to a \u201cI\u2019ll stay over here you stay over there in my line of sight\u201d mentality and will match you move for move to keep you in that position\u2026.. Zebras are like the \u201cfuq dis YOLO!\u201d members of the family. Even being emaciated and visibly sick they will charge, chase, bite, kick, stomp on you or anything that remotely smells like you. They will go down with the ship and do it swinging the largest bat possible.\n\nThe first zebra rescue I remember required tranquilizers and two vets (one had to stay in the trailer to keep it down during the long transport so it didn\u2019t wake up and beat itself or the trailer to death upon coming to). The easiest was actually a voluntary release where the licensed owner gave the animal up because they were too sick to care for it an other animals. This one could be approached without too many issues, but if you got close it was biting the shit out of you or if you were close and turned your back to it then it might bite you or try to charge you.\n\nSo yeah\u2026.. screw zebras\u2026 they can stay over there, and I\u2019ll stay right here where I can keep my eyes on them\u2026 ;)",
