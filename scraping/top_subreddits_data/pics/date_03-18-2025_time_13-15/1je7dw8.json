The right is so deep on their knees, gargling Trump and Elon\u2019s balls, and waiting patiently for the moneyshot and to be told that they did a good job, that they can\u2019t even see that they\u2019re supporting fascism and destroying America.\n\nHere\u2019s some constitutional violations we\u2019ve had so far, in case you\u2019ve got something in your eye and missed it.\n\nTrump is against birthright citizenship, which is 14th Amendment. Mahmoud Khalil was arrested for free speech, which is 1st Amendment. Trump has threatened the government into granting him Congress\u2019 power of the purse, which is Article 1, Section 1, as well as the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. Congress should have immediately began invoking the 25th Amendment the second Trump said \u201cannex Canada\u201d, but they didn\u2019t. Trump continuing to run Trump businesses in office is a violation of Article 1, Section 9 (the emoluments clause). \n\nDOGE and Elon are wiping their asses with the Constitution and laws too. Article 1, Section 1 (separation of powers); Article 1, Section 7 (presentment and appropriations clause); Article 1, Section 8 (spending clause); Article 2, Section 3 (take care clause); the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the Anti-Deficiency Act, the Privacy Act of 1974, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, the E-Government Act of 2002, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Administrative Leave Act of 2016.\n\nThis leaves out multiple federal ethics violations for both, such as Trump promoting Goya products from the Oval Office, and Trump and Musk promoting Tesla on the White House lawn, especially considering that Musk would obtain private wealth for that, and Musk continues to donate said private wealth to Trump.\n\nIf you think these are inconsequential issues for Trump, but Biden pardoning his son was a huge overreach of power, then you\u2019re part of the problem. You have accepted that Trump is stronger than Congress, stronger than the judiciary, stronger than the Constitution, and above everything that we as Americans hold dear.\n\nIn short, by denying any necessary accountability from Trump, you make the case that Trump is more important to you than your allegiance to your country and your Constitution. You\u2019re not an American. You\u2019re a traitor.\n\nSo allow me to flip that question on you:\n\n**What the actual fuck is wrong with the right?**",
