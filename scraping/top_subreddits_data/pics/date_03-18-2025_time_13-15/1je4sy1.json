I myself am a russian, born there, raised there, and immigrated to Germany alone at the age of 15 in 2018. From the beginning of the war it was really hard for me to accept the fact of genocide, executed on behalf of the russian military leaders, by the hands of my previous \"compatriots\". The thing is, meanwhile for almost everybody it would be just some random canon meat or orcs (who did that) for almost everybody else, for me it could be my school comrades, exactly in the conscription age at that point. So I refused to accept this genocide, just because even the thought about that the people you spent your time with, when I was younger, could now be participants of military crimes was absolutely unbearable. But now we are here, at that point, when we have absolutely clear facts, pictures and videos of civilians tortured, killed and then disposed like trash. That was the day I felt the hatred against the fact of which country I was born in, against my previous compatriots and the day, on which something deeply inside of me was irreparably broken.",

Ever since Russian forces downed MH17 (and I know I should've been more aware of what was going on preceding this point as well as in Georgia, I'm sorry), I knew Russia needed to pay. \n\nI watched so closely and saw so much horrendous footage of Russia's invasion. Executed civilians with their eyes shot out; journalists under fire just driving down a road; seniors mowed down in their car from a 30mm BTR. Lots of terrible stuff that this tree hugging bleeding heart liberal doesn't normally seek out but felt compelled to bear witness to the horrors Putin has been inflicting upon (I also can't say this without seeing the parallels of a fellow internationally charged war criminal in Israel) innocent civilians in a sovereign nation. No different than when Hitler invaded Poland.\n\nAnd some claim as Chamberlain that we should appease the tyrant with a gift of territory?

That Trump practically kisses the ring of Putin while giving a modern day Churchill defending his people and his land hell is despicable.",

The inclusion of the former Soviet countries in NATO makes this harder.\n\nThe proof of this is that Ukraine is not the first country bordering Russia that Putin has invaded with territory annexed into Russia. The Russo-Georgian War that started in 2008 involved Russia illegally taking Russian territory and ethnic cleansing of Georgians by Russians. Sounds familiar, right?  \n\nKnow who has a much smaller military relative to Russia but *hasn\u2019t* been invaded? NATO members like Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. And when Finland joined NATO, Putin moved troops to the border to guard against any NATO aggression, right? Oh, wait, no he didn\u2019t. He actually moved troops and equipment *away* from the border leaving it with minimal border police, with regular troops and equipment deployed to the Ukrainian theater.",

In the end, a statement was read into the negotiation record that the (according to the U.S. lawyers) lesser sense of the English word \"assurance\" would be the sole implied translation for all appearances of both terms in all three language versions of the statement.[17] In the Ukrainian version of the document, the wording \"security guarantees\" was used though*\n\nAs much as I hate the current admin, the US did not fail to uphold their part of the budapest memorandum in any way.\n\nThe assistance given to ukraine thus far is far beyond what the treaty required.",

One short school year later and I saw 3000 people die on live TV in the classroom and being told \u201cclass I want you to watch this because this is a historical event. This will be in history books\u201d. Then followed 20 years of war and childrens deaths and school shootings becoming popular and yeah it\u2019s just been all downhill since then. \n\nRepublicans got mad that Clinton cheated on his wife with his secretary, came on her tiddies, and then lied about it and had to pretend to stand on morals only to get their brains broken by a black man getting elected and do a complete 180 to accept our current president as lord and savior. \n\nCrazy times we\u2019ve been living in.",

Trump basically killed NATO, and that is going to gravely hurt the USA.  But a coalition of the willing will rise to help defend Ukraine. The US will not be a part of that.

Do people here seriously not get that Z is gradually trying to build something like a dictatorship in our country? I\u2019m not a fan of Trump, but his phrase \u201cZelensky is a dictator without elections\u201d wasn\u2019t just a joke, it wasn\u2019t that far from the truth. Ever heard of \u201cbusification\u201d in Ukraine? No? Maybe you\u2019ve heard about the heat on the opposition or the media that dare to criticize Saint Ze? Maybe you\u2019ve heard about the next-level corruption going down during the war? Maybe you\u2019ve heard about Yermak and his pull? You haven\u2019t heard shit. It\u2019s ok because you\u2019re all eating up the propaganda bullshit that \u201cproper media\u201d feeds you about Ukraine, skipping the uncomfortable stuff. I also  read \u201cindependent\u201d media (which in Ukraine were funded by USAID) and they also avoid covering many things, mostly because they fear pressure from the Zelenskyy\u2019s administration. Mostly 40+ women, dumbasses, pensioners, and the ones cashing in on the war right now still back him. His ratings are not good, it\u2019s mostly lies. \nBtw that pic (where he\u2019s all dramatic and cinematic-looking sad)? They snapped when he just sniffed real quick, but it turned into the perfect propaganda shot\n\nhttps://youtu.be/N2APCERKAqo?si=nzrvoSevqC30zEVk\n\nUPD: I\u2019d rather be bothered by your downvotes than your cluelessness. As a ukrainian, seeing this support for Zelenskyy is honestly just freaking hilarious and kind of scary??? Zelenskyy \u2260 Ukraine. I get that it\u2019s tough to believe all this, but staying in denial is worse, it\u2019s even risky.
