People can deny it as much as they want but people don't vote in the politicians that do the most things but rather the ones that they THINK are doing the most things.\n\nIt doesn't matter that Biden passed the infrastructure act rather that the people know that he signed it and what it does. The act itself does not generate votes but this sign does. Meaning plenty of politicians skip the bill part and go directly to the sign. And when those politicians win that means voters are reinforcing that behavior. Being politician is 80% PR at least.\n\nHeck, Biden signed the infrastructure and jobs act, a bill good enough for Republicans to take credit from it, and his party lost the election. The reason that people say they lost? It can be summed up with: bad PR.",
