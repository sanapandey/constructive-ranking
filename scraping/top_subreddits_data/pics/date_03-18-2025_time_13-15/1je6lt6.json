                            "body": "I think the problem that tends to happen, like in periods like the 2010's... is a complacency. \n\n\"We won! Now let's enjoy life.\" Meanwhile, those who lost aren't enjoying... they are scheming and devising ways to come back. The Republican Party has been on a crusade since the horrible Bush years followed by two terms of a black Democrat president. They used racism to rile up a large sector of people. Trump didn't create this. He simply harnessed what was already there. HE WAS ENCOURAGED by the far-right to step up. Steve Bannon in particular. \"The time is now. Step up and it could all be yours.\" And with so much foreign help pouring in with disinformation propaganda peppering vulnerable social media, it happened.\n\nWhen we kicked Trump to the dirt in 2020, it wasn't over. Did any Democrats reach across the aisle to proactively put together a bipartisan rebuilding plan? No. MAGA was reviled. The GOP was laughed at. And so McCarthy went crawling back to Trump at Mar-a-Lago and begged him to stay involved.\n\nI can't hammer this down enough--Donald Trump was the worst possible candidate one could pick. He was not only a convicted felon on fraud for over 30 counts awarded unanimously (fraud, meaning a liar, a deceiver), he had 3 other major indictments with court cases in the queue. He was in really deep shit and he even admitted that he had to win the election to avoid prison. Same for Elon Musk, admitted to Tucker Carlson that if Trump doesn't win he's in deep shit (no wonder why he pumped $250 million into Trump's campaign for swing states).  THE GLARING PROBLEM WAS STARING US IN OUR FACES... but news media really failed us. They treated Trump as just \"the other candidate.\" Rarely did they bring up his unbelievable baggage. And of course the far-right only brought it up when asked, dispelling it as all a \"political hit job with no merit.\" \n\nThe litmus test was conducted and America failed. I mean, even if you discount the sweeping election suppression acts by the Republicans, Trump got way too many votes for comfort. It proved that right-wing media was supremely effective and perpetuating false positive narratives about Trump and false negatives about Harris.",

                                    "body": "> We won! Now let's enjoy life.\"\n\nI saw the opposite.\n\nI saw a broad tolerance of gay marraige, a broad concensus that racial profiling was bad and that cops were over-doing their mandate.\n\nBut what followed was \"white people need to sit down and shut up\" messaging and \"equality is racist\" messaging.\n\nI was a gay-rights activist in the 90s.  I was ousted from the very groups in the late 2010s because while I support rights of trans people and other things, I was never in full approval of the \"it's all the same\" arguments of turning the well accepted rainbow flag into a \"tolerance for everything\" bucket.  They added trans and even racial equlaity to the flag.  Everyone rolled their eyes and decided the message was too stretched. \n\nWhat we spoke about in the late 1990s and early 2000s was \"gay people are just normal people\".  that resonated.  Matthew Shepard was killed, and the message was \"he was just a kid who was as confused as any other and he was killed for it\" (yes I'm aware there are people who are skeptical of his character).\n\nWhen Will and Grace had a gay character, he was just another random \"TV dad\" type.  When \"queer as folk\" premiered, it was just a show about some normal friends who lived fairly ordinary urban lifestyles.\n\nBut after that came the push.  And it was rapid and HARD.  It started in earnest about 2014-2015 and it was pretty obvious from my view.\n\nThe range of impacts it had were broad, but I'll pick out a few...\n\nFor example, trying to put drag queens and trans people in the same bucket as \"vanilla\" gay couples. \n\nAggressively lecturing white people about their \"privilege\" even when they were \"under-priviliged\" in a different way.  \n\nDemanding quotas on everything from university admissions to hiring to government business procurement.\n\n(In Canada) Pushing indigenous topics to the forefront of nearly every political conversation.\n\nA HUGE push on diversity from every area of government, education, industry, etc. BLM became and official motto of NBA teams and iconography of racial protest groups was officially put on the logo sets of professional stadiums, etc. \n\n**That's not \"complacency\" and \"sitting back doing nothing\".  What I saw was actually a sense of \"We won and can now do whatever we want and anyone who protests is ok to just cancel.  Get them fired, they're Nazis.\"**\n\nI had a friend in Ontario Canada who is a liberal voter, far from a conservative who simply asked a question during a DEI training. The training was mandating that they have a \"diversity panel\" that was mandatory attendance for all teachers.  But only minorities and a selected few hand-chosen \"advocates\" were allowed to speak.  Everyone else was required to sit and listen.\n\nHe simply said \"I don't think it's useful to mandate in advance that only certain racial demographics are allowed to speak regarding policy that affects everyone.\"\n\nHe was kicked out of the seminar and then later that week his contract was terminated.\n\nAbsolutely wild behaviour.\n\nYes, this was in Canada, but I know of at least a couple similar stories in Boston and California and similar discussions across the \"more blue\" parts of the US.\n\nIf progressives had said \"we had a good run, let's sit back for a bit\" in circa 2015, I kind of doubt all of this push-back would have taken place.\n\nBut the reality is that this hurt all the efforts.\n\nSelf-repoted \"race relations\" by racialized groups hit a self-reported (via surveys) high in 2014.  that was the best it ever got.  It was only after these divisive messages started hitting the mainstream that these people started to report \"race relations are getting worse\".\n\nSelf-reported tolerance for gay people hit an all-time high in 2017.  Again, further pushing and further advocacy with increasingly polarizing messages (i.e. drag queens reading to kids) got away from the \"gay people can look just like you and I and data shows us they make fine parents\" into \"you have to accept everyone even if they're super strange looking and behave oddly according to normal social standards\".\n\nBut that push to fundamentally deconstruct social norms really wasn't that prevalent until there were less \"fundamental\" topics to focus on, in my opinion.\n\nGod this turned into an essay, sorry.  I'll stop ranting now.",

I'm frustrated with the helplessly defeatist attitude I see a lot of people have nowadays, I feel like it does more harm to the resistance than the opposition ever could. I see people who won't do anything to help the current situation, which is fine that's its own issue. I can't expect everyone to take up the banner. But then I see those same people criticize or downplay and generally undermine any action they see being taken.\n\nI see people glorify the strength of the enemy and cry about the weakness of us and our allies. They say the revolution could never happen when our oppressors are just too strong, too smart, too powerful. Why try? No one will try, and no one should! Defeat is inevitable, we should just try to hide and hope the oppressors don't pay us too much mind. This kind of thinking is sabotage!\n\nSo we bring up history, we talk about successful revolutions and the tactics that have been shown to work and all that they say is \"a revolution could never work *today.* Maybe those past revolutions got lucky, but our oppressors are different! No enemy has ever been as great as the enemy we face!\" Some people are so stubborn in their doubt that I feel like I have to applaud the FBI for running such a successful psy-op.\n\nThis is the attitude I wanted to convey with my earlier comment. Not infighting, I'd never mean to contribute to that problem. If u/MetalBeardKing had only said \"I'd love to see this happen!\" and focused on their support for our allies in Hungary as opposed to it seems already planning their funeral, I likely wouldn't have said anything. If they had even said \"I'd love to see this happen, but I worry it won't happen\" I wouldn't have been nearly as angry!\n\nBut it was the fact that they simply said \"It WON'T happen.\" and their using the word *attempted* that made me so frustrated. Who are you to decide what will or won't happen? Who are you to declare a revolution futile, or resistance as vain? \n\nPlease note, this isn't to say we're better off without the nay-sayers, we're only better off without the nay-saying. We don't gatekeep the revolution, all comrades are welcome. But PLEASE for the love of all that is holy if you're going to a be a comrade that whines and complains and all but sucks up to the enemy, consider at least being a comrade that is quiet.\n\n=========\n\nTL;DR, Put Up or Shut Up.",

Mussolini popularized fascism before the internet\u2026 even before most people had telephones. Societies tend to experience cycles that tend towards right wing extremism over time, because dumb and scared people are easy to push in that direction. It\u2019s always easier to push fear and outrage than tolerance and empathy, especially in times of social or economic turmoil. People who are trying to consolidate power for themselves always use this as a way to do so, and so their followers and society in general often trends that way until the inevitable collapse of the power structure, or eventual loss of public support. Whether by military coup or peoples revolution, or whatever, usually these types of conditions come to a end when people get fed up with being poor and oppressed, or blatant corruption leads to collapse of industry and government.\n\nFrom ashes, many times the rebuild is in a more progressive image that is meant to lift up all citizens (intent and reality often diverge, but a basic structure of ideals is usually more liberal following collapse of right-wing regimes). Just as often it\u2019s rebuilt by another dictator\u2026 but eventually societies tend to swing back the other way. And things are good for a time\u2026 and when things are too good for too long, societal consciousness forgets what it means to have to fight to preserve their liberties and quality of life, and get tricked into right-wing ideas. The French have seen this shit enough over the centuries that their collective memory is strong and they know what it takes to maintain freedom for the working class. But many cultures do not.",

So you cannot harass someone by following them around and yelling at them all day. You also cannot go around committing slander against someone either. At least not in public. You could always say this stuff to yourself or express it at home privately and never get in trouble. It really follows the idea that your rights end where another person's rights begin. Because if everything is allowed then the worst of humanity is allowed as well, so there has to be limits.",

Of course not, you are from a bot farm in Russia or whatever.\n\nNow even if I take your point seriously (which is very hard to do)... Wow. A literal law that forbids certain types of protests based of declaring it's content \"indecent\" is not an attack on free speach?\n\nMay I remind you, in Hungary, homosexuality in itself is declared indecent. That's the excuse they are using for banning it. The Hungarian Child Protection Law forbids the distribution of any material to minors that portrays homosexuality, deviations from gender roles based on birth sex, or the idea that gender can be changed. What this new law does to ban pride marches is basically applying this part of the \"Child Protection Law\" to the\u00a0laws on the Right to Assembly and Misdemeanors.\n\nLet me repeat that last point: That the mere act of homosexuality is indecent and after this new law now are also excempt from right to assembly laws. How is this not a restriction on free speach you idiot?. Just waiving a pride flag in public is literally ilegal there with this law.\n\nThere is also the fact that they also changed the laws regarding the Right to Assembly to allow the police to disperse any event if it deviates from the terms of its police authorization in any way, shape or form. Which is another different restriction of free speach.\n\nAnd if you are a lesbian then there is proof that gay people can be fucking awful and ignorant too. In Hungary, gay marriages are ilegal and the mere act of displaying \"homosexual acts\" in publics can be prosecuted and fined. Why are you defending that? \n\nAnd this is also an issue from an equality sense. Making a heterosexual march where everyone screams how proud they are of their heterosexual marriages is 100% legal there still. Doing the same if you are gay? Compleatly not the case. Doesn't that, as a \"lesbian woman of color\" bother you?\n\nAlso, I'm not from Hungary but I have all the rights to have an opinion about the laws they are passing, specially when those laws are being used as an example for laws on other places that do hit closer to home. And I did bring the facts, if anything I said is indeed wrong please say exactly what. Still waiting for that cake recepie too.",
