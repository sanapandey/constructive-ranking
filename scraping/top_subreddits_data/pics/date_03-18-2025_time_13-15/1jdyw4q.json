I'll go take pics of several of these houses that are still covered in (slightly different) Trump shit just to prove that I saw this same flag flying all over here before the election.

It would seem from your recent post history that you are not a Trump/Elon supporter, and are in fact opposed to the orange madness, however also seem to like to be contradictory and wind people up over small details. I.e. internet troll or basement dweller. \n\nAre you saying that they did not sell that flag with Biden on it? Cause they did. For sure. And I saw a bunch of them. SO my point stands, that if \"I were to fly this new one now, people around ME would probably not notice it was TRUMP on it\" because they all already saw it with BIDEN on it before. That was my point. In case you missed it.\n\nWhatever dude, I have to live surrounded my MAGA bullshit, I don't need it from you too.",
