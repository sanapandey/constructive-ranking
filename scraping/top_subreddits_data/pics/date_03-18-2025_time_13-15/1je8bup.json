[Here](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/01/harrowing-new-images-from-the-capitol-riot) provides the following caption:\n\n> Dominic Pezzola, a member of the Proud Boys, smashes a window of the Capitol building with a US Capitol Hill Police riot shield, allowing other rioters to enter. On January 6th, during the insurrection, supporters of Donald Trump attempted to overturn the certification of votes from the presidential election in Washington DC. Pezzola was later charged with conspiracy and assault. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly described Pezzola as \"the tip of a spear that pierced the United States Capitol.\n\n> Photograph by Christopher Lee/TIME. \n\n[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Pezzola) adds:\n\n> Pezzola admitted that he was wearing a hat on which was written \"Respect is earned, beatings are free\" during the riot. He also admitted that he lied to the FBI regarding whether one of his co-defendants had a firearm during the riot. He called the trial \"phony\" and \"corrupt,\" arguing that he was speaking metaphorically when he said he was willing to fight for the Proud Boys, comparing his past remarks to \"how I'm fighting this corrupt trial with these fake charges.\"...\n\n> On September 1, 2023, Pezzola was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison and three years supervised release, less than half of the 20 years that prosecutors had sought. In his tearful plea for leniency to the court, Pezzola said he had given up politics, telling the judge, \"Your honor, I stand before you as a changed and humbled man.\" However, minutes after his sentence was handed down, and U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly had left the courtroom, Pezzola, as he was being escorted out of the courtroom by U.S. Marshals, reversed his earlier stated positions of having given up politics and of having been deceived by Trump. Raising his fist and with a smile, shouted, \"Trump won!\", repeating Trump's unfounded claim of election fraud, which had led to the Capitol riot...\n\n> On January 20, 2025, after beginning his second term in office, President Trump commuted Pezzola's sentence.",

He served time in jail and prison.  I'm not sure how long, but my guess is months.   Commuting his sentence to match case precedent established by other cases is not wrong. No one, regardless of political affiliation should have their sentences be biased by their political affiliation.  This is necessary to protect Democrats from a Republican majority, and vice versa.  In many of the Jan 6 cases, defendants with no prior criminal history who only trespassed were receiving unusually severe sentences which, juxtaposed against violent defendants with long rap sheets getting hardly no time at all, raised legitimate concerns that the DOJ was persecuting conservatives.",
