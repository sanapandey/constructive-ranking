                    "body": "Yes. I was there, 50m away and to the side so I wasn't in the beam's path. 3.000 people affected. \n\nCould have been hundreds trampled. Animals.\n\n\nEdit: Copying my comment here, if anyone is interested in the depths of cruel depravity Serbian government goes to \n\nIt was 15 minutes of silence for the victims so you could hear a pin drop. Suddenly there was a whooshing sound, not extremely loud but strange, like a lot of people murmuring loudly at the same time. \n\nThen immediately stampede started like crazy. Luckily it stopped in a couple of seconds. We were sure a car plowed into the crowd, but then went to check and there was nothing and everyone was confused. Some people on the floor, some having panic attacks. \n\nBased on what people who were in the middle of the street said, it was likely a microwave area denial system, although there was some eardrum damage so I am not 100% sure.\n\nIt was a narrow beam for sure, since us who have been standing on the sidewalk, just 5-6 meters from the center of the street felt nothing, but those in the street had severe symptoms and a lot were treated.\n\n\nNow, this is interesting - the 15 minutes of silence was supposed to start at 6:52, but it started at 7:00. The attack seems to have been planned for immediately after this, when there would be a lot of noise and agitation and the sound and source would not be easily discernable in the recordings.\n\n This way, since it was completely silent, it was clear what happened and the stampede stopped after a couple of seconds. Otherwise, there could have been dozens or hundreds people trampled and they would have blamed the 'unruly mob' on starting the tragedy.\n\nThis was attempted (mass) murder under false flag pretense, make no mistake about it. \n\nAt the same time, they launched a coordinated attack by the thugs and criminals holed up behind a fence in a nearby park, but since the silence hasn't finished and people haven't flooded there in large numbers yet, student organizers were able to react immediately and give a signal to vacate the area immediately. So the thugs suddenly remained all alone in the square and then retreated back.\n\nHad they timed the coordinated attack to start 8 minutes later, there would be pools of innocent blood on the street. They would them unleash the turtles (heavily shieleded gendarmes) and probably declare martial law, flooding the media with the narrative that protesters started the violence.\n\n\nPlus now the prosecutor's office has publicly stated that they will prosecute anyone who claims this for inciting public panic, so I could be arrested for this post. People with severe medical consequences, people who had heart attacks could be arrested and prosecuted for saying what happened to them.\n\n\n\nIf there are any journalists interested, and want to bring this to global attention,  there are many more details behind that I cannot share here.",

I think they even used it during the George Floyd protests but on a much smaller scale and not injunction with a planned attack. Next major protests will 100% have this used on them Tho if Trump doesn't go straight to firing on the protesters like it's the new York draft riots which wouldn't supprise me. I said this somewhere else but if you live in the USA and have either duel citizenship (or are eligible for citizenship somewhere else) or have the money too should leave coz shit is only going to get worse before the possibility of it getting better there.",

I am now almost certain it was something like this: [https://youtu.be/bMoCqrFKqdA](https://youtu.be/bMoCqrFKqdA) \\- basically some kind of \"vortex cannon\" like you will have seen Mark Rober and others making on YouTube, except this is way more powerful, is (supposedly) intended for scaring birds, but there could well be a \"crowd-control version\" as well.\n\nIt produces EXACTLY the effect we saw on Saturday, especially on a crowd of people standing still. It's actually uncanny. You can watch Backyard Scientist demonstrate a REALLY big one as well, though this device wouldn't have needed to be this powerful I don't think: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSm7Tp8iv3o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSm7Tp8iv3o) \\- check the sound it makes, the distance the pulse can travel and the way it physically whips the branches of a tree at like 1000 ft. This could've been fired OVER the heads of the crowd so it could travel a long way and affect that many people.\n\nSome NGOs are also now suggesting this type of device may have been used, the government of course denies it, but if this is basically a bird-scaring device they can plausibly deny it's a weapon. Maybe they borrowed it off the same farmers they \"borrowed\" all those tractors from...\n\n  \nEdit: see this quote from an agricultural site: [https://flockfree.com/blogs/flock-free-articles/crows-damaging-a-pistachio-orchard-vortex-ring-accelerator-bird-defense-trial](https://flockfree.com/blogs/flock-free-articles/crows-damaging-a-pistachio-orchard-vortex-ring-accelerator-bird-defense-trial)\n\n*The first week of September we began initial trials on Vortex Ring Accelerator (VRAD) technologies, on a 300 acre pistachio orchard near Bakersfield, California.\u00a0 The terrain at this location is quite hilly so visibility issues were somewhat limited. We were primarily tasked with keeping infesting flocks of crows from damaging the\u00a0pistachio\u00a0crop.*\n\n*As you can see from the following photos, the VRAD is not a canon. It is something far more impressive and effective. The Vortex Ring Generator actually* ***produces a Vortex Ring that acts as a projectile traveling through the air****. In addition to a* ***fierce concussion****, an intense \u201cbang\u201d and a* ***shock wave****,* ***the vortex ring travels through the air ringing and screaming*** *past the point where humans can hear it. A vortex is formed when fluid (the fluid in our case being air) flows back on itself, making a spinning ring around an invisible core. The vortex ring produces little resistance as it moves through the air allowing it to* ***travel long distances****.* ***The Vortex Ring acts as a projectile*** *and may actually hit birds (without harming them)* ***adding to the fear level.***",

Everyone who is there is there because they are furious at the government for the deaths of these innocents and absolutely determined to remember their deaths and remind the government that we blame them and their cronies and they're NOT getting away with it. But yeah, it's beyond impressive, and it's not a minute's silence, it's FIFTEEN minutes, it's incredible.\n\nWe do it in our cities, too, every Friday at 11.52 we block all the major intersections, people just step out in the road when the pedestrian light turns green, with no prearranged signal, people just seem to pop up from nowhere and we stay there, all the drivers stop and turn off their engines and there's complete silence for 15 minutes and almost (barring a very few incidents) no-one complains or tries to get through.",

I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding or maybe there is a small language barrier issue here. Typically a false flag is when one group does something with the intention of blaming another group. A famous example would be the Russian government bombing apartment buildings and blaming Chechens to justify waging war on them. Is there some element like that which has happened? Is the government blaming that action on another group?",

He has family where everyone was locked in their house snd burned alive. During Yugoslav times they weren\u2019t allowed to learn Albanian in their schools. The Serbian government still refuses to acknowledge Kosovo (and thats not what they are protesting, if they have a change in power the new guy will likely still not recognise Kosovo). The media their does not talk about then kindly. Also notably there were not massive protests during these genocides. Even when my husband saw this protest his first thought was \u201cevery time Serbians protest against the government they start some sh*t in Kosovo to distract them\u201d. Keep in mind these were in the 90s, the people who participated in these genocides are very much alive.\n\nAdditionally there is a massive Roma population throughout the Balkans, who has lived there for centuries, they are not treated kindly by the media or by the general population.",

I think people anywhere run the risk of losing their job if they don't show up to it. Healthcare? Not so much. Generally speaking healthcare is not tied to having a job. If you're employed your health insurance is just deducted from your paycheck automatically. If you're not, you gotta fork out for it yourself, but the amount tends to be about the same and not anywhere close to the astronomical prices seen in the US.\n\nAs far as voting, I don't know of a country in Europe that doesn't have elections on a weekend.

What are the Serbs in this photo protesting about?  Everybody here seems to know except me.  Is it human rights?  Government oppression?  Lack of food?  It is lack of food isn't it?\n\nThere is this odd assumption like I'm supposed to go out and join a protest and march on my local capital holding a sign, but I'm totally clueless what the \"cause\" is I'm supposed to protest.  What sign do I hold?  I fully get other people in other countries NEED to protest, their lives are clearly unimaginably difficult and they are dying in the streets (of things like starvation).  But what is somebody like me in the USA supposed to protest?  Having too much food?  Or are my 3D video games are too awesome now?  My internet is too fast?  How is the establishment failing me?  I live in the USA, my life is easy.  It isn't like my children will go hungry, the last person that died of starvation in the USA was in the 1920s (more than 100 years ago).  It's not right or just, and it sucks 1 million children in India starved last year (in a 12 month period, we are literally talking about 5 year old children here), and they NEED to protest that, but what am I supposed to protest in the USA?\n\nThere is this super old movie with an actor that has been dead for over 70 years where he wanted to rebel against something in the USA, but he didn't actually have any \"cause\".  It was called \"Rebel without a Cause\" or something like that.  It is a movie about confused suburban middle-class teenagers and their pointless angst.  There is a famous line in it where they ask the star of the film, \"What are you rebelling against?\" but he doesn't have any answer at all (just angst, no actual answer).   Even back in 1955 in the USA when the film was made there wasn't anything to protest anymore if you live in the USA.  And back in 1955 they didn't even have internet.  Or video games.  For goodness sake, Hostess Ding Dongs were invented in 1967.  When they made the movie they didn't even have Ding Dongs.  But the main character still didn't have anything at all he could object to in his easy life.  Not even the lack of Ding Dongs.\n\nProtests make a heck of a lot more sense when there is hardship.",

They are doing a lot of awful shit\n\nI've never voted for Trump and never will.  I think he will go down in history as one of the worst presidents ever, twice.  But I do have mixed feelings on DOGE.\n\nWe have this problem in the USA that the government spends more money than it brings in through taxes.  It's a really significant problem, in that it is cursing future generations (our grand children) with an unmanageable set of payments.  While most of the spending has good intentions, the math says we cannot afford all of it.  Until DOGE, no politician was willing to even consider addressing the issue.\n\nDOGE is going about it in a strange way, but nobody else was trying to balance the budget.  I'm a little worried DOGE will give \"balancing the budget\" a bad name, where everybody assumes deficit spending is good because it is the opposite of DOGE.  Balancing the budget should be a bi-partisan issue, it should have support from all parties and all citizens.  What kind of monster wants their children to have unmanageable debt payments just so we can live beyond our means?",

He has family where everyone was locked in their house and burned alive. During Yugoslav times they weren\u2019t allowed to learn Albanian in their schools. The Serbian government still refuses to acknowledge Kosovo (and thats not what they are protesting, if they have a change in power the new guy will likely still not recognise Kosovo). The media their does not talk about then kindly. Also notably there were not massive protests during these genocides. Even when my husband saw this protest his first thought was \u201cevery time Serbians protest against the government they start some sh*t in Kosovo to distract them\u201d\n\nKeep in mind the people who participated in these genocide are very much still alive.",

If Trump and MAGA are the face of the Republican Party you don\u2019t get to distance yourself from that if you still say you are republican. That is the party now. Schoolmates also said he was conservative. Routh voted for Trump in 2016 before going off the rails and his narrative shows he went back and forth politically. These attempts are also not the equivalent of \u201canti-Trump protests\u201d. Let\u2019s be real here.",

I voted one midterm election in 2006 as Republican when I turned 18 and generally never again on any ballot except for one Republican Congressmen I knew personally. \n\nIs it crazy to think someone who is a registered Republican is Republican? No. Is it crazy to think someone who is a registered republican is MAGA? No, but you also should not make that assumption because I'm sure there's millions of people for whom it's not true. Is it crazy to think someone who tries to assassinate Donald Trump is a supporter of his? Yes, it is legitimately a crazy line of thought. \n\nAs for an assassination attempt not being a form of protest, I have to vehemently disagree with you there. Especially if the idea is a pissing contest of which group of people hates someone more. Until Serbians start trying to assassinate Vuvic I'll have to disagree that their forms of protest are more severe or impressive.",

There are alot of protest spread out but for us to collectively gather at one location , at the same time,day, and have everyone be able to sleep/ eat is a logistical challenge.\n\nThis is why us lacking opposition leadership is so frustrating. We need someone to figure out the logistics but also the person who pushes the logistic has to be someone everyone looks at as a leader, and trust them.\n\nLarge gatherings are easy when your nation is small like Serbia, it's 29,000 mi, but new york state alone is about 54,000 mi.\n\n\n\nWest Virginia is\t24,230 mi and it's our 41st smallest state.\n\nWe are protesting \nhttps://apnews.com/article/50501-protests-project-2025-trump-state-capitols-ddd341171a54ba9b498cbfe7530e18ab",

There is a huge campaign from Russian groups to make Americans feel hopeless and tired. The more people telling you that people in the US won't do it the less likely you are to do it. \n\nStatistically, it only takes 3.5% of the population showing up to peaceful protests to make meaningful change. So Go. Protest.\n\nYes the US is large, so joining larger protests is harder because people are more spread out. But that doesn't mean there aren't protests in your area.\n\nAnd even if there aren't protests, go to town halls. Policitics is super important at the lower levels, and changing local politics also helps change local opinions. If everyone in your neighborhood is supporting, for example, the LGBTQ plus movement, it's much easier for your local John Doe to come around to the idea that seeing it online all the time.\n\nAnd even if you can't go to the town hall meetings, boycott and strike. My god do these work well. Strikes are the reason we have weekends and holidays and PTO. Boycotts can tank companies. They work so well if enough people do it. So cut out Amazon, don't get Goya products, don't buy that new thing you were looking to get, buy local or directly from the manufacturer. Look at how well the Tesla boycotts are working?\n\nDon't sit here and feel helpless. Be the change you want to see!",

People in one faculty have different tasks and groups. The faculties within the University also discuss and coordinate between themselves. Each faculty also has social media to inform people what is happening. Each faculty helps with its expertise. All study programs are blocked from happening, everything is frozen.\n\nIT people (and IT students) also made some pretty cool websites. There is one that tracks what is needed by each faculty; stuff like food, water, medicine, blankets. There are some other websites that display where the protests are happening in the next period. There is a website to collect money for professors and teachers, since the government cut their salaries in retaliation.\n\nI don't know if you've heard about it, but Serbian students went by foot from city to city to spread the energy. First walk was Belgrade - Novi Sad (about 100 km), but later many more walks happened. Random people were preparing food for protest participants, bringing pots and cooking, bringing sweets and waters and all kinds of support.\n\nFinally, one small but consistent thing that started everything - people are meeting up in certain places everyday at the same time, and blocking the traffic for 15 minutes. 15 minutes of complete silence for 15 people who died when the train station canopy/roof fell. In the beginning, angry drivers tried to push through and hit many people over a month, but people were brave and strong and continued this. It is still going on in many places in Belgrade. On March 15 (this protest), all the people went silent for 11 minutes. At least half a million people completely silent. Sadly, the government attacked during that using some sort of sonic cannon, cutting the 15 minutes short.\n\nThese are some of the ways people have organized. It takes a lot of energy and bravery and strength, but it's fascinating what these people are achieving and how well organized everything is.",

No one has taken responsibility for it yet. \n\nSo we started organizing protests led by students who are refusing to continue their school year. The symbol of the protest has been a bloody hand. The government response was spray painting red middle fingers everywhere. Then during the 15 minutes of silence for 15 victims, they used a sonic weapon to cause panic and a stampede, further risking the lives of the people protesting.\n\nThis is barely the tip of the iceberg of our ruling party, just to give you an idea of how much they hate their own people. Don\u2019t even get me started and constant censorship, media control, rigged elections, threats etc. When you are this oppressed by your own government, protests like this are everyone\u2019s duty and it\u2019s not that difficult to organize.",

I do care about the issue but if I were in the position, I wouldn't risk the livelihood of my family, kids, job security, and safety to go protest unless an issue directly impacted me extremely deeply. we aren't at that point yet, maybe the ones losing social security, Medicaid, snap, and financial assistance for education and housing are. it just hasn't reached that breaking point for a lot of the working class (yet).",
