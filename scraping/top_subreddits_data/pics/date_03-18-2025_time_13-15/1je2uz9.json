From 1913 on, Zapatista colonel Amelio Robles \u00c1vila (1889-1984) threatened to shoot anyone that called him a woman with his pistol. He lived openly as a man for 71 years and was supported by his family, peers, and government.\n\nMore information https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelio_Robles_%C3%81vila\n\n> According to historian Gabriela Cano Ortega, Robles adopted a male identity not as a survival strategy but because of a strong desire to be a man.[9][18] Robles's male identity was accepted by family, society, and the Mexican government, and Robles lived as a man from the age of 24 until his death.[9] According to a former neighbor, if anyone called Robles a woman or Do\u00f1a (an honorific for women, similar to English Mrs.), he would threaten them with a pistol.[12] Robles has therefore been described by historians as transgender.[11][18][19]\nRobles is documented using both the masculine and feminine versions of his name and pronouns. Robles is both commemorated as a male hero of the Mexican revolution and iconized as a female warrior.[20]\n\n> Robles met \u00c1ngela Torres in Apipilulco in the 1930s, and they later married.[7][9] They adopted a daughter together, Regula Robles Torres.[14] Horacio Legr\u00e1s says that both later became estranged from Robles.[3] On his deathbed Robles supposedly made two requests, to receive honors for his military service and to be dressed as a woman in order to commend his soul to God.[7][15] \n\n>Neither request was ever confirmed to be true,[15] and Robles had already received several military honors. Furthermore, Robles's death certificate notes that he lost the ability to speak more than a year before dying.[16]\n\n>Robles died 9 December 1984, aged 95.[17]",

                                    "body": "I think there might be some confusion. The Mexican Revolution Zapatistas and the modern-day Zapatistas are NOT the same.\n\nThe Mexican Revolution's Ej\u00e9rcito Libertador del Sur (called Zapatistas, as Emiliano Zapata Salazar was their leader) was an anarchoagrarian conservative militia that wanted to restore the rights rural and other indigenous communities had before Mexican Independence, and specially before the Reform Laws in the state of Morelos. They were deeply catholic and were known, as most factions of the Mexican Revolution, to kill those who opposed them in their controlled terrotory. The Revolution's Zapatistas were some of the most unreliable allies in the Revolution, rebelling against the revolutionary idealist, President Francisco Ignacio Madero Gomz\u00e1lez, 22 days after he took office, and later when they joined the Convencionista faction (the Revolutionary Convention) and made war against the Constitucionalistas (the Revolutionary Interim Government), the Zapatistas refused to campaign outside their sphere of influence in Morelos, even after his ally Francisco Villa was in urgent need of reinforcements, which ultimately led to the almost total annihilation of the Villistas and the full isolation of the Zapatistas, who would be forced to make peace and join with the revolutionary government after Zapata's assassination.\n\nThe modern-day Zapatistas are the Ej\u00e9rcito Zapatista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional, a decentralised indigenous anarchist movement in the isolated communities of the north/north-east of Chiapas. They rose up in arms to fight against the Mexican government, claiming they wanted to depose it in its entirety in 1994, when NAFTA came into effect, as they were/are opposed to the idea of free trade capitalism. After some very early successes in their offensive to capture some towns and cities in Chiapas, the Mexican Military absolutely crushed them. But the war was extremely unpopular with the Mexican public, who not only sympathised with the indigenous people for the poor conditions they live in (which the Zapatista charismatic spokesperson, Subcommander Marcos, was able to use in their favour to win support) but also because the Mexican public absolutely despised the governing PRI (the party that evolved from the revolutionary government) who had autocratically ruled Mexico non-stop since the end of the revolution. The Zapatistas lost the military war, but they won the propaganda one, allowing them many concessions from the government (quasi-independent autonomy and no military bases in their territory) even if they continually accuse the government, both federal and Chiapas state, to continue a shadow war against them. Due to their nature as an anarchist group, the Zapatista territory is not centralised under a single government but rather it is somewhat like an alliance of independent villages and communities, which all govern themselves as direct democracies. Sadly, this usually results in non-standard rules all across their territory. Some towns prohibit non-locals for staying the night or else be jailed/fined for it, some towns prohibit their inhabitants from practicing a different christian denomination to the one the town has made the official faith, most towns have draconian prohibitions of drugs (including alchohol), and sometimes lgbt+ and other \"undesirables\" are exiled from a town for breaking a communal law, which then results in those exiles founding a new town and later exile people of their own. Currently the Zapatistas are fleeing their territory as organised crime has taken advantage of their decentralised weakness and are wreaking havoc to the region with total impunity.",

Or that if a hypothetical religion insisted that their men be categorised as not-men by the judicial system, you would be okay with that?\n\nTransgenderism is a product of the brain, but it is deeply dangerous to state that it is biological because then people will start proscribing transgenderism on people instead of waiting for people to reach their own decision.  It is a construct of the mind, and so ephemeral, changeable and ultimately, irrational.  Just like a preference for a certain food, or love for a certain person, or film, or book.  It is very useful to understand that oneself is irrational, and that ones own experiences are, in many ways, the *least* useful in determining truth.\n\nClaiming that a person's gender identify is more important than society's needs to usefully categorise \\[biological\\] men and \\[biological\\] women is both fundamentally illiberal and deeply unpragmatic - *particularly because it seems to be impossible to know if someone truly feels trans or if they are faking it!*  (A strange side note to the story that seems to say: someone who declares themselves trans is incapable of falsehood on the same subject).\n\nYou ask society to take someone on their word (something no court of law would accept as evidence) that a man should be given access to women's safe spaces!  This is the fundamental issue feminists like JK Rowling and others have with the modern transgender movement.  \n\nWe can be supportive and welcoming and loving of transgender people, whilst not agreeing with nor adopting their belief that they are the gender they identify as.   \n  \nWe can normalise and ensure understanding of *\"My passport says I am a man, but I identify as a women.\"*  We are unlikely to normalise *\"Despite the beard and penis I insist that you categorise me as a women.\"*  We find the compromise.",

I don\u2019t know exactly what definition you would personally bring up but I\u2019ll just bring up a couple common ones.\n\n\u201cBiological\u201d male and female isn\u2019t really a thing, and least not precisely. You can tell that because people always bring up different definitions, or they have to ignore exceptions.\n\n\u201cBiological sex is based on chromosomes\u201d what about people who we would typically consider female who have XY chromosomes and people we would usually consider male who have XX? Or people who have XXY chromosomes, or one of the other variations?\n\n\u201cBiological sex is based on your reproductive organs.\u201d So if you don\u2019t have a uterus, but you do have a vagina, are you a woman? If the answer is yes, would trans women who have gotten bottom surgery be biological women? If no, would they be biological men, even though after bottom surgery they won\u2019t have a penis and won\u2019t produce sperm either?\n\nThis isn\u2019t a scenario of trans people telling biologists to change their definitions to things that are just not true, this is just a case of biology being messy. Because in biology we like to come up with neat boxes to put things in, but nature doesn\u2019t actually work that way. We have like a dozen definitions of the word species, and that\u2019s like a really big part of biology. Darwin literally wrote a book called \u201cOrigin of the Species\u201d and there isn\u2019t a singular good definition for what a species even is. \n\nI guess my point is that people think that biological sex is a lot more objective than it really is. It\u2019s not anywhere near as clear cut as people make it sound.\n\nSociety also doesn\u2019t really have a strong reason to separate trans women from women\u2019s spaces. There is no evidence to suggest that allowing trans women in those spaces does anything to increase the risk of harm. If you are suggesting otherwise then provide evidence otherwise you are just fear mongering to try and justify your transphobia.",

As I understand it, having one X chromosome makes you a male.  So XYY XYYY XXY XXYY XYYYYYY etc are all male.\n\nI do think a lot of *\"we need to fit in the fact that trans-women are exactly the same as women\" -* a political position - is causing people to overthink, and underthink, some pretty fundamental biological ideas.\n\nSex is an evolutionary process that uses males and females to allow species to both specialise and maximise successful evolutionary pressures, whilst remaining efficient (i.e. we don't need 3 separate sexes to create offspring).\n\nIt is more simple than you want it to be, because it doesn't need to work around the fallacy that men are the same as women so long as they identify as such.\n\nSociety has a fantastic reason to separate trans-women from women's spaces.  Trans-women are men who identify as women.  If they weren't men, then they wouldn't be trans, and we wouldn't be having this conversation.  And you don't have to look far to see why men are considered dangerous.  Apparently women would rather meet a bear than a strange man in the woods (which says a lot about the average person's understanding of nature).\n\nAnd no, not transphobic.  I don't hate or fear trans people.  Nor would I go around saying these things to trans people because I wouldn't want people to be uncomfortable.  Just like I don't walk up to the religious and tell them that they believe in nonsense.\n\nBut in a public forum, debating this point, saying I hate people because I don't agree with the significance they attach to their identity or your argument, is reductive and offensive (but utterly expected!).",

This is what I mean when I say you only have a basic understanding of biology. It is not anywhere near as clear cut as you are saying it is.\n\nI never said trans women are exactly the same as cis women. Trans women are women though.

You would need to back that up with some evidence. There are actually studies you can look at that compares places with trans inclusive bathroom laws with places that don\u2019t have those and they found no difference.\n\nI really wonder what you think being transphobic means if not believing trans people are actually the gender they say they are, and also believing that trans women are a threat to cis women, isn\u2019t transphobic. Those are two beliefs that are almost definitionally transphobic. You claim you don\u2019t hate trans people. Cool. You just think they\u2019re delusional and a threat to women.

In the medical field, we use the term man to refer to an adult human male \u2014 a biological classification, not a gendered identity. Similarly, woman refers to an adult human female. These terms are rooted in biology, not social identity.\n\nThe term trans woman makes sense because it accurately describes someone who identifies as a woman but was born male. However, the distinction between biological sex and gender identity becomes critical in certain situations \u2014 particularly in sports and discussions about women's rights.\n\nIn sports, my nieces are competing against biological males who identify as females, and the biological differences are undeniable. This is creating an imbalance that's changing the landscape of women's athletics.\n\nWhen it comes to women's rights, the question becomes: Should biological men \u2014 regardless of their gender identity \u2014 have a say in issues that uniquely affect women? If someone can simply claim a female identity to participate in these conversations, it raises concerns about fairness and respect for the experiences of biological women.\n\nAcknowledging these distinctions isn\u2019t about denying anyone\u2019s identity \u2014 it\u2019s about ensuring that conversations and policies remain grounded in reality where biology has meaningful implications.",

It's not an inherent truth. \n\nSomeone who is born a biological male has a penis and testicles (the vast majority of the time). That's not a choice. But whether we call them \"sir\" or \"ma'am\" is simply a social norm. There's nothing forcing anyone to adhere to them.\n\nCan a biological male become pregnant? No. Does that mean we have to call them \"sir\" instead of \"ma'am\"? Also no.",

What happens with social constructs is that they are assumptions made based on culture. Nearly all the characteristics assigned to 'men' can be adopted by both sexes, the same goes for 'women'.\n\nSex characteristics' presentation are harder to change because they're tied to our internal biology, but the modern world allows for such change to some extent.\n\nFurthermore, what's the purpose of treating someone as they do not see themselves? Would you be comfortable if anyone treated you as the gender you are not? Or as the culture you are not, or on negative assumptions about it? What's the harm in letting people decide what they want to be and treating them as such?\n\nDoes them having a gender you are not expecting harms you in any way? \n\nDo you care about how other human beings feel?

Let\u2019s be realistic here, trans people will always have to be docile to the heteronormative population that make up the other 99%. What you\u2019re doing is merely fantasizing about an alternative reality. It will never happen.\n\nThere are many laws on the books that are outdated but have not been removed, and therefore aren\u2019t enforced at all. Furthermore, if the current administration in America has shown anything, laws in general only mean something if there is someone to uphold and enforce it. Quite frankly, it has never been a better time in recent history (at least in America) to get in a deadly confrontation with a trans person and get off scott-free even if you DID provoke the altercation \u2026 and if you lost the altercation, the trans person would likely be charged with murder.\u00a0\n\nTLDR: trans people are still fucked no matter how you slice it \u2026 best not to encourage them to provoke the bear.",

In the medical field, we use the term man to refer to an adult human male \u2014 a biological classification, not a gendered identity. Similarly, woman refers to an adult human female. These terms are rooted in biology, not social identity.\n\nThe term trans woman makes sense because it accurately describes someone who identifies as a woman but was born male. However, the distinction between biological sex and gender identity becomes critical in certain situations \u2014 particularly in sports and discussions about women's rights.\n\nIn sports, my nieces are competing against biological males who identify as females, and the biological differences are undeniable. This is creating an imbalance that's changing the landscape of women's athletics.\n\nWhen it comes to women's rights, the question becomes: Should biological men \u2014 regardless of their gender identity \u2014 have a say in issues that uniquely affect women? If someone can simply claim a female identity to participate in these conversations, it raises concerns about fairness and respect for the experiences of biological women.\n\nAcknowledging these distinctions isn\u2019t about denying anyone\u2019s identity \u2014 it\u2019s about ensuring that conversations and policies remain grounded in reality where biology has meaningful implications.",

But here is another perspective to consider: they want the fact that they are trans to be acknowledged because they want people to know that they had a long journey to get where they are.\n\nI do not doubt that there are some who just want attention and to feel like they are \"special and different\". Usually these are younger people who are still exploring themselves. So i give them a bit of leeway.\n\nMost trans people that I know feel good when someone doesn't notice they are trans because they are doing so well with their appearance.\n\nAnother thing to note when it comes to trans men especially is that they are often forgotten and overlooked when talking about trans issues. The topic of trans people almost always revolves around trans women, be it praising someone for their journey or some of the more negative accusations that are often thrown about. So wanting to be seen as a trans man instead of just a man could also be about reminding people that trans men do exist and also face issues worth discussing.\n\nAs for the point of transitioning. It is a body comfort thing. It is not meant to hide what sex they were born as, but to change themselves to feel like their appearance/behavior/ect match their gender identity. They are a man. But they are not a cis man. Their lived experience is not going to be the same as a cis man and that is important. \n\nOverall gender expression, gender identity, and how people want theirs to be perceived is very hard to generalize.\n\nIt is easy to label things as just attention seeking or being a contrarian. It takes effort and empathy to try and understand a deeper meaning.\n\nAnyways, this comment ended up rather long. I hope you have a wonderful day.",

This is an archaic tactic used for decades by the right flank to rile up their base against their fellow Americans. These commie leftists you speak of exist only in your mind, making them imaginary. Perhaps some exist, but they do not speak for the whole, just as the right would say swastika waving nut jobs don\u2019t speak for them. I could label every single conservative as a nazi but that would be wrong. \n\nHow is your quote out of context? You cherry picked a single sentence from an hour long philosophical lecture by Alan Watts called, \u201cMind Over Mind\u201d In which he discusses a myriad of philosophical topics from different perspectives, mainly the topic of self improvement. That quote had nothing to do with the political machinations of today but was a continuation of a previous point about self-improvement and hypocrisy. Nuance and context matter. It is easy to apply out of context quotes to fit one\u2019s narrative. His point stands but across all spectrums, not just \u201cleftists\u201d as you put it. \n\nThe first couple sentences lay out his intentions clearly. \u201cThe general title of these talks that I\u2019m giving here is Mind over Mind, and I\u2019m going into all the various problems which have to do with the control of the mind. And so I might introduce what I\u2019m going to say by saying it from different points of view.\u201d - Alan Watts\n\nHere\u2019s the full lecture for anyone who\u2019s interested. \nhttps://www.organism.earth/library/document/mind-over-mind",

Just as I wouldn\u2019t call every Trump supporter a nazi, even though there are literal nazis waving swastikas who support our current administration. \n\nI agree with you on the fluidity of philosophy and people will have their own take every time.

Also valuable to note hypothesis are testable statements to which the previous fact remains true until otherwise proven with adequate and re-testable data. Life, science, sociology - it\u2019s all constantly evolving hence what was once held as fact before can change in the future as we progress as societies \u2026 the same logic remains, however, without enough evidence and statistical information, no statement of fact can be made as an absolute rule. And everyone should be able to agree that misinformation is harmful and should not be spread, especially if the goal is maliciousness or, \u201cacting out on feelings, not logic\u201d. That goes against the very frame of logic and fact.\n\nAlso if anyone wants to make a claim but then states providing actual, peer-reviewed evidence is too much work - don\u2019t make the claim. Thats just a rule in science and statistics. I don\u2019t make the rules.",
