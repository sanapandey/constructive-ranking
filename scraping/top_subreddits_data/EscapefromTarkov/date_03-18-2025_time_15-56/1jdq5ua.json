Their goal should be to be in the more vulnerable position and guiding you towards coop extract. Your goal is to not trust them and kill them the moment they break from the above guidelines.\n\nI've extracted several times via coop extracts following the above logic. \n\nAlternative as a PMC is to take a scav hostage. Make it very clear if they don't pull melee they die instantly. To avoid a situation where they try their luck fighting it out, it is in your best interest to do this as a group of PMCs and to offer loot gifts immediately. Makes sure they know cooperating leads to guaranteed loot. Fighting may or may not lead to better gear. Their Choice. If you just took them hostage and didn't give them gifts they may just refuse because they lose nothing by trying to fight. Your gifts make them invested.",

So of course I shot him again. \u201cAnd he was like what happened to a truce.\u201d So I stoped shooting him and he killed me. Said not nice things as well.\n\nThat being said I would say atleast 80% of diplomatic situations where they respond and we agree to something goes positive. A couple of things help.
