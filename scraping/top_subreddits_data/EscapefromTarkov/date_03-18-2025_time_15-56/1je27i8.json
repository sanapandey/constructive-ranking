    "selftext": "Obvious stuff at the start:\n\nAI should be capable and deadly in both gamemodes, especially Raiders/Guards/AI PMCs. This includes the ability to shoot precisely and potentially oneshotting you.\n\nBut while i fully agree i still feel frustrated when dealing with these a lot - and for the longest time i couldnt put the finger on why that is. And maybe the answer is very obvious for some of the more experienced players out there. But at least for me it took a while to click.\n\nThey simply invalidate any kind of good positioning. Even after the latest patches strategies that give you an edge against even very good players simply do not work on them. Lining up a shot through a thin gap between cover normally makes it hard for enemy PMCs to precisely spot you and line up a return shot unless they got a good scope and time to aim.\n\nYet AI has no issue to get hit, turn around and instantly punish you with a throat shot through what should be a needle thin gap between two pieces of cover.\n\nSame for shooting at incomfortable angles like straight down from a roof (which normally gives an advantage to the player below that is firing upwards.\n\nOther examples are millisecond reaction shots when you move between two pieces of cover and are visible to them for just an instant.\n\n  \nAI seems to fluctuate between being complete and utter amateurs unable to spot you until you are right on top of them and being able to repeatedly deliver extreme human (arguably superhuman) levels of precision and reaction time (and spotting ability)\n\n  \nAnd honestly speaking...i dont even have a solution. Maybe to some degree increasing the grouping size of their shots could make a difference. But do it too much and you go against the original goal of them being competent and deadly. And any complex solution like calculating how likely a human would be to make this shot in this specific scenario would only add needlessly expensive computation.\n\nOf course being Ai they are still exploitable. Especially if you have grenades. But to be honest winning only because you exploit the same strategy over and over isnt exactly my definition of fun either. If just winning easily against them is the point we wouldnt need to make them good in the first place.",

This is a depth of misunderstanding that is honestly a little weird if you have any experience using a computer at all.

I also explicitly stated this is an exaggerated example to show why complex AI scales badly and it would be absolutely insane. But it would in theory be possible and would work and could take things like lighting, reflections and so on into account that are commonly not used for AI behavior.\n\nImagine I wanted to make AI react to the lighting glint on a reflective surface with low angle incoming light, aiming above water into a sunrise for example. Because the randomly moving, very bright reflections would obviously make target detection much harder for a human but only in a small area right behind the reflection. How would you do that? You could cast a ray into the water surface, then reflect it into the lightsource, calculate obstruction of the lightsource by geometry, calculate surface reflection angle, check this angle against a reflection formula to get glint intensity, add some randomness \u2026 well now you effectively rendered a single pixel from the perspective of the AI.\n\nAgain, please tell me, where exactly is my misunderstanding?",

Don't try to be cheeky towards AI. Just shoot them and don't overexpose yourself unnecessarily. Don't get cocky or overconfident, either. Many AI deaths that I've seen seem to just be people getting greedy, and staying exposed to take more shots at an AI that's already locked on them, then they get roasted and cry 'aimbot'. \n\nMany people in their head go \"It's just a scav\" then don't break contact, while the scav locks on their face. Then they cry about getting insta-killed by a 'broken ass AK' that's unrealistic. Another mistake I see is on scavs with slower rate of fire guns, they feel safer because there's less rounds coming towards them, but what they fail to realize, is when they're staying exposed for all that time with the slow shooting scav, that scav is still locking onto your face in between shots. Then you get 'miss'-'miss'-'head tap' \n\n  \nTLDR: Once AI notices you, you need to constantly break contact with AI or you will get roasted.",
