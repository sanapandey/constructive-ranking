Then you can try some pmc raids with the gear and money you get.\n\nJust focus on a few maps \u00a0at a time to learn. Customs and woods are good ones because lots of early quests are there. You can do some scav raids to try those out, but for me jamming a factory scav quickly and then doing a pmc raid is a quick way to get some money.",

Most players are considered \u201cnew\u201d until they\u2019re close to 1000 hrs because Tarkov is really a game of knowledge. The best thing to do is find someone to play with that can help show you the ropes to accelerate your learning. The official EFT Discord is one place to look, or most of the streamers have Discords as well. Absolutely under no circumstance should you ever match with randoms in the game lobby. Those people WILL kill you as soon as you spawn in.\n\nPVE won\u2019t give you the same highs and lows that you get in PVP, but you\u2019re welcome to try.\n\nScav every chance you get, it gives you an opportunity to explore without being harassed by AI and you don\u2019t take a financial hit if you die. Also, try to pick one map and learn it fairly well before moving on. Also use your scav to learn loot runs. File cabinets and tool boxes are going to be your best friend for upgrading hideout and for quest items. When you have about 1.4M rubles it\u2019s probably a safe time to consider buying a junk box to put all your barter items in. You\u2019re eventually going to want multiple junk boxes to hoard all the items you\u2019re going to need. There are charts on the wiki and elsewhere that have a full list of all the hideout and quest items you\u2019re going to need. Only prioritize initial hideout module and quest items at first, otherwise you\u2019re going to be overwhelmed with shit you don\u2019t need.\n\nAmmo and armor are of absolute importance. At this point in the wipe everyone is running a minimum of Tier 4 armor, and you want to be running ammo that has at least 40 pen to defeat that armor. Use eft-ammo.com to get an understanding of what ammo to run.\n\nDon\u2019t re-peek scavs from the same angle, that\u2019s a good way to end up dead. Try to peek them from different cover.",

Dying is learning, you need to die to understand where and how you can die. Next raid you'll be more cautious through that section or check that window or door. As long as you treat every death as a lesson you'll learn. As people have said learn the maps, hell even if you just play one or two maps over and over and learn them inside out, you'll get better at PVP and will be able to take that knowledge into different maps.
