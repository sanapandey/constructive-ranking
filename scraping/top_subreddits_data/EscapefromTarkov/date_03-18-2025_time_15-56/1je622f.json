Until BSG adds a death cam after the raid ends for everyone we will never know for stuff like this.\n\nI have been both you and them many times in tarkov.\n\nIn old factory, the staircase that goes from glass hall/forklift and leads to the key exit. I was in the hallway underneath looking up. The key exit door to my back.\n\nI had the old ww2 4x scope on my mosin looking up though the crack and nailed someone wearing an altyn with snb the moment their head appeared while they were full sprint heading to glass hallway.\n\nSometimes you just get stupid lucky shots. Sometimes they are just hackers.\n\nAlso something to consider. Im not saying they were legit or not. Just could be a factor in this.\n\nIf you have an HDR monitor and set you your post fx right. You can see inside buildings as clear as day. HDR is a cheatcode in tarkov and Im surprised its not talked about more. When doing dome sniping on reserve. Before I had my new monitor looking in the door on the roof of white knight or in the windows on black knight or the various garage entrances on the building that follows k fields. It was just a black void. You could be standing in the window on the other side and I would never know.\n\nGot a new monitor with HDR. On stock settings I was blown away with how well I could see into outside in. All of them while dome sniping I can see into clearly now.  That got me curious and I looked up an HDR youtube video for tarkov. Its a bit bright and whitewashed outside I will admit. But being inside a dark room looking out doesnt stop me from seeing you as clearly as standing in direct sunlight.\n\nThat could be some of this, combined with de-sync. Or they are walling. We will never know.",
