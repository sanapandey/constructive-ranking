    "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nThis is an open letter from the coordinating team of the Sherpa Hub, on behalf of ourselves and the wider Sherpa team.\n\nThroughout the 6 year existence of the Sherpa Program our primary focus has been to help new players adapt to the harsh, unforgiving realities of Escape from Tarkov.\n\nIt may be now your turn! We in the North America region as well as some parts of EU are currently looking for a select few people to take on the challenge of sherpaing new players in the game. We are looking for players with good experience and good teaching ability. If you can wipe lobbies without breaking a sweat that is amazing and good on you. It's a rare skill. But we need you to be able to articulate how you do that to a player getting their feet wet in Tarkov.\n\nRequirements\n\nBe able to stay calm in stressful situations\n\nBe able to dedicate some time teaching new players each month and fulfill and complete tickets\n\nBe passionate about the game and be willing to help players of all skill levels\n\nPatience\n\nExperience is key if you know 1 map really well that's great but we are looking for some of tarkov\u2019s most knowledgeable players to assist the people just starting out.\n\nIf you think you may be one of the players fill out one of these [https://forms.gle/VZm1vq3cniuMiQSJ9](https://forms.gle/VZm1vq3cniuMiQSJ9)\n\nWe also ask that you join the sherpa hub discord if you are not already there.  [https://discord.gg/sherpahub](https://discord.gg/sherpahub)\n\nHere we have additional information regarding the position and the process. [https://discord.gg/gKBvpkXs](https://discord.gg/gKBvpkXs)\n\nYou can also reach out to me personally on discord - gunnerdoor\n\nyou can also reach out to afraid\n\nHere are some additional facts about the sherpa program for those who may be interested\n\nSome interesting facts about the Sherpa Program:\n\nOur roster currently consists of 67 Sherpas, speaking 20 different languages.\n\nSince the inception of the hub, we have managed (completed/closed/whatever) just over 17,000 tickets.\n\nSherpa Hub also has Helpful Members - the next generation of aspiring Sherpas, who spend their time assisting the community and being mentored by a team of Mentor Sherpas, whose main goal is to get future candidates ready to start their journey as fully fledged Sherpas..\n\nSherpas who meet the quality and volume criteria of successful tickets by the end of the month (which usually is around 10 for Standard pack and 16 for Advanced pack) will get a sign of appreciation from BSG as an in-game package, which usually consists of meds and ammo. This is done to compensate not only the time spent voluntarily but also compensate for potential in-game gear lost by helping newer players. Meeting this criteria is no easy task - it usually takes more than 20 hours in a month!",
