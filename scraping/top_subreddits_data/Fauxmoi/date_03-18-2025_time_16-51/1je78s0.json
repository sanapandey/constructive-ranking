Dolan (owner) would\u2019ve kicked him out rather than making him basically a spokesperson (local cable provider and MSG were fighting for a while). \n\nI realize the timing of it being St. Patty\u2019s Day might raise eyebrows but he also had a TBI, is diabetic, and is an organ transplant recipient. People wanting to assume the worst despite that being public info and make fun of a possible relapse sucks. Glad it\u2019s just food poisoning despite people already doubting him.
