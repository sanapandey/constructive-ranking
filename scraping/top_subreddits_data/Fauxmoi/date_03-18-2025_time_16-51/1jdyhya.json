There's a few characters from the first one and almost nothing from the first one really matters in it. I don't think it's impossible to start with Deadhouse Gates (and it's hell of a lot better book).

You cannot take people's homes bc someone else is oppressing you. You cannot block aid to a population you've occupied. You cannot run an apartheid state. You cannot force people into violence and then claim to be the victims. \n\nThere's a reason we have self-defense as a legal defense in this country. You can't oppress someone and take away their ability to fight back legally and then be mad when they turn to violence. I don't want any innocent people getting killed, but what are people supposed to do when there are no legal mechanisms for fighting back? Should people just let themselves be displaced and starve?",

You don\u2019t have to say much and it doesn\u2019t take much time but it MATTERS. Make sure you\u2019re only contacting the reps for your district, besides Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer. If you contact Jeffries and Schumer, ask them to step up their messaging and put up more of a fight/support their members better! Also, Impeachment begins in the House, just saying. \ud83d\ude0e \n\nYou don\u2019t need to say any magic words, just let these reps know what the current administration is doing is unacceptable and you\u2019re unwilling to let it become the new normal. If you\u2019re feeling scared, angry, unprepared, confused, whatever - tell them! Even if you don\u2019t get a response, your communication will at least be read and saved by staffers.\n\nThere\u2019s [5calls.org](https://5calls.org/) to help you find your reps and call them automatically. \n\nIf you\u2019d prefer to email, you can find your rep through Congress\u2019 website [Find Your Congressional Reps](https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member)\n\nIf you like doing a little extra (guilty as charged) FaxZero allows you to send up to five free faxes a day! [FaxZero](https://faxzero.com/). Again, please make sure you\u2019re only sending things to YOUR reps - you don\u2019t want any members of either party to say \u201coh they\u2019re just \u201cbad actors\u201d filling up our inboxes\u201d. \n\nCALL THEM. FAX THEM. EMAIL THEM. We live in a democracy, so these people work for US. Boycotts and other protests are actually working, let\u2019s get loud with our reps so they understand we expect them to do everything in their power to stop this!!",
