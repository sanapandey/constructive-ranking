    "selftext": ">Zegler, 23, told Allure magazine in a cover story published online Tuesday, March 18 that Grande, 31, is among those who have lent their support to her in recent weeks. \"She reached out to me \u2014 kind of apropos of nothing \u2014 and was like, 'If you need anything, I am here,' \" Zegler said. \"She is so deeply kind. She has gone through so much in the public eye, and I have always really, really admired her courage in the face of all of that.\" \n\n\n\n>In addition to Grande, whose big screen role as Glinda in Wicked put her in the spotlight for the last several months, Zegler also said that The Good Place star Jameela Jamil was \"like a big sister to me\" while she discussed her experiences working in Hollywood and racist fan backlash that erupted after Disney cast a Latina woman to portray the fairy tale's title character.\n\n\n\n>Zegler also said Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu \u2014 whom she costarred with in 2023's Shazam! Fury of the Gods \u2014 \u201chave been my keepers in all of this, where I feel very held by them.\u201d ",

Evenmoreso with how Rachel basically arrived as a lead actress, she had a career start that's unheard of.  She went from high school to working with Steven Spielberg, being a Disney Princess and starring in a major YA franchise back to back.",
