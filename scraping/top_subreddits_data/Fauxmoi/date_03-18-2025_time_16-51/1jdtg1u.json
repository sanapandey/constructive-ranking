She was one of approximately 800 ethnically European white Americans imprisoned at 53 internment camps. \n\nLike all Japanese Americans and non-Japanese Americans who were taken to camps, the Ishigos' house, car and bank accounts were confiscated by the government when they were sent to a relocation center. When they were released from the camp years later, they had nothing but $25 and a train ticket. Many were homeless or living in poverty in the first few years. Almost all were given just $100 as compensation years later for the loss of their confiscated possessions. Anyway, I got her book after seeing Steven Okazaki's Oscar-winning short documentary *Days of Waiting* (1990) about her. \n\nA shout out to artist Min\u00e9 Okubo's graphic novel *Citizen 13660* about her and her brother Benji's experiences at a camp as well.",
