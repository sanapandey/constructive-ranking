At this point I fully believe it's it's deliberate tbh because why is she being platformed to complain about how unfair media is to her as an Israeli (LOL) and talk (lie) about how she's 'indigenous' to Israel and an 8th generation Israeli right after this settler colony commits a fucking massacre? \n\nAt least get someone how can act for your propaganda smh",

The stars can be damaged easily and are often vandalised (Trump has one from doing The Apprentice and someone took a sledgehammer to it a few years back) so it covers a lot of expense.\n\nMovie studios will try to get them to promote a movie but it's very difficult to get those things to line up, because if you get nominated for the Walk of Fame you only have two years to organise the ceremony.\n\nSo in the case of Gal Gadot they would have put in the nomination in a couple of years back and allowed her management or Disney to select this date to coincide with the release of Snow White.",
