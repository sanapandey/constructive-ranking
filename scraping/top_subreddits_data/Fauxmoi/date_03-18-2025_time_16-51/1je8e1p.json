I think the thing that I took the most was my relationships. That\u2019s my family. I love them.\u201d  \n\n\n\n>\u201cBeing on that show was really special because I was able to go set every single day knowing that I was in a safe space, getting to do something that I could only ever dream of doing,\u201d she says. \u201cStepping into the most amazing shoes every single day and playing my dream character and having fun, but still being able to be a kid while doing it.\u201d  \n\n\n\n>\u201cI feel like it's just set me up for so many things in my life that I feel like if I hadn't gone through that I would not be able to handle it the way that I did because of that,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt was such a beautiful experience. I look back on it, and yes, as with everything, there was ups and downs, but that is probably the most obviously life-changing experience for me.\u201d\u00a0",

I believe the Sprouse brothers also said similar things when talking about the show and Kim Rhodes who played their mom!\n\nIt\u2019s really telling how the cast speaks so positively of the show after all these years and that the cast still interact with each other from time to time.",
