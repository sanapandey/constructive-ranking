But even in his UFC prime, there were a very many who detested him in Ireland seeing him as obnoxious and being somewhat embarrassed that he was our most famous export at the time. Especially when he was going to fight Khabib and went after his wife and late father. Despicable stuff overall. He also punched an elder gentleman, and being the petty cunt that he is, decided to buy the elder gentleman's favourite pub and ban him from it. But this all pretty much pales in comparison to his recent rape trial where he was accused by a woman named Nikita Hand. A case which Nikita eventually won. Connor is a scumbag, a goon and a convicted rapist. It irks me deeply everytime I see him robed in our flag. Let the Yanks have him.",
