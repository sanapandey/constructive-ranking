And assuming they could buy them, there's no country insane enough to pour billions of their own money into Israel's war effort for nothing in return other than the US. I'm not sure if they even have the ability to store and maintain the weapons they're using as much of that happens in the American and British military base on Cyprus.\u00a0",
