Like, she\u2019s so pretty and \u201cperfect\u201d that I almost notice a subconscious auto-dismissal, like with mannequins or something. I do tend to like unique faces/looks., I realize this. But I feel like there\u2019s usually something in even las unique faces that somehow signal an essence of *something* that is missing for me.\n\nNot bashing on her. I have no idea who she is other than an upcoming actress in the live action Snow White movie. I actually have just seen her photo spreads more this week on my Reddit front page, and every time I look through, I catch myself glazing over and can\u2019t seem to focus on the image because of my brain not registering her as real.\n\nIt\u2019s very odd!",
