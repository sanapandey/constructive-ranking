But if it's kinda niche and in line with their passion then I'm less judgmental. (Like they care what I think lol they're not getting any of my money either way)\n\n\n I'm trying to think of a celeb with a side hustle that doesn't bother me and I'm only coming up with Kaley Cuoco who sells something for dogs (I can't remember) bc she's literally obsessed with her animals. Also I'm not really a Jessica Simpson fan but I respect all those clothes and shoes and bags she sells bc I really think she likes it and at least it's somewhat affordable",
