If he wants to go on a 6+ month long tirade harassing others, doxxing others and their families and sending his rabid fanbase to go harass them over what he believes is antisemitism, maybe ... just maybe he shouldn't be doing a nazi salute live on air multiple times. If he really cares about being a serious authority on the topic of antisemitism, it isn't wise to openly be \"funny\" about it by doing a nazi salute. It just invalidates his whole movement and reassures others that they can't take him seriously",
