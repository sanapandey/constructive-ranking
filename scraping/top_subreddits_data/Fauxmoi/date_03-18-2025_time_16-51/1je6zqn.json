Also The Albertan Premier and mps have been labeled traitors by most of the public due to their unwavering support to the orange man south of the border",

It's likely Carney will call an election before next week. Make sure you go to Elections Canada to see if you're registered to vote. Also go to [Smart Voting ](https://smartvoting.ca/federaldashboard) to see if you need vote strategically in your riding.",
