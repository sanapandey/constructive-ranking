People like you are holding our species back. Do you understand how much time was saved if AI was used to make this?! AI is where the vast majority of the first world's resources need to be placed in in order for the next technological revolution to happen, thus creating the next boom cycle and jobs that didn't exist before.\n\nThe more people like you stigmatize AI because of, I don't know, probably, uneducated or undereducated fear, the more it slows down our progress.
