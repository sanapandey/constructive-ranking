As a result, we are implementing a zero-tolerance policy effective immediately.**\n\n**Here's what you need to know:**\n\n1. **No Political Content**: Memes involving political figures, events, or ideologies will be removed, and the user will face a permanent ban without warning.\n2. **No Sexist Content**: Any meme or comment that promotes sexism or degrades individuals based on gender will result in an immediate permanent ban.\n3. **No Hate Speech Against Religion**: Memes or comments spreading hate against any religion will lead to a direct permanent ban.\n4. **No Toxic Behavior**: Any form of toxic behavior, including harassment or excessively negative comments, will not be tolerated and will result in a permanent ban.\n\n**Why are we doing this?**\nOur goal is to maintain a fun and inclusive community where everyone can enjoy and share memes without encountering offensive or harmful content. We take these rules seriously and expect all members to do the same.\n\n**What can you do?**\n1. **Follow the Rules**: Familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules and abide by them.\n2. **Report Violations**: If you see any rule violations, report them to the mods so we can take appropriate action.\n3. **Stay Positive**: Keep your memes and comments positive and enjoyable for everyone.\n\nThank you for your cooperation and understanding. Let's keep r/Funnymemes a fun and welcoming place for all!\n\n\u2014 The r/Funnymemes Mod Team",
