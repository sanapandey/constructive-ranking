You also might have a rig that can actually play the game at 100fps+ by then  (GTA V, Witcher3, shadow of mordor for example only achieved that with 1080ti x2 in sli back then, especially if using higher graphics and view distance mods on GTA V).\n\nPlus, most games go on sale 1 to 1.5 years later, though that isn't true of rockstar games for whatever reason.  So there is a sweet spot between \"buying on release\" and \"getting it for free\".   I waited much longer than most games for red dead 2 because rockstar doesn't lower prices for a very long time, but I had a better game, rig+performance, screen tech, and price for the wait.\n\nAlso worth checking the humble bundle/humble choice every month since some games pop up there after awhile that I might have snoozed on entirely.   That and, some people like using game pass and digesting a game while it's on the menu.",
