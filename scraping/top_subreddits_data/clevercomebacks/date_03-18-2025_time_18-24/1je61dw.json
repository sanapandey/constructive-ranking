Very intelligent, master's degree in engineering, worked at GE building jet engines for his entire career, Reads constantly, retains facts, data and information  which he shares to the point that we call him \"Professor\" because he lectures on and on and on about things that he is interested in (whether YOU are interested or not!).  He's an immigrant, has three daughters, three granddaughters, and LOVES Trump. We live in a very blue state, and he says he watches and reads a balanced amount of news (MSNBC, BBC, AP, CNN, FOX....) and he thinks nothing Trump has done so far  this term is wrong.  AND he filled in my dying mother-in-law's absentee ballot by voting for Trump, which she would have never done. (based on that one fraudulent vote alone, Trump's victory was CLEARLY bullshit).  He tries to talk politics with me (like won't wait for me to enter his house with all my family's gear on my shoulders and in my hands when we arrive at his house....he has to talk about it right away on the front lawn..) and I keep saying \"We are completely opposed in our political views, I'd rather not just argue because we'll never see eye-to-eye.\" I just don't understand it.",

I don't understand why you think that's true and I don't know why you continually insist on referring to a movie that is not remotely realistic. \n\nForrest Gump was by modern standards autistic. He's shown to actually be a savant in the book and he even is shown to ***not*** be a bigot (though in the book, bubbah is white and racist). If you're trying to say that stupid and racist are synonymous, which you explicitly did in your first comment, then you can't use Gump as an example of being stupid with his below average intelligence because he is not a racist! \n\nPeople are rarely just one thing. And intelligence, like so many things, is a spectrum and not a straight line. You can be extremely intelligent in some areas and very stupid in others. Like being a talented brain surgeon that thinks Egyptian pyramids were grain silos.",
