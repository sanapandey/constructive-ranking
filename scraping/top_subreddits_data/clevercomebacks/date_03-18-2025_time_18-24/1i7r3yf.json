However, if you're sitting there thinking \"yeah, this'll be a BANGER post\" and cross-posting a substack essay from a different subreddit that doesn't even try to be a response to someone else you're probably just going to tank an insta ban. \n\nYeah, I get it, you don't like this person or that person, but this isn't the subreddit to come and spam your shit. We aren't banning Twitter/X posts - if you haven't noticed they're 90% of this subreddit's content, and we aren't allowing such egregiously off-topic and unrelated posts that don't even try to fit the theme of the sub just because it's in the news cycle.\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to leave them below.",

I'm no longer officially involved in it (I'm not even a mod here anymore), but I felt like I should add my two cents.\n\nThreads are traditionally not locked here because this place is a true Public Square, not because it annoys people. You don't have to worry about getting banned here unless you're breaking the Reddit TOS. Threads are never locked just because they're controversial. Posts are never deleted because someone got called a name. You're all grown adults, and are expected to make your own decisions, exercise your own caution, and use your own critical thinking. You don't need a glorified janitor to do it for you.\n\nWhile a huge majority of subreddits are indeed banning links to twitter (and I wholeheartedly support the ban), it looks like CC will remain a neutral ground as far as content is concerned. I may no longer have an official voice in the direction of the subreddit, but I always believed in it's core tenet of actual freedom of speech, not the Muskrat's weird, \"I'm gonna ban everyone and everything that's negative about me\" version of it. \n\nWhile this decision will make a lot of people upset, I intimately understand why it was made.",

So no, this isn't going to be the magic solution to get rule-breaking, unrelated posts approved here.\n\nYou can post clever comebacks about whatever topic you want, and in fact we encourage that and actually don't care if you go crazy for whatever agenda you have on either side of the aisle. But you can at least do us the courtesy of going to r/substackessays for posting substack essays.\n\nComments are free for all on all posts as per usual, but after careful consideration and deliberation the mod team has decided not to operate as a news subreddit.",
