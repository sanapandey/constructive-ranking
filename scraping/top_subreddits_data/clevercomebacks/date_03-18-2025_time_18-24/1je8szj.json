They've had to borrow hundreds of billions of dollars to do it. So now they have one of the most overfunded pension systems in the entire United States. \n\nAnd both sides of Congress want that money and both sides of Congress have agendas against the post office and that's why it is being run into the ground. \n\nIn most years if you took away that funding mandate the post office would be one to two billion in the black and they would have money to invest in things like new machines and new vehicles.",
