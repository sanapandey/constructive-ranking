There\u2019s major figures in the Republican sphere that are on record saying the only thing that Nazis ever did wrong was that their land grab strategy during the war was too aggressive. There were 3 speakers on the main stage of CPAC this year that did Nazi salutes, one of which was the priest that gave the opening prayer at the event and another was Trump\u2019s former Chief Strategist who is still described as a close ally.\n\nThere is nothing ironic about a Democrat calling people Nazis, the Republicans really are acting like Nazis. And usually when a Republican is trying to call a Democrat a Nazi it\u2019s because the Republicans is experiencing any sort of consequences for their actions for acting like Nazis.",

You don\u2019t get to just grab somebody off the street and deport them to a Supermax prison in another country without any representation or public records. Next they\u2019ll be disappearing Americans that oppose them to the same fucking foreign gulags. Fuck no. The judicial system is there specifically to check that power of the executive. They can\u2019t just skip it because it\u2019s inconvenient, or this isn\u2019t a free country. \n\n>Due process only works when you have a system capable of managing the shear amount of violence in America, which you don\u2019t, you have such a backlog it would take years to reach a point where you could quickly prosecute criminals.\n\nThis is just complete horseshit. These aren\u2019t jury trials and prosecutions. They\u2019re just hearings in front of a judge, who makes sure everything is in order and above board. The individual has the right to have an attorney present to explain what\u2019s happening and argue their case for them. They generally don\u2019t have any actual defense and the whole thing is just a formality, but it\u2019s a crucial step. If we can\u2019t actually provide these protections, then we live in an authoritarian state. It\u2019s as simple as that.",

Also while the EO specifically states it being evoked for a gang from Venezuela the Trump Admin has already admitted that the deportees they sent to El Salvador include more than that group.

Fact is these people, and everyone who steps foot on American soil, has basic rights and one of those is a right to a trial. You people that are so willing to give up such a basic right are laying the ground work for more people, including citizens, to lose their rights if they cross an administration. Again, the government hasn't even been required to prove these people are illegal immigrants who are currently a part of the ONE gang the EO was written to cover. This is all ignoring that the law invoked to do this explicitly states that it's only to be used in response to invasion by another countries government OR war and gang members aren't representatives of a foreign government making the evocation of this law illegal by its own text.",
