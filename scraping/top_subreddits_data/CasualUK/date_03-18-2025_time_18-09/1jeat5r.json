    "selftext": "Currently writing a budget for a possible house move and want to make it as realistic as possible. Appreciate house maintenance costs can vary massively due to size, age, condition and location of a house, but wanted to get a feel for what people have actually spent over a long period (hence 10 years as some jobs such as replacing carpet/flooring we'll only probably do once in that time period). That way I can average out over to an annual cost.   \n\nAnd an idea of what you routinely do and/or pay someone to do would be useful too; such as annual boiler service, cleaning gutters that sort of thing.  \n\nAnd finally I'm not looking for costs related to 'big' home improvements like a new kitchen, new decking or an extension, I've got a separate budget line for that.  \n\nCheers!

That was around 5k.\nThen the washing machine died (\u00a3700 ish?), then we had to replace all the hinges in the windows, as well as having the balcony door frame removed, a tiny leak underneath fixed, and reset. The building insurance paid for that so can't remember, I think about 2k?\n\nThe boiler needed to have some parts replaced, there was a leak from a waste pipe and we had to replace the bathroom floor.\n\nI think in 7 years we have spent max 9k, some of it covered by insurance.",
