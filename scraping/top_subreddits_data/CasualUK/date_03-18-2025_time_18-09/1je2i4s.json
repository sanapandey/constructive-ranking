The dolphin, whilst a more svelte, cool sedentary blue and off-white in appearance\u2014perhaps anatomically more pleasing to the human gaze\u2014is simply flawed. This is largely due to the fact that its base circumference is limited by the dolphin\u2019s tail stock and flukes. Furthermore, the dolphin\u2019s characteristically famous 'bottle nose' is (like its namesake) only suited to 'bottleneck' the overall rubbish volume and demand required of it.\n\nFinally, we see why the dolphins meet their untimely demise and are thus driven to the outer fringes of indoor leisure pool areas and waterparks. The dolphin bin\u2019s sleek, streamlined shape, while elegant, renders it vulnerable to the whims of the wind\u2014its design ironically becomes its downfall, toppling it in gusty conditions and relegating it to sheltered indoor spaces or lesser waterparks. The frog, however, with its squat, sturdy form, triumphs in this area, standing resolute against the elements in simple, unyielding stability.",
