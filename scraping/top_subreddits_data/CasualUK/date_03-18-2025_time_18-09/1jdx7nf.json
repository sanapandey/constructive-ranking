There is a cylinder in the boiler called an expansion vessel that should be full of air to allow room for the expansion, but over time it can become flooded leaving no room for expansion.\n\nTo allow for this there is a pressure release valve which will release the pressure through an overflow pipe. If the PRV is used. Frequently then the passing water can score the valve allowing constant leakage.\n\nChecking the pressure of the expansion vessel is one of the reasons you should have your boiler serviced annually.",
