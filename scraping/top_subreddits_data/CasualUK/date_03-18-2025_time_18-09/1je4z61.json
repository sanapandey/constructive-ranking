I feel like there's an [Overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window)-esque rule for music, where there are public friendly and palatable versions of every genre but you can stray out of the realm of acceptable for playing over public speakers, and on those dance music days I feel like 6 Music strays out of what I'd consider to be in the Musical Overton Window. Maybe in the classic BBC tradition of balance they should have a day of rock and metal that falls outside the window of acceptability just to please me!",
