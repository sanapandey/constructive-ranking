I totally get why it blew you away, because it is spectacular. \n\nDurham\u2019s pillars were also quite influential, and you can see similar patterns at Lindisfarne Priory and Dunfermline Abbey. The spiral pattern was itself taken from St Peter\u2019s Basilica in Rome, so you can see it as a direct link between what was then the periphery of Christendom and its heart.",

It is easy to identify the different time periods by the size, color, and weathering of the stonework that make up the cathedral. The cathedral was started in 1072 but caught on fire in 1124. Only to be rebuilt and destroyed in 1185 by, of all things in Lincolnshire, an earthquake. Between the years 1192 and 1235, the cathedral was again rebuilt, alas they didn't have\u00a0[BIM](https://www.bricsys.com/bim/)\u00a0back in those days. The construction was somewhat experimental and so, just two years later, in 1237, the central Tower collapsed.\n\nAt this stage, you might think they'd give up, but no! In 1255 Henry III declared that the cathedral, once again, be rebuilt. In 1311 thanks to the wooden and lead spire on the central tower, Lincoln Cathedral became the tallest building in the world.\n\nFor 237 years the cathedral stood until disastrously, the central spire collapsed in 1548. If you consider how experimental the design was at the time, that's darn impressive. It is now a more modest 83 meters (272 ft).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1rabqhoh2gpe1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce6f3c9343d1ea18acbe9c7637353b9a1abd1451",

These were not just places of worship but also vital community hubs. Cathedrals and monastic institutions ran schools, provided medical care, offered shelter to the poor, and played a key role in preserving and spreading knowledge. Unlike secular wealth, which was often hoarded by the monarch and nobles, much of the wealth tied up in these buildings actively benefited society for centuries.\n\nThe real shift came with the Reformation. Henry VIII\u2019s dissolution of the monasteries stripped these religious institutions of their land, income, and ability to serve the public. What had once been centres of charity, education, and healthcare were left as oversized churches, many struggling for purpose in a world where their wider societal functions had been dismantled. In that sense, their decline wasn\u2019t due to their construction but to their later disempowerment.",
