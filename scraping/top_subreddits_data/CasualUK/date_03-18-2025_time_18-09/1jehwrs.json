They made a simple job i asked them todo 100000 times worse to fix it might mean breaking the item that needed fixing well it needed tighting with a tool i dont own but they do . They have fucked it up soo badly so Thursday morning will be spent attempting to take it apart completely to reinstall it correctly. Fucking hate men some days haha.\n\n\nSo on dog walk went in grab some chips and they kindly gave my doggo a sausage which is incredibly kind of them. So doggo is knackered as hes never been in the chippy so hes had a good day iv not because of the above but its fine. \n\n\nOh thumb is fucking painful as i tried to undo the above and now its painful so yay.",
