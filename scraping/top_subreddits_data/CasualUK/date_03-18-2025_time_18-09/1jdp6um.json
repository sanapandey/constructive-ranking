    "selftext": "My niece is 8, and yesterday she threw herself off a ladder without warning because she thought she heard a ghost. Trapped her right arm between the rungs and the handrail and has broken it despite an adult (my mum, her gran) being right behind her and stopping her from hitting the ground.\n\nToday, she went to school and found someone had locked a toilet cubicle and wriggled out under the door leaving it locked. She decided (with a broken arm, remember) to crawl in to unlock it. She got stuck and didn't have enough strength in her arms to push backwards. A friend was with her, but she was so embarrassed she swore the other girl to secrecy and made her leave. Took the teacher 20 minutes to realise she hadn't come back to class and find out where she was (hyperventilating on the floor, even more stuck). They phoned my sister 40 minutes after that as she was getting hysterical and the janitors were taking longer than expected to dismantle the cubicle and free her. Her back is all bruised and scratched up. She claims that if confronted by the same situation tomorrow, she has now learned to go butt first so if she gets stuck again she can still breathe OK. We were hoping for \"don't climb into/under small spaces\" but would have settled for \"get someone to find an adult immediately\". \n\nI'm supposed to be babysitting tomorrow night. Lord fucking help me. Was anyone else an extremely reckless child and survive? How much does a 10m roll of cotton wool cost these days? Do we just ask at the triage desk for an A&E loyalty card, or do you have to apply online? ",

Younger just casually said, \"I don't know, he fell out of the car back there\"",

She tripped,fell, banged her head AND dropped her ice-cream! Cue nearly 4hours in local A&E to be told nothing was broken. \n\"Don't run out here with your eyes shut. You'll run into something.\" Said by youngest big brother as she tore along the path outside our house. Yep, she ran face first into a tree. Bloodied and scraped her nose, scraped her forehead and dirtied her clothes. \nThat's just two of the many crazy things she's done. We've always nicknamed her Mad Madam Mim, after the Witch in Sword in the Stone because of her craziness. Oh, and despite all the mayhem, she's made it to the wonderful age of 30! \nAuntie, enjoy your niece, bad times and all. They grow up way to fast. L. X",

She wanted to stay, but sitting on a hard chair was too sore, so home to chill while her mum worked from home. \n\nJust after lunch, my sister got a call from the police to say a wallet my niece found on a family walk *months* ago, with no ID but \u00a350 cash inside, hadn't been claimed so it was theirs to collect. So she went with her mum to get it, and then immediately beelined for the retail park thry live near and got herself a massive Our Generation doll and a bunch of snacks.

Came in when it got too cold, watched Lilo and Stitch with top tier snacks (green Pringles, chocolate buttons, and marshmallows), I let her do my makeup, and right as I tucked her in with new doll beside her, told me she was the luckiest girl in the world.
