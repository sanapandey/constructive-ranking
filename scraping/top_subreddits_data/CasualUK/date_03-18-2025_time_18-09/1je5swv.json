Many things can be fixed by bending a paper clip for example, especially since they conduct electricity. I\u2019ve made shoe boxes into train stations with my son - I cut holes for the tracks to go through and he made signs and arranged the layout. Saves buying a \u00a330 Brio piece that he will lose interest in after a few years.\u00a0",
