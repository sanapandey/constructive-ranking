    "selftext": "Big weekend in Benidorm is approaching! I booked the flights ages ago and went for a 5am-ish one because it was a bit cheaper. The reality of that choice is now setting in. I live in a London suburb with bad night transport. I toyed with thoughts of sleep followed by a taxi to the airport but that would wipe out the money saved by booking the early flight (mugs game!)\n\nSo my options are...\n- Sleep at home, lime bike to Clapham Junction at 4am, train to Gatwick\n- Stay out all night! A band I like is playing a pub gig. I could enjoy the gig, drink in the pubs, catch a late night movie then early morning train to Gatwick.\n- Go to the gig then straight to Gatwick for a kip on the floor before the flight\n\nWhatever happens I'll be spending my taxi money on beer and arcade games in benidorm with no regrets! But interested to hear what you would do. ",

Going home in between, then risking an early train, just felt too much given the circumstances.\n\nYou can book the YotelAir for 6 or 7 hours instead of a full night and it's much cheaper, despite those 6 or 7 hours also being overnight. I paid \u00a3140 for two people but there are cheaper single rooms. Checked-in at 10pm after drinks in the airport Spoons (the lift down to the hotel is literally next to the pub), alarm was set for 4.30am, shower then check out at 5am and got the monorail thing to the other terminal. Perfect. Honestly, it transformed that early flight hell which is such a crap way to start a holiday.\n\nAlso the Yotel was so exciting to a dweeb like me who usually cuts corners to save money. Yes it's in a windowless basement but it's dark outside, who cares. The pods are like futuristic train compartments. The bed comes down from the wall with a remote control. TV, charging points and one of those all-in-one wet rooms with sink, shower and toilet. Everything you need, and super comfy with cosy bedding. It wasn't even noisy. Do it!",
