He rips the piss out of chefs for cooking Asian food all wrong, most notably Jamie Oliver.\n\nRadical Living - German guy that does funny videos (in English) stereotyping Germans and Berliners in particular\n\nBeard Meets Food - Yorkshireman going around the world doing eating challenges\n\nEd Chapman - another Yorkshireman, this one goes around the world being very sarcastic and funny\n \nEmma Cruises - she does cruise videos and most are on a reasonable budget that the average person can afford\n\nYellow Productions - American guy that does great travel videos, especially in Asia, with a lot of walking around and sampling local cuisine. He's a very pleasant kind of guy to watch.\n\nWalk With Me Tim - he used to do great UK coastal walks, he's now gone more into more luxury overseas travel but worth a watch for a UK take on certain destinations\n\nTrek Trendy - I like him for some sheer escapism into the world of insanely expensive first class travel, cruises and sleeper trains",

He bought a small boat a while back that he bought as a project so there's some stuff about that and more recently he bought a small canal boat too which is rather lovely. \n\nAlex Hefner's RV & Movie Vault - In sharp contrast to the calmness of the canals I do enjoy watching Alex's movie reaction videos. Be warned the guy has a very dirty mind. It's hilarious at times, borderline disturbing at others. So if you are sensitive to that maybe give it a miss but otherwise the videos are entertaining. \n\nArcade Matt - Plays claw and ticket machines in the arcades. \n\nBack In The Day (@officialbackintheday) - Talks about old TV shows that if you are of a certain age it will hit that nostalgia button. Some recent videos have been about The Krypton Factor, Stars In Their Eyes and Strike It Lucky. \n\nBenita Larsson - She's a minimalist and talks about simple living and just the general routines she has. It's all filmed and edited well IMO making the videos a little calm oasis in their own right. \n\nDaily Dose Of Internet - There are many, many channels that do compilations of interesting and/or funny clips but I like this one in particular as it's rarely nasty and doesn't typically show people doing \"funny\" things to animals that border on abuse as I often see in other compilations. There's also an interesting mix of funny and interesting clips. \n\nElsa Rhae & Barron - Living off grid on land they bought a couple of years ago and slowly built their own house. Prior to that they were living in a Scamp trailer off grid while they saved up the money to buy land. \n\nGone with the Wynns - A couple that have been sailing around the world, exploring the different islands. They are stuck on land right now due to issues with their new boat but their videography is very good and they are a likeable couple. \n\nHildegard von Blingin - Medieval style covers of popular songs. The woman's voice is heavenly. \n\nLGR - Probably more well know but he talks about old PCs, tech and retro PC games. He's also rather well known in the Sims community for his reliable reviews on the latest Sims expansions although he is pretty much over Sims 4. \n\nPushingUpRoses - I mainly watch the channel for her Murder, She Wrote retrospectives but she also sometimes talks about other shows like Goosebumps and Round The Twist.",
