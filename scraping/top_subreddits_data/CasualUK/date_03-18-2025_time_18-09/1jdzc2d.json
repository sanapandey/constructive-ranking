Did seem a little predictable so far but still interested in seeing more. So far it also reminds me quite a bit of **Maniac** on Netflix so I'd like to recommend that if you haven't seen that yet.\u00a0\n\n\n**The Matrix**. I'm sure I watched this not long after it came out but I didn't remember any of (apart from the famous bits). Thought it might have aged terribly,\u00a0 esp considering how much it's been satirised and lampooned but it's still brilliant. I loved it.

They're not shy about just killing people.\n\nThere's also an overarching mystery about who the protagonist's father is which they've so far dragged on for four seasons and it's starting to get old.\n\nI'm not painting it in the best light but in the vein of crime procedurals like Law & Order, Chicago PD and so on I would say it holds its own",

I usually avoid hyped-up shows at the time but end up watching them years later (only saw Squid Games last year), but I think I'll give it a watch. Stephen Graham is always fantastic.",
