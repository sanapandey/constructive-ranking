I knew that prior to our relationship he struggled with money issues, and it is a huge trigger for him.\n\nSo what did I manage to do? Take over the bills a couple years ago and Completely fucked it up. Credit card debt, juggling zero interest cards, all that jazz. My credit has been on a slow and steady decline. I\u2019ve been trying to keep things out of his name so his credit is ok.\n\nI have so much guilt and shame. I was so stupid to let it happen. I used shopping, expensive hobbies, and poor poor financial habits as a way to cover up my anxiety and depression. I lost my mom, we\u2019ve had a lot of medical debt, travel for my mom and medical reasons, etc. None of those things are excuses for lying to him though.\n\nI am so overwhelmed and Guilty. He has no idea.\n\nOn Friday we are going to sit down to review finances while our kids are at school and I am going to come clean. I have no idea how he is going to react. It might be bad (hi divorce), but even best case scenario he is never going to trust me again. And I don\u2019t deserve his trust.\n\nHe didn\u2019t deserve any of this. I have totally betrayed his trust and it keeps me up at night.\n\nPart of me is ready to come clean and be honest. The other, cowardly part of me wants to keep up the charade. I\u2019m finally going to be brave and be honest.\n\nI feel sick.\n\n***Top Comments:***\n\n**TheFinalPhilter:** \"he struggled with money issues\" It sounds like you both struggle with money issues.\n\n**MalrykZenden:** The slow crawl into crippling debt is easier to do then some people realize. Corporations restructure and file bankruptcy all the time, there's no shame in it, just learn from it. You can file bankruptcy just for yourself, and if the majority if not all the debt is in your name, it won't effect your spouse. I'd suggest coming clean after speaking with a bankruptcy attorney, there's a way out of this and only you have the pay the price, not your spouse. I did this a couple years ago, my wife's credit was untouched, and mine is already back up to just under 700. Be honest, be strong, do what the attorney says to protect any assets you do not wish to liquidate, and the next thing you know it'll be a bad memory. Most importantly, do NOT do it again.\n\n>**Gimperina:** I second this. When my business collapsed during the financial crash of 2008, I had no income and a big mortgage. Long story short I got into about \u00a330k of debt. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat and I couldn't think straight due to the stress.  \nI had a meeting with my accountant and she advised bankruptcy, and explained all the benefits of bankruptcy to me. I went ahead with it and breathed a huge sigh of relief. No regrets whatsoever.\n\n**CHEDDERFROMTHEBLOCK2:** I've been on the other side of this situation. My husband (we aren't married but been together for damn near 16yrs) wanted to take over bills even though I am great with budgeting and money. Everything was in his name. Every so often I'd ask about our finances cause things started not making sense or I'd see a bill (he'd hide em) that was past due. It would immediately turn into 0-100 tantrum with him. It was a tactic he'd use to shut me down soon as I asked. I would ask nicely to sit down and come up with a plan if I could just see the bills and what is going on. We never had and he tanked us including my own credit because we had each other on our both our cards. I still haven't really forgave him. We lost the ability to buy the house we rented for 15yrs that our special needs children grew up in (which was set up for them and their future as adults having a small apartment upstairs) and had to buy a tiny house with neighbors smashed against us, hardly a yard and I'm miserable as fuck. I feel like I lost a person I loved deeply loosing that home. We're still together and I handle all the bills now, house is in my name...I'm waiting to win the lottery now to escape what he's done to us. I resent him , lost any attraction or respect for him. I'd walk away if I could.\n\n**redditaddict123456:** Coming clean will be a huge weight lifted\n\nAnd maybe now the two of you can communicate better and work through this together\n\nOr he may never trust you again, but you owe him the truth\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1j7xuap/update_in_five_days_im_coming_clean_and_it_will/)**: March 10, 2025 (8 days later)**\n\nTl dr; My marriage isn\u2019t over, but I don\u2019t think it will ever be the same.\n\nFirst, thank you to everyone that replied and messaged. I read every single one. I appreciated the hopeful comments and identified with the harsh ones. I\u2019m no angel in this story.\n\nSo some extra info - my husband has a very high intensity job, and travels frequently. I took over the bills so nothing would get lost in the shuffle when he was away from home and he could focus on what he needed to focus on. (Insert joke here, right).\n\nI wad a complete wreck last week. I barely slept, was physically anxious, and was both absolutely dreading Friday but also couldn\u2019t wait for it to just get here already. Fortunately my husband was on a work trip and my kids were busy with basketball, friends, theatre, etc and were barely home. I barely ate and lost like 3 lbs that I\u2019ve been stuck on. Not recommended for a diet plan.\n\nFriday we planned to each work a half day then have some lunch and look at our budget for the year. Tax returns were pretty decent and my husband got a good annual bonus, so it made sense to see what was what. He was already talking about throwing some in a CD or investment and I just felt ill.\n\nFriday comes and he comes home with In\u2019n\u2019Out and a chocolate shake for me and I just \u2026 lost it. Full on sobbing. It freaked the hell out of him, and took me like ten minutes to get myself under control. Then I spilled it all. I started with \u201cI love you and I\u2019m sorry\u201d and just let fly. That wasn\u2019t my plan, I had a whole thing written down to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything and it didn\u2019t matter at all.\n\nTo his incredible credit he just sat there in shock and listened. Then he definitely under-reacted and went directly to \u201cwe\u2019ll fix it together\u201d mode. He wanted some time to absorb what I\u2019d said and then wanted to work through our accounts one by one to see what was actually up, and he wanted to do this alone, then we\u2019d come up with a plan.\n\nI let him be and just did some cleaning and laundry. After maybe 45 minutes I heard him leave the house with a door slam. I wasn\u2019t about to chase him down after he asked for space to process. I did look at the computer and it was a list of all our outstanding balances.\n\nTo everyone guessing figures, here you go:\n\nI assumed it would be 60k based on my rough math, but I had forgotten a couple I had on autopay.\n\n$96,000 in debt that he had no idea about.\n\nHe messaged me a while later that he was going to stay by his mom for the night and would be back to pack a bag, and that he would rather not talk yet. I respected that and made myself scarce.\n\nHe came home the next day and we manufactured some time alone to talk by sending the kids out to run errands. The oldest can drive and loves any excuse.\n\nThe heart to heart was basically this - I fucked up royally here, but he shouldn\u2019t have checked out completely and let it get to this point. He is going to take over our finances. We\u2019re going to do a HELOC or second mortgage for all the recurring stuff and buckle down HARD. We will review everything together at least twice a month. We will do marriage counseling together.\n\nI agreed to absolutely every term and condition. I honestly thought he wasn\u2019t going to come back. Things are chilly at best right now, and I am so desperately sorry and sick over the hurt I caused. At the same time there is a deep sense of relief that, whatever happens, I\u2019m no longer lying about it and everything is out in the open.\n\nMaybe he\u2019ll still decide that he can\u2019t move on, but I\u2019m going to own whatever happens.\n\n***OOP's Comment:***\n\nCommenter: \"The heart to heart was basically this - I fucked up royally here, but he shouldn\u2019t have checked out completely and let it get to this point\" Nah you\u2019re not gonna blame him for not paying attention\u00a0\n\n>**OOP:** Those were his words. The blame is on me here, I feel like I\u2019ve been pretty transparent about that. This is where he landed on it\n\n***Top Comments:***\n\n**Taylor5:** The best solution to solving this together is full transparency and showing that you are committed is to actively attacking this debt, so if you don't currently work, get a job.\n\nAlso, don't know if you can do it in your country but in mine I can link banking apps to send notifications whenever there is a transaction, you can set it up to go to you both, so you both can monitor each other. This is a joint situation, and will build back trust.\n\nBut 96k, wow, do you even have anything to show for that? How did you manage to keep getting credit. That's insane.\n\n**zombiepants7:** OP you also probably should look into therapy or a shopping addiction group. Almost 100 grand in debt is like gambling addiction levels of having a problem. Good luck though hope you two work it out and find a way forward. You might consider picking up some additional income to work down the debt\n\n>**stepapparent:** Agreed. I did this a few years ago and am still fighting the urges that go along with it. There is a deeper problem to solve. I\u2019ve tried several therapists but a group would be awesome I just have a hard time finding anything near me or online.\n\n**lung1:** Had this scenario happen to a co worker. He called me and asked for advice and beer. He ended talking an equity loan on the house to pay off the outstanding debt. She wasn\u2019t sorry because it was all for the kids.(Disney vacations, designer clothes) He was under the impression that she was paying all of this with her baby sitting money.? It was definitely a mess.\n\n>**Odd\\_Welcome7940:** \"She wasn't sorry\"  \nThat is where the beginning of the end happened hopefully. At least in the case of OP she seems to have real remorse. I can forgive someone who isn't making excuses but delusional people who think they can just spend whatever they like? Nope\n\n**sffood:** No way to tell if your marriage will survive this, but in your coming clean, that burden was transferred to him. How much lighter you feel is\u00a0*because*\u00a0the weight is now on him. Don\u2019t forget that.\n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d run out and get any additional job I can, even a minimum wage job, and contribute to paying it back. He may not want you to, but offer and make a real effort.\n\nWhen you say \u201cexpensive hobbies,\u201d I hope you don\u2019t mean gambling. I\u2019d be completely unforgiving if it was spent on gambling, but otherwise, it\u2019s disappointing but not unforgivable in my mind. People do stupid shit all the time.\n\nBut your actions have put your whole family behind for the next X years. I\u2019d go out of my way to never eat out, and downgrade all necessities. Like if you are used to La Prairie moisturizer, use f\\*cking Neutrogena. Clip coupons when grocery shopping and tighten up everything, and waste nothing.\n\nThat\u2019s your penance.\n\nHe seems to love you, and if he sees all this for the next year or few years, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d find it in his heart to forgive you. You\u2019d probably develop a few good habits too. You have to earn that forgiveness before you can earn trust back, though I\u2019d never expect to earn trust around finances back in this lifetime.\n\nI\u2019m glad you told him the truth.",

Lots of people enjoy casual gambling without becoming addicted or suffering adverse consequences. I 100% agree that gambling addiction is devastating and awful (and absolutely has no place in youth sports). So is alcoholism, and our culture celebrates alcohol consumption, to our overall detriment, but the U.S.'s attempt at prohibition pretty famously didn't fix that. Pushing an activity underground just makes people sneakier (and less likely to ask for help when they need it). Many European countries have had (highly regulated) legal gambling for decades. Public health interventions like education, destigmatization, and expansion of treatment programs are going to become very important in the US as gambling is more easily accessible. (My partner is a former professional poker player who now works in a gambling-adjacent field, so this is a topic that is often discussed at our house.)",

Cash back (anywhere from 1-5% and occasionally 10% on certain categories) has been a truly amazing thing.  I use credit cards for literally everything that I can (was so awesome to pay rent with a CC and get those points!) but with a mortgage, it has to be an actual banking account.  But like food, bills, fun stuff, everything else, I use a CC.  And I have 3 in rotation, 4 total.  Each one has different perks for different things throughout the year so I just cycle and use them accordingly.  My best one yet is a Wells Fargo one which has 2% cash back on every purchase with no limits and no annual fees.  HECK. YEAH.  I have a Chase card with 3% cash back on restaurants, also unlimited and no annual fee. And there are cards that have 5% cash back in revolving categories quarterly.  I always choose cards with no fee (because seriously that's just lame) and I always pay the card on time so I never pay interest.  I'm not even sure what my interest rates are but I imagine somewhere in the 25-30% category.  Never worry about it though.  So, I guess in short summary to your question, it's not always about spending money you don't have.  I make sure I have the actual money, pay with credit, and pay the credit bill WHILE getting free money back.  Last year Discover had a guaranteed match where they basically doubled the cash back at the end of your year.  At the end of that year, I had an extra $1100 to put in my bank account, totally free.  It. Was. Awesome.",

My husband (we aren't married but been together for damn near 16yrs) wanted to take over bills even though I am great with budgeting and money. Everything was in his name. Every so often I'd ask about our finances cause things started not making sense or I'd see a bill (he'd hide em) that was past due. It would immediately turn into 0-100 tantrum with him. It was a tactic he'd use to shut me down soon as I asked. I would ask nicely to sit down and come up with a plan if I could just see the bills and what is going on. We never had and he tanked us including my own credit because we had each other on our both our cards. I still haven't really forgave him. We lost the ability to buy the house we rented for 15yrs that our special needs children grew up in (which was set up for them and their future as adults having a small apartment upstairs) and had to buy a tiny house with neighbors smashed against us, hardly a yard and I'm miserable as fuck. I feel like I lost a person I loved deeply loosing that home. We're still together and I handle all the bills now, house is in my name...I'm waiting to win the lottery now to escape what he's done to us. I resent him , lost any attraction or respect for him. I'd walk away if I could.\n\nThis OOP needs to divorce him, he ruined their lives and seething for the rest of their life is no way to live. \n\nAnd this is a good lesson to everyone else, never let one spouse handle all the money. Even when everything is going great, both partners need to be involved in all areas of their finances.",

Because by the time I'd pay my electric bill on the 28th of the month, my car insurance is due again on the 2nd. And if you miss any of them then that's a $30+ late fee you're forking over for no reason. And it's not even consistent for each bill, because my phone and internet bills always seem to be on different days of the month each month. So it's not as simple as remembering that it's the 11th so I need to pay my phone bill. \n\nYes, I could put all of those dates on my calendar and set the consistent ones to repeat monthly and manually enter the next due date for the inconsistent ones every month. Or I could take 10 minutes to set them all up to autopay and then never think of them again. \n\nThere is literally zero benefits to manually paying your bills if you can afford them. The only benefit to not automating them is if you're broke and you need to play the rotating delinquency game to choose which bill will hurt you the least if you don't pay it this month.",
