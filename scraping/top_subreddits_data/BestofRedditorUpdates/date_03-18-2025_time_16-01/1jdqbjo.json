OOP is u/TartLimp3997\u00a0\n\nOriginally posted to r/Ratschlag\u00a0\n\n**Posts were translated from German to English.**\n\n[Ex-Girlfriend is now my boss at my new job, how to handle it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ratschlag/comments/1j1rf4o/exfreundin_ist_nun_meine_vorgesetze_auf_meiner/) March 2, 2025\n\nI\u2019ll try to keep this as short as possible:\n\nMy now ex-girlfriend broke up with me out of nowhere two months ago after 2.5 years together and moved back to her hometown (same state). After that, I applied for the job she used to have (a position at the local hardware store for an external company that handles shelf maintenance) because I was unemployed at the time and needed a job quickly. I got the job, and that\u2019s when I found out that she has now been promoted to regional manager (since the previous one left).\n\nNow, on Monday, I have my first day of work, and she along with another regional manager will be training me (tomorrow and Tuesday). Ever since I found out, I\u2019ve been dreading tomorrow. Since last night, I\u2019ve had terrible stomach cramps and nausea because I have no idea how to handle this situation, and I\u2019m realizing that I\u2019m still not over her.\n\nWhat should I do? How can I handle this situation better?\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ratschlag/comments/1j2pnpc/update_zu_exfreundin_ist_nun_vorgesetzte/) March 3, 2025\n\nHello Community, there is an update on my post from yesterday, but first, I want to say this: I really want to thank everyone who gave me advice, encouraged me, or simply shared their opinion. I couldn\u2019t respond to the comments due to the sheer number and lack of time, which some people even pointed out in private messages, but I read every single one and was able to take some of the advice to heart.\n\nNow for the actual update:\n\nI went in and just focused on learning everything first. The regional manager made a really good impression on me right away, and that impression only got better throughout the day. I started at 07:30, and around 9, he mentioned that he had to go to the train station soon. At that moment, I knew exactly what he meant, he was going to pick up my ex. He must have noticed my reaction because he immediately followed up by saying that he wanted to ask me something a bit more personal:\n\nNamely, what kind of relationship I had with her. I was completely honest and told him that she was my ex-girlfriend. He then asked if that was going to be a problem for me. I took a moment to think and then said, if I\u2019m being honest, which he immediately encouraged, yes, it is a problem for me. It\u2019s still very fresh, and I\u2019m absolutely not over it yet.\n\nHe reassured me that this wasn\u2019t an issue at all, he had sensed that there was something between us but didn\u2019t know exactly what, which is why he wanted to ask. He then said he would simply assign her to a completely different department so that we barely have to interact and that we should just try to make the best of the situation.\n\nAs it turns out, it\u2019s not even certain that she\u2019ll get the position. For now, she\u2019s just attending a coaching/training session today and tomorrow. On top of that, it seems like the regions for managers will be significantly reduced because they will also be taking on a floating role within the company. This means that even if she does get the job, there\u2019s a good chance she\u2019ll be assigned to a completely different region due to the distance.\n\nI\u2019m feeling a lot better now, and I just want to thank all of you again for reading and commenting!\n\n**Reminder - this is a repost.

And I don't think the OOPs expression alone was sufficient for him to know something was up. Most people aren't that observant. She must have made a facial expression or two as well when OOPs name was brought up. \n\nKinda reminds me of an interview I had. I recognized someone on the interview committee but could not recall. I felt that it was OBVIOUS that I kept sneaking peeks at him (especially since we were the only people of color in the room) but I was trying to remember how I knew him. \nI remember thinking, \"Did I sleep with him??? Shit, that's gonna be AWKWARD AF if I get this job.\" \n\nLater that week I went to my second job... Yeah, he worked there at the faculty help desk. \ud83d\ude02 Always said hi, but never really spoke until that day. He remembered me from the interview.",

So it kinda makes sense that they're a bit desperate to find someone to work there. OOP also mentioned in another post that the ex was talking favorably about him with someone higher up, so at least we know that she is fine with it (and doesn't feel stalked).                \n\nA small reminder that a state in Germany is not that big. A train ride away is not that big of a deal there, but most people also favor public transport for work depending on where they live. \"Rush hour\" traffic jams are super common in some cases and it can be cheaper and faster to use trains. We have train stops every 5-10 minutes usually and a really good network (with bus stations and subways combined), so it does make a lot of sense that most people do not have cars or prefer to use public transport. So I'm strongly assuming that the hardware store is a bit out of reach for  usual public transport (they can be a bit further away because no one would shop there \"by foot\" unless you need something small) and that OP has a car or other means to get there quickly OR that the previously shared home is rather nearby and the store is easy to reach (which would explain why the ex had no issue to get there when she was working there, but now has to be picked up from the station). And this can have a great impact on the candidate choice because it's rather convenient to have someone that could reach the store rather easily compared to someone who has to take a train there and needs to be picked up apparently :D                \n\nSo all in all it seems reasonable to me that they actually want him to work there and not just because he is a man as others suggested >\\_>",

Now the boss asks about their relationship - I'm maybe guessing because he saw them together when the girlfriend still worked there (picking her up etc) and the boss, knowing girlfriend is only in town for two days decided to avoid awkwardness all round and have ex work in a different department, sparing everyone any awkwardness. If anything I'd call it some good managing to avoid a potential embarrassing situation for both employees.",

Not just left, but left the city, that's a literal train ride away. That's quite a distance to go. He claims it was \"out of nowhere\", but really, how many BORUs have we seen where that exact phrasing is used by guys who then trickle-truth that they were neglectful, lazy, inconsiderate, or truly heinous in comments/updates? There's some [walkaway wife syndrome](https://www.marriage.com/advice/mental-health/signs-of-walkaway-wife-syndrome/) vibes to a \"she left for no reason\" excuse.\n\n\n2. The guy admits he was unemployed when she left. Well, how long was he unemployed during their relationship?\n\n\n3. He specifically goes and applies for a job she used to have, which...idk. Who does that? Seriously, who is so bereft of options or ambition that they go \"welp guess I'll apply to my ex's workplace\".\n\n\n4. He's obviously so wound up and stressed out about being managed by her \u2013 does he think she's going to treat him poorly? Why, if she, as he claimed, left for no reason at all? \u2013 that he whines to the current regional manager about it.  Which, again, begs the question of *why did he apply in the first place if he thought there might be a chance to see her again?*\n\n\n5. This manager, another man, then *takes the word of a guy who's been employed for less than 24 hours* and assures him the ex, the actual long-time employee who worked hard and was promoted, might actually not get the job after all. All because this one lone guy threw a pity party for himself about a breakup that has nothing to do with the business? Who tf does that??\n\n\n\nIt's just weird and seems like OOP's got a lot of missing reasons stuffed in his pockets.\n\n\n\nETA 2.0:\n\nAccording to OOP they [lived with his parents](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/s/9fHzwV3rDH) for the majority of the relationship. She wanted to move out, they couldn't as he lost his job & was then hospitalized for a month-ish at the end of last year. She got into contact with an ex at that time, and after OP got out she told him she wasn't sure about them (her & OP). Thus, breakup.\n\nOOP does know why. I feel a bit more sympathy for him, but *man.* Seems she wanted their relationship to move forward.",

Not entirely at least. Everything between us was quite Harmonic. The only issue was that we lived in the same house as my parents for 2 years (own apartment in the house).

It could've been the work Christmas party, it could've been him picking her up from work, it could've been out at the local shops while they were grocery shopping.  She also likely may have shown pictures of things like vacations that might've included him in the pictures.\n\nAnd people talk.  The regional manager may not have known you personally but he may know someone you worked with or who interviewed you for the position.\n\nThe whole thing seems a little weird because she moved so far away but kept working for the same company.... the OOP makes it sound like there was nothing wrong with the relationship but I can nearly guarantee that she vented to her work mates about what might've been happening (doesn't mean it was anything big but it may be a lot of little things that added up).  So they may actually be a bit wary of him.  And the way the OOP brushes off the ex.. 'She might not even get the job.'  Perhaps he might need to be a bit more worried as he'd still be in the probationary period where he can be let go at any point.",
