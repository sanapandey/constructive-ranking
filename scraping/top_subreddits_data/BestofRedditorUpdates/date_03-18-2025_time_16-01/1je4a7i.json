I used to visit them often before I was married, but even now we try to visit each other once a month and are generally on cordial terms. During dinner my SIL made a remark about my wife's bag that I had bought for our anniversary. My wife seemed happy about that and everything was going well. My SIL then compared it to my wallet, which is pretty old and worn (but I like it because my dad gave it to me 11 years ago when I left for college), and told my wife she should make me shop for myself too. I said I liked my wallet (I've heard comments about it and I just laugh it off). She then said something that basically translates to \"One person earns and another person spends\"\n\nI felt uncomfortable about it but my wife looked totally pissed off. I tried to change the topic but my wife said she takes care of our son, maintains our house while I work, decorated our house from scratch (all true, and I routinely thank her for it). My SIL said it was a joke, but within a few minutes my wife just said she wasn't feeling well and we went back. During the drive back and when we came back home, she made it very clear that she won't be keeping any contact with her until she gets a clear apology.\n\nToday, my brother called and suggested we grab a bite to eat. I said sure. The way he said it, it really seemed like it was just the two of us. My wife also had no issues with that. I thought my brother was going to discuss a way for us to meet or something so my SIL and my wife could patch things up. When I went there my SIL was there too. While we were eating they gave me her POV, that it was a light-hearted comment and my wife was blowing it out of proportion. I defended my wife too, and said she definitely feels it was out of line.\n\nWhen I came back home and my wife learned she was there too, she got really upset. She said if my SIL wasn't prepared to render an apology then I should've left, and that I betrayed her by having food with them. I don't see it that way, I was really trying to fix everything in good faith. AITA?\n\n**Top Comments:**\n\n**Comment 1:**  \nINFO: did you say that YOU thought her comment was out of line or only that your wife thought so? Did you say that she owes your wife an apology?\n\n**OP replies:**  \nI did tell her she shouldn't have said that, she said she didn't mean it in the way my wife thinks, but I did tell her she should apologize as my wife was hurt by her comment, that her feelings were valid, and that's the only way this issue could be put to rest.\n\n**Comment 2:**  \nESH\n\nWhat are you all? Twelve?\n\n**Op replies:**  \nI totally agree. This has all been dragged out so much it's exhausting.\n\n**Comment 3:**  \nINFO:\n\nwhat kind of relationship does your wife and SIL have?\n\nI can see why your SIL thinks it was lighthearted and silly. I can also see why your wife may not have thought so. the relationship dynamic will dictate the answer.\n\nfor the record, if my SIL said something like that to me, I'd laugh and move on. If any other person did, I may take offense to the implication that I'm a spendthrift.\n\n**OP replies:**  \nThey don't really have a 1-1 relationship of their own I'd say, like I don't know if the two of them have ever hung out by themselves.\n\n**Comment 4:**  \nQuestion\u2026 Does your sister-in-law work or is she a stay at home mom? Could this be jealousy?\n\n**Op replies:**  \nMy SIL works.\n\n**Comment 5:**  \nYTA\n\nI know that you just want to brush it off because it\u2019s easier to you, but your SIL was deliberately mean-spirited (implying your wife is a leech or a gold digger) and trying to laugh it off as \u201cjust a joke, why are you so sensitive\u201d plus inviting you out without your wife to talk about your wife is really not ok. You say you defended your wife, did you also demand an apology? Did you ask why they wanted to meet with you instead of your wife? Even the non-apology of \u201cjust a light hearted comment\u201d should have been directed to your wife directly not via you.\n\nYes, this will impact your relationship with your brother going forward, but just pretending it didn\u2019t happen isn\u2019t an option, and hopefully you made it clear to SIL that it is on her to fix this, not on your wife to forgive and forget (without even an apology!).\n\n**Op replies:**  \nYes, I had insisted on an apology and told her that was the only way to move past it. I tried to convince her to call my wife and apologize. I failed in that effort.\n\nOnce it was clear that she wasn't going to, I should've left. I messed up there. I have apologized to my wife about that and she has forgiven me. I am on her side 100% the remark was out of line and my wife is completely right to demand an apology as a pre-requisite for moving on from this. We will not be able to meet with her, until that happens because my SIL is being unreasonable about this.\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/LpMyWpSz2E):\u00a0**March 11, 2025 (three days later)**\n\nI realized that I didn't advocate for my wife to the extent that I should have. I told my brother we wouldn't be able to have these family meetups until this was resolved.\n\nYesterday, my SIL had sent me one of those funny relatable memes. While it did get a laugh out of me, I told my SIL that we (my wife and I) can't have any communication with her until she apologizes to my wife. She asked me if my wife was still upset over it, I said yes, and that it was understandable because what she had said was distasteful. I also said I was very surprised at how unreasonable she was being, that apologizing won't make anyone think less of her, that I've already told her now how she can fix this, that the ball is in her court, and ended our chat.\n\nToday my SIL told me she had apologized to my wife. I thanked her for it. When I got home, I asked my wife about it. She said she had apologized. I thought that was that, but my wife said she still won't be meeting her anymore, that her apology wasn't sincere, that the bell couldn't be unrung. I was frustrated because the apology for the stupid joke had finally come through, and this issue was still not over. I asked my wife what she wants, she said she won't be meeting them until she feels comfortable. But we were meeting them before this happened, so the only issue was what happened that day, for which we've received an apology. But she was adamant that she was done with them. I will have to navigate through this issue, and what this means for my relationship with my brother and SIL.\n\n**Comment 1:**  \nDo you not like your wife?! You said you should have advocated for her more but now you want her to go back to hanging around someone who made a degrading remark about her?! It wasn\u2019t a thought less remark. Your SIL has probably thought that for a long time to be brave enough to say it to your wife. Homemakers always get degraded because they have no income but you save on childcare, house cleaning, laundry service and eating out if she cooks dinners. He contributes probably save as much as her salary would make.\n\n**Op replies:**  \nNo, if she actually thinks my SIL is generally hostile to her, we'll both stop seeing her. It's just that this whole thing started over the remark, my wife said it's an apology that she wants, I worked towards getting her that apology, and now I'm being told there's just a general dislike whicj was never brought up. The lack of communication is what's frustrating. Like we normally see them only once or twice a month now so its fine but if there was a problem in general I could've been on her side better earlier.\n\n**Comment 2:**  \nyeah, I mean, I wouldn't, either. your sil revealed her true feelings about your wife and also revealed herself to be a catty bully. I wouldn't want to hang out with her again, either, even after a fake forced apology. the fact that you're still pushing your wife to hang out with her even when she's hurt and uncomfortable is nasty.\n\n**Op replies:**  \nI'm not going to push her to hang out. If she's uncomfortable, that's that.\n\n**Comment 3:**  \nIt was a distasteful comment that your SIL has since apologized for. Unless she has a history of making these comments, your wife is being ridiculous.\n\n**Op replies:**  \nShe doesn't, it was a one-off remark. I can understand why my wife was upset when she said it though.\n\n**Comment 4:**  \nWell she\u2019s since made numerous one-off remarks minimizing your wife. So she now has a habit of this and from what your wife told you she\u2019s been mean to her. You may have used your selective hearing though when she said it because you seem to really care about your SIL. More than your wife.\n\n**Op replies:**  \nYou have insinuated multiple times that I care more for my SIL than I do for my wife. Nothing could be further from the truth. My wife is the love of my life. She never told me that she perceived a general hostility from my SIL. If she had I would've either fixed it or followed my wife's lead in avoiding my SIL altogether. But this started after my SIL's recent remark. And until I got the apology, she said she just wanted an apology, which I worked to get her because I wanted her to feel better.\n\nI will admit that I would prefer if there were a way for us to get over this because my parents and my older sister don't have a great relationship with my brother and SIL so I don't want them to lose me and my wife as family too. Also, my brother and I live much closer to each other than the rest of our family so for smaller family holidays (not Christmas or Thanksgiving) we've been doing it together. I'm sorry if I sound pointed but your insinuation is rife with assumptions and quite hurtful.\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs \u2013 BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**",

IMO if SIL had dropped a \"sorry I upset you\" type apology but had amended her behaviour and stopped making snarky remarks then that's good enough. You can't demand genuine contrition from someone but you can demand a change in their behaviour.\u00a0\u00a0",

A good apology requires acknowledging specifically what you did, *why* you now understand it was wrong and an effective promise that it will never happen again. It's easy to spot if someone's being insincere, and you should never have to accept one that is.\n\n\nI guarantee SIL apologised by saying something like \"I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings\" or the even less accountable \"I'm sorry if your feelings *were hurt*\". I guarantee she didn't apologise for what she specifically said, didn't apologise for effectively calling OOP's wife a gold digger, and still tried to play down what she did.\u00a0\n\n\nFuck anyone who's saying the wife is overreacting or \"shifting the goalposts\" because she *technically* got an apology. If someone dislikes you so much that they'd make a \"joke\" like that, refuse to apologise for several days, and then when they finally do they clearly don't mean it and don't understand why they were wrong, why would you want to be around them? Even with accepting a sincere apology, it doesn't mean everything just goes back to how it was before. You're still perfectly within your rights to avoid someone for the disrespect they showed you, even if they are truly remorseful.\u00a0\n\n\nEdit:\n\n\n>my parents and my older sister don't have a great relationship with my brother and SIL\n\n\nHuh, wonder why that could be.

He doesn\u2019t seem to also be fairly viewing things, as he seems to think the act of saying sorry is sufficient. Worst of all, he is selfish to just think that the words \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 are enough, regardless of whether they were said or intended insincerely.
