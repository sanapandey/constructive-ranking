OOP is u/DangerousCalendar960\n\nOriginally posted to r/Ratschlag\n\nTrigger warnings: >!abortion, workplace harasssment!<\n\n**Posts were translated from German to English.**\n\n[Coworker shares private information about me in a meeting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ratschlag/comments/1flato3/kollegin_erz%C3%A4hlt_private_dinge_%C3%BCber_mich_im/) September 20, 2024\n\nHey everyone, I (F, 27) really need your advice on how to handle this situation.\n\nI work an office job, and next to me sits the executive assistant (F, 61). We don\u2019t get along well because she treats me like her daughter. I notice it every time it happens and ask her to stop, but she doesn\u2019t.\n\nToday, we were in a tense meeting discussing a sensitive topic for the company, the atmosphere was already strained among the eight participants. At some point, our boss suggested taking a break or calling it a day, I agreed that ending the meeting might be the better option. The assistant then looked at me weirdly and, in a very aggressive tone, said, \"Well, you sure know a lot about terminations.\"\n\nThere was a brief, awkward silence before she immediately added, \"Because she had an abortion.\"\n\nI was completely stunned and had no idea how to react. My colleagues were just as shocked. I just wished everyone a nice weekend, left the room, and went home early.\n\nIt\u2019s true that I had an abortion this year, but I have no idea how she found out. Only two people in my life know about it, and she doesn\u2019t know either of them.\n\nRegardless, I find it absolutely unacceptable to bring something like that up - especially in a professional setting, whether it\u2019s relevant to the discussion or not.\n\nNow I\u2019m wondering what steps I can take. We don\u2019t have a workers\u2019 council, our \"HR\" representative is based at another location and is currently on extended sick leave. Our boss sees \"these kinds of conflicts\" as personal issues that should be resolved between the individuals involved.\n\nI plan to confront the assistant on Monday.\n\nCould there be (legal) consequences for her, or do I just have to accept this and move on?\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate any advice, thanks in advance!\n\n**Update** (same post, same day)\n\nI have an appointment with a lawyer first thing Monday morning. Since we only need a sick note from the 3rd day of absence, I\u2019ll be calling in sick on Monday and discussing the next steps with the lawyer.\n\nI\u2019ve also found the contact details of the data protection officer at the clinic, but I\u2019ll wait until after my lawyer appointment to proceed with that.\n\nI really appreciate all of your support! The idea that sensitive data might have been leaked from the clinic didn\u2019t occur to me on my own, and I hadn\u2019t even considered it before. You\u2019ve all opened up a lot of options for me that I\u2019ll discuss with the lawyer on Monday. Thank you for that!\n\nUPDATE: First of all, thank you for all the helpful responses, I\u2019ll try to reply to as many as I can!\n\nAfter a thorough search online, I found out that the partner of the boss\u2019s son actually works at the clinic where I had the procedure. I strongly suspect that this is how the assistant got hold of the information, as she regularly attends family events and birthdays of the boss\u2019s family.\n\nThis seems to be the most likely explanation for how she found out.\n\n**Update** (same post) September 26, 2024\n\nHello everyone, here\u2019s the promised update :)\n\nOn Monday, I had a meeting with a lawyer, and it was definitely worth it. During the meeting with the lawyer, my boss called me and asked me to come to the office for a clarifying conversation. After discussing with my lawyer, I went to the office to have the conversation. The assistant greeted me in tears and insisted that it \"wasn't meant like that.\" I took my favorite colleague with me as a witness/support, and we entered the meeting. Given the sensitive nature of the topic, I asked for minutes to be taken, which everyone agreed to.\n\nIn the conversation, my boss explained that such behavior between colleagues would not be tolerated, and the assistant had to apologize and promise that it wouldn\u2019t happen again. I then asked what consequences would follow, to which he seemed confused and asked if I even wanted consequences, since an apology was given.\n\nNaturally, I demanded consequences for the assistant and clarification about the data leak. I also told the boss that it was outrageous that he was asking if I wanted consequences instead of implementing them himself, especially when it comes to something as sensitive as spreading private information. He became a bit grumpy but explained that it wasn\u2019t a data leak and that he had just \"slipped up.\" When I asked where he got this information from, he bluntly admitted that he had learned about it through his daughter in law. He even followed up with, \"But you couldn\u2019t even tell you had the procedure.\"\n\nI seriously thought I was going to flip out in that room, but fortunately, I managed to stay composed. I asked for confirmation of his statements to make sure everything was understood correctly, and then had everyone sign the protocol. I got up, wished everyone a nice day, and informed him that my lawyer would be contacting him, and we\u2019d go from there.\n\nOne of the six colleagues who was in the meeting on Friday approached me afterward, apologized for not saying anything in the moment, and wished me luck, strength, and that someone would react better than he did if something like this happened again. I really appreciated that.\n\nThree days later, here\u2019s where we stand: The assistant received her third warning - I don\u2019t know where the first two came from. Today, I received confirmation that she has to leave the company. I think my boss would have preferred not to make this decision, but since the situation spread very quickly through the office grapevine, it seems to have influenced his decision.\n\nAs for the clinic: The first contact was made through my lawyer. I didn\u2019t personally call or inform the data protection officer - the lawyer took care of all of that. The lady at the clinic no longer works there, as the lead doctor seems to be aware of the risks. He apologized both over the phone and in writing, and I\u2019ll be receiving a nice compensation.\n\nAnd with my employer: We were able to agree on a very nice severance package, and the termination of my employment is happening soon.\n\nThese are all nice solutions, but there are still civil and criminal proceedings ongoing, which I can\u2019t discuss right now. The lawyer is motivated to bring further consequences, especially regarding GDPR violations.\n\nAll I can say is: Don\u2019t tolerate this kind of treatment! Last Friday, I was completely overwhelmed and unsure how to handle it. But I received so much support and perspective \u2013 especially here on Reddit \u2013 that I was able to navigate the situation and seek help.\n\nThanks for reading all the way through and for all the responses and comments!\n\n**Reminder - this is a repost.

Clinics like Planned Parenthood do anything sexual health-related: STI screenings and treatment, pregnancy tests, some prenatal care, birth control, non-sexually transmitted infections (e.g., UTIs, yeast infections), hormone-related treatment (e.g., gender affirming, menopause), prostate exams, erectile treatment, and annual wellness exams. Patients who go to those clinics for non-abortion care are usually underserved (e.g., poor or uninsured, undocumented), live in an area where it's hard to find practitioners, or who need additional privacy protections (e.g., victims of incest or rape who don't want their family to find out).\n\nNow, some clinics might have a highly-secure location off-site that does surgical abortion care (this is only 40% of abortions). For example, I live in a state where clinics were bombed and shot up. The \"surgical center\" in my area was unmarked, walled, and you call ahead so they can open the gate to the parking lot. However, those are the exception and the one near me closed after Roe was overturned, I would expect that to be the case nationally.\n\nEdits for grammar.",

My understanding is that, in states where it's still legal, there has historically been less of a bombing risk and abortion services are treated on-site rather than having a separate secured location. \n\nMy point remains, there just aren't enough abortion-only clinics for them to be considered the norm. Definitely not enough for your blanket statement to be accurate. \n\nThe anti-choice movement has messaged, intensely and for decades, that clinics only provide abortions, ergo, closing a clinic isn't denying anyone \"legitimate\" care. That kind of messaging also makes it easier for people to feel justified in protesting clinics, threatening women entering them, and bombing them. \n\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of that messaging, so I thought it worthwhile to offer a counterpoint to your statement.",

Induction wasn\u2019t hard, apparently my body was heading that way anyway.\n\nI\u2019m generally pretty open about it because I think it\u2019s a good learning opportunity because for most people, abortion is more of a concept to be argued about, and I have the ability to put a face - and a heartbreaking reality - on it. My son was very much wanted, and my life is divided into before we lost him and after. \n\n**But I live in a very blue state** (see username). If I were traveling in, let\u2019s say, Alabama, and the topic of pregnancy loss came up, I *might* mention the stillbirth, but I sure as shit wouldn\u2019t mention that we deliberately induced it. **I want to be in control of who knows and who doesn\u2019t know**, and that would be hard to manage if someone at the hospital violated HIPAA and told people about it. And a TFMR is something most people (so far) understand. This was not a quality of life issue. This is a life issue. I can\u2019t even fathom dealing with the stigma on non-TFMR abortion. I know that it\u2019s less stigmatized in Europe but I still would want to be the arbiter of who knows and who doesn\u2019t.\n\nAnd I\u2019m glad OOP got a lawyer\u2019s advice.

That does not mean the company or the hospital are off the hook for the GDPR violation. \n\nGerman labour law is pretty strict when it comes to firing someone. Even for misbehaviour, only the worst cases actually allow for an imediate firing. In most cases, several warnings over no more than 2 years, for related issues, are required. I am not saying that this here was not a case that could justify a firing without warning, but the question is if the employer wants to do this, and risk the Boss filing a lawsuit against the firing (which he would be stupid not to, if he is without related warnings). \n\nIt is totally possible that the boss got consequences, but OOP would not get informed about them. \n\nOOP herself could have kept her job. Nothing in this post even hints towards the employer having a legitimate reason to let her go. The question is if she wants to. She can of course quit, but that leaves her with nothing but the job being gone. By making a mutual termination agreement, they can agree on a severance, paid leave till end of contract, etc.. Chances are she allows them to buy her out and settle/prevent the lawsuit for compensation",

This can stop promotion, good tasks and gets people to look at you differently. And should our Data Protection Laws decide it, then he or the company are fucked. The fines are high for \"a little bit of gossip\". \n\nOOP on the other hand got money, got away from a boss who does not respect her privacy, gets money from the clinic. Enough to look for a job and take their time with it. That is the best they could get.",
