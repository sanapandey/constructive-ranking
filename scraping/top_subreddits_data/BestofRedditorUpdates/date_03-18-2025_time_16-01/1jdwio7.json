Throwaway account since most of my friends know my main account.\n\nI M24 took a few years in photoshop and consider myself to be sort of good at it. I have a female friend (let's call her Ella) who I met about a year ago. She does some photography and modeling as a hobby.\n\nTo start off, I have a small photo retouching business. Nothing special, just a little side gig that makes me some cash on the side while I get my degree. Also, I have a business email set up that I use ONLY FOR MY BUSINESS AND NOTHING ELSE. My friends know this and they know to only send me things on it if they need any work done.\n\nAbout 2 days ago Ella F22 send me a text saying, \"Hey, I'm going to do a shoot today. Would you be able to take a look at some of my pictures when you get the chance?\"\n\nI replied, \"Yeah sure just send them whenever and when I get time I'll take a look.\"\n\nA few hours go by and I get the email. Now, let me say I am not the most attractive guy. I'm pretty short. I exercise regularly but I'm not super fit. My hair is really hard to work with and I feel like I could do a lot better in the looks department. Also I NEVER ask for nudes from ANYONE. I feel like it's disrespectful. Also, I've dated but recently got out of a really nasty relationship that left me feeling pretty self conscious.\n\nAll of this leads to the inclination that if someone is sending me nudes, it's probably not because they're interested.\n\nAnyway, I get the email and it's about 20 nude pictures. Very tasteful and left nothing to the imagination. I figured she was starting an OF or something and since it's her body, her choice and I support my friends in everything they do, I touched them up early this morning.\n\nI just cleaned up some blemishes, got rid of some stray hairs and razor bumps, and touched up some of the coloring. I also made a black and white set along with bit of dodge and burn. The long and short of it is, I spent a lot of time on it.\n\nAfter all of that was done, I sent back the edited versions with the message, \"Hey don't sweat payment. I hope this is what you're looking for. If you need me to take another look let me know.\"\n\nShe sent me a text maybe 15 minutes later saying, \"This isn't what I was looking for at all.\"\n\nI said, \"Oh sorry, I just wasn't sure what you wanted. If you want me to go back and redo it I can.\"\n\nThen I get the text, \"It's fine. I g2g. Bye\"\nSuper confused so I called her roommate (who I am also friends with) and asked if she was okay.\n\nShe let me have it. Started calling me dense, stupid, a jerk, and many other things. Through the insults I finally got the real story. Maybe I'm just naive, but I don't know why she would make it seem as if she wanted me to edit them when she just wanted me to look at them.\n\nThis just happened before I typed the post. I'm really not sure what to do. My last relationship kind of made me weird with dating, so I know I'm not ready. I want to feel like I'm worth something before I start dating again, but at the same time I can't help but feel like I did something wrong. Is there anything I can do to save the friendship?\n\nTL:DR Friend sent nudes to me. I didn't realize the nudes were for my enjoyment, so I retouched then and sent them back. Now she's really mad at me.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**adefsleep**\n\n>I can see why she's upset, but if she's made no attempt to flirt with you or show interest prior to that, considering your craft that's easily confusing.\n\n>Also, wouldn't this be akin to a dude just sending nudes unprompted? You evaded the double standard and treated it logically: you're good with photo editing, she said she had a shoot and asked for your help, so you gave it to her without being a sleezeball.\n\n>You did nothing wrong imo and I think she needs to work on her flirt game.\n\n**OOP**\n\n>>Yeah, it was totally out if nowhere. I'm thinking maybe she hit the gas a little too hard.\n\n**MoonStar31**\n\n>>>From someone who married someone like you that can\u2019t take an obvious hint, she WAS probably sending hints and flirting (in her mind) and you just weren\u2019t getting it. She was tired of waiting and went nuclear. Overboard? Absolutely. But I get it!\n\n**~**\n\n**papabear345**\n\n>Tbh that was an entertaining read.\n\n>Everything isn\u2019t about looks and you sound to have it way more together then her. Value yourself, you sound like a winner and she seems to lack a bit of communication skills there.\n\n>That all said if you don\u2019t want to let the opportunity go to waste send a quick message explaining you thought she was interested as a friend and just wanted your professional help, but revisiting that position they are excellent pictures and whether she wants you to take her for a drink?\n\n**OOP**\n\n>>I sent her a text not to long ago explaining myself. Still waiting on a reply. Maybe I could play it by saying I'll buy her drink as an apology.\n\n**~**\n\n**denonemc**\n\n>Is that common to send 20 nudes at once? That seems excessive.\n\n**OOP**\n\n>>I'm definitely not the authority on how many nudes should be sent, however she does photography and modeling as a hobby. I don't know if that changes anything\n\n**denonemc**\n\n>>>So this is her TIFU. She's a model and you do Photoshop. Easy equation lol\n\n**OOP Also added in another comment**\n\n>It is, however it wouldn't be the first time I've touched up nudes for a friend. One of our friends does OF and everyone knows I touch up her photos. My friends soft of have blanket consent to send me anything they need worked on.\n\n**Update 1 Posted Jan 6, 2022/Same Day**\n\n[updates - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/rxqlmb)\n\nUpdate: She texted back an apologized for the whole thing. I don't think we are going to pursue a relationship, but we are still going to hang out and be friends.\n\n\nAlso to the person who sent the nude. \nWhat kind of work did you want done to it? I think you look good as is, but if you had something in mind let me know.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**linzer-beam**\n\n>You did absolutely nothing wrong. This was a really odd way to go about things on her end. Like\u2026if I were her, I wouldn\u2019t send the nudes to your work email for exactly this reason. She could\u2019ve easily texted you if she was so bold. I guess her being mad could just be a knee-jerk reaction or deflection to being embarrassed (I\u2019ve definitely done that before), but it\u2019s still just so odd to me!\n\n>I did see your comment about offering to go out for drinks to apologize/set everything straight.\n\n**OOP**\n\n>>We talked and she said she was more embarrassed than angry. Her reason was she wanted it to have a \"shock factor\" to it and thought it would \"set her apart\" but instead it was just awkward\n\n**Update 2 posted Jan 6/Same day**\n\nUpdate 2: The roommate just called an apologized. I'm still pretty mad at her for all the hurtful things she said and I made that clear. She told me she went ahead and doordashed me some dinner to make up for it.\n\nTo the second person who sent the nude titled \"No editing needed\" I appreciate the picture. Thank you! I did see evidence of a few areas getting selected on your downstairs. Just know, the body you have is fine the way it is and doesn't require any changes. Again thank you for the picture!\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**yusquera**\n\n>This is absurd.. are you a character in an anime?\n\n**OOP**\n\n>>This made me laugh really hard, but no this is by far the craziest story I have now.\n\n**Last update posted Jan 7, 2022/Next Day**\n\nLast update: Looks like it's all over now. I'm going to start hitting the gym to work on self esteem. I've also decided that I'm going to take a break from her and the roommate for a while.\n\nAlso, if any of you need advice on photoshop, photography, or need me to review your work. My DMs are open to you! Please message me first before just blindly sending nudes. Super awkward to open a random nude in front of my roommate like help me out and give some warning first.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**",

The fact that he's distancing from them makes me wonder if they double downed and started saying shit.  \nI've run into this a few times in my life and honestly? It's not an being naive or oblivious. It's the route of 'assume politeness until proving otherwise'. Because flirting is an evolving beast and everyone's beast is different.

If some guy I was friends with asked me to come over to help him with his dog, I would 100% show up with my bag of medical crap, check out the dog, and do whatever was needed. Even if they asked me to stay and hang out, or offered to take me to dinner as a \u201cthank you\u201d, I would take it at face value, decline, and go home. \n\nI mean obviously sending sexual material is different, but even if it was painfully obvious to others that it was a ploy to get me to come over, and so he would have an \u201cexcuse\u201d to take me out for ~~dinner~~ a date, I wouldn\u2019t even consider that motive a possibility. Why?  BECAUSE ITS MY FREAKING JOB. People do this kind of thing to me all the time who oddly enough, have no intention of tricking me into a date at the end, nor do they have a crush on me.  They quite literally want me to check out their dog\u2019s ears, or trim its nails or whatever.  \n\nAs OOP said - this woman said she had a legit photo shoot and was going to send him some pics from it. She gave the impression that this strictly a professional situation. OOP also has reviewed and touched up nudes for other friends who literally just wanted him to touch up their nudes, so again, because he is the professional that he is, treated it as such. \n\nThis was not out of the ordinary for him. It was not a weird situation for him to find himself in. What the woman should have done, was text him: \u201cI just sent over some photos to you. Let me know what you think about them \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09. I can\u2019t wait to hear from you!\u201d\n\nShe was shooting her shot, which I give her credit for being bold.

I don't get why people don't seem to want to read things that way.\n\nAs an autistic who sucks at reading flirting queues, even if I'm not experienced in the dating department, I would have no qualms about clarifying that sort of thing and just tying the mistake into the moment and moving past it, because I've been on the other end of things a few times. Genuine misunderstandings can happen and it's so easy to avoid them.

He gave her an out, which she took, because OP seemed like he does not want her. IF she was going to be more forward, she risks either being a creep or being more hurt when the guy has to turn her down even harder. It is not a good situation to be in. Also assuming someone is as dense as a brick can be pretty insulting, too. Or a serious turn off. I can imagine her wanting him to do the final move and sweep her off her feet and when he isn't like that she is just happy to get her computer fixed.\n\nJust to clarify, I think OOP did nothing wrong, the flirter fucked up by not going to his private mail address. In the above, if someone calls me to fix a computer problem and they open the door in lingerie I either act like the guy to not have sex and let them down gently, or try to see if I can move it forward but not being too forward (read, get consent \"you need some help with something before I fix the computer?\").",

Turns out it was a poem about me lol, and she asked me out by showing me the last stanza, which was obviously romantic. It was very sweet.\n\nI loved that poem so much I memorized it. I ended up actually borrowing a line from it and turning it into a username when I needed a new one at some point while we were dating. I haven't spoken to her in years at this point, it was an online relationship that didn't last because we were like 15/16, but I still know the whole poem and my current username (wilderneyes) is the one I took from it, I'm still using it 10 years later.

At one particular stop, the waitress at our pizza crawl had a thing for me (I was completely oblivious to it). At the end of the our quick meal, we got up to leave. As I\u2019m walking out, she comments on my shirt and where I got it. I, in my usual obliviousness to flirtation said, \u201cThanks! I got it at thinkgeek.com\u201d, side stepped around her and walked out. My wife had stayed behind to see what was happening and then laughed at the poor waitress and came out to tell me that I was totally being hit on and if I wanted to, I should go back and get her number. \n\nTo this day, that is my wife\u2019s favorite story and proof that I\u2019d never cheat on her because I wouldn\u2019t know if a woman is hitting on me or not. In all honesty, the reality is a lot sadder than what she points out. I\u2019ve been rejected so many times by what I thought was obvious flirting that I\u2019ve trained myself to not feel that way anymore. So if a woman hits on me, she\u2019s just friendly.",

At one particular stop, the waitress at our pizza crawl had a thing for me (I was completely oblivious to it). At the end of the our quick meal, we got up to leave. As I\u2019m walking out, she comments on my shirt and where I got it. I, in my usual obliviousness to flirtation said, \u201cThanks! I got it at thinkgeek.com\u201d, side stepped around her and walked out. My wife had stayed behind to see what was happening and then laughed at the poor waitress and came out to tell me that I was totally being hit on and if I wanted to, I should go back and get her number. \n\nTo this day, that is my wife\u2019s favorite story and proof that I\u2019d never cheat on her because I wouldn\u2019t know if a woman is hitting on me or not. In all honesty, the reality is a lot sadder than what she points out. I\u2019ve been rejected so many times by what I thought was obvious flirting that I\u2019ve trained myself to not feel that way anymore. So if a woman hits on me, she\u2019s just friendly.",

It doesn't sound like she's doing magazine covers or anything, and modeling is often more about having certain features like clear skin and fitting a particular niche than it is about being conventionally attractive. Plenty of sites where I browse for clothes have models that, well, wouldn't have people with default cultural attractions saying \"Omg a short funny-looking guy could NEVER pull her!\" She might even be the one paying people to take pictures of *her* (or, as a photographer herself, setting up self-portraits), if she's just doing it entirely as a hobby and not a job-- like a hobby writer paying a vanity press.\n\nIt's also not especially difficult to become adept enough with photoshop to do basic retouching work as a side hustle, from what I understand. It doesn't sound like *he's* doing magazine covers either. (Edit: this is not to insult OOP's skills of course; just to say that it's entirely realistic that he could have them.) And men who aren't conventionally attractive are often deeply insecure and overlook their own merits in other departments; if anything, the only thing that's unusual about OOP is that he hasn't let that insecurity fester into anger and/or desperation, and instead turned it inward.\n\nAn awkward attempt at a proposition using ineffective means that gets completely misinterpreted also doesn't seem particularly unrealistic to me lol, regardless of whom it's coming from.",
