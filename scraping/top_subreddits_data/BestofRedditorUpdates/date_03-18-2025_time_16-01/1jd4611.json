I had no idea he did it and he's missed several payments. I'm about to buy a house, I'm mad, confused and scared**\n\n**NEW UPDATE MARKED WITH** ----\n\n**Thanks to u/soayherder for suggesting this BoRU**\n\n**Trigger Warnings:** >!credit fraud!<\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**RECAP**\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditScore/s/64hkXsJG5l): **September 6, 2024**\n\nMy dad called me on Friday, which was weird because we really only talk around Christmas due to his domestic violence issues when I was a child. He told me last year he took out a $25,000 loan in my name. He said he needed it to pay off his credit cards but he's ran them back up again. He said he wanted to at least give me a heads up as I was probably going to be sued by the loan company because he can no longer make the payments. He never apologized for taking the loan out in my name and he told me to say that I was hacked.\n\nI felt sick to my stomach. When I checked my credit I saw my credit score tanked by probably 250 points from where it was last July. 5 MISSED PAYMENTS, a loan that I owe about $24,000 on and I just broke down crying. This has never happened to me before. My mom and sister are both out of the country until the start of next week and I'm lost. I can pay off the loan in cash but I don't feel like I should have to as I never took it out.\n\n**Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Copying this for every identity theft situation I see on here (since it seems to happen a lot) where you **know** who the person is who stole your identity. This is all information you can find in this sub and others:\n\n1: **CALL THE POLICE** - You're the victim of identity theft, plain and simple, it doesn't matter who did it or what your relationship is to them. They broke the law, now they have to face the consequences of their actions.\n\n2: **Freeze your credit** - You want to make sure it doesn't happen again, take the proactive route of [freezing](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-know-about-credit-freezes-and-fraud-alerts) your credit.\n\n3: **Monitor and track your credit** - You need to be alerted if anyone tries opening a line of credit in your name. [This gives you a way to do it and it shows your credit score](https://everydayeconomics.net/how-to-get-all-3-credit-scores-and-monitor-your-credit/)\n\n4: **Warn anyone else who might be a victim** - This includes family members or anyone else whose social security number might be compromised by the thief.\n\n5: **Take the police report to the credit bureaus** - Give them the report number when you dispute all of the accounts. Most of the time, that will be enough for them to take the accounts off of your credit. It's on the creditors themselves to prove the accounts are legitimately yours and the bureaus aren't going to get in the middle of it. A police report goes a long way in clearing up your credit.\n\nDon't take identity theft lying down, even if it's someone close to you. If you let them get away with it, get ready for 5-10 years of bad credit, collection agencies coming after you, lawsuits, etc.\n\nIt's frustrating how easy it is for someone with your social security number to take out a huge loan in your name. If you pay off the loan, those missed payments will haunt you for 7 years. Of course he never apologized for it, he's not sorry, he probably just doesn't want you going to the police, thinking some rando stole your identity when it was him.\n\nGo to the police, follow the steps above, cut off contact with your dad unless he wants to text you to admit to it again.\n\n**Commenter 2:** Commenter 1\u2019s advice is 100% spot on, but this also needs to be stressed: **DO NOT MAKE ANY PAYMENTS. Doing so will be taken as you accepting responsibility for the loan in its entirety.**\n\nThe only recourse that gets you fully off the hook for this debt is to report the identity theft to the police.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditScore/s/NKgG84sQJU): **December 26, 2024 (3.5 months later)**\n\nChristmas came and went and I did not speak to him this year. A couple of days after my op I made a report to the police. They said this happens a lot and they gave me a form to fill out. I received a case number and disputed the account with the credit companies. Maybe 2 weeks after I did that, a guy showed up at my house and served me with a lawsuit.\n\nThe weird thing was the account dropped off of my credit completely and my credit score shot up back to where it was. Even so, I feel like the company that gave the loan was trying to get a judgement against me, probably hoping I wouldn't show up to court. I ended up filling out a FOIA request for the actual police report. When the court date came, their lawyer offered to settle for $15,000. I gave them the police report and they were actually way more cool about it than I expected. He said he'd send it to the company and request a continuance, but that I should show up to the continuance date.\n\nThe 2nd court date was last week and the lawyer wasn't even there. Apparently shortly after the first court date, he filed a motion to dismiss.\n\nAs far as I know, this is over with, but it still shows I've been sued in a public records search. Is there any way to get that removed?\n\nI'm also in closing for a house! I really appreciate everyone for their advice, you've all saved me from a lot of debt and years of ruined credit.\n\n**Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** The lawsuit was filed, that's a public record and can't be reversed. The dismissal should also be a public record. Because there was no judgment it isn't a negative item for credit reporting.\n\n**Commenter 2:** OP could just check the court docket to confirm that they withdrew the complaint and that the matter is closed. Might want to do that and save the docket report for own records too.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n-------------------\n\n#----NEW UPDATE----\n\n[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditScore/s/EV7GBZOhJr): **March 10, 2025 (three months later)**\n\nI haven't heard any more about a lawsuit, it's been dismissed and I doubt it's coming back! Even more exciting - I bought my first house! I'm extremely happy with it and my credit score barely took a hit from it. I assume it will be back to normal with a couple months of payments.\n\nHowever, it turns out I wasn't the only person my dad hit with identity theft. My mom and my sister both had their identities stolen and loans taken out in their names. The loans looked like they were taken out just after my dad told me about the loan he took out in my name.\n\nThey both found out about the loans the same way - with a lawsuit. My mom's has already been dismissed and my sister's I think is in the process of being dismissed, but online court records aren't available for hers.\n\nMy dad has also moved from where he used to live. I know what state he's in but not exactly where. He also has a new phone number, big surprise.\n\nWe don't know for sure that he opened the new loans, but it seems pretty obvious.\n\n**Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** Everyone needs to lock their credit and social security numbers or he's going to try it again.\n\n**Commenter 2:** Damn, what a scum. Hate people like that. He got you guys into debt and tried to run away and hide by moving to a different state with a new phone number.\nI\u2019m sorry you had to go through that OP.\n\n**Commenter 3:** I can\u2019t believe so many parents are doing this to their own children . It\u2019s so sad. You may have to report him to get it off your credit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs \u2013 BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**",

Given the sheer volume of cold-call loan offers and pre-approved credit card junk mail that gets thrown at Americans every day, I bet a large percentage of these accounts exist entirely because they are convenient to have and not just easy to get - you almost have have to actively avoid signing up! Plus, credit scores are largely based on your ratio of debt to total credit available, so having another card you don\u2019t use just improves your credit score. Because, of course, once available, the temptation to use that credit increases for most people. Anyway, my point is that the money lost to fraud has most likely been calculated as \u201cworth it\u201d",

Each person has an identity card provided with a serial number, a picture and some of your personal data (address, parents, place of birth).

Credit cards are always provided by banks, so they'd need to access your bank account to be able to ask for one. \n\nCredit companies and banks are held responsible for fraud too if they don't verify correctly the identity of the one asking for the loan, so they take this thing seriously.\n\nUsually fraud is committed against the public state, as in \"I'm pocketing my disabled sister's pension\" or receiving benefits someone is not supposed to receive.",

The lender doesn't want criminal charges either - because there is a high chance that it will show that they were negligent in their duties to verify the id of the borrower.

There's really no reason to leave it unfrozen since it's very fast and easy to unfreeze your credit temporarily when you need to (takes les than an hour). It's also not hard, nor does it cost any money, to sign up for freezing your data with the 3 bureaus. I personally have all of my debit and credit cards set up to send me an email anytime there's a charge for more than 1 cent too, so I will know right away if my card is stolen or skimmed. There's just no guarantee that your financial data won't be stolen and used at some point nowadays, and doubly so if you have a family member like OOP's dad who knows your social.",

This is US based advice. \n\nThere are three agencies that handle credit scores here:\n\n [TransUnion](https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze)\n\n[Experian](https://www.experian.com/help/credit-freeze/)\n\nand [Equifax](https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/)\n\nThose links go to their credit-freezing pages.\n\nYou have to create accounts at each to freeze your credit, and at least one of them tries really hard to get you to sign up for a paid service to freeze credit, but you don't have to, so poke around till you find the free one.\n\nAfter that's done, no credit can be opened in your name without you unfreezing your credit. I went for a new credit card about a month after freezing mine, forgot to unfreeze before going to the bank, whoops. Had to do it once back home and wrangle the bank's customer service line. I assume all three agencies have apps, might want to look into that. Or not, if you're as suspicious as I am, and you try to keep sensitive stuff off your phone. \n\nYou also will get notified by at least one of these agencies if someone tries to use your credit, and if your score changes, so that's nice.\n\nFreezing your credit means no new lines of credit in your name (card, mortgage, loan, etc) can be opened without your unfreezing. Your already existing lines are unaffected, as are any future ones you set up (unfreeze, apply, notification of approval/denial, freeze). So yes, you can use your credit cards as usual, just can't open another without the song and dance...and neither can anyone else. \n\nFrankly, if you're in the US, it's dumb not to do this, particularly given current events.",
