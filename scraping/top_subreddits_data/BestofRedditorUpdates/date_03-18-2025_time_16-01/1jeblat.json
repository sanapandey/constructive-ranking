This may end up being a wall of text, but here goes.\n\nI've been dating my GF, Anna, for about 1.5 years. Five months ago we moved in together, got a dog, and bought all new furniture. I've previously been married, so I didn't want to rush - but I'm head over heals for this girl. I made sure that she didn't feel like it was too fast, because she is younger than I, and this was a major concern. Anna told me that she was ready for this and we both wanted to start our life together.\n\nWhen Anna and I started dating, she was 6 months out of a 5 year relationship in which her now ex was distant and ignored her. Eventually she got tired of it and left him. I was worried I was a rebound at first, but she quickly alleviated that concern.\n\nI've tried to do my best to show her how nuts I am about her. I've never felt this way about anyone before; I tell her often how much she means to me, and I try to do little things like picking up flowers, surprise dates, etc.\n\nWe've both been happy, but over time I've started to notice her being a bit emotionally distant - she would tell me she loved me when I told her first, and she would reply to cute texts most the time, but she didn't really initiate either. I started to feel like she was just going though the motions and not really feeling it. I would try to talk with her about this, and she would get upset. Anna would tell me \"We're fine. Drop it.\" I tried, but it didn't feel like we were ok. I started to fall into a cycle of worrying about us, which would make her mad, which would make me worry more.\n\nThis reached a head on Thanksgiving. We went to her large family thanksgiving (50+ people) and I can admit, I was needy. I felt like she was mad at me, because she was being abrupt. I felt this horrible distance and no matter what I could do, it just got worse. We went home the next day and she told me that she needed a break. I asked what was going on and she said that she was exhausted by having to reassure me about our relationship and that I didn't believe her when she told me she loved me. I left and stayed at a hotel for two days.\n\nWhen I returned home, she said she wanted to make it work. I told her I would try to need less, if she could try to give more. I really wanted her to take the initiative sometimes, and I recognized that I was being needy.\n\nWe did well for a while - I told myself that she was showing love for me in other ways (making dinner, asking what I wanted to watch, going on dog walks with me) even if she wasn't taking the initiative in the ways I did. Anna told me she saw me working on it and we were doing well.\n\nMaking Christmas plans, I asked Anna if she wanted me to come to her parents, and she told me she really wanted it to be just her family. Trying to not be needy, I accepted this and made plans to go to my parents. We celebrated our 'couples' Christmas about a week before before she planned on going to her parents (about 1.5 hours away) and I was going to mine (9 hours away) for actual Christmas. The plan was for me to meet her at her parents for new years, and we would go home the next day.\n\nDuring our week apart, I started to miss her. I tried not to be needy, just a text every now and then and a call on Christmas day. She also kept in better contact which I enjoyed. I was a little concerned when I learned that Anna was letting her best friend plan her birthday later this month instead of me (Anna planned mine, I assumed I would plan hers). She told me it was no big deal, I tried to let it go even though I felt excluded. I also got concerned about our lease - we had a chance to save 5% in rent, if we signed early for another year. I asked her about it and even though I thought we both liked the apartment, she said she didn't want to lock in for another year because she wasn't sure where she wanted to be in a year. This worried me, we had talked about staying another year. I asked \"You mean about the apartment, right...not us?\" I know it was a stupid question. She got mad and said \"God! Yes, we're fine.\" I apologized.\n\nI was excited for us to see each other on new years eve. I'm a romantic, and I was hoping for the storybook giant hug, kiss and I missed you. When I arrived at her parents, she came out with our dog and I told her how much I missed and loved her, she said \"Ok. Missed you too.\" No smile, no kiss, no nothing. I got a sinking feeling. I told her flat out \"I'm not trying to be needy babe, but I was hoping you would be excited to see me.\" She told me she was excited, I was just more enthusiastic about it. I let it go, and we went out with friends for new years. I still felt this distance.\n\nNew years morning we woke up, I rolled over and told her that I wanted 2018 to be the year we really focus on us, that I was excited to keep working on getting us to a good place. She didn't seem to care. I asked he what was going on, and said once again, \"We're FINE. Drop it.\" I told her that I didn't feel like we were fine, why can't we talk about stuff? Why can't I get any real emotions from you?\n\nShe went off. She told me that she was exhausted by how needy I am, and was tired of reassuring me and she didn't feel like anything had gotten better since our break. I told her that it's hard to be feel secure when she keeps making me feel insecure and I thought she said we were getting better. She told me she isn't my mother and that's not her job. I told her I love her, and I want to make this work, but we BOTH need to be working at it.\n\nShe told me she didn't want to work at it and we were done. I asked her not to do this again (the after thanksgiving break), that we can fight/argue/disagree and fix things instead of just breaking up. She told me again she was tired of trying, we were done. I dropped her off at her parents and told her \"I love you...please don't do this, if you love me we can make this work\" she replied \"I'm not happy. I don't love you right now.\"\n\nI left, and I haven't seen her in 4 days. I haven't heard anything from her. One of my friends texted her asking what happened and she told her \"he's a great person, he will make someone happy someday\". I talked to her friend (the one planning the birthday) who told me \"I told her she shouldn't have gotten back with you after thanksgiving. I think she moved in with you out of convenience. She likes you as a person but you're different people.\" Obviously not what I wanted to hear and I don't know what to make of it.\n\nSo there we are - I'm feeling lost, sad, pissed off and alone. My friends have been super supportive, but I miss Anna (and our dog). I've been alone in our home, sleeping alone in our bed, miserable.\n\nI guess this post is part venting, part asking advice. What do I do from here? I'm afraid if I call or text her she will just see me being needy again. I honestly love Anna and want it to work, but I don't know how to make it better, or if she even wants to. I don't know if I'm being unreasonable wanting her to be more emotionally available. I don't know when she is coming home or anything.\n\nThank you all for sticking with this long post.\n\nTL/DR: GF is fed up with my emotional needs, I feel like she can be distant and excludes me. She told me we're done and I haven't heard or seen her in days.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**crystal\\_lightt**\n\n>This post makes me really sad, you sound like such a caring person with a lot of love to give.\n\n>From the sounds of it you guys are just incompatible in terms of emotional sensitivity, affection and love languages. From your description she sounds pretty cold and closed off - I\u2019m wondering if she could also have an avoidant attachment style (could be insightful to read about this if you haven\u2019t already).\n\n>It\u2019s hard to say how much, if any, of this is you being needy versus her just being unreasonably distant and cold. I totally get that it\u2019s annoying and maybe a dealbreaker to constantly have to reassure a partner, but it actually sounds like she\u2019s offering you way too little emotionally by (I\u2019d guess) most people\u2019s standards.\n\n>I\u2019m very sorry that she has ended things, that is so difficult to deal with. Try to remember that this will allow you to meet someone else who will happily return your love and affection and not be put off by talking about emotions or your relationship. Since you described her as lacking so much affection, kindness and patience, I\u2019m curious what good qualities she does have that make you love her?\n\n**OOP**\n\n>Thank you for the kind and thoughtful reply. Reading it actually made me cry.\n\n>It's hard to nail down what you love about someone. I love her smile, I love the way she used to look at me, I love that she is smart, and we feel the same about most things. I love how excited she gets about her work.\n\n**Labraderp**\n\n>I have been a lot like you in the past, OP, and am now more like Anna. So how I see it is that you're completely overwhelming her with your constant anxiety about the relationship. It's not easy to deal with someone who needs reassuring all the time. So a break up is honestly probably for the best. Maybe you should take some time to reflect exactly what it is you want from a relationship that you weren't getting from her. And it's probably also a good idea to seek some therapy to work through this out of control anxiety. It's easy to see that you've got a good heart and it's in the right place. But for some people the need to constantly deal with baseless anxiety is just too much.\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7umlin/updatemy_gf_26_f_of_15_years_told_me_37_m_i_was/) **February 2, 2018**\n\n*EDIT*: Thank you all for the advice and feedback. For clarity sake, I wasn't trying to win Anna back after all the shit she pulled. At first, absolutely, but not now. Of course I miss what we had, but I am ready for this to be over with. She told me yesterday that she is moving out this weekend.\n\nA week passed after the breakup, and I heard nothing from Anna; I took everyone's advice and did not contact her. I came home from the gym (also took that advice) one night and there she was, sitting on the couch, crying.\n\nI sat by her and she unloaded. She told me that she was sorry; that she had treated me like her ex had treated her (as mentioned in the old post, her ex was distant/unavailable and neglected her for five years), she said that I wasn't too needy, she just couldn't open up. She said that I was the best boyfriend she had ever had, that our relationship was amazing and I had done nothing wrong. I told her that I still loved her, that she was the best part of my life. I asked her if she wanted to work it out. She said \"No. We're done. I don't feel butterflies every day.\" I told her that real adult relationships take work, that you wont feel that new love butterfly feeling everyday but you work on it and make sure you are both happy. She told me it was easier to leave that to work on it, and that was what she wanted to do.\n\nAfter we spoke, she gathered some clothes and left again, presumably to her parents. She returned a few days later and was a different person. I would try to tell her that I still loved her and we could work it out. She would act like she couldn't hear me or I wasn't there - like literally staring past me. Eventually she yelled at me, \"Why are you fighting for this?! It's DONE!\" I told her fine, if she wanted to leave the life we started (apartment, dog, furniture etc) then she needed to leave. I told her that I couldn't bear to live with her as roommates and not as a couple. She said she would start looking for a new place. I told her I would be keeping the dog. She told me she hated me for doing so, and said \"See?! I knew you were an asshole! I'm glad I left you!\"\n\nAfter a few days of sleeping on the couch while she was in what was our bedroom, I came home from work and she had moved all of my things (clothes, possessions, everything) out of our bedroom and into the guest bedroom and bathroom. She told me the master bedroom and bath were hers and not to go near them. I asked that we at least be civil to one another - if for no other reason than to honor the relationship we had. She ignored me and continued to act like I wasn't there. I told her she needed to find a new place asap.\n\nWe continued like this for a while - her acting like I wasn't there, me being heartbroken. I stopped trying to talk to her about working it out. At every opportunity, she would make a nasty or mean comment: telling me not to sit on 'her' couch (we financed the furniture in her name, as her credit was better), telling me not to eat her food (that we had bought together), throwing clothes that I had bought for her at me saying \"Give these to your next fucking girlfriend!\", 'accidentally' dropping my toothbrush in the trash, talking on the phone and loudly saying \"yea he's still here...I know he's an asshole\", etc.\n\nShe's acting like I cheated on her, or decided to end the relationship or somehow wronged her. In the meantime, most of her friends and family, including her mother who called me crying, have been asking what is wrong with her and why she is doing this. I'm not digging, and I'm not reaching out to them, but all of them are telling me she has gone off the deep end.\n\nAbout two and a half weeks after the breakup, with us still in the same place, I was at dinner with a friend who was using a dating app - he opened it and the first profile to show up was Anna. She used pictures of us with me cropped out as her profile. I was devastated. When I got home I told her I had seen her profile and she literally laughed in my face. She said \"Yea, how else am I going to get over you?\" I was mad, heartbroken and confused. I told her that it made me feel like we meant nothing to her. I asked \"Did we mean that little to you, you didn't even wait a month?\" She shrugged and walked away. She left that evening, and didn't come home until the next morning, in the same clothes. She did that two more days in a row. I'm not an idiot, I've seen a walk of shame before.\n\nSunday she came home to pick up some clothes. I asked if she was staying. She said \"No, I have a ride waiting. Don't go outside.\" I looked out the window and there was some ugly dude in a car. I couldn't believe this shit. I said \"Are you fucking kidding?! Are you dating him or something?!\" She replied \"No, I'm just sleeping with him.\" Again, I was floored...see a trend?\n\nI could not fucking believe this. Less than three weeks ago I wanted to spend my life with this woman. A month ago we talked about buying a house, and now this?! I said \"Does he know about me? Does he know that you still live with the man you said you wanted to spend your life with?!\" She said no. I told her I should go introduce myself and she replied \"Why do you want to ruin this for me?\" - I had no words.\n\nI went outside, she followed and jumped in his car. They sped off. I called her, it went to voicemail. I left the following message: \"Anna, I loved you without condition since we met. I did nothing but support, honor, respect and care for you. I can not believe you would do this and bring him here. You are acting like garbage. Seriously, you're fucking trashy. What happened to you? Don't you ever dare bring him, or anyone else, to my home again. I don't know what happened to the woman I loved but she is dead to me. I need you to move out asap.\"\n\nShe returned two days ago and told me that if I speak to her she will call the cops for harassment. She started \"packing\" by putting my bath towels (hers before we moved in together, we donated my stuff because we would have doubles) in a box, as well as other things I use on a daily basis (she took the soap and toaster, who does that). I tried to talk to her, I asked her, \"Cant we at least be civil and decent to one another? We loved each other for a long time, doesn't that at least mean something? She told me \"It didn't mean anything. You didn't mean anything.\" That leveled me. After that She didn't speak except to say \"Oh, you probably noticed the hicky on my neck, yea I don't remember which one gave me that.\"\n\nI'm done. I'm disgusted by her behavior, and heartbroken missing the woman I used to know and love. She has told me she will give me 30 days notice when she plans to leave. I'm counting the minutes. in the meantime, it feels like she is taking every opportunity to hurt me, make me feel small, and treat me like I wronged her. She has even taken to ignoring the dog we got together, not taking it out when I am not home then texting me \"your dog peed on the floor, you're not a very good pet owner.\"\n\nI wanted to thank everyone who messaged and replied to the last thread - this has been one of the hardest times of my life, and you have all been very supportive. I'm starting therapy next week, and I have signed up for a kickboxing class.\n\nI'm ready to move on, even if I am not ready to be healed yet.\n\n**TL:DR**\u00a0: Anna came home, has started dating/sleeping with rando's and is acting like the breakup was my idea. Waiting for her to move out.\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**NDaveT**\n\n>Stop trying to win her back, stop trying to guilt her for moving on, stop expecting anything from her.\n\n>Yes, she's acting horribly. Don't play her game.\n\n**BoneDru**\n\n>I don't condone your girlfriend's behavior, but here's what she's thinking and why she's acting this way:\n\n>In her mind, she sacrificed a lot and made a lot of changes to move in with you. Then, you turned out not to be who she thought you were. Instead of being the great guy who would lead her to the great future she imagined, you were kind of a mopey needy guy who was hard to live with.\n\n>After seeing that side of you, she felt \"tricked\", even betrayed.\n\n>She sacrificed for you, and you tricked her, and now she wants to hurt you. She's fresh out of what she thought would be a serious relationship, so she doesn't want anything serious right now, so she's online looking for hook-ups and doing quite well it sounds like.\n\n>To her credit, she didn't try to rub that in your face until you made an issue about it. You found out about her dating life independently. She thinks she should be able to come and go without you keeping tabs on her and start her new life. She's already sacrificed enough for you.\n\n**giiiirlwhattheheck**\n\n>dude, fuck that apartment. talk to your leasing company and ask if you can find someone to sublease the second room to in order to absolve you from the lease. there are lots of great apartments. you only want to stay out of your spiteful feelings for her. she is self-destructing, don't let her damage you any more than she already has.\n\n**OOP**\n\n>Thanks for the feedback. Anna is supposedly moving out this weekend.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP**\n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**",

She might have responded immaturely but he's bringing a lot of this on himself. From her perspective she's just trying to move on with single life while her pathetic needy ex continues to try and insert himself back into it. He needs to accept that other men are giving her hickies now and leave her alone, as she repeatedly requests throughout the post",

In my personal opinion, I only feel comfortable with them after about 25. Whilst this man is certainly older, that doesn\u2019t mean he has to just understand what she means. It wasn\u2019t a him problem. If we believe the part of her family and friends being concerned and thinking she\u2019s having an episode, it\u2019s a mental crisis on her part as well.\n\nPlease forgive me if this isn\u2019t insightful.
