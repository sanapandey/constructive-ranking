I live alone, but I use the second bedroom as my office because I work from home full-time.\n\nMy older sister, \"Lily\" (31F), is 6 months pregnant and soon to be single mother.\n\nShe has some issues with her apartment (in a disagreement with her landlord, and in the process of moving out), so she asked if she could stay with me for a few weeks. Of course, I said yes and that I would be happy to accomodate her for as long as she needs.\n\nShe moved in last weekend, and the first thing she did when settling in was pointing towards my bed and saying: \"I'll take this one.\" I laughed, thinking she was joking. Only later in the evening when I asked her if she needs anything else before going to bed did she mention that she was not joking about wanting to sleep in my bed.\n\nNow I'm a little bit of a germophob, and I am quite uncomfortable with the idea of other people sleeping in my bed.\n\nI told her that I am uncomfortable letting anyone else sleep in my bed. But I will gladly set her up with my guest bed (which I did use to sleep on before buying my current bed, and I know for a fact is very comfortable and spacious).\n\nThen, she started guilt tripping me saying that since she got pregnant she's having problems falling asleep and that she needs the bigger more comfortable bed.\n\nI stood my ground and told her I was happy to accommodate her, but I wasn\u2019t giving up my bedroom. She sulked, but she took the guest bed.\n\nThat lasted exactly two nights before she started complaining that the bed was \u201ctoo stiff\u201d and that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d I offered to buy a new mattress topper, but she refused. Instead, she tried to pull the \"you\u2019re my brother, you should want to make me comfortable\" guilt trip again...\n\nI told her that she is lucky I can even take her in, since I work 10 hours a day from home and I do value having a work enviroment that's private, calm and quiet.\n\nShe called me selfish and accused me of not caring about her or her baby. I told her she could take the couch if the guest bed was that unbearable.\n\nWell, she did... but exactly for 1 night before turning into an absolute menace.\n\nIn the second night on the couch, she made sure to sigh loudly all night, \"accidentally\" bump into things, and complain the next morning about how \"horrible\" I was making her feel.\n\nThe following day, she kept making calls and talking loudly on the phone while I was working.\n\nI didn't pay attention to the actual calls and what she was saying, but later it became very clear...\n\nIn the evening I started getting phone calls from most if not all of my family members.\n\nApparently, she was ranting all day on the phone to my family about how rude and how horrible I was making her feel, trying to make my family put pressure on me just to let her sleep in my bed... Like she's on a mission or something..\n\nMy mom took her side and tore me a new one on the phone saying that Lily is carrying a child and I'm being inconsiderate, she also said \"I thought I taught you better hospitality than this, I am very disappointed\".\n\nMy aunt called to tell me that my uncle (her husband) used to sleep on the couch and sometimes on the floor next to her when she was pregnant.\n\nEven my cousin (who I haven't spoken to in like 2 years) called to tell me I'm being selfish.\n\nMy father is taking my side telling me to ignore them and that my sister is a fuck up that she got in that situation in the first place... But I feel like my mom is giving him a super hard time in the background because he did sound kind of hesitant when I asked him to have my back.\n\nHonestly I'm just feeling like I'm in the middle of a soap opera drama.\n\nMy mom is threatening to come take Lily home (yea like that's much of a threat haha) but she's giving me such a hard time and telling me I disappointed her and that she raised me better..\n\nI don't know how to feel about this anymore..\n\nAITAH for not letting my pregnant sister sleep in my bed?\n\n**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**\n\n**Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** NTA\n\nTell your sister, your Mom has offered to let her stay, so \"pack your bags if the guest bed is uncomfortable\".\n\nEveryone who has called, call them back and ask when they intend to pick up your sister to stay with them.\n\n**Commenter 2:** Get her out of your house ASAP. You\u2019re going to end up with her in your room, baby in guest room and you\u2019re going to be sleeping on the couch.\n\nCheck your lease and tenancy laws. Do not let her use your address for mail. Seriously, get her out before she gives birth. Ship her off to mom.\n\n**Commenter 3:** \u201cI offered you a place to live and you have returned that favor by turning a bunch of flying monkeys on me so you can steal my bed on top of the rest of my home. You are disrupting my work and my life. I expect you to be out tomorrow. Maybe one of your flying monkeys will take you in.\u201d NTA.\n\n**Commenter 4:** NTA and I would just say \"Oh sure thats a perfect plan. You can come tomorrow and pick her up and take her home. I am sure she will be much more comfortable there, then at my place. Why didnt you offer this before knowing how small my place was and knowing that conflicts would happen? But yeah go ahead and pick her up, because if she continues to disturb my work, well idk how long she can stay in this house in general.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/EVIKLuYTkF): **March 11, 2025 (next day)**\n\nFirst of all, I wanna thank you guys for the overwhelming support! This blew up way beyond anything I expected. Wow! I really appreciate you all for taking the time to chime in and sharing your opinion, you guys really helped reassure me and gave me confidence in my own feelings that my private space has been disrespected (and quite frankly, violated).\n\nI would like to answer a few common questions I saw in the comments:\n\n* The guest bed is in the living room. It's stored in the second bedroom (my office), but whenever I have a guest I set it up in the living room. The living room space is quite big and can comfortably fit the guest bed, couch and living room table as well.\n\n* My parents live 4.5-hour drive away and they are the closest family members to my apartment, that is why I didn't initially think of suggesting anyone to come and pick up Lily to take her to their place.\n\n* I, infact, **did NOT** get my sister pregnant (WTF guys! LOL).\n\n* Lily is moving out of her current apartment because it is being sold, and the new owners aren't sure if they want to keep renting it, or what to charge exactly. So that's why she is moving out.\n\n**Anyways, here is the update:** My mother made the drive over yesterday. She came in quite furious, barely said a word to me, and wanted to just take Lily and leave ASAP.\n\nShe had that cold, disappointed look on her face. It broke my heart honestly.\n\nI told them (Lily and my mother) that I wanted to talk and explain my side of the story. I told them both that I didn't want them to leave on bad terms.\n\nI sat them down in the living room, and explained my side of things. I also decided to show them the original post, and it did help calm them down and made them second-guess their opinions. Also I did believe they were quite embarassed (judging by the looks on their face when I showed them the post) to see everything written out like that, but they didn't dare to say a word about it lol.\n\nIn the end, they both agreed that my apartment is my personal space (and also my workplace), and they understood why it was difficult for me to give up my bed.\n\nIt wasn't totally smooth though, they still gave me a bit of a hard time, saying that while they do understand my side now, I could've still been the bigger person and just let Lily sleep in my bed. At least they did drop the whole \"you're selfish\" act.\n\nAs for the rest of the family, I demanded that my sister called each and every one of them to let them know my side and calm them down. Lily was reluctant at first, but my mother gave her \"the look\" and eventually she came around and told me she'd do it on the drive back to my parents'.\n\nI was honestly surprised she agreed. My aunt even called me today to apologize, that was... definitely unexpected and very satisfying haha.\n\nLily is now staying with my parents. And honestly? I wouldn't be surprised if I get a in a few weeks with them ranting about her being entitled in their house haha. Can't wait to see how they'll hande that one.\n\nHopefully, this is the last time I'll have to deal with this. Lily still needs to move her stuff from her old apartment (which is a 30-minute drive from me), so I know she's going to ask for my help. Not that I would mind, I would be happy to help her, but I'm worried she'll might want to come stay at my place again or use my place to store some of her stuff.. Also she might bring this whole thing up again and I couldn't be arsed to deal with it once again.. Ahh that's a problem for another day, though (hopefully not hahaha).\n\nSo in the end, I believe it turned out the best way possible, and I have you guys to thank for that!\n\nSeriously, I appreciate each and every one of you who took their time to comment on my original post.\n\nThank you!\n\n**Top Comments**\n\n**Commenter 1:** So naturally your sister will be sleeping in your parents bed right? You know since Mom doesn\u2019t think its a big deal?\n\nOk all kidding aside you handled this perfectly, you were NTA then and you\u2019re still NTA\n\n**Commenter 2:** Amazing how busy work is going to be for the foreseeable future and all the tight deadlines you have (and get a coworker to back you up) but you can ask if anyone knows a good moving company.\n\nOr just dodge her calls and after she\u2019s moved tell her you needed a break from her after all the drama she caused you. Warm your dad you\u2019re going to do this so he can get ready to handle it on his end.\n\nMost importantly remember you don\u2019t owe her a thing right now, the way she treated you isn\u2019t how you treat family you value when they are doing you a favor, and also what kind of idiot moves out but doesn\u2019t move their stuff? Talk about a preventable problem.\n\nAlso check your lease for any limits on how long guests can stay!\n\n**Commenter 3:** Still NTA! I\u2019m so glad you spoke to them and got the story straight.\n\nThey sound like they think you\u2019re still in the wrong. I honestly would take a big step back from Lily and anyone who was disrespectful to you.\n\nDon\u2019t help Lily move. She needs to figure it out on her own. You were nice enough to her and she tried to take advantage of you. You\u2019ll end up doing all the work if you help her move. Let your parents and all your disrespectful relatives do it. Let her hire movers. If she calls and asks, either ignore her calls or tell her you\u2019re busy. You don\u2019t have to explain further.\n\nDon\u2019t let her store any of her stuff at your place either. She can rent a storage unit. Don\u2019t pay for anything either. If she can\u2019t afford it, she can ask mommy or the other people she called.\n\nLet her know she burned that bridge. Take care of your own peace now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs \u2013 BoRU Rule #7**\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP**",

Not without extremely careful evaluation of their character!!!\n\n\nIt's much much much harder to make them leave once they move in! This is made even worse if you live in a pro tenant city. People abuse squatter right and it can be such a nightmare to kick them out.\u00a0\n\n\nIf the sister was acting so entitled, there must've been warning signs even way before this. OOPs first mistake was agreeing to let her move in.",
