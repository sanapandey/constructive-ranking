The people at this event were all close friends of his from his contract job and I barely know these people. Everything was going fine and my bf was clearly having a great time. But at some point, I was telling a story from my school days when my bf interrupted and said \u201cYou know, \\[my name\\] is prettiest when she shuts up.\u201d\n\nEveryone laughed and my bf just kept going saying \u201cYou guys don\u2019t know what I go through. She never stops talking. Istg sometimes I tune her out for my own sanity\" or something along those lines.\n\nI'm usually really introverted but when I warm up to someone, I'm the type to talk a lot. So when he said these words, I felt SO embarrassed and humiliated, especially since he said it so casually in front of people I don't even know.\n\nI tried to brush it off but I got quiet after that. Later after the party was over, I told him how hurtful his comment was. He rolled his eyes and said I was being too sensitive and that it was just a joke and I was making a big deal out of nothing.\n\nHe said I embarrassed him by acting cold for the rest of the night and that I should learn to take a joke. He also told me if I couldn\u2019t learn to lighten up, maybe I shouldn\u2019t come to events with his friends anymore, even though he was the one who asked me to come in the first place.\n\nI feel so awful and confused. Am I in the wrong for getting upset and killing the vibe? Ps: throwaway as my main has some personal info\n\n**TOP COMMENTS**\n\n**zucheenee**\n\n>NOR, your bf straight up doesn't like you. If he feels so emboldened to insult you in front of his friends, this behavior will only get worse.\n\n**~**\n\n**UFC_Ring_Girl**\n\n>He sounds like a fuckwit\n\n**&**\n\n>>So do his friends\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/aWa16pAnG0)  **March 11, 2025**\n\nI broke up with him. We had been dating for 2 years and it was the first time he'd acted that way, so I was genuinely conflicted and I wasn't sure if the 'joke' really flew over my head. But I decided to leave. It takes me a lot of effort to come out of my shell, and I feel uncomfortable to stay with someone who doesn't like that. My self-esteem is usually real low but this time I spoke up for myself once in a longgg time.\n\nWe broke up over text. It sucked since he kept bringing up all his contract job friends over me again and again. These are people he acquainted with less than 7 months ago, so that alone told me some things. Ig I won't be missing anything since he ended our text with \"bye idgaf.\"\n\nThanks for all the sweet comments. At the time I wrote the post, I was feeling a lot down and cried a lot. I'm a bit sensitive so I teared up reading some comments. Thanks again. I hope everyone has a nice day <3\n\n**TOP COMMENTS**\n\n**Away-Elephant-4323**\n\n>Proud of you girl! Go get yourself some food and flowers and enjoy a movie, self care and happiness is best! \u2764\ufe0f.\n\n**~**\n\n**Flynn_JM**\n\n>I foresee him begging you for forgiveness in the near future when he realizes his work friends don't really give af about him longterm.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**",

Unlike the OP though, my husband (and the good boyfriends I had before him) is happy when I get chatty with his friends and is endlessly proud when I connect. He\u2019s very much \u2018isn\u2019t my wife cool\u2019 and will prompt those connections by bragging about me to his friends when he knows their interests/hobbies/expertise align with mine. \n\nI\u2019m glad OP left that piece of shit.

I guess he didn't think I'd have the nerve to be the one to walk away. \n\nLooking back I feel like he's one of those guys that just doesn't like women in general other than getting a few specific things out of us, and was just pretending to be a certain person until I was stuck in a situation with him, then decided he didn't have to be that person anymore. Which of course he didn't, but I wasn't obligated to be around him either if all he ever wanted was to be rude. \n\nI can't believe now that I put up with it at all, I value my peace and quiet so much.",

The comment above is extremely limited in scope. For anyone who needs to hear it:\n\n**You do not need a man or a woman to be complete. You can live a perfectly happy, fulfilled life without a romantic partner. This has been true since the beginning of humanity and is true now as well. It is possible to live a HAPPIER life alone than with a partner, especially if that partner is there specifically because you are afraid of being alone or afraid of missing out.**\n\nSometimes I actually feel sorry for people who think that a person hasn\u2019t properly lived unless they have a great love. As I said above: that\u2019s an extremely limited viewpoint and actually does a disservice to us all when it\u2019s put forward as the only viewpoint.",

It\u2019s rare for someone so publicly blatant to go two entire years without abusing his gf, and then immediately start with public abuse (that usually takes some grooming and warm-up period for the abuser to feel secure enough to publicly humiliate their partner), so I doubt this is the first time.
