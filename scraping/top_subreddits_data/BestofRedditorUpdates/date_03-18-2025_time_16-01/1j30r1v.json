Same with my wooden spoons.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen I cook, I don't look then I grab things. I trust they are in their place. If I grab a knife or spoon and it's the wrong one or not there or no longer sharp, it can throw off everything.\u00a0\n\n\nStarters are the same. They need to be babied and taken care of.

The text of the post has been preserved below.**\n\n**---**\n\n*Throwaway Account*\n\n>I (50m) found out that my wife (49f) was having an affair with a man in his 30s. I was crushed and started the divorce process. We have four children (25f 23m 21m 20f) together and since all the children are legal adults I intend to wash my hands of this woman completely, and only see or talk to her at events that involve our children. My wife doesn't want a divorce and is begging for us to go to therapy, but I have refused. She has broken my trust in one of the worst ways and I don't want to spend the rest of my life with doubt.\n\n>I know that this would be hard on our children but I didn't expect my oldest child Chrissy (25f) to be so against the divorce and insist that I work thing out with her mother \"for the good of the family.\" They all know why I'm divorcing their mother. I told my daughter that my decision is firm and I've tried to talk to my daughter about my perspective and that I would never expect her to choose between us, but she didn't want to hear it. Chrissy was very upset and I tried to recommend therapy to help her process and coupe but she insisted that there wouldn't be a need for her to go to counseling if I didn't divorce her mother. I felt like Chrissy was trying to pressure me into staying, which I didn't think was fair and decided to go LC with her until the divorce was finalized.\n\n>Whenever I did talk to my daughter she was always sobbing and would beg/demand that I speak to her mom, I've stopped any direct communication without the involvement of my lawyer, and reminded her of that. It got so bad that I decided to just go NC for about a month. I spoke to Chrissy two days before her sister's birthday through a text and asked her not to bring up the divorce since that day. I did the same with my wife and I got no response from either of them.\n\n>In the beginning everything was a little awkward but I thought it was going okay until my wife gave a passive-aggressive speech about family being together for important events. One of my sons called her out and Chrissy defended her. My youngest daughter, sick of her Chrissy's ways, revealed that the only reason she was on my wife's side was because she knew about the affair before I did and even helped my wife cover it up. I was devastated.\n\n>Apparently, after I filed, my wife accidentally sent a text to the wrong child confirming that Chrissy had indeed known about the affair for months and would cover for her. The rest of my children talked about it and decided to stay out of it, which I don't hold against them, but my youngest daughter was so sick of Chrissy and my wife making her birthday about them that she blurted it out in the heat of the moment.\n\n>Since then I have assured the rest of my children that I will always be their dad and love them, but I have been NC with Chrissy since the birthday event. Right now I am shutting down all of her attempts to talk to me because I am just too upset. Some days I feel like what Chrissy did was worse than what my wife did and I'm not sure I want a relationship with her in the foreseeable future. What should I do?",

Make the physical effort to meet them, to keep in contact, and make multiple decisions regarding how they'll hide the affair. You can't make dozens of consecutive mistakes!!

Stretching your boundaries together to make sure they can take further stretching and not breaking.\n\n\nShe could have probably gotten to the point that she could have been allowed some casual sex here and there, and he would have been okay with it.

However, this was one of the few details he provides of her personal appearance. I suspect he included this in part to show how far she had changed since he knew her in college, but also to tell us -- either consciously or unconsciously -- that she *had* become a Stepford Wife. That the woman he knew in college no longer existed, if she ever did.\n\nFrom his description of Olivia, I'm sure he thinks she is a good woman. At least as much as any 20-something can be.

They build a wall around the neighbourhood, and a guard post at the gate that has to be on OP's land. Because of property law or building something nearby, he can insist they remove it, so either they make accommodations to OP and keep paying him for it, or the HOA is failing its own regulations and has to be dissolved. In settling the case, OP adds exaggerated demands to his suit and expects to bargain them down, but the HOA president has been broken by the whole affair and simply signs, apparently without reading the document.",

The mom being a mentor to **a** bully would be one thing, but to mentor **her son's** bully should never have been allowed.\n\nA third thought that occurred to me after being reminded of this story here:  adding to the conflict of interest thought, what if instead of whatever savior complex mom seemed to have this had gone the other way and mom took her son's bully as a protege for the purpose of screwing his future to get back over the treatment of her son. Whatever the bully had done that would be an unconscionable abuse of power.",

Or may have been allergic to certain light? Her son loved to play board games and play online video games with his friends.\n\n\nThe dad was not involved and pretty much inferred that his son was a mama's boy. He was not involved with the parenting but believed it was his right to have a say.\n\n\nIt was so sad. The son only had one good parent, which is something that I can relate to.\n\n\nI just remember the mom posting and asking if she was a bad mom, and the comments tore her ex several new assholes. >:3",

They got divorced and even thought their teenage daughter knew the reason of their divorced, she took the side of OP, blamed her father for destruction of the family and treat him like shit. Years later, OP remarries and daughter still is awful to her father to the point of calling the step-parent \"dad\" and her father by his name in front of the father. When the daughter had her 21 (or 23) birthday, the father give her a gift, she still treats him like shit, but he had enough and said her will be out of her life. She didnt care by that, but 5 years later the daughter deeply regrets her actions and now that she's going to marry, she would like her father to walk down the aisle, but he totally cut contact and changed his number. None of his family gives information about his werabouts, but OP found her ex FB page through one of his counsin and she discovers that her ex is now married and have a son. When OP DM'd her ex, he responded to leave him alone. Now shes asking if she should tell the truth to her daughter or not, because the truth would devasted her;\n\n2. I think it's from r/marriage. OP is tired of her husband constantly sexualise her, because he wants to have sex almost every day, he grabs her butt and gets erect every time they hug and kiss. So one day when he approachs her, she rejects and berates him, by saying that she feel disgusted when he touches her. After that, the husband stoped every form of affection: he doesn't kiss, hug, look for sex or touches. This prolongs for 6 months (I think?) and when OP confronted her husband, he talks about one of his work trip some random woman flirted with him and how that made him feel desired in a long time, so she responded by asking him if he cheated on her. He gets angry, says he's thinking about divorce and now OP is desperate to save her marriage.",

The whole \"he got an erection!\" Huh? That is a basic biological response, one that all guys experience and most guys are self-conscious about. OOP called it \"disgusting,\" and that's a lethal attack in any relationship. Imagine him saying to OOP, \"Gross, every time the temperature drops, I can see your nipples through your shirt--that's *disgusting*.\" How's that going to work for intimacy? And OOP says flat out that he never acted upon getting an erection, so it's not like he was being inappropriate. \n\nPlus, she actively admits that this was the tip of the spear. She didn't try to sit down and discuss this with him after she cooled off, but doubled down on ignorance of basic male biology and snarked at him in an accusatory manner. She admits that she never complimented him, admits she became irritated he didn't initiate anything after scolding him for initiating, and admits she took him for granted. And when he explains that the fact that a woman flirting with him caused an epiphany about how unhappy he was, she went nuclear and accused him of having an affair, completely and conveniently minimizing everything she's done to alienate his affections for the past 6 months.  \n\nPlus as a bonus round, in the edit she now claims that she's willing to \"make every imaginable compromise\" on this subject. \"Compromise?\" Maybe on the original argument, but how is she going to \"compromise\" on the 6 months of high-minded nastiness, coldness and distain that's left him running for the door?\n\n*That's* why she has to grovel.",

She didn't put it in terms of her wanting this and him wanting that, in which case you can compromise and set boundaries while respecting each others desires even if you don't always oblige, she put it in terms of him being disgusting (it also seems like she made it about him getting an erection rather in terms of him slapping her butt too much). If she had a track record of giving compliments or showing her affection, he might have been able to shrug it off as a momentary lapse, but unfortunately that isn't the case.\n\nThat being said, it seems like he didn't really engage in trying to repair the relationship much after she hurt him. Ideally you should mention, \"I'm frustrated because I'm not feeling desired,\" before you say \"this girl made me feel so good because I felt desired\"",

She doesn't understand that no, he can't just not get an erection when they cuddle, that's like asking her to delay her period because it's inconvenient for him.\n\nIf the argument was over him being too touchy and he refused to stop, that would be different. That part is glossed over enough that I can't really say anything either way. Her focus is entirely on his erections. Calling him disgusting for normal bodily function is a big problem, and it's no surprise he's withdrawn from her. He clearly does not feel comfortable with her, and his mention of another woman flirting with him is pointing out that if a stranger makes him feel better about himself than she is willing to, maybe the marriage has no future.\n\nI don't think groveling is the thing she needs to do, that's too easy. What she needs to do is spend the time and effort to educate herself about physiological reactions, or have the decency to accept a divorce without throwing a fit.",

She clearly doesn't. That's not something you can really change.

I know there are a few of those, but in this particular one, OP owns the house and I think he marvels that when the roommate moved in, his kitchen became full of ingredients he didn't even recognize. Roommate is a good cook/foodie and I think OP mentions multiple types of cooking oil or salt or something. Roommate may have even started a garden, but I'm not too sure about that detail. (EDIT: I found it, turns out they both already knew they were gay https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/s/aHeqaULzpB)\n\nOh and there's another post, I think they're both male teens, and they've been besties forever, and OP has started to feel like it might be more? The very specific thing I remember is that one of them is really into fossils and gives the other coprolites (fossilized poop) and it's very sweet and wholesome\n\nAlso, a list of these \"oops guess I'm not straight after all\" posts would be fun, so feel free to drop similar links here \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\n\nPlease and thank you!\n\n\nEDIT: A few posts to start with\u2014\n\n1.

A recurring theme was prettier golden child sister slept with OOP's husband, and everyone expected OOP to just get over it and be happy that her sister and ex found true love.\n\nOn their own, they were kind of a stretch, but the fact that several came out around the same time using the same Cassie reference blew away all credibility.\n\nThere was another one a few years ago where OOP (20s, M) brings his fiance to a huge family gathering, like Thanksgiving or something, and the family took it upon themselves to haze and abuse OOP's fiance, much to OOP's indifference. Shortly after that, there was a copycat post where another OOP brought his fiancee to Thanksgiving, but they didn't have enough chairs so the fiancee wasn't allowed to sit the entire time. Commenters asked why nobody asked to borrow chairs from a neighbor, buy more chairs at the store, or even bring chairs from another room, to which OOP replied that nobody had thought of any of those options.
