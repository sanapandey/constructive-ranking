He was going to be in my town from last Wednesday until Saturday evening. So we made plans to go clubbing on Friday night with some friends of mine. We hung out and came home around 4 and I only have one bed in my apartment so my brother crashed on my couch.\n\n\nWe both woke up a few hours later, grabbed lunch and went to the airport and my brother headed back over to where he lives. After that he sent me a text when his flight got in safely and that was it.\n\n\nNow my boyfriend and I don't live together but I stay at his place quite often or he'll stay at mine. He usually works, 2 weeks in, 2 weeks out and he came home yesterday morning so naturally I was pretty excited to see him. I picked him up and we came back to my place. Afterward,while chatting, I mentioned that my brother spent the night at my place and he got kind of weird.\n\n\n\nI kind of prodded him to tell me what was up because for the life of me I couldn't figure what would cause him to go so quiet and sullen when just 5 minutes before we were having a flowing conversation. He told me it was nothing so I left it and then later I asked him again because he was still in a bad mood. He said that he didn't like the idea of another man staying at my place regardless of who it is. And that it will not be happening in future. \n\n\nI got really confused here because it's my brother, sleeping on my couch for one night after we hung out ? It's not some stranger or hell, even a guy friend of ours. It's my brother. I laughed it off and said you can't be serious, you have to be joking and he got really angry and left my place.\n\n\nLast night I got an 'angry' text saying that as his girlfriend I have to respect his wishes and while I get respecting what your SO wants, compromise, the works, isn't this ridiculous? I responded asking him why my brother sleeping on my couch was so bad and he said it just was and that a proper girlfriend doesn't let other men stay over alone with her and that it's incredibly disrespectful to him. More confusion from me because again, this isn't some dude I brought home, it's my BROTHER.\n\nI tried talking to him after this but I got a message saying we'll talk when he's composed himself.\n\n\nWhat am I to do? I really love my boyfriend but this is just confusing and I don't know how to react.\n\n\n\nAlso, I should note I've never had any other guys alone at my place, literally only my boyfriend (apart from my brother) has ever been with me alone there, the only other time guys have been there have been if I have a small group get together and that is quite rare.\n\n\n\n**Tl;dr brother from out of town slept on my couch after we went clubbing, bf came home yesterday and got very angry when I told him about it**\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**thisishowiinternet**\n\n>If your boyfriend is mad about your _brother_ crashing on your couch after late night clubbing, he's got his priorities all wrong.  \n\n>I'd like to know why he's so upset over your brother staying, another man, sure that'd be understandable, but it's interesting he's angry about family staying in your apartment.  \n\n**OOP**\n\n>>I don't even know why, I've asked him that several times and all he says is that he doesn't like me having other men over and it's very disrespectful to him.\n\n**thisishowiinternet**\n\n>>>\"Disrespectful to him\"  \n\n>>>Had he considered how disrespectful he is to you by trying to tell you that you can't have family at your own apartment?  \n\n>>>Personally, i'd be out of that relationship/situation, i'm not down with people trying to tell me who i can and cannot be around, if they're family.  \n\n>>>Or there needs to be a conversation about what boundaries he's allowed to set and the expectations of him\n\n\nEdit:- \n\n\nOkay, so my boyfriend and I have been texting the past hour or so, he sent me a hey and I was kind of in a pissy mood after he brushed me off last night so I simply replied with are you ready to talk?\n\n\nHe replied okay and so I asked him what the deal was with my brother sleeping on the couch, he's not some random guy from a bar, he's not even a guy 'friend', he's more than that, he's my brother, I grew up with him, there is absolutely no reason for him to worry or freak out in that situation because, it's my brother of all people, there is literally nothing threatening in that situation, not physically towards me or to our relationship\n\n\nHis response: I, just am not comfortable with that, I know it's your brother but I think there are boundaries that should be in place, why didn't he got back to the friend's place he stayed at on Wednesday and Thursday?\n\n\nMy response: you're not answering my question and just telling me what you told me last night me, also, my apartment was closer to the club than his friend's place\n\n\nHim: We've been together for some time now and I think that as a couple, it looks bad when you let other guys stay over regardless of who they are to you, I would never do something to you like that and I think it's only fair that you reciprocate that, it's hard to explain things because I know you can't see them from my perspective\n\n*Him cont'd:* you shouldn't really need other guys so close with you, why couldn't you just put your brother in a cab and send him on his way just like we'd normally do with all our other friends, anyway I have a meeting now I'll talk to you later, enjoy your day babe, bye\n\n\n\nEdit2: **Ughhyejxoslspfh everyone I don't even know how the hell to react right now, this is the first time he's ever acted like this. He's met my brother before and they've always gotten along well**\n\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/OHSGF6caHi)  **Feb 4, 2016 (17 days later)**\n\n\nSo against better judgement, I did not immediately break up with my boyfriend. I tried convincing myself it was a one time thing, maybe he was just having a rough patch and I tried pushing it down. I did tell my brother what happened and he replied saying, he'd always thought my boyfriend and him were cool with each other at the very least. He then told me my boyfriend is being nuts and if I need to crash for a few days I could come on up to his end. \n\n\n\nSo the rest of the week remained tense with my boyfriend but closer to the weekend, it was relaxed (ish) we went on a date, hung out with some friends at a bar together and yet for the life of me I couldn't figure out reasons for his outburst. \n\n\nSo on Sunday I asked him again, now that you seem in a better mood, would it be so bad if I asked what was up last week? And once again mood went from friendly and relaxed to arctic. He simply asked me if I had to keep bringing up bullshit when we were doing okay again. \n\n\nI got pretty angry at him and told him to leave my apartment. Since Sunday I've been stewing and just looking back at our relationship, sure I have my friends, but we hang with them much less, the ones we do hang out with are more his friends and people that he is cool with being with. It was rough but looking back on it, I started seeing controlling behaviour from him that I'd never taken up on due to either just being head over heels and willing to compromise on everything and by compromise I mean roll over and give up.\n\n\nWe talked last night and I gave him an ultimatum, something I never expected to give in any relationship, either you sit and try to talk this out with me like a rational person, no bullshit answers and no dodging questions or we break up. Instead of having a conversation, he broke down and started telling me I was the best thing he's ever had and that he has issues that he can't even begin to explain and that he doesn't want to lose me.\n\n\nNow, I'm sorry if this is the part that makes me seem like a bitch but it wasn't the answer I wanted or deserved, not when I'd been the one rolling over and giving him whatever throughout our entire relationship so I told him that it was best if we didn't see each other anymore and that he should leave my apartment. \n\n\n\nHe left and spent almost 2 hours just sitting in his car in front my place before leaving when it was close to 12.\n\n\nSo, yeah, we broke up. I admit I feel more saddened than relieved so I'm hoping I don't do something stupid like drunk dial him or call him over because I'm lonely or something like that.\n\n\nBut yeah, we're not together anymore, it sucks but it had to be done.\n\n\nTL;DR we broke up after me realizing he'd been subtly controlling from early on and him not taking the one chance I'd given him to talk things out\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**beer-N-crumpets**\n\n>I don't think you were being a bitch- I think you opted out of being manipulated. He was trying to pull your strings and you didn't let him, which *I* think was a solid choice. Well done!\n\n**epichuntarz**\n\n>>Right on the nose.  \n\n>>He was going to tell OP what she wanted to hear so she'd stay with him.  And he'd never actually change.  \n\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**",

They still know that *they* wouldn\u2019t want to be treated the way they are treating their victim. They know what they\u2019re doing is harmful, they just believe the victim deserves harm. \n\nEven when it\u2019s not coming from a cold, calculated place, the overwhelming emotions that drive the person to act are accompanied by an underlying deeply held belief that the other person is inferior in some way and therefore deserving of pain or punishment or restricted agency. \n\nMaking an active choice to abuse someone isn\u2019t the same thing as consciously planning or calculating abuse - take the classic example from Why Does He Do That? of the person who breaks things in anger, but always his partner\u2019s things. Is he thinking \u201cI will have an outburst of rage and make sure to only break her things so she feels scared of me?\u201d Usually no. He\u2019s usually thinking very emotionally - e.g. \u201cI hate you for making me feel this way, fuck you, fuck all this shit.\u201d But he\u2019s still making the active choice to abuse his partner because some part of him is driving him to not break his own stuff, even as his immediate train of thought is just \u201cI\u2019m so angry and I want to break things\u201d. \n\nWhat I was getting at with my initial comment is that it lets people off the hook a little when we say it\u2019s just selfishness/insecurity/general shittiness, and it\u2019s only a deliberate choice when it\u2019s cold and calculated. It can be both emotionally motivated and not fully thought through, and an active choice to harm. \n\nSimple selfishness is not considering your partner\u2019s feelings, and focusing solely on your own. Feeling good when your partner feels bad is something different. Combined with selfishness you get the desire to harm your partner.  It\u2019s the same with insecurity - simple insecurity might mean you are irrationally upset with your partner, but that doesn\u2019t inherently mean you have the desire to punish your partner when you feel insecure. You can display both selfishness and insecurity without also having the belief in your partner\u2019s inferiority and the belief that you have a \u201cright\u201d to hurt them. Lots of people hold that additional belief without consciously thinking about it in those terms - they may even convince themselves they\u2019re not hurting their partner. But deep down they do know what they\u2019re doing in general, even if they couldn\u2019t articulate it to someone else or even themselves.",

Although it's definitely not out of the ordinary for abusers to have more self-awareness than we sometimes give them credit for. In group therapy sessions for domestic abusers, for instance, they can often articulate a lot of benefits they get from the abusive behaviour. \n\nIt's probably something in the middle for many abusers: they initially do something because of problems with emotional regulation, but when they like the results of their actions, they take note of how they got that outcome.\n\nBut the fact that so many abusers *do* wind up making stupid mistakes that wind up losing them control does indicate that their impulses and emotional needs are in the driving seat at least some of the time.",

It reminds me of a study that was done where people drew cards from two stacks, and they got prizes based on what cards they randomly got. One of the two stacks was more likely to have \u201cgood\u201d cards, but the participants weren\u2019t told that, and it was subtle enough that you couldn\u2019t tell right away. \n\nParticipants started subconsciously choosing from the \u201cgood\u201d deck long before they felt a conscious difference. And there was a conscious feeling that one was \u201cbetter\u201d before they could articulate why/how it was better. In other words, the human brain could determine that something worked a long time before the conscious mind could recognize it\u2014recognize it and act on it.\n\nSo I could totally believe that an abuser could start doing manipulative things because they \u201cfeel right\u201d (in terms of controlling their partner) without any conscious understanding that that was what they were doing. All they need is to subconsciously recognize that they\u2019re getting \u201cgood\u201d results (successfully controlling their partner) from manipulation in order to keep doing it. No conscious choice needed.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t absolve them. Without the inherent belief that they are entitled to manipulate and control their partner, that control of their partner to get them to act against their own best interests is positive and desirable, their brain wouldn\u2019t interpret it as \u201cgood.\u201d That underlying belief of superiority and entitlement is still necessary. But the actions can, as you say, evolve from that belief without them consciously calculating \u201cif I do this, I will erode her autonomy in this particular way, which will enhance my control of her.\u201d",

I did not realize it at the time, although I would say that I knew not everyone would agree with every position I had that led to some of the behaviors that were problematic. I wish I had found a good therapist earlier.\n\n\nSo I don't want to dive in to a ton of details, but here's what I'd say for me, and only me. This is a bit long-winded, but I would have killed to read what I'm writing long before I learned it.\n\n\nI consider the behavior I had in the past to have been abusive.  I never hit anyone, I never had some master plan to manipulate and control, I wasn't consciously being mean or trying to hurt anyone.  What I did have was a bunch of fucked up perspectives, poor emotional regulation, and poor empathy skills. The thing is that I never considered myself abusive because what I was doing didn't feel like what I thought being abusive would feel like (again, poor empathy skills).\n\n\nI've spent a fuckload of time and money on couples and personal counseling to come to these realizations. Some people won't ever have them. When we went to couples counseling, I knew I loved my partner and that I wasn't going to be the person who was like \"My marriage counselor was just out to get me\" so I went in with a mindset of  openness.  If I'm told my actions are harmful, I may have spoken up to try to explain, but I was willing to hold their judgement in higher regard than my own.  And I thought long and hard after every brutal session.  Coming to terms with the fact that you were doing things that made you a bad person was crushing. Choosing to move\n\n\nAnyhow, my SO and I are happy now but we all still have shortcomings that we can work on. I'm still in therapy.  I still listen to my therapist from the position of \"What I have been doing up until now hasn't worked, why not give someone else some input\".  It's slow. I'm a better person now, and I'll be a better person than this next week hopefully.",

My brother saw the clean laundry basket and decided to play a game. He put my bra on his head like a helmet and started throwing socks at people. He got really into it, diving behind the couch to dodge socks that were being thrown back. \n\nMy partner thought it was hilarious and joined in. I'd been worried initially because a man I'm not actually related to was wearing my bra and running around the apartment. A man who's not totally secure would have issues with that. But my partner just joined in the fun and later told me he was happy I had people I was so close to.

How can you,\u00a0 a real person, not be enough for an accessory? You must need to make yourself look bigger, but it's so much easier to just make her look smaller.
