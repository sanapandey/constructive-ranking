OOP is u/Calm_Bid7851\n\nOriginally posted to r/Ratschlag\n\nTrigger warning: >!sexual harassment!<\n\n**Posts were translated from German to English.**\n\n[Colleague Harasses My Sister at Carnival](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ratschlag/comments/1j20sz3/kollege_bedr%C3%A4ngt_meine_schwester_an_karneval/) March 2, 2025\n\nWhat the title says...\n\nA good friend of mine, who I also work with, harassed my sister at a party yesterday.\n\nI was actually there with her, along with some of my friends and hers. At some point, we split up, I figured she\u2019s not a kid anymore, and she was with people I trust. That was a mistake.\n\nAt some point, she called me and asked where I was and when I could take her home. I went to her & I asked if everything was okay because she seemed really nervous and just off.\n\nShe then told me that \\[my colleague\\] was being 'disgusting' toward her, he hit on her, said things like 'Don't be so prude, just let me touch you', touched her by the waist (slightly pulled at the laces of her dress) and even pulled her away from the others, despite her repeatedly saying she didn\u2019t want that. He only left when one of her friends showed up.\n\nI was honestly speechless. This guy is a good colleague of mine, and man\u2026 seriously, my sister?\n\nI\u2019ve been feeling guilty all day & don\u2019t even dare to bring it up with her again. Honestly, I also feel like she didn\u2019t tell me everything, maybe because he\u2019s a good friend of mine. But I don\u2019t want to pressure her into telling our parents and I should have protected her in the first place, and I messed up.\n\nI really don\u2019t feel like working with him on Tuesday. Should I confront him? To be honest, I\u2019d rather make him feel what I think of him. He might not even remember. And he was a really good colleague of mine.\n\nHow should I deal with him? And should I talk to my sister again?\n\nBy the way my sister is 19, and the guy and I are 22.\n\nThanks for your advice!\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ratschlag/comments/1j62l77/update_kollege_bedr%C3%A4ngt_meine_schwester_an/) March 7, 2025\n\nUpdate because some people asked. My sister was sexually harassed by a friend of mine during Carnival while I was away for a short time.\n\nI have since spoken to my superior, and preliminary investigations for a possible disciplinary procedure have been initiated.\n\nI also had a conversation with my friend after duty\u00a0\u2013\u00a0if you can even call it that. It got pretty rough. I confronted him directly, and as expected, he denied everything. \u201cShe actually wanted it\u201d & \u201cShe never really said no,\u201d etc. Today, he also started talking about loyalty within the brotherhood, probably to make me keep my mouth shut. But he completely shot himself in the foot, and hopefully, the disciplinary procedure will go through.\n\nMy sister is doing okay for now, but she opened up again and told me more details. He really cornered her, pressed her chest to chest against a wall, and made it clear that if she didn\u2019t play along, she would really get to know him. That was more than enough information for me.\n\nThat\u2019s why I spoke to my superior in the middle of the week. I had to call in sick on Tuesday so I could calm down and not do anything stupid. I\u2019m struggling a lot with guilt for leaving her alone, and it feels incredibly uncomfortable facing her, knowing that this was one of my closest friends.\n\nThanks again for all your advice and support.\n\n**Reminder - this is a repost.

Ich kann mal schauen, ob ich einen Artikel dazu finde.\n\nEdit: habe leider bisher keinen Artikel zu dem Fall selber gefunden, es gab aber wohl mehrere Vergewaltigungen am gleichen Tag, dabei auch in K\u00f6ln, wo es mehrere F\u00e4lle gab von Frauen die in Dixiklos gezerrt wurden. Und da die Polizei K\u00f6ln f\u00fcr Leverkusen zust\u00e4ndig ist... naja, k\u00f6nnte der Fall etwas untergegangen sein was die Medienpr\u00e4senz betrifft.\n\nAus meiner Erinnerung was ich \u00fcber den Fall geh\u00f6rt habe (von Verwandten, da ich selbst kein Radio h\u00f6re und dort auch nicht mehr wohne):\n\nEin M\u00e4dchen war mit zwei Freundinenn unterwegs und hatte ein T-Shirt mit der Aufschrift \"no means no\" an. Eine Gruppe M\u00e4nner (Anzahl ist mir gerade entfallen) hat sie daraufhin attackiert. Ihre beiden Freundinnen waren es, die die Polizei gerufen haben, aber bis die da waren, war es bereits zu sp\u00e4t. Das M\u00e4dchen wurde nach der Tat in die Psychiatrie eingewiesen. Einer oder mehrere der T\u00e4ter wurden geschnappt. Einer hat die Aussage get\u00e4tigt, dass das T-Shirt ja provokant war und sie es dementsprechend selbst Schuld sei, da das respektlos gegen\u00fcber seiner Kultur sei (oder so \u00e4hnlich, jedenfalls).\n\nWenn ich mich recht entsinne ist das Opfer 16 Jahre alt.",

However, at best I can only empathize but I just cannot understand. I simply do not have the means to go through what a woman goes through. I can only see the effects and not feel it.\n\nBut I do for men. I understand testosterone. I understand how horny our bodies make us. I understand the underlying physical superiority we have over the fairer gender and the constraints needed to handle that. I once mistakenly body checked my own sister that was aimed at my male cousin, something we usually do when celebrating, that sent her flying. I wasn\u2019t even going that hard and if it was my cousin that got it, he\u2019d barely even budge.\n\nMy version of \u201cbrotherhood\u201d aims at keeping fellow men accountable, share methods to cope and understand ourselves to help each other, a place for us to just let it go with fellow people who can empathize AND understand.\n\nBut that\u2019s been bastardized to mean a boy\u2019s club where men can brag how they treat women like objects, a place to share how to get away with cheating, or put down other men for being too \u201cfeminine.\u201d \n\nGuys like that \u201cfriend\u201d are the people why I lost touch with a few friend groups I had over the years and it just sucks.",
