    "selftext": "**I am not The OOP, OOP posted from 2 accounts: u/mfstevenson1 & u/awetsasquatch**\n\n**I got fired from walmart and never worked there**\n\n**Originally posted to r/IDontWorkHereLady**\n\n**Thanks to u/theprismaprincess for suggesting this BoRU**\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/s/ZTHA9T42i0)  **March 31, 2020**\n\nObligatory on mobile, sorry about any formatting issues!\n\nAbout a year ago, I worked selling solar panel systems. This job required me to wear khakis and a blue polo when I was meeting customers. One particular day, after meeting with a homeowner, I had to stop by my local walmart to get more pens and a notepad for my work bag. \n\nI pretty consistently got asked if I worked there by other customers, and I would help if I knew what they were after, but I always told them that I didnt work there, and they were always kind. So this fateful day, I grabbed my pens and paper and checked out in the self checkout section. As I was leaving, I heard someone say behind me \"And just WHERE do you think you're going?\" \n\nNow, a little about me...I try to mind my own business as much as possible, and dont like to get wrapped up in other people's drama. When I hear outbursts like that in public, I assume it's not because of me, I also try to follow the rules as much as possible. In this case, I assume it wasnt me because I paid for everything, so I continue to my car. \n\nRoughly 30 feet from my car I hear again \"Hey you! STOP!\" I do turn around at that one, because that's typically what you say to a thief. An employee who can only be described as a Karen is marching towards me, 8 different kinds of pissed off. She starts reaming into me about how I'm abandoning my shift, and I'm not supposed to get off for another 3 hours. I'm standing there bewildered because I genuinely have no clue what shes talking about, and I try to let her know I dont work there, but she wont let me get a word in. Eventually she says: \"forget it, you're fired!\" I waited about 5 seconds, and told her: \"I dont work here, I've never worked here.\" She stared at me, and muttered \"sorry\" and ran back inside. \n\nI'm still not sure what happened, but that's my tale of being fired from a job I never worked at, hope it brought you some joy!\n\n**TOP COMMENTS**\n\n**phoenixwaller**\n\n>LOL I would TOTALLY have been a bitch at that point, turned the tables and demanded to speak to HER manager.\n\n**Nuggetcloneking**\n\n>>i WaNt tO sPeaK To tHe MaNAGeR\n\n[Fired from Walmart - update](https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/s/Vb3e4vUbgK)  **Nov 19, 2022 (almost 3 years later)**\n\nSo the below text was my story from a couple years back...i now have an update to this story. That being said, it was on an old account so im reposting the story here, with an update at the end.\n\n**Edited out the OG Post**\n\nThe update: I've been banned from that Walmart. \n\nThe manager in the story apparently has a memory like an elephant (kind of looks like one too), and is still working there today. I went in to pick up a couple things and return one thing for my wife. I'm waiting in the return line, and the person in front of me is having some issue with the return, so the employee helping them calls for a manager. It's the same lady - recognized her immediately and as it turns out she recognized me...kind of. She points at me and tells me I'm not allowed to shop at this Walmart and if I don't leave she'll call the police. I asked why I was banned, she said she didn't remember, but she knew I was. So I left. My wife and I have been cackling over this for a couple days and thought you'd find it funny as well!\n\n**TOP COMMENTS**\n\n**Jordangander**\n\n>Contact Walmart Corporate and inform them that she is harassing you and banned you because she was embarrassed for harassing a customer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She has no place being a manager for any company acting like that.\n\n**TheDocJ**\n\n>>If that's how she treats customers, I would lay good money that she treats staff like crap too, I'm sure that they would cheer her departure.\n\n[Final update: She was arrested and fired](https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/s/xvE0ddWArq)  **March 10, 2025 (5 years after the 1st post)**\n\nVery much doubt anyone remembers this, but here's the link to the previous update if anyone happens to care: https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/s/BMp5Pygyt4\n\nShort version to catch people up, I was fired from a Walmart that I didn't work at by a power tripping manager because I apparently looked like someone who worked there. \n\nThe final update is that recently my family moved to a new neighborhood around the corner from the Walmart. After meeting the new neighbors, I find out one worked at this Walmart. I told her the story because I still think it's hilarious, and she let me know that manager (let's name her Gertrude) was arrested and fired. Ol' Gerdie apparently had a history of arbitrarily banning people like she did to me, but nobody really ever complained so nothing ever got done, she was just shifted from department to department. One day late last year she got a little too aggressive with an off duty cop and tried to forcefully remove her from the store, which inevitably led to Gertrude punching the cop. She was arrested and finally fired my neighbor and most of her coworkers have rejoiced. Karma can be a beautiful thing! \n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**Initial-Shop-8863**\n\n>Does that mean you're no longer banned from the store for doing something you didn't do, but it must have been something, because she remembered you even if she couldn't remember what she thought you did?\n\n**OOP**\n\n>>My neighbor informed me my ban has been lifted lol\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**",

Called again, and I see a woman with her children walking up to the front desk holding my phone and wallet. She said someone had left it in the freezer case. I checked and my cards had been taken out and put back in and the cash was missing. A whole $8. I chalked it up as a lesson learned and continued with my list. \n\nAs I'm rounding the corner from the front to go back down the aisles, I hear a woman from the back of the store yelling, \"He stole my purse!\" Another man was chasing him and tackled him from behind right in front of me hitting an end cap and sending cans rolling everywhere. \"He stole my wallet, too!\" \n\nAnyway, he was arrested and I got my $8 back.",

Thieves tend to look for people that are taking their time so that they won\u2019t notice as quickly, and when they do notice the hope is that they\u2019ll be like \u201coh no where\u2019d I leave my purse/wallet\u201d and go back to retrace their steps before figuring they were robbed (may take even longer for them to realize if they find their wallet/purse and don\u2019t check for cards until they get back to the register).\n\nWalmart and similar stores tend to be anchors for shopping centers, which means that if the thief can snatch the cards/cash and move quickly they can leave the main store and hit up multiple other stores in the center to very quickly buy expensive things to resell (good ones will already have this planned out\u2026in OP\u2019s case it sounds like the thief was kinda dumb and went for multiple people in the same place). In my aunt\u2019s case, there were about 20 minutes total between her purse getting emptied out and when she cancelled her cards - in that time, the thief managed to buy $5K of jewelry and $2K of electronics at shops in the same shopping center. Never got caught either, though cameras weren\u2019t as good in the 00\u2019s.",

I think that\u2019s what the vests are for, no employee would be just wearing a blue polo. If you forgot your vest, you have to wear a yellow safety vest. Even team leads wear vests.\n\nEdit: also even in 2020, Walmart did not require khakis in the dress code. Slacks of any color, jeans of any color, even skirts and fancy colorful pants, as long as they went to your ankle and didn\u2019t have any rips.\n\nEdit: also also. Only one tier of Walmart management is allowed to ban or trespass, loss prevention, they don\u2019t wear uniforms because they are supposed to look like regular shoppers. The only time someone at Walmart can ban or trespass you is if it\u2019s loss prevention and they\u2019re gonna be calling the cops to do it.\n\nEdit: also also also. The only one who can fire you is your team lead or a coach. And they have to bring you into a secure room with a witness, tell you why you are being fired, show you the paperwork and have you sign it.",

It took up a decent chunk of my upper arm and, because I didn't mess with it, it formed a huge unbroken scab. When it was healed enough that it didn't need to be covered but still had the huge scab, my mom took me with her to Walmart. While we were there, my scab came off and floated to the floor like a feather, remaining completely intact the entire time. That's the kind of weird shit that happens at Walmart.",

She got disturbingly chatty with minimal prompting.\n\nShe just needed all the treatment for all the things.  Starting with, it turns out, apparently long-diagnosed schizophrenia and bipolar.  \n\nShe had true delusions, she Really Thought she was actually an FBI agent collecting absolutely vital information.  Also thought various things about objects surveilling her, plots against her by \u201cThem,\u201d and so on.  \u201cThey\u201d told her to keep the handprints and notes she took about nonsense things secret from the Devices surveilling her.  Her coworkers were Devices, btw.  But not management for some reason - maybe because coworkers wore uniform shirts and management didn\u2019t? Which explains why she only did it outside of other floor staff\u2019s view.\n\nLuckily, she said some things during her deliberately low key discussion with management that let them reasonably justify reaching out to her emergency contact as a threat to herself.  She wasn\u2019t eating or drinking properly because They had tainted a wide variety of food and drinks.\n\nThey recorded the interview in case they\u2019d have to try to get her taken in to custody on a psych hold.  But her emergency contact turned out to be a local family member that she trusted enough to go with and get help.  \n\nI talked to the person who hired her as part of our review of what happened - she interviewed well!  He got three good previous-employer references from a couple months old to a few years old.  She picked up on her job responsibilities fast.  Only worked for us two days a week, part time.  She had a work from home job too, but I don\u2019t know what it was.  Coworkers said she was surface-friendly, but standoffish.  Ate lunch alone - common for us, we\u2019re a Very Busy Very Public workplace so we like alone time on breaks.\n\nSeems like she just did the thing a lot of schizophrenics do, and went off her meds around the time we hired her because she \u201cdidn\u2019t need them anymore.\u201d",

Usually the employees complain about the customer enough times and the customer does enough things that could end up costing the store money that they agree to a ban and then the employees are the ones who have to tell them the next time they're in there that they can't sell them any more phones. The town and store are small enough they just all know who is banned.\n\nThe two examples I remember off the top of my head was the lady who came in about 3 times a week for two months to buy new phones because they were getting \"possessed\" (like by demons and ghosts and shit) and then she would accuse the employees and Walmart of selling her already possessed phones and try to call the cops if she couldn't return them (they were usually pretty damaged when she tried to retun them) Obviously she was mentally unwell but it costs the store money to have someone at the electronics counter harassing the employees and keeping them from working three times a week.\n\nThe other was a man who would come in and buy cheap phones and have them set them up on a plan and then just sit at the counter and watch porn on his old phone while they set up the plan. (All the electronics employees were women at that time) and then he would try and get them to watch the porn with him usually while they were on the phone with Straight talk trying to set up the phone. Eventually management decided he was purposely harassing the women in the department and banned him from getting phones. I think he might have been banned from the store later as well, for harassing some of the cashiers up front, but I won't swear to that.",

Things may have changed, your mileage may vary etc etc. \n\nA real formal ban involved the police (who were usually already there or nearby) would detain you, get your name and ID (if you had one) give you a written ticket saying you were being trespassed from the property and if you were on property again you were subject to arrest usually a photo was taken at some point and put in the breakroom for people to keep an eye out for. If they spotted you again call the cops and they arrest you. Apparently corporate would also tell you in scary legalize that you were banned from all the other stores as well but I am not sure what if anything they did to enforce that.",
