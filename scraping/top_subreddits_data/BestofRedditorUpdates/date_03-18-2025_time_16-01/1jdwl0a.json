My (24F) boyfriend (26M) of 3 years had told me over the weekend that he made reservations for a romantic restaurant on the lake. I was excited because our jobs don't allow us a lot of time to spend together as is. I packed a cute outfit and got everything ready this morning to change into after work.\n\nThen, he texts me. \"I actually can't take you tonight, I'm going with my mom and sister (25F) instead.\". Now, normally, I'm pretty understanding, but this is weird, right? He kind of just brushed me off with a \"Well, they really wanted to go. So yeah, sorry.\". I have no problem with him spending time with his family...but this was supposed to be our date? Not to mention I had to prepare and pack everything since he lives about 45 minutes away from me. Now he's going to enjoy a romantic dinner with his mom and sister and I'm going back home to be by myself.\n\nAIO for being upset about this?\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**Magdovus**\n\n>Is this normal behaviour for him?\n\n**OOP**\n\n>>Honestly, yes. I usually take the high road with things like this. He loves them a lot and likes to spoil them but it's starting to effect me.\n\n**~**\n\n**Temporary_Refuse4638**\n\n>Is he actually going out with his mom and sister? Is this normal for your relationship? Has he always put his family first? Have you confirmed with his fam that he\u2019s going out with who he says he is? All around weird.\n\n**OOP**\n\n>>I know it sounds so weird but this is normal. He's really close with them. I know he's not lying about it (part of me wishes he was). I just think he's a family man. Like a super family man to the point where I'm left behind.\n  \n**UPDATE** : Thank you all for your advice. I have read all the comments, and I went ahead and pressed the issue a little further with him. \n\nTo respond to some questions in the comments : \n\n**Do you get along with his family?**\n\nHis family and I get along pretty well. We've been on trips together, gotten each other gifts for holidays/birthdays - the whole 9 yards. I have always had a creeping suspicion that they didn't like me because when I come over, they are super passive and don't really engage in conversation with me. When I ask my boyfriend, he says they're just reserved and shy. I think they just don't like that the only man in their life has a girlfriend. \n\n**Is he cheating on you?**\n\nI can confidently say he's not cheating on me. He just has this weird relationship / momma's boy thing going on that has always slightly bothered me. He literally goes out of his way to show his appreciation for them. Sometimes it's endearing, but sometimes, I feel like I'm on a back burner.\n\nNow. He said he understands where he went wrong and doesn't want me to feel like I'm the last option. Apparently he's been cancelling plans on them for a while so he felt bad when they expressed interest in going to dinner with him tonight - just them three. He said he actually made the plans with them yesterday but \"forgot\" to text me before I got all my stuff packed up. I'm still not satisfied with this response, so we'll have to talk in person after he enjoys his dinner with them. I will be putting my foot down about the mom and sister thing. Like seriously - his sister is older than me and he treats her like she is 9 years old. Thank you to all the women (and men) sharing their MIL / SIL / FIL stories. You've given me confidence to stand up for myself. \n\nAlso, thank you for the laughs. I tend to make light of situations. Your concern brought me some joy today. I felt CRAZY but you all made me realize I need to stand up for myself right now. \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/8BMNtK2Olq)  **March 11, 2025**\n\nI wasn't going to update but I am livid. \n\nTo clear it up from the beginning, **his mom and sister knew that we had a date**. They proposed the idea to get dinner with him. He told them he had already planned a date with me. They made sad faces and sighed \" Oh ... okay :( \". That's when he felt bad for them. The fact he even told me this is insane because why are two grown women guilt tripping you right now. \n\nI FaceTime called with my boyfriend last night (before dinner). We had a serious talk about his family and how I need him to start stepping up more. I told him I wont be option #3 for my entire life and threatened to leave if that was the case. He understood, agreed, and we moved on. He said his mom was just stressed about work and wanted to talk to him. Sure. Told him to enjoy his dinner and everything.\n\nFast forward a few hours later (during supposed dinner time). I'm on FaceTime with him again and wondering why he's not at the restaurant? His mom and sister fell asleep. They literally just...fell asleep. Here I am literally begging this man for one day a week to see him and his mom and sister (who live with him) fall asleep. I told him straight up that they disrespected his time and did all these theatrics for NOTHING. \n\nSo, yeah. That's the update. Thanks for all your tough love and good advice. I have a lot to think about today. Really, even the mean comments were good. I don't normally talk to people irl about my relationship so I appreciate the little bits of advice.\n\n**TOP COMMENTS**\n\n**GapRepresentative303**\n\n>You deserve a better man . Stop begging him for attention . You\u2019ll always be an afterthought for him . Find a guy who will prioritize you . \n\n>Have some self respect . \n\n**Corfiz74**\n\n>>If you do want to stay with him, I recommend you make yourself scarce - meet up with friends, prioritize everyone else over him, never call him first, don't have time for him when he wants to meet. Make him really work for a date - it will completely shift the power balance. Unless he really doesn't give a damn about you - but then at least you will know.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**",

There\u2019s never been a question of him not putting me first. She\u2019s a sweet lady, I really like her, but can be a little pushy, and he shuts it down when she goes too far. Before our wedding, I was sick/having tests done and he was out of town for work. She kept calling me asking me to add little things to our wedding. One night on the phone to him, I mentioned that she was stressing me out and adding too many tasks to my already full plate. I like her a lot, but she was making me nuts, I had a demanding job plus wedding stuff on top of the medical stuff,and it was just too much. He is a super laid back guy but I could tell this pissed him off and he goes, I\u2019m gonna call you right back. Ten minutes later he calls me back and was like, it\u2019s taken care of, she knows she\u2019s not to call you with any more requests and to call me, and I\u2019ll tell her no if it\u2019s something we don\u2019t want. She made a few more requests/ demands and he didn\u2019t even tell me about them, he just told her no because it was stuff he knew I didn\u2019t want but would probably feel too bad to say no. He\u2019s sweet to her but I hear him tell her no all the time. He\u2019s a good son, he just isn\u2019t a pushover. He was really sweet to my late mom too. If she needed something, he\u2019d drive over to her house and take care of it.  It\u2019s to the point where there are times when I mention doing something for his mom and he\u2019s like, omg no way, I\u2019m telling her you\u2019re not doing that, haha. We threw his dad a surprise party and the morning of, I was getting ready (drying my hair/ putting makeup on) and she called me asking me to go with her to pick up the cake. He heard me telling her yes and took the phone out of my hand and was like, \u201cshe\u2019s busy! Why are you asking her to go with you?\u201d I was like, it\u2019s a big cake, she probably wants someone to hold it so it doesn\u2019t tip over in the car. He\u2019s like, then I will go!\n\nI like that he\u2019s a good son but I was never gonna fight for a guy\u2019s attention over his mama.",
