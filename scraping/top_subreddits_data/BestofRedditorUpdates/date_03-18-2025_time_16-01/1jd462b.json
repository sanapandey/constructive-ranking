Latest update is 7 days old\n\n**Trigger Warning:**\u00a0>!suicide; self-harm!<\n\n**Mood Spoiler:**\u00a0>!frustrating for OOP!<\n\n**Original**\u00a0[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ibfkfk/aita_for_refusing_to_sing_at_my_brothers_wedding/)**: January 27, 2025**\n\nMy (28M) brother (33M) will be getting married in the fall. The two of us are fairly close, more so in the past few years, which is to say that he is not ignorant about past events in my life.\n\nRecently, I got invited to dinner by him and his fianc\u00e9e. The two were very obviously buttering me up to ask me something the whole time before my brother finally told me:\n\n\"So, \\[fianc\u00e9e\\] and I have been talking, and we'd really love it if you sang our first dance song, just the one song. I know you don't really sing anymore, but I dug up some old videos of you singing and she loves your voice just as much as I do. This could be your wedding present to us!\"\n\nFor background: I used to sing all the time. I formed a band with a bunch of my friends in high school, and we were very minorly successful. We had a YouTube channel with a few hundred subscribers, and there were a handful of people that had their own recordings that were posted to their own pages.\n\nIn this band was my best friend since second grade, Mason (not real name). Unfortunately, when we were 17, Mason took his own life. Additionally, I was the one who found him.\n\nThe band dissolved almost immediately, and our YouTube channel and all our own videos were taken down. Since then, I have NEVER sang. Singing without Mason felt wrong, so I didn't. Not in the shower, no karaoke sessions, not at church, never.\n\nMy brother knew all of this, but I wasn't sure if his fianc\u00e9e did, so I started off with \"Sorry, I'll have to refuse. You know I don't sing anymore\" in the interest of not totally ruining dinner.\n\nMy brother was annoyed as hell at this. \"Come on, it's for my wedding, it's just one song, I'm not asking for much here\" and so forth.\n\nI continued to politely refuse and left soon after. Shortly after, I start receiving countless calls from my mom, who also knows the reason why and decided to harass me about not singing. \"It's your brother's wedding! I think you really should see a therapist about this, we all love your singing voice and it's been 10 years since any of us got to hear it!\"\n\nThe two have since decided on a new tactic by saying that my song will be a good way to honor Mason's memory.\n\nThe point about therapy aside (I've been to lots of it. I'm at peace with my decision to stop singing) AITA for refusing? It's clearly important to them.\n\nEDIT: To clarify, I have really only ever performed with Mason. The joy I got from performing was not the act of singing itself, but from performing with my best friend.\n\n***OOP's Comment:***\n\nOk y'all, this is... overwhelming. Let me throw a few things in one.\n\n1. I don't know if my future SIL is aware of the full situation or not. I'd like to think she doesn't, but I'd rather not poke that hornet's nest until I have to.\n2. Yes, I HAVE been to therapy. Singing is something I did with Mason, well before we started a full band. It very much feels like a part of my life that belongs in the past. As I said in the edit, my joy is not from singing, it's from performing with him.\n3. \"Is that what Mason would have wanted?\" I don't know. He's not around to ask anymore.\n4. The \"extended family\" is not \"blowing up my phone.\" It's two people, and it's not blowing it up. My mom called repeatedly in one day, and has tried to throw it in a few times since. My brother is mostly giving me the cold shoulder. It's only been a few weeks since this conversation took place.\n5. To whomever said \"its been 10 years, you're not good enough to sing at a wedding,\" thank you. I genuinely laughed at this. It's a good point too. I'd probably sound like a donkey kicked me in the throat.\n6. No, I don't post a lot. This is a throwaway I barely use.\n\n*Number 5:*\n\nCommenter: No disrespect but if you haven\u2019t sung in 10 years ..your voice might not be good enough NTA\n\n>**OOP:**\u00a0Found it! Thank you, this one made me laugh. \ud83d\ude03\n\n***Top Comments:***\n\n**Winternin:** NTA. Your mom and brother should see a therapist.\n\nAs usual, wedding planning turns (some) people into monsters.\n\n**Bigstachedad:** It's your voice and your choice. Your brother, mother and, more than likely your brother's fiance, know why you no longer sing. Just because it's a wedding doesn't mean you must revisit your trauma. NTA.\n\n**Update**\u00a0[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ipm0b1/update_aita_for_refusing_to_sing_at_my_brothers/)**: February 14, 2025 (18 days later)**\n\nOk, idk if I have to do anything special to update people that commented Updateme on the last post, but here we are.\n\nThis is premature, but since the post I made was more popular than I expected (or wanted), I thought I'd give a small update.\n\nFuture SIL reached out to me because her washer broke and she wanted to come over and do a quick load of laundry. I wasn't thrilled about this, but I live close enough, I have in-unit, and the laundromats in our area are not the safest.\n\nI was content to just watch TV silently in my tiny apartment while we waited, but she of course had something to discuss. I thought for sure she'd be the third person to try to convince me, but no.\n\nInstead she told me that she wasn't sure if my brother was giving her the full story. She told me that \"he used to sing all the time, he was in a band, but he quit when the band broke up.\" (Which is technically true, but come on).\n\nI also learned that he had told many of his friends this too, about how he's always trying to convince me to come around and sing for all of them. He had literally never asked before THE conversation, but was prone to making comments like \"boy it sure sucks you don't sing anymore, I know a lot of people that would want to hear that.\"\n\nSo, I very briefly told her about Mason. Just the important bits. That I used to sing with him, then he died, so I don't have any desire to do so anymore.\n\nShe didn't say anything for awhile, but I saw her face go through about a dozen different emotions, and I'm pretty sure she settled on anger.\n\nBefore she left, she just told me that she's going to tell my brother to get someone else to sing. I got the distinct feeling that it's not going to be a pleasant conversation.\n\nSo, that's it so far. All quiet. Fingers crossed.\n\n***Some of OOP's Comments:***\n\nCommenter (downvoted): SIL is awesome.\n\nAs an internet stranger I strongly recommend therapy.\n\nAnd... Do you think Mason would want you to quit singing entirely? I highly doubt that.\n\n>**OOP:**\u00a0I guess I could try breaking out the Ouija Board to ask him, but I've never had much luck.\n\n*You need therapy and therapy is nothing to be ashamed of:*\n\n>I agree: therapy is nothing to be ashamed of. Which is why I went out and got a lot of it, as I mentioned in the original post.  \nI do appreciate that you are likely coming to this with the best of intentions. But Mason is gone and no longer has an opinion on how I choose to live my life.\n\n**Top Comment:**\n\n**Individual-Total-794:** Go future SIL. At least you have somebody in your corner. And sorry for your loss.\n\n**OOP adds in**\u00a0[comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ipm0b1/comment/mcu72gi/:)**:**\n\nHi ya'll: again the response on this have been much here larger than anticipated. I just need to get something off my chest and hopefully I don't come across as overly aggressive.\n\nRegarding the obnoxious comments saying \"Is that Mason would want???\"\n\nI don't know, he's not around to ask anymore. The dead tend to not have opinions.\n\nI've had over a decade to process this. Via THERAPY (putting it in all caps this time). But I truly hope the people who comment this don't ever try this approach on someone who just experienced a loss. Regardless of intentions, it is grossly manipulative.\n\nAnd again, for the people in the back: I didn't stop singing because I thought that's what Mason would want or survivor's guilt or because I was actually secretly in love with him (yes, real DM I received). I stopped because I loved singing with my musical partner, who is now gone. I no longer find the act enjoyable.\n\n*Editor's note: There is a really sweet exchange between a commenter and OOP that ends up with an apple pie recipe*\u00a0[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ipm0b1/comment/mcufwx9/)\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j89kxs/update_2_aita_for_refusing_to_sing_at_my_brothers/) **2: March 10, 2025 (almost 1 month later)\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\nI was told people prefer linking the original post in updates. Hope that works.\n\nI cannot believe that this is still a thing, much less one that people are interested in? Lucky me though, because the overwhelming support I received here convinced me to do some things I definitely wouldn't have done otherwise.\n\nNew things happened pretty quickly, but I held off on a new post because my last one was premature. Some things people predicted happened, other things did not.\n\nLet's get this out of the way up front: The wedding is still on. The wedding will always still be on. This was never in doubt. I think a lot of commenters vastly overestimated my importance.\n\nAfter talking with future sister-in-law, I did not hear anything from my brother, at least initially. I did eventually get a short text from her just saying that I shouldn't worry about the wedding anymore and they'll find someone else.\n\nMy mom was another story.\n\nShe called me repeatedly since I ignored her first few calls, and when I finally picked up, she was about two steps below screaming into the phone. About how I \"interfered in your brother's relationship and made things so much harder for them!\" and \"do you know how upset he is right now? It's time to put grudges aside and make amends!\"\n\nIt was not an especially long conversation.\n\n\\[I feel it is important to provide some context for my mom. I've seen some comments about she has clear favoritism for my brother. Strictly speaking, I'm not sure that's true. Over the years, she said or did some things to my brother that has, at several points, caused him to go no contact with her. Some of these I fully understood, others... created some questions. As a result, my mom tends to overcompensate when it comes to him because I think she's terrified of getting cut off again.\\]\n\nI did a lot of self-reflection over the next few days about my relationships with my family members, and decided it was time to have a very honest conversation with my brother. I even booked a bonus therapy session specifically about preparing myself for this conversation.\n\nI called him up and asked him point-blank if, knowing I will absolutely NOT be singing for him, he still wanted me to attend. He didn't answer for a bit, but eventually he said yes.\n\nI remembered a bunch of comments that said he may still try to pull something at his reception anyway using public pressure and announce me as the singer. While I personally didn't find that to be especially likely (my brother is a big planner/scheduler), I realized I no longer trusted him like I used to and said as much, and that I will only be attending the ceremony, not the reception.\n\nHe had a minor freak-out over this (\"are you fucking kidding me?\"), but then said it was whatever, and that I needed to come up with a concrete excuse for my absence so that \"bullshit doesn't overshadow everything\" (fine, whatever) and that I could no longer be his groomsman since that would leave an empty chair at the head table.\n\nWe hung up shortly after. We have not spoken again since.\n\nSomething that hasn't come up before: we both have two other brothers (35, 26). Neither live in the same area as us (my younger brother lives on the other side of the country), and we don't talk especially frequently, so I don't know what, if anything, they had heard about the situation previously.\n\nWell, because he kicked one of his brothers out of the wedding party, he decided to replace the other two as well because it wouldn't \"look right\" to have just 2 out of 3 of his brothers as groomsmen, so instead opted for 0 out of 3.\n\nEldest brother got kind of bratty about it (he included all three of his brothers in his wedding party when he got married and is mainly pissed about the non-reciprocation) but never asked for nor received the full story on our \"feud.\" I don't especially enjoy talking to him, so if he wants to blame me for getting booted from the wedding party, that's fine.\n\nMy younger brother, on the other hand, made it his personal mission to extract every single detail possible from all parties. He called me up to get my side, and then decided he was going to join me in skipping the reception. He has decided to start brainstorming an excuse for the both of us. Honestly, I think he was looking for an excuse not to go anyway, he despises family functions.\n\nAt this point I am praying for no more updates. This is just fucking absurd. The wedding cannot come soon enough.\n\nThis is not related to the update, but instead to the comments/DMs I received.\n\nI have tried my best to be civil with the many, many comments of \"Is that what Mason would want?\" or \"Have you tried therapy?\" We are now three posts deep on this nonsense. I'm not going to be trying so hard at civility anymore.\n\nAlso a reminder: singing was a HOBBY. I gave up a HOBBY.\n\nI was not on the cusp of making it big. I did not throw away my dreams. This is 5 dudes screwing around in a basement on weekends and occasionally playing at a bar, fair, or coffee shop. For what it's worth, I still listen to music and even will pick up my bass again on occasion when I'm bored.\n\nTherapy is not an undo button on grief and trauma. I am not the same person I was before he died, and I never will be again. Therapy is about accepting this and the new person I've become, not going back to the way things were. New OP! Model does not include singing!\n\n***OOP's Comment:***\n\nCommenter: It's good that you have at least one level headed brother on your side.\u00a0\n\nOne day at a time, one step at a time is all we can do.\n\nToo bad it would affect the fiance, but if someone comes near you with a mic at anytime, you should start the deepest, heaviest death metal growl and launch into the raunchiest song you can find.\n\nJust joking, folks!!\n\n>**OOP:** Honey came in and she caught me red-handed  \nCreepin' with the girl next door  \nPicture this, we were both butt naked  \nBangin' on the bathroom floor",

Weirdly, other people try to take ownership of their talent. We see this with performers who retire, with their fans going \"Aw why? They're good enough to keep going for a bit\", as if the performers' wishes don't enter their thoughts at all. We also see this with overzealous parents who try to show off their kids' talents, and any resistance is taken as an offence like \"how dare you not perform for us?\"",

It is possible that singing even helped drive our evolution, when our ancestors developed large enough brains and the right vocal equipment layout to be able to sing. Singing is quite literally one of things that makes us human. Its importance to human culture, development, brain patterns, etc. can\u2019t really be overstated.",

Current research is that the brains of people like me are literally wired differently.  I've always been like this and I think of it a lot like being colorblind.  Sure, people have different relationships with Music than I do but it isn't like I'm broken, I just don't react to music the way I do to great novels, kittens, rainbows, etc.\n\nWhen I've mentioned this to people I've gotten *really* weird reactions.  People have asked me if I have a soul.  A couple people have literally told me they would kill themselves if they were like me.  Its hard not to be a little offended. Really?  Not deeply feeling Beyonce would be worse than death?  \n\nAnyway....

One of them was that older siblings/cousins should marry first.\u00a0\n\nI got engaged first to an older gentleman right out of college because he had amazing health insurance and I wanted that sweet sweet tax break for married couples. He was also, as the kids say, hella cute.\u00a0\n\nAt the reception, the mother of the oldest few cousins comes up to me and tells me I was wrong to have skipped the line!! She called me an arrogant whelp for marrying early then walked off. I didn\u2019t even realize what had happened until the night was over and was trying to organize wedding gifts and realized her family had all refused to send one as a show of some sort of fucked up solidarity. Mind you, she popped out so many kids that their group was a tenth of the guest list.\u00a0\n\nThen there was my estranged sister, who came in a white dress, dragging a random date she found just two weeks before. No one bothered spilling wine on her, though my photographer did take the time to edit her out of all of my photos.\u00a0\n\nAnd another cousin tried to propose to his long time girlfriend on the dance floor, she ripped him a new one then tore a strip off my butt for egging him on lol\n\nIt\u2019s been twelve years, things aren\u2019t perfect but we\u2019re still married and having fun every day",

I actually read in another comment how people did stop eating certain things because those things were most associated with a deceased loved one. And that's absolutely ok to stop eating something or doing something.\n\nIt does not, as you say, affect their day to day life. It's not necessary in their life. Mute people exist, people with allergies exist. Refusing to eat a specific food or not being able to sing doesn't make them unable to live their day to day life. Acting like it does is as ridiculous as saying that the guy who works at my local gas station needs help because he refuses to sing due to having a hole in his throat. \n\nJust because it's about grief doesn't make it much different. No decent therapist is going to encourage OOP or anyone like them to do anything related to a hobby that's just not pleasant for them anymore especially when it's not something important because singing or eating a favorite food isn't necessary in your life. In fact a good therapist understands that everyone handles grief differently and has different needs in order to cope with loss and giving something up because it's not the same without the lost person is a normal thing people do.",

People all over Reddit assume that therapy is a catch all \"cure\" for whatever is going on in your life. Had a less than ideal childhood because your family was poor and now you tend to be more frugal than other? Therapy. A family member passed away and you slowly process  things on your own pace but are still happy overall? Don't lie to yourself you need therapy. A mild inconvenience happened and you are a mildly frustrated because of it? Oh honey you absolutely need therapy.\n\nIt is super annoying. A: not everything needs therapy. B: there is such a huge range of ways therapy can look like. Just saying get therapy is not particularly useful. C: even then therapy simply does not work for everyone.\n\nAnd in this case OOP even did have therapy. He says he is over it (to the point where he cracks jokes about whooping out the Ouija Board) and he is fine. But He finds no joy in singing anymore because it is something he wants to do with his friend and not without him. \n\nBut no. Our dear redditors know better and tell him to get even more therapy because if it worked he should be able to enjoy singing again which displays a terrible misunderstanding of what therapy should do. It's not supposed to revert you back to you \"old and normal\" self anyway. It's (usually) supposed to help process your grieve and ideally help you get out of self destructive behaviours as a result of your grieve and maybe help you accept the new situation as is and try to move on from there instead of being stuck in the past in an unhealthy manner. \n\nRedditors man I swear.....\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk.",

The choir was taught by only 1 woman, she taught every choir for each age group and she became like a second mom to most of the kids she taught including me.\n\nShe instilled such a love of music in every child she taught it was an incredible thing, our choirs almost always got top\u00a0scores at competition (other choir kids will understand this). All this to say she was an incredible person and teacher.\n\nThe first semester of my senior year she was murdered in a botched robbery. About 150 kids were absolutely devastated, all of us mourning her.\u00a0\n\nThe first time I went back to choir (a parent who was in the community and also a trained choir director was subbing for the remainder of the year) and tried to sing I started crying because of /holding the sheet music/. I remembered when I was 8 and just starting and she showed me how to hold it so I could see both pages and turn the page easily.\u00a0\n\nThat is to say, the smallest and weirdest things can trigger you when you lose someone so suddenly like that. I personally never stopped singing because I actually do know that's what she would have wanted, I made it through that last year with the substitute. But in that time I did consider quitting, it hurt to see someone else up there directing us in a slightly different way than she would have.\u00a0\n\nI completely understand why OOP quit. I almost did but managed to keep going because I believed that music was a gift my teacher gave me. But for OOP it wasn't like that, it was something he SHARED with his best friend. Without the ability to share it with his friend there was no point anymore and trying to do it alone would likely trigger OOP and set him back in his healing process.\u00a0\n\nIt is hard for people to understand why something joyful like singing would trigger you but the thing is, singing for those of us that have practiced and performed has a LOT of emotion in it. For OOP the emotions are no longer joyful, it only carries sadness. It is completely reasonable and fair for OOP to not want to sing anymore and all the commentors and his family trying to push him is ridiculous. All these armchair psychs dont know OOP better than he (and his ACTUAL THERAPIST) does.\u00a0\n\nI hope OOP has found another hobby that brings him joy.\n\n(This was super long sorry for the trauma dump lmao)",

His friend'a death was entirely unanticipated. In order for singing not to be linked to his friend's traumatic death, the only thing he could have done here was never sing with the friend at all. I'd wager that he cherishes those memories and doesn't have any regrets about his singing trajectory.\n\nAnd, you know, it's okay to move on from hobbies and things you like. You can pick up new hobbies and things to like. These things don't define us, and it's okay when they change.",
