Me f26 and My husband m25 and I have been married for almost two years and have a 6month old baby.\n\nI work part time only to supplement our income and to pay for the legal process of getting him documented. We are very fortunate that it seems it may be an easy process of maybe 2 years max for his residency but now I\u2019m going to cancel everything and ask for a divorce.\n\nMy routine used to be I wake up 1.5hours before him in the morning and make him lunch and pack everything for him for work and have his breakfast coffee and clothes ready for him to wake up, eat get dressed and head out with in 30mins.\n\nHe used to be satisfied with what I packed him of freshly made chicken in either honey buffalo, lemon pepper and salad or some sort of chicken wraps ect. Pure healthy food. I did this because I wanted to make his life easier and show him I cared and love him and I\u2019ve done this since we first moved in together more then 3 years ago.\n\nWell recently I\u2019ve had to start including dinner leftovers because he started asking for more food that he was still hungry afterwords, which I thought it was odd because no matter if I work or not he always comes homes to prepared food so even if he wasn\u2019t full he would be okay. But I explained it off with maybe he\u2019s bulking or something.\n\nSo I started including what I normally take to work which has caused me to either go without lunch and having to wait til after work or be late for work because I have to wait till the food is ready and take some because I\u2019m breastfeeding and can\u2019t miss eating every time(I\u2019ll leave food going such as in a crockpot or low heat depending how long after I leave he gets home) Well last week when I was packing his lunch I found a unrecognized second fork in his lunchbox and was thrown off so I asked and he said he found it in the kitchen of his work and brought it home. (Odd why didn\u2019t he just leave it?) I had noticed small changes in him that I gaslighted myself into I\u2019m being insecure because I just had a baby but this made the pit of my stomach churn.\n\nSo a few days later I decided to go to his work during lunch to \u201csurprise him\u201d with dessert \ud83c\udf6e and for him to see the baby. Well that was when I found out why he wanted more food. His coworker he told me no longer worked there, who I\u2019d caught him talking too friendly to and I told him it bothered me and I had him remove from everything and block on whatsapp not only still worked there but was eating the lunch I freshly prepared for HIM and he was eating the leftovers.\n\nI didn\u2019t cause a scene instead took pictures and added to my folder of everything he\u2019s done before from simple hearting other girls stories after telling me he didn\u2019t to naked pictures of a coworker from a previous job he got fired from because of her.\n\nI drove home crying to packed my things when I got home I took the bassinet and anything I\u2019d need for the baby and my essentials and went to my sisters and BILs and told them everything and even showed him our conversations from WhatsApp where he told me she no longer worked there.\n\nI normally text him through the day so he started texting me and calling me to see if I was okay and what was for dinner? He was almost off is everything okay? And then he got to the house a hour earlier than usual (which also has me question if he\u2019s been lying about what time he gets off too) and saw mine and the babies things gone. And my letter that he had 7 days to leave my house (my mom gave it to me when I was 20) and that he can communicate with my mother to see the baby when I\u2019m at work or whenever he wants to see her just let her know and I\u2019ll drop off the baby with her. I for the time being don\u2019t want anything to do with him. And I left the printed fotos of them eating lunch laughing together under the letter.\n\nLater that night when I decided I no longer wanted anything to do with him I informed the lawyer (we had a group WhatsApp chat with me him, the lawyer, paralegal and my BIL (our cosponser)) that I no longer was going to need his services. And then messaged the lawyer privately to ask if I could maybe move our contract and the money I\u2019ve paid so far over to his divorce and family practice. He said unfortunately no there\u2019s some clause or something that if we decide to no longer pursue the case we lose the money we\u2019ve invested and also that his immigration practice is a partnership with different people then his family one. But he will just leave our case open till we get a response for our next appointment from the government and if we haven\u2019t worked things out by then, then he will cancel everything.\n\nWell this cause him to go insane because now if he doesn\u2019t get papers he has to choose between his daughter and parents. To either risk never seeing his parents and family again or never seeing his daughter again if he goes over there. He\u2019s begging me to the point I blocked him on everything, he\u2019s came to my BIL house and been told to leave or we are calling police then he later came back drunk with his buddies who then were all scared off by my BIL and his shotgun. I feel so lost, broken and depressed. I also have security at work to make sure he doesn\u2019t show up at my office. My sister tells me to leave him but not to divorce so he can never get with anyone else and get papers but I can\u2019t do that to him.\n\nIve gone back home (only to check on the house and see if he\u2019s gone im still staying with my sister) and surprisingly there\u2019s no damage to anything and his things (only) are gone. So at least I feel a little relief in that. I\u2019m not looking for advice I know I\u2019m not going back, there is no longer any trust, my mental health wouldn\u2019t be safe in that relationship, and I know I can\u2019t have my daughter grow up with that kind of relationship being an example.\n\nI just needed to put this out there in order for it to solidify in my brain and to be able to reflect that this is now a pattern and he\u2019s gone beyond disrespecting me by now also making me make HER food. I\u2019ve been budgeting trying to make things last, sometimes eating less then I want to or skipping meals if possible (if a meal was heavier of carbs I\u2019d skip since I should have enough for my milk supply) all to be able to pay bills, lawyer his gym membership and supplements. I lose out on rest and sleep because I ensure laundry and the house is kept spotless while the baby sleeps. I\u2019ve basically gone from an independent educated career woman to a 1950s house wife with a job and school, all because I blindly fell for this man. When I say I feel stupid that\u2019s an understatement.\n\n**Anyhow TLDR**: my husband had me (his breastfeeding wife) skipping meals and going out of my way to make him an extra lunch for his side chick at work. And now I have the house cars and he\u2019s lost his nuclear family and ability to get a green card to be able to stay in the states and/or see his family in Mexico ever again.\n\nEdit: My phone seems to post it without paragraphs no matter what I do but I promise i tried to format it even though I was an emotional mess. This time I double spaced the paragraphs to see if that helps idk if it\u2019s my phone or what.\n\nSome things I want to clarify I\u2019ve been seeing in the comments.\n\nNo my sister isn\u2019t pushing me to stay in a relationship with him, she\u2019s telling me not to divorce him so that he can\u2019t just go find another woman to marry and use for the green card.\n\nNo im not taking anything from him that wasn\u2019t mine before we got married. Before me he lived in a house with 7other men sharing a bedroom with a bunk bed, and he drove a 2000 Buick he had to unplug from the battery in order to use it again. That car got scrapped after the electrical when out. The car he is using is my car I got in high school that got me through high school part time /seasonal jobs and community college.\n\nAlso my mom isn\u2019t dead, she gave me my childhood home because I was going to college and it\u2019s 10minute commute from the college. She gave it to me because I\u2019m the last of the kids all my brothers and sisters are at least 10 years older and aside from my sister who\u2019s helping me, they all live in different states.\n\nHe left home with a motorcycle his customizing, his gaming systems, clothes and the guest bedroom tv which was the only tv that was not mounted.\n\nAlso I\u2019m not keeping his daughter from him. I just personally don\u2019t want to see him because I know he will try to give me a ton of excuses and try to make me \u201cunderstand\u201d him. He can speak to my sister or mom and they will supervise him to see his daughter whenever he wants to. There is no battle in that. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a bad father but I just don\u2019t think my relationship with him is the example I want to give my daughter.\n\nYes, I am Mexican too, my dad came to the states and then later brought my mom and 2 brothers 2 sisters. Took a decade to see each other again which is why I\u2019m so apart from my siblings and the only one born here.\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\n*Their relationship*\n\n>I\u2019ve been told by my sister to inform everyone that this was my first actual long term relationship. She says that may give people a clue as too why I was so naive.  \nIt was also very early in the relationship and we weren\u2019t living together yet. I met him when I was traveling around to local jobs where it was known immigrants worked to post and inform them of local resources to help them with medical insurance, free clinics and ESL programs for children and adults. I was working for a seasonal daycare program for agriculture workers.\n\n*How are you going without food if you both work and own your own home?*\n\n>He makes below minimum wage due to undocumentation, I work part time minimum wage because I can\u2019t be away from the baby due to breastfeeding. He also sends money to provide for his parents and younger siblings\n\n*Why did putting more food in his lunch cause budgeting issues?*\n\n>Yes, I was budgeting in order to be able to save money for the lawyer expenses but now that I look back it was basically him paying bills and pocketing the left over for gym and supplements plus tools/paints and whatever while my paycheck was going to groceries, his family in Mexico and diapers.  \nAnd yes, I feel really stupid, naive and blind\n\n*What would get you more child support- him getting a green card and permanent job here or not? Basically when should you divorce?*\n\n>This may be the numbness in me talking at the moment but I don\u2019t need his money he can contribute by buying her diapers clothes and whatever necessities. Now that I\u2019m not catering to him I can leave my part time paper pushing job and find a good daycare for my daughter go back to teaching.  \nI might also just sell my second car and lower my car payment. Full time job and one less person in my home also means lower utilities since it\u2019s less utilities being used at home. No mortgage, no stupid expenses on random gym crap/ $40 membership, just protein creatines and supplements was at least $150 a month not to mention whatever he was doing to that junk motorcycle.  \nMy sister and mom have talked me through finances and my BIL said I could honestly keep my part time job get on government benefits and spend more time with my daughter but I think mentally I need to go back to teaching, and feel the independence of being self reliant again. Food stamps feels like it\u2019s just one thing he will throw in my face. Idk if I\u2019m trying to hold on to what little bit of pride I have left or it\u2019s just the anger I have inside that I wanna show him and his chick I am better without him.\n\n*To another commenter:*\n\n>If I continue with the process I\u2019ll be legally and financially responsible for him for years to come. Supervised visits is due to him never being more the. 3 hours (aka one bottle fed) alone with the baby. Also the fear of him taking my child to another country now that he\u2019s loss everything here and he may just decide to go to Mexico a place where he can\u2019t come back unless he risks his life again, is very real.\"\n\n*The other woman:*\n\n>Idk she doesn\u2019t have anything to offer she doesn\u2019t have a legal status either because she overstayed her visa to my understanding from a coworker of his I went to school with. According to her that woman is younger, no legal status or education, no English and she\u2019s already gotten in trouble for being inappropriate in the work place before and if there is proof that they are being inappropriate that will be a strike against him and firing against her. Apparently she likes to call herself \u201cone of the guys\u201d because she\u2019s a woman who works in a male dominated job and degrades women making jokes with the men.\n\n**Update**\u00a0[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/17r90k1/update_husband_feeding_side_girl_wives_cooking/)**: November 9, 2023 (almost 3 weeks later)**\n\nSorry it\u2019s been a while since I updated anyone, I\u2019ve been busy sorting out my life and this was supposed to be a throwaway so I didn\u2019t expect it to blow the way it did much less anyone to actually want updates.\n\n\\-I guess I\u2019ll start with the most asked question which was if I left him?\n\nYes, I also got a full check up and I indeed had an infection I was lucky I could treat and be good without any further issues.\n\nThis also confirmed his unfaithfulness because as I mentioned I had a baby not long ago and during the whole pregnancy they checked me for everything and they had done a full panel when I was 3months postpartum because I got a UTI and my doctor wanted to ensure it was only that.\n\n\\-Did I talk to him to get his side of the story?\n\nYes, when I went to tell him about the infection I allowed him to speak his mind about everything I only asked him for the truth as there wasn\u2019t anything else for him to ruin, it was completely over at this point.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a basic tldr:\n\n\u2022 He never meant to hurt me, he loves his daughter and me \u2022he enjoyed the attention it was something new and exciting \u2022it took his mind off the stress of bills, kid, my \u201cemotional\u201d state and the general routine his life \u2022life had gotten boring and she entertained him (I\u2019m sorry that your wife organized your previously chaotic life)\n\nThat\u2019s about what I believed to be true out of the couple of hours of begging, excuses, gaslighting, and even blaming.\n\nThe rest was:\n\n\u2022The infection is a common one that happens because of cow \ud83d\udca9 everywhere and because he goes out and pees outside without washing his hands or something \ud83d\ude44\n\n\u2022She doesn\u2019t like men she was just one of the guys (cmon really??)\n\n\u2022I only gave her lunch that day! It was just the one time that she forgot her lunch and she asked me because she saw I had two lunches \ud83d\ude44\n\n\u2022He would never stand so low to break his family why would I make such assumptions (oh so you knew what you were doing)\n\nOnce I showed him my MyChart with my results and explained how it\u2019s not a normal infection like ecoli that you can get because of poop and it was an actual transmissible infection.\n\nI also explained that I hadn\u2019t slept with anyone since we met! And how my doctor explained that if I would have had any kind of transmissible diseases I would have known during my pregnancy because not only is it common practice to test for all risks but my high risk pregnancy and preterm labor she tested for all kinds of things to see if she could find the cause of issues and afterword to find the cause of preterm labor.\n\nHe admitted it shortly after that he listened to me and saw my drs note (I\u2019ll add I have the best obgyn and she was amazing in listening to me and allowing me to cry and gave me not only support during that moment with even having a nurse take my daughter out for me to cry but also printed me information and ensured me that a simple medicine will make it all go away and I should not see any more issues)\n\nAnyhow\n\nHe\u2019s staying at the dairy at some trailer the owner let him borrow and for those who thought she would take him in turns out she\u2019s engaged and she is about to start her wedding and do a adjustment of status (get her papers)\n\nAnyways I\u2019m back to living on my own, my baby is doing great, I have another office job lined up for January, and I have a few universities I\u2019ve applied to, I\u2019m currently going to community college online but if I get into a uni I think I\u2019ll move out of this town, my grandma said she would move with me to help me.\n\nSome days are long like today it\u2019s late at night and I can\u2019t sleep because I miss him. But I\u2019ve been entertaining myself getting rid of stuff in my home to start a new slate and organize everything.\n\nI won\u2019t lie and say I\u2019m doing great. On my days off I don\u2019t get out of bed. My house is clean but my bedroom has my laundry basket over full and I brought out the guest blankets and pillows to use.\n\nPeople at work have noticed a slowed pace in my work and I was offered time off but I denied it. Although now that somehow the rumor of what happened has reach my job I may take it.\n\nThank you for all the support everyone. Although I had a few people call me names and talk badly to me in my messages, I appreciate the other people who commented nice things and showed me support.\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\nEdit for update:\n\nWoke up to husbands call, he apologized again. I\u2019m Still not budging, but he told me he was talking to some guys at work about free clinics or where they go when their sick and turns out that same woman has been sleeping with a few from there. Idk if around the same time but one of them told my husband where to get treated for free because he got it from her too.\n\nIn his apology which sounded more sincere this time but I believe it\u2019s worse because it\u2019s only after he realized he wasn\u2019t special to her just another one of the guys she slept with.\n\nBut I say sincere because he didn\u2019t have many excuses instead he seemed to hold himself accountable by saying he had won the lottery and messed up. He begged for a second chance because he doesn\u2019t know what came over him. He says he hates coming home to an empty trailer he misses seeing his daughter the moment after work.\n\nWhat choked me up was when he said he used to feel more exhausted when he used to come home to us because the baby would be excited to see him and would cry to be held by him, and during the week I would often leave the same easy meals made for him so he could eat while I left to work and he started to feel tired of it. It was a boring routine of same foods during the week. Coming home and having to watch the baby so I could go to work.\n\nThat solidified to me that I don\u2019t ever want to find another relationship much less go back to him. The routine I worked hard to put my family together, was a chore to him. I literally dealt with a fussy tired child til he got home so she would mostly sleep and he would only need a single bottle for her but even that was too hard.\n\nHe said he would give up the world just to be back into his routine because now he comes home to an empty trailer where it\u2019s just a bed and a fold out table. He hasn\u2019t eaten his diet because he doesn\u2019t have time to prep. He started spending money on lunch because he doesn\u2019t have food made for him. He says he misses the baby so much that he now cries when he goes home.\n\nI told him idk what to tell him about that, but if wanted to see the baby when I go to work he can go see her at my moms who now\u2019s babysits for me. Knowing my mom she makes food and she would never deny him food so he can go over there and eat and be with the baby after work. But I had to go I couldn\u2019t talked anymore.\n\nWhen I tell yall I\u2019ve never cried so hard in my life, it\u2019s an understatement. It doesn\u2019t help it\u2019s raining today. I think I\u2019m calling into work today and tomorrow talking to my boss about taking those days.\n\n\u2026\u2026..\n\n**Edit: November 10 (Same Post)**\n\nI was logging off for a while but I figured I\u2019d update everyone to let you know she found my home and started harassing me now. I guess somehow her fianc\u00e9e found out and she thinks it was because of me. I feel like things are just going from bad to worse. I had to leave my car in my moms garage and borrow my nephews car which my neighbor let me park in her driveway because she threatened to ruin my car like \u201cI ruined her relationship\u201d, which isn\u2019t just hypothetical but also ironic.\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\n*What have you decided regarding legal aspects of this (ie green card)?*\n\n>I don\u2019t want to make any legal decisions at the moment. I\u2019m barely getting through leaving him, I don\u2019t want to also put on too being responsible for my daughter to lose her dad. Because of his stupidity\"\n\n*Someone cautions her to not overly listen to reddit here, because this is a decision with huge ramifications. She should just do what feels right for her and her child:*\n\n>I feel like there\u2019s no way out without severe damage. I feel like I\u2019m in that bridge game from squid games except all tiles break at any decision just some have lesser consequences than the others.  \nI currently don\u2019t want to make ANY decisions because I feel safe in limbo atm because even though my logical reasoning understands if he gets deported it\u2019s going to be from his decision my emotional reasoning feels responsible for it. I don\u2019t want him back the betrayal and his dishonesty has broken any trust I could ever have and I don\u2019t think it would be good for my mental health to continue a relationship like that.  \nI grew up seeing my mom always asking and wondering if my step was cheating or not to the point my mom neglected us because she was so busy ensuring her husband wasn\u2019t cheating. It turned a once loving caring involved mother into a toxic person who would take her daughters out at 3 am to go to shady neighborhoods to see if her husbands car was outside someone\u2019s house.  \nI don\u2019t want that for myself or daughter. I saw cheating ruin my mother without her ever being unfaithful, I seen it destroy my sisters first engagement , I have seen my brothers bleed from aggressive cheating women who attack them for wanting to take their kids from toxic environments with drugs and other men.  \nCheating is something I don\u2019t want ANY involvement in and I\u2019ve seen what it does to people. But I also have that responsibility that I want my daughter to have her dad. So in the meantime I am having that distance because I KNOW what is better for her and I am trying my best to stick to the logical conclusion not the emotional one.  \nNo matter how much I miss him, but I tell myself I don\u2019t miss this person talking to me. I miss the person who made me feel safe, loved and cared for. And even then I\u2019m starting to look back and realize a lot of it was me in a delusional state thinking that him hugging me when I asked, me going to him for kisses, me cuddling to him, was all love. I felt safe with him not because he made me feel safe but because I thought i was. But looking back it\u2019s embarrassing to say I was the one who did a lot of the instigating of affection.  \nMaybe some of the people who messaged me saying I was I was psycho were on to something. I\u2019m starting to feel like maybe I was in some delusional state and he was just using me.\"\n\n**Legal Advice**\u00a0[Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/17rz46f/what_do_i_need_to_file_a_restraining_order_in/)**: November 10, 2023 (Same day as the edit in update post)**\n\n**Title:** What do I need to file a restraining order in Texas?\n\nMy husband cheated on me and the woman who he cheated with is now harassing me. Ig she was engaged and was about to go from a visa to residency because of her fianc\u00e9e but somehow he found out about her relationship with my husband.\n\nShe believes it was me but I don\u2019t know who her partner is/was or who told him yet since like 4pm today she\u2019s done the following:\n\n\u2022punctured a hole in one of my tires\n\n\u2022wrote on my front bay window \u201chome wrecker\u201d\n\n\u2022 keeps calling me from different numbers and now I\u2019m starting to receive spam text messages after I blocked all of her numbers and stopped answering random numbers\n\n\u2022threaten \u201cI\u2019ll ruin your car like you ruined my relationship ####\u201d\n\nThis is all since this afternoon. I called the police but by the time they showed up she was gone. And they said I had no prove of what\u2019s she doing so unless they find her doing it or I have prove their hands are tied.\n\nMy mom and step dad said they will put up cameras in my home and my mom is keeping my car at her home. They want me to stay with them too but I don\u2019t want to leave my home incase she tries something against it.\n\nThe most I was able to get is a police officer patrolling the area. Meaning they will be close by and randomly pass by.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do, I don\u2019t even know who her partner is and I\u2019m already dealing with leaving my husband and now she\u2019s harassing me?\n\nAny advice before it gets worse?\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*New to this sub Comments\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\nCommenter: Your situation is very similar to mine which started 15 years ago. I made the decision to stay to make sure he got his green card and stayed with his son in turn, I received so much abuse from him. He is a narcissist and he subjected me to all kinds of abuse. I stayed because of my son and finally decided to leave. I was waking him for 15 years and once I left he stopped contact with our child, so all the abuse I endured it was pointless.\n\n>**OOP:** He was never abusive in any physical way but looking back I believe him to be very manipulative and immature. I don\u2019t want to waste anymore time if it was possible I would go back and refuse to ever give him the time of day. It\u2019s been the worst month of my life and going back or if I\u2019d stay I can\u2019t see it would have ever gotten better.  \nI\u2019ve loss so much hair from stress my milk supply has plummeted to the point I think I may need to supplement formula soon, my mom tells me to just switch to formula because all my stress is going to go to the baby. But we\u2019ve had such a bad formula shortage I don\u2019t want to.  \nI don\u2019t think my situation would have been any better if I would have stayed because I don\u2019t think he would have changed his behavior just hid it better. My trust issues (which I had already prior to this whole mess) would have driven me into the same stress so I\u2019m just give god thanks for him opening my eyes and not putting me in a worse situation.  \nI\u2019m sorry your ex was just as horrible and you feel all your suffering was pointless. I believe it tells how important your son was for you and how selfless you are.\n\n**Update** [Comment](https://www.reddit.com/user/Empty_Researcher_348/comments/17seakt/comment/k9qqkgh/?context=3)**: November 18, 2023 (8 days later, almost 1 month from OG post)**\n\nThank you. My baby and I are. Doing better. She\u2019s doing okay atm but unfortunately I\u2019ve started to show some physical symptoms of the extreme stress I\u2019ve been going through. As of Wednesday I haven\u2019t had anymore issues with the woman as my step dad put cameras up and the moment one of the cameras alerted me they captured movement I got on the phone with police.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what she was planning but she spent enough time under my kitchen window and my laundry window that the police showed up and got her for trespassing now with my video evidence I\u2019ve sent it to the guy who was originally our immigration lawyer who said he will be doing a immigration report on her and use my original picture of her \u201cworking\u201d and my video evidence of her trespassing and idk what else to prove she\u2019s not only in the country while her visa isn\u2019t active but also working and doing illegal things.\n\nIdk what she wanted but if she would have left me alone I would not have done anything. I didn\u2019t report to her fianc\u00e9e or do anything against her. Everything naturally happened and now in order to protect myself I\u2019ve had the lawyer report her for me.\n\n**Update** [Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/17r90k1/comment/kd59zjg/?context=3)**: December 12, 2023 (about 1 month later, shy of 2 from OG post)**\n\nTLDR: I\u2019m okay, ex is still a ex, ex is still sleeping with others, harassment is less severe but now more people. Ex is either stupider than I thought or manipulating women to harass me. And the girl, my ex and all other illegal workers were fired but to my knowledge not deported.\n\nNow more detail is below \u2b07\ufe0f\n\nWe\u2019re okay, I\u2019ve been numb to the whispers and just waiting for the office closing days for holiday vacation to start so I can go to Mexico for a while til our office reopens mid January. I\u2019ve made friends with my areas police officer so he comes by and sweeps the area often and even has had his wife come stay with me and help me with my daughter and help me stay safe.\n\nI quit posting because the post actually blew up enough to where she found out about it I guess I wasn\u2019t vague enough. I guess her husband uses Reddit and after he found out about her cheating and drama he put two and two together and reached out to me and I was able to confirm it was him by phone and met in person to talk. *\\[editor's note- this post did get a lot of traction on several different subs and was posted several places outside of reddit, including facebook, youtube, pinterest and tiktok. To me it's actually quite plausible someone found it\\]*\n\nTurned out he actually reported her overstay but I guess somehow she didn\u2019t get deported but she along with a few others including my ex were all fired from their job because of his report. According to him she won\u2019t be able to ever renew her visa again because she came as a tourist which means she can\u2019t work. He apologized for her craziness and offered to help me but I turned him down because his involvement might actually make it worse.\n\nMy ex started sleeping around and I guess doesn\u2019t learn his lesson. I don\u2019t care anymore though I\u2019ve come to peace he\u2019s not the person I married. I\u2019m so disgusted by him now that I don\u2019t even like him kissing on my daughter. He does come to see her when my mom watches her more now that he got fired and is job haunting. I ask my mom that he leaves before I pick up because he will start crying the moment he sees me and tries to hug me.\n\nPolice have been useless aside the friendly officer and his wife. It\u2019s not just that girl now, it\u2019s like 3 girls who are her friends plus a few others who have slept with my ex who harass me because he tells them he loves me and wants me back which I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s stupid or is manipulating them to attack me for him.\n\nEither way I\u2019ve deactivated all of my social medias and the ones I do use are all private or with a different name so I can just use but I just don\u2019t post.\n\nSorry it\u2019s long and boring.\n\n***OOP adds:***\n\nAlso one of the people who was sending me hate messages saying I\u2019m a psychopath I deserved the cheating and talking a lot of crap to me was her, her ex confirmed her account.\n\n**Mini Comment** [Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/17r90k1/comment/kp06uny/?context=3)**: February 4, 2024 (1.5 months later, 3.5 from OG post)**\n\nShes finally stopped but I think it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t know anything of where I live work or do. \u201cSuspiciously \u201c when I quit informing my ex she also quit finding me. I only meet my ex in public now.\n\n**Final Update** [Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/17r90k1/comment/kp06uny/?context=3)**: February 6, 2024 (2 days later)**\n\nHonestly I\u2019m trying to focus on healing now. After everything I\u2019m disgusted to think back of a time I slaved for him. I look at him and it\u2019s just not the same.\n\nI used to see his green eyes and love his long lashes, now I notice his pimple scares and bad skin.\n\nI used to be excited for him to be home and try to think of something special to surprise him when he got home or what would get him to smile, now I just wonder how many time he was screwing around while I was fixing him something special or preparing everything for him to come home to a warm clean welcoming home.\n\nI never thought I would dread to have to see him or have anxiety when he\u2019s near.\n\nI just focusing on myself now.",

He was sitting at the bar watching a football game with a buddy and I was grabbing another drink for one of my friends when I see this (pretty attractive) woman come up to him and, I kid you not, say \u201cHi handsome.\u201d\n\nHe literally says \u201cNope\u201d and sets his drink down and then leaves (I guess he had paid his tab already?) but I\u2019ll never forget that woman\u2019s expression. She was genuinely gobsmacked. \n\nI mentioned it to them like a month later and my friend tells me that he told her about it too but that she was lowkey pissed that he didn\u2019t stay and get the score bc she wanted to know when he got home \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",

Unfortunately there may be repercussions either way and you may already have infected them if you had sex with them since cheating. \n\n And I saw a lot of partners confused how they got gonorrhea or chlamydia and you'd have to explain tgat we can re-test in case it's a false positive (rare but happens) but it's almost certainly because you had sex with an infected person since you were last tested negative. Most people can draw the inference for themselves.\n\nTreated them all kindly and respectfully, obviously. We arent there to judge or moralise. Most people aren't cheating...but a lot are.",

She worked 3 jobs and he got deported year 9 of the relationship. They do the long distance, she still sent him and his family money, she starts a side hustle on top of her 3 jobs so she can go to his country to surprise him for their 10th anniversary.\u00a0\n\n\nShe was the one surprised that when he said he was sending money to his family he meant his wife of 7 years, their 2 kids, and his 2 other baby mommas. All kids were younger then 10 if you know what I mean, and these women knew about each other and her. Obviously she cut him off and came home, but these women were the ones reaching out to berate her for not supporting him and the family and the kids anymore.
