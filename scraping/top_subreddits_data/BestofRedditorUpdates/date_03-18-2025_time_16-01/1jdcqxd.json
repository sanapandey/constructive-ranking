OOP is u/Dont-Call-Me-BALDY.\n\n**EDITOR'S NOTE: This is a repost of an [old BORU](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/14rd1op/aita_for_pressing_charges_on_a_former_friend_for/) that was posted by u/Direct-Catepillar77 almost 2 years ago.**\n\ntrigger warnings: >!Assault, mentions of a loss of a relative, and mentions of a possible mental illness!<\n\n-----------\n\nOriginal [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sf67dm/aita_for_pressing_charges_on_a_former_friend_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button): January 28, 2022\n\nFor context, a relative of what used to be a close friend of mine whom we'll call Gary for this story contracted cancer. I (Mid-20s male) was sympathetic and even contributed $100 to a donation pool for their treatment. But Gary came to me one day and took his hat off to reveal a freshly shaven head. He told me that everyone in his family were doing it in support of his relative, and so were a lot of our mutual friends. Then he asked that I get on the bandwagon.\n\nI told him I didn't want to shave my head because I like my hair. My hair is black, regularly combed and well styled. He said I could just get a wig or something and had actually brought his shaver kit. He was unboxing it when I told him this was not happening. I don't even really know his relative that he's doing this for. So I'm not doing it, end of discussion. He called me an &$$hole and left angry. We didn't speak for a week. Then last Saturday I got invited to a party at another close friend's house. There I found out that Gary had tried the same thing on several other friends, and only a couple of them actually did shave their heads.\n\nGary wasn't at the party, so I had a blast hanging out, playing video games and listening to rock music. But I had way too much to drink and couldn't drive home. So they said I could just sleep upstairs. I passed out on a bed and it was a blissful sleep till I was shaken awake by another friend who told me Gary had showed up late and they caught him shaving my head while I was passed out. I saw what I looked like in a mirror and wanted to scream like I was in a horror movie. Gary even shaved off one of my eyebrows.\n\nGary was still there and acting proud of himself saying \"Now you're gonna have to shave off the rest, just like me! LOL!\" I was furious and called the cops. When they got their Gary fully admitted to what he had done to me and even said he was justified. The police didn't seem to think so as this is classified as a form of assault. They asked me if I wanted to press charges and the first words out of my mouth were \"HELL YES!\" Gary cussed me out while they took him away in cuffs. I tried getting my hair restyled into something presentable. But there was no saving it and now I'm bald too.\n\nNow a bunch of Gary's family are telling me to drop the charges because Gary was off his meds and didn't mean to do it. I was like \"WTF?!\" because I never knew he was on meds. But I still refused to drop the charges. It'll take months to grow my hair back the way it was. But all of the calls and messages from Gary's relatives are starting to get to me. Just about everyone else in our friend group has cut Gary out though and say that I'm doing the right thing by not dropping the charges. So now I'm divided.\n\nAITA for pressing charges on a former friend for shaving my head in my sleep?\n\nEDIT: I want to make something clear here. So many people have said things like \"Dude it's just hair!\". But would they all be saying that if I wasn't a man? What if I was some girl that had hair that took years to grow? Would they be saying the same thing? Sure hair grows back. But it takes time. If it was something that grew back fast, people would be less inclined to care. But it's not fast. It takes months. And for some who had long hair, years. That's a lot of time wasted growing.\n\nAnd I don't plan on pushing for Gary to go to prison. But I don't plan to drop the charges either. His family already bailed him out. And while I didn't know he was on meds, I knew he had quite the temper, and even an entitled attitude at times. One example being a lunch where he wanted us all to combine the check and split it evenly. He got the most expensive thing on the menu. I got a cheeseburger. When we all said \"No\" Gary went off on us for not being good friends. He's always been an ass when he doesn't get his way. And I've only known him for like three years. This incident was the last straw for not just me, but a lot of other mutual friends.\n\nAs for the charges. I don't want to send Gary to prison. But I would like him to get some therapy and community service. With the way Gary has acted around me in the past, and what he did to me, I actually wonder how long before he got more violent. I've seen and heard of him getting in fights for less.\n\nEDIT 2: I've gotten many comments from people saying \"YTA! He has cancer!\". If you actually read what I posted, Gary is not the one with cancer. A relative of his I don't know does. And no, I don't know what kind of cancer. Gary didn't elaborate. He wanted me to shave my head for this person. And when I refused, he left in a tantrum. Then shaved my head while I was passed out drunk at a party.\n\n**Relevant Comments**\n\n**ghostess_hostess** ...but did you shave the other eyebrow to even out the regrowth?\n\n> **OOP** Unfortunately yes. I had to\n\n**No-Idea-Y-Im-here** NTA. Being off meds may be a reason, but it's never an excuse and that was definitely assault. In fact, if you haven't already told the police, make sure they know that Gary previously asked you to \"get on the bandwagon\", said he'd shave it for you while unpacking his equipment!, you refused and he verbally assaulted you. He knew you didn't and wouldn't consent, but did it anyway while you were unconscious. Block Gary and his relatives from everything, try not to get upset when you can't avoid a mirror, and hope your hair grows back better than before :)\n\n> **OOP** The police know every detail about Gary that I've given here, save for his family harassing me. Which I intend to tell the police about ASAP\n\n**scottieButtons** NTA, lucky for you the only difference between a bad haircut and a good one, is a couple weeks.. (maybe a couple months for you) sorry bud\n\n> **OOP** It'll be a couple of months sadly. It'll probably take five months to get my hair back to looking as good as it was\n\n> **OOP in regards to if his other friends knew about this** My friends all want nothing to do with Gary anymore. They didn't egg him on. They had no idea he was gonna do what he did\n\n**Lumpy_Passenger_1300** Actually if you're going to talk to the DA, they may be able to offer him a plea where he needs to stay on meds/go in treatment. NTA.\n\n> **OOP** I already figured not much was going to happen since I wasn't harmed other than my hair. Whatever deal he takes in court, if he gets one won't really matter to me. What does matter to me is that this due process makes him realize just how badly he screwed up. Meds or no meds.\n\n> **OOP in regards to if Gary brought his own shaving kit** He used some stuff that was in the bathroom next door to the room I was sleeping in. He didn't bring his own. But I can see why you'd think that. It's far from the first time I've passed out at a friend's house. And Gary knew that. In fact he was probably waiting for it. If anything, this has been a wakeup call to get my drinking under control.\n\n**TheHammerandSizzel** INFO - How did he get into the house? Your 100% NTA and should press charges. But who let him into that house? It was someones else place and I am assuming he either came in super late or early in the morning. The reason I am asking is that in addition to Gary, someone let him into the house and I would be interested to know the reasoning.\n\n> **OOP** Gary got in because they let him in. They figured his tangent about hair was over. He tried to convince a bunch of them to shave their heads like he did to me. And none of the people there let him do it. My guess is he singled me out because I was passed out. If not me, it could have been anyone else there if they'd passed out drunk instead.\n\n**Kitchen_Zebra_5403** See the difference between me and you is\u2026I\u2019d beat the hell out of Gary and I\u2019d be going to jail for assault\n\n> **OOP** Fighting isn't in my nature. I don't even usually get angry all that much. But if Gary had attacked me, I'd like to think my friends likely would have ganged up and beaten the crap out of him. But I really don't know.\n\n> **OOP on the evidence the police gathered** The police got a couple pictures of my head and the trimmer Gary used on me. But I didn't want any more photos of what I looked like show up. So I had the rest of my head shaved the next day.\n\n**deleted commentor** In your country, what are the consequences of having charges pressed against you?\n\nI've heard that in some corners of the world people can find it very hard to get jobs after getting jail time (which I acknowledge you don't want, but I supposed it's a possibility) which tends to cause a downward spiral that ends up disproportionately more punitive than the original conviction.\n\nIt sounds like you want Gary to change his ways. Would the result of pressing charges have that outcome?\n\nNTA BTW...\n\n> **OOP** Honestly it's a tossup from what I know. But I hope that if I push for just the minimum and only get him community service and therapy, then perhaps his record won't be affected too harshly. But I can't say for sure.\n\n> **OOP on how Gary got into the friend group** Gary isn't a relative of anyone I know. He was the neighbor of a friend of a friend who wormed his way into my friend circle. He seemed likeable at first. But once he seemed well established, he started letting his real self out bit by bit. A lot of us were already fed up with him.\n\n***Verdict: NOT The Asshole***\n\n-----------\n\nUpdate [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/145hlrk/an_update_to_gary_shaving_my_head_in_my_sleep/): June 9, 2023 (1 year later)\n\nA friend of mine just showed me a video yesterday in which my old post had been read. Honestly I'd nearly forgotten about it since I was only there to ask if I was TA or not. And since I don't wanna go through the pain of trying to do an update on AITA, I thought I'd just do it here since entitled spells out Gary pretty well. Other than the shaving incident, he tried to get us to partially pay for his food multiple times by combining the check and dividing it equally when he always got the most expensive thing on the menu, and once even pulled the \"I forgot my wallet\" bit. He was described as a neckbeard by multiple people, including women he flirted with. He tried to get a married neighbor woman that was older than him to have an affair with her. And then later egged her apartment door when she refused. That one I only learned about a couple months after my original post. And no, Gary never saw consequences for doing that. I also learned he stole several videogames and DVDs from friends, mooched food and drink out of their fridges, and even went through a period as a squatter for two months by refusing to leave a house he'd been let into by a former tennant, and the landlord actually paid him to leave. Gary's also an extreme hypocrite that contradicted himself more than a corrupt politician. For example, one minute he'd be anti-vax, the next he'd be complaining about other people who weren't getting the C19 vaccine. Pretty sure he never got it too. I can't believe I ever had any sympathy for this man.\n\nTo recap, someone a former friend of mine named Gary is related to got cancer. And Gary went around trying to get our friend group to all shave their heads. He only got a couple of them to agree, and even brought his shaving kit to my apartment because he just assumed I'd join in as well, and was already unboxing it before I even got the chance to say anything. I told him the shaving was not happening. Well he decided to make an example of me, and waited till I was good and passed out from drinking at a friend's party. I was so dead to the world that I had to be shaken awake by a friend after Gary got caught shaving my head. He took off one of my eyebrows and messed up my hair beyond saving. And he was laughing his butt off over having done it. So yes, the rest had to come off. I ended up pressing charges on Gary for assault, and found out he's been on meds for a mental disorder for years. And he'd stopped taking the meds, which is one of the reasons he was so loopy. But his tune changed pretty quick when police arrested him since what he'd done qualifies as assault.\n\nGary's family harassed me and tried to make me drop the charges. I not only didn't drop the charges, but I reported the harassment to the police. Only problem is it didn't bloody stop! In fact, it got worse! Mainly from Gary's mother, whom I can see where Gary got his charming personality from. She showed up to my apartment a couple of weeks after the shaving incident to scream at me that I knew nothing about what they were going through. And a little hair wasn't a big deal. I told her my hair was a big deal to me. And what Gary did was inexcusable. Well that earned me a slap on the face, followed by a swift kick to the nuts, followed by a few more kicks to my body after I went down. It was all recorded by a camera that I had watching the front door. (Landlord wouldn't let me put in a Ring Doorbell cam) One of my neighbors saw her, and screamed at her they'd be calling police. Gary's mom ran, and I ended up going to the hospital with minor injuries. Mostly just bruises, a black eye, and a sore groin.\n\nGary's mother got arrested, and I filed a lawsuit against her for attacking me. I saw her in court twice for both her assault on me, and the lawsuit I filed for her assault. This woman had taken several self defense classes over the years, so she knew how to fight. That had the judge consider her a trained individual, and she was sentenced to six months in jail, given two years probation, and ordered to pay my medical bills. She actually cried to the judge about the money. But he wasn't having it. It took some time to see her in court again for my lawsuit against her as she was out of jail by then. I was awarded ten thousand for the harassment, emotional damages, and lost work hours, and she had to pay all court and lawyer fees. Which she cried about again because she didn't want to pay anything to the man who'd ruined her and her son's lives. But she had the money for both court cases, because she had no problem paying. But around that time, I heard Gary's relative with cancer passed away. I don't know any details, just that they passed on. I admit that was sad. But I never knew this person. But Gary made their condition his hill to die on when he tried to make an example out of me. Gary got some probation and community service for what he did to my hair. And he cut contact with our entire friend group and eventually moved away. Where to, I don't know. I don't care either.\n\nAs for my hair. Well it grew back just fine. Took nearly half a year to get it back how it was. My boss had me put out of sight for a while, and I was wearing a hat everywhere for at least a month. I did take that 10k I got in the lawsuit and combined it with my savings for a down payment on a house. So I've since moved into a much better abode. I also have a girlfriend now that's living with me. It was a bit soon for her to move in, but there were extenuating circumstances. We're making it work though, and I'm happy.\n\n**More relevant comments**\n\n**MtnDream** here's the thing, as a man, you are reluctant to fight back against a woman, but she's no lady either. don't ever just let someone slap, and kick you because you refuse to fight back. Also, did the mother shave her head?\n\n> **OOP** No. She didn't shave her head. Unless she had a wig on, which I doubt. I don't know how many people in Gary's family did shave their heads because his mother was one of his only relatives I saw in person since the shaving incident. Otherwise all the harassment was online and over the phone. And yes, I was reluctant to strike back. But that old woman was faster than she looked. And that shooting pain from being kicked in the nuts is something I never wanna feel again.\n\n-----------\n\n**Reminder: I am NOT the OOP.**",

It reduces the risk of UTIs, and other issues if, for example, you live in an extremely sandy environment. \n\nReduced risk of UTIs is why my nephew needed one. He was born with several birth defects, one of them a shortened urinary tract that means that any UTI is significantly likely to travel to the kidney. \n\nA UTI isn't really that serious. A kidney infection really, really is. \n\nMentioning this on Reddit has previously resulted in rants in my inbox from circumcision obsessives railing about the infection risks of an open wound in an environment contaminated with fecal matter, so I'm going to pre-emptively note that his penis was only being exposed to urine, which is a substantially less acute biohazard. He had a colostomy.\n\nWhich is why he was also but going to be traumatised by any pain caused by the circumcision, since he was already undoubtedly in pain despite their best efforts due to having had major abdominal surgery immediately after birth.",

The claims about \"loss of sensitivity\" are moderately insane, because no-one who was circumcised at birth has any way to know, and many men circumcised later in life report *increased* sensitivity, not reduced.\n\nIt is still removing a small bit of largely extraneous skin. I don't like that it's done while still connected and even if it's very minor surgery it's still surgery, and all surgery has risks, and should not be performed without a reason.\n\nBut comparing it to removing a significant piece of not only skin but also bone, onychostroma and keratogenous membrane is way over the top.\n\nYou are getting dangerously close to the territory where anti-circumcision advocates tend to be so insane about it that they are actively harmful to the cause. The natural impulse of most people when confronted with hysterical lunatics making deranged comparisons is to assume that they're on a level with people who think vaccines come with 5G chips because something something Bill Gates.\n\nCircumcision should not be performed unnecessarily because no surgery should be performed unnecessarily. That's seriously as far as you need to go. The benefits for most infants are not significant enough to justify it; if, as an adult, a man wants the benefits of easier hygiene and reduced risks of UTI and STI, he can get it done himself as a simpler procedure.",

I was harassed thru school for it until I gave up and dyed it black, cause that was the only color that covered everything; I was born 10 years too soon - it would have been a hit in the 00s and later. I tried ONCE to bleach it. That, kids, is when I learned just how much Irish blood I had. (89.9% according to DNA!) It turned *red*. Everything but the grey, white, and silver went RED. All the shades of red. If it had picked just one, I could have dealt, but basically every color went a different color, ranging from pale orange blonde to bright red-orange to auburn and almost burgundy. It did not look good on me. The colors clashed so hard with my skin tone that I immediately dyed it black again. Ended up green for a while, but even that was an improvement.",

My children say that if anyone has room to complain or use their condition as an excuse for poor behavior, it's me. I refuse to because I do not think that anyone's condition EVER justifies mistreating others in any way, shape, or form. It doesn't matter if you're in pain; it doesn't matter if you're going through a rough time; it doesn't matter if you're depressed; it doesn't matter if you've been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness - people do not deserve to be brought down to your misery.\n\nThat's the way I see it. I know I am miserable and my QoL is significantly low. But my responsibility is to make sure no one else gets to be brought down to feel that low by my own actions and to manage my own thoughts and behaviors and recognize that others do not deserve to have my unfortunate situation be thrust upon them.\n\nThat's why when I saw the comment of \"YTA, he has cancer!\" regardless of whether it was correct... it doesn't matter! Unless he had brain cancer that was eating away at the logic and problem-solving and emotional regulation parts of his brain, there is no earthly reason why that would ever be justification for harming anyone in *ANY* way.\n\nMy own personal opinion as a very, very chronically ill person.",

If a student gives you the wrong haircut at a *free* haircut event and your first move is trying to get the teacher's license revoked or the whole damn school shut down, your priorities are *fucked*. \n\nEvery perceived slight in your life does not entitle you to harm that person in return. Threatening someone's job and their ability to make a living in the future because their *student* did something shitty is despicable. I bet none of you have ever fucked up at work, right? Never missed anything or stepped away at the wrong moment? Right...\n\nThere's a difference between holding someone accountable and seeking revenge. I never said that student shouldn't be held accountable. Talk to the school, get some form of compensation, then leave them to handle their student. Why do you think the school wouldn't take care of a problem like that? Do you actually believe that school teaches students to lie to customers? Do you believe the state board would revoke a license or blacklist someone from getting licensed based solely on your phone call? What reality are you living in?",

A couple check-ins, sure. If the teacher wasn't there for the consult and the person didn't notice they were getting the wrong haircut until it was done, why would the teacher know to intervene?

She even failed to set the chair right, so the water from washing my hair dribbled down the length of my entire back. I wish I could say I told her and her teachers that she did a horrible job and I'm not satisfied at all, but alas I was a socially awkward young woman, who just went home in the autumn with my back wet under my jacket, and cried for at least an hour at home, before I allowed my boyfriend to take off my hat and take a look at my hair. Needless to say I haven't trusted any hairdresser since, and it was more than a decade ago. My younger sister studied as a hairdresser, so thanks to that I learned that this is incredibly common with hairdresser students. Thank god my sister hated the whole thing and never finished school, so she didn't actually become a hairdresser lol. Nice free haircut my ass. More like free ruining your hair ugh.",

I still, to this day, refuse to wear bangs.\n\nI *finally* got to the point where I just stopped taking care of it.... when I was 12. It was to the backs of my knees, and I just stopped brushing it, stopped washing it, everything, over Christmas break. I finally got my hair cut 2 days before school started back up when they realized that no amount of detangler was going to get those rats nests out. I went back to school with hair cut to the bottoms of my ears.\n\nI did eventually let it grow out on its own again, down to my shoulders or so, and kept it there for most of the rest of school. It's down to my butt right now, but I'm probably going to get it cut up to my shoulders again soon. I live in Florida, so I want it shorter and lighter, but still long enough to put up so I'm not forced to deal with it down. *laughs* Several years ago, I actually shaved mine down to a velvet fur, because it was so fucking hot down here.",

Went to the ER, they called in an expert, he looked at my foot for ten seconds, and said, \"yeah, that's a recluse bite. Doesn't look too bad, but there's not really all that much we can do.\" Total bill for the ER visit, which included that two-minute conversation with the doctor, a prescription for an antibiotic and some pain pills? $7200. Thankfully, I was on a PPO plan at the time, so I only had to pay the ER copay. Today, with my high-deductible plan, that same visit would run me about $5000.",

And why what you're saying isn't being honored as \"proof\" or \"evidence\"?\n\nIt's because it literally isn't. And I'll explain why: your evidence for this phenomenon is your nurse mother, correct? This is what she has witnessed. I have not only been in nursing, but am also a chronically ill person who was born sick and as such, was a pediatric patient. And around pediatric patients all my life.\n\nEven in nursing.\n\nAnd in my experience? I didn't see that. I saw sick children who wanted care and comfort and their safe person (in my case, my mother) to help comfort them in their time of need and sickness. Yes, there were a few entitled kids that got on my nerves and whom I seriously didn't want to be around - but they were very far from the majority.\n\nThat is my experience. Is it any less valid than your mother's? No. Is your mother's any less valid than mine? No. It's a few fallacies together - one is counting the hits and ignoring the misses. You remember the ones that stand out and not the unproblematic ones; and the other is confirmation bias. Your mother happened to be in situations where this was the case and so this was her perspective and the one she was left with; I happened to be in a position where that wasn't the case and I *could* come to the conclusion that that means that children are not, in fact, manipulative at all as pediatric patients.\n\nBut it doesn't work that way.\n\nI made a joke a long time ago that I'm still proud of to this day and it's relevant in this situation: anecdotal evidence is so useless that it's a literal joke in Russian. For those of whom do not know: \"anekdot\" is the word for \"joke\" in Russian.\n\nYou have examples. Not a pattern of evidence.",
