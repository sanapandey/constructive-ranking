If you feel something is missing there PM SuperBio and he'll have it added. \n\n* The next 5 tabs link directly to collections based on console and publisher, they include Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Sega, and the PC. \n\n* The last tab is the other tab, this is where you can find Retro games, defined by No-Intro and others as pre Gamecube and PS2 era. This tab exists to link to the large collections that No-Intro and various other groups have collected.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n**/r/ROMS Official Matrix server [Link](https://matrix.to/#/#romz:matrix.org)**\n\n* Go here if you need additional help with anything ROM or emulation related.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n     \n\n**Changelog:** \n\nRedid Megathread post on Reddit, hopefully this is a cleaner, easier to read version that isn't as confusing as the out of date changelog\n\nMoved the megathread to gitlab due to account issues on github, update your bookmarks accordingly.\n\nRestored the megathread on github, left the gitlab megathread link as a backup, both will be updated.",

The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.",

Find the Identifier as romolux said, then find the file you want to download, type in CMD or Terminal `ia download Identifier \"FILE NAME.jpg\"` make sure the file name is between quotes and that you included it's extension. Then just hit enter.  \n\n2. If the file is inside a folder it's almost the same thing, but you add the folder name first, followed by a / (the folder name is inside the same quotes as the file name) `ia download Identifier \"Folder Name/FILE NAME.jpg\"`\n\nI must say though, that the speed increase wasn't much for me.

It'll then place a file on your desktop called \"archiveorglinks.txt\" with all of the links of the ROM's, that you can then either go through and either pick out ones you want or select all of them and then load into \"Free Download Manager\" to handle the downloads for you. You get faster downloads this way and can leave it alone while it does its thing. I hope this is helpful :)\n\n`$rooturl = \"https://archive.org/download/nointro.n64/\" #change to archive's root directory, ensure trailing slash exists`\n\n`$links = (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $rooturl).Links |`\n\n`Where-Object {($_.innerHTML -ne \"View Contents\") -and ($_.href -notlike \"*Europe*\") -and ($_.href -notlike \"*Japan*\") -and ($_.href -notlike \"*Germany*\") -and ($_.href -notlike \"*France*\") -and ($_.href -like \"*.7z\")} |`\n\n`Select-Object -ExpandProperty href`\n\n`$URLs = @()`\n\n`$desktop = [Environment]::GetFolderPath(\"Desktop\")`\n\n`$savefile = \"$desktop\\archiveorglinks.txt\"`\n\n`foreach ($link in $links){`\n\n`$URLs += $rooturl + $link`\n\n`}`\n\n`$URLs | Out-File -FilePath $savefile`\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*EDIT\\*  \nIf you come across an archive that doesn't have 7zip files, replace the last filter \"($\\_.href -like \"\\*.7z\")\" with the appropriate extension of the archive files, ie. \"($\\_.href -like \"\\*.zip\")\" for zip files.",

Also worth noting that the 360 launched in 2005 alongside a component cable allowing 1080p output; HDMI had only been shipping on consumer HDTVs for about a year, and was only on **very** expensive TVs at the time. Most folks I knew with 360s - including myself - were still rocking composite or _maybe_ S-video connections in 2005.\n\n3) There a bunch of games besides _Halo_ that are worth playing, and _Halo Reach_ being \"not DOOM\" doesn't stop it from absolutely being an S-tier FPS. /u/CoronaFatBoi listed a bunch of good ones: _Ninja Gaiden/Black_ and _II_, _Infinite Undiscovery_, _Lost Odyssey_ (which I'm playing now and it's great), the _Gears of War_ series (some of the best co-op out there), and the _Fable_ series. I'll add to that the unparalleled _Project Gotham Racing_ series, _Alan Wake_, the excellent _Guardian Heroes_ remake on XBLA, and _Ninja Blade_ on the 360, plus _Panzer Dragoon Orta_, _Jet Set Radio Future_, and _Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic I_ and _II_ from the OG Xbox, playable on the 360. Also the 360 generally had the better ports of cross-platform titles, with higher resolutions and/or framerates, so things like the _Max Payne_ series, the first three _Splinter Cell_ games, _Dead Space_, _Oblivion_ (and _Morrowind_ via BC), etc., all play better on 360 (though that advantage obviously goes away once we start talking emulation).\n\n4) Just because one thing sold better than another doesn't mean it is objectively better in any sense. The OG Game Boy sold 120M units, and the GBA only 80M; is it worse? _Wii Fit/Plus_ is the [8th best-selling game of all time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games), and _Metal Gear Solid_ doesn't crack the top 50. And in this case, it's really close, 87M for the PS3 and 84M for the Xbox 360... both compared to 101M for the Wii.\n\nIn general I think this is a silly argument, because both consoles have some great exclusives and both are a lot of fun. That said, the 360 was a _lot_ of folks' machine back in the day, partly because of the games, partly because of Xbox Live, and partly because it launched both a full year earlier and $200 cheaper ($300/400 instead of $500/600 like the PS3; in 2021 dollars, that's $405/539 vs $673/808!).",

The PS3 definitely had more potential and you can see it in games that used it, like Naughty Dog's stuff, but when comparing game performance between the two consoles, the 360 is usually better. I think part of that is the PS3 had less memory than the 360 because it was split between the game and the system/dash, which causes some issues in bigger (often open world) games like Skyrim and RDR. I do agree that the PS3 was better by the end of the generation, even better if you consider how easy it is to mod them. All my PS3s are modded but I've never bothered to mess with the 360s because they're a pain to open up and don't have any soft mods.\n\nIt's kinda the opposite of the last gen, where the PS4 had a distinct performance advantage over the Xbox One (until the Xbox One X at least).",

Whether or not I play or download all these ROMs, I still intend on buying a 2nd disk shelf and eventually having a 240TB array in my rack by the end of next year.

I got a Wii U, I installed Tiramisu, but since I own only a Mac I cannot use this USB Helper tool that everyone apparently is using. The only way I managed to get some games working was with Loadline GX2 playing directly without installation, but in order for this to work I need the game unpacked in \"Code\", \"Content\" and \"Meta\" state. I only found one torrent tracker that had several roms in Loadline GX ready format, but I cannot find much else and even then most of them go black screen on me and don't load. \n\nThat being said could you help me with a workaround for installing games without USB Helper (it does not run on a Mac, I tried many times with Wine, Crossover and other) or if there is no option for me to install games, at least do you know where I could find games on a Loadline GX friendly format?",

Also thanks for being understanding.\n\nThe same also applies to any MSU1 collections hosted on Archive by the same people who curate these cherrypicked collections that don't provide the proper credits, but we haven't done the same thing for MSU1 as we have with MD+. The database is quite large at this stage and it would be time consuming, so nobody has been motivated enough to do a complete collection. If we ever do I'll let you know. The vast majority of developers of MSU1/MD+ patches originate at a forum called Zeldix.\n\nCheers!",

For those who don't know what Triforce is [here is quote from the Dolphin Wiki](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Triforce) \n\n> The Triforce is an arcade system board developed jointly by Namco, Sega, and Nintendo, with the first games appearing in 2002. The name \"Triforce\" is a reference to Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series of games, and symbolized the three companies' involvement in the project. The system hardware is based on the Nintendo GameCube with several differences, like provisions for add-ons such as Sega's GD-Rom system, NAND memory, and upgradeable RAM modules. As with most arcade systems, each Triforce game has its own custom peripherals and functions.",

Had all of the versions released at the same time instead of being separated over time, they probably all would've used the new engine and sprites. I would prefer to think of them more raw.\n\nIn Japan you got two main series games and a third improved main series game.In US you got two main series games using the improvements of the third game while still being the first two just with the third's improvements. This is partially backed up by the fact that the US remakes are FireRed and LeafGreen.\n\nOfcourse in reality this is all subjective and the best alternative would be to include both the JP and US releases sense in the end, the gen 1 version differences for the main games are equivalent if not more than the version differences.",

Subsequently, the ISP would have to be aware of what you're downloading. Furthermore, the ISP must understand the legality of blocking someone's Internet, or they risk facing numerous class-action suits. Additionally, many websites generate links for a limited time and don't necessarily permit re-downloading. The file naming occurs on your computer, etc. I believe people tend to panic more than the situation warrants.",

Also I don't know if this matters but I do intend on using a rare candy code in the game so i don't have to grind for hours. I don't know if that matters in anyway to my problem but I wanted to state that. Thanks sorry for asking but I don't relay understand and would like to know and be able to navigate my self through roms and emulators.  Thanks",

Apart from manually clicking then? Like a way to bulk select? Some mentioned jdownloader? Any other recommendations on how to do it?\n\nAlso I did get a ps1 ebook that listed every ps1 game released in a compilation. Is there any suitable websites that categories all the old console systems e.g. GBA, ps1, and then say exploring other platforms like super neo geo or SNES?  Like a way of filtering almost like buying games by genre e.g. if searching for all the RPGs on the platform? I haven't played slots of platforms so without knowing the titles from heart wondering how best to window shop vs randomly downloading or googling title by title?\n\nBesides the megathread and that vimmslair or the like is there any other easy to use site for specific platforms where one can easily direct download without fear of malware and other mass advertising /click bait ? These two are pretty extensive. Emuparadise is mentioned a fair bit but as a newbie not sure how said links can be reactivated...",

The Megathread for mame and neogeo games is so confusing. I've read on Retropie that I need complete sets to run Arcade because they all basically run off of each other. Can someone tell me what I need to do to get a set. If I'm in violation of the thread can someone please private message me the answer? Id really appreciate it. Cheers",

Do these hack alter the original Rom to work on PAL as well or is there another work around?\n\nFor example Smash remix is formatted for NTSC, so I need a NTSC version of Super Smash Bro to combine it with. Is there a particular program or setting I need when modifying the rom to make it PAL friendly.\n\nIs there a was to keep it all all NTSC, outputting my Super 64 cartridge in NTSC mode and changing the Hertz on my 2000s TV to accept it?\n\nI would very much appreciate some advice.\nThanks.\n\nPs I have the expansion pack.",

Currently using an iPhone and just wanted to get a few games to keep me interested on long days whilst I\u2019m travelling.\n\nAny help you can lend is appreciated and apologies if this seems like an obvious and easily answered question, just thought it best to double check and ask the question first.

The whole point of having this megathread is to provide a safe way to download ROMS.\n\nOn a side note, if you're downloading smaller ROMs I'd recommend Vimm's Lair, I've used it for years and never had any issues and it is STRONGLY recommended by most. It does limit download speeds though, so I only really use it for handheld and/or retro ROMs. The UI is great and it has safe files. \n\nI've used this sub to get larger ROMs for a while now and never had any issues, so you'll be fine.",

Also they lag when you drag them into vt, I have a clean fireRed GBA file and it doesn't do that. They're also both smaller in file size than my fireRed GBA.

The 3 part USA Redump collection of PS2 games has naming errors that make it difficult/impossible to convert them to CHD. The ISO's in the collection convert fine, but 90% of the Cue/Bin files have been renamed in such a way that the conversion program can't match them. To fix this, you open the Cue file in Notepad, check what the title of the game is in there, and either rename that to the container title, or rename the container title to what's in Notepad.\n\nOr do what I did, and redownload your entire PS2 collection using the 5 part USA Redump ISO collection, which all work and convert fine.",

            "body": "I'm a novice myself, but if i understand your question correctly, you want to know how to run the games after having downloaded them and if the process works on iphone? Well from the little knowledge i have:\n\nI don't think emulating a game is possible on ios. I have zero experience with iphones but the following advice is for emulating in general.\n\nFirst things first, to be able to run the games you want, you need to download the proper **emulator** (which is essentially software/app especially designed to act like a console on your device, usually pc or android). After that, you need to download and add the proper **BIOS files** to your emulator (they can be found on the megathread), otherwise even after having downloaded the game files from this thread you wouldn't be able to open them properly.\n\nThere are many different software options depending on the console you want to emulate, so try to search them up on reddit/forums. Just to give you a few examples : I use Duckstation for PS1, i also know of mednafem (various consoles), PPSSPP for PSP, PSCX2 for PS2, Yuzu and Ryunjinx for Nintendo Switch etc.\n\nBut i think most of them are only available on pc, and maybe android as apk files. Additionally, from what i understand you can't really download apps/apks from third parties on ios, they have to come from the app store. Maybe there are some tricks to bypass that (not gonna mention jailbreaking bc i know nothing about how to do it, how risky it is and bc i think it makes you unable to use apple's guarantee, returning and maintenance services anymore etc.), or maybe there are some \"official\" app store emulators but even then, would they even be compatible with the roms in this thread? i have no idea.\n\nSo my advice would be to stick to emulating on pc if you have one, windows works with everything (i think a few emulators work on mac os if you have one but macbooks aren't known for their proficiency in gaming so idk if it's worth trying).",
