The GB games were gone from the market, even though the GBA was retrocompatible.\n\nAs long as switch games are on the shelves and (virtual-)stores, they are current gen.\n\n> So you can't keep saying that the old Switch is a Current Console after Switch 2 Release.\n\nOf course we can. As you can disagree.\n\n> I wonder why Rom Gitlab and Myrient are exist if they don't support future Games.\n\nThey probably will, if they can muster the storage required. Myrient is a archival endeavour, not a piracy den.\n\nConsidering the fact that NSW is currently active on the scene... all games from it are piracy. \n\nConsidering the fact that PS4 is currently active on the scene, all games from it are piracy.\n\nTL;DR: As long as [insert console name] games are being sold, [insert console name] is considered current gen and as thus piracy, being subjected by rule 3.",
