You need to click on the arrow on the left of the `<form action=\"//dl3.vimm.net/\" method=\"POST\" id=\"dl_form\" onsubmit=\"return submitDL(this, 'tooltip4')\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"mediaId\" value=\"6462\">`\n\n[Open the \\<form\\> block](https://preview.redd.it/v0pmq20amgpe1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a4e58456c0919a953f651ca8b33604eb6e496fa)\n\n7. You will see 2 hidden inputs with mediaId value, as its a simple HTML form it's lacking the simple submit button. Right Click on the <form> code and select \"Edit as HTML\"\n\n[Edit as HTML the form code](https://preview.redd.it/hbn0ynsjmgpe1.png?width=530&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdaef33b50c93d067706c4a2912d60c87a614f0f)\n\n8.

IMPORTANT! Here after the second <input> paste following code `<button type=\"submit\" style=\"width:100%\">Download</button>` \n\n[That how it should look after pasting \\<button\\> code](https://preview.redd.it/h47f6ov0ngpe1.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e2cf167eb36507146d80f613837d760aef78d48)\n\n10.
