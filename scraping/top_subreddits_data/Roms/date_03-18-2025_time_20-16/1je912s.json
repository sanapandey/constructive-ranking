A specific game would be like the old transformers games that have been delisted and you can't purchased. People would consider that abandoned.  I'm not looking for it i just wondered if others got it from the MT or other sites. There are whole sites called abandoned ware I believe even someone posted one. He didn't ask anything either just posted a site no fuss like the rest of the comments and down voters lol",

You ask a dumb, vague question and then act like an ass when people perceive your question as dumb and vague.\n\nHell, you could try to use your empty head and think. Is this console still officially selling the games? Unless you're looking at the PS3/360 generation, the answer is usually no unless it's a case where, for example, the modern Xbox consoles also sell some original Xbox games too. If the game is not located on those marketplaces then, surprise, they're abandonware.",
