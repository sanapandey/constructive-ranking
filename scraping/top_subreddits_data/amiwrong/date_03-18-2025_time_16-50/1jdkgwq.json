    "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9 and I have been together for 4 years. He was out at a bar last night and ran into an old fling and her new spouse. Him and the spouse hit it off apparently. He started the conversation with me saying.... I don't know how to say this but I ran into a friend tonight and her partner and I think we should all hang out. I could tell by how he started the conversation that this was clearly someone he had a past with. He admitted to them sleeping together several times before him and I started dating and that it had been a few years since he's seen her. I asked him if her spouse knew they use to hook up ( to which he clearly didn't) and if he honestly thought that would be a good idea. He got angry with me and said I just don't like anyone and he won't ever bring it up again. Mind you this is the same partner that freaks out if my child's father calls or txt me. Nor has he ever mentioned this person at all. And he didn't exchange numbers with the boyfriend. He exchanged numbers with her..... ",

If he has a problem with your ex calling especially regarding your child, he has no business asking you to hang out with his ex.\u00a0\n\n\nThe fact that he makes problems when you have to talk to your ex for a perfectly good and acceptable reason would really make me rethink the relationship.",

He clearly reaaaaaaally wants to hang out with her. I wonder why. And he even went ahead and exchanged numbers with his ex fling, nice!!!
