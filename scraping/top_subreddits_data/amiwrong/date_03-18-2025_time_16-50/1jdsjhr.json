    "selftext": "Throw away account. We just had our baby 5 months ago. Before that we both worked full time but since I was working from home I (F27) was doing most of the housework. I'm now on maternity leave. My husband (M38) goes to work but travels leaving me alone. Am I wrong to expect him to sometimes help me out? The reason I'm asking is last night I was so tired so l asked him to cook. He said he is not vacation (he meant maternity leave) like me and he goes to work everyday to provide for us and he wants to rest on the weekends. I told him I understand but I really don't have energy since I woke up many times the night before to feed the baby. He ended up ordering food for himself and ignoring me for the whole night. This morning he again mentioned that it's unfair that I'm expecting him to help out at home when I'm the one l'm vacation. I got really mad  and said it's not a vacation and caring for the baby is a full time job plus I\u2019m doing all the housework. He rolled his eyes and left the room. Our relationship has been rocky since I gave birth. Is this normal? He has been complaining a lot about lack of intimacy but l'm all alone and tired. \n",

These men choose younger women because they are less experience and stay through these men's bs longer than women their age would have done. \n\nHowever, it's not normal for functional relationships where both people see each other as equal partners, want to support each other and want themselves and the other to live their best life.\n\nHe's been complaining about lack of intimacy because he assumed that, as a woman, it's your job to care for the house on your own, care for the baby on your own and serve his needs.

I would say that if you're gonna live as a single mom in more ways that I can count, you might as well do it with less food to cook, less messes to clean up and without a big baby with long legs and long arms demanding sex.\n\nNTAH.\n\nPlease, girls, stop getting married in your 20s to misogynistic men in their 30s/40s. Stop having their babies. You're nothing but bangmaids to them.\n\nDear lord.",
