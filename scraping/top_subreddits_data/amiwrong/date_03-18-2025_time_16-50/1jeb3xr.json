    "selftext": "I (25M) am friends with a girl (23F) who *might* be into me. \n\nI met her at a bar recently with my other female friend and we all had fun. 2 weeks later, at her request, I hung out with her at another bar with my girlfriend (24F). This girl and my girlfriend\u2026 didn\u2019t get along. Not that they don\u2019t like each other, but that this girl mostly talked to me, didn\u2019t ask my gf for her instagram, phone number, etc. We all chatted a bit but it was clear to my gf that I was the center of attention here.\n\nFlash forward and my girlfriend was upset and kind of suspicious of her. We had an issue like this before because my gf\u2019s best friend tried to sleep with me a while ago and this caused a rift in our relationship. I told her everything was fine and not a big deal.\n\nSo this new friend invited us to her birthday party and I gave my gf her number to text her. This friend replied to all my texts but never texted my gf back and at the party barely talked to her, only me. Am I treading a line here?\n\nTL/DR: friends with a girl who might be into me, worried I\u2019m taking this too far",
