    "selftext": "Going to try to give you each side as objectively as possible. \n\nMy wife is a little emotionally immature. Her family lives across the country, and doesn\u2019t visit often. Her dad recently came and we had a great visit. When he left, she broke down. She has daddy issues and this factors a lot into the equation. There\u2019s trauma and unresolved childhood issues wrapped in this.\n\nI, on the other hand, am pretty even-keel. Not  unemotional by any means. In fact, I think I tend to lean emotional, but am more down to earth. While she is sad and becomes anxious by the possibility she might never see him again, I would be sad but reason that it\u2019s life\u2026 and I will see him again soon.\n\nAnyways\u2026 it\u2019s not that she wants a hug and is sad for 20 minutes. The world stops that day\u2026 she mopes and writes in her journal\u2026 she has to talk with friends on the phone about it\u2026 it\u2019s a thing\u2026 sometimes for more than on day.\n\nThen, she gets mad at me for not being there for her. Again, I am\u2026 but for like what I feel is a reasonable amount of time. After that, it\u2019s not like I scold her for it\u2026 I just go about my life. She needs the validation or something. Again\u2026 lot wrapped into this with the daddy issues. \n\nSelfishly, I also don\u2019t want to get mixed up with the daddy issues or any of her family issues. I\u2019m here for support, but I have a long history of consuming my SO\u2019s problems and making them my own\u2026 to the point it\u2019s unhealthy for me. I do my best to avoid that, or at least reserve it for when it\u2019s necessary. \n\nAm I wrong for letting her feel this on her own?\n",

You can only support for her for however long YOU think is a reasonable time to be upset?? \nIs that 30 mins? 1hour? 2 hours? How long do YOU feel she's allowed to grieve the loss of her dad? How long do YOU think is long enough for her to be upset before you think she's got to \" get over it.\"? \n\nYour opinion on how long is a reasonable amount of time to grieve her dad leaving, not knowing when she'll see him again, worried if he may pass away and that visit would be their last. Missing being able to be physically with him to hug him and spend quality time with him. Your opinion on how long she should be sad for is IRRELEVENT. \n\nHer feelings are the only ones that matter in this situation. She is the one losing someone she loves, and doesn't know the next time she'll see him. Of course she's going to be devastated, and you can't just get over that in 1hour or 2 hours. \n\nI lost my dad a couple of years ago, and we were extremely close, strong bond, and I cared for him throughout his dementia journey. I miss him every single day and wish I could just hold him and hug him again. \nAlthough her dad is still alive, she still has daily grief over not being able to see him regularly and do things together, and have a hug from him when she's going through a difficult time etc. \n\nHave you lost someone you love? Are your parents alive, and do they live close by that you're able to see them easily? Are you close to your parents? \nIf you're close to your parents and see them frequently, you can't begin to understand how being away from her father deeply hurts her. \nAnd if you don't have a close bond with your parents you can't begin to understand the devastation of being away from them. \n\nI'm also curious as to why you live far away from her family? Did you have to move away for your job? Did her dad move away? If you chose to move far away from her family/ or your family, then you need to appreciate the sacrifice she's made for you leaving her loved ones so far away. (If you play a role in why he's not close by) \n\nBut really, why can't you just be there for your wife for 1 day of sadness? Why do you feel she's too overly emotional? It kind of says more about you than it does about her. \nIt's how's how deeply shelves and misses herdad, and how much she treasures the time with him, and how devastating it is when he leaves. But it seems to imply like you're quite unattached and don't have that kind of close relationship with your family as you can't even try and imagine how upsetting it is for her to say goodbye. \n\nShe's allowed to be upset and sad and struggle to say goodbye for another long period of time. And as her husband, I don't understand why you can't support her for 1 day. Just know that for the day he leaves, she'll need support and comfort and maybe some distractions, maybe go for a walk together or go do something to try and ease her mind. Cuddle up on the sofa and watch some films etc. \n\nIt's sad that you feel comforting your wife for 1 day is too much of a big ask and that you feel it's an over reaction. Your role as a husband is to be there for her through difficult times, but you're literally deciding yourself what you think is an appropriate time for HER to feel sad about saying goodbye to her dad. \n\nI think you need to look at yourself and your actions and try to be more supportive and understanding. \nIt doesn't matter if YOU think she's upset for too long, it matters how she feels and how it's affecting her to have to say goodbye. \n\nYou need to step up your support and understanding, because I guarantee that when the day comes that she loses her dad for good, she will be grieving so much worse and that kind of grief never ends.",
