    "selftext": "\n\nMy (22f) fiance (27m) and I met when I was 19. He's the love of my life in many ways. We share similar interests and both get along good for the most part. We live in a small studio, and have been having issues finding a bigger apartment in our city for months now. We are doing a month-to-month situation with our landlord. The space is way too small. But I don't know whats headed next. \n\nWe both don't have college degrees and work blue collar jobs we haven't dedicated years to. And can easily find in another state. \n\nWe met online, and before we even met in person (within the first month) we talked about van life, and taking a year road trip around the country. I told him for years that I don't plan on staying in our state forever. And once I'm able to, I'd like to move down south.  He gave me the impression that his dream was to live nomadically for a while, so I assumed he was up for relocating eventually in the beginning of our relationship. \n\nHe heard this, and has been open to the idea. He's even looked into houses down where I was thinking of moving.  And has expressed excitement. But this was a year ago at this point. \n\nI come from a broken home/family and want to leave the city that I associate with my childhood and trauma. I've been no contact and low contact with them for two years at this point. \n\nI want to start new. He comes from a big family and friends and said now it's going to be hard for him to leave all he's ever known. I've tried to discuss thinking of moving once we get married this year, but he won't give me a straight answer. \n\nHe doesn't know when he wants to. And seems reluctant. I understand that. I would never force him to. But I just thought we were on the same page. \n\nI have almost 100k saved in the bank.  (Some I've saved working, and the rest I came into unexpectedly this year) I'm able to financially. I told him I'd financially do it. But I think it's emotionally for him. \n\nThis has always been a dream for me. It's not like I just sprung this on him. I just don't know if I'm unreasonable for feeling uneasy about the lack of planning for the next steps. I want to leave here so bad. I'm unhappy. But I'd feel so guilty leaving. We also have a cat together who is extremely bonded to me. I don't know what to do.  I didn't go to college though. \n\nFor clarification, I don't plan on doing van life now. I want to move across the country now. I'm ready. We talked about van life in the beginning and it is still something I'm open to in the future ",

Just because he said he might be interested in a temporary van life at some point doesn't mean he would be willing to permanently relocate.\n\nYou said it's your dream, right? Maybe he doesn't see that as something that needs to become a reality or thought it might be a deal breaker for you. You could start more realistic planning to leave and letting him know, \"look, I'm looking to move here, I've been researching the job market there, here's my timeline, etc.\" I think once you start showing him this isn't \"just a dream\", but something that is going to concretely happen, he'll be more real with you about his feelings. Or, maybe you could just sit him down and say that?",
