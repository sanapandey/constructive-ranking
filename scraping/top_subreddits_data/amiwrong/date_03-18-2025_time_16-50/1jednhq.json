    "selftext": "met this guy on Reddit, and we instantly clicked. We had long, fun conversations for almost two months. I was the one who added him first, but after that, he was always the one initiating. Sometimes, though, he'd just disappear in the middle of a conversation or take a while to reply, which made me feel like the interest wasn\u2019t mutual. I still don\u2019t know if it was, but what I do know is that he was aware I liked him. And whenever he initiated, I always matched his energy.\n\nEventually, I asked for his Instagram, and we started talking there. One day, while chatting, he told me that all online conversations eventually fade out, and so will this one. That completely threw me off. I got confused and didn\u2019t know what he meant. It felt like he was either preparing me for him to ghost me or just downplaying whatever connection we had before anything could even happen.\n\nI asked him what he meant, but his explanation was vague and didn\u2019t clarify how he actually saw me. He said something about us ending up as strangers and even joked that I might inspire him to write a song one day. He could tell I was confused by what he was saying, yet he still doubled down on it\u2014offering no explanation beyond that\u2019s just the rational reality.\n\nThat moment stuck with me. After a few more conversations, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I was investing in something that wasn\u2019t real.It felt like I was holding onto something one-sided and that he was so ready/okay to just let go. \n\nSo, I decided to be direct and told him we shouldn\u2019t talk anymore. I didn\u2019t want to play guessing games.\n\nNow, I\u2019m wondering\u2014was I too quick to cut him off? Or was that comment a red flag, and I made the right choice?",
