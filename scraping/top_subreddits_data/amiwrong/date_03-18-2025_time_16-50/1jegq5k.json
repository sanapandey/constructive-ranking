    "selftext": "\n\nMy gym crush and I (27F) had a few conversations in the past, all initiated by him. He wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone else, seemed pretty introverted, so him approaching me made me think that he could be interested in a friendship, at least. I\u2019d always keep the conversation going to show him I liked talking to him. \n\nFor a whole month, he stopped coming to the gym, and I started to wonder if he had switched to a different one. Still, I hoped I\u2019d run into him again. I have terrible social anxiety, and I regretted not asking for his name when I had the chance.\n\nAfter two months of not seeing him, I finally moved on\u2026 until I stumbled across his profile on Instagram. The gym\u2019s page follows him, so his account popped up as a suggested follow.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to seem like a creep, so I thought it through carefully. Eventually, I decided to follow him. But then\u2026 he declined my request and sent me a follow request instead!! It wasn\u2019t just that he ignored my request \u2014he actively declined it right away. What? I mean, one usually checks the other person\u2019s profile first and then decides what to do: either accept or decline.\n\nI didn\u2019t message him because, well, he rejected my request. I don\u2019t want to come across as pushy or anything.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m just waiting for him to unfollow me. I\u2019ve never had this happen before \u2014has it ever happened to you? I feel a little shitty rn.",
