    "selftext": "Okay long story short, we f'd up our first born and let her sleep with us. Fast forward 6 years she's basically unwilling to sleep in her own bed. My wife is on team 'it's fine just let her sleep with us' and doesn't see anything wrong with it. I'm obviously not. Well I was fine with it, but now I'm not. \n\nMeanwhile our second kid has been properly sleep trained and **WAS** sleeping in her own room until she got old enough to realize she's getting left out. Now she wants to sleep with us and it's turning into an issue for me. \n\nThis has been going on for a long time now, maybe a year or so both girls are in bed with us. So for the last 3 months or so, I've been sleeping in my daughters room, while my wife and the two kiddos sleeps in our room. I bought a new twin sized hybrid mattress from Purple (it's a super nice bed BTW, I recommend it) and figured, hey when she sleeps in here she'll love it. \n\nNow I'm to the point I'm fed up and basically said the girls have to sleep in their own rooms. I want my room back, my wife back, etc. \n\nMy wife says it will happen, they'll grow out of it, what's wrong with it, etc. She's not budging and loves that the girls want to sleep with us. She said when the girls get older they'll want to sleep in their own rooms and want nothing to do with us so why not enjoy it now. \n\nI get her side of things, but I'm also struggling to get a good nights rest because kids don't sleep like adults. \n\nSo I'm asking, \"Am I wrong for wanting the girls to be in their own room?\" Is it wrong for me to not take advantage of this time with the kiddos knowing that they'll eventually have their own lives where their parents aren't as important. Should I be super happy with this and accept it. Or should I stick to my guns and have the girls sleep in their own room. I mean it's not really hurting anything really. As far as I can tell. I don't know. I just don't like it I guess. ",

I pulled a mattress out from under each twin bed at night and two of the kids slept in beds, the younger two slept on twin or crib mattresses on the floor. In the morning they got kicked back under the beds. \n\nThey each technically had their own room, but they all slept in the youngest\u2019s room. As the kids got older, the sometimes opted to sleep in their own rooms, but they always had the option of going into the shared room if they wanted to at night (instead of the parents room!). Kids felt safe, parents got left alone. \n\nI will note that more time is needed for them to settle down before bed if you go this route. They will eventually settle down, but I put the kids to bed much earlier than they really needed to be asleep, to leave time for some pre-sleep chaos. I turned off the lights, turned on their nightlight projector and music, and they\u2019d still chat and play for about an hour before falling asleep, even after I read them stories. This was their method, they weren\u2019t my kids, and with fewer kids or kids that have dedicated gross motor play before bed, you might not need the buffer, but just wanted to give you a heads up you might need it!",

We have two little ones 10 and 6.\n\nI think a few things are at play. Your wife is focused on the sleep issue, but for you it is about much more than sleep here. It is about your intimacy, closeness, and togetherness with your wife. \n> As a guy it's not enough for me.\nMany of us men link sex and love. Personally, in my marriage, the more physical intimacy we are having, the closer I feel to my wife. Often that physical intimacy is sex, but things like hugs, kisses, backrubs, just general snuggling all make me feel closer to her.\n\nTaking a big step back, I'm wondering if your wife has expressed that she is *touched out* to you if you are trying to initiate physical intimacy (not even in a sexual way, just in a physical sense)?\n\nI'm wondering how old your little ones are and if you and your wife both work outside the home as well? \n\nHaving your kids in your bed is a surefire way to get to that *touched out* space because kids need physical touch on a whole different level than adults do as well. Hugs are important!\n\nIt will take a lot to suggest a change to your wife and she may just feel it coming from a \"this dude just wants more sex\" perspective.\n\nWhen we were planning on having kids, my wife and I talked about ensuring that our relationship was the strongest and we maintained our bond becuase without us, there'd be no kids anyway. If you and your wife have had that type of conversation before kids, it could be a time to return to that conversation. Not in an accusatory manner, but in a sharing your perspective. There's a good conflict resolution strategy called [D-E-A-R-M-A-N](https://dbt.tools/interpersonal_effectiveness/dear-man.php) that I'm a big fan of.\n\nOur boys slept in a bassinet by the bed until they were about 6ish months old and then transitioned to their bedrooms with monitors. They are welcome to come to Mom and Dad's room at night if they need us. When they've had nightmares, sickness, etc they might end up in our bed, but generally they are in their rooms.\n\nThey still need/want and love to snuggle us as well. They didn't *lose* anything or time missed. Our youngest sometimes wants me to sleep with him, so I'll lay down, tickle his back, and sing him a song. He drifts off to sleep and I'll head out of his room. In the morning he tells me he liked me helping him get to sleep.",

The kids are learning codependency on others, and sleeping in their own rooms is one of the first steps in teaching them how to manage themselves without being entirely dependent on other people to cope. They\u2019re developing a fear of being alone, and that can become really unhealthy as adults. When they get older, they may not be as dependent on you, but they might shift to becoming dependent on partners and friends, and that can lead to unhealthy relationships. Fear of being alone can lead people to stay in bad relationships simply because they don\u2019t know how to cope on their own. \n\nI\u2019m not saying this will definitely be the case with your kids, but it\u2019s a strong possibility, and if they don\u2019t learn how to handle themselves at these early development ages it could potentially be setting them up for long term problems in adulthood. \n\nPerhaps you could suggest starting out with them sharing a room together for now, so they\u2019re not making the switch to sleeping alone too abruptly, and will have each other until you\u2019re able to start adjusting them to their own rooms again. You need your rest too. You can\u2019t be your best self for your children if you\u2019re constantly exhausted. You also can\u2019t be fully present in the moments you want to remember in the future if you\u2019re fatigued and stressed. I live with chronic fatigue from MS, and honestly the brain fog that causes has made me feel like I can\u2019t remember half my life, even important moments I really want to hold onto. \n\nI understand why your wife wants to continue on like this, wanting to keep her kids close at night is a powerful feeling, but while the short term seems like it\u2019s benefitting the kids, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re hard to say no to, it\u2019s not really helping them develop into healthy adults, and it\u2019s causing you excessive fatigue and now straining her relationship with you too. The only person benefitting from this situation in the long term is her, so while her intentions may be good, it\u2019s ultimately a selfish decision on her part.",

Check out r/sciencebasedparenting if you\u2019re interested in the data of the matter. \n\nI think this is an interesting discussion though, because there are benefits to letting small children sleep in bed, but they\u2019re also needs to be boundaries\u2014 because adults need their sanity intact, first and foremost, or they won\u2019t be able to parent very well. \n\nMy kid is a hybrid- goes to sleep on their own, then moves into the bed with me. There is some research that shows this is good in terms of forming a healthy attachment. \n\nBut the key element here is that it\u2019s working for our marriage, and WE are able to sleep well. Recently, I\u2019ve had trouble being woken up by the kiddo, so that is my parameter for transitioning into their own room. \n\nAgain , there isn\u2019t a right way or a wrong way, and it is not a black-and-white situation. I believe most kids want to transition into their \u201cbig kid\u201d room in early toddlerhood\u2014  if they are left to their own devices. However, if parent is interfering and causing them to fear moving into their own room, that\u2019s another issue. \n\nUltimately, my husband and I also prioritize each other\u2019s wellbeing. I believe to have a healthy marriage and be healthy parents\u2014 that putting each other first is what allows us to both put our child first.

This just confused him and I had to put my foot down, make a strict routine and say he sleeps alone.\n\nWe all started sleeping better, but she resents me for it and blames me for being to strict with routine, always forgetting how tired and crazy (can\u2019t think of a nicer word for it) she had been.  \n\nShe will still try to sleep with him.
