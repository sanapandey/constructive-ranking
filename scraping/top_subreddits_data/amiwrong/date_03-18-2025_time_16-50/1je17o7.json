    "selftext": "my boyfriend (M23) and i (F22) have been together since last year july, i know almost every little thing about him and other people he\u2019s told me about. however, it has only been brought to my attention around a month ago that he\u2019s been in contact & is currently friends with a girl (F23) he\u2019s slept with in the past. \n\nwe\u2019re going to call this girl willow. willow and my boyfriend met around the age of 16 and have been what he would call it \u201ctight\u201d ever since then. he had faintly told me about her 2 months ago but i had NO idea that they\u2019ve had sex and what not. i ended up finding that information out myself when i went through his phone and found multiple texts exchanged between them. \n\nin their conversation, she had stated: \n\n\u201ci wonder what it would be like if we actually got together x\u201d and he replied \u201ci wonder that too x\u201d\n\nbut it didn\u2019t stop there. it just kept going. \n\n\u201cwe\u2019d probably have like 3 or 4 kids together by now, you would\u2019ve never met your partner (me) and we\u2019d most likely be married x\u201d she says. \n\n\u201cwe would x\u201d he says. \n\n\u201cyou know, i also had a dream about you. about being with you x\u201d he also adds.\n\nonce i read that, i couldn\u2019t even BARE to look at him. my nostrils were literally flaring, i could feel my face growing red and my eyes were stinging with tears. hours later, i ended up confronting him about it and he looked very much unbothered. he told me with a straight face: \u201cyou don\u2019t ever wonder what it would be like with someone else?\u201d \n\nLIKE WHAT? NO! I DON\u2019T BECAUSE I\u2019M WITH YOU! \n\nhe goes on to tell me what he meant about the \u201cdream\u201d he had of her and tells me that it was ages ago. he continues to tell me that they are just friends, nothing would ever happen between them. \n\nobviously i start to cry because i feel so overwhelmed by the situation and i\u2019m just hurt overall. whilst crying, i confront him about not telling me that he had slept with her and his excuse was: \u201ci thought i already told you?\u201d no, he didn\u2019t. \n\nin the end, he believed that i was overthinking the whole situation and that i\u2019m paranoid. \n\ndo i sound crazy? please let me know. \n\n",

If someone is going to cheat, they will find a way even if they aren\u2019t allowed to have attraction gender friends. And if someone won\u2019t cheat, being controlling only harms the relationship. \n\nBut this is not that. \n\nMy boundary isn\u2019t the friend\u2019s gender, but their shared romantic/sexual intimacy. I do draw the line at previous romantic or sexual partner. I don\u2019t believe you can be truly platonic with a past lover. And if that\u2019s not your cup of tea, then *adieu*.\n\nThis was probably platonic. However, if they didn\u2019t have a shared romantic history, this conversation wouldn\u2019t have happened because he wouldn\u2019t even bring this topic up with a platonic friend. \n\nBut Reddit can\u2019t answer if you\u2019re wrong for being upset about this because it\u2019s all about what you feel is right in a relationship. We can answer that him not being honest about her is a huge red flag and shows he isn\u2019t trustworthy and transparent about her.
