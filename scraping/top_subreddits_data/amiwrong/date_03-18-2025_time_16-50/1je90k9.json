    "selftext": "I live with my girlfriend and I've recently I've noticed I don't get a lot of time to myself and time to relax with my hobbies. One weekends my girlfriend and I tend to be busy and have plans and after work we're together and tend to either for out of stay home watching tv.\n\nI mentioned to my gf I was going to start staying up to play video games a few times a week just to have some time with hobbies without impacting our time together. She said she understood. The first time I did it it was fine and it was nice to have some time to myself.\n\nThe next time I planned to do it my partner said she had decided to stay up. I told her that's fine but I'll be putting my headset on and playing games. She kept trying to interrupt me and as soon as I got up to go to bed she did the same.\n\nI planned to stay up last night and when it came time that my gf and I normally go to bed she asked if I was getting ready for bed soon and I told her I'd be staying up. She then said she would stay up too.\n\nI asked why she had a problem with me staying up with out her. She denied having an issue but I just pointed out what she is doing now and what she did last time. I said she should be letting me have some space and should be respecting my time.\n\nShe said I was starting arguments over nothing and that she can stay up if she wants.\n\nAIW for staying up without my gf a few times a week?",

You are not wrong for staying up and you are not wrong, per say, if you \"ignore her\" during that time because you expressed your plans to stay up and why. Maybe ask her why she is choosing to stay up?",

You are even making sure it doesn't interfere with prime wake time - which is above and beyond.  If you want to take some alone time on ac Saturday afternoon that would be just as valid. \n\nShe needs to respect this healthy boundary. I'm not sure the best way to communicate that - only you really know her.  But it is one that is important to set now because it likely will only get worse.  And having time to yourself with no responsibility, expectations, or others to take into accountor consider is important and essential for long term relationship success. Everyone needs time to just be.\n\n *from a wife of 15 years and mother to 3*",

Suggest that she make time to do the same with her hobbies, because hobbies are important for everyone to have. In that same vein, you will not interrupt her hobbies except if necessary. Then....it all depends on her reaction. If she takes it well and has a mature conversation with you - great! If she gets defensive or upset and refuses to converse about it then....you have a few options: deal with it, break up, or get couples counciling. If you plan on staying with her, I'd suggest the latter option",

She doesn't feel comfortable going to bed alone (admittedly kinda dumb). She may also have an issue with your hobby itself (also dumb - her having an issue, not the hobby). \n\nUltimately, she needs to back off and give you your space. I've been with enough guys to know that you can't smother them like she is. It will ultimately foster resentment and leads to arguments, sometimes cheating and often break ups. I'd argue you set clear expectations and boundaries, and if she can't abide by those then maybe cut your losses and start looking for a new place to stay since it won't work out if she can't give you space when you want it. \n\nShe also sounds like she needs her own hobby. My hobby is gaming lol. Well that and my garden. But obviously I'm not going to garden at night. You might be able to work out a compromise with her if you change the timing of your gaming to another time of day, although I do question whether or not that would actually work or if she'd just keep trying to interrupt and get you to spend time with her. I suppose you could try and get her to do her own hobby while you do yours, but there's the real possibility that she has no hobby... or at least not one she can do on her own. Which really begs the question of whether or not this relationship is sustainable long-term and whether or not she has any personality outside of being a girlfriend.",
