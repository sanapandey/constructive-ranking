    "selftext": "TLDR: Me (21F) and my best friend (22F) We met in middle school at our Catholic school and became really close friends right away. We were often compared to Bella and Gigi Hadid. Our school was secluded and religious, so there was some drama, but nothing between us. Fast forward 13 years, we're both post-grads in our respective careers and still maintaining our friendship, with a few ups and downs along the way. I also had a cousin who was like a third member of our group, and the three of us were inseparable.\n\nOver the years, many people warned me about her, especially because of her bratty attitude during our adolescence. I thought she'd grow out of it, but I was wrong. I'm an extroverted people-pleaser, and I gave her the benefit of the doubt in so many situations\u2014like when she texted my ex behind my back, lied about it, and gaslit me. Once, when she was going through a breakup, she invited me to stay with her in another city, and even though it was a huge effort for me to make the trip, she had me sleep on the couch while she and her on-again, off-again boyfriend had loud sex.\n\nThe tipping point came when I traveled with her to her home country. We were in a small village, maybe 1,000 people, where no one spoke English, and she was our only translator\u2014something she constantly reminded us of like it was a huge chore.\n\nOne day, we stopped at a store to get snacks before our bus left for a new city in an hour. I accidentally left my phone behind, and a man from the store called out to us. I asked her to check what he was saying, but she ignored it. We reached the hotel, and I realized I had left my phone at the store. My cousin stayed behind to stall the bus driver while I asked my friend, who knew the language and had my location on Find My iPhone, to help me get my phone back.\n\nAs we walked back, I was panicking\u2014my phone had all my credit cards and important information. But halfway there, she suddenly stopped because she was scared of a dog in the street. I begged her to ignore it, but she refused to continue walking, saying she was going back to the hotel. She coldly responded, \u201cI\u2019m not the one who left my phone there,\u201d and walked off, leaving me stranded. I was alone, in a foreign village, with no phone, no directions, and no way to communicate. I know it was my mistake for leaving my phone, but accidents happen, and this was a friend I would\u2019ve done anything for. I had stayed with her the entire night of her 21st birthday, even though I don\u2019t drink, to make sure she got home safely, held her hair back while she vomited, and stopped her from getting into cars with strangers. All of that was reduced to this one moment.\n\nIn that moment, I found myself praying, something I never did before. I was desperate, but I eventually found the man who had been calling to me, and he had my phone, ready to return it.\n\nI\u2019m ashamed to admit it, but I stayed on that trip after everything that happened. There were more moments of her bratty, rude, and snarky behavior. I endured it for longer, until a couple of months ago, when I finally cut her off for good.\n\nShe was opportunistic\u2014she\u2019d copy the way I dressed, which I didn\u2019t mind, since I saw her as a sister. But she\u2019d also try to make my friends her friends, use my connections, and leave me out of things. Now, I\u2019m left with guilt and unsure how to move on without the closure I\u2019m craving. Also we have mutual friend and she\u2019s already led the conversation that I\u2019m the bad guy who broke things off. We\u2019ve known each other so long, am I overreacting ",

            "body": "You aren't wrong and closure...is overrated. In conversations like this, when one person is clearly still antagonistic, it usually just perpetuates that same loop of a conversation.\n\nShe's painting you as the bad person, so what do you gain by listening to her go after you more? She showed you who she was and you believed her - good for you. As for mutuals, well, if they think how she intentionally tried to avoid you from being reunited with your phone, or rather, her weaponizing that she knew the language, etc. and you didn't and tried to use that against you? They aren't much of friends, either.",
