    "selftext": "I (24F) was in a relationship for almost two years with my ex (24M). We had a loving and respectful relationship, but over time, I felt an emotional disconnect. While I always sought deep conversations and vulnerability, he often avoided those topics, or just didn't give them the importance i did, which made me feel unseen. We eventually broke up because we were in different emotional stages, and I felt he wasn\u2019t meeting me halfway, i didn't feel considered in his plans, short term and long term. It was a painful but mature breakup, and I truly loved him. A couple of months later, I made a mistake at a party. I was emotionally vulnerable, drank too much, and ended up kissing a friend (who, I later found out, had a girlfriend at the time). When my ex found out, he reacted with disappointment, saying, *\u201cIt doesn\u2019t justify and it\u2019s not fair.\u201d* Though we were no longer together, I felt judged and like I had tainted everything we had. Of course i apologized to the girlfriend and explained everything to her, because she reached out to me asking me what had happened, although she wasn't at the party, someone had told her what happened, and i later found out my ex was the one who told her... What hurt even more was how he completely distanced himself and, from what I\u2019ve heard, started villanizing me\u2014almost as if everything I had been in our relationship was erased by one mistake. To make things harder, we shared a close group of friends, so I had to navigate not only my own guilt and regret but also the way others looked at me. I hated the idea of people talking about it and twisting the situation, making me out to be someone I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve tried to find peace with it, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling of regret\u2014not just for my actions but for how this situation made me lose the chance of ever reconnecting with him in a meaningful way.\n\nNow, 6 months later, i still carry a bit of shame and a guilt that seems to not go away, even though i know my truth and i know that my intentions were never to hurt anyone, have you ever been in a situation like this? what helped you to let it go?",

            "body": "You need distance. He thinks he owns your experience and is manipulating it to still have control over your life. You've taken on a lot of guilt even though it sounds like you broke up for a very good reason to begin with. It sounds like you're still in the same friend group. I'm not suggesting you give up everything, but diversify. Meet new people. Get out of this group as you are able, because if they are hurting your feelings using his prompts they are not good people, they are not on your side. And the main reason I am suggesting distance is that you seem to regret not being able to get with this ex in the future. Look, he's not a nice man and if you did get back together he's still going to be the same guy. You are blessed to get away from him, you just do not know it yet. And I only know your side of the story, but distance is going to help no matter what. And obligatory consideration of therapy. It might be really good to find out why you are still letting this guy jerk you around so you can avoid that going forward.",
