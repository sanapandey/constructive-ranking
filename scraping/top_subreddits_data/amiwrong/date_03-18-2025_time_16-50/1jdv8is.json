    "selftext": "Within the last year I obtained full custody of my child after their mother\u2019s felony arrest for criminal mischief and driving while revoked for dui. In the body cam footage she was unhinged and drunk, arguing with police, etc. She can\u2019t keep a roof over her head. She admitted to periodic meth use to me. When the court ordered a drug test she never complied. It\u2019s likely she\u2019ll be going to jail for a period, possibly up to 6 months. \n\nWhere I live I\u2019m basically alone/have limited to no support because my whole family lives on the other side of the country. I have an opportunity to move closer to family and gain the village I\u2019ve never had but always wanted. However, I\u2019m worried I\u2019m not doing right by my kid by moving him away from his mother who presently has only supervised visitation. \n\nShe could relocate and has considered relocating in the past. I told her I was considering it now and she refused. I think my kid would have a better life, near family, living on the beach (not literally but within bicycle distance), and beautiful weather. I think my mental health would improve too which will translate to me being a better parent. \n\nI think it\u2019s the right move but, am I wrong?\n \nEdit: the judge has already given permission to leave the state.
