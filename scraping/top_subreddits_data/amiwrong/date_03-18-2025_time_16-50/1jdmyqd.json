    "selftext": "So my gf, some years ago, hooked up with this singer from a relatively famous band. I'm not naming it, but it's pretty popular, at least from what I know.  To be clear, this was before we got together.\n\nFrom what I know, they got my gf in the backstage, and to an after party... and she had sex with two of them. I'll be honest, after hearing this story, their music was ruined for me.\n\nNow, they are playing in a nearby city, and my gf said she wanted to see them. I told her that due to her past, this made me EXTREMELY uncomfortable. She said she wasn't gonna do anything and just wanted to enjoy the music and concert.\n\nI'm like one step away from breaking up with her. But I wanted some other opinions. My friends gave me conflicting advice.",

If you and your gf are in an otherwise healthy and loving relationship, I wouldn't ruin it over her past. It's not like she wants to hook up with them now. What would be sketchy is if she didn't tell you about hooking up with them, and then went to see them behind your back. That would be cause for concern. She's being upfront with you about everything. I don't think she should be punished for that. We all have a sexual history. It's just that she was with 2 people from a band. It's not like you hold that against her any other time, right? \nThat doesn't mean you shouldn't feel the way you do. Maybe there's some type of comprise you two can agree to. I personally feel like if my partner was this uncomfortable about something for a valid reason, I would choose my partner for sure.",

It's also about what the partner is deciding to do and how sketchy that looks. And in that case, yes, I understand why OP would feel uncomfortable with his partner purposefully going to see a band where she hooked up with them the last time she saw them. Just like you'd feel uncomfortable with your partner going to a hotel room with a member of the opposite sex. \n\nYou can say those have varying degrees of uncomfortabilty or how sketchy they look, and that's true.

That's why you can't say it's not about trust at all.

People only get betrayed by people they trust, who they thought were trustworthy. You've went backwards in your thinking again, probably because of your binary view on this matter. \"Either they are a cheater or they're not\", implying that people are always in complete control and are above the same mistakes that human beings have continually made since the dawn of time.\n\n>So to answer your stupid question; No, it wouldn't be an issue.\n\nOkay then. You know that the vast, vast majority of people would not be okay with their partner going to an ex's house to drink alone. I think you're advice to OP is pretty much useless then. It seems like your advice is to trust your partner up until the moment of physical contact, and only then it's okay to not trust them because they cheated.",

What's hard to understand about that? \n\n>perhaps doing things that put yourself in a very poor situation to do wrong should be avoided.\n\nJust because she has done something when she was single does not mean she would do it again while in a relationship.

They say they just have a lot of work, but they keep distancing themselves from you. You confront them, and they say, \"you should trust me. Just trust me. Why wouldn't you trust me?\" And this goes on for weeks, months. You find odd stuff, and you have a bad gut feeling, but they keep saying that you should just trust them.\n\nShould you? Or sometimes should you not accept just trusting them? Should you ever confront them and expect more of an explanation?",

I'm trying to get to the root of what trust and respect in a relationship could mean in situations such as OP's, and you're stuck on the surface level talking about the literal scenario of OP's gf going to a concert, and I don't even think we disagree with what OP should actually do.\n\n>What I said was either trust her and come up with a compromise that makes everyone happy, or leave.\n\nActually, you never said that. And no one would ultimately disagree with that. I don't.\n\n>so why would I have an answer to that question ready to go? \n\nUhhhhhh, I just meant for you to think of one, since your judging someone else's scenario, seems fair that you should be aware of your own.\n\n>Aside from the obvious; if he breaks my trust. \n\nOh. Okay. So in a discussion of trying to find the line where trust could end, you're unable to find your line. You said OP's girlfriend is doing nothing wrong, yet you're unable to think of an actual scenario where you think it would be valid to lose trust. We both know that sometimes people do cheat. So sometimes not trusting a partner would be justified, and in those cases, yes, they should come to a compromise or break up. \n\nHowever, sometimes, you trust your partner until they do something, as you said and acknowledge, \"that breaks your trust.\" OP could have trusted his partner, or still currently does, but the act of going to this concert could be the thing that breaks his trust, as trust is conditional. That doesn't mean that he didn't trust her before it, or even now. But if she crosses into unfamiliar territory that he doesn't feel comfortable with, she will lose his trust (and that's fine, it would just ultimately mean they're incompatible).\n\nWe all have that territory. Some people exploit it because they're extremely insecure or controlling. Some people are very trusting, or naive, or even very insecure (in the other direction, think 'doormat') and never really give it much thought or do anything about it. But we all have a threshold where we could go from trusting our partner, to not trusting them based on things they say or do. This could be OP's threshold. It clearly wouldn't be yours. That's okay. \n\nSo, saying that someone doesn't \"trust\" their partner because they don't want them to do whatever they want, seems silly. As an example, I could say I trust my partner, and part of that trust is that I trust them not to go to a concert to watch a band wherein they had sex with two of the members. If they did, I would lose some trust in them. If they didn't, then I would still trust them, cause I know that's not something they would ever do, and they would expect the same from me.\n\nSome people let their partners have sex with others, but fear their partner having emotional conversations with those people. That could be what breaks their trust. Everyone had different parameters. I don't know what does it for you, but the trust that you have for your BF is conditional (Hopefully you won't ever have to lose trust in them, as of course some people go through life never losing that trust with their partner, and I hope to do the same). So the whole point is, stop saying people don't trust their partners because they have a different threshold than you.",

Solid chance they were on something in the first place that would very likely alter their memory of the hook up, if they remember at all.  \n\nBut even if she were to be invited back stage, she can decline.  And even if she went back stage, she can choose not to have sex with anyone.  Growing up and not being single change a lot in the way someone behaves.",

What the fuck else have you been letting this woman get away with? That's so beyond the pale that it can't be the first second or third time she's tried to push her little boundaries and get away with it. If I were you I would have broken up for even asking let alone going through with it after being told you're not comfortable with it. It would have been a conversation whenever she told you about this apparent spit roasting. \"No I'm not comfortable with hearing about explicit shit you've done in the past with multiple men, please don't bring that up with me again. Respect my feelings.\" And that's that. \n\n\nExcuse me if I'm making assumptions but you have to start standing up for yourself in a big way in your relationships. Relationships are supposed to be 50/50 man. Not 60/40 or 70/30 in either persons favor. You, your feelings, and your needs have just as much value as the person next to you. What do you think she would do if the shoe were on the other foot? Would she not give a fuck or would she flip out? Which one is worse? Either way you have your answer. Dump this woman and then explain to all your mutuals exactly why before they start bitching at you and making you second guess yourself for doing something 100% valid. For real. I hope you get through this unscathed and find someone who values you.",

Sexual fantasies and past memories, combined with present-day feelings... She's likely infatuated because of her experience.\n\nI mean, I would be, if I were in her shoes. But I'd also want to respect my partner, first-and-foremost. Which... I hope she does, for your sake.\n\nIs it worth breaking up for? That depends on how much you actually trust her. My ex had sex with lots of people we knew in common, and I trusted her to the ends of the earth - because that's what kind of person she was. She just liked to have fun, and was very sexual. She also told me about all of her encounters, which was a good thing for our communication and expectations.\n\nSo, I can't blame her - but she was also a mature and level-headed individual who respected me and never once broke that trust. While we were together, we never once fucked around on each other. We even discussed personal fantasies.\n\n**Your** actual mileage may vary because I'm not in your shoes, nor do I know your partner. So you'll obviously have to go with your gut, based on how well you know and trust her. Nobody else can decide for you... It starts with a conversation.",

Or are you going to trust that she's committed to you and not going to cheat on you at all? \n\nYou do realize that musicians often hook up with random strangers, right? Does your distaste for any particular band's music extend past the ones who specifically hooked up with the woman you are now dating because it's the same concept and principle? Or is it that you only dislike people who have hooked up with your girlfriend? The answers to these questions determine if you're really just being insecure and need to take a deeper look inward and consider why this is and why you'd end a relationship over something like this.",

Being a \"man whore\" or a \"womanizer\" comes with a negative connotation and in most cases is seen as a huge red flag. \n\nAnd the only reason a high body is even celebrated among some men is because, just like women are judged by beauty and purity, one of the factors men are judged by in society by both men and women is sexual prowess. If I as a man am not good in bed or can't satisfy a women then I am somehow seen as less of a man. And for the vast majority that aren't born naturally gifted the only way to get good at it is practice. So if you get with a lot of women you are seen as being \"good in bed\" and therefore your status on the social ladder goes up. \n\nPlus I don't even really hear most men caring about body count unless we're talking high numbers tbh. I'm talking like high double digits to triple digits which I think most women would be thrown off with as well.",
