    "selftext": "Seven months ago, I(20m) told my friend(19f) I have feelings for her. She said that if I lose some weight maybe she\u2019ll say yes. Then she clarified that she was only joking and only see me as a brother. We carried on mostly as usual.\n\nThree months ago, my uncle had a stroke. I was a couch potato before this. Literally sat most of the time I\u2019m home, watching TV and eating snacks. Seeing him in the hospital made me freak out. I got afraid that I\u2019d end up like that at the age of 45 like him.\n\nI started running four days a week and eating very light dinners. Ended up losing seven kilos. \n\nMy friend noticed the difference and told me she wasn\u2019t serious about the losing weight comment, and that I\u2019m taking it too far. That I\u2019m going to get underweight soon.\n\nI told her it\u2019s nothing to do with her and even explained about my uncle. She just said that he\u2019s a \u2018chain smoking, alcoholic idiot\u2019 before telling me there\u2019s no reason for me to push myself this hard. Still believed I was doing it because of her so I told her the earth doesn\u2019t revolve around her. She got quite upset. Should I apologize?",

Tell her she owes you no explanation for not wanting to date you.  Doesn't matter if you're too fat or too skinny or she doesn't like your haircut, who you date is a personal choice and nobody gets to question it.  She said no and that's the end of it.  You won't ask her again even if someday you look like a fitness model and you're okay with that.  \n\nThe fact is you've had a difficult family situation.  Your uncle may be a chain smoking alcoholic idiot, but he's your uncle and you love him dearly.  And the fact that she'd just dismiss a man you care about speaks volumes about what kind of person she is on the inside.  It's not good and you hope she thinks long and hard about it.  \n\nAs it stands, you did actually change your life because of him.  Seeing him in the hospital made you realize that with your lifestyle, that was gonna be you someday, and you don't want that.  So you made a change- not for her, not for him, but for you.  \n\nIt's sad that she can't see beyond her own dating world to realize that other people are important to other people.  You hope someday she opens her eyes and realizes that.  But for now you're not sure you want to continue your friendship with her, because her making your uncle's death and your reaction somehow about her was very hurtful.",
