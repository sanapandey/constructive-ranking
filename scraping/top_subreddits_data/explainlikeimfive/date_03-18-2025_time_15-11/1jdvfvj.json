    "selftext": "Why isn't there a way to measure levels of neurotransmittere in the brain?\n\nLet me explain what I mean.\n\nFor many mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety, the cause is assumed to be abnormal levels of neurotransmitteres (e.g. Dopamine and Serotonin) in the brain. It would logically follow then, that the way to diagnose such illnesses is to measure the level of these neurotransmitters in the brain and compare them to normal levels, basically like any other disease is diagnosed.\n\nHowever, this is not the case for mental illnesses. They are diagnosed via the often unreliable method of assessing symptoms and eliminating other causes. Why is that the case? Are there no ways to measure neurotransmitter levels in the brain or do we not have enough information on the \"normal\" amounts of these hormones?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for all the responses! This has been very educational. I'm going to research mental illnesses more since their causes and pathophysiology seem to be a very interesting topic that's yet to be fully uncovered. ",

Antipsychotics are among the drugs I will concede can cause brain damage; haliperidol is specifically neurotoxic as it forms a reactive pyridinium metabolite that selectively destroys dopaminergic neurons. However, with most antipsychotics these structural changes are not necessarily irreversible, and in fact there is evidence that atypical antipsychotics exert a neuroprotective effect ([source 1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30982644/), [source 2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38927091/)). You also have to put these findings in a broader context. Antipsychotics are necessary for people with schizophrenia to achieve a functional quality of life and, as horrible as they are, side effects like cognitive impairment or metabolic syndrome do not outweigh the benefits provided by these essential medications.",

The \"monoamine hypothesis\", that is, the idea that people with depression have low levels of serotonin or dopamine in their brains, has largely been rejected by researchers.  Researchers still aren't sure what causes depression, but other hypotheses, such as that depression is caused by reduced neuroplasticity, that it's caused by hypo or hyperactivity in certain areas of the brain, or that it's caused by inflammation, are being researched.  \n\nMore to the point, though, we diagnose and treat mental illnesses by symptoms, since that's what's affecting the patient's life.  If a person's depression gets better while taking SSRIs, it doesn't really matter why they needed SSRIs in the first place, and so it's not worth trying to assess whether it's caused by a deficiency in monoamines or inflammation or something else.",

            "body": "Imagine your brain is like a giant, super-complicated city with thousands of roads and highways. Neurotransmitters (like serotonin and dopamine) are like cars driving around, delivering messages.\n\nNow, let\u2019s say people in the city are acting strange, some are super sad, some are anxious, some can\u2019t focus. You might think, \u201cMaybe there are too many or too few cars on the road!\u201d But the problem isn\u2019t just how many cars there are -it\u2019s where they\u2019re going, how fast, and whether they\u2019re actually getting to where they need to be.\n\nThe issue is, we don\u2019t have a way to park a helicopter over this city and count every single car on every road. Neurotransmitters move super fast, and their levels change all the time depending on what you're doing, thinking, or feeling. The brain also has tons of hidden side streets and detours that we don\u2019t fully understand yet.\n\nThat\u2019s why doctors don\u2019t diagnose mental illness by measuring neurotransmitters directly. Instead, they look at the bigger picture -your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors- because those tell us more about how the brain is working than just counting the \"cars\" on the road.",

(These are the non-invasive \u201cmeasurements\u201d we can make about a person; their general health, their professional and academic performance, and so on.)\n\nSimilarly, we can only pull on some very broad levers to try to make changes. We can build a wind farm to power the city\u2019s grid, and we\u2019ve seen that this has helped other cities cut emissions. We *think* this is because wind power displaces fossil fuel plants, which are dirtier. But it doesn\u2019t help *every* city cut emissions, and sometimes it increases crime or reduces GDP. Maybe a city already has enough renewable power, or maybe it doesn\u2019t get enough wind. (This is the equivalent of getting more sleep or taking medication; very broad changes with manifold effects.)\n\nThen make it even worse. We can put a number to a city\u2019s GDP.

There's also not a clear correlation between changes to neurotransmitter levels in parts of the brain and mental health conditions, considering how heterogeneous these illnesses are. While there's some truth to alterations in monoamines in the brain being associated with mental health disorders, you would need to determine how accurately measuring these changes would rule in-or-out a condition. For example, assuming you could reliably measure neurotransmitter levels in specific brain regions through non-invasive techniques, and assuming this could diagnose people, there's still a likelihood that it could incorrectly rule-out people who actually *do* have the condition. You also have to consider that our current strategies for diagnosing mental health conditions, based on evaluations by trained health professionals, helps us to contextualise a patient's progress (or lack thereof) following the diagnosis.",
