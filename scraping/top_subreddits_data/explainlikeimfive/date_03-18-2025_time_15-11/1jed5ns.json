    "selftext": "Generally when tackling the topics of capacitors and inductors, schools try to use weird stories to try to make us remember their behaviors, such as capacitors favour constant voltage and inductors favour constant current. \n\nFor me the behavior of a capacitor is very intuitive. You apply a potential across the plates of a capacitor and it charges up to their difference. Current does'nt flow because there is no potential diff b/w the source and the cap (acts like a open circuit) and when the cap is short circuited, it sparks (pretty obvious why).\n\nI just can't get the intutions for the behavior of the inductor down. They seem way too outlandinsh in their working. Would really appreciate a dumbed down explanation of this that electrically makes sense.",

            "body": "With current flow, you'll also get a magnetic field. You can also set it up so the opposite is true: a mag field creating current. One way to make that current is to change the strength of the mag field. So if current decreases through the inductor, that current change will also change the mag field present, which in turn creates additional current to try and keep up.\n\nThink of capacitors as things things that store voltage using an electric field, and inductors as things that store current using a mag field. It's that changing mag field that will make current.",

If the voltage across the capacitor is changing, then current is flowing through it. The current that flows through a capacitor is proportional to the rate of change of the voltage, and the constant of proportionality is the capacitance. If the capacitance is larger, it takes more current to charge/discharge it. When people say that capacitors \"favour constant voltage\" what they mean is that the voltage on a capacitor cannot change instantaneously - to make the voltage change more quickly you need more current to flow through the capacitor.\n\nInductors are the opposite. The voltage on an inductor is proportional to the rate of change of the current. The current through an inductor cannot change instantly, and the faster the rate of change of current the greater the voltage must be across the inductor. If you force the current to change very rapidly - e.g by opening a switch, then a very large voltage will be created as a result. This is the principle of operation of a car ignition coil, for example, which uses a large inductor and a switch to create a pulse of very high voltage to operate the spark plugs in a combustion engine. \n\nCapacitors store energy in the electric field, inductors store energy in the magnetic field. The energy stored in a capacitor is proportional to the square of the voltage while the energy stored in an inductor is proportional to the square of the current.\n\nAs far as analogies go, I think of inductance like inertia and a capacitor like a spring. The equations are the same and if you like analogies, you can take this one [quite far](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrkiJZKJfpY), and build mechanical analogs of many common circuits. But I don't find that too helpful, what I find more useful is visualizing the behaviour of circuits with a simulator like [this one](https://falstad.com/circuit/).",

            "body": "Have you ever seen videos about \"water hammer\"?  If you open a valve in a water pipe, then slam it shut, the water has some momentum that turns into pressure.  the water pressure spikes and drives a pressure wave back wards through the pipe.  That's analogous to inductance. \n\nIf you increase the momentum of the water flow, say, by replacing it with mercury, the pressure spike is much larger.  Changing the mass of the liquid is reasonably analogous to adding an inductor.\n\nIt's analogous because it's the FLOW of liquid that has momentum, and  changing that momentum requires or releases energy. Likewise, it's the CURRENT of electrical circuits that has an associated magnetic field, and changing that magnetic field requires or releases energy",

            "body": ">I just can't get the intutions for the behavior of the inductor down.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAs you know, an electric current flowing through a wire generates a magnetic field surrounding the wire, whose strength (magnetic flux) is determined by the current (amperage) as well as the physical shape of the conductor and a bunch of other things. The ratio of the two gives us the *inductance.*\n\nAn inductor is created by shaping a wire into a coil or helix, often around a piece of ferromagnetic metal to boost the magnetic field (and therefore the inductance).\n\nSo, we've got an electric current generating a magnetic field around the wire. Now, what happens if you strengthen the current?\n\nWell, the magnetic field strengthens as well. But where does the energy come from to do that? It's gotta come from *somewhere* -- you don't get something for nothing.\n\nThe energy comes from the electric current -- the rise in potential energy in the magnetic field comes at the cost of the *electrical* potential energy. And the term we use to describe electrical potential is -- voltage! Therefore, when the current across an inductor increases, the voltage drops until the current stabilizes. The reverse happens if current falls -- magnetic potential energy exits the field and manifests as a rise in voltage.",
