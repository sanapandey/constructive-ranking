            "body": "This is mostly from the perspective of UK-EU flights. I haven't flown to the US in a long time, and I don't know much about other parts of the world.\n\nPart 1: check-in \nFirst, you \"check in\". This can usually be done online, or in person. If you do it online, you may have to print a ticket at home, use a ticket that's on your phone, or print the ticket from a machine at the airport. If you go in person, you'll need to find your flight on an information screen and find the right desk to check in for your flight. \n\nAt this stage they will ask you some important-sounding questions to make sure you don't have any forbidden items in your luggage, and that you packed it yourself. Look up the rules for your airline when you are packing, and always say yes you packed it yourself.\n\nIf you have a large suitcase, you will need to hand over the bag at this stage. If checking-in in person, it's just part of the process. If you have checked in online, there is sometimes a \"bag drop\" service near the check-in desks, or you can just check in again.\n\nPart 2: security\nOnce that's over, you can go through security, where they will check all the items that you can take on the plane. Basically, don't try to take anything sharp on, and usually there are restrictions on liquids, so either pack these in your checked-in case, or take small bottles. You may need to put these liquids in a clear plastic bag.\n\nLook up the specific rules for your airport before you go, because they do vary by country and by equipment. In an older system you have to separate a lot of items - remove laptops from bags, liquid bags from main bags, etc....you place these things, and your coat and pocket contents, in a plastic basket which then goes through an x-ray machine. You'll then be asked to step through a metal detector arch.\n\nNewer systems don't usually require you to unpack your bag, and you'll be asked to pose while facing a special wall. These are increasingly common in Europe.\n\nWith any luck you will just need to collect your things and move on, but they may search your bag, or your body. It's nerve-wracking but just keep calm and remember they are just doing their job. Answer their questions and it should all be fine.\n\nPart 3 Passport Control\nA lot of the time, you won't have passport control when departing, you'll only have it on arrival. However, sometimes you will, particularly in Europe where they check everyone *out* of the Schengen area, and all flights to non Schengen countries will be in an international terminal of the airport. So I will mention it now.\n\nQueue up in the correct line - usually there's at least one for more local passports, and a different line for everyone else. Just wait your turn, and then show your passport and any other relevant visa documents. They may ask you questions like where you are staying, what you are doing on your trip, etc. so just answer honestly.\n\nPart 4: waiting\nOnce through security, you are just waiting to be called. There will be shops and restaurants. Keep an eye on information screens. About 30 mins before the flight you will be told a gate to go to. It's usually sensible to move there as soon as it comes up. There won't be more than a cafe and some toilets at the gate, so make sure you have what you need before you go to the gate.\n\nThen you have to wait again at the gate. Staff will eventually call you to board. This is usually done in groups, like first class first. They will check your boarding pass and ID (usually passport if flying internationally) before you board.\n\nPart 5: boarding\nSometimes you will just walk over a bridge to the plane. Sometimes you will walk across the tarmac and climb stairs into the plane. Sometimes you will board a bus that takes you to the plane, and then you climb stairs.\n\nOnce you are on the plane, find your row and seat. Place your larger bags in the shelf bins above the seats - don't worry if you need to use one that isn't over your seat, it's a first-come-first-serve free-for-all. You can place smaller bags under your seat. Read the safety card, adjust your seatbelt, and get comfortable.\n\nEventually they will move off and give a safety presentation. Then the flight will take off!\n\nPart 6: in-flight\nJust relax and follow the staff instructions. There's a light indicating if you are allowed to leave your seat, and really you only want to do this if you need to go to the bathroom. Otherwise, stay in your seat.\n\nThey may hand out food, particularly on longer flights. Look up what you get included, and what costs extra. \n\nPart 7: arrival\nEventually you will land. Don't try to unclip and get up until the seatbelt light turns off. It's usually a little fraught getting off - just let people in a rush get off and you can get off in your own time.\n\nFollow signs and the flow of people. If you have gone to a different country, usually passport control will be the next stage - see part 3. Then you will be directed to an area to collect suitcases. If you had checked bags, then you'll need to look at an information screen to find your flight, and then go to the correct carousel. Eventually, your bag will appear.\n\nFinally, you'll pass customs. There's usually a green arch that says \"nothing to declare\". If you have checked the rules on what you can bring into the country, you can walk through this. You might be stopped and asked some questions, and they may search your bags, but it's never happened to me.\n\nYou are now out and free!",

In Europe you get your setting place already when booking it.\n\nOverbooked seats are sold without a specific seat assignment, and it happens all over the globe.\n\nIf there are explicit cancellations and re-bookings they are available seats that get assigned at that point.  Before boarding they may have a connecting flight that was delayed, and that's a source of available seats that also get assigned when the connecting flight delay is announced.\n\nNext, when they start boarding (typically 30-45 minutes before departure) people who haven't checked in are the next group bumped, that's why checking in as early as possible is important. If you can do it online the day before, it tells the airline you'll be there. Often they'll call people up at the gate and assign the seats.  If someone arrives late to the airport and hasn't checked in they'll be put at the top of that unassigned seat queue, still able to claim a seat if they manage to get there quickly enough.\n\nFinally, if there are still people in the queue when all the other passengers are on and they're doing the final call for boarding, if any boarding pass hasn't been scanned yet they'll fill those seats. It doesn't happen often, but people in the airport get distracted, stuck in the toilets, have medical issues, or whatever, and end up missing their flights getting filled by someone else because they missed the final boarding call.",

The line for the agent was insanely long (the airport had a bunch of cancellations that day) and didn't make it to the front until the plane was already gone.  The agent informed me that the plane had been full anyway, and that I need to check in sooner next time.  Basically, as soon as the hour-before-departure hits, if they have a backlog of passengers (or deliberate overbooking) they start filling the empty seats.  That was ... almost 15 years ago!\n\nEven checking in many hours in advance, it might give a message \"see gate attendant for seat assignment\".  That's code for \"we overbooked\".  Then at the gate they announce that they'll give rebates to anyone who is willing to take a later flight.  They do kind of an auction where they keep upping the incentive until someone takes it, and then they finish seat-assignment, then board a 100% full flight.",

Find your gate\n    - I like to find my flight's departure Gate first thing so that I know where I need to be when it's time to leave\n    - this should be listed on your boarding pass but if not look around for departure boards. These list all the upcoming flights departing \n5. Go grab a snack, fill your water bottle, use the washroom, hangout, relax\n6. Be at the gate for boarding\n    - this will depend on the size of the flight but I'd be ready at the gate ~30-45 mins before the departure time\n\nAirports generally have tonnes of signage so you shouldn't get lost but if in doubt just ask someone official looking if can help with directions",

This is especially important if you don't fly often and will most likely be the last to board. Flight attendants are there for your safety first, and only get paid when the doors close, so they are interested in getting going.

Those are the only 2 things they will need.           \nIf you are wearing a mask (airports and planes are germ fests), you will need to drop the mask for a sec for the TSA agent.\n\n4 - Toiletries - most liquids are still limited to 3oz.  If you need anything specific in terms of shampoo/conditioner/soap/etc vs what will be provided at your destination (friend/relative/hotel), see if your local Walmart/Target/etc has a Travel size.  I refill my travel size shampoo from a large bottle before each trip, the 3oz is good for about a week.\n\n4 - Pro Tip - if you have a jacket with zipped pockets, I wear this through the TSA line, and stash everything from my pants pockets into the jacket while waiting in line at TSA.  Add your Ticket and ID once you hit the TSA agent, then zip those pockets closed, and you can take off the entire jacket, drop it onto one of the buckets they use for scanning your luggage, and when you pick it up on the far side you just slip it on, grab your shoes and bags and go.          \nIt just makes it easier than dealing with putting 9 things in the scanner bucket and then having to find a place for all 9 things again in your pockets on the far side.\n\n3 and 5 - Google your Flight Number  DL1234 or similar for Delta.                \nThis will often tell you the terminal and closer to departure the gate.          \nHowever it's best to check the big TV screens past security to confirm the gate number.\n\n8 - Got Girl Scout Cookies for sale in your area?  Bring a box of thin mints for the flight crew.  Hand them to the Flight Attendant who will be about 3 feet inside the plane when you first step on.  Tell them you appreciate what they do and brought them a little snack.             \nThey might ask what your seat is, so have that in mind.        \nI've gotten everything from a quick thank you once, to the entire FA crew and even one of the pilots thanking me for the thoughtful gift, and one of the first times I did it they came by with free drinks for me.        \nNot mandatory, but certainly has gone a long way for me (I travel domestic at least 2-3 times a year for the past 15 years).",

Arrive even earlier if it's a holiday. \n\n1.  When checking bags, most airlines have kiosks. Use the QR code, reservation number, or credit card to pull up your reservation.  Attach the tag to your luggage then take them to the counter. Have your ID ready to show the employee.  Keep the claim ticket for your luggage in case your bag gets lost. \n\n2.  When going through security, have your ID once again.   You'll need to remove your shoes and put them in the bin. Remove everything in your pockets. \n\n3. After going through security, there will be a back of monitors with gate assignments. Find your destination, confirm the gate number on your boarding pass, and go there. \n\n6.  If you are flying Southwest, you will not have an assignment. Rather, have a boarding group/number on your boarding pass that dictates the order in which you board the plane. There are physical columns or similar that are numbered to indicate where to line up when verbally when instructed. \n\n7. If you have a carryon, put it in the bin above or your seat (or above a row BEFORE yours) for easy access. Otherwise you will be fighting the outflow of passengers when getting off the plane. If it's a small carryon or personal item, stick it under the seat in front of you. \n\n8. If you have to use the restroom while on the plane, do it at least 20 minutes before you land. After that point, they require everyone to remain seated until landed.  \n\n9.  Once you land, follow the signs to Baggage Claim. There will likely be a bank of monitors around there indicating which carousel to retrieve your bags. Each carousel will have a monitor indicating which flight the bags are coming from.  If you are missing a bag, there are offices for each airline in that area. Go in and present your bag tag for assistance.",

When it\u2019s your group\u2019s turn, go in the green lane (it\u2019s labelled #2) and get in line.  The agent will scan your boarding pass and you walk on the plane.  \n\nIf you don\u2019t know what seat is yours, ask the flight attendant.  They\u2019ll point you in the right direction. Also every seat is labeled on the edge of the overhead bins.  You\u2019ll see it.  It\u2019s pretty easy.  \n\nMy daughter flew solo at 14.

You\u2019ll also want to identify any requirements for entering your destination (visas or anything similar) and handle those.\n\n2. Book a flight through your website/agency of choice. Look at the departure/landing times/dates and keep in mind they may be in a different time zone from your current one. You\u2019ll also want to identify how much luggage you\u2019re cleared to bring for free and how much you\u2019ll have to pay for when booking your flight. Make sure you pay attention to what you can put in your luggage and what you can\u2019t put in.\n\n3. You may also want to arrange for other necessities such as transportation and cellphone service at your new location. You can usually get them at the airport but you may need to make reservations.\n\n4. About a day prior to your departure, you can generally check in online through a link provided to you and get your boarding pass emailed to you. On the day of departure, make sure you have your passport. I recommend arriving to the airport 3 hours prior to your departure time to give yourself some time to account for check in, security and finding your gate. Make sure you are at the right terminal because some airlines have multiple terminals for domestic or international flights.\n\n5. When you arrive to the airport, the first thing you\u2019ll do is check in. This is where you line up at your choice of airline\u2019s desk and check in your luggage and can get physical boarding passes. Your boarding passes are the actual tickets which will get you on the flight.  \u201cChecking your luggage\u201d means the airline will transport your luggage in the bottom cargo of the aircraft. \u201cCarry on luggage\u201d is luggage you bring with you to place in the overhead compartments/under the seat in the flight. Large suitcases and bags are checked in. Backpacks and small suitcases are often carried on. When you are checking in luggage, they will weigh your luggage and put tags on them before putting them on a conveyor belt. Keep any tags/tickets they give you. Checking in is one of the two things that can take a lot of time.\n\n6. After checking in, you have to head to the security checkpoint. This is the other part where it can take a bit of time. Get in line and do what everyone else is doing or what the signs/guards are telling you to do. Typically, you\u2019ll take off your shoes, remove your jacket, remove all items from your pockets and put them into trays. If you have any carry on luggage, you\u2019ll also put them into a tray. Sometimes you will need to remove any laptops/tablets from your carry on luggage and place them into the trays as well. You\u2019ll then walk through a metal detector body scanner thing.\n\n7. After you get through the body scanner, you will have to grab your items from the trays. Sometimes they will do a more thorough inspection of your carry on luggage and request you to open the luggage. Simply show them what is in your luggage and then when you are cleared, you can take your stuff back and put on your shoes/jacket. \n\n8. Find your gate. It should be on your ticket. You can also cross reference your gate on the ticket with one of the many departure screens at the airport which displays flight info to see if anything has changed. For example if your ticket says Flight UA882, look at the screen for UA882 to see if it matches your ticket. The screen will also usually show the most up to date info on your flight so you can see if it\u2019s been delayed or the gate has changed. You should check these screens periodically so you know if anything has changed.\n\n9. Flights will usually begin boarding about 30-45 minutes prior to the departure time. Flights will also close their doors much earlier than their stated departure times. Once their door is closed and you are not on the flight, they will not open for boarding again which means you missed your flight. The departure times are when the flight is expected to depart which means the few minutes prior to it where the doors are closed will be for pre-flight checks and taxiing. Flights usually break boarding up in sections or groups. When they call your group, you can line up for boarding. Your ticket will have the boarding group you\u2019re in. You will need to scan your boarding pass prior to boarding. Your ticket will have your alphanumeric seat number such as 33B. The number represents the row and the letter represents the seat in that row. Find your seat and put any carry on luggage you have into the overhead compartments above it. Sit down, buckle in your seat belt and put your phone on airplane mode. After boarding is complete, the flight attendants will do a pre-flight safety brief. The flight will take off shortly afterwards.\n\n10. After your flight lands and begins taxiing on the runway, you can switch your phone off airplane mode. Wait for the seatbelt sign to turn off before grabbing your carry on luggage from the overhead compartments. After you get off, make your way to baggage claim by following the posted signs. Find the carousel marked with your flight number and wait for your luggage to show up. Grab your luggage and follow signs for exit. You may need to show receipts for your luggage as proof it\u2019s yours. Once you exit the baggage claim area, you can now go get the necessities you may need such as portable Wifi box, eSim card, car rental, etc. Otherwise you can get transportation out of the airport any which way you need.",

            "body": "Hokay, so. Here's the deal (from someone who has been flying since infancy, and has worked in airports for five years):\n\n1. About 24 hours before your flight, you will get an email and/or a text from the airline reminding you to check in for your flight online. If you have the app for your airline, you can use that (I see you are flying United, so their app is pretty user friendly), or you can use a regular browser. If you are checking in on the browser, you will probably need your confirmation number, which should be in the email you got confirming your booking. If you checked in on the app, it will give you a digital boarding pass. If you checked in on the browser, it will enable you to print a boarding pass at home.\n2. Make sure you are packed correctly - there are things that can't go in carry-on bags and have to be sent in checked luggage. Check [TSA's guide](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/all) for some commonly asked about items. Of particular note, any liquid or gel or paste or spray more than 3.4 oz is not allowed in your carry-on, so if you have a water bottle, it needs to be empty before you go through security \n3. Once you get to the airport, if you are checking a bag, didn't check in online, or need to get a boarding pass printed, look for the ticket counters, which are usually right in the entrance area. If you don't need to do any of those things, you can head straight to the security checkpoint. Depending on the setup, you may need your boarding pass, but you will definitely need your ID ready.\n4. At the checkpoint, you will need to remove your shoes, jacket, and anything in your pockets other than air and dryer lint. It's also recommended to take your belt off unless it will cause you to lose your pants. You may need to take stuff out of your bag to be x-rayed separately, but that depends on the airport and what equipment they are using. Pay attention to the instructions the security officers are giving and you should be all set for that airport's setup.\n5. You will go through a body scanner, and any areas that the scanner flags, an officer of the same gender will pat down. At the same time, your stuff is going through the x-ray. If there is anything that is possibly an issue, the bag will get pulled aside to be searched (you'll see it on the other side of the x-ray rollers from the rest of the bags). If that is necessary, the search will be done with you present, generally in the order the bags were pulled.\n6. Once you've collected your belongings, there should be screens nearby with gate assignments. Find your flight on there and make sure you are going to the right gate. Depending on the airport, you might need to take a tram or a shuttle to the gate area.\n7. Once you have located the gate area, you are free to relax until you are called for boarding (this usually starts about 39 minutes before the scheduled flight time). Your boarding pass will list a boarding group - the gate agent will call the groups one or two at a time, and when you hear yours, line up to board. They will scan your boarding pass to make sure you are getting on the right plane, and may ask you to gate check your bag (particularly if you are in a later boarding group, space for carry-ons might get full). This can take one of two forms. They may put a (usually colored) tag on it and have it brought up to the jet bridge when you land, or they may print a normal baggage tag out and send it like a normal checked bag, in which case you will get it from the baggage claim carousel at your destination. Important note: If you have a connection (you are changing flights before getting to your final destination), the first type of gate check sees you picking up the bag as you get off the plane in that intermediate airport, while the second will reunite you with it at the final stop.\n8. Once you board the plane, find your seat put your carry-on bags either in the overhead bin or under the seat in front of you, and buckle your seatbelt.\n9. Have a safe flight.",

            "body": "Different airlines fly out of different terminals. Make sure you find the right terminal.\n\nShow up two hours early.\n\nYou can check in online 24 hours ahead of departure, or there in-person at a kiosk.  I like to write the flight confirmation no. on a sheet of paper in case I need to refer to it, or if the kiosk doesn't like scanning your documents. You will get a boarding pass. If you are checking luggage, you will be directed to the luggage desk. Check for your gate number on the pass and screen. It might not yet be available, but check the TV screens on the walls frequently in case of delay. The screen is more correct than the pass.\n\nLiquids go in your checked luggage, not your carry-on. No knives beyond cartridge disposable razors allowed through security. No drinks/water. Refill a bottle post security. Airport snacks are very, very expensive. If you want to, get a dry snack the day before your flight and pack it. Firearms must be in checked luggage in an approved case. Flammables are not cool either. List of approved or not approved items here: [https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/all?page=30](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/all?page=30)\n\nCarry as few items in your pocket as possible. put them all in your carry on and/or backpack ahead of security. Airports do not like tablets/laptops in your carryon/backpack. They will ask you to put that in a bin/tray separately. Make sure the laptop or tablet is easily accessible so you can remove it. TSA will ask to see your photo ID and boarding pass, so those are the two items you should have ready.\n\nThere is likely going to be a camera that will take a picture of your face and compare it to your ID, or you can kindly request \"no photo please\" before you hand over your ID, and they will visually verify you match your ID.\n\nYou then go through security and remove your shoes, belt, and jacket and place them in a bin alongside your carry on or backpack/personal item. Those will be X-rayed. They will have you stand in a body scanner.\n\nThe airplane might be a little chilly. I advise wearing a second layer like a light jacket. Good wired earbuds for in-flight movies on the seat screens. Keep a cell phone charger or power bank handy somewhere so you can charge on the plane or in the airport.\n\nMake your way to the gate. Boarding ends a handful of minutes before the departure time. Check your boarding pass regarding when boarding actually ends. Not departure time.\n\nGet a drink or snack as you wait. Eventually, you will board in different boarding groups. Your pass will indicate which group. You will present your boarding pass to the gate agent, and will make your way to your assigned seat that should be on your pass. Carry-ons go in the overhead compartments above or near your seat. Personal items/backpacks can go under the seat in front of you.\n\nListen to flight attendant instructions regarding flight procedures. You will be fine.\n\nWhen you land, do not immediately stand up and make your way to the front. Wait until most of the people in front of you have/are offboarded.\n\nMake your way to baggage claim, posted on the airport signs. Baggage usually gets there within 15 mins of landing. Might be delayed. Check the baggage claim screens to see which carousel is the one for your flight and claim it from the carousel.\n\nThen you can either make your way to the car rental counters, public transportation/uber pick up spots/taxis, or passenger pick ups. If you are being picked up, the various columns outside should have numbers on them to help whoever is picking you up locate you.",
