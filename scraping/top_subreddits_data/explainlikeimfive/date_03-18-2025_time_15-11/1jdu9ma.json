            "body": "Those critters aren\u2019t necessarily trying to fly towards the light. They use a light source as a way to navigate. Before man-made lights, moths would use moonlight or starlight, which didn\u2019t \u201cmove\u201d in the eyes of the moth as it\u2019s flying with how far away it is. However, a streetlight quickly moves in the moth\u2019s field of view given how close it is, and the moth keeps \u201cadjusting\u201d its flight path thinking it stationary, resulting it ultimately flying circles around the light source.",

While that is substantial I'd presume the selective pressure of car fatalities is actually relatively low and in direct contention with other beneficial traits. From research this includes: effectively reflective eye layers that enhance night vision but certainly contribute to the \"deer in headlights\" saying because they are therefore overwhelmed by bright light and unable to detect a fast approaching threat AND a natural freeze response to avoid predator's detection that obviously doesn't translate to cars.\n\nBut then again the animal eye itself did evolve. Given enough time and luck and consistent environmental selection, I wouldn't be surprised if deers gained some instinct to avoid gasoline smell or even something significantly less believable like thermal vision or biological emps. But cars are evolving much faster than deers so idk if they'll keep up with a genetic adaptation or just stay lucky enough as a species to not all get splattered. (I think cars will be much more able to avoid deers near perfectly before there is even a .01% improvement in the genetic car avoidance traits of deers)",

New paragraph this is kind of why they don't smack into the light head first but tend to smack their back into the light etc. \n\nIt's actually kind of pathetic and cruel.\n\nBasically they lack an inner ear to help them find balance so they're using light instead and we are basically constantly pushing them over to various sides. \n\nThis is why they don't fly straight into the lights but they end up sort of orbiting and circling and banging and smacking around them in what otherwise appear to be drunk and spirals. \n\nThey're just trying to fly straight on with their business and our light bulbs prevent that.",

You see a bright light, like a lamp or a candle, and it looks so pretty that you want to fly toward it. Moths and other bugs do this because their brains are wired to use light to figure out where they\u2019re going. A long time ago, before people made lamps, the brightest thing at night was usually the moon. Moths used the moon like a big compass to fly straight.\n\nNow, the sun is super bright, right? But here\u2019s the thing: the sun is only out during the day, and moths mostly fly at night. So, they don\u2019t even see the sun when they\u2019re zooming around. During the day, they\u2019re usually hiding or resting, not flying. Plus, the sun is *so* far away\u2014like, way farther than the moon\u2014that it doesn\u2019t trick their little brains the same way a nearby light does. It\u2019s too big and too high up to feel like something they need to chase.\n\nSo, moths don\u2019t fly into the sun because they\u2019re night-time explorers, and the sun\u2019s just not part of their adventure!",
