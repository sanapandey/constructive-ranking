They\u2019re very different animals with different evolutionary processes.",

Male and female eagles look almost identical since they both do eagle things. They both roost, they both search for food, etc.\n\nChickens on the other hand, have distinct gender roles, where one will be in charge or rearing young, while the other defends the flock while competing with others.",

Corvids are sexually monomorphic, meaning there are no distinct visual differences between males and females. (Males are often larger, however.)\n\nIn sexually dimorphic birds (where males and females look different), most often it is the case that males have more colorful plumage, usually for attracting mates, and the females have more \"plain\" or earth tone colored plumage to enable them to hide themselves and their young from predators.",

It's almost always the male that initiates and the female picks--kind of like humans!\n\nFor blue jays and Steller's jays, the males bow to the females and give her gifts of food and nesting materials. If she likes it, they're mates for life.",

They don\u2019t have the concept of gender identity, so it\u2019s okay to refer to their biological sex as, well, \u201csex\u201d. Which is different than \u201cgender\u201d.",

Then again they are very intelligent birds and I'll speculate that they don't need it to be able to tell or communicate male and female apart.",

            "body": "Typically, obvious gender differences like colorful and large plumage is designed to show off and attract a mate. This is similar to antlers on elk or horns on sheep used to fight over mates. \n\n  \nThis is a bit of a strange adaptation when you think about it - on one hand it doesn\u2019t seem like it benefits the individual or the species on the whole to put so much energy into these showy body parts, let alone \\*fighting\\* and potentially getting hurt, when that energy could be used for each individual to just be healthier or stronger or take care of their young better.\n\nOn the other hand it does sometimes result in the strongest/healthiest genes being passed down, and it certainly results in the flashiest, most aggressive or most \u201cattractive\u201d genes getting passed down. So if flashy mating displays are a common trait in a species, every member of the species basically needs to compete in that way or risk dying out.\n\nBasically these traits do not actually help a species on the whole in all cases, but the traits tend to get passed on anyways. So it\u2019s not clear if you expect a really colorful or different-looking bird to actually be a successful survival strategy or not, and sure enough, sometimes it works out and becomes a prominent trait, sometimes it does not.",
