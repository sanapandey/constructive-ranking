We recognize there is a lot of interest in objective explanations to ongoing events so we have created this space to allow those types of questions.\n\nPlease ask your question as top level comments (replies to the post) for others to reply to. The rules are still in effect, so no politics, no soapboxing, no medical advice, etc. We will ban users who use this space to make political, bigoted, or otherwise inflammatory points rather than objective topics/explanations.",

                    "body": "Drawing on an answer I wrote in last month's current events thread.\n\nThere are two main reasons to impose retaliatory tariffs.\n\nFirst, tariffs hit exporters in country A and this results in pressure on their government to resolve the situation - ie. to agree a mutual reduction in tariffs. That's why in this kind of situation you'll often see tariffs selectively aimed at vulnerable or politically important industries. (They may also be on luxury goods to limit the effect on domestic consumers.)\n\nSecond, tariffs give an advantage to domestic producers (and those of 'friendly' exporting countries). This is particularly important where industries are put at risk by losing an export market while still facing competition from imports.\n\nFor example, imagine I make widgets in country B and export most of them to country A. Country A's tariffs can shut me out of that market. Meanwhile my competitors in country A can get the advantages and economies of scale of selling in both A and B. So my government in country B introducing tariffs can help level the playing field, in one way.",

That is anything but the case.\n\nThat aside, there are three reasons why any deal would need to be okayed by the US.\n\nThe first is that the US is doing a bunch of things to support Ukraine and oppose Russia. It's important for any deal to be clear on which of these will continue. For example, will the US lift sanctions on Russia? Will it continue to provide military or economic support to Ukraine?\n\nSecond, building on that, what other things will the US be asked for? (Or indeed, ask for itself.) Most Western plans involve the US helping guarantee Ukrainian security in some way or other - ie. the US will help defend Ukraine against future Russian attacks. Or if part of the deal was that Ukraine were to join NATO, that would need the approval of the US (and every other NATO member. Not that this is a deal with any chance of Russia accepting it).\n\nAnd third, simply as a matter of goodwill. The US has been a major supporter of Ukraine through this conflict. For Ukraine and its other supporters to go off and agree a deal without consulting the US would be very undiplomatic.\n\n(Of course, given the way things are with the current US government, none of these are guaranteed in the future.)",

                    "body": "This question\u2019s probably worth asking on a more specialised subreddit, or at least as an ELI5 in its own right rather than on the current affairs post.\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely right that investment is an essential part of a healthy economy, and since (in econ 101) S \u2261 I, so are savings. But it\u2019s consumption that gets more attention when things are bad. That\u2019s probably because recessions are usually modelled as a failure of demand, and inflation is modelled as an excess of demand. Demand management also tends to act more quickly. Think about inflation: reducing demand should have a fairly quick effect on prices, whereas investment to increase supply will be a long-term effect.\n\nSo the dramatic actions by governments (and central banks) tend to be focused on consumption.\n\nHowever look at the UK today. One of the biggest reasons our economy has stagnated is a lack of productivity growth. There\u2019s a lot behind that, but it includes low savings rates leading to low investment, low investment by government, and (arguably) poor investment by the private sector. If we want to stop our economy stagnating, decent investment is going to be essential.\n\nJapan\u2019s another good example as it shows both sides of the coin. Japan has famously high rates of saving. These were crucial to its post-war growth. However demand was also essential \u2013 in particular having access to growing markets the country could export to.\n\nOne of the reasons that the Japanese economy has stagnated is that the export situation has changed a lot. Saving rates remain high, but companies with money to invest and expand have struggled to find markets to sell to.\n\nSo, I think your question\u2019s probably more complicated than you think, in an interesting way. Off the top of my head I can\u2019t think of any really good examples, but I\u2019m sure they exist \u2013 however they\u2019re probably framed in a slightly different way to how you\u2019re thinking.",

                    "body": "TL;DR: Tariffs can be \"bad\" for both the country that imposes them and the country that they get imposed on, but things are not equally \"bad\" for both sides and the consequences for the U.S. are worse in both cases here.\n\nLet's start with what a tariff is: a tax, or payment to a country's government, that a person pays when they bring something into that country. Since the person who pays the tax is the one who does the importing, they are usually doing so as part of a business, so the payment to the government ends up being made by that business. Of course, business doesn't like losing that money. Since the whole reason they imported the goods in the first place was to sell them to customers like you and I (oversimplifying a bit here), they usually decide to just charge the person who ultimately buys the goods more money to cover the cost of the tariff (again, oversimplifying a bit).\n\nNow that we know what a tariff is, let's think about how you might implement one. One way would be to impose your tariff on goods from every other country - we call that a \"unilateral\" tariff. You could also choose to only impose your tariff on a specific country - we call that a \"bilateral\" tariff. (If you're clever, you might notice that a country that is subject to a bilateral tariff from another country can kind-of-sort-of-in-a-way get around it by exporting their goods to a third, neutral country and then to the country that imposed the tariff. That's actually already happening with some Chinese exports in an attempt to get around the new tariffs the US recently imposed on them.) \n\nSo you've decided who will be subject to your tariffs, but there is still the question of what goods will be subject to them. You could choose to target everything, no matter what it is, or you could pick and choose specific items to be taxed (or to be exempt from taxation).\n\nHere's the really important thing: different countries export different amounts of different things, so a bilateral tariff on all goods is *kind of* like a unilateral tariff on a specific good. If Country A is the source of 95% of the world's Examplium, then when country B imposes a tariff on all goods from Country A, only 5% of the world's Examplium is not subject to that tariff! In the real world, there is way more than a single good to worry about and things aren't anywhere near as clear-cut, but the tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump is toying with are similar in that they are also bilateral tariffs on all goods originating from the affected countries.\n\nIt's pretty obvious why those U.S. tariffs are bad for those in the U.S. - the cost of all goods that the country imports primarily from Canada, Mexico, and/or China will go up - but it's also true that they can be bad for the target countries. When the price of Examplium goes up in Country A, the citizens of Country A might respond by purchasing less of it or by purchasing Examplium imported from Country C instead of Country B. In both cases, Country B is losing business and therefore losing income that originally came from Country A.\n\nSo, why are people more upset about Trump's tariffs than the retaliatory ones? It turns out that the U.S. runs a fairly substantial trade deficit - that means it imports significantly more goods than it exports (in terms of value, which you might measure in U.S. Dollars). When you have a trade deficit, and especially when you have a big one like the U.S. does, tariffs have a bigger effect on your economy. (Incidentally, Trump's reasoning here is that this means way, way more income for the U.S. government, which it would end up getting if U.S. consumers didn't change their buying habits at all, but those consumers don't have infinite money - remember how Country A's citizens responded to the Examplium tariff from earlier!) Also, when you have a trade deficit, your country is essentially exporting *value itself* (i.e., money) to make up the difference (e.g., through borrowing), so it's important to support what exports you do have.  On the other hand, if you have a trade surplus (more exports than imports), it's like your *importing* money, which puts you in a position of leverage because you are accruing the one thing that everyone wants. And, as a nice bonus, tariffs don't hurt trade surplus economies as much because they don't import as much in the first place.\n\nNow, let's put all of that together: the U.S. tariffs are worse for the U.S. than they are for their targets (Canada, Mexico, and China) because the U.S. imports way more than it exports, so U.S. citizens will end up paying more for many different types of goods (most of what isn't made locally, in fact). The retaliatory tariffs are worse for the U.S. because they are being imposed by countries who have trade surpluses (or at the very least, trade deficits that aren't as high), meaning they have some economic leverage over the U.S. (which would really like to protect its exports to keep its deficit from worsening) and the resulting price increases won't effect as many goods.\n\nOh, and one more thing: even though the U.S. is shooting itself in the foot by imposing these new tariffs, they will do at least a little damage to the economies of the target countries, which is the whole reason why Trump is imposing them in the first place. As a result, Canada, Mexico, and China can easily seize the moral high ground here and return fire with what many will perceive as Righteous Indignation. If you made it all the way through this comment, thank you! I'm glad you're willing to take your time thinking about this complicated but very important topic.",

Pig exports/imports between Canada and the US. The US exports almost no pigs to Canada but Canada exports a large amount of pigs to the US. This is the trade surplus you talked about in your post.\n\nHowever, the relative sizes of the countries are massively different. The US pig market only imports 1.5% of their pigs form Canada, where as the Canadian pig market exports 10% of its pigs to the US.\n\nIf the US made all Canadian pigs to expensive to buy, the US would still have 98.5% of their pig supply. They would only have to increase production a little bit to make up for that loss. Whereas on the other side if the Canadian pig market suddenly lost 10% of their buyers (the US) that would have MAJOR effects on that industry.\n\nI am not saying I support these tariffs, but there is more to the picture on trade wars and who has the most leverage.",

However, as others have alluded to or pointed out in this mega-thread, that is not the case.\n\nRegarding a \"goal post,\" it is unfortunately very difficult to reliably predict exactly what U.S. President Donald Trump is hoping to achieve here. Trump has a long history of claiming/threatening that he will do things that are dramatic or unprecedented, but the degree to which he actually follows up on those claims/threats varies wildly. Because a trade \"war\" is an entirely non-military effort, going straight from raising tariffs to sending literal armed forces into Canada (or any other country, for that matter) would be a *major* and highly unprecedented escalation. That said, it's difficult to rule out that possibly due to how unstable and unpredictable the executive branch of the U.S. government is given that Trump is in charge of it.\n\nWhatever his actual objective is or ends up being, Trump's stated goal is twofold. He hopes that his tariffs will (1) force companies to make their goods in the U.S. to avoid paying the associates taxes and (2) dramatically increase the revenue that the U.S. federal government brings in without having to increase the amount that U.S. residents pay in other kinds of taxes directly. As has already been discussed at length across the internet, assuming those are Trump's actual goals, there are a number of problems with the approach that the U.S. is taking. Notable issues include that the tariffs are being imposed on *all* imports from the affected countries, that countries like China are already exploiting workarounds like rerouting their exports to the U S. through another country, and that tariffs are, in practice, an additional tax levied on consumers in the country that imposes them.\n\nAs for Canada, Mexico, and China, their goals are similar and relatively straightforward: they just want the U.S. to stop the tariffs. As I explained in another comment in this mega-thread, although the U.S. tariffs do hurt the U.S. more than Canada, Mexico, and China, those three countries are still negatively impacted (which, to Trump, is the whole point of this exercise). One of the best ways for them to put pressure on the U.S. to do so is to impose tariffs of their own on the types of goods that the U.S. exports to them. Higher tariffs mean higher pressure, which is how trade \"wars\" (in this case, back-and-forth exchanges of new tariffs or higher tariff rates) happen.",

Under normal circumstances, everyone wants to avoid a shut down, but this year there was a controversy over whether it would be worse to have a shut down or worse to vote for this continuing resolution (CR) due to extra items that were added to it. Ultimately the CR passed.\n\nWhy was there such controversy this time? This year's continuing resolution (CR) threatens the checks and balances of our government. It adds sections to the resolution that will consolidate the power of the Executive Branch while taking power away from the Legislative Branch and the Judicial Branch. \n\nEach year Congress usually decides how the government spends money in a process called appropriations. Lawmakers negotiate and pass detailed funding bills that outline how much money each department and program will get and how they should use it. But this year's continuing resolution skips that process.\u00a0Instead of setting clear rules, it lets Trump\u2019s administration decide where much of the money goes.\n\nAs you may be aware, the Executive Branch through DOGE has been dismantling essential services in our government. This includes the people who predict our weather (NOAA), who help people after disasters (FEMA), who monitor our nuclear facilities (DOE), who provide many of us with health insurance and who help veterans, etc. These actions were illegal and the courts have been fighting these actions.\n\nBut due to this year's CR being passed, the courts will no longer have authority to continue lawsuits against the Executive Branch. This is because this CR will legalize the illegal actions that the Executive Branch have been taking.\n\nThis year's CR also gives the president the right to cut any program without Congressional approval. This is why many right now are concerned about cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, Veterans services, and Cancer research.\n\nUsually, there is a negotiation over the budget. The Senate had the power of the filibuster to block these significant changes from taking place but they failed to use the filibuster. Instead they voted for something called cloture which means that the filibuster must end so the vote can take place.",

Either way, I\u2019m aware that other states do not require any ID when casting their votes. How is this allowed? I\u2019m aware that not everyone is able to obtain a drivers license or afford a different type of ID card, like a passport perhaps or a state ID, both of which include a fee; and I believe this should not be a barrier to voting in your own country. No payment should be involved in voting imo. \n\nHowever, how do other states verify you are an American citizen then? Couldn\u2019t I vote in MA with my license and then travel to another state that doesn\u2019t have ID requirements and go under a different name just to vote in that state?\n\nJust curious about how it works (or perhaps doesn\u2019t).

I do not support Trumps immigration policies and I believe there is a better why to handle immigration but my post has nothing to do with immigrants, either legal or illegal, but I do believe you need to be an American citizen, and somehow be verified as one, in order to vote in American elections.",

About half are controlled by the US - for example Ramstein Airbase in Germany or RAF Mildenhall in the UK. There are about 100,000 US military personnel in Europe. ([See here.](https://www.cfr.org/article/where-are-us-forces-deployed-europe#:~:text=Source%3A%20International%20Institute%20for%20Strategic%20Studies.&text=More%20than%20forty%20U.S.%20military,Poland%2C%20and%20the%20United%20Kingdom.))\n\nAre these \"NATO\" bases though? Well that's where things are a little confusing. The US is a member of NATO, so its military bases are NATO bases. But on that basis, so is every other military base in a NATO country. The US bases were largely been established and maintained in order to serve NATO's purposes. But they're still *American* bases and not limited to NATO operations. For example Ramstein is a major US military logistics hub, used heavily in the second Iraq war, and it's now a centre for drone operations.\n\nStepping away from NATO takes us into the question of \"why *does* the US have so many bases and personnel in Europe?\"\n\nPart of that is to serve NATO's goals of collective security. If a major military worry is Soviet troops attacking Europe, then it helps to have US forces ready and waiting to help fight. Perhaps just as importantly these bases would also help the US rapidly expand its presence in Europe if necessary. They also allow easier training and coordination with European NATO members.\n\nPost Cold-War? Well the role of NATO, and of US bases in Europe, after the fall of the Soviet Union is less clear. Those bases do still serve as a sign of US commitment to European and global security (or at least, a particular kind of security order), and training & coordination are still important. They're still there if Russia *does* try anything.\n\nJust as important as that, they extend US military power. If you want to project military power anywhere from North Africa to Eastern Europe or the Middle East, or even further afield to to Sub-Saharan Africa or Central Asia, then bases in Europe are very helpful to have.",

It sets a threshold for the amount of an item that can be imported at a specific duty rate (ex $100 item imported at 10% duty means the importer pays the US government $10 per item). Once you import a quantity equal to that threshold, any further items will be subject to a higher tariff rate.\n\nSo that $100 item starts out with a 10% tariff, but say the threshold is 1000 items, item 1001 (over-quota) will go up to say 15% duty or whatever the case may be. \n\nThe idea is to protect domestic production, as is generally the economic idea behind most tariffs. You want to make it more expensive to buy overseas so domestic markets can compete. In the case of the TRQ, you don't want to limit imports entirely with a hard stop quota (ex 1000 items and no more) but you do want to make it less likely for people to import larger quantities of said item. \n\nThis is different from a regular tariff which generally just says \"these items are given x% / $x duty\"",

For example, Canada has long had a tariff on American dairy to prevent their own cattle industry from being buried under a pile of poor quality, government subsidized American products. This is the same reason the US has a universal tariff on steel, with China flooding the world markets with more low-quality steel then is really necessary. The idea is that if a critical industry is priced out of the country you're vulnerable to your supplier squeezing concessions out of you.\n\nOne of the most controversial uses of tariffs is just to raise prices on imports so that your own native industries have lower prices in comparison, thus theoretically giving them a competitive boost. However that generally doesn't work out so well. All it tends to do is raise prices for consumers.",

In this case it really is as simple as it seems.\n\n>Wasn\u2019t the entire point of Trump\u2019s economic plan was to lower prices?\n\n*Cough* well... at best, Trump's plans mixed some things aimed at inflation (increasing energy supplies, improving supply chains, deregulation) with some things that would increase inflation (tariffs, immigration crackdowns, less government action to promote competition). Though the general expert consensus was that even the things aimed at inflation would have little effect.\n\nOne of the administration's executive orders made tackling inflation the responsibility of all departments of government, which seemed a lot like spreading responsibility so thin it disappeared.\n\nAs it turns out, after saying that \"[s]tarting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again, to bring down the prices of all goods\", Trump appears to have pushed inflation down the priority list. From [this article](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/01/nx-s1-5282353/trump-economy-prices-inflation):\n\n>\"They all said inflation was the No. 1 issue,\" Trump said about the presidential campaign as he spoke to supporters at the Capitol following his inauguration address. \"I said, 'I disagree. I think people coming into our country from prisons and from mental institutions is a bigger issue for the people that I know.' And I made it my No. 1. I talked about inflation, too, but you know how many times can you say that an apple has doubled in cost?\"",

There\u2019s too much speculation.\n\nThe whole idea of annexation is so implausible it feels like you\u2019re speculating about the contents of Donald Trump\u2019s brain more than building on anything grounded.\n\nYou\u2019d think the NATO treaty would be something more concrete we could talk about, but even this is not clear. The treaty wasn\u2019t written with conflicts between member states in mind, so it\u2019s not explicit. This is actually a long-running question, as part of the reason both Greece and Turkey are members of NATO is to defend against each other.\n\nArticle 5 doesn\u2019t say it can\u2019t be invoked against another member. Also, attacking another member would likely be considered a breach of the treaty. However working out the consequences of this would be just as much a matter of diplomacy as the treaty itself. Every aggressor tries to argue they\u2019re only defending themselves, after all. The treaty isn\u2019t even explicit on what states have to do if Article 5 is invoked \u2013 they have to treat it as an attack on them, but what exactly does that mean?\n\nIt's also worth noting that independently of NATO, Denmark is part of the EU and covered by its collective security provisions. And a further note: if the US *did* invade and occupy Greenland, it would almost certainly be impossible for the rest of NATO to retake it militarily \u2013 although it\u2019s such an outlandish situation to imagine, we could imagine all sorts of other strange stuff going on, like splits in the US military.",

Another might be implementing a formal mentorship program for minorities because the likelihood of those relationships occurring naturally might be low (due to the low number of minorities in upper management). It can include policies and training on harassment and other harmful workplace behaviors. A wide variety of things fall under the umbrella of DEI, and they help more than just women and minorities.\n\nAffirmative action started in the 1960s during the Kennedy Administration.

In this case it was meant that they would take active steps to ensure minorities weren't being discriminated against.\n\nIn either case, opponents of both have attempted, with some success, to advance the idea that DEI and Affirmative Action mean favoring otherwise unqualified candidates for jobs or college enrollment simply because they are Black, or a woman, or trans, or some other marginalized person.",

That said, the explanation that makes the most sense to me involves the sheer magnitude of the differences between modern civilizations and North Sentinel Islanders. If you travelled back in time 500 years and brought your smartphone with you, there's a decent chance you'd be tried as a witch and burned at the stake! We are a superstitious species and have survived through hundreds of thousands of years of evolution by being cautious of things that we do not understand or that are not \"normal\" to us. For example, most so-called \"vaccine skeptics\" are against vaccination because they do not know, misunderstand, or, in rare cases, choose to believe something untrue about what is in vaccines and/or what they do to the body. If you live in a small town and both of the toddlers in your life all got very sick after receiving a sizable round of vaccinations at age 3, you might blame the \"mystery fluid\" that some doctor injected into the poor, defenseless children while claiming it would protect them instead of the lead poisoning that's very slowly (and therefore relatively unnoticeably) killing your entire community.\n\nAs for the idea that curiosity would get the better of them, that's very possible, but we must also consider groupthink here. The civilization has a shared identity defined in part by their isolation, so anyone venturing out would likely be traveling alone or in a very small group. On top of that, they don't speak our languages, don't recognize our traditions, fear our technology, and don't need to leave their homeland due to a catastrophic event like a volcano eruption, ecological collapse, or invasion by an opposing power. With all that in mind, I think the better question might be \"why would they ever consider leaving?\" I mean, Japan intentionally isolated itself for centuries and only stopped doing so when the United States famously arrived on huge boats with guns (gunboats) and said \"open the country; stop having it be closed.\" Japan only capitulated because they couldn't possibly defend themselves against that kind of force at the time. As long as the rest of the world allows them to, the North Sentinel Islanders are probably happy to stay right where they are.",

They establish tariffs because they know that the American made products will be more expensive, yet deny that products will be more expensive?! \n\nIf there is a secret plan to make up for the tariffs which makes all of us \"richer\" then why isn't Trump using that to try to persuade the other (slightly less than) half of the country?",

                    "body": "Here is the non-politically biased answer to the question. \n\nFirst, you need to understand the context of tariffs. Prior to the last few months, there were TONS of tariffs between the US and other countries already in place, and these tariffs went in both directions. Tariffs are a very common economic tool. \n\nFor example, Canada has been long concerned about its dairy industry so it imposes a tariff on any dairy products imported from the US. This tariff has been in place since the 1970's but has changed several times. Currently, this tariff starts at 7.5%, and then once imports exceed a certain number, it balloons to 241%-300%.\n\nThis is an example of a tariff working as intended. Making US dairy products much more expensive to maintain domestic dairy production.\n\nNow let's look at the recent steel and aluminum tariffs the US has put in place. Currently, the US manufactures 80% of its steel and imports 20%. And it manufactures 50% of its aluminum and imports the other 50%.\n\nThere is not \"secret plan\" to these tariffs. The goal is to make imported steel and aluminum more expensive so that those domestic materials become more competitive. The goal is to see domestic production of these metals increase and imports decrease.\n\nThat's all there is to this. No big conspiracy, no secret plans. It's just an economic gambit. Will the long-term benefits of the tariffs outweigh the pain of the immediate price increases?",

They can also be mixed together.\n\nThe first one is fairly straightforward. Threats of tariffs are intended to get something out of other countries. That could be tighter border control from Mexico, it could be reduced tariffs or standards for US imports from Canada or the EU, or improving access to markets in China. The fact that tariffs keep getting threatened, scheduled, postponed lends some credence to the idea they're primarily a negotiating tactic. (Though there are plenty of other plausible explanations.)\n\nThis also potentially comes closest to the \"secret plan\" idea. If you're going into a negotiation with a threat, you want to make the other side feel like the threat doesn't cost you anything. In fact, we do know Trump uses negotiating tactics like this, going in with an extreme position. Of course, that's also a convenient excuse for when a plan doesn't work out - \"I never really believed it, it was just a negotiating tactic.\"\n\nTariffs as negotiating tactic also ties into the idea that the US has a lot of power and leverage that it hasn't used - it's been too nice to the rest of the world and is being exploited as a result; it doesn't really need imports or exports that much; and tariffs really *won't* hurt the US as much as they do other countries. This also applies when people think about retaliatory tariffs in the next part.\n\nThe idea that tariffs could be good for the US economy is a bit more complicated.\n\nBroadly speaking tariffs can benefit domestic employment at the cost of higher prices for consumers and industries using imports. Is this a good or a bad thing? Well it very much depends on your priorities. If you live in the rust belt and imports make cars more expensive for the whole country, but manufacture comes back to *your city* you might think that's a win. Manufacturing is also psychologically important for many people and is especially linked with masculinity - manly jobs making things rather than service sector jobs dealing with people or computers.\n\nJudiciously applied tariffs are in fact a common left wing policy. They're often recommended for developing countries or industries. They can be recommended against countries with worse environmental or labour standards, to soften the social harm of a declining industry (think of the lasting damage to rust belt US or mining areas in the UK) or to protect strategic industries (one reason so many countries, including the US, have tariffs, subsidies or other protections for food production). That's not to say that I'd recommend doing it *this* way, but in principle tariffs can help a country achieve its economic goals.\n\nTariffs are also a common far-right policy, with the aim of making a country more of an \"autarky\", that is, not dependent on other countries (except maybe colonies) for its needs. This, of course, can be beneficial if you're going to go to war or just generally piss off other countries. Yes, living standards will fall, but it's for a larger cause.\n\nLastly, as a source of government revenue, tariffs put a burden on consumers and importers, but the money can be used to reduce other taxes or pay for spending.\n\n*Edit:* It is also striking how quickly Trump and some prominent supporters have gone from talking up how great the economy will be to going \"a recession? it could well happen.\"",
