    "selftext": "So obviously Canada was a colony just like the United States but the history was never taught to me in my schooling here in the US. I know that Canada also has close ties to french culture (in parts?) But they also use British monarchs on their currency. Also I read a post where the joke was that someone wasn't really Canadian because they didn't spell behavior with an ou, this I understand to be a thing in England? I have also heard that the hudson bay company was like the Dutch east India company and had a big influence on early settling and this company had an english charter? I just want to understand and bit more.\n\n\n",

            "body": "Well as you noted, Canada (or more accurately, the provinces that would become Canada) was once a colony of Great Britain (which is now the United Kingdom.) The French influence, particularly in Quebec, is because what is now basically the Eastern half of Canada were French colonies until 1763, when they were ceded to Great Britain.\n\nIn the 1860's and 1870's Canada went through a process called confederation, where the various separate colonies were united into a single political entity called the Dominion of Canada, which was still, in some sense, a colony of the United Kingdom, although it had some degree of self rule. In 1931, The UK granted all of its dominions, including Canada, nearly full independence. In 1982, Canada passed a law that gave itself full constitutional and legislative independence from the UK.\n\nToday, Canada (along with 14 other countries) is a Commonwealth Realm. Commonwealth Realms are sovereign, independent nations that all have the same monarch, who is the monarch of the United Kingdom - presently Charles III.\n\nAlthough Canada is a fully independent country, it has close cultural and political ties to the UK because of their shared monarch and Canada's long history as a British subject.",

            "body": "You've hit on a lot of things but i'll try to address each: \n\n1) Colony of Great Britain: Canada was a colony of GB just like the USA, although large parts of what would become Canada was first colonized by the french. This was won by Britain in the 7 Years War (Known as the French and Indian War in America). This French population in Canada was afforded protection of their culture, language and religion (Catholics) These French populations made up the majority of Canada during the American rebellion and they remained loyal to the crown as they did not trust the french to provide the same protections. Later to be validated by the destruction of french language and culture in Louisiana. After the US revolution many American English loyalists escaped to Canada, making the nation more English but with a strong French component still. \n\nCanada had some small rebellions itself over the years but overall stayed loyal. \n\n2) British Monarchy: As noted above, Canada remained loyal to the Crown. Ultimately negotiating it's nominal independence from Britain in 1867, but still recognizing the monarchy as head of Canada. King Charles III is Canada's head of state today. Importantly it should be noted it's a separate title over Canada, so King Charles is King of Canada, separate from King of the United Kingdom.  This means that even if the UK became a republic, theoretically Canada would still be a monarchy regardless. \n\n3) In general Canadian English is generally similarly spelled to British English. Not just with the ou spelling be also with things like spelling the word center, centre. And while in accent closer to US pronunciation you get things in spoken language like Z being pronounced 'zed' and not 'zee.' \n\n4) Hudson Bay Company - More or less operated similarly to the British East India Company (Or Dutch variant), yes. It had it's own forts, ships and militia forces controlling most of what we call Canada today. They even fought limited 'wars' with the North West Company. They sold this land to Canada, which caused something called the Red River Rebellion, which resulted in a province called Manitoba being created and giving rights to people called the Metis. The Hudson Bay Company actually still exists today, although maybe be on it's last legs. (It just filed for bankruptcy this month)",

            "body": "Canada was originally settled as a French colony as New France along the St Lawrence River. Similarly French colonies were set up in today's New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and their remains a significant French speaking population there.\n\nThe word 'Canada' derives from the Huron-Iroquois word 'Kanata' which means 'the village'. The word was mistaken as the name of the land the settlers arrived in.\n\nBritish forces led by General James Wolfe defeated French forces under the Montcalm in 1759, leading to the surrender of Quebec and the eventual loss of New France to Britain. The last battle was fought at the Plains of Abraham just outside Quebec City.\n\nCanada recognizes the legacy of these French settlers and the descended Quebecois as a 'distinct society' in Canada which in part helps protect the French language and culture. Both French and English are recognized as the official languages of Canada and all government services and documents must be available in both French and English. Tous les services et documents gouvernementaux doivent \u00eatre disponibles en Fran\u00e7ais et en Anglais.\n\nThe American Revolutionary War was fought 15 years later but the Canadian territories decided not to join in and remained loyal to British Empire. Canada's reasons for not joining with the US at the time are complex.\n\nCanadians didn't feel the need to revolt the same way as the Americans did, and felt more loyalty to the British. Canada back then was as different from the US culturally as it is now, and didn't feel they had been exploited the same way as the American colonies. The large percentage of French settlers in Canada in particular were weary of joining the US given previous conflicts between the two. Their concerns were later proven correct by the treatment of the French in Louisiana.\n\nThe US later invaded Canada starting the War of 1812 but were soundly defeated by British forces. British forces made it as far south as Washington DC and even burned down the White House in retaliation for attacking Canada. \n\nIn 1867 Canada became its own country 'the Dominion of Canada' consisting of Upper and Lower Canada (Which became today's Quebec and Ontario albeit with much less territory than today) as well as New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. Canada setup a Parliamentary system similar to England's and recognized the British monarch (at the time Queen Victoria) as the head of state of Canada. King Charles III is recognized as the King of Canada today, although his actual political powers are effectively non-existent.\n\nMuch of what is Canada today used to be Rupert's Land, territory owned by the Hudson's Bay Company (which continues to exist today as the Hudson Bay stores). Like the British East India Company The Hudson Bay Company was setup to extract wealth and resources from the new territories.\n\nThe fur trade in particular was incredibly lucrative to Britain and early Canada. Canada made a push to settle the Western territories and an ensuing flood of mostly British settlers resulted in a revolt in 1870. The Red River Metis people (a group of Half french, half Native American fur traders) already lived in those territories and revolted against the Canadian government in the hopes of getting their own political representation. This resulted in the creation of the Province of Manitoba, despite its leader Louis Riel being branded a traitor and later hanged.\n\nThis was followed by British Columbia (1871), Prince Edward Island (1873), Alberta and Saskatchewan (1905), and more recently Newfoundland and Labrador (1949).\n\nIn the convention of 1818 it was decided that the future border of Canada and the US from Lake of the Woods > West would be the 49th parallel, which remains the case to this day. Both Canada and the US were quickly expanding West to gain control of the territories and the treaty helped avoid future territorial disputes.\n\nIn time the fur trade became less profitable and Rupert's Land was transferred to Canada as 'The North West Territories'. These were divided up with time which much of them becoming parts of today's provinces greatly increasing their size. This transfer was the 2nd amendment of the Canadian Constitution.\n\nSo the US has a right to bear arms, and Canadian provinces got a lot more territory.\n\nCanada's territories though proved to be full of valuable resources like timber and minerals. Railroads were built in Canada heading West for the same reasons they were built in the US.\n\nWhile the less populated Northern parts of Canada remain Territories. Yukon and the NorthWest Territories. They have their own governments but with far less autonomy than the southern provinces and therefore rely on the Federal Government considerably more.\n\nIn 1999 the Northwest Territories split into two territories with the founding of Nunavut.\n\nToday Canada maintains a close relationship with Britain and other former territories known as the Commonwealth.\n\nCanada fought with Britain in WW1 and WW2 from the very beginning, from the defeat and evacuation at Dunkirk storming the beaches on D-Day, liberating Holland, and the march onto Germany.",

France later ceded it's territories to the British as reparations (not sure if that's the right word) for the Seven Years War ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1763))).\n\nIn 1867 the UK parliament enacted the [British North America Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_North_America_Acts) (BNA Act). This was functionally Canada's first constitution. This created the Dominion of Canada and gave Canada self governance; however, some powers remained with the British parliament (e.g. military powers).\n\nThe [Statute of Westminster 1931](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster_1931) was an act of the UK parliament that was negotiated with and ratified by the [commonwealth realms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_realm) which gave them significantly moire sovereignty. It established the separate but linked monarchies of each of the commonwealth realms thus making the monarchies of Canada, Australia, NZ, etc. equal to the British monarchy. This means that Charles III is coequally the King of each of these countries separately.\n\nThe final step to Canada becoming fully sovereign was the [Constitution Act 1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Act,_1982).

Because of the established French speaking population, the language and other elements of the French way of doing things remained. The Maritimes (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island) were each their own colonies of Britain. Ontario was established as an extension of Quebec but with English speaking British loyalists settlers, so was separated from Quebec. British Columbia was an entirely separate British colony.\n\nThe Hudson Bay company basically ran the rest, as a fur trade region, but without active colonization. Basically the HBC had a few trading posts, and owned the land on paper, but in practice had minimal meaningful control.\n\nAfter the US civil war there was a concern that the strong US military was a threat to all of this, so Britain encouraged these colonies and lands to be joined together as a single federal entity that could govern and defend itself.\n\nThe new entity had a high degree of autonomy and self government but not full independence, particularly on things like foreign policy.\n\nThe experience and contribution to the First World War created a strong sense of national identity and a desire for Canada to have equal rather than subordinate status with Britain. This resulted in the Westminster act of 1933 that created Canada as a sovereign country, and split the crown: the King became King of Canada as a separate and distinct role to that of King of the United Kingdom, but still with the same person.",
