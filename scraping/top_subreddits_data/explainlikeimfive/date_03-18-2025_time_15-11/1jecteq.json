You eat what you know because it's safe, basically, trained by what is demonstrated to you by elders and peers and available in your environment.\n\n\nIdentifying \"food\" is step 1. Consuming food and all the chewing and digestion and whatnot is step 2.\n\n\nIf you drastically alter something, whether that's by letting it rot or throwing it in a blender, it is no longer the thing you know as safe and nutritious. You skipped step 1 so your body doesnt want to go to step 2. The instinct is to reject it as \"not food\".\u00a0\n\n\nNow, I mentioned the conditioning thing.\u00a0 if you fed someone nothing but meal slurry it's likely they would come to expect that and it becomes \"food\" identifiable in step 1.",

You know what texture and flavors are supposed to go together so when they don't, it sets off alarm bells, same way as biting into something and finding it is soft when it ahouldn't be or hard when it shouldn't be.\n\nYour experience with this particular flavor or smell or whatever is telling you it should NOT be in liquid form and so something must be wrong with it.",

Drinking doesn't really do the same thing. Especially when you're talking about a full meal with fiber, protein, salt, complex carbohydrates, sugar, and fat that have all been blended.",

Digestion isn't simply mashing up food, it's breaking it down into it's component parts, which saliva plays a big role in. It's like going straight to high pressure soap at the car wash without doing the pre soak, all the caked on stuff isn't going to wash off.",

            "body": "A few things here:\n\n1) eating the food is different than digesting the food. Yes, it all ends up in your stomach and gets digested together, but you don\u2019t have taste buds in your stomach, but you do in your mouth. So mixing things that shouldn\u2019t go together is fine in your stomach but could cause unpleasant taste in your mouth. Yes, there are foods that are meant to be eaten together. But that doesn\u2019t mean all food should be chewed at the same time. \n\n2) just blending things typically isn\u2019t enough to make it drinkable. Most food would be too viscous to just blend and drink by itself. You have to add some kind of liquid to make it drinkable. \n\n3) your sense of smell and sense of taste are very linked. This is why things can taste different when you have a cold/flu as the congestion lessons your sense of smell. By blending the food, you will dampen some of the smells as many of the fragrances that would be released upon chewing instead get released when you blend it, leaving duller tastes. Going back to item 1, this also means smells of things that might be eaten separately get blended together which can make less pleasant smells and therefore taste. And going back to item 2, blending your food with some type of liquid will also counteract some of the depth of those smells as well, making it taste flat.",
