I'm not a writer or really a creative of any kind, but sometimes it so obvious that a line was written horribly, or a decision on plot was so asinine that it baffles me the entire writes room didn't immediately shoot it down. Are people just too afraid to push back, do they just not care? How can some of these shows and movies have such large budgets and experienced teams but still end up with absolute garbage?",
