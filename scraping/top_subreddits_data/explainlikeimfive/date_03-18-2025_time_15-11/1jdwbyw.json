            "body": "Thunderstorms form when warm, moist air rises quickly, cools, and condenses into storm clouds. The temperature difference between the warm ground and cool atmosphere allows lightning. \n\nSnowstorms usually happen in cold weather when air is stable, meaning there\u2019s less rising warm air. The air is also drier in winter, making it harder for big clouds to form.",

In the winter of 1968 I thought I was going to die at the top of [Loveland Pass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loveland_Pass). At just under 12,000 feet, it is one of the higher passes in the Rocky Mountains that has a road over it.\n\nI don't know at how low of an elevation it occurs, but I do know it requires a strong uplift as part of its dynamics, which mostly means *mountains*.",
