How do things like videos, messages, and games travel through the air and show up perfectly on my phone or computer? It seems kind of like magic, how does the router know where to send everything?",

                            "body": "> In WPA2-protected WLANs, secure communication is established through a multi-step process. Initially, devices associate with the Access Point (AP) via an association request. This is followed by a 4-way handshake, a crucial step ensuring both the client and AP have the correct Pre-Shared Key (PSK) without actually transmitting it. During this handshake, a Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) is generated for secure data exchange.  \nWPA2 employs the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a 128-bit key, enhancing security through the Counter-Mode/CBC-Mac Protocol CCMP. This protocol ensures robust encryption and data integrity, using different Initialization Vectors (IVs) for encryption and authentication purposes.\n\n>The 4-way handshake involves:\n\n>- The AP sending a random number (ANonce) to the client.  \n>- The client responding with its random number (SNonce).  \n>- The AP calculating the PTK from these numbers and sending an encrypted message to the client.  \n>- The client decrypting this message with the PTK, confirming successful authentication.  \n>- Post-handshake, the established PTK is used for encrypting **unicast traffic**, and the Group Temporal Key (GTK) is used for **broadcast traffic**. This comprehensive authentication and encryption mechanism is what makes WPA2 a robust security standard for wireless networks.\n\nboth of those temporal keys(PTK/GTK) follow the [TKIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_Key_Integrity_Protocol) standard",

Visible light is just one example of an electromagnetic wave, one that encodes information about the filament or LED that emitted it.  If you had the equipment to decode that information, you'd be able to extract information about the bulb from that electromagnetic wave.\n\nWiFi works the same way - the router sends out electromagnetic waves in all directions that spreads until something blocks it.  The router encodes information into the wave, and if you have the equipment to detect and decode that information (like a WiFi receiver and software in your phone or computer), you can use it for all sorts of things.\n\nJust like visible light can be blocked by a wall but not a clear window, WiFi signals are blocked by some things (metal especially) but not by others (so they can travel through thin walls easily).  And just like visible light fades with distance (as it spreads out), so too do WiFi signals (which is why the signal is lost as you move farther and farther away from the router).\n\nThe signal doesn't know where to go - it's not directed at your phone or aimed anywhere - it just spreads out uniformly and if you're close enough to receive it, a clever bit of hardware and software knows how to extract the information encoded in the signal.",

Instead, your device will generate a new address when it connects to a network, and remember that going forward. \n\nThe reason is privacy.

I'll leave out all the math, but basically, if a wifi device did that, it would run over just about everything else trying to use the airwaves, and consume way more power than necessary in the process. Instead, in order to share the spectrum well, wifi devices re-encode the digital data into other waveforms that play better with other users of the spectrum and also are engineered to be intelligible at the receiver even in the face of distortions. This raises the amusing idea that to send digital data, you have to go analog again, but, well, we've been there since the days of dialup modems. As you might expect, receivers have gotten extremely sophisticated with their strategies for recovering the original transmitted data.\n\n**Integrity check and retries:** Even with all the engineering involved, data does get corrupted in transit. I believe there are general theorems out there relating data rates and capacity to error probabilities, and suggesting that you can get a significant increase in both data rate and capacity in exchange for a tolerable increase in error. To make sure data makes it, there are integrity checks performed at multiple levels, and depending on the application, corrupted data may be resent, or it may be simply dropped and compensated for.\n\n**Multiple access:** Even if wifi devices play well with other types of devices by way of efficient use of the spectrum, they also have to play well with each other. Earlier wifi standards employ a \"collision avoidance\" scheme where they make sure nothing else is transmitting before they attempt to transmit, and then wait for acknowledgement from the access point that the packet was received, retrying appropriately if needed. This is obviously possibly terribly inefficient, so there's also RTS/CTS where devices request an exclusive transmission time window from the access point. Later standards introduce the ability for multiple devices to actually send and receive transmissions simultaneously (beamforming, multiple radios, OFDMA).",

Each packet names its destination, and other radios ignore it.   \n  \nELI A little older: There are many layers of technology enabling wi-fi, but fundamentally they are two-way packet radios, usually operating in the 2.4GHz or 5.0GHz frequency bands. Data is cut up into packets, modulated onto their carrier frequency, and broadcast. Intended receivers pick up their packets, demodulate them, and route them.    \n  \nA little deeper and trying to ignore the details of TCP/IP and focusing on the physical layer follows. \n\nFirst, think of traditional, AM/FM analog radio. This is a one way system\u2014your receiver can't transmit back. A transmitter sends audio that is modulated onto a carrier wave at a specific frequency (98.7FM Q-98 Always Rockin' or KFGO The Mighty 790). The M in AM and FM stands for Modulation. Your receiver demodulates that signal and turns it back into audio that eventually comes out of a speaker. It's a quick leap from that to two-way radios like CB, walkie-talkies or cop radios. They do the same thing, but each station can both send and receive. \n\nSecond, think of old-school modems. Modem is short for modulator/demodulator, and is basically the same principle as radio transmission, but over copper phone lines. They took data and converted into packets and modulated it onto the carrier\u2014in this case, audio frequency waves transmitted over regular analog phone lines (POTS\u2014plain old telephone service). \n\nFinally, smash them together. The wi-fi radio in your router and the wi-fi radios in all of your devices have unique IDs called MAC addresses. When a radio transmits a packet, it specifies the destination, and other radios ignore it if it's not addressed to them. \n\nThere are several layers of error correction, but basically, each packet also contains a checksum, which is a value calculated from its contents. If the receiver's checksum doesn't match the sender's, the receiver asks for the packet to be sent again (depending on the protocol).",

A fork stuck in the jello at the other end of the room wiggles a little bit. Interpret the wiggles on the 2nd fork and you've just received a radio signal. \n\nWiFi is a fancy name for a radio signal.",
