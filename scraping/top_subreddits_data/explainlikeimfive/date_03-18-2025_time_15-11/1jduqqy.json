Fiber slows your body's absorption of simple sugars, meaning if you eat sugar and fiber at the same time, you don't get as big of a spike in your blood sugar as if you ate the sugar alone.",

As a third it also fills you up for longer in terms of satiation, which can and does generally translate to eating less calories the more wholefoods and fibre you eat.\n\nFibre is one of the highest correlated dietary predictors of general health and all cause mortality and it's dramatically overlooked in general dietary discussion.",

Our digestive track can barely make a dent on them (cows need 4 stomachs to process it, and other animals have to do mutiple digestions in *other* ways) and because of that, it goes through it almost intact. Starch is able to retain a lot of hydration, which in turn improves the movement.\n\nFood is only as healthy as you make it. Highly processed food may contain stuff that is potentially harmful, and lack very important stuff. Food high in suggars and fat almost always lacks in some important factors, such as vitamins, minerals, important aminoacids (protein building blocks), and many other substances we might need. We do need sugar and fats to survive, but our body cannot make everything it needs out of them, either easily or at all.\n\nWhen people say eat food high in fiber they almost always recommend starchy foods with very little processing done (cereal and the like) or vegetables, which is preferred, as they contain many vitamins, minerals and precursors we don't get from animal meat. Increasing your intake of vegetables will lead to a decrease of intake in highly processed food, which will also improve your overall blood sugar, collesterol, triglycerides, etc.\n\nBear in mind: the dose makes the poison. You can still eat highly processed food in smaller portions and balance it with healthier food. There's nothing wrong with having something as a treat or a pick me up; the issue begins when it becomes a very common thing.",

Fibre gets turned by your gut bacteria into all sorts of things, some of which have been shown to be good for health.\n3. The influence a bad diet has on cholesterol is a big worry because high cholesterol is linked to heart problems. Fibre creates a sticky gel in your intestines. Your liver uses cholesterol to make bile. That bile squirts into your intestines when you eat. It gets stuck in the gel and you poop it out. Your liver then has to pull cholesterol out of your blood to replace it - eat enough fibre, and you can very quickly drop your cholesterol by quite a lot.\n4. Fibre fills you up, so you might eat less calories from the unhealthy food.\n5. Fibre comes from vegetables and fruits, which are full of all kinds of healthful minerals and vitamins and compounds. A high fibre diet must include a lot of veggies and so, be healthy because of that. \"Unhealthy\" foods usually don't have much by way of naturally-occurring micronutrients, and there's not a lot fibre can do about that!",

Therefore it's only right to claim that SCFA administration has that effect.\n\nFurthermore, the section in the paper dealing with cortisol is titled: \n\n\"**Colonic delivery of SCFAs attenuates the cortisol, but not subjective, response to acute psychosocial stress**\" - Meaning \"*It doesn't make you less actually stressed but this biomarker went down when we measured it*\"\n\nFurther to that, please look at [Figure 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7784980/figure/Fig1/). Yes, their claim that SCFA administration causes a greater decrease in cortisol is true but it's patently clear their two intervention groups had greater cortisol responses to begin with. Also remember that data is transformed so it can't be said that \"intervention decreases cortisol by Y ng/ml\". Also the [intra-patient variability in salivary cortisol is extremely high](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/cclm-2024-0196/html) so I have my doubts as to whether 17 people is sufficiently powered to actually observe a change.\n\nThe diminished response is also only true for 17 of the 22 people per group in the study, because they deliberately excluded all the people that didn't have a cortisol response. It's also only true of men because they deliberately excluded women because their HPA axes are different to mens.\n\n**TLDR**: Fibre is wonderful, but that paper doesn't support the statement \"Not eating fibre releases cortisol and makes you stressed\"",
