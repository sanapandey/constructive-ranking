That\u2019s where if you have an infinitely large set of numbers, is it possible to come up with some system to number them, and what would that system be.\n\nFor Hilbert\u2019s Hotel, the guests are the infinitely large set and the hotel rooms are the numbers you\u2019re trying to assign to them. The question isn\u2019t \u201ccan you fit everyone\u201d it\u2019s \u201ccan you figure out what room number everyone should have. For the case of the single bus with infinite guests, if a guest comes up to you and says \u201cI\u2019m passenger 122 from the bus\u201d, you can say \u201cyou\u2019re in room 243\u201d, and you can prove that no one else will be in that room. If someone comes up and says \u201cI\u2019m guest 51 from the hotel\u201d you can say \u201cyou\u2019re now in room 102, and you can prove that no one else is in that room.\u00a0\n\nYou can\u2019t use the same method for an infinite number of buses. You need some system to determine which room guest 143 from bus 27 and guest 143 from bus 4,526 should be in.\u00a0\n\nEdit: clarification\u00a0",

So the current guests would go to rooms 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.\n\nFor the first bus with infinite people, for each infinite person on that bus *n*, put them in room 3^n, e.g. rooms 3, 9, 27, etc.\n\nFor the second bus of with infinite people, for each infinite person on that bus *m*, put them in room 5^m, e.g. rooms 5, 25, 125, etc.\n\nKeep repeating this process for infinite buses with infinite people, with each bus getting assigned the next prime number (eg. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc).\n\nThat's the difference with the 2n solution - the 2n solution will only let you assign rooms with one bus with infinite people. The prime power method lets you assign infinite rooms to infinite buses of infinite people.",

Although cardinal arithemetic requires you to assume the axiom of choice, but I digress.\n\nThe point of the thought experiment, specifically the \"countably infinite number of busses each with a countably infinite number of passengers show up\" scenaior is how do you *demonstrate* that truth (that c \u00d7 c = c for some countable infinite cardinal c) using your hotel? To do that, you need to demonstrate a bijection, a one-to-one-mapping.\n\nThe n -> 2n mapping only demonstrates a way to make space for a single busload of (countably) infinite passengers. It doesn't go to show that it works for the (countably) infinite number of busses.\n\nAlthough in the end 2c = c^2 = c, and they really are as you say the same (for any infinite cardinal c really), you need to *demonstrate* it. And the n -> 2n mapping by itself doesn't do that.",

Infinity is a concept, true, but it can also be a number in the sense that infinite cardinals and ordinals are \"numbers\"\u2014they may not be *natural* or *integers* or *real* numbers, but they are numbers in various well-defined and conssitent number systems, e.g., the surreals.\n\nCardinal arithmetic works perfectly fine and consistently for infinite cardinals, and they correspond perfectly to how you would expect them to behave based on set theory, although you need to assume the axiom of choice to define cardinal arithemetic.\n\nIf X and Y are sets (finite or infinite, countable or uncountable), and x = |X| and y = |Y| are their sizes:\n\n- x + y = |X| + |Y| = |X \u222a Y| = max(x, y), assuming X and Y are disjoint\n- x \u00d7 y = |X| \u00d7 |Y| = |X \u00d7 Y| = max(x, y)\n- x^y = |X|^(|Y|) = |{the set of all functions from X -> Y}|\n  - A famous example of this is 2^y = |P(Y)|, where P is the power set function.\n  - This likewise goes to show that x^n = x for any infinite cardinal x and any finite n, which is exactly the point of Hilbert's \"infinite number of busses showing up,\" which corresponds to x^2.\n\nAnd so on and so forth. It behaves exactly like you'd expect.",

They think that \"there's twice as many integers as evens\" is wrong.\n\nBoth those groups are making their mistake by intiutively assuming some properties that are not true.\n\nWhat's going on is that both \"cardinality of integers and evens is the same\" and \"cardinality of integers is twice the cardinality of evens\" is correct.

I can then ask the question: Where will the person who was in Room 1 be after this is over?\n\nWell, after the first bus was unloaded, they were moved to room 2. After the 2nd bus, they were in room 4. After the 3rd bus, they were in room 8. And so on. Because the hotel - presumably - has successfully accommodated everyone, this person must end up in *some* room at the end. Say that they're in room N. But, their room number keeps going up exponentially and so - eventually - their room number will surpass N and never come back down. We must conclude that they are *not* booked at the hotel anymore, even though they have had a room at every step. In fact, there's nothing special about this person, this is true for EVERY guest. If we repeatedly do the 2n method, then the hotel is empty at the end! (This is another famous paradox known as the [Ross-Littlewood Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross%E2%80%93Littlewood_paradox) and has to do with \"[Supertasks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffUnNaQTfZE)\".)\n\nOne key issue here is that we never are able to say that \"This Guest *ends up* in This Room\". However, with the prime method, I know immediately exactly where everyone is going to end up. The 500th person in the 3129th bus? They're in room 2^(500)\\*3^(3129).\n\nWhen constructing assignments, we need to be careful because wild things can happen when you start counting.",

Now everyone has an assigned room number with no repeats. If you have 3 busses, then you are in rooms 3N, 3N-1, 3N-2, and so on.\n\nWhen you have an infinite number of busses show up, the same trick doesn't work. What room does the person who was originally in room 1 go to? You need to give them a specific room number, but no matter what number, there's at least that many busses showing up.\n\nThe prime factors solution works because it's a way of tying two pieces of information together that will never collide. If everyone has an existing Bus and Seat number (or Hotel and Room number, which we can keep distinct), then by moving into room 2^(x) * 3^(y), you can guarantee that nobody will be in the same room.
