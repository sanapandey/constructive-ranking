Not opening the door doesn't really do anything special except keeping heat in. Like others have said non sterile air is getting in and out so inside warm oven or in heating tray on counter same thing.",

There is no such thing as \u201csterile air\u201d outside of a hermetically sealed medical environment. It is an enclosed space, and therefore food safe. As far as germs and bacteria go, they will all be dead before the oven even finishes preheating the next time you use it (170 degrees F kills pretty much all pathogens). I guess the real question is do they mean holding food- keeping it at a food safe temperature or as a storage option - keeping it in an enclosed environment like a Tupperware container. Long story short- sure. Keep your food in an oven. Just take it out before you turn in on again.",

For the purposes of lasagna, you probably don't have a well fitting lid that's also oven safe.  \n\nBut let's say you do.  Even modern fridges wouldn't like a 350F dish being put in there. You're gonna have warm everything else because the fridge can't sufficiently cool things.   Since you have a reasonably airtight lid on it though, chilling it externally (let's say you have a blast chiller) the refrigerating it should buy you a bit of extra time. But because it's not hermetically sealed it won't be too much time.  I'm not sure I buy the \"twice the shelf life\".   \n\nTo expand on this, this is basically the concept of canning.   \nTake a food, put it in a sealed jar, cook it to a safe temperature, and your food is shelf stable.  But for anyone that does any sort of canning, they know that a can that doesn't seal properly is unsafe to store for long periods.",

Then you can wait for it to cool - and ideally it needs to happen fast, so that it doesn't stay warm for hours. \n\nAt the same time, lasagna shouldn't be especially dangerous, as it's cooked thoroughly.",

It's always got a shit-hot-cast-iron sear on it, so it's always cooked well for what it's supposed to be, and that's how I learned that rare isn't as good as it's cracked up to being, and well done is better than it's given credit for, and that a happy medium seems to be my current favorite.",

The canning process only uses heat at 180-250'F and basically kills all bacteria present...enough that canned food can be safe to eat years or even decades after canning if the can is properly made, sealed, and stored. Steven1989MREInfo has Youtube videos where he is literally eating canned foods from the Korean War (~75 years ago) and even older...and he does not get sick or die from it.\n\nIf the canning temperatures are not enough to kill all bacteria then the bacteria inside the can would multiply rapidly and the canned food would spoil and be unsafe within weeks.\n\nAn oven cooking food to 300-400'F would easily kill all bacteria present without making the food inedible.\n\nEdit: It doesn't have to actually heat the food to 300-400'F, as much lower temperatures over a longer period of time can still kill the bacteria.",

Low pH > pH neutral\n\nThat is the minimum internal cooking temperature to cook food to make it safe to eat - not the temperature at which food becomes inedible.\n\n125'F for steak, 145'F for pork, and 160'F for chicken are just the absolute minimum \"internal\" cooking temperatures. 125'F is the guideline to cook the internals of the steak to rare (eg. the minimum level of cooking). You can cook the internals of the steak to 145'F to get it medium or 165'F to get it well done or cook it at even higher temperatures with moist-heat cooking methods.\n\nSites like Americastestkitchen say depending on the cut of chicken, you can cook fattier cuts of chicken like dark meat until its internal temperature reaches 210'F before it starts to get stringy (so the outer temperatures may be even higher than this). [https://www.americastestkitchen.com/articles/3115-best-internal-temp-chicken-thighs-drumsticks](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/articles/3115-best-internal-temp-chicken-thighs-drumsticks)\n\nYou can cook steak well over 200'F with dry heat - it will still be perfectly edible but might be tough from being overcooked.\n\nYou can also cook steak/beef in moist-heat cooking in the 200s'F (eg. in a sauce or liquid) by first boiling and then simmering until it becomes tender and breaks down (eg. cooking with a dutch oven inside an oven). It will be very tender and perfectly edible.\n\nI have also tried steamed meats - this cooks meat to at least 212'F and is perfectly edible (and delicious). This is usually done on stove tops but you can achieve the steaming effect if you cook something in a pot with a lid in an oven (eg. dutch oven or all metal pot).\n\nEdit: I eat at Latino restaurants where they consistently overcook their steak to far past well done - it would be dry to eat as a solid steak by itself, but is still delicious when chopped up and mixed with sauce in a taco or burrito.",

The only issue is some dry-heat cooking styles at high heat make the food overcooked and not as palatable - which is not the same as making it inedible.\n\nIt is still edible - it is just less palatable - it doesn't taste good/as good.\n\n>I'd also say pointing to people canning meat improperly and risking botulism which is fatal isn't really a strong argument\n\nThere is a similar argument for cooking a steak rare or even medium. People cooking steak to rare are also risking dangerous or potentially fatal bacteria because 125'F is only the minimum recommended internal cooking temperature for these styles...but plenty of people still eat steaks rare. There is even a low level of risks with eating steak cooked to medium at 145'F. Samonella bacteria can survive temperatures into the 160s'F.\n\nThe risks of dangerous bacteria penetrating the internal muscle tissue of a beef steak is rare (so people eat steaks rare and medium all the time), and the risks of botulism spores contaminating meat and surviving cooking at around boiling temperature (and then multiplying afterwards) is also rare.",

In the modern day, it's a lot easier for companies to test and ensure the lining they are using is not one which will leech, or if it does is harmless overall. Whereas older cans, the lining could well contain potentially problematic substances.\n\nWorth noting however, that excepting for certain alarmist spots I saw, the acknowledgement seems to be that the amount leeched is extremely small and is really only particularly a concern if a large portion of your food intake comes from canned goods.",

It opens out, so super high pressure inside the oven should be able to push even something pretty heavy blocking the door.  The door \"wants\" to go the direction that pressure is pushing so it should just burp occasionally, and the door gap is a wide area so it doesn't need to open far to let a lot of pressure out.  The door is basically a pneumatic powered flappy actuator at that point.   (And it's probably an electric oven so you don't have to magically pump gas and oxygen to somehow make fire work in the air tight space...)\n\nBut because the oven door opens out, low pressure inside would be a different scenario if it was air-tight.  The door opens opposite the direction of the ambient pressure that would be pushing to door shut.  Sort of like how they engineer airplane doors to open into the airplane, so it's almost impossible to open them at altitude because you'd have to pull against the air pressure.  Since an oven door isn't normally as strong as an airplane door, it'd probably shatter and spray door debris all over your cooling sourdough the first time you tried to bake in an airtight oven.",

So if an oven were airtight and had a safety valve and the valve failed, then you've got a problem.\n\nPutting the idea of a safety valve aside, I imagine in an airtight design, the door would have some sort of locking mechanism so that the pressure inside doesn't force the door open, which would be inefficient as it would be letting out heat and potentially ruining your bake, and dangerous, potentially blasting hot air into the face of anyone who happened to be standing in front of the oven cooking on the range at that moment.",

Properly manufactured blow-off valves are toleranced to rupture *early*, never late. They're solid pieces of calibrated alloy, so there's nothing else to fail. The only way a blow off valve can fail to avert an overpressure is if it has been obstructed, and that takes deliberate effort. You'd have to go out of your way to cram rocks down a pipe or something. When's the last time you heard of somebody's water heater exploding?

Machines *far* more dangerous than an airtight kitchen oven are in daily industrial use all around you. They don't erupt like that anymore (in countries with inspectors anyway).",

The instant pot doesn't reach high enough pressure/temperature to do things like meat to actually sterilize.  That's why you can't can certain foods like meats in something like an instant pot.  You need a pressure canner capable of reaching I believe 15PSI. Instant Pot only reaches IIRC like 11 or 12 PSI.    \n\nBut replace instant pot with a device that does hit the proper pressure/temperature and can remain hermetically sealed? Yeah.  \n\nThat's basically the principle behind pressure canning.  Food goes in a jar, it gets heated to a certain temperature, and remains sealed after cooling.",

I remember looking this up ages ago during college in the OED. But of course with the English language, the more it's used incorrectly the more \"accepted\" it is as a correct form and eventually it becomes kind of useless as a word.

Its what pros use, at least I was told.\n- Take out grills, put them in your bathtub with a few inches of hot water and a dishwasher pod\n- Use a flat stiff scraper ideally plastic to scrape off all the hard stuff stuck on surfaces in the oven (typically on the bottom) then vaccuum or brush or wipe out all the loose stuff. Dont scrape off greasy gunk if using a vaccuum though IMO, that could mess with your filter.\n- Spray the Zep all over your oven (everywhere except directly on the burners), close it up and wait an hour. \n- Use a microfiber towel to wipe away all the gunk, you'll be shocked how little-to-no scrubbing will be needed. Wipe down everything on the inside with a wet paper towel just to remove any oven-cleaner residue.\n- Take grills out of the tub, wipe em down, scrub anything still stuck on. Can use steel wool if necessary. I prefer Scour Daddy pads. \n- Then put grills back in, oven should look good as new.\n\n(This comment was not sponsored by Zep)",

Basically, best by dates are a quality/flavor thing, it won\u2019t kill you if it\u2019s a few days past the best by date. Consuming chicken past the use by date, on the other hand, is probably a bad idea :-). And the USDA has some truly useful info on how safe various foods are for how long when refrigerated or frozen.
