I\u2019ve also seen people say that a common practice once companies are acquired by PE firms is that they sometimes \u201cstrip them for parts\u201d and then kind of let the companies die off. What is the logic behind that? ",

            "body": "What you're talking about is asset stripping, and while it does happen in the world of PE, it's only really one specific strategy and requires a situation wherein the PE fund identifies a company whose assets exceed the value of their shares. Joann's is not really an example of asset stripping.\n\nPE funds are usually not trying to kill off businesses deliberately. Most of the time, the ultimate goal is for the fund to acquire the business and exit at a later point at a higher valuation, hence generating profit for shareholders. They usually tend to exit through one of a few main ways:\n\na) They might sell to another PE fund\n\nb) They might sell to a larger company seeking to make a strategic acquisition\n\nc) They might execute an initial public offering or \"IPO\" where they list the company on a major stock exchange where members of the public can purchase shares\n\nThe problems with PE tend to lie in two main issues:\n\n**a) The manner in which they acquire companies.**\n\nPE funds often rely on leveraged buyouts or \"LBOs\". An LBO is simply a method of acquiring a company by borrowing the money to finance the acquisition. Unlike a conventional loan, where the borrower might guarantee the loan with their own assets, in an LBO, the loan is guaranteed against the assets of the company **being acquired**.\n\nIt's a bit like a mortgage where you put down a deposit (which becomes your equity in the house) and your mortgage is secured against the house itself.\n\n**The advantage** for PE funds is much like the key advantage of a mortgage. They get to finance a large acquisition without providing a significant amount of cash upfront.\n\n**The downside** of an LBO is that it burdens the acquired company with a significant amount of debt, which it must pay back over time. This is what happened with Joann's.\n\n**b) The short time horizon of PE funds**\n\nThe way PE funds work is that they raise funds from private and institutional investors which are then invested in a series of companies within the fund (usually structured as a limited partnership) for a fixed period. At the end of the fixed period, the investors will want their money back, hopefully with a significant profit. A typical PE fund investment period will run between 5 and 7 years.\n\nThis means that PE firms are heavily incentivised to rapidly increase cashflow within their portfolio companies, both to improve the book value of the companies and to pay down the debt from the acquisitions, enabling them to exit with a high valuation. This can create perverse incentives and strategies where the long-term financial health of the company is sacrificed for short-term profitability. \n\nPE firms may use a range of strategies to rapidly increase cashflow in the short term. Examples might be selling off all of a company's inventory to generate large amounts of cash prior to listing the company on a public stock exchange (which the company then has to buy back at a later point), or it might involve laying off large numbers of staff to reduce overheads, or it could involve \"lease-back\" agreements where the company is forced to sell off all of its real estate to generate cash, only to lease it back again (as happened with Red Lobster).\n\nThere are plenty of other criticisms to be made about PE, including various financing arrangements, fee extraction, artificial returns, so on and so forth. But these are the main two.",

PE manages to buy the company, inflate it's valuation in the short term at the cost of long-term viability, sell off their holdings, and leave the new owners holding the bag.\n\nJust look at what happened to Red Lobster: they got bought up by PE firm GGC, who sold off the land for a quick profit while having the restaurants lease it back from the new owners, which led to their eventual bankruptcy. Of course, GGC had already sold off Red Lobster by the time this happened, so they made a nice dime while an entire brand tanked. I don't know how the debt was structured in this case, but you can imagine if they'd passed it off to RL it seems like a way to rob the place and leave them with a bill for being robbed.",

Companies don't usually sell to PE unless they are going down. Maybe they're not laying anyone off or closing stores, but those steps are leading to the slow bleed out that the general public doesn't see. PE will then come in and cut stores and employees in an effort to keep the company as a whole afloat. Definitely sucks for those out of a job, but the alternative is the company going bankrupt and everyone getting laid off.",

The pension looting shifted retirement costs to government, so they were a form of legal and one-step-removed stealing from taxpayers. This was part of the wholesale shift of the US to a rent-seeking economy, where corporations would not invest in durable value (things that have value after they have been paid for - roads, supply chain, worker skills, etc.) and corporations would lobby the government to not invest in those things because they didn't want to pay the taxes to do that.",

Of course the people that were employed by the other 4 do not feel the same way.\n\nAnd just to be clear - I do think your description is generally how PE firms work.

The debt gets added to the company for tax shielding purposes (interest is deductible), as well as minimizing the equity capital at risk, and the company\u2019s profit pays for it.\n\nRemember they get 20% of the profit of the deal, and any debt is subtracted from the proceeds.

The PE will often acquire the building, land, or other assets from the company they purchased and, in exchange, the acquired company will receive liquidity which helps them survive. This doesn't fix their problems but it does give them more time to attempt a recovery. \n\nThey still have to pay FMV for the assets. If the company does enter bankruptcy, they will have to prove that any transaction between the PE and acquired company was at arm's length.

Also, I am hearing they are now keeping things longer on average. The model is to buy some companies, do stuff to hopefully make them worth more and then sell for a return.

It's an investment industry though so most aren't buying a company with the intention of destroying it. These firms are looking for ROI (return on investment). Business (not just businesses bought by private equity) often fail due to mismanagement, as such, it is possible for a private equity firm to mismanage an investment. You could argue that this was the case with Joann. The private equity firm that took on Joann extracted to much debt, cut staff in an attempt to cut cost, and also suffered inventory issues due to covid. It wasn't entirely the blame of the private equity group that caused the failure of Joann Fabrics though. It is a brick and mortar store and had already lost a significant amount of market share to online competitors.",

            "body": "Private Equity firms are interested in value, not businesses. PE firms aren\u2019t normally interested in holding a business they acquire on their books forever since they make money by buying businesses at a low price and selling them at a higher price. \n\nSome businesses have a successful business model that generates profit and PE firms acquire those businesses because they go on sale by the former owner (or perhaps by a hostile takeover by acquiring a controlling interest of stock in a publicly traded company). The PE, sort of like a business management consultant, may feel that they can make these successful companies even more efficient and maximize previously unrealized value. Then they can sell this more valuable company for more money to someone else.\n\nPE firms may have another expertise involving failing businesses like JoAnne \u2018s. I don\u2019t pretend to know much about JoAnne\u2019s, but I assume that their costs have gone up in recent years due to their supply chain and they owned too many physical locations that weren\u2019t generating enough sales. As a result, the company likely accumulated massive debt.\n\nWhen a PE firm acquires a business like this, they aren\u2019t going to put in the years of work to fix the business model and make it profitable again. Instead, they will look over all the assets of the company and sell them. They will call other companies that are experts in store closings and have them liquidate the company\u2019s inventory. They will fire all the employees during this period, essentially offering fewer and fewer of them to hold their jobs until the stores can be closed. They will see if they can sell the brand or intellectual property of the business like what happened with Bed, Bath and Beyond. Some businesses have subsidies, real estate, or patents that are valuable that can often be sold. Basically, as a process of buying a failing company, the PE firm is going through their books to see if they think they can make money by buying it and then liquidating it.\n\nOften, especially if they know how to leverage and restructure debt well, PE firms can make lots of profit by liquidating companies. In fact, it can create a perverse incentive where PE firms might acquire a healthy and successful business and they liquidate it anyway (putting the employees out of work). There are lots of movies with this as is part of the plot like \u201cWall Street\u201d and \u201cOther People\u2019s Money.\u201d This can also be a similar mechanism that some larger companies will use to acquire smaller competitors to put them out of business. Unless a company is mostly owned by individuals that are determined to sell the business to another party that wants to keep it going, then there is always the risk that selling to someone else might result in liquidation.\n\nIn the movie \u201cWall Street\u201d Micheal Douglas\u2019 character Gordon Gecko famously has a speech often called \u201cgreed is good.\u201d The speech is delivered to a shareholder\u2019s meeting of a small airline company that is making small annual profits. Gecko is offering the shareholders more money if they will go along with his plan to kill the company under the argument that business is only about profit and no other moral responsibility, thus greed is the only true \u201cgood\u201d of business.\n\nThis mentality is precisely why so many PE firms have a bad reputation. You might also remember Mitt Romney was part owner of Bain Capital which he often pointed to as saving jobs but also liquidated many companies resulting in thousands of people losing their jobs. Fundamentally, PE firm only care about value and selling business for more than they paid for them. If how they get there is always moral or not is in the eye of the beholder.",

            "body": "Private equity is a large class of business. So first you need to break them down into different types. Not every type does what you're describing so your thinking is a bit superficial. Private equity simply refers to companies that invest in companies with the aim of taking a major stake and sometimes to control a company. In extreme cases, private equity firms buy the company up completely.\n\na) Venture Capital - This kind of private equity that focuses on companies early in their life cycle. Very often before the company is publicly listed. Their aim is to provide capital and expertise to allow the company to grow quickly and profit when the company goes public.\n\nb) Value based capital firms - This kind of private equity looks for firms that are, in their opinion, undervalued. By taking a stake in the firm, they want to influence the company direction and strategy in the hopes that the company can realize that potential. They profit by making the company more valuable and then selling their stake off later. In this process the PE firm might require the company to sell off or shut down unprofitable business units. So this can be ultimately beneficial to company but it can be very chaotic to their employees.\n\nc) \"vulture\" capital firms - This kind of private equity looks for distressed firms who are doing very badly but who might hold valuable assets. For example a firm that might have poor operating business but owns a lot of real estate or perhaps holds valuable IP (patents etc). Here the private equity firm might not be interested in reviving the company as an operating business. Instead it might try to liquidate the company, essentially fire all the employees and sell the underlying assets in the hopes of making a profit. This could be the type of firm you are referring to and why the operate that way.\n\nThis is just a broad overview of PE and how they have different goals and approaches.",

That\u2019s usually a consequence of the PE firm doing a shit job.\n\nThe basic idea is, they\u2019ll buy a company with leverage, hold the business for a few years as it grows, then sell the business for more and use the proceeds to pay off the debt and the remainder of the money goes to themselves.\u00a0\n\nThis concept of \u201cPE firms just strip companies for parts\u201d isn\u2019t that common anymore. In the past, valuations were pretty inefficient and there was a huge trend of conglomerate businesses that did a shit ton of different business activities. \u201cCorporate raiders\u201d realized they could spin these off into seperate businesses, with the sum of the parts being worth more than the overly convoluted whole. If you have a business which both has a fast growth software segment and a mature manufacturing arm, people either wanna buy the software arm or the stable industrials arm - as a conglomerate, these businesses suffered from a \u201cconglomerate exposure\u201d as neither type of investor wanted exposure to BOTH kinds of segments.\u00a0\n\nThese inefficiencies have mostly dissipated. This is simply not a common PE strategy anymore; however, activists still push for spin-offs in the public markets. Instead, in PE, the more popular strategy over the last few years has been the roll up strategy (literally the opposite of stripping apart assets). For example, a PE firm might buy a platform HVAC business for 10x EBITDA, and buy smaller HVAC businesses at 7x EBITDA - this results in instant multiples arbritage. The issue is, a lot of PE firms didn\u2019t integrate the rollup acquisitions well, and funded the rollups through copious amounts of debt, so when shit doesn\u2019t work / hits the fan, the portfolio company goes into bankruptcy.\n\nIf a PE firm\u2019s portfolio company goes into bankruptcy, the PE firm takes a massive loss. However, a lot of people confuse a bunch of these concepts and come to the conclusion that driving the firm into bankruptcy benefits the PE firm. That is the exception rather than the norm.\u00a0",

The owner has it on the market for $50,000. You buy it, but you actually take out a loan against the ice cream shop (your own name isn't on the loan) for 80% of the amount. So, you only had to put up $10,000 in cash. Then you cut everyone's pay, raise the price of ice cream alienating all the customers, cut every benefit to rake in some short term profits, and start selling off all the equipment. The ice cream shop goes out of business in 3 months, and everyone working there is laid off. However, you managed to take in about $20,000 during that time cannibalizing the business. The business goes under, and the bank repossesses what is left. The loan was in the name of the business, so you are unaffected. Then you go and do it with another business, and another, and another. You are double your investment every time in a very short period of time. So, you are happy. This is great money, but you leave a wake of destroyed businesses behind you.\n\nA good example of this happening in the real world was Toys'r'us. This is exactly what happened to them. \n\nThis is a simplified example. You wouldn't actually be able to do what I described because nobody would take out a loan against the business. They would require your personal guarantee on it. However in the world of private equity, they make it work.",

            "body": "Something many comments are missing is that buying an undervalued company (ie the assets are worth more on paper than what you paid) allows the business to raise significant debt using the bought businesses assets as security. This debt can then be used on riskier ventures and if they don't work out it's covered by the assets used as security.\n\nSo, basic numbers. A business worth 1m is bought by private equity for 800k. The 1m worth of business assets are used to secure 2m debt to be repaid over a long time frame. The 2m is used for risky investments. If they work out then the profits are returned to the private equity firm. If they fail then the business is unable to service the interest, defaults on the loans and it is up to the lender to try get their money back by selling the assets used as security.\n\n(I'm not an expert on this so the numbers might be a bit wrong, please correct me if they are. I'm not exactly sure how much they can borrow as a multiple of assets) \n\nIt is kind of similar to what happened with mortgages in 2008~. On paper these loans to established businesses aren't classed as particularly high risk, especially because they've got the security of real assets. But in practise they're very high risk loans because of what the money is being used for and how inconsequential it is for the private equity firm if they can't repay it.",

It's not always possible to do, because companies are usually designed to make more money by continuing to operate, but there are isolated cases that some people are good at identifying, where there's some asset in the company that happens to be worth more today than the share price. \n\nThis is partly because the stock market is an emotional beast, and good companies get overvalued and bad companies get undervalued. If you're losing money, maybe nobody wants your shares, so they drift downward in price even though you have lots of cash or real estate or whatever. It might even be a fair evaluation of the business, because a money losing operation with cash in the bank technically is worth less than just the cash. At some point the market cap can drop to less than the total value of those assets, which isn't an event horizon most traders notice, and at that point a hostile takeover becomes a real possibility.",

A consequence of that might be the death of the company, depending on what their strategy is and how successful they are. Acquisitions like this aren't passive (buying it, doing nothing, and letting it die) they're usually extremely active. \n\nPeople make the mistake of thinking capitalism works the way we teach it in schools. You produce goods/services that people want, they purchase them, you make a profit. That, however, is as simplistic as thinking all of genetics works like a simple Punnett Square or one gene controlling every trait. It's what we teach children to help introduce them to a complex topic. PE funds are after a profit, but not by selling anything to the public. They either want to sell off the assets and close the company down (what most people think of, but not usually what actually happens) or juice the stock price so they can resell it.\n\nThe stock market is far more \"emotional\" than we like to acknowledge. You want a stock's price to be determined by its business position and promise for future returns, but humans evaluate the likelihood and size of those returns. Convince enough people with enough money that the company will be wildly successful sometime in the future and you can spark a cycle of buying and price increases. Other people see the price going up, and they jump on the bandwagon. If your promises are convincing enough, you can keep this cycle going for a long time. That's Elon Musk's whole business model - wild sci-fi promises, stock price goes up, and every earnings report make the next wild promise. As long as you can keep people believing you, you don't have to actually deliver results. The hype is the result.\n\nFor PE, the goal is usually to convince someone else to buy, by hook or by crook. That might mean legitimately turning the company around with solid business acumen. But that takes time - time when their money is invested in this company instead of others. Time is money. The faster they can flip, the more times they can do it and the more money they can make. So often the strategy is to take wild short term risks that will probably kill the company (in which case you recoup as much as you can selling the assets). But sometimes they manage to sell the risk to other investors as a revolutionary business move that will send the company soaring. They don't need to pull it off, just convince other people that they *could.* Since the upside is massive and the downside is capped at the amount invested minus asset value, they only need it to work a small percentage of the time to make lots of money. It means lots of companies get killed, but a couple of survivors cover the losses and then some.\n\nWhen you see a PE firm buying a company and think they're making crazy decisions, you're not entirely wrong. It will probably kill the company. But they're not trying to make a successful company, they're trying to make the price go up, which is more about marketing to other investors than business fundamentals.",

Rather than run it into the ground put all the employees out of work and leave themselves with nothing, selling the business gives it a chance of a positive outcome.\n\nIn very broad strokes, the value of a business can be roughly calculated as the sum of:\n\n1. Estimated value of physical assets (e.g. land, equipment)\n\n2. Estimated value of intellectual property (e.g. patents, trademarks, copyrights)\n\n3. Debts (negative)\n\n4. Projected revenue over next few years\n\n5. Projected costs over next few years (negative)\n\nNotice how most of those are estimates and projections. These are subject to a lot of interpretation, and the value to one buyer might be different for another buyer, and that's where PE firms tend to specialize. \n\nPE firms bid on and buy failing companies when their estimation of the company's value is higher than the asking price.\n\nHere's an example:\nIf I owned a machine shop in a small city that was going under and I wanted to liquidate the business and sell all of my equipment, I might have trouble doing that. The shop down the road might need a lathe and milling machine. But I have 20 machines I need to sell, and there's not much local demand for the equipment, so I'm not going to get a good price. I might be able to scrounge $40,000 for my equipment.\n\nA PE firm reviews my asset list and sees a lot more potential. They are much better equipped to liquidate that equipment. At the bare minimum, they might be able to toss it all on a few trucks and ship it to a warehouse they own where they can catalogue it and list it for sale. Because their storage costs are very low, they can afford to wait for a buyer at a higher price. They may also be able to leverage their shipping networks to move the machines cross-country or internationally to reach more customers. They might be able to sell the same assets for better prices, perhaps $100,000. This is one reason a PE firm might be interested in buying my company.\n\nWhen a PE firm is looking at buying a company, they first look at the expected value of the company if they liquidated everything. When they get farther into purchase negotiations or even after they've purchased, they bring in some of their specialists and try to determine if the company can become profitable enough to justify not stripping it, and what actions may need to be taken in order to accomplish that.\n\nThey will often be ruthless in the process of turning the company around. They bring in new management, manufacturing & engineering specialists, etc. They're often refreshingly up-front with the employees about the state of the company as well, because they need experienced employees to buy-in and work with them on the change. \n\nIf the company isn't worth trying to turn around, or their efforts aren't successful enough, then they close up shop and liquidate the company's assets. They sell physical property, often to other companies that they own and manage. They sell intellectual property rights to other companies under their umbrella. They then sell the land to a third party, OR to another company they manage that's looking to expand. They're very efficient at the whole process.\n\nAs much as PE firms can be very damaging to the employees of the businesses they strip, often those businesses were on their way down anyways. The PE firms are just making a clean cut to keep the books in the black.\n\nTwo shortfalls to PE firms are that they don't understand small niche markets very well, and they don't appreciate business stability.\n\nThey can end up stripping down businesses that had unrealized potential in their niche market, and they can end up stripping down businesses that were not wildly profitable, but were reliable.\n\nPE firms simply see \"How much can I make right now, and if I had that much, how much can that money help me make tomorrow if I invest it elsewhere?\"",

Mostly due to their business not going well, but still owning valuable assets.\n\nThen they buy them out and strip mine them for all the profitable parts. Like real estate, IP, patents, profitable subdivisions,...\n\nThey sell all these parts for profit and what's left is the husk nobody wants. Then they let the company die after extracting all the value out of it.\n\nJust to be sure this is just one of the options they have. Sometimes they still see potential in the company and so just replace the management team (C-Suit) and try to turn the business around, before selling it again. But that's more of an long term investment, which is more risky on their part.\n\nSo when the stock price is low enough striping company for parts is an easy way to make a quick buck for Private equity.",

In the name of cost cutting, cancel all R&D, reduce maintenance to the absolute minimum, fire all the experienced and well paid staff, buy cheaper supplies and switch to less reliable vendors, sell of all inventory at low prices and get rid of warehouses in the name of just-in-time.\n1. This will make it appear as if the business has been turned around. On paper costs are down and profits are up.\n1. Then you sell the business for more than you originally paid for.\n1. Profit!\n1. The business itself will be ruined, because now it has no future.\n\nAnother method might be:\n\n1. Buy a business\n2. Put the debt that you incurred buying it into the business itself. In effect buying it with its own money.\n3. Sell assets like the buildings and real estate the company has to later rent it back.\n4. Spin off successful parts of the company and sell those off too.\n5. Take all the profits you made selling off the companies assets and pay it to the shareholders as dividends or stock buybacks.\n6. Profit!\n7. Leave the company now bereft of its most profitable parts, saddled with the debt of its own acquisition and bleeding money renting and leasing assets it used to own.\n\nThere is more and you can combine parts",

            "body": "Instead of a company and profits, think about a teen and fun. Now consider what it takes to be good friends vs good parents as that is the difference between private equity firms vs long term investors. Raising a teenager with the goal of becoming a responsible adult with good values, it's a lot harder to be a good parent.\n\nChoices parents need to make are a lot harder, they have to consider the immediate effects and balance that with future goals. Being a \"good\" friend is much simpler. They only need to consider the immediate. Going to a party instead of studying for a test next week is going to seem like more fun--until next week.\n\nRelating that back, private equity firms will buy a controlling interest in a company. \"Stripping them for parts\" is taking the most valuable assets and selling it off, or lowering costs (like downsizing the company's workforce), regardless of how that might impact the future of the company.\n\nA notable example is Red Lobster, where a private equity firm acquired the seafood chain, sold the real estate under the restaurants worth about 1.5 billion to another company it controlled, and leased it back to Red Lobster. The high rent costs crippled the restaurants' ability to operate profitably. Red Lobster may go bankrupt but the private equity has benefitted greatly: they were paid out dividends from the real estate sale, and can generate income from the newly acquired real estate either from Red Lobster (or the next renters). This strategy a net positive to the investors of the private equity firm while Red Lobster was pushed towards bankruptcy.",
