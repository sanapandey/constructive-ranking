Division is a long process and difficult. So it takes time to check every number.\n\nThe prime number theorem states that the number of primes less than N tends to N/logN . When we are talking about 41 million-digit numbers, it means about 1/10million numbers are prime.\n\nUsing some very clever number theory, there are much quicker ways to find if a number is prime if it is in the form 2\\^(p) - 1 where p is prime. These are called Mersenne primes. All the recent largest primes are of this form. The checks don't require knowing all primes less than the number, allowing many computers to search together.\n\nSo instead of going through all 41 million-digit numbers, they just check all the numbers of the form 2\\^(p) - 1. And the largest known prime is 2\\^136,279,841 - 1. So they only had to check up to 136,279,841 numbers if they're prime.",

And to know if a number n is prime, you have to try and divide it with all the first primes from 2 to sqrt(n).

Most programming languages have a well-established library for dealing with arbitrarily large integers (well, ones that are small enough to fit in the RAM).\n\n> Computers have a reputation for being precise, but there\u2019s actually quite a lot of rounding and approximation, especially when it comes to numbers that are very big, very small, and/or have a lot of digits.\n\nTypically, integer operations are exact. Some programming languages will automatically switch over to floating-point arithmetic (which has rounding errors) if integers get too big, but others give you errors or wrap around to 0. Some have a big-integer library built in and will automatically use it if necessary. Look at this from Python, for example:\n\n    >>> 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000-1\n    999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999\n    >>> 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.0-1.0\n    1e+60\n\n>  So a computer might have numbers precise up to 10 digits or so\n\nIt's usually about 16 decimal places.",
