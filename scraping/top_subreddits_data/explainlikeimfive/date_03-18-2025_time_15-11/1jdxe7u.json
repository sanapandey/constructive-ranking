From some quick Google searches, I can see that a cup of whole milk has about 150 calories. About 70 of those are fat, about 30 are protein, and about 50 are lactose. The ratios can be different depending on the dairy product, but there will always be some number of calories that even a lactose intolerant person will be able to absorb.",
