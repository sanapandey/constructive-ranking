(I don\u2019t know the brand)\n\nIt claims it is monitoring your blood pressure. And your blood sugar\u2026. \n\n\nHow in the heck can it possibly know your blood pressure?? How does it know your blood sugar without a blood sample??  \n\n\nMy dad has a friend who was wearing such a watch. She kept trying to get it to read her blood sugar and it kept telling her \u201csomething is wrong; see a doctor\u201d and when she did, both she and her doctor were shocked to find she has leukemia (she had had no symptoms prior to this) HOW???? \n\n\nI am a paramedic, so I understand medical things. I don\u2019t understand technology or technological terms. ",

Then sensors create a spectrogram of how much oxygen in your blood, how thick is your skin etc. Microcontroller inside the smart watch then does some calculation and estimate a value. \n\nAs far as i know non-invasive glucose monitoring is not a thing nowadays. There some ongoing research about it though.",

There's a reason why people with diabetes use things like Dexcom monitors!\n\nWhat I will say though is that I have had a few patients come to me saying that their watch had detected abnormal heart rhythms, who have turned out to have atrial fibrillation. For those non medical - this is a particular kind of abnormal heart rhythm which can lead to increased risk of stroke, so it's quite important to detect. Smart watches seem reasonably reliable with detecting pulse rate, and therefore can detect the arrhythmia. I think some are even FDA approved for this.",

It might be just because you've not quite clicked the fuel cap closed properly, it might be because you've got something horribly wrong that's going to cost you a fortune, but the warning lamp is telling you to go see your mechanic. Or, your watch is saying to go see your doctor.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso worth pointing out that this article from the American College of Cardiology seems to think that smart watches are pretty damn effective. \n\nhttps://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Articles/2024/05/29/16/56/Smartwatches-and-Atrial-Fibrillation",

            "body": "How to sense glucose. Every chemical has something called a spectrum. Spectrum is basically the response of a material to light. Colorful things are colorful exactly because this is their response to visible light. If we extend our understanding of light to all kinds of electromagnetic radiation, we see that the spectrum (i.e. the specific response) of the material. Some materials have a very distinct response to UV light, others have response to infrared light.        \n\nThere are a number of attempts to sense glucose but the common idea behind all of them is to sense the spectrum of glucose. In short, the sensor sends some sort of light (light, in wide sense) into the skin and measures the response. It's kind of like the \"color\" of glucose except not in visible light. But the idea is the same as using a flashlight as a light source and our eyes as a sensor to decide if a glass of water has blue color mixed in, and is it only a little blue or very blue.      \n\nJust, instead of \"blue\", the \"color\" of our blood is based on glucose levels.      \n\nNow the sad thing is that glucose doesn't have a very characteristics spectrum (or, \"quasi color\"), because other molecules overlap with it. So it requires a lot of tweaking with the light source and the sensor until something valuable can be gained out of it. It's likely that your case, the leukemia caused the blood composition to be so out of calibration range that the watch could not understand it.      \n\nI don't know how optical blood pressure works but it somehow can figure out the tension of capillaries using how the light scatters.",

That is simply leveraging the lay person's experience with portable oximeters to convince them glucose monitoring could be done.  It might be--but not in a consumer product yet.\n\nThe method being researched involves shining a light through the skin, then using a sensor to detect the absence of wavelengths (usually in the IR region) associated with glucose.
