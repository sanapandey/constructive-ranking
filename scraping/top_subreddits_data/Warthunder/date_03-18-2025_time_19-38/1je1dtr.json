I know you didn\u2019t mention it but still worth a mention that a 183mm Hesh performs worse against armor then smaller HE rounds. \n\nDon\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever hear anyone call the Olifant op. As it\u2019s a centurion at like 8.7 at the end of the day.\n\nPremium Rooi is still really good. Tech tree one with the 76 is just a dice roll on if it does any damage post pen. The MTTD is good. \n\nChallenger 2s are all terribly modeled and have things wrong with them that hurt the vehicle a lot. Good tanks. I say they\u2019re off Meta. \n\nBISHMA is quite mid, as imo I\u2019d rather use the Chally Mark3, or the Vickers. Reverse gears are helpful to have. \n\nFirefly\u2019s and Avenger are really good. \n\nAnd yes they got a slightly better version of the EF then Germany. Yet it\u2019s radar is bugged. And has been for three months. Good thing they nerfed the flight model before fixing its radar. \n\nI fox3 harriers are all new airframes except the British one. Making it way worse. Can\u2019t go down though because of compression. \n\nBritain also could have gotten two different F18s this update and instead got a premium harrier worse then the American one. For their one air vehicle of the update. \n\nThe spitfires are great. Love them.\n\nI could go on, theres plenty of tanks that are good, and then theres a decent chunk of tanks Gaijin refuses to fix. LOOKING AT YOU TES. Made a fucking dev blog about how it was right even though anyone with a brian can see that it isn't. Like common sense says the 3x as big ERA blocks would protect from more kenetic damage then the smaller ones. Yet its a flat 30mm accross like three different types of ERA.",
