There's actually people who spend thousands and thousands of dollars on this game, and other games.\n\n\n\nOfcourse doesn't mean that everyone who bought this is a whale, but there's also people who are more conservative with their spending, but not to the point where they don't mind spending $70 on a vehicle.\n\n\nSure if you want to grind Italy you could start with the pzh2000, or the OF-40, but most of these people probably just buy whatever is the highest tier.\n\n\nThere is also the centauro, which I'm sure a decent amount of people bought too. But even though the ariete has bad armor for an MBT, you're generally probably better off in an MBT compared to the paper thin armor of the centauro.\n\n\nSo this drops and people buy it. Some may buy it to have an extra vehicle to play along the centauro they had already bought.",
