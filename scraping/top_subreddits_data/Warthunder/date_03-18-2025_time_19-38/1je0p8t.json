Any items of the specified types can be recycled in the \u201cItem Recycling\u201d tab in the Inventory. Players can create new, random items from them in the ratio of 2:1. There is also a small chance when creating an item to get 500,000 or 1 million Silver Lions instead of an item.\n* In Naval Battles, the reward in Silver Lions and Research Points for destroying AI-controlled ships (both \u201cnamed\u201d bots and mission AI) has been increased to the level of the reward for players. AI-controlled ships in Naval Battles do not differ much in their combat efficiency from players, and the reward for damaging them (the main source of income in Naval Battles) was already equal to the reward for damaging players. Therefore, now the rewards for damage and destruction (finishing off the target) will not depend on who controls the target ship \u2014 a player or an AI.\n\n  \nI like these changes!",

Now, the required lead value is generated automatically, taking into account the parameters of the player\u2019s ship and the target ship\u2019s movement. When aiming at the desired part of an enemy ship, the gunners will independently determine these parameters and take the required lead. In addition to reducing the chance of an aiming error, this change makes shooting at long distances (and especially on opposite courses) better, as the target will no longer be outside of the player\u2019s field of view. In addition to this, the shell impact point marker and the FCS calculation update progress bar have been disabled in AB, since with the new aiming system, these elements are no longer necessary.\n\nFUCK\n\n* The hulls of ships have had their strength mechanic returned, expanded and redesigned. All other methods of destroying an enemy remain the same, with the addition of a way to destroy its hull to such an extent that unsinkability is lost\n\n**FUCK**\n\nTHEY REALLY PUSHED THAT THROUGH DESPITE 95% OF PLAYERS VOTING NO??",

(Five new if we include *Kirov* being added to KC just over a week ago!)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Td8rHqcwfi77VGdwkGZAhD-enQGkNbEA99CTii35PS4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> The following locations have received visual rework: Sinai / Jungle / Advance to the Rhine\n\n> Pz.38(t) (all variants) \u2014 turret rotation speed has been increased from 14\u00b0/s to 25\u00b0/s.\n\n> Ju 87 D-3 \u2014 the SC1800 bomb has been added.\n\n> The dispersion parameters of most guns with a caliber of 100 mm and higher have been corrected.\n\n> Kinetic armor penetration has been added to high-explosive shells that are 20 mm caliber or higher. These shells will be able to penetrate thin armor due to their energy and explode inside with a delay of 0.001 s, which will make high-explosive shells more effective in hitting poorly protected targets.\n\n> Torpedoes and mines now have the effect of hydraulic shock on ship hulls.\n\n> Control over hit result icons has been added to the settings. You can choose which ones to display or turn them all off.\n\n> The ability to recycle inventory items\n\n> The old reserves will be available for obtaining upon purchasing the first vessel of rank II.\n\n> HMS Churchill \u2014 is now available upon purchasing the first British bluewater vessel of rank II.\n\nSome very welcome highlights here! I'm especially looking forward to the ship accuracy buff, and it's always good to see stuff made obtainable rather than removed! :)\n\nThe ship hull sections thing is still dumb, but it seems they've nerfed it enough that it shouldn't really matter.",

            "body": "Cool update. First the Tiger UHT get copy pasted into the French tree making germany even less unique and now the Eurofighter basically flies like a WW2 bomber with more trust. Turning off the aoa limiter doesnt do anything you still hard locked at 12G your controls will just stop working and the aircraft stops pulling any G's, that turnrate even at low speed is ridiculous and I'm pretty sure this is either bugged or they lost their minds and decided to just limit the Eurofighter and every other aircraft stays the same. You cant contest BVR anymore because you like 15% slower and the radar is still the same bugged mess like before taking about 2 minutes to give you any locks and the lock is constantly losing track.\n\nYou know what? Today is the day the game leaves my harddrive. I was alrdy not playing much anymore because of the KH-38 and after they decided to not give the EF FNF brimstones NOT EVEN 6 when every other dogshit 14.0 gets at least 6 FNF ordnance but now after completely ruining the aircraft in its ability to fly, I do not feel like playing this anymore. It was the aircraft I was waiting ever since I started grinding Germany like 6 years ago. Now its absolutely trashed based on what information? No aircraft can pull more than 12g most cant even pull 9 yet the Rafale and some other Aircrafts still pull 12+G? What are you on about.. Adjusting it sure but this? This feels like half the aircraft it was before..\n\nDon't you see what wrong with your game? The Pantsir is still the best AA in the game by far for literally 2 years now. TWO FUCKING YEARS. Its so broken compare to any other AA in the game, IT SHOULD HAVE ITS OWN TIER. Yet you add more and more weapons only the Pantsir could fight but you add it on the Russian Airframes leaving me with my FlaRakRad fighting 4 incoming ballistic missile.. You are out of your mind really you guys lost it. This selective balancing for certain countries is beyond cringe.\n\nThe game seems more like a debate on who is right or wrong than anything else nowadays. You should maybe but only maybe, in-between all these made up historical facts you pulled out your arse, consider to BALANCE the game.. Well HF everyone fighting the R77-1 and another KH-38 platform because 2 was not enough for Russia you need 3 unique aircraft with different spawnpoint multiplier because why not.",
