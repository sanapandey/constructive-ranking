Huge problems go unresolved for weeks while they flaunt the f-18 and the second it drops, it doesn\u2019t even work. But hey dont worry, in two month the next update will have EVEN MORE PREMIUMS. More bugs, less feedback, and probably going to compress everything above 11.0 all into one B.R. so you can face f-18s in your late cold war jet. Oh and buy premium for your account so you dont go broke getting spawn camped 10 games in a row.",

Just keep adding more shit, but not the shit we're asking for while making the game buggy by rushing out untested shit at increased prices for premium vehicles. If another game came out that offered a similar experience I'd uninstall. Too bad WoT is too arcade for me, IL2 is too simulator, and they don't have tanks and planes in the same game. My only option is War Thunder, and people with your thoughts that buy new $80 premium vehicles when they drop is the reason why this game would rather die than improve. What's the most requested vehicle? Add it next update, copy paste to half the nations. Repeat every few months.",
