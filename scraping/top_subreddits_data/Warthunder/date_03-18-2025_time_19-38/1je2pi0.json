So they were able to climb 30 degrees (which checks out with what I found online).\n\nThat being said 30 degrees is far more than what they\u2019re able to do in war thunder which I partially get because designing maps that factor in all the possible locations tanks could get you would be impossible and result in spots where 1 tank could hold down an entire portion of the map uncontested. But this is extreme and there\u2019s better ways to prevent people getting into spots they don\u2019t want abused.\n\n(Reference, the reason % incline is half of degrees incline, is because it\u2019s measured as how many meters increase vertically per 100m horizontally.)",
