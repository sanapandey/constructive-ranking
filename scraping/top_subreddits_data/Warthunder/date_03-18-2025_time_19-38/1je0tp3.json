There is not even a single picture of a real F-16AJ, because it never actually existed. The pictures in the actual General Dynamics F-16AJ promotional brochure (the literal only source of information on this aircraft) are either pictures of the YF-16, F-16As, and schematic drawings of a proposed F-16AJ.  \n\nThe 17 Japanese options included in the brochure for the AJ were just proposed modifications for the AJ **if it was built, which it wasn't**. The actual plane they flew was almost certainly just a regular F-16A, at most with minor modifications but certainly not a brand new variant of the aircraft.\n\n I would be surprised if you could show me legitimate proof that a real, honest-to-god F-16AJ existed. I've tried searching over past couple years in both English and Japanese and turned up empty handed.\n\nJapanese players were already confused when Gaijin originally announced the F-16AJ because they had never heard of it and couldn't find further information on its existence in any Japanese sources online. The argument for the F-16AJ was Gaijin deciding a paper-plane was better than no plane at all for Japan top-tier at the time, Gaijin literally said that themselves in their devblog for the AJ if you want to check for yourself. There's even recent comments on Japanese War Thunder wiki-like pages of people expecting Gaijin to eventually remove the F-16AJ, as it's an identical situation to the Keiun (R2Y2) with them pointing to alternatives like the Thai F-16, F-15JM, and eventually the F-2 as all being able to fill the hole the AJ was intended to plug as a stop-gap solution.",

Thats why its good at range, simply because missile doesn't loose much speed, but whwn it comes to turning, tha pantsir missile looses its power really quickly. I honestly think the problem with it isnt that its too strong, but with that it has this straight line range, that people are not used to defeating. VT-1 is for example slower and has less range, but the rocket motor lasts much longer so within this burn range, VT-1 is better.\n\nAlso what i think would help much, is to add a automatic missile commands. Most of SACLOS AA systems had the automatic lead system that would lead the missile on the optimal interception path (similar to sarh, but missile commands originate from the vehicle). I think that would increase effective range big time.",
