The \"wires\" are still non physical, something even 90's and early 2000's flight games managed to do, if your landing hook is just \"close enough\" it will suddenly stop your plane in a dime. No plane can fold their wings, except the F-14 because it folding wings is sweeping them, and it doesn't change the hitbox so you can still clip things as if they weren't swept. The elevators are still non functional. The ILS is still non functional. The AoA indicator in most planes is functional but badly tuned and if you try to follow it you will crash.",

It was possible to go too fast, hook the wire, bounce back up and the wire stopped you too high and you would fall down into the carrier and break the propeller. I've never had it happen to me but i've also read people say they broke the hook by going too fast.\n\nThis from a game from 2003 or 2004 or so.",

This opens up new possibilities when trying to defend against missiles and bombs!*\n\nSorry, what? is this even a thing in rl?\n\n*For large ships, you\u2019ll have to destroy three sections (except the front and end sections), however this will not be easier to do than destroying the ship in other ways.*\n\nRight, so instead of identifying which ships used watertight compartments, and which of those retained buoyancy depending on how many compartments we're flooded, now every single ship built since 1911 can simply only survive with 3 lost.\n\n*Depending on the class and dimensions of a ship, when one or more sections of the hull are destroyed, the irreversible flooding process begins, leading to the destruction of the ship.*\n\nSo rather than develop the game and take into account things like counterflooding to retain that buoyancy, we've now got generic irreversible flooding with no counter. \n\n*Torpedoes and mines have been given a new type of damage called hydroshock, a sudden change in pressure from an explosion. Hydroshock will cause additional damage to the hull in the form of a high-pressure sphere, the radius and damage of which will directly depend on the power of the explosive.*\n\nLiterally doesn't happen in real life, and as if those 105mph torps weren't hard enough to deal with.\n\n*There\u2019s another piece of good news for naval players. In Arcade Mode, you no longer need to lead salvos, as the gunners will do it for you. Just aim the sight at the part of the hull you want to hit and press the fire button.*\n\nSo you've now removed the single last part of any skill whatsoever that was needed in arcade.

This is also how all aspect missiles work. Yes, it happens IRL. \n\n> Literally doesn\u2019t happen in real life\n\n[Yes it does?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo)\n\n> When a torpedo with a contact fuze strikes the side of the target hull, the resulting explosion creates a bubble of expanding gas, the walls of which move faster than the speed of sound in water, thus creating a shock wave. The side of the bubble which is against the hull rips away the external plating creating a large breach. The bubble then collapses in on itself, forcing a high-speed stream of water into the breach which can destroy bulkheads and machinery in its path.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t even need to detonate in contact with the vehicle. When detonated from a short distance away, it creates something called a bubble jet. This is what [broke this ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROKS_Cheonan_(PCC-772)) into two pieces.\n\nMost intelligent German player.\n\nEdit: lol bro deleted his comment and replies before I could even respond.",
