Genuinely surprised they haven't started charging players for updating the game or to play in the test servers as well as charge players to restock \"speciality shells\" specifically ammunition that you need to research to unlock because of these shells usually being better than the stock shells. The fact this game is (technically) free to play is astounding although with how much you need to spend just to actually grind effectively (premium account time) it really isn't a free game unless you're into digital BDSM of which this is a perfect game, considering free/stock grind is so painfully slow that it legit takes anywhere 4-6 years to grind every tech tree (of one tree type not even every tech tree) if you did nothing but grind WT every day for at least 12 hours a day (that's If every match goes for the maximum match time and you make a minimum of 1000 research per match)",

Even if this is what some content creators wanted in the game who have as they say; \"infinite GE\" that Gaijin gives to them, it still doesn't remove the fact that content creators are not ALL of the playerbase, not even close. \n\n2. I understand why people are saying \"Learn to read\". But that's not the problem here. The problem here is that the \"Spend\" button for research points has ALWAYS been the first button from the left so players who have been playing for a long time have developed a muscle memory (or not, your choice) to click the \"Spend\" button which was, and I repeat, THE FIRST BUTTON from the left. \n\n3. Even if you close the window with \"Escape\" or \"B\" or whatever, IT DEFAULTS TO THE \"Purchase all modifications\" so NO, it's not matter of \"Spend your RP better\" or \"Learn to read\".\n\n4. This is purely PREDATORY and ANTI-CONSUMER behaviour from the devs to even think about putting in to the game, yet here we are.\n\n5. I understand there is a confirmation prompt for it BUT there is a confirmation prompt FOR EVERY OTHER little interaction inside the hangar menu, so MAKE IT CLEARER for what the confirmation is actually for.\n\n6. Suggestion: maybe move the button to somewhere else inside the modifications box. Maybe, oh I don't know, to the RIGHT side of it? Or you know, give an option when right-clicking the vehicle to purchase all of the modifications; maybe a \"SPADE NOW\" button.\n\nSorry about the rant but I had to get it out of my system.\n\nTL;DR: Gaijin could do a better job with notifying the user what he is using real money on, and not use cheap tricks trying to manipulate people to buy more.",
