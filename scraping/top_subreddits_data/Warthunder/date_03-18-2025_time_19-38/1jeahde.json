Maps allowed you to be creative, and use your various tanks in creative ways. I didn't find these spots op, either, since most people knew about them. Get too comfy in your sniper spot or push too hard into that ambush point, and you got smacked.\n\nI think we are rapidly going into an era where maps are becoming too samey, thanks to constant flattening \"updates\" and removal of geographical formations. I can understand getting rid of most blatant \"shoot from spawn to spawn\" issues, but jesus christ you don't have to make every map a flat surface, where the only thing differentiating it from other maps are the colors of the textures.\n\nI can cope with the grind and economy, but this map issue is a bit too much. Maps need to be interesting and different.",
