            "body": "Unfortunately...... Not really. It's slower than a fuso, it has zero rapid firing AA guns, no anti-torp protection, weakest citadel armour of any japanese battleship. Also carries around 40-50mm less pen than a Fuso does on it's AP. That being said, it's got the high level of RP modifier and  SL modifier, so it's basically just there to print money. It will be easy food for aircraft though.\n\nI've not got it, but played against them a lot, and they're not really anything to be scared of and I treat them as a fairly easy kill. \n\nGood find though. Now *please* go find the IJN Suzuya, the deepest (believed) shipwreck in history.",

Thanks for being part of finding these lost wrecks. :)\n\nI actually just picked up *Yamashiro* a few days ago as we (finally) had a sale in the Xbox store, but I haven't played her yet so can't really comment. She is in a relatively early refit (unlike *Fusou* which is modernized) so the other comment about poor AA and such likely holds true.\n\nMore broadly though, Japan has quite a fun Naval tree, especially with those excellent long lance torpedoes (even on cruisers). Today's patch also gave a penetration buff to HE shells, which should help out Japanese destroyers significantly (almost all have no AP shells).",

It was great to find both of them after reading several books on the subject and the battle. Seeing the wrecks when we deployed the ROV was something else. Both are still inverted as there was insufficient water depth for them to right themselves - just a few hundred meters. It was amazing to see the damage and compare it against the battle reports. Seems like some of the torpedo hits may have been on the opposite side. We did a cool standard deviation model of the wreck to identify areas where it had been hit. We also found all the escorting destroyers that was sunk - unfortunately I had gone on leave when they found Mogami and that\u2019s the one I really wanted to see!",

I\u2019d love to take a good look at them. \n\nCongrats on being part of the team to find them - any chances of more WW2 wreck searches happening? There\u2019s quite a fair few more ships that would be insanely cool if they could be found",
