I am so hastily that i burn my entire hand spilling boiling water on it accidentally. I break out in tears, but not because of the pain but instead because of how aweful i am and how bad of a partner War Thunder has to put up with me. But I keep quiet because i don't want to make War Thunder remember how i didn't get the raise i asked for as War Thunder wanted to so, so that War Thunder doesn't get angry again and starts hitting me yelling that we will never be able to effort that plasma-TV for watching football games this way and that i should start working harder.\n\nBut i love War Thunder, right? No, i know i love War Thunder. Right?",
