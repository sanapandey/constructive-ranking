    "selftext": "I know I will need a whole complete roof sometime in the future, but right now I got one damaged peak shingle, a venting problem in one corner causing mildew and a need for a couple pieces of new sheeting. \n\nWhy are roofing systems just all or nothing? Is this how it really is or how the roofing sales people want you to think? I have read all the roofers arguments for a whole new roof. \n\nIf I had a portion of my house\u2019s siding that was damaged, we would fix that damage and not reside the whole house. Is that just because I can paint the house and cover the fix? Why can\u2019t the shingles be better matched? Is it a wear and fading that just doesn\u2019t allow partial fixes? Do these shingle companies not design a product that can be repaired? Are asphalt roofs just a product of our throwaway culture? Because if they are, a 30k throwaway product that is \u201c30 year\u201d only lasts 15years (even with annual maintenance and cleaning) might be the biggest fucking scam in history. \n\nLast year, Historic Timberline Lodge suffered a fire and a huge hole was burned through the roof. They repaired what was damaged with new cedar shake shingles and it was ready again to winter feet of snow and rain, and huge winds. They didn\u2019t have to reroof the whole damn thing. \n\nThis is more of a general questioning. ",

They touch one portion of your roof and suddenly there\u2019s a leak somewhere else close by. 9/10 customers would say that they caused the leak and demand they fix it. There\u2019s enough work out there for them to get jobs that are entire roofs that they don\u2019t need to deal with the headaches that come with patch work.",

            "body": "With roofs, \"you touch it, you own it\".  The way I handled it with my clients is that I told them up front that the repairs (whatever they were) would be done on a \"best efforts\" basis and there would be no warranty of any kind, with the clients having to sign off on that formally (prior to us starting any work).  Those who came to me through referrals generally agreed with this, while those who did not know our work usually balked.  \n\n>  \nWhy can\u2019t the shingles be better matched? Is it a wear and fading that just doesn\u2019t allow partial fixes? Do these shingle companies not design a product that can be repaired?\n\nGranule application on shingles is generally pretty close in terms of reproducibility, but not exact.  When picking up the product at a distribution warehouse, it's really important to check that all the bundles came from the same batch/lot. Otherwise, the smart contractor will not install a mix of lots on the same visible surface because lot differences are often apparent, especially if they are on the same surface.\n\nAs for repairs, don't forget that the shingles are just part of the roofing system - the underlayment, flashings, waterproofing, etc. also need to be taken into account.",

            "body": "1. It is completely possible to repair asphalt shingle roofs. Not sure who told you otherwise. It is also possible to replace larger sections as well, but most roofers would prefer not to for a couple reasons:\n\nAs others have said, we don\u2019t want the liability. In general once we touch a roof we tend to be blamed for any problems. It\u2019s an easy way to collect bad reviews. \n\nAnother reason is it\u2019s just not financially viable lots of times. We have overhead, we need enough profit to cover that overhead. For repairs and partial replacements we have to charge a much higher profit margin to make it worth it. So in the long run you\u2019re paying more. \n\nFurther, it\u2019s just not best practice. Shake roofs and slate/ tile aren\u2019t as interconnected as shingles. You can lift and replace individual tiles without disturbing other tiles. Shingles all overlap, you only see 50% of a shingle when you look at a roof. Also ridge shingles are nailed onto both slopes. Replacing just one slope will lead to distributing the slope you don\u2019t replace. When you go to replace the old slope, you will disturb the newer one as well. Further, woven valleys are common. This makes it difficult to tear off one slope without completely messing up the other. It\u2019s easier on an up and over roof \n\n\n2. It would be impossible for manufacturers to match shingles. Shingles get their color from dyeing crushed up slate we call granules. They are produced in runs from dye packs. Even the exact same shingle brand and model can have a slightly different color depending on the lot. It\u2019s why we always order extra. If we have to run to a different store and mix up lots we risk having different colored shingles on the roof despite it being the \u201csame color\u201d.",

Almost everyone in my neighborhood got a new roof this winter while the temps were sub 40f. If shingles are installed while the temperature doesn\u2019t stay above 40 degrees for at least 24 goes it can cause them to crack and lead to poor adhesion. If they split, blow off, or don\u2019t adhere probably and they were installed while it was too cold out *they won\u2019t be covered under warranty.* I would have never guessed that was a thing unless my contractor said something about it.\n\nWe just got our new roof and we actually might have been the last house to get it done. Almost everyone else got theirs done while the temps were below freezing. My contractor refuses to do them under conditions that would void the warranty of the shingles. This week he took me on a walk and pointed out all the issues that are already popping up on the houses around us. Our heating costs were high as hell this winter but at least our roof is done right! He upgraded us from cat3 to cat4 shingles for free for being patient and trusting him when he asked us to wait.",
