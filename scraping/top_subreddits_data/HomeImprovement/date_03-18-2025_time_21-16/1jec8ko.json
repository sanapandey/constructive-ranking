            "body": "None of them. The two issues with combo sets are low quality tools and buying tools you don't need. \n\nBuy tools based based on need. Most people don't need an impact driver or circular saw for jobs around the house, yet tons of combo kits come with impact drivers and circular saws. If there's a powered cutting tool that's useful for jobs around the house, it's an oscillating multi-tool. \n\nStart with a good drill/driver, preferably one that's as short as possible. Then, buy tools based on need. If you need to cut sheet goods, you can buy a circular saw, and possibly even save by buying a corded model.",

A lot of it isn't necessary, but if you want to be able to DIY pretty much anything in your home, you'll be able to. \n\nUnless you're doing work for other people or a lot of renovations, it's not necessary to go with contractor grade. No need to spend $60 on a crescent wrench, because you'll never use it enough to notice the difference from the $8 version.\n\nNo need to go with all Milwaukee power tools and Klein electric stuff and Knipex pliers, but I wouldn't go to Temu either. If you're just doing small things as they come up, a middle-of-the-road choice is the way to go.",
