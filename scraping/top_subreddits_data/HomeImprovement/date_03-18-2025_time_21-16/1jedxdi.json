    "selftext": "I'm living in a 1970s apartment and trying to mount some shelves and maybe a TV in my living room. My electronic stud finder is finding studs 12 inches apart from each other, however, with my magnet, it's only sticking onto studs 24\" apart. \n\nAny ideas on what the \"studs\" in the middle of the 24\" spaced studs could be? It's consistently like this all around my living room. The walls have gypsum board drywall if that matters.",

We then weave sound insulation through the wall so you're not hearing your neighbors fart.\n\nIt's not done in all units, and sometimes there's a 1 inch gap that extends from top to bottom and double drywall for a fire barrier. It depends on the municipalities and various fire codes as to which one is used.",
