    "selftext": "Closing on a home in April. I want to remove this tub and put in a new tub with a shower. Trying to keep costs low. I was thinking of doing a freestanding tub with a shower. I'd like to possibly waterproof directly under the tub and add tile. Maybe even tile the whole bathroom. I am a brand new homeowner and have never done any sort of home diy. I could use advice on removal, costs, possible issues, suggestions, etc. Anything anyone can share would be helpful. Aiming for 5k or lower, tell me I'm not out of my mind. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/obTU7Vd",

To me I\u2019d want to gut the whole bathroom, I wouldn\u2019t want wood floors. But gutting a decent size bathroom is going to be $$$$$ even if you do a lot yourself. It adds up\u00a0",

If you take that tub out and replace it with something that\u2019s not the exact same size you\u2019re going to have some wood missing. Probably the easiest thing would be take out that wood floor, install some inexpensive tile. Take that tub out and replace it with a fiberglass shower enclosure or a tub and shower that\u2019s small enough where that window isn\u2019t an issue. Install a wall on the end by the window or a solid piece of glass. \u00a0If you\u2019re planning on hiring it out I\u2019d bring a few contractors in and say you want a shower the least expensive way possible and see what they suggest.\u00a0",
