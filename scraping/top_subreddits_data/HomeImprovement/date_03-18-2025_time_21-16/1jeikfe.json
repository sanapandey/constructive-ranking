    "selftext": "The installer swapped the water lines and hot is coming out of the right side.\nThe hose is going directly through the pipe and into the handle / cartridge? I\u2019m not sure how to remove from the center set so I can swap them. Thank you in advance for the help.\nIf anyone knows the name of these type of hoses/water lines that would be helpful too.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/qNETXMu\n\nEDIT:\n\nFor those looking at this in the future:\nIt\u2019s called a pull stop box.\nWith my model, you pull the pin very far out then unscrew the handle to release the cover and access the lines.",
