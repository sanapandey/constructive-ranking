    "selftext": "I just replaced an interior door and hinges with a new one. When I go to close the new one, it resists as it gets to the closed position. If I let go, it springs back open. The hinges appear to be moving as if they're being pried off the frame when I shut the door. What can I do to fix this?",

If the screw holes are a little loose I would take the door down, dip a few toothpicks in wood glue, then shove them in the holes and snip the ends off. Come back  the next day and proceed.",
