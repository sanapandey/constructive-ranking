You may suck at programming now, but thats just because you have a lot to learn, doesn't mean you're going to suck at it forever.\n\nWhen a senior developer tells you they're the best programmer on the team, its dangerous. Languages are changing all the time, operating systems are changing all the time (yes, even Linux). Devices are changing all the time. Most of the time, a senior developer has that title because they've been around the longest, not because they have the best code. Right now, theres a debate going on even in Linux because newer coders want to use memory safe languages like Rust, while older, more senior developers don't want to give up C. The dichotomy here is because if those senior developers wrote code that was memory safe to begin with, there wouldn't be a need for languages like Rust. On the other hand, Rust binaries are huge, and those newer programmers don't understand what its like to write code for, e.g., embedded systems where memory is precious and you can't take binary size for granted.\n\nThe best programmer isn't necessarily the oldest one, or the one with the most experience, or the one who knows the most languages. Somewhere in the middle is the guy who recognizes that theres a right tool for the job, and its not about preference. Sometimes that tool is C, sometimes that tool is Rust. Usually, thats a coder who doesn't know one or the other, but is smart enough to say \"This code needs to be memory safe\", or \"We're not worried about memory safety here, we need to keep this fast and small\". Senior developers almost always hate that guy, which is why that guy rarely ever gets promoted to senior developer. Usually, he drops out of programming and goes for system administration, or becomes a technician.",
