I get that it's \"useful\" for the company that doesn't want to spend, but from the customer standpoint, I don't see it, but maybe I'm wrong. It's \"customer service\" not shareholder service after all.",

As long as your AI can quickly identify if the issue is one of those issues, quickly resolve it if it is, and page a human customer service agent if it's something else, generative AI can be great for that. People were using generative AI for this long before the GPT models were even a thing. I've had positive experiences with customer service bots as a customer when they could do this well. It also means that if, say, the customer is angry about something and the standard fix for this is to give a refund or a credit, the bot can mollify the angry customer without letting them abuse a real person.",
