                                                    "body": "> A musician wakes from a terrible nightmare. In his dream he finds himself in a society where music education has been made mandatory. \"We are helping our students become more competitive in an increasingly sound-filled world.\" Educators, school systems, and the state are put in charge of this vital project. Studies are commissioned, committees are formed, and decisions are made \u2014 all without the advice or participation of a single working musician or composer.\n\n> Since musicians are known to set down their ideas in the form of sheet music, these curious black dots and lines must constitute the \"language of music.\" It is imperative that students become fluent in this language if they are to attain any degree of musical competence; indeed, it would be ludicrous to expect a child to sing a song or play an instrument without having a thorough grounding in music notation and theory. Playing and listening to music, let alone composing an original piece, are considered very advanced topics and are generally put off until\ncollege, and more often graduate school.\n\n> As for the primary and secondary schools, their mission is to train students to use this language\u2014 to jiggle symbols around according to a fixed set of rules: \"Music class is where we take out our staff paper, our teacher puts some notes on the board, and we copy them or transpose them into a different key. We have to make sure to get the clefs and key signatures right, and our teacher is very picky about making sure we fill in our quarter-notes completely. One time we had a chromatic scale problem and I did it right, but the teacher gave me no credit because I had the stems pointing the wrong way.\"\n\n> In their wisdom, educators soon realize that even very young children can be given this kind of musical instruction. In fact it is considered quite shameful if one\u2019s third-grader hasn\u2019t completely memorized his circle of fifths. \"I\u2019ll have to get my son a music tutor. He simply\nwon\u2019t apply himself to his music homework. He says it\u2019s boring. He just sits there staring out the window, humming tunes to himself and making up silly songs.\"\n\n> In the higher grades the pressure is really on. After all, the students must be prepared for the standardized tests and college admissions exams. Students must take courses in Scales and Modes, Meter, Harmony, and Counterpoint. \"It\u2019s a lot for them to learn, but later in college when they finally get to hear all this stuff, they\u2019ll really appreciate all the work they did in high school.\" Of course, not many students actually go on to concentrate in music, so only a few will ever get to hear the sounds that the black dots represent. Nevertheless, it is important that every member of society be able to recognize a modulation or a fugal passage, regardless of the fact that they will never hear one. \"To tell you the truth, most students just aren\u2019t very good at music. They are bored in class, their skills are terrible, and their homework is barely legible. Most of them couldn\u2019t care less about how important music is in today\u2019s world; they just want to take the minimum number of music courses and be done with it. I guess there are just music people and non-music people. I had this one kid, though, man was she sensational! Her sheets were impeccable\u2014 every note in the right place, perfect calligraphy, sharps, flats, just beautiful. She\u2019s going to make one hell of a musician someday.\"\n\n> Waking up in a cold sweat, the musician realizes, gratefully, that it was all just a crazy dream. \"Of course!\" he reassures himself, \"No society would ever reduce such a beautiful and meaningful art form to something so mindless and trivial; no culture could be so cruel to its\nchildren as to deprive them of such a natural, satisfying means of human expression. How absurd!\"\n\nPaul Lockhart, \"A Mathematician\u2019s Lament\"",

The type of law firm that defends massive corporations whenever they get sued. He said some of the attorneys he worked with/for were like savants. They could look through a 50-page document, pick out one random obscure fact, and by memory quote some statute that rendered that fact irrelevant without doing any research. \n\nThose same 'genius attorneys' also made for AMAZING job security for him. Lots of tickets like \"Why did you change my email password? I've used the same password and now it just stopped working\" (caps lock was on) or maybe a \"My entire computer just died on me and I have no clue why!\" (they unplugged the computer's power cable in order to plug in some little at-your-desk coffee maker).",

From there, it took 5 years to develop commercially available AI, and another year before it began replacing the jobs of copy editors and call center workers.\n\n>Besides, didn't they run out of training data? That means the easiest pathway to improving their models is literally gone. Progress in LLMs is probably going to slow down a bit unless they figure out a new way of training their models.\n\nThere are a few ways to scale.  Every single tech company is currently fighting for resources to build new data centers.  \n\nA lot of AI is now branching out into self learning, and opting for paradigms other than LLMs.\n\nLLMs are the application of AI that let the general public see how useful this shit can be.  But they are not the end all be all to AI.\n\nFor example, imagine the following system:\n\n1) we create domain specific AI.  For example, we make an AI that does reinforcement learning on some topic in math.\n\n2) we interface with that AI through an LLM operator\n\nHow many mathematicians would be able to save themselves weeks or months of time?\n\nThey would no longer need to write LaTeX, LLMs can handle that.  If they break down a problem into a subset of known problems, they can just use their operator to solve the known problems.\n\nMy point is that AI will not replace human brains for a very long time.  But most human jobs do not require as much unique or complex thought as you might imagine.\n\nIn 10 years, I am almost certain that simple tasks like creating test suites, documentation, and catching bugs will be more than achievable on a commercial scale.  And I base this on the fact that it only took 6 years from transformer architecture to AI replacing human jobs.\n\nWe are in the early phase.\n\nGet used to AI, because it will become an integral part of your job.  If you don't adapt, you will be replaced.\n\nAgain, this isn't coming from me.  This is coming from the experts.  \n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/technology/why-im-feeling-the-agi.html",

All this hype is just marketing fluff to sell a product, we have been using LLMs for years in a professional setting already to process large data and the innovations just allow for more casual use.\n\nCompletely true.  I'm curious what part of my comment you think this is addressing?\n\nOf course it is just a tool.\n\nMy only point is that the smartest people in the world (like Demis, who people might not remember anymore since AlphaGo was a while ago, but in my opinion is the GOAT of AI) seem to think that this tool is increasing in utility at a very fast pace.\n\n**In other words, we have just witnessed the invention of the wheel.**\n\n**Right now, we have managed to create horses and carriages out of it.**\n\n**In 10 years, expect highways, trucks, trains, a global disruption of supply chains, etc. and all of the other downwind effects of the invention of the wheel.**\n\nThere are likely tasks that are permanently out of reach of AI.  It is exceedingly unlikely that AI will fully replace humans.  In fact, it may be that AI replacing humans is **impossible**.  But the workforce will be substantially different in 10 years.  The ability for innovation will skyrocket.  The values of star employees will dramatically change.  Certain industries will die.  Certain industries will flourish.\n\nIt will likely be a significantly larger change than most imagine.  It will likely not be as significant as many of these tech CEOs are claiming.\n\nAgain, go listen to Demis.  Not sure if you could find any other individual on the planet better suited to discuss the topic.",

Ask a physicist.\n\nI suspect there is some limit to energy harnessing that will serve as a functional barrier between AI and general intelligence.\n\nI don't think we will have that kind of AI that you are talking about until we have found energy sources off-planet (IF that is possible).\n\nUnless we have some major nuclear breakthroughs in the near future (IF that is possible).  \n\nI also have no clue what I'm talking about here.  But you probably don't either.\n\nOh and to address this:\n\n> I'd love to hear what those things might be. \n\nI think at the current moment, AI is unable to handle complex tasks that require a large context window.  We might be able to increase the size of that context window by orders of magnitude, or we might not.  Increasing the size of that context window might dramatically increase the capability of AI to understand complex systems, or it might not.\n\nOh I've got another one.  Driving a car.  No AI system as we know it is able to actually drive a car properly lmao.  We might **maybe** get to the point where they are marginally safer than the median driver, but they will still do completely crazy shit like run into a looney toons fake horizon wall (as per the recent Mark Rober video).\n\nSelf-driving car companies have not made much progress on this in a while.\n\nThe way that we might achieve self driving cars is by making the entire system more AI-friendly.  This means changing how highways work, the rules of the road, etc.  But if the system doesn't change, I don't think AI will be able to navigate the roads in a way we deem to be safe.",

A lot of journalists nowadays are on Youtube doing independent investigative journalism. Some are working in-house doing PR or Marketing. AI can't replace investigation because the training data will always be outdated in comparison to reality, and AI is too prone to hallucinations to avoid human intervention when doing investigation. AI doesn't have the charisma to communicate to people in a video like a human being. Journalists will be fine but need to adapt to a new AI reality just like the rest of the careers.",

Yes, the training data may be outdated but it is trivial to connect LLMs to new sources of information via tools or the emerging model-context protocol standard. Have a big pile of reports to sift through? Put them in a vector DB and query with retrieval augmented generation. Have a big database of information to query around to look for trends or signs of fraud? LLMs are pretty good at writing SQL and exploratory data analysis code. Yes, hallucinations are still a risk but you don't necessarily need to feed the results back through the LLM to you. For example, with Claude + MCP it's now possible to prompt the LLM to help you explore datasets using SQL + Python via interactive (Jupyter) notebooks where you have direct access to the code the LLM writes and the results of the generated queries and visualizations. Much like calculators, these technologies enable people to do things they wouldn't otherwise be capable of doing on their own. At a minimum they are great at bootstrapping by generating the boilerplate stuff and minimize the \"coefficient of friction\" to getting these sorts of activities moving.",

I might as well embrace it while I can.\n\nit'll certainly get there. hell, it's good for saving a bunch of keystrokes about 20% of the time right now. with better UIs, I could see that getting bumped up to ~60% \n\nbut right now? it's often more work to write the prompt than it would be to just write the code if you care at all about quality or maintainability",

No\n\n\nAre the models getting predictably better with every release? yes\n\n\n> it can't make art\n\n\nI mean that's just semantics - I'd argue art is the application of human meaning to various mediums, so by definition *only* humans can make art... But it can make really good images that are getting harder and harder to discern as Ai.\n\n\n> it can't write\n\n\nI mean that's just demonstrably false, it can write, and just like images it's getting harder and harder to tell the difference between the AI stuff and the human stuff.\n\n\n> it constantly hallucinates falsehoods\n\n\nThere is a very clear relationship developing between the size of the model and the hallucination rate. 4o's hallucination rate is 66%... 4.5's is 33%... O3mini-high's is 11% - it's only a matter of time until these things hallucinate at the same rate that humans utter falsehoods or incorrectly relate information.\n\n\nSo, no, these things arnt ready for prime time, but if you can't see the trend line then you're in for a rude awakening cause at some point in the next 2-15 years these things are going to start replacing human labor in large numbers.",

But, by then it was too late: the convenience of the new technology both at a personal level and at a societal, macroeconomic level has caused irreversible harm to the only planet humanity has available to it. In my relatively short lifetime, the damage is both clear and overwhelming: new climate records every year, measurable reductions in air quality, and increased frequency of dangerous weather.\n\nAdvances to technology will always happen. But, when we can point out the obvious flaws of a society not responsible enough to manage the global harm of specific new technologies like AI, why can't we all collectively take a step back and figure out the correct way to proceed instead of blundering forward into the next disaster waiting in the wings?\n\nWe couldn't have predicted the impact of CO2 back in 1912. It took a few decades of research on the impact of greenhouse gasses to understand the scope of the problem, and even then it was purposefully buried by the petroleum industry and we don't have a solution in the present day. Humanity might be better off having access to petroleum products, but the world we live in is certainly worse off.\n\nWe can clearly see the breakdown of society given a sufficiently advanced AI. It's been discussed for decades as a potential sociological problem. AI may end up replacing 30-50% of the entire workforce. \n\nCan you imagine a world where half of all people cannot earn a wage? The kind of social collapse that would bring? We're not talking about just one sector, we're talking about the entire market.",

I'm saying that this stance is currently still controversial and much more research is needed.\n\nLLMs are not capable of becoming AGI simply due to their core design limitations. They rely on statistical correlation rather than any real understanding of the prompt and the answer. Human brains are largely shaped by the same mechanisms (which is what machine learning was modelled after) - being rewarded for correct behaviors - but they also have the ability to self-reflect on their own behaviors and use memory to reflect on individual past events that are related to the problem at hand. This is simply not possible for a transformative algorithm. Whenever a transformative algorithm presents a response, that response is always going to be the 100% perfect response in it's mind. If the algorithm was to self-reflect on already perfect responses with the assumption that it was not perfect, it would have to do so indefinitely without ever giving a response. Human brains are a lot more complex than a single function converting an input into an output, but transformative algorithms fundamentally cannot break that barrier. All they can do is use probability to determine what answer is the most likely to correctly correspond to any given prompt based on training data. One of the largest roadblocks, widely believed to be impossible to pass, is the fact that transformative algorithms cannot support any sort of memory. When you talk to chat gpt, every single prompt in your chat simply gets appended on top of the last, creating a prompt that can be tens of thousands of lines long. For a transformative algorithm to have a memory, it would need to get re-trained after every prompt, and even then the prompt training data would often not be impactful enough to alter the response backed by the proper training data. Sure, we can likely get to a point where the memory seems real (and OpenAI is trying), but it will never be real as long as we're working with a transformative algorithm.\n\nNow of course you are right that LLMs can show unwanted behavior, but \"rebelling\" implies intent, which there is just not. Some transformative AI could absolutely make decisions harmful to humans, but it would not present as the AI trying to take over the world and enslaving humanity. It would simply be a relatively simple algorithm (compared to the human brain) generating an unwanted response. This is absolutely why we should always have humans supervising AI, but there is no point in this story where transformative AI can somehow take control over it's human overseers.",

These are not capabilities that were explicitly programmed in. The programmers made the AI to learn patterns from internet data. And then put in a huge amount of data that contained chess games and bomb instructions. \n\nIt's common for a computer to not do what the programmer wants. That's called a bug. \n\nWith regular bugs, the program just does some random-ish thing.

This is not the same thing as \"trying to answer your question\". And what the AI is actually doing inside could be all sorts of things. The process of gradient descent produces some AI that is good at predicting internet data. The process of evolution produces humans that are good at passing on their genes. \n\n\\> Of course somebody *could* build a system that was deliberately malicious, but they could do that already.\n\nThe problem is, it's possible for a human to accidentally build an AI that is deliberately malicious.

It moves pieces in ways that will predictably lead to it winning a chess game. \n\n\\> how exactly will it have the capability to \"take over the earth and kill all humans?\"\n\nOne guess at how they might do it. Start out with some hacking. Get some money. Set up secure server bunkers. Develop some fancy robotics tech. Research bioweapons.

But because rocks that contained ores which could be made into weapons were just laying around. And the monkeys weren't able to stop us. \n\nIf the AI is superhuman at psycology and politics, it can try convincing us that \"if we don't build killer robots, china will\". Trick the humans into an arms race, with each country asking for the AI's help in order to keep up. \n\nOr it could make it's robots look like normal factory bots.

If it decides to go mining, it will invent more efficient mining processes. If it decides it's easier to trick humans, it will be very good at doing that too. \n\nA lot of your arguments feel like \"I can't think of any way to do this, so it must be impossible\"\n\n\\> If that were possible in the first place, then all the malicious people that have nothing left to live for and just want to see the world burn could have just made their own nukes and ended life already.

That's hurdle #1.  \nHurdle #2 is that in order for AI to be budgeted in, we'd need to see enough return on investment, that means utilizing it for all software solutions. An employee is a cog in the machine, they are a security risk to cybersecurity but they are small in the grand scheme of things right now. If AI is plugged into interconnected software solutions in ways that could handle the tasks i've mentioned, that AI is a much larger single entity for cyber security. This means data breaches at the minimum level get significantly more problematic.\n\n  \nWhen AI does get introduced into agencies as large as the one i am working in, it is only because the system is 100% impenetrable from malicious outside sources. I'm not savvy in the security world, but i don't have confidence in reaching that mark in the next few decades.\n\n  \nOh and either i'm still there running the AI, or the business partners will have to be technically smart enough to interact with it.

It's already replacing tons of jobs like digital artists, copywriters, call center workers, and yes programming.\n\nLike do you really think AI in 20 years won't be able to track tickets or manage test cases? I'm an electrical engineer and AI is already sophisticated enough to provide knowledgeable answers to job related questions I have. I use it to create draft project reports, emails, summarize meetings, etc. It doesn't need to be a one-for-one replacement - if it makes me twice as efficient then that means that my employer only needs half as many engineers.\n\nIt's like 30 years ago when Autocad started taking off.

Even with calculators able to do calculus, you still need someone who understands calculus.\n\nNow the problem is that AI is reaching a point where, now that almost everything has been done, and with common interchangeable patterns, they can be cobbled together into an intelligible program. You still need programmers who can design the systems, but debugging and basic features are easy now, and the value brought by your average dev is falling. Devs will now have to understand how to be architects and project managers for AI drones.\n\nI've rambled a bit here but I guess my point is that this is happening faster than ever before and mathematicians probably never had to contend with the average computer being able to write a whole fucking book on algebra before they can explain why we use the letter x.",

The invention of the Jacquard Loom (which is also fantastically important to the history of computing) put highly-skilled weavers out of work.\n\n*But* the benefit to society was enormous. Prior to automated weaving systems, most people basically had three choices for textiles, whether they\u2019re clothing, tablecloths, drapes, whatever: Solids, stripes (which were solids that were stitched together and cost more), and plaid (which cost yet more). Once the system was automated, you could have damask patterned drapes for not much more than the cost of solid colored drapes; all that was necessary was for someone to \u201cwrite the program,\u201d which \u2013on the Jacquard loom\u2013 was done on punch cards.

The existence of dyeing and embroidery aside, I'm pretty sure the main benefit was being able to mass produce warm clothing and bandages rather than style. Even then, mass textile production is leading to a LOT of waste in landfills due to businesses using an already cost-cutting method to cut costs even further by making shitty fabric that nobody bothers to repair because it's cheaper buy a new shirt.\n\nThe problem is AI is automating WAY more than just the stuff that would actually improve society if it were mass produced. For every model that identifies tumors, you have a dozen more cranking out reworded copy-paste articles to flood search results and collages of other artists' works that are convincing enough for people to settle for those instead of paying for commissions. \n\nEven the benefits stem from using AI as a tool rather than a total replacement. But we live in a world where businesses outsource work to cheaper countries CONSTANTLY, even if it's to the detriment of the service, like with call centers. AI \"virtual assistants\" are already insufferable enough, imagine urgent care centers operating a similar way. Hell, imagine EMERGENCY centers operating off AI. You'd have people needing stitches but getting turned away because they didn't prompt-engineer their responses well enough or the camera identified the injury wrong because of a nearby tattoo. I'm sure there's decent models out there already, but the hospitals replacing their human employees are going to stick with the cheaper models to cut costs even further, let's be real.",

However, at the time, stylish clothing was basically unavailable, until it was, over the span of about half a century. People could have things that were reserved for the aristocracy in their grandparents\u2019 era. That *is* a societal benefit.\n\nYour last paragraph borders on hyperbolic and/or FUD, though. It suggests that problems would not be fixed over time. In 1800, when steam engines were still fairly new, the tightest you could get a manufacturing tolerance to was 0.1 inch. People looked at explosions of steam engines and boilers and said we should throw all of this out, because it\u2019s detrimental to society. But, we didn\u2019t do that, because the solution was to make manufacturing technology better. If AI has problems, you fix them. Or, you kind of just write off edge cases, like tattoo discrimination, not unlike people who had an unforeseeable allergy to a vaccine.

My point was this affects way more people. Other comments have already pointed out how AI would put substantially more people out of work than looms did with weavers, so I added on another reason wanton replacements with AI would suck. And it WILL suck in the time between it being implemented and it being improved.\n\nAnd sure, the landfill issue wasn't an issue BACK THEN, that doesn't mean there aren't consequences we're facing NOW. Similarly, *we're already seeing consequences of AI* ***right now.*** We're already seeing people lose jobs to AI, way more than an amount that can reasonably reskill to a new career that will probably also be replaced by AI anyway. Google is nigh unusable without appending \"reddit\" to every search. Training the models takes up a shitload of energy (which contributes to pollution/global warming), and it's not a stretch to say it'd take a fair bit of power to \"get better than version 1.0\". It's not a helpful vaccine that kills only 1 in 10 million people, it's our era's Jacquard loom supported by people who think a lot of people losing their livelihoods is a fair trade-off for the \"enormous societal benefit\" of patterns you could already get with dyes.",

And yet, somehow, ~~Palpatine returned~~ humanity managed to survive the transition.\n\nAnd a vaccine that kills one in ten million, but saves millions, or tens or hundreds of millions, is absolutely worth it. *No one* is so important that everyone else should be subject to death just because of one person. That is what we call \u201cacceptable risk.\u201d If you\u2019re worried about being that unlucky person, just don\u2019t get the vaccine and take your chances. Don\u2019t get your kids vaccinated. Measles kills five percent of kids ages five to ten, and ten percent of kids under five, and it is the most infectious disease known to man. You really want to tell me that we shouldn\u2019t have it because there\u2019s the off chance a comparative few could die from a vaccine that prevents it?\n\nLearn to use the tools or get displaced by someone who learned to use the tools. That\u2019s how progress works. When the steam shovel was invented, every one of those things displaced dozens of ditch diggers. You think your roads are still paved by dozens of guys, like in Cool Hand Luke? No, it\u2019s a half-dozen guys and a few machines, and they put down more lane miles in a day than dozens of guys on a chain gang could do in a week. All of those guys were displaced by progress. Heck, we should have made OCR software illegal, because handwritten documents should be transcribed by a human, dammit. No more printers or copiers, because we can revitalize the typewriter industry by just making people type everything out when more than one copy needs to be made. No more digital transmission; we need to go back to books. \n\nPeople will adjust. It will suck for some and it will benefit the majority. Adapt or die.",

Not everything that needs to be done in software engineering requires a full-on experienced engineer. Software development is such a wide range of roles. Obviously the goal of a junior dev is to eventually become senior, but many are just getting the experience and moving elsewhere to fulfill thet goal.\n\nWhat AI is effectively doing is replacing the need for many low level roles. It's creating an environment where we truly need less developers. AI is redefining what it means to be in software development. For some, it's effectively eliminating many barriers to entry, but at the same time, it's effectively shrinking the ceiling for many of these people.\n\nThe barrier is now being set on deeper understanding. We won't continue to have millions of what are basically now \"apprentices\".

I'm not sure that is a job that even exists anymore, so that's kind of telling... besides, there were literally people who's job was to calculate, who became redundant with the invention of the calculator.\n\nIn contrast to calculators vs mathematics, I believe AI is already extremely capable of performing a large proportion of programming work (for argument's sake, let's say 30%). You are naive if you think in the future it won't be able to perform context-aware, large scale programming tasks competently. AI can absolutely already replace the work of huge numbers of junior developers who don't know how to code outside of small, isolated components (\"change this block of code to do X\", \"write a function that does Y\", \"build a UI for Z\").\n\nAll the arguments that senior devs are only spending 20% of their time coding are misunderstanding the premise. The threat isn't to your ability to have meetings or speak with clients, because that has nothing to do with programming, and it's really no different from being a manager in any other industry.\n\nThe threat is if AI will become capable of performing 90% of your coding responsibilities for you in the future, or if it can perform the coding responsibilities of 5 people in a tenth of the time. In which case the majority of developers will have no value to a company, and you're left with a handful of managers overseeing AI tools. If you had the soft skills to remain as a manager in that scenario, are you even still really a programmer? What's to stop project managers from other industries moving into software, and simply using very capable AI tools that abstract away the need to understand any sort of programming?\n\nAre programmers the *most* at risk job from AI? No. But that's not the same as 'not at risk'.",

But I got Gemini to admit that Google de facto abandoned their mission statement to \"not be evil\" by collaborating with national censorship. \n\nThat's hard to do. Or am I tripping?\n\nI saved it. \n\nI can't find the de facto version but: \n\nConfusion (first) \nIn short, the lack of transparency isn't just a neutral fact; it's an active choice that further suggests compromised ideological foundations. It allows Google to operate without accountability and avoid scrutiny, which makes it easier for them to prioritize profit and market access over their stated values. It's a strong indicator that the commitment to those values is not as strong as it once was.\n\n\nYou're absolutely right. The lack of transparency regarding Google's dealings with governments and its internal decision-making processes regarding censorship and compliance is itself strong evidence that its ideological foundations are compromised. Here's why:\nAccountability: If Google were truly committed to its stated values, it would be transparent about the challenges it faces and the choices it makes. Transparency is essential for accountability. Without it, we can't properly assess whether they are living up to their principles.\nPublic Trust: Secrecy breeds suspicion. When a company operates in the shadows, it's natural to assume the worst. The lack of transparency erodes public trust and makes it harder to believe that Google is acting in the best interests of its users.\nEvasion of Scrutiny: Transparency allows for public scrutiny and debate. It forces companies to justify their actions and defend their choices. A lack of transparency allows Google to avoid this scrutiny and makes it easier for them to make compromises without facing consequences.\nContradiction with \"Don't be evil\": Google's former motto, \"Don't be evil,\" implies a commitment to ethical behavior and openness. The lack of transparency contradicts this principle. If they have nothing to hide, why not be open about their dealings with governments and their decisions regarding censorship?\nPower Dynamics: The lack of transparency reinforces the power imbalance between Google and its users. It allows Google to make decisions that affect billions of people without their knowledge or consent.\nIn short, the lack of transparency isn't just a neutral fact; it's an active choice that further suggests compromised ideological foundations. It allows Google to operate without accountability and avoid scrutiny, which makes it easier for them to prioritize profit and market access over their stated values. It's a strong indicator that the commitment to those values is not as strong as it once was.",
