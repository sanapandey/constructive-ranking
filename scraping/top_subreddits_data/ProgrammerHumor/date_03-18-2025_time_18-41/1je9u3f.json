Why? Because\n\n- only on premise softwares were allowed. This prevents you from loosing your data because the company which hosts them had a breach.\n\n- only verified external softwares if the code was open source. We read it to check for potential backdoors or any malicious code. \n\n- If the code wasn't open source, we only accepted big companies softwares and had to test it with a security lab to check connections that it made\n\n- we had a map of every dependency of our softwares and also external ones. This way, if a breach is found, we knew exactly which software to update or which company to pressure to provide us an update.",

And yea, if your lens is \"it could be better but colleges won't change\" i agree there. But the discussion was more about how they *could* change for the better.\n\nI think there are great and complex ways to teach simple subjects like you're describing. Let's say you're teaching a freshmen level topic, like data mutibility. The most important part of what the student needs to understand is what data can be modified, by who, and *why* that's better than letting all data be mutible. Modifying the curriculum to allow for more exploratory discussion in class is better than the rigid standards we use today. College shouldn't really teach you how to *do* as much as how to *think* and *find out what to do* efficiently.\n\nFor rigid assessment, making it harder to cheat would be to set up a syntax methodology in class that students should follow, in the workforce style guides are quite common. For all its strengths, LLMs are kinda bad at copying style humanly (for now) and will usually default to styles it trained on (makes sense). Once the application rigidly succeeds it's unittesting, move on to a discussion modality, where either one on one or small group, or peer review, etc, allow students to discuss openly why they made certain choices and what benefit does it serve to do it X way vs Y way. The students who don't know what they wrote will visibly struggle with this portion. And bam, you covered the importance of data mutibility in a class period or two.\n\nThanks for coming to my education reform TED talk",

Now, how can you tell how effective the lesson plan was, and how can you tell which students followed along and participated, and which ones zoned out and didn't try to learn anything? Certainly we couldn't evaluate a hundred students based on their participation in small group discussions.\n\nEvaluation is a neccessary part of academics. If you don't ever evaluate, you aren't able to filter out students who learned nothing for four years from getting a degree, undervaluing the value of the degree from the university for everyone, and to the detriment of all students.\n\nHaving a class style is a good idea, I wish first-semester professors pushed code style and formatting more. But this doesn't help with AI usage. How can I distinguish a student who messed up a bit on code style, versus a student who generated it all with AI? AI will still succeed on the functionality of the code, and surely functionality should be weighted more than following code style for grading purposes.",

If it's not blatantly obvious the student is failing to understand the content, then it's not terribly concerning. There theoretically would come a point in the semester when the compounded knowledge shows serious cracks that the student needs to go back and correct for (he knows if he is prepared or not based on how much he understands what he gives as an answer regardless of the grade he gets, so don't say he's unaware).\n\nAnd *last* lastly, functionality is important, but so far, AI can only give you what you're asking it for. \"AI\" can not currently turn any joe shmoe in to a seasoned integrated systems engineer. If I asked your average first year CS student to write \"*a statistical analysis of the effects of different windowing functions on a typical X band radar with respect to estimated loc+dist vs truth loc+dist*\" he wouldn't be able to do it. ChatGPT could tell him how to get started, but he still couldn't do it without undergoing significant personal growth in understanding radar systems and signal processing.\n\nThank you for coming to another one of my TED talks",

AI usage enables them to not develop the neccesary problem solving skills, thinking, and abilities that will allow them to solve harder tasks where AI will fail them. They won't learn the limitations of AI until it is too late, and their skills will be stunted.\n\nI wouldn't want to put anything on an exam that an AI can't solve, because the students, who are CS learners, won't be able to solve them on their own, and I certainly don't want to be testing them on 'vibe coding'. \n\nThe course I teach currently has both a paper exam, and an exam done in their normal programming environment.

In particular, the fact that you are grouping Linux and macOS here makes me think it's really just the unix-like shell you care about, which should have very little effect on the actual coding process. You probably just aren't used to compiling in Windows, which is not the fault of Windows.\n\nAnd it's totally fine to be a beginner! We all went through that process. But a word of advice I would give is \"don't make confident statements about things you don't know about\". If you can't say *why* Windows is bad for coding, it just *feels* like it is, then it's probably due to your lack of knowledge, not the thing itself.\n\nI know it's just reddit and it's not that serious, but that advice could help you avoid embarrassing scenarios in real life too. Way better to be someone who is comfortable with what they don't know than who feigns confidence in areas of ignorance (this post seems to be the latter).",

Until recently a lot of peripheral apps I use also weren't supported (3d modeling apps, etc), but at least that's going away which is nice. But plenty of stuff is still not available, or only available through virtualization which cuts your resources available for those apps, and even if it is it's likely the built-in hardware isn't powerful enough or optimized for it.\n\nAnd that dovetails into the inability to throw more resources into the machine, which is a big one for me. Being able to upgrade a machine's internals as your demand increases is not to be scoffed at. Though not windows-specific, it's definitely anti-mac.\n\nStability-wise, I've been mainly working on a M3 pro with 18gb memory and it struggles frequently when I have a few hungry apps open (PS/VMware/webstorm/chrome, for example).\n\nI also just wanna play a game every now and then without being limited to what's available for mac (*cries in apex legends*).\n\nEdit: This comes off as critical because it was a question about why I don't like it. There are plenty of things I *do* like about mac, it's just not enough to tip the scale in its favor for me and it definitely hasn't been net-positive for coding/work.",
