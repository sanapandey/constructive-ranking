Dichos huecos, luego quedan cubiertos por los objetos con los que decoramos las paredes.\n\nENGLISH: Must be a small opening in your walls. Often times, while we are placing walls, one of the pieces \"skips\" a spot and leaves a small, easy to miss, open spot. Some furniture, and wall decorations, tend to hide small wall openings too.",
