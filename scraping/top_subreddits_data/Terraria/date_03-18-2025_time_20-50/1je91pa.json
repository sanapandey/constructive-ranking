The summon item will eventually appear on the grass as a red flower, which can be mined with a pickaxe.\n\nFor hardcore characters, or so I've heard, killing NPCs can make them drop the required gravestones. To accomplish this, catch 5 stinkbugs (green, flying bugs), craft a golden or platinum sword, place some liquid honey (or just stand by some) as if it were a crafting station, and craft the flymeal. It lets you hit friendly NPCs. If you don't want to kill any of your fellow townsfolk, just beat the angler with it until you get the message that he's moved out.",
