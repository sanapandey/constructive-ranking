    "selftext": "Ok, so I've been looking at Terraria for a while now and I'm inclined to get it. Nonetheless, since it's to play with my 9 and 11 year-old kids, I'd like some sanity checking, so I've come to the most ~~biased~~ knowledgeable place on Reddit I could find. :) \n\nThey're not \"difficult game\" kind of gamers, they like to collaborate and create things. They do a lot of Creative (and survival) Minecraft, but very casual - they enjoy the exploring and building part of it (not necessarily the \"discover new recipe\" and \"how can I craft X\" part though). They like that, if they lose, they just respawn and keep going.\n\nI was hoping that Terraria could satisfy that itch as well - hoping that they are not forced to get into battles unless they want to, or that we can collaborate in that they can explore, gather resources, build and take care of our base, and potentially come on quests/adventures/missions with me for the more action-y/difficult parts.\n\nIs Terraria a good choice in this context? Am I looking at it the wrong way? How are the controls - complex, or mostly movement, mouse and a couple of keys?\n\nThanks!",

While its technically not required to beat bosses, killing bosses unlocks npcs, blocks, a couple very specific biomes, better gear and accessories, and so on. If you are going to play, i highly recommend having the wiki readily available since the guide(npc) can be useless at times.\n\nEdit: The only way to have perma death in terraria is to play hardcore. (not recommended for new players) Terraria is generally pretty forgiving with deaths. You dont drop items unless your character is mediumcore or hardcore. You just drop some of your money in the other difficulties.",

But I assume I can be the one defeating those bosses (with their help, should they want to), but it won't deter from their enjoyment if they just rant to keep building with their current inventory? \n\nAlso, is there a mode where we have full access to everything we can use/craft, and/or is there meta progression in that when you unlock specific items/materials they're available in all worlds? \n\nI don't expect that to be the case, but thought I'd ask.",

Boss progression is tied to the world. NPC progression is tied to the world. The only progression tied to characters is health and mana.\n\nThe world itself is the progress, in a way. You build on it, you terraform it, you extract resources from it and defend it from threats. The character is only a vessel to do such with, in a gameplay sense. You upgrade your character and get stronger gear, of course, but new events do not occur because you got new items, and having new items will almost never give you access to anything new without also progressing the world in some way.",

The blocks gotten from trees and cacti do act as blocks and cannot be mined with an axe.)\n\nWalls are tiles placed on the layer behind blocks. Walls and blocks can occupy the same space. Walls are generally crafted with their block counterpart. (Some require you to craft in graveyard biome.) Walls are broken with hammers, which is not included with your starting tools.\n\nHammers are also used to shape blocks certain ways. It cycles through the different block orientations one by one as you click the same block. \n\nHope this helps :D",

Using a mouse makes building and aiming easier, and a keyboard/controller makes movement a bit more intuitive than touch controls. \n\nThat said, mobile does have some pretty extensive touch control customization options that can make playing much easier. Mobile version is also cheaper if I recall correctly, so it would be less of an investment. On-top of that, mobile is, well, mobile. You can take Terraria on road trips and flights. It's also easier to start and stop playing when needed.\n\nHonestly it just depends.

            "body": "Terraria focuses less on exploration and \"sandboxy-ness\" than Minecraft, but both of those aspects are still very much part of the game. It unfortunately doesn't offer a creative mode like Minecraft's, but it has an alternative: Journey Mode. In Journey Mode, you have complete control over weather, enemy spawn rate, difficulty and time. If you gather a certain amount of an item and research it (\"consuming\" the item), you will be able to duplicate it infinitely. It also features Godmode, a toggleable power that makes you invincible. You also spawn with some basic starter gear, helping with mobility, combat and exploration. You still have to find most of the items you want to duplicate, but it can offer a similar experience to Minecraft's Creative Mode. There's probably also a mod that adds a true creative mode.\n\nIn terms of quests/adventures, Terraria has a lot to offer, but it's often combat-related. There's a fairly extensive fishing system, but that might get boring for someone interested in expressing creativity. Most of the \"adventures\" you'll find are bosses, which each unlock unique and more powerful items. These aren't necessarily intended to feel like adventures, but can be framed/viewed like adventures as preparation is highly recommended (crafting potions, obtaining better gear, building an arena). Invasion events also occur sometimes, during which enemies of a certain theme (marsians, pirates, goblins, etc...) swarm your location and will only stop once you've defeated enough of them. These also always offer new equipment and other items.\n\nIn terms of controls, it's not too complex: A and D to move horizontally, space to jump/fly, LMB to break/attack, RMB to interact, E to grapple and a couple of miscellaneous ones. All of these can also be adjusted in the settings.\n\nThere's also lots of well-made mods, ranging from small UI/QoL changes to complete overhaul mods, with modding also being very straightforward.\n\nTL;DR: Terraria definitely has potential, but might overall be a bit less suitable for your specific use case than Minecraft.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any further questions!",

            "body": "It could be an option, but it's more complex and difficult in quite a few ways. However, there are ways around most of that.\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye is the \"discover new recipe\" stuff. Terraria isn't the best for beginners to learn how to get equipment and things, with the vast majority of players relying on the wiki for this. An NPC, the Guide, will tell you some important information and has a menu where you can see everything that can be crafted with a certain material if you have it, but that's a lot of trial and error if you don't know what's available. Aside from that though, there's not much in-game for information. In terms of gear as well, there are a lot more options compared to Minecraft with all sorts of unique perks and progression is much more gradual too.\n\nOn that topic, unlike in Minecraft where the further you get the more likely you are to survive, entering the game's second stage (called Hardmode) by beating a boss significantly increases the difficulty everywhere, adding new enemies but providing access to stronger gear. This sounds like something you might want to avoid if you do decide to go ahead with it. It's required for progression if beating the game is something you decide to do, but given the difficulty I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nFights can be quite difficult to avoid. At night, you can choose to stay inside shelter. Zombies can't break doors in this game, you'll be happy to know. Sometimes you'll be stuck on the far end of the world and you have to try to get back or box yourself in, but that's fine. There's a similar system to Minecraft for respawns too, as that's something you mentioned. By default, you will only lose half of the money you're carrying on death. You can make this drop more, but this is nice for early players. It can be a real inconvenience to get everything back if you lose it otherwise.\n\nIt's not a particularly difficult game as games get, but it's still not as basic as Minecraft is. Different biomes have varying required skill levels and lots of unique enemies with unique drops that are used in all sorts of crafting recipes. Basically, there's a lot to learn. There's still a lot that I've never seen before and I've been playing on and off since 2015-ish.\n\nHOWEVER, the one redeeming quality of this is the mode that was introduced in a recent update\u00b9, Journey mode. This is comparable to Minecraft's Creative but has more built-in control over some areas but less in others. You can become invincible at will, control times of day, difficulty, spawn rates, and duplicate items once you've collected enough of them. You don't get everything straight away like in the Creative menu, but this means you're forced to learn a little bit on the way. I'd imagine this would be perfect for this scenario. It's a great way to learn the core aspects of the game without being put in difficult unwanted scenarios, and it's the best for building because of the duplication. It makes bosses easier and more accessible to younger players too. If you were to play it, I'd definitely consider going for one of these playthroughs.\n\nWhatever you decide, it's absolutely fine. If not now, maybe they'll enjoy it more when they're older. Or maybe not, it's not for everyone. If you do decide to though, I hope you all enjoy it. :)\n\n(pardon my knowledge of Minecraft, I haven't played any recent versions, I hope the core game hasn't changed too much since 1.4 rendering everything I just said invalid)\n\n\u00b9 EDIT: just realised this update is about 5 years old. Whoops, I'm getting old...",

            "body": "Another thing to note about the game that is different from Minecraft is character classes. There are 3 main classes to try. Melee, summoner, and ranged. \n\nMelee is pretty easy to get the hang of if they played Minecraft, but it does require getting close to the enemies. Get big stick and go bonk. It's really satisfying and will help develop movement skills.\n\nSummoner is great because you essentially have creatures that follow you and attack any enemies within your line of sight (roughly). You can have gear that allows multiple minions, too. It's really easy to play safe as a summoner.\n\nRanged is also viable and can be a blast. There are guns, bows, staff, and other weapons that are unique, like the light discs. This class allows players to easily stay at a safe distance when paired with some movement.\n\n\nOverall, each class is quite fun to experiment with. There's a build for everyone. I personally like playing a tanky Melee character with the option to have a summoned minion and a few powerful ranged weapons as back ups. Minecraft, in comparison, is very dry with how you can build your gear. Terraria offers far superior customization of your characters.\n\nHope this helps!",

My kids and I have had a lots of fun with Terraria and it's still one of my son's favorite games.\n\nThere's more battling for sure, as the progression involves more combat and enemy drops compared to Minecraft, especially once the world transforms, but enemies do not spawn around your village unless it's a blood moon. However, the combat is MUCH more interesting and enjoyable than in Minecraft, with a lot more variety in gear as well. Tons of room for creativity in building as well. Dying is not harshly punished; you just lose half the money you have, and you get items to stash money reasonably early on.\n\nControls are simple. Basic movement, mouse aiming, toolbar, inventory, and a couple of modifier keys for smart tool functionality (e.g., hold down Q to put your tool in hand temporarily)\n\nOne of the Terraria game modes also lets you spawn items once you've collected enough of them (e.g., 99 wood blocks and then you can spawn them), so it's a nice mix of creative and survival: progression, but you don't have to grind EVERYTHING.\n\nI'd also recommend Grounded and Wobbly Life as well. The former is \"you shrank and are in a yard\" with a lot of good building, and the latter is a fun/silly sandbox game that they both enjoyed playing together. No building in it though.\n\nWe have 3 copies of all of the above games so we can all play together.\n\nThey also both like Teardown (voxel destruction game) and Flashing Lights (police/fire/ambulance sim).",
