But I don\u2019t expect them to have any certainty in anything until they give an exact date. Iirc they\u2019ve never delayed an update they announced the release date for prior. Waiting absurdly long periods of time is a part of the Terraria experience. Anybody who remembers how long it took for Terraria Console and Mobile to be updated to 1.3 is intimately aware of this.\n\nAnd at this point, I wouldn\u2019t be suprised if they pull another 1.4 senario and make this update 1.5. For those not in the know, 1.4 was inititally supposed to be 1.3.6, but it got feature creep\u2019ed so much that Re-Logic decided to rebrand it.\n\nThe only other company that is like this to my knowledge is Valve. They never release something that isn\u2019t ready to be released. But in exchange we\u2019re waiting literal years for them to really do much of anything.",
