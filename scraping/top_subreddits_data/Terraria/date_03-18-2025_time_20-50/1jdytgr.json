The dood who made the initial video claiming all that was the whole talk of the costream/questions Asmongold was asking, and later afterwards Pirate Software even made a tweet about the topic and the stream with Asmongold to clear up the situation because some didnt like him collaborating with a bigot, which understandable, I dont like Asmon either lol, but if it benefits a game thats good and clears up false rumors/claims about said game, thats good because that game did not deserve what hate it got due to that random doods initial Youtube video.",
