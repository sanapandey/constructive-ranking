I tried looking for ways to stop the corruption to spread to near houses and my world, but the only (fast) solution I could find is the Cleminator, and I have no clue how to get it. I saw another way is to break every block near corruption so that the adjacent blocks don't get corrupted as well, but that's taking a long time and after digging down, it doesn't seem to stop anytime soon.!<  \n  \nIf it matters, since I started I really didn't do much, not any boss, a few NPCs, no hearts and mostly forgetting controls and how stuff worked, I'd really appreciate it if someone would be so kind to give me an idea of what to do, possibly **without spoilers**.  \n  \nThanks again for taking the time to read this",
