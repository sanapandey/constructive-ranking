I don't know what this tendency to look upon kid shows or pretend kid shows aren't kid shows come from but it's been pervasive for the past decade.\n\nShonen Jump demo starts at 10 years old. One Piece is a kids' story, not a small kids' one but a kids' nonetheless. Since it's amazing, we can all enjoy it.",

Nothing to do with CG and only a bit related to budget. Both of these things (cg and budget) are not the biggest issues of OPLA.",
