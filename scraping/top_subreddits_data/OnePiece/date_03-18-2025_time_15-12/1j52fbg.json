Coincidences happen all the time in writing, especially if they add to the symbolism.\n\nFor example, the fact that in Marineford the ship Luffy was on fell into the hole that Jozu made was absolutely a coincidence. Or the fact that Luffy just so happened to infiltrate Impel Down when Buggy was attempting to escape is also coincidence. There's countless similar instances in the manga, so I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss this idea.",

After all, Roscinante once said that aspects like the Will. Of D were told as horror stories, almost like the boogeyman, to him and his brother as kids.\n\nThis is why we get conflicting stories in Elbaph because races like Giants with long life spans are likelier to hear these stories as they bounce around as the generations go on.\n\nThink of the mural and the last part where Nika will destroy the 3rd world. To the characters, it's open-ended; to them, they don't know what that entirely means.\n\n\nAlso, Shamrock does not have a saint title, nor did Doflamingo or Roscinante when they were kids. Very clearly, you do not need to be a Celestial dragon to be a God's Knight, but you probably need to be high up in the government if you are going to be privy to the deep knowledge (remember the one guard who disappeared in whos-whos story).",

He's not JUST a bloodthirsty edgelord, he has some good in him. Good that Luffy saw during his talk with Loki and good that was highlighted by Mossa.",

So its understandable if they have a couple semi top tiers that are capable of possibly capturing a yonko(albeit theyd be hard pressed to capture a yonko with an entire crew of very strong fighters which is why they have so much influence).\n\nLoki gets a pass tho, he kinda reminds me of shiki, got chained up and left there for who knows how long in a country that doesnt really meddle with the rest of the world. The gods knights seem like the ace the government has, I can see why they were needed when it came to facing the rocks crew.",

Like the SHs are definitely going to train more, and get stronger, but I think we're talking about small increases here and there that'll just edge them into victory.\n\nIf there was a whole additional power level tier above Kaido, BM, then why was it so hidden for so long, why was Kaido \"strongest beast\" or WB the \"strongest man alive\". If the God's Knights or IMU or the Gorosei were so strong they could just walk over Kaido then why didn't they stop him before, or Big Mom, or Whitebeard when he attacked Marineford?",

Excited to see more of Loki and the God's Knights abilities, it got wild real fast for all of Elbaph!\n\nOne thing that caught my eye though, is Mr Wolf the PE teacher related to Sanjuan Wolf? I'm still a bit confused if he got attacked by the snake or something else with the kids sleepwalking off. \n\nRegarding Loki, I wonder if his rage towards Luffy will overcome his hatred to what Shamrock did to him. This could be the impetus to have him at least temporarily work with the Straw Hats to drive them off, but I like the setup for multiple enemies at the moment. Will Luffy and everyone in the underworld feel the effects of what's happening above?",

This could explain why they keep giving slaves devil fruits.\n\n\nSo far koala and gunko have a similar design. They both also have a temper. We saw koalas mom was back at home. In the flashback vice admiral strawberry says \"the people on a certain island told us you'd be heading this way\". I had always read it as the people on that island snitched. However that doesn't make sense. They were still on the same island and koalas mom wouldn't have known they were coming. If koalas mom was freed, then it's possible the celestial dragons knew koala would head home. Thus that certain island could have been mariejoa.\n\n\nYou may ask why would a slave become a god knight? And I say this. Look at koalas flashback. Her ingrained behavior was be useful or die. Work or die. If God's knights come from slaves, it would make sense why they are so loyal.",

Corazon already told us that CD children were told boogeyman stories about the Will of D and such. But there have been theories that Gunko isn't a natural-born Celestial Dragon since she wasn't introduced with a Saint title. If that is the case, she wouldn't have grown up with as much indoctrination as born CDs.\n\nPerhaps there's a deeper, more personal reason to Gunko's fear of Nika.",

That's been one of his most consistent character traits over the course of the series such that he's often able to tell that someone is a good person (or at least not a bad person) long before the rest of the crew has, Robin being a prime example. Law too. \n\nAnd now I'm left wondering if Oda is counting on us knowing that about Luffy, and is using that knowledge to pull out the rug from under us. \n\nI mean if there was any character who could fool Luffy's judgement, it would be the character named after the Trickster god right? Of course we don't know what kind of arrangement Luffy and Loki came to so there's still room for this to all turn out alright I suppose but....idk...it feels different this time. \n\nIt's also very interesting how OP Loki's story is mirroring that of the original Loki from Norse Mythology and I'd go as far as to say that the end game of OP itself could be perhaps be inferred based on Loki's story. \n\nOP Loki is hated for killing his father who was revered and beloved by the people of Elbaph, just like how Norse Loki is hated for engineering the death of Baldr who was beloved among gods and mortals. Both Loki's were bound in shackles for these actions. In Norse mythology it is foretold that Loki will break free of these shackles and, with the help of other giants, go to war with the gods. OP Loki has just broken free from his shackles and who does he hate more than anyone? The Celestial Dragons, ie the GODS of the OP world. \n\nGoing even further, OP Loki has stated outright that he will be the one to \"end the world.\" End the world? Well that sounds a hell of a lot like.....Ragnar\u00f6k....the death and rebirth of the world. And you know who is the main instigator of Ragnar\u00f6k in norse mythology? Loki. \n\nSo in short, is the ending of one piece going to be Ragnar\u00f6k??? Are we begining that very process right now with Loki being set free??? I can not wait to see where this is going.",

And now we see loki using ragnir with prolly Coc with seastone and numerous beating to summon lighting is cool.

The city folks promised him a reward but instead, threw him out the town by throwing rocks at him.\n\nThe piper took his revenge by using his flute to hypnotize the town's children and servants, bringing them to a cavern that closed behind them and the town folks never saw them again. My guess is that one of them has a similar ability and does that to capture the children.\n\nI think it's the underwear guy, saint Shepherds. If it's not tied to the story of the piper, I think his ability is about sleeping and dreams / nightmares. He's Saint SHEPHERDS so he makes the children count sheeps and he manipulates their fears through nightmares. It's sleep-related / control related.\n\nOr maybe the nightmare one is Saint Limoshiv Kiringham, his name's actually as an interesting base : the Kirin or Qilin, a mythical creature from the Chinese folklore but also Japanese folklore, also means Giraffe in Japanese... The Qilin is also known as the \"Unicorn that brings children\". It has several versions of the story, one that tells the future of a newborn child with a jade stone, or one where it helps women get pregnant by walking on the footprints of the Qilin.\n\n  \nSo my ultimate theory \"for now\" is that Saint Kiringham has the Mythical Kirin fruit and is able to \"bring forth\" children to him so the kids coming to him is one of his abilities.\n\n  \nBut the sleeping / nightmare one is Saint Shepherds' ability. He may have a \"Sleep Sleep\" fruit or maybe a \"Sheep Sheep\" fruit or something Mythical that is closely tied to sleeping and dreams.",

Nika is shown with a sword and shield; Shamrock and Shanks's swords, Cerberus and Griffon, would serve as Emu's sword and shield in the hands of Vista, whose dual-wielded swords resemble those of Shanks's and Shamrock. Therefore the one to defeat Emu will actually be Mihawk, which would then make Buggy the Pirate King while Luffy fails and dies.\n\nAs Buggy was the overlooked younger sibling to Shanks, the only logical and narratively satisfying conclusion is for him to blow past everyone's expectations and succeed where his captain failed.

Plus the reason why toki came to the future would be to chase after Gunko.\n\nBut i havent come up with a theory as to why toki would send Gunko to the future.\n\nSo yeah, im not convinced myself but i had fun thinking about it",
