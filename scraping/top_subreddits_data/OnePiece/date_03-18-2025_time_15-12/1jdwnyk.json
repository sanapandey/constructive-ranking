    "selftext": "Zoro is so determined to be the strongest swordsman in the world that he instinctively walks towards who he has to beat to achieve that goal, Which is Mihawk. \nHe has a built in compass to always point towards the strongest. All he did from childhood is look for Train and look for Mihawk so that he could beat him. And for that reason we saw mihawk so early in the series because zoro is always on the path of the strongest swordsman in the world.\nMihawk is like a magnet for Zoro.\nI bet zoro gonna get better navigation skills than nami after he defeats Mihawk and become the best in the world.",

If Ussop can survive getting his skull bashed in multiple times during the show.\nThen a character who's relatively strong for her age and has trained in swordsmanship all her life should be able to survive falling down the stairs.\n\nZoro's backstory is one of the weaker ones anyway.
