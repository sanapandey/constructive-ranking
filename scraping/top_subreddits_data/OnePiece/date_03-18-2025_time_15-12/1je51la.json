He never lost, and he had weak willpower because he didn't like the pirate life. Meaning his potential is not well defined yet. But they should only make him as strong as Usopp. \nArlong and Krieg were basically at their max potential, so giving them haki is more of a stretch, especially when you consider how many strawhats don't have haki yet. That's my head cannon since Kuro was my fav villain in early OP.",
