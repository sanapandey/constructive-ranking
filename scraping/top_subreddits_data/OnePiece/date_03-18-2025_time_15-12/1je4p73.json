    "selftext": "\"I saw this on YouTube a while back. To forge a permanently black blade, a swordsman must possess a powerful swordsman's will \u2013 for example, Zoro's Demon Ashura \u2013 and must have mastered Conqueror's Haki. Once these conditions are met, the swordsman can use their kingly will to command their swordsman's will, infusing it into one of their blades and making it permanently black.\" Here the link to the video on YouTube https://youtube.com/shorts/5LmsOSU-kz8?si=oYYSBtpJQgmEEooe",

You can also throw Shanks in the mix too as a person without a black blade yet has some of the strongest haki in the verse.\n\nIt's pretty clear we are missing a major component beyond just haki and overall strength. Otherwise why would only Ryuma and Mihawk be able to accomplish this?",

Honestly, I don't have a full theory for Roger / Rayleigh outside of the fact that we should look into the things Zoro or Mihawk wanted to cut vs having more cutting POWER (if this makes sense).  Did Roger want to be stronger with more power, or do the literal impossible which is what Mihawk and now Zoro are doing?",

Even if Oden hadnt mastered ACoC until Kaido it still wouldnt explain Roger who did master it since we saw him use it against WB. It also wouldnt explain Shanks either. \n\nI have my reservations that its a power issue, because then all you'd need to forge one is more training and better haki and its hard to imagine the names we're dropping didnt reach the pinnacle of that. \n\nOne thing that would serve as a great hint to this would be to know when exactly Mihawk forged his black blade, was it during the Shanks duels? or after? Theres a missing piece here somewhere.\n\nI will say the notion you brought up of them wanting to cut something **greater** is an interesting one.",

                    "body": "If I had to guess, it's a mix of supreme control of armament haki, very strong conquerer's haki, *and* an ungodly single minded determination toward being the best swordsman. Shanks, Rayleigh, Oden and Roger all have/had incredibly strong conquerer's haki, and likely were good enough at armament haki to infuse their blades, but they all had goals that weren't \"be the best swordsman there is\". Shanks and Roger want/wanted to be the pirate king, Rayleigh had to be first mate and presumably look after everyone else on the crew, Oden was seeking to eventually return to Wano.\n\nRyuma, Hawkeye, and Zoro are different, because being the best swordsman in the world and constantly improving this one specific craft is their primary goal. They'll do other stuff to help achieve that, like Hawkeye being a warlord and Zoro joining Luffy, but ultimately being the best is the end goal they're trying to achieve. \n\nIn material terms, it gives these guys stronger reason to infuse their swords often, and get skilled specifically at doing so, as well for them to use the same swords for long periods of time. If the Merry taught us anything, it's that traveling with and caring for an object can give the object properties beyond what it \"should\" be able to do. I can imagine that using the same sword for a long time, constantly infusing it, and getting good at infusing it can lead to the haki getting \"set\" in the blade, making it black.\n\nTo be clear, I don't remember enough about what they've specifically said about black blades to know if there's specific textual evidence for this, but it feels like a good thematic reason for ryuma/mihawk to have a black blade where the other people listed don't.",

Also dont forget that Oden had already forced Enma to submit to him, he had mastered that blade yet it never became a black blade.",

Making the metal tungsten like in color and durability by it being hardened by the haki.

This is where comprehension really kicks in because there are different hakis.\n\n- Rayleigh in this panel displays Advanced CoA to Luffy, which can be used to attack people from a distance. That haki is invisible and Luffy doesnt actually learn it until Wano where its still invisible.\n- Basic CoA has an invisible variant which Luffy uses when he grabs Ceasar the first time with Robin/Franky.\n- When characters harden themselves its visible which is where the black hue comes from. This is not just for the reader, characters see it too. (Law in chapter 690 sees Vergo's full haki coating / Luffy in chapter 1140 sees the haki being used on the key).\n\nRayleigh is not wrong in this panel because the haki he shows is advanced and is invisible but hardened CoA is visible, it also has an invisible weaker variant.",
