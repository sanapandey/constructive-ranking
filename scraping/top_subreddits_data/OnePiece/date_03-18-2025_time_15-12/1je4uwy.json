Gillingham puts Sommers to sleep and extracts salt from his dream.\n\nBack to Loki and Luffy's group:\n\n- Luffy punches Loki lightly, yet Loki immediately faints.\n- Zoro observes that Loki was already severely weakened and near death before Luffy hit him.\n- Luffy asks Gerth to treat Loki's injuries:\n\n- Gerth initially resists due to resentment but eventually agrees to help him.\n\nFlashback (Hajrudin\u2019s Past):\n\n- Loki is shown to have bullied Hajrudin since childhood.\n- Hajrudin seeks revenge against Loki, believing Loki murdered their father.\n\n- Loki awakens and dramatically states:\n\u201cDo you really think I killed Father because I wanted to? I know you don't believe that either.\u201d\n\nNo break announced. Full summary to follow.",

So this means either they dream stuff lasts until the person stops thinking about it or that Gillingham can literally create things from people's dreams.  \n\nI'm starting to think that Sommers will be a Sanji opponent. \n\nEveryone called it, Loki didn't just kill the king for no reason. It was likely out of self defense, it was likely Loki saw the King handing the children of Elbaph to the Holy Knights which was vaguely alluded to by the one connecting the thread or-- Jarul. Being alive while Mother Caramel was doing it and being present at the castle during the fight. And the fact that one of the first things Sommers talks to Shamrock is visiting Haralds grave. \n\nEither way it's gonna be interesting",

Strength of the thorns is proportional to the bond between kidnapped and saver. such a random fruit! what about if people attack sommer directly? what if people save the kidnapee but they have no bond? what if the revolutionary army came to save the kids? they have no love for those particular kids, so they wont be stung by the thorns? \n\nhow can anybody even dream of such a power to make it materialize as a DF?",

He is a member of the God's Knights he probably already has OP strength, Haki, Durability etc. He probably already can cut a ship in half using his bare strength.\n\nBut his fruit? Now that's horrible. Essentially your allies become your worst nightmare. Imagine he fights someone who is stronger than him( which let's be honest in the whole world there is maybe 100 people stronger than a freaking God Knight, who also happens to be a celestial dragon with unlimited wealth and resources) he can't beat them BUT he can attack their closest allies, family, etc. And you can't even save them! We don't know how the fruit works but I'm assuming he can also create thorns at will and mark everything with his thorn ability, example: You are a swordsman( you obviously love your sword) he hits your sword and now guess what, thorn sword you cant wield! The fact his df works remotely( according to the spoilers) makes it one of the most OP. You have treasure, boom people try to steal it and guess what...THORNS( if you are a thief, you love money trust me.) Your wife was stolen by Sommers and you tried to help her escape, boom thorns, now you dead.\n\nLowkey his fruit is totally fitting for a World Noble tbh.",
