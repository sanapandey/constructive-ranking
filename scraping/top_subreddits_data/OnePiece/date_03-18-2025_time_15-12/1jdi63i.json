In the past, when it was his life, he said Luffy will be KOP like in Alabasta\n\nbut this time around it was Nami's and he won't force his ideals on his friend or just watch her die.",

At such a young age, he witnessed people ridiculing Roger and hearing them say that Roger is evil, wrathful, and that if he has any kin, they would be more than happy to kill them just by sharing a bond/blood with Roger. \n\nThe reason why Ace disliked everyone except Sabo is because he assumes people will start hating him the moment they knew about his real identity. Even Dadan herself has told him that if Roger has a child, they will automatically hate that person. He literally asked Luffy if Luffy is glad that he's around in which Luffy replied positively so that's why he started liking Luffy.\n\nFor Ace, having a father figure was as important to him as his own life whom he thought was worthless. When Whitebeard took him as a member, he tried to kill WB 100 times before mellowing out and confessing that he was Roger's son. Expecting rejection, Whitebeard actually just set it aside and told him that he loved his crew, his sons, equally so that's when Ace started liking WB and eventually became one of his most loyal members. Ace became too loyal to WB that he personally went out to sea to bring Blackbeard to justice for breaking the only law in their ship and smearing Whitebeard's name.\n\n Remember Ace intially dreaming of becoming Pirate King? He gave up all that to make Whitebeard the Pirate King instead. So when Akainu started dissing Whitebeard in front of him, Ace just couldnt hold back himself from getting baited. This is a guy who put all his stake in Whitebeard, his acknowledged father figure. His reaction to Akainu's provocation might be foolish to some but for Ace, it was like disrespecting everything that he stands for. All his life he was denied of a father growing up and now that he has one which he even gave up his dream on to make that person \"realize\" theirs (he has always thought Whitebeard wanted to be Pirate King), someone then goads him by badmouthing the person he looks up to the most. It was understandable Ace has lost it right then and there and paid the price with his life.",

It is then the root cause why he sought out Blackbeard despite his crewmates and Whitebeard advising against it as BB breaking the one rule in their ship and getting away with it was like a spit to Whitebeard's name. It has then resulted in his eventual defeat and eventual execution. Ultimately, it was the reason why he had gone back and risked everything.\n\nAce knew Whitebeard was already planning to die in Marineford so hearing Akainu badmouthing WB's legacy just didnt sit well with him. He couldnt let go such disrespect to his dying father's name. I guess people who could understand Ace the most are people who have a father/mother/brother/sister figure in their life that they love and highly respects.",

The problem isn\u2019t that you\u2019re thinking it. The problem would be if you acted out on it and let your worst tendencies win over. Again, I don\u2019t even agree that this is what it was, but for the sake of argument, Usopp didn\u2019t even do anything here that would have changed the course of the plot in any way considering that no one else could have heard him.",

Like Usopp and Nami specifically have always had a strong friendship. Obviously all of the crew like each other, even Zoro and Sanji do deep down, everyone in the crew has distinc relationships with each other and Nami and Usopp are clearly ment to be very close friends. They (alongside Chopper) are the cowards of the crew. They get scared when everybody else gets excited, they understand each other and because of that they grew close. Having Usopp tell any crew member to sacrifice themselves would be bad, but like it would be less bad if it where, say, Luffy or Sanji or Zoro, he'll even Franky or Brook. One of the head strong people who are known to rush into danger easily, one's who regularly try to get themselves killed anyway. But to tell that to Nami, his fellow coward, just kinda makes him come off like an asshole.\n\nAnd even putting all that aside, the most satisfying part of that moment was having Nami herself be the one to do it. We like Usopps moment in Alabasta so much because that is him making the decision to piss off the enemy even more all so he could stand up for his friend, it was a strong moment of courage for a known coward. And as mentioned above, Nami is also famous for being one of the crews cowards, so having her be willing to risk her own life for Luffy is what makes the moment great. If she had a friend in the background peer preasuring her into doing it the moment simply doesn't hit as hard. It has to be Nami and Nami alone that makes that decision.",

At best that's head canon, but again, if we are going for comparations that would be like saying Zoro wouldn't have killed Orochi if given the chance, cause he's too weak... It in a more canonical note all the gifters he slashed during Wano.\n\n\nIm not gonna touch the stuff you wrote about family dynamics cause is one step away from what you'd find in a christian add from the 80s. But I disagree fundamentally with the idea you'd worry less if your older siblings are about to die than if your younger one was. \n\n\nNami ain't the little sister tho, she ain't a kid, and the problem is that he treats her like one, you can say x is stronger or weaker but in terms of relationship  they're equal. And treating her as the \"younger sister\" when she has proven time and time again to be able to sit in the grown up table, even more than Usopp has btw, is bs. There's no reason for that condescension other than \"she a girl\". It's that lack of respect of condescending her own determination, treating her as a child when she clearly has the feats to show otherwise.",

Oda kind of fails to write Usopp correctly, which is where a lot of the hatred and/or confusion comes from.\n\nHe said in Water 7 that he would never again fail them. Then he said it again during the time skip.\n\nThen he said it again on Fishman Island.\n\nThen he said it again in Dressrosa.\n\nThen he sa...\n\nYou get the point.\n\nWater 7 to Enies Lobby is his growth moment, and we're hoping he's going to be taking the grand line more seriously and start acting like he's a member of the Pirate King's crew and he just...doesn't. He's always lagging behind the rest of the crew. Which would be fine if it wasn't *literally the entire point of him leaving the crew in Water 7* to begin with. That whole arc was about him finding his courage in himself again...and then he just keeps losing it over and over, and not in a satisfying \"it takes time to be brave\" sort of way - he NEVER experiences any sort of permanent character growth. His growth is entirely confined to each arc, and then regresses back to \"old Usopp\" at the beginning of the next arc.\n\nTake Dressrosa: Usopp has the potential to absolutely BODY Trebol if he would have trained properly and taken things more seriously, but instead he just wants to goof off with his friends, and they pay the price for it. It isn't that people who criticize these moments think he should have turned around and died, we think *he shouldn't have been in that weak position to begin with*. Usopp has monster trio potential, he truly does. But he squanders it. We've seen him tank hits that Zoro would have struggled with numerous times (he comes out beaten and battered but *still survives*), the story has also made a point to show us he's basically in the top 5 of sniper skill in the OP universe...and then Oda just never really capitalizes off of that.\n\nOda is constantly putting him in that weak position so he can serve the narrative purpose of \"courage of the weak\", but it just ends up getting tired after a while because we know that any growth he experiences will immediately be ret-conned in the next arc when he has to play the fool again.\n\nIt's similar to Vegeta serving as a jobber to Goku. Vegeta is shown as strong, gets beaten by a big bad so we can accurately gauge their strength when Goku ultimately defeats them. DBZ/S is constantly criticized for this trope. It's the same concept with Usopp.",

And talk-no-jutsu to the samurai in the raid and a few other minor details.\n\nThis is *not* \"what he can do.\" It's literally not. We've seen what he's capable of, he's not meeting his potential.

It makes perfect sense, but it's unnecessary at the same time. Maybe the idea was to make the reader think Nami would actually say it? It's the only reason I can think of to not leave him out of this. \n\nEither way it feels like the page and scene would've worked a lot better if Ussop just didn't even add his 2 cents and let this be a Nami only moment, it didn't seem to add much besides the obvious (that he cares about her more than he cares about shouting Luffy's dream, duh, surprise to no one).

I'm not asking usopp to be up on the rooftop fighting kaido, I'm asking usopp to consistently stand up for himself and his crew rather than in specific moments. I don't like seeing usopp only fight for what he believes in when his life is in danger. you know a character that takes the idea of cowardice and does it better? nami. nami is with usopp nearly every arc and they always freak out together, but nami is always the one who wants to act while usopp wants to run. nami wants to push through that fear no matter what rather than usopp only sometimes pushing through the fear.",
