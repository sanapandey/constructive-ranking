I find that hard to believe.\n\nI think it's more likely that there is some folk legend about a sleeping kirin that you and I are simply unaware of.",

If Bonney gets involved we might see a fucked up Saturn one more time, too.  That would be fun (especially if she manages to beat it without Luffy's help this time.)\n\nWhether I stick hard to my theory is gonna depend on what Sommers' fruit is...

For me, that sufficiently explains their prevalence among the world nobles without the need to invoke additional theories.\n\nAs for the ink fruit theory, I'm really not convinced. There's absolutely no good evidence for it, and I it just doesn't feel right to me. Maybe I'll be proved wrong though",

That leaves the above 3 to think about.\n\nWe know it can't be a *teleporter power* specifically, since that doesn't account for the other two options.  It could be something like a Magic-Magic or Sorcerer-Sorcerer power, but that seems kind of off, I wouldn't really expect it.\n\nThe other option besides Ink-Ink that I think is pretty plausible with our current information is Devil-Devil, and I can see the value of the wordplay.  Deals with the devil, the appearance of a huge devil in the Adam mural, and teleportation through a dark abyss all make sense here.\n\nI personally prefer Ink-Ink because it'll make an awesome fight against Luffy's Nika, and because Ink powers would be the perfect fit for someone who wishes to >!redact!< a period of history, which is Imu's primary villainous trait.  Ink can also be used to write all manner of spells, which would explain the dark-magic theming there's been lately, and to write contracts, which could loop back to the deal with a devil thing.\n\nCould also just be some kind of original god unique to the mythos but I hope not.",

But now I find my self wondering if the ship that they are talking about has already arrived or if they will still have to wait for the ships that will help them carry out their plans to arrive at the shores of the island of warrior giants.\n\nI also enjoyed the way that the three members of the Gods Knights interacted with each other.
