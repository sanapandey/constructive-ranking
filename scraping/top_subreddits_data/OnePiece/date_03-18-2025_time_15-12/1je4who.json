If he didn\u2019t have a sword, I\u2019d lock him in. \n\nKilingham is interesting. This will be the only Dragon Dragon fruit user which is mythical. And that power is pretty interesting to boot. So not only can it put you to sleep, it can materialize your dreams. Nightmares up to something as simple as salt. He will be interesting to fight. I assume the haki of the Monster Trio and Luffy will keep him from using the fruit on them directly during combat, but materializing someone else\u2019s dream and using it in combat could still be busted. \n\nLoki being sonned like that so early was not on my radar. Luffy seemingly didn\u2019t hesitate. Just immediately one tapped him and then called for a doctor. And with Loki revealing that he didn\u2019t want to kill his father we have essentially 100% confirmation that Harold was a bad guy.

With the way that he was described to be taken by Luffy's \"weak attack\", its being made obvious that he's in condition to have a serious battle at this moment in time.\n\nIt also makes sense that Hajrudin would have a biased view towards Loki given his behaviour towards him, but the line at the end from Loki towards Hajrudin about killing his father potentially because he had no choice does ask questions on several things.\n\nThe circumstances of who Harold was and how he died.\n\nLokis full nature as a person and what he thought of his father.\n\nAnd if there were other parties involved in Harold's demise (HKs)",

I though the \u201cNightmare fruit\u201d was an ideal fight for Usopp, but now that we know it\u2019s user is the CD with a similar demeanour to Usopp and not Sommers I really think it\u2019s the fight Oda\u2019s building to.\n\nIf Sommers is not the main \u201cboss\u201d of this arc, his fruit makes him a great Sanji opponent. Sanji\u2019s already been brought up as one of Luffy\u2019s \u201cwings\u201d and the fruit\u2019s power being based on the opponent\u2019s LOVE combined with Sanji having exclusively close-ranged attacks makes him and ideal opponent to develop Sanji.\n\nGunko\u2019s still up in the air, but she might just be Nami\u2019s opponent judging from Oda\u2019s track record",
