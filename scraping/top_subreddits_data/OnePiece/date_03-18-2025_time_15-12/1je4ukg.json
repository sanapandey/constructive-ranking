He didn't train every night like koby did, so it's natural for him to be weaker.\u00a0\n\n\nNot saying it's not just plot and koby being the more significant character, that is absolutely the case. But in-universe it makes sense as well. Both trained under Garp, but koby additionally did an excercise garp and aokiji did during nights.\u00a0\n\n\nKoby might canonically be the one who trained the most per day in the verse when it comes to fighting since he trained day and night (not the whole night probably but definitely several hours). Maybe sanji comes close but it's kinda vague for him, since he was running away a lot and not practicing attacks\n\n\nIg this is oda's try to justify his last and probably future very big and abrupt power-ups",
