    "selftext": "Blackbeard's power has a some inconsistencies with what we know of Logia fruits.\n\nPrimarily, his body isn't intangible. He chocks it up to the unique nature of a black hole. But, consider that he's mistaken about the identity of his Yami-Yami No Mi. Just like Luffy with his Gomu-Gomu No Mi.\n\nHis knowledge of the fruit presumably stems from the Devil Fruit Encyclopedia, which we now know includes intentional misinformation  \nAbout the Hito-Hito No Mi [Mythical Model Nika].\n\nNow I wonder if that's the only Devil Fruit to be renamed. Suppose Imu had other Fruits from history they needed expunged.\n\nI'm wondering if the Yami-Yami is also a Zoan, \nSomething like a Moon God or Devil\n\nMy best guess would be Beelzebub, specifically the demon of Gluttony from Christian lore. It fits Blackbeard's Greed & lack of self control.\n\nApologies if this theory has already been made, it's the first I've shared.\n\n\n\n",

            "body": "I think that it is a logia. The problem is that it has a weakness. Like water for Crocodile (sand) and Luffy/rubber for Enel (electricity), the weakness makes them tangible. Blackbeard's problem is that his weakness is light. And light is everywhere, so he's always tangible. The only exception we've seen is when he covers himself and Whitebeard at Marineford. Blackbeard doesn't strike me as somebody who wants or needs privacy to do his thing, so I think the covering was necessary. \n\nI'm sure we'll get answers one way or another eventually and I can't wait!",

BB is darkness since stuff is absorbed inside him and darkness is an element as much as light or snow is.\n\nKatakuri's intangibility and embodiment of Mochi didn't make him a logia, so I don't think BB's apparent lack of intangibility makes him not one.

It's already a bit weird that they wouldn't go after Luffy as soon as they heard about a Gomu Gomu no Mi user with a Strawhat telling everyone he wants to be king of the pirates, but whatever, I can accept that.\n\nHowever, I hope it stays an exception. I've seen too many theories lately about how \"X fruit is actually a mythical Zoan\". Chopper, Robin, Brook, Blackbeard... But you have to remember that every time Oda will try to introduce a new \"miscategorized\" fruit, he will have to explain why it happened. And I'm not sure I'd like the WG to be SO incompetent that they not only blundered with Nika but with every fruit they tried to erase from history.\n\nSo I hope it stays like Katakuri's fruit.

Especially considering Luffy\u2019s and Black Beards inherent reactions to each other. The unknown sun god and the god of darkness being oil and water for each other.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m an idiot. I didn\u2019t expand on my original theory. Apophis being the god of chaos, darkness and earthquakes. The original devil fruit may have inherently come with minor versions of those two fruits. And by Blackbeard consuming the fully realized versions of those devil fruits he enhanced his own abilities already granted by his original devil fruit. \n\nTake for example Luffy, if there is an actual Gomu gomu no mi, he would likely get even greater rubber like powers due to the rubber already being connected to his Zoan fruit. Something along the lines of plastic man being able to shape his body however he wants. \n\nThe hebi hebi no mi model Apophis also helps to explain the \u201cstrangeness\u201d of Black Beards body which was reported before he ever got his hands on the Yami Yami no mi.

We don't know why he knows stuff because we don't know his past, there's no need for a supernatural explanation and honestly it would be kind of disappointing. What is more interesting: He has a motivation deeply tied to his past, rooted in History that grants him knowledge and that's also why Oda said his job would be archaeologist in the real world, or \"I learned it all from eating a weird fruit\".",

If one zoan fruit makes you a rubber man, there may as well be one that turns you into mochi. Maybe a god of food or celebration or something. Might be a god of family like Hestia, use the mochi to stick people together both literally and through familial bonds.
