If you're not a member of the club now, you never will be. And I know you're not a member of the club because you're not billionaires.\n\nYou've been swindled. There is no winning in a system like that. You will lose even more than the libs you so desperately want to own and blame all your life's problems on.",

Instead, she is warning the public of a potential outcome, one which ALL indicators seem to be pointing too, that is antithetical to the American political experience. \n\nFurthermore, manufacturing consent has, as necessary conditions, the five following filters that serve to narrow the range of discourse:\n\n* **Ownership of the Media** \u2013 Major media outlets are owned by large corporations that have financial and political interests. Their content tends to align with the perspectives of corporate elites.\n* **Advertising as a Primary Revenue Source** \u2013 Media depends on advertisers for funding, leading to a bias toward content that pleases corporate sponsors and avoids topics that might challenge their interests.\n* **Sourcing of News** \u2013 News organizations rely on government agencies, corporations, and elite think tanks for information, reinforcing official narratives while marginalizing alternative perspectives.\n* **Flak and the Disciplining of the Media** \u2013 Negative responses (e.g., lawsuits, political pressure, corporate boycotts) discourage journalists and outlets from challenging dominant power structures.\n*  **Ideological Control Mechanisms** \u2013 During the Cold War, anti-communism was a dominant ideology used to discredit dissent. Today, other ideological frames (e.g., the \"war on terror,\" nationalism, or economic neoliberalism) serve similar functions in shaping public opinion.\n\nWhat is happening in America right now fits the definition of manufacturing consent. Trumps road to his second election win, fits the definition of manufacturing consent. Trump's reliance on executive order after executive order fits the definition of manufacturing consent. ALL of Trumps actions serve to manufacture consent. Please spare me.",

Trump is following the same game plan that Orban is using to replace democracy with authoritarianism that pretends to be a democracy. \n\nOf course we'll still have elections, but the question is whether we'll still be a functional democracy.",
