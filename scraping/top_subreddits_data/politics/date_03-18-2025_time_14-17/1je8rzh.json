Reality is, a chunk of the country are idiots and a lot of them voted for this. Liberals try too hard to make sure that everything they\u2019re saying is smart, explains everything in detail, and uses words beyond a 6th grade reading level. Even if you\u2019re humble enough to know that you\u2019re not truly smart and don\u2019t know everything, people still don\u2019t like to feel like they\u2019re stupid so the people that show their intellect inadvertently pushes away those without it, it\u2019s why nerds have always been a punching bag in comedy.\n\nJust like how I need to dumb down what I say and get to the point, a lot of liberal leaders and politicians need to as well. MAGA is four words that describe their movement, unity, and goal (even if it\u2019s a load of farce), what is our equivalent?  Bernie is an example of someone that can speak to a mass amount of people without them needing a great education and inspire them, he railed my Highschool and we couldn\u2019t even vote yet. AOC is also young enough to capture attention with her words, she doesn\u2019t sound like your mom nagging you about something you did wrong.",

Terrible content. \n\nNothing feels more constructed and artificial than the push and \u201csuccess\u201d of this podcast that I see constant articles and news stories about.

I sort of get why some people want content like that, especially people who struggle to read news for whatever reason (and there are legit reasons for that, I know lots of folks who have trouble with long-form written content for accessibility reasons), and who may need that \"here is a summary of the dumb bullshit that happened today\" kind of form. BUT, their actual long-form episodes are pretty great and I enjoy listening to them. There aren't enough podcasters doing work in that space imo, and maybe it's because the appetite isn't there for long-form content as much as it used to be (which I personally find frustrating, but it is what it is I guess). Their full-length episodes are good listening, imo. \n\nEven their \"play that clip\" news to me is reminiscent of NPR/NYT and the way they do news breakdowns, which I also hate, but that's also why I figure I'm kind of biased against that format to begin with.",
