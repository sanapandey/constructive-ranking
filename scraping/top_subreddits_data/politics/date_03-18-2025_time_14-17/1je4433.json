Theres not a lot of constitutional or legal basis for it, and what basis does exist allows for both Congress and the President to exercise or cancel it, largely as a result of court precedent.

In the current climate, that hope basically turns into wishful thinking, because not only would a judge have to decide to involve marshalls, but the marshalls would have to actually comply ignoring their orders from the doj, and then the Trump admin would have not to use force.\n\n\nBut don't take it from me, [take it from a former federal judge](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5292199/retired-federal-judge-nancy-gertner-trump-federal-funding-freeze-restraining-order) :\n\n\n>\u00a0Nancy Gertner: The court, a judge has said, has tools available to him or her in the first instance. They can cite the parties in front of them for contempt. They can impose fines, of course, since one of the parties\u2014arguably, here, Elon Musk\u2014it's not clear that fines are going to make a particle of a difference. There's even the possibility of imprisoning someone until the order is followed. All of these are obviously empty threats with respect to the defendants in this case. The marshals would have to enforce whatever orders the judge entered. The problem is that the Marshal Service is under the Department of Justice, and if Trump wanted to fully not comply, he could direct the Department of Justice not to comply.",
