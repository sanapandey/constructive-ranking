However, Trump in his first term managed to show America\u2019s allies that the US can no longer be trusted regardless of who\u2019s in the White House. Up until Trump, the US was seen internationally as a strong and incredible reliable ally, regardless of who was in charge. Then Trump managed to undo that within less than two years into his first term. Biden did normalise relations again, but the damage was done, because now the world knew that it did in fact depend on who was in charge. The world\u2019s observation was confirmed by Trump\u2019s victory in November last year. GWB did a fuckton of damage. Trump managed to end America\u2019s standing on the international stage, something the US will not be able to recover from for decades, if ever. More likely the rebuilding of this trust would require a constitutional reform in the US, because we\u2019ve all seen now that a constitution that\u2019s build on a system of trust an honour cannot be trusted.",

Two terms of normalcy would've done a lot to repair our standing. And it likely would've meant Trump likely would never return to the Oval Office. Look at our standing after Obama.\n\n>More likely the rebuilding of this trust would require a constitutional reform in the US\n\nIt's only been a short time. Much of the world is waiting to see if any of our checks and balances work. They won't, sadly. So, you are correct here. The world is going to want to see some internal guarantees that this can't happen again.",

And it looks nice, high budget, great actors all around. But, spoilers ahead for something that happens about halfway through the show, at one point kind of a Ben Shapiro + Alex Jones mixture type  internet media commentator is goading the President to arrest him. And the President does, sends jackbooted ski-mask guys in the middle of the night and takes him to a secret prison where De Niro gets in his face and says \"Who's laughing now?\" And my first thought was \"man I sure hope Trump doesn't see this.\" \n\nGranted, I don't think Trump has the attention span or mental capacity to watch *any* show or movie. But it really sent chills down my spine knowing the writers wrote this as some huge abuse of power, and now that's just fully on the table. \n\nIf I were Kinzinger I'd watch my back, there does not seem to be a line these psychos in power won't cross.
