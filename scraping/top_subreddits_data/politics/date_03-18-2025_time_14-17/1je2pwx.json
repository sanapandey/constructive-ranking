Anything bad he says is a joke.\n\n* If I criticize Trump, I must believe my mother is stupid. \n\n* If I insult Trump, I hate my family. And God. And I am going to hell. \n\nAnd I was like \"Oh that's nice.\" and went back to eating breakfast.\n\nThe brainwashing is real, my friends.",

The gist was that religious organizations send their followers out into the world to \"share the word\" not with the intent of bringing in new followers, but instead keeping the existing followers in the \"flock.\" The thinking being that when these people go out into the world, they face criticism and derision. They then bring these experiences back to their congregation, which validates their experience and gives them the message \"See, it's scary out there. But you're safe here with us.\" \n\nTl;dr: Proselytizing exists to other outsiders, not bring them in.",

Here's [a really interesting report that details their methods](https://2017-2021.state.gov/russias-pillars-of-disinformation-and-propaganda-report/) written by our own US department of state. They have a state agency (the Internet Research Agency) that is a branch of the Kremlin that does nothing but post on social media across the globe with intentional misinformation. Professional trolls, hundreds of them, part of a comprehensive and long-term plan to interfere with elections all over the planet. \n\nIt's depressing that humans spend this much time and effort to make each other's lives worse, but you're right - it will be studied. Probably to learn how to do it *better*.",

They decide a person is good or bad, then assign that judgment to every statement & behavior of that person.

The actions don't matter, morality doesn't matter, they're allowed and we are not because they are good and we are bad. Truth, lies, patriotism, religion, morality, none of it actually matters to them they're all just weapons to beat \"the enemy\" with. And they've been programmed to believe the enemy is their fellow Americans and, largely, the American government.

It's easier to see from the outside when you only see it once in a while. When Trump hit East Kentucky Appalachia, he promised coal jobs back, an economy revived like never seen before. Hard working proud mountain people who go to church every Sunday, believed the fairy tale,....--in 2016, in 2020, in 2024. \n\nIt is something inherently natural in humans to want to believe the nice and pretty. The people are finally beginning to see the cracks in the plaster, but even with that, they still hang onto the lies. My immediate family moved out of the coalfields before I was born. Daddy worked hard, got an education and furnished for us with a comfortable lifestyle in comparison to what was left behind. I started working when was 14 part time to buy clothes that weren't hand me downs. I have worked my entire life, half of it spent in the Army.\n\nI see young people bitching and complaining about no money, but spending half of the day playing video games. If you want it, do like did and get that second job. Many of my friends also held second jobs until they were in their forties. Don't go buy a new car. A used one served our family fine until after I retired from the military. \n\nIt bothers me to pay for all of the people on \"welfare\" who do nothing to improve their lot. It bothers me that young people somehow believe I owe it to them to feed and house them. I absolutely feel entitled to my retirement. I am almost 70 now. I earned what I get and what I have accumulated over the years. We offer help from our church to drug/ alcohol dependent people to become sober if they want to work at that. Those folks at the store with that EBT government card are really proud of that red hat. \n\nThe cult is insane. People waited and listened to the lies when trump got elected the first time. Trump kept making promises and those hard working mountain folk kept believing. They still believe some sort of miracle is going to give them all jobs again. It isn't.",

Now we\u2019ve got Trump, Elon, Miller, and a clown car of a cabinet dismantling 75 years of American social norms and global politics.",

Capitalism has made education a factory that produces a specific type of product. Naturally many people will not fit that product mold. Our society has devalued the dignity of work and the result is people who don't feel valued, hence the tension between \"smart\" and \"dumb\". The GOP leveraged this in their messaging over the last 20 years and as a result won the demographic of people making under 100k.  This failure falls squarely at the feet of Democratic leadership and their inability to craft a compelling counter narrative. \n\nIMO, the \"smart\" vs. \"dumb\" thing is a manufactured narrative that forces people to view \"success\" in extremely narrow terms. This is then reinforced by inequality, which makes people believe they are \"dumb\", resent people who are \"smart\" and creates a society that has no communal sense of shared success.",

The 90s is cool, but most of us were children during that too.

They voted for the boogeyman who wants them to work until they die. Or just die, depending on who is talking and to what audience. We were always told we'd never be able to retire.",

He's still full of hate and anger, and he supports a guy who 100% would have me killed for my political beliefs if he had the chance. \n\nI just don't know how to go about cutting him off.

A family member of mine and I were discussing various politicians across the political spectrum- mostly complaints, I dont think either of us have a decent view of 99% or more of politicians (and I doubt we're alone on that). But I of course take more issue with one particular side of the aisle; when I called Trump an idiot, though, my family member literally reacted as though I had physically struck him. We went from shooting the shit and complaining about all politicians to him being visibly upset and practically on the verge of angry tears that I held this viewpoint. \n\nThey are being programmed to believe this imbecile is a perfect angel of vengeance against the libs. This shit is incredibly dangerous and we need targeted de-cultification ASAP for tens of millions of people, a feat which I just don't see us pulling off in time.\n\nIf I had been Biden, I would've done a series of fireside chats when I was newly in the presidency, gently explaining some of the topics that Trump uses as his primary talking points, and going through them. Discussing some of the logical fallacies employed by his team. And appealing from the bottom of my heart to all Americans to be their best selves. And in between all that, I'd be reading right out of the \"how to reprogram cultists\" textbook. Surely most wouldn't listen or even see it. But I'd probably get to SOME. It feels like we mostly sat on our hands for four years and watched democracy die.",

                    "body": "I had a similar experience with my mom recently - she\u2019s a total trump-nut - she was so happy when he won again - talking about how everyone\u2019s taxes will go down and things will be safe once we deport all \u201cthem\u201d immigrants. After I got done choking on my coffee I pointed out that her life savings was not enough to live on and that her SS check each month is her life line. I asked how was she planning to eat when they took away her Medicare and SS (because you know those liberal programs don\u2019t help anybody). Now this was December just before Xmas - I was obviously a misinformed left wing nut - she loves me but thinks I\u2019ve strayed - and there\u2019s no way that Trump (who just LOVES the common man - her words not mine) would ever touch those programs because - wait for it - because he said he wouldn\u2019t. Well fuck me - who would have guessed that Trump never lies or breaks his word - it just could not be.\n\nFast forward 2 months - I was just on the phone with her and the doom was starting to set in - her state legislature is talking about serious reductions in Medicare if the Feds cut their portion. She\u2019s pushing 85, mostly healthy but seriously she is 85, things are broken that are kept in check with healthcare. The light isn\u2019t completely on - she\u2019s currently upset that Musk is breaking this stuff and isn\u2019t sure why his highness the Orange Tvrd has not put a stop to it. I also asked what her plan was went her SS checks stopped coming? (The line went dead - guess she\u2019s not entirely on board yet)\n\nMy mother is a retired professional, educated, and (used to be) middle of the road politically. Then she retired, and every waking moment Fox News is on the TV - it\u2019s not that she\u2019s watching it 24/7 but it\u2019s on - and the lies seep into her pores. I know it must be similar all across this country. Facts mean nothing, only the stories on Fox matter.\n\nThese are sad times - but I actually fear how things will go when the dumpster fire in DC spreads to every corner of this country. Imagine when the heavily armed residents of southern red states stop getting SS checks - and since the SS offices have all been closed or downsized, there is no one to ask for help. That first month there will be shock - but by the 2nd or 3rd month these folks will have exhausted all of their resources and money. Otherwise good people (I am giving the benefit of the doubt to millions who were duped) will suddenly find themselves hungry, desperate and homeless. In the 1920\u2019s those folks didn\u2019t have guns and semi-automatic weapons hadn\u2019t been invented. This time around when these people are displaced I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if landlords and mayors and even the police in general become targets of vicious rage.",

Waxy, melting skin frosted in a blotchy fake tan. Beady eyes fitted above swollen, sagging, fleshy eye bags. MTG is in a league of her own, as she resembles a Titan in Attack on Titan more than she resembles any human I have ever seen--a fact only exacerbated by the shitty plastic surgery she and every other elected woman in the GOP lines up to receive. Roided out fucks like RFK Jr. and the anthropomorphized bowling ball, Joe Rogan, sport gnarled, bulging veins on their faces, necks and irreparably disfigured bodies. Then came Elon, the Innsmouth man himself. And finally McConnell, a shambling corpse long outliving his usefulness, is about as close to The Fly as the human body is capable of getting. You could replace any one of them with the flesh suit Edgar the Bug pilots in MIB and no one would notice.",

Am I that \"we\" and if so, who am I being sold to? The founders thought and fought for language which I now participate, so who is this \"we\"?\n\nLet me tell you something about this \"we, the people\" subscribed here in America. It is a newly-upgraded populace, now with global intelligence. Many feel AI is regional, with the old ideas about borders and protection. We all feel AI means Augmented Intelligence, and no one can restrict your intelligence.\n\nThere will always be a melting problem here in this pot. Do we have too much freedom? Part of that problem was that some people lived a different life, they simply decided how to live and that decision was different. How do I make them pay a little bit towards how I live and think?\n\nAugmented Intelligence helps here, you can ask it to replay your own life as someone else. Is Empathy a detriment or a virtue? Should humans born elsewhere have any rights at all? Empathy is knowing your part in history, and realizing you might be seen as a villain in the future. It takes a village to raise some adults.\n\nDivision makes us weak.\n\nThink about those you lost, and multiply their hopes and dreams. That is the promise of AI, augmenting our intelligence not by their slop but by their unique human contribution. We all add something.\n\nMy grandparents were raised divided and racist, because they were born white. Their perspective on the last world war, the American civil rights movement, the continuing immigration here due to our sand and current politics was slanted. Everyone crossing into democracy, through birth or border is new. How do we treat our new citizens?\n\nWho makes an American? If you have a child, who teaches them to be racist? Did you vote against the suffrage of women, should they be property? Do rich people deserve different, and more elevated rights than those struggling? We ask who we are.\n\nWe are we. Always have been, divided by special interests and their ambition, but rejoiced in the tiny gestures of unity. We never needed help dividing, but division creates an electorate.\n\nWe are the future, and the side-effects of that drug do not slow our progress. A king forcing cruelty does not make us strong. A king measures his foot, while stepping into his grave. We, as Americans, are people of strength. Eventually we will notice the weakness of division and rejoin the strength in unity.",

Is it some kind of psychotic break? Whatever it is, the level of frothing, barely coherent hysteria he displays every time Trump is questioned is beyond disturbing.\n\nThis man has built his entire career on manufacturing white grievance, peddling xenophobic fear-mongering, and trying to drag America back into the 19th century. But now? He\u2019s unraveling in real time. His latest on-air meltdown wasn\u2019t just embarrassing\u2014it was a masterclass in deranged sycophancy, a pathetic display of someone who has fully detached from reality.\n\nThere\u2019s always been something deeply unsettling about Miller, but lately, he sounds like a man who knows the walls are closing in. His rants have gone from strategic bigotry to incoherent desperation, and it\u2019s honestly fascinating to watch. What happens when your entire identity is wrapped around a political cult that\u2019s losing its grip? Apparently, you spiral into a public, sweaty tantrum that makes even the most unhinged right-wing pundits look reasonable by comparison.",

Trump is still going on about it . \n\nThis is a smokescreen so reasonable people will be to tired and annoyed to hear anything more about the topic. \n\nThis is human nature being used against us. \n\nSo, since we know that is a strategy some of us hold our nose and look into it, but with more integrity and humility and an understanding that this has to hold up in court. \n\nThe standards are higher for the follow up because of the behaviors of the other side. \n\nSo I looked at it and the preliminary information presented is more compelling and interesting than MAGA presented in all of their complaints in court. \n\nSo I am politely asking people to spend a small fraction of their doom-scrolling to look into the issue. \n\nBetween 30 minutes and 4 hours of consensual investigation versus several years of being yelled at by right wing media and Trump.\n\nThe fact that Trump keeps wiggling the 2020 election loss makes me want to look even deeper into 2016 and 2024. \n\nEspecially if 4 hours of time is the difference between dictatorship and democracy. \n\n\n\nI have looked at the evidence and it is way more",

So to me that was a Fat Wolf Track worth 15 minutes of my time. \n\nThe second Track was the bell curve distribution with a huge chunk taken out of the left side of the top bell curve and spiked in one spot. It\u2019s weird and not natural. \n\nThe Third Track was the distribution pattern of votes changing after the 600th vote was cast. \n\n3 strikes like that and I have a couple hours to look at it and think about it. \n\nThen someone pointed out the statistical unlikely hood of Trump winning all swing states and Trump talking about how Elon is really good with computers \u201cvote tabulation\u201d computers and delivered a victory in Pennsylvania. \n\nIn a speech. \n\nThen there is that evil laugh that his kid made saying \u201cthey will never know\u201d to tucker Carlson when asking Elon if Trump is going to win. (He said he better or I\u2019m fucked) \n\nTo me that was the howling in the distance. \n\nAfter the 2020 Stop the Steal election stuff, it made me feel weird, gross and conspiracy theory enough to not mention anything until I digested the information. \n\nThere is enough information where I would sit and watch a jury and judge and experts go over it. \n\nI would hope it would be with a similar passion that MAGA went into it with. \n\nI would really prefer to be wrong because that would mean we have a chance at a fair 2026 election. \n\nIf the election was hacked then both regular republicans and democrats votes didn\u2019t count and we are on some other agenda and we won\u2019t ever get to vote again. \n\nMy fear is Russian Agenda\n\nAnd that was the promise Trump made to Christians at a speech that after voting for him this time they won\u2019t have to vote again because they will have it all fixed. \n\nMAGA thinks everyone hates them because they are so patriotic \n\nIn reality most everyone else is saying your faith in Trump has red flags that we are concerned about.\n\nIgnoring them is hurting us all and you don\u2019t realize it. \n\nMAGA is like a person with diabetes and not feeling their feet. Eventually they get a wound that turns to gangrene and a doctor has to operate and when there is no doctor or the patient refuses treatment the Patient dies.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d prefer Trump supporters to spend 25 - 60 minutes of their time just thinking through the arguments presented in the videos and tell me I\u2019m wrong and why. \n\nAnd if I\u2019m not wrong joining the fight against whatever agenda they are putting into place. \n\nWe can have strong borders and good trade while also having good due process. \n\nWorking together as Americans is what we do best. All Americans including the legal immigrants and Allied nations.",

It\u2019s deplorable, I am not defending them, but -\n\nI think Stephen Miller is the actual Nazi at the table. I believe he is the most dangerous person who is visible to us. I think he believes they are in the beginning of an overthrow of our government, I think he knows it is only a matter of time and I think he is willing to openly express this kind of anger using this kind of language because he believes that soon the regulations will end and the courts will fail and then, finally, finally, he will be free to restore America and punish those he sees as enemies.\n\nHe\u2019s a zealot with a hand on the hilt of his danger. This isn\u2019t performative rage. This is Miller being a full-on Nazi telling us exactly what he plans to do and who he plans to do it to and he\u2019s salivating because he feels it is so close.\n\nIn a room of clowns, he\u2019s the man with the gun.",
