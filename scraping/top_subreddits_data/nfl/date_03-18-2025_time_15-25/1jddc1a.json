I actually prefer SW sometimes when flying to a place like Buffalo as there is a chance that the plane will be half empty and you will get an empty middle next to you, as opposed to Delta which I fly all the time and is 95% of the time a packed flight.",

Honestly there's some truth to that even though he's also saying a lot of BS\n\nHowever, instead of concluding like most reasonable people, that people shouldn't have to work 40 hours for so little and raising the wages of lower end jobs would majorly increase that gap, he decides to take the stance that we need to make **poor people even poorer** while keeping the lowest end of employed people the same.",

Schumer's capitulation managed to piss off centrists and leftists alike, and Newsom's podcast reeks of the same pointlessness of yielding to the right for no apparent benefit.

To paraphrase Pritzker's chief of staff, it's less about left vs center and more about fighting versus caving. AOC all the sudden is skyrocketing in popularity because of her ability to speak to the moment, moreso than her actual policy positions.\n\nThe next two cycles are going to be edifying. We might see a lot more Congressional incumbents get primaried, and the Presidential race is wide open. Walz I think shows a way to appeal to both sides between some universally appealing accomplishments like free school lunch on his record and a way of speaking that is relatable, but not bashful about asserting that government is good actually. Pritzker and Gretch might be able to pull off that kind of balance as well. It might not be a full tea party moment but I think a change could be coming.",

Learned this morning that she's a post-doctoral researcher in biology at a big name research institute working on cures for cancer and ways to slow down the aging process. She seems brilliant. Only two problems. One, she hates sports because sports fans are too obsessed with their games (though she matched with me despite my top pic being me in a Vikings jersey at a football game). Two, she lives like 3 hours away (longer in traffic) which is a long ass drive. Maybe on Saturday or sometime next week we can meet up and see if we connect in person like we have via text",

I asked her where we were going with this and if she wanted to be in a relationship and she told me she wasn't ready to date and we should stay friends \"for now\".

I loved the atmosphere and the music was great. I didn't mind the gameplay *most* the time.

Like if I\u2019m having meat with the meal I will keep separate if possible to make weighing it all out easier and more accurate.\u00a0\n\nI would encourage calorie counting though, just have to find the app that works best for you. I use the paid version of Cronometer because I like it but more importantly the foods in the database are all approved by the company so there is way more accuracy.\n\nAlso, super easy to create meals based on recipes and then use total weight for serving sizes so all you have to do is keep track of what you put in your recipe and then weigh how much is in your bowl for eating. And then I go back and modify the recipe each time I make it if I do mix it up, which I do frequently despite using the same basic recipe.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m like addicted to counting calories now. Once you get used to it and make a few simple changes that naturally comes out of experimentation and practice, it becomes simple and honestly just a way of life. I\u2019ll stop once I\u2019ve maintained my goal weight for about 3 months, so hopefully by the end of this year the way I\u2019m losing.\u00a0",

The one good thing is that among all the biggest TCGs, pokemon has been the best and doing reprints to keep card values reasonable. Even the most expensive cards in the current sets still mostly pale in comparison to other TCG's top cards. As long as your main goal is just collecting and trading/playing. Sealed product is definitely a bit harder to get right now, but personally I just buy singles or trade. And then buy older set packs which are easier to get.",

Grand Tour was *bad* when it tried to just be top gear, which is why they pivoted to just specials, and even the specials were extremely hit or miss. The last one was great (although nostalgia was doing a ton of heavy lifting there) but I can't for the life of me remember any of the others - the Mongolia one was good I guess?

It's actually a very calming beverage- though that may be because I drink Canarias Serena which has other herbs blended in like mint and lemon balm. I also enjoy that there's a technique to drinking it, so consuming it is also a bit of an activity. It really helps me as someone who has ADHD to have those chances to take a breather from what I'm doing and adjust my beverage before returning to work. \n\nThe only downside of coffee that yerba doesn't fix is the bathroom side of things...
