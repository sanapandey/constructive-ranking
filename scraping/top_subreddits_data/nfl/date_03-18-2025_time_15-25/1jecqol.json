Absolute best case scenario, we probably win 11 games and get bounced in the divisional round? \n\nThen we\u2019re back to a late 1st round pick with a soon-to-be third year QB that we have never seen take meaningful snaps. \n\nI have no idea if JJM is going to be good or not but I want to find out now and not kick this can down the road another year in favor of a 41 year old who hasn\u2019t looked good and/or stayed healthy the last three seasons.",
