Layden was a great run blocker but one of the worst pass protectors in the entire league. Cole Strange was injured (as he usually is) and played okay at Center when he came back. But it was the 1st time he played Center in his career so he snapped the ball early a couple times and was still learning the position.\n\nThey also have Sidy Sow who was pretty decent as a rookie and was expected to be the starter at LG. He was a little injured early in the season, and for whatever reason was relegated to backup. It was definitely weird because he looked like a future piece as a rookie and was a 3rd stringer with Mayo as a coach.\n\nSo they have a lot of question marks, and will probably either pay a starter in FA, or draft one early-ish. They might go with one of the players already on the team, but they don't inspire a lot of confidence after last year.",

Last season he worked with Andrews while they were both on IR to learn the position and he started at it for a few games end of the season.  He was actually an above average LG at times, but seemed injury prone so never really got to settle in properly at the position over a full season. He has the size to technically play LT (almost identical measurements to Charles Cross).  If hes healthy, hes probably better than any other LG we have kicking around on our roster.",

Strange really has flashed, and I think people thinks he worse than he is because of how high he was drafted. But the guy can't stay healthy, and that's a massive problem for a position group that needs continuity.\n\nI thought Sow was the long term solution heading into last year, but he never even got the chance last year. A struggling rookie in Robinson, and a guy who got cut midyear in Jordan both jumped him on the depth chart. If we were talking rookie year Sow I'd think he'd have a shot at starter but seeing him be 3rd string last year was so weird and definitely doesn't inspire confidence in how they view him. Obviously it's a new coaching staff so who knows.",
