Plus we got a \u201cgenerational QB prospect\u201d   \n\n2024-25; The QB looked pretty good but the team was (still) grossly outcoached and line was terrible so we sign 3 OL and 2 DL and hire one of the most sought after coaches \n\n\nI know nothing is certain but good rebuilds take a few seasons. The Bears get media clicks so they are offseason topic of discussions",

Jared Verse was fantastic last year, as well as many other dlineman all taken after 10.\n\nI'd argue that's more due to last draft being so intense offensively, though. There wasn't a single defensive player taken until pick 15, so the 3rd edge rusher was pick 19.\n\nOn top of that the top 3 edge rushers were considered pretty even: For example nfldraftbuzz had Latu at 89.6, Verse at 89.5 and Turner at 89.3. The Consensus Mock Draft Big Board also had Latu 17th and Verse 19th. \n\nBy comparison nfldraftbuzz only has Carter/Pierce in that zone (Carter 91.1, Pierce 89.5) at which point it drops to 88.0 for Shemar (which would be barely above Chop Robinson for 4th last year who had 87.9), so it feels like there's more of a dropoff. But it still might be worth it to go in anyway.\n\nPersonally, I'd love to see the Bears draft Jeanty to see if he can Gibbs it up in that system. McMillan will be gone but would be fun with Rome Odunze to really size it up but probably not the best usage.",

Carter got a 91.4 in 2024, Pearce an 87.1, Shemar Stewart a 79.5, Mike Green a 92.4 (but his fall is mostly character concerns) and Mykel Williams a 78.4. Only got one year of PFF grades with subs but they're comparatively higher on it with Green (but also mostly see it as Carter/Pearce...and Donovan Ezeiruaku actually). Walter Football seems to feel the class is similar with Carter/Mykel/Pearce this year vs. Turner/Verse/Latu last year (in that order).\n\nI'd say the impression I get overall is this draft's high end is a bit lower and there's not a consensus past Carter/Pearce the way there was last year but it doesn't mean nobody's good. Plus the Bears could potentially trade back and then pick someone still.",

While they were 5-12 I think they could\u2019ve gone anywhere between 8-9 to 10-7, as they had a number of super close losses that could\u2019ve gone their way. They\u2019re not devoid of talent and potential, and with FA mainly helping the ever crucial o line, a good draft class help further. Imo they will be a team to look out for this year. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re SB contenders but maybe a playoff appearance is possible and overall just more solid performance.
