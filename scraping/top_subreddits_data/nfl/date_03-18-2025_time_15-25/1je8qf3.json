The Eagles D line was actually collapsing the pocket well that game but didn\u2019t have sacks to show for it. They finally broke through. That\u2019s why the 2022 Super Bowl loss to KC was annoying - the field disrupted the Eagles pass rush more so than other units. The dropped pass by Brady wasn\u2019t egregious tho IMO. The throw was a bit high/far and not how it was practiced.\u00a0\n\nI know Cox couldn\u2019t get a ring this year being retired but I\u2019m glad BG avenged him.",
