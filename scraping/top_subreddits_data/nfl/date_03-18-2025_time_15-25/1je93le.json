But Graham was a very, very good player as early as 2012 (his 3rd season).\n\nThe general NFL fan just didn't appreciate pressure as much back then, and perception was largely based off how many sacks a guy got. With things like PFF, Next gen stats and just better sports media being available (from an Xs and Os stand point) the average fan has a much better understanding of the impact that brings.",
