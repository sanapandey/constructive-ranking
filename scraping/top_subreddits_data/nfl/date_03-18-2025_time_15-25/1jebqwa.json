    "selftext": "These two terms make no sense as they are. They would make more sense if the terms for each play were swapped.\n\nTOUCHBACK: The offense scores a touchdown when they move the ball to the defense's endzone, the defense scores a touchback when they force the offense **back** and then down in the offense's endzone.\n\nSAFETY: A player fields the ball in their own endzone and chooses to down the ball to not risk being tackled close to their endzone. They're playing it **safe**.\n\nIt's the offseason so why not.",
