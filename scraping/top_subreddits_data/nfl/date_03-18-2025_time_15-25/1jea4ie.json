It's that it's completely possible.\n\nHas Kyler Murray done anything yet? What about Tua? How's Richardson looking? What's Zach Wilson up to? Hey, Trevor Lawrence has one playoff win!!! Sam Darnold is on his 5th team in 5 years. Is Trey Lance still alive? Hey, Baker is finally living up to his hype. He only took his 4th team and two stud WRs for it to finally come to fruition. Trubisky still the backup for the Bills? How's Wentz doin? Oh oh Daniel Jones?\n\nGoff, Burrow, Allen, Herbert, are the only ones that have recently panned out while being a premium top pick in the league right now. And Goff is only there because they made the super bowl on the Rams. So many people wrote him off. \n\nStroud, Daniels, and Maye have shown promise and would put them on there but two are rookies and the other one took a huge step back in his 2nd year. And the further back I keep going, the more the gap widens.",
