The offense was heavily catered toward fitting his limitations and he had very little control over actually running the offense ie play calling, audibles, etc. He did very little pre snap and the offense was primarily designed with short check downs, crossers, and play action. His arm was never really tested. He had a great completion percentage but that was more evidence of the offense never truly opening up for him in my opinion. Like I said he was very accurate short to intermediate but he had a bad arm. Had McDaniels stayed OC is it possible he could have been a serviceable game manager? Yes. But what happened with Patricia is as much evidence to the fact that Patricia is a bad coach as it is that Mac Jones could never be a true play maker in an nfl offense. Not to say Patricia ever should have been an nfl offensive coordinator but my point is more toward the trajectory of Mac jones career.",
