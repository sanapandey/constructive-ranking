Just a lot of pure Boomerism. \n\nChase Young was the consensus 1st overall player in the draft, but there was a serious case (and not just a hindsight one) that Haskins was bad on the field, and the off the field stuff was in fact proving to be a problem, and that QB was the move. Barring that, he could have tricked a team into trading up. He did not, just declared months before the draft that he loved Chase Young. Which meant both LAC and MIA could stand pat at 5 and 6, because it was known DET was not going QB at 3 and NYG was going to take an OT to protect Daniel Jones. Boomer Football Takes: \"Defense wins championships, build in the trenches, take the safe pick.\" \n\nJamin Davis is a freak athlete but small for a linebacker, and Ron was convinced he should take him in the top 20 and coach him up, when our team had massive holes at all the other high dollar positions outside of EDGE. We needed CBs, WRs, and a QB and he took a project linebacker. Boomer Football Take \"When I was in Carolina we had this guy Luke Kuechly. Heard of him? I see a lot of him in Jamin.\" \n\nJahan Dotson he traded down out of Chris Olave, then took WR5 in Jahan Dotson, a guy who was way too much of a size and athleticism outlier to draft in the 1st round. If he had ended up good, he would have been the biggest statistical outlier at the WR position I can remember. Guys as small as him have to be freaky agile and explosive, and he isn't. Boomer Football Take \"I don't care how fast he runs in underwear, that's not game speed.\" \n\nEmanuel Forbes was another massive outlier from a size perspective. He's just too damn small to play NFL CB, and lots of people said so on draft day. But he got a lot of INTs in his final college season. Boomer Football Take \"Look, he's a bit small, but he just as a nose for the ball. Guy just makes plays.\"",

The only time they did it was when the NBA was literally running an owner-less team, and so they were the \u201cowners\u201d and could do literally anything an owner would be able to do.

The team actually moving to Vegas doesn't make that much sense to me personally because they're not really going to build a second casino in Vegas at this point, they've had like 25 years since the Venetian Opened to do that and they still haven't. \n\nI think what's way more likely is the mavericks ownership probably cares less about winning than most owners, their GM has this weire vendetta against Luka, and they had internal analytics saying Luka is a little overrated and won't age well, all of these things combined into trading a player most saw as untouchable.\n\nHowever, all of that still doesn't really explain why they got such a small haul for him in the trade.",

Tunsil blaming his false starts on the center not doing their job when, in reality, he's trying to jump the snap to improve his numbers really seemed to rub a lot of Houston media members the wrong way.\u00a0\n\n\nGuy is a great player, but he's nowhere close to being a Trent Williams who, from what I've heard, gets genuinely pissed when the other OL aren't doing their jobs.

And the problem is that Tunsil has the talent to make that approach work, but none of our other guys did while they looked to Tunsil for guidance. \n\nOur line couldn't handle basic stunts, their footwork was a mess, some guy's were clearly out of shape, and yet apparently they were bragging about who they didn't personally give up sacks to following losses in which Stroud got hammered? While Tunsil is blaming his chronic false starts on officiating and the center when he CLEARLY tries to jump the snap early to beat his guy? The culture was awful in that group and Tunsil was part of that.\n\nAlso, we weren't keeping him after this current contract for exactly the reason Tunsil himself stated. They just paid Stingley and have Stroud and Anderson right around the corner and we keep drafting great young talent who could also warrant extensions. It's just a better situation fir everyone involved. Tunsil goes to a place where he doesn't have to be the leader and can get paid, Washington protects Daniel's, and Houston replenished their draft capital, freed up cap space, and actually commits to an already apparent culture reset in that offensive line room.",

And the tricky thing is that he's actually pretty likable and charismatic so guys WANT to follow him and elect him as a team captain.

CJ Stroud said on a Podcast \u201che not doing nothing extra at practice\u201d CJ said it in a joking way maybe he was joking, no one really knows. Or maybe Tunsil gave the impression to CJ that\u2019s how a veteran should be\n\n2. This one is a bit more fuzzy so someone else can maybe clarify the exact details. While Tunsil was under contract as the highest paid LT someone jumped over him and he shared their contract on Instagram with \u201c\ud83d\udc40\u201d shortly after he got an extension that put him back at #1\n\n3. I cannot recall a *single* time that Tunsil helped CJ up after getting hit. Even after other fights would break out, Tunsil was never around. \n\n4. Even his first (I believe) interview with the Commanders was done at his house, not at the facility. He doesn\u2019t come in unless he *has* too.\n\n5. This is pure speculation too but there is evidence to believe he was a media leak in Houston. Idk about this one myself because I don\u2019t remember all the details so I don\u2019t put too much stock in it, but it\u2019s something I suppose. \n\nAny one of these alone can be explained away but as a whole they look bizarre. Tunsil is a great player and his teammates love him because he\u2019s a cool dude. If Washington\u2019s o-line has an established culture already it\u2019ll be a great trade for the Commanders, but if people expect Tunsil to lead\u2026 uh oh.",

Even in a down year and factoring in his penalties, he played pretty well last year.\n\nIt's hard to see the vision of how the OL will be rebuilt during Stroud's rookie contract window. This isn't a great draft class for tackles, and the only viable free agent options are Cam Robinson and Jedrick Wills. Trotting out Blake Fisher as the day 1 starter at LT seems risky. The other positions are workable on paper, but there's not a single starter I see that couldn't potentially be improved on.\n\nI think it's fair to question the Texans' decision making process from the outside perspective. Taking on $14 million in salary for Christian Kirk is fine in a vacuum, but in hindsight it sure seems like that money could have been better spent shoring up the OL like the Bears and the Vikings did. If we were ranking NFL offensive lines pre-draft, Houston would have to be bottom 5, if not dead last.",

Howard actually did pretty well filling in at LT a couple of seasons ago and Fisher was clearly drafted as being a future starter at tackle in mind.\n\nI think it's important to add to this all that Caserio and Demeco Ryans really seem to think that a lot of what went wrong last year was down to scheme and coaching. Our guys were awful in their basic fundamentals and there's been a lot of reporting to suggest that Strausser, who they fired this offseason, was checked out and basically wanted to retire after the '23 season. So you had an OL coach who was halfway retired, Tunsil wasn't going to pick up that slack, and Slowik was forcing a scheme that didn't fit.\n\nOn the flipside, our new OC has really hammered fundamentals and scheming to fit your players and their strengths. Caserio and Ryans never criticize guys publicly, but the repeated message around Caley's hiring was how he wasn't beholden to one scheme and that fundamentals matter. Pretty much every beat writers took that as \"We're not saying Strausser and Slowik neglected those things, but they neglected those things.\"\n\nWe'll see how that all turns out, but I think they're hoping they can have an OL where the sum is greater than the individual parts instead of one guy being an All Pro while the rest are dog shit.",
