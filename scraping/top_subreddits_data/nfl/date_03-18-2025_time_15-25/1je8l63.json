Well another 10 years pass and he becomes an absolute cornerstone of our franchise over that span. Helped bring us not only our first SB victory but a second one within that time frame too. He is one of the players that I can say is the true embodiment of what a Philadelphia Eagle is and I will miss seeing him on the field. Thanks for everything BG!",
