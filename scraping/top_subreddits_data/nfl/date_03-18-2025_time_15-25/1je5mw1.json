            "body": "The attorney at our law firm that organizes the bracket pool takes it way too seriously. He even puts together a comprehensive guide with break downs of every teams, analytics, an overview of Dean Oliver's Four Factors, and highlights specific upset candidates and Pros and Cons of those picks. He does a PowerPoint on Wednesday during lunch too, it's well attended he buys a deli spread, which puts butts in seats. His analysis is actually really good stuff. Probably on par with anything you'd see on the Athletic or ESPN+.\n\nBeing a lover of low stakes office drama that I am, I always completely disregard his guide. Turn in my bracket as soon as the play in games are over, and almost always go complete chalk and/or blue blood all the way through. This always pisses him off because \"that's not the fun part about the tournament\" and \"you don't put any thought or effort in it.\" \n\nAnyway, my all Chalk bracket won in 22 (i think) when Kansas won and 3 1 seeds made the final four. His passive aggressive congratulatory email as well as \"prize\" presentation was great. I used my winnings to hold an office pizza party, and in honor of my all chalk bracket it was only plain cheese and pepperoni from Domino's. \n\nIt ain't much, but I do what I can. Anyway, AITA?",

It adds up over time especially with compounding interest. \n\nAnd if you're early on in your career (as it seems you are), contribute to a Roth 401(k) which means it comes out post-tax in the present, meaning, you will not have to pay taxes on it when you retire.

                    "body": "Ok, some simple stuff for a single, unmarried individual:\n\nFirst, make sure you have a combination of health, dental and vision. If you're fairly young, healthy individual with no chronic illnesses and want to roll the God dice, get the less expensive option for health as straight insurance.\n\nSecond, if your employer offers you a 401K, they usually match a few percentage points. This is the benefit you should take the most time to calculate. 401K's a pre-tax benefit, meaning the percentage is against what your gross salary is, not your take home. **Contributing to your 401K may lower your tax burden.*\n\nObviously, you lose a lot in taxes, especially as a single and single-income individual. You need to do the math, but let's just say you make 100K for a nice round number, and your employee offers a 10% match. First, you need to know the max individual contribution for a 401K is $23500 for the entire year. **This does not include the company match.**\n\nSo, if you contributed up to the max, your effective tax burden for the year is $76,500, and your total contributions would be $33500 because your employer matches up to 10%, which for a 100K salary is a neat 10K.\n\nBut these numbers bring up a point, and this is the reason you need to calculate:\n\nIf you can hit the max, do so always. However, most people cannot, but not contributing literally raises your tax burden, and leaves free money on the table. To put in perspective, if you put in 10K for the year into your 401K, your effective tax burden becomes 90K, and your 401K total contributions become 20K, because your employer matches you up to 10K. Quite literally doubling your contributions.\n\nAs long as your expenses allow it, always, at the very least, meet your employer's contribution match, because you will double your money every year for free. You honestly should be changing your lifestyle to allow at least that match (ideally the full max). Compound interest starting early and often will make you well off within 30 years.\n\nNow for the final thing that will be relevant to you, but not entirely necessary, a Health Savings Account.\n\nThis is essentially a slush fund that also takes money out pre-tax that is used to pay for medical services. The maximum for the year for a single individual is $4300.\n\nThere are a few caveats. It can only be used for specified health care costs. And if you do not use all of it, you lose whatever is in your fund at the start of the next calendar year.\n\nThis may be relevant to you if you have reoccurring costs for like prescriptions, doctors' visits etc.\n\nFinally, let me explain why your contributions to these funds may not even have much of a hit to your take home. Since these are pre-tax, you start eating towards the taxable amount per paycheck. You may contribute $200 a paycheck but only see a $50 reduction to your take home since it changes your taxation calculus. This is why you need to calculate it.",

This US administration along with many in the West clearly gives no shits at all about the human dignity and basic rights of the Palestinians and wants to cleanse them from their land, and calling that out makes you a terrorist sympathizer. But they have an easy time doing that because a colossal segment of the pro-Palestine public views Israel as the essence of all evil and wrong that exists rather than a country of human beings with terrible government in the midst of a millennia-long social/cultural/ethnic/religious/political conflict, and acts with zero responsibility as such. \n\nSo, it\u2019s much easier to just not play the game, keep my views to myself (outside of these OCD rants of course), donate to the right causes, and hope that my conscience is clean when I put my head to my pillow at night.",

The U235 didn't have time to fission very thoroughly with this design. Which is why it's so inefficient.\n\nFat Man used a spherical plutonium pit that was explosively compressed via a shell of explosives. This design is more efficient, and is the basic design of modern nuclear weapons. The uniform shockwave from the conventional explosives compresses the subcritical mass of plutonium. There was a component in the center made of beryllium and other materials (IIRC) that released a flood of neutrons during the compression of the pit. This more thoroughly fissioned the plutonium, resulting in greater efficiency.",

Here's a few of the big ones in no particular order. \n\n1. Stay silent/don't move when someone else is hitting. Stand behind their back or to their front as they address a ball, obviously comfortably away from their swing path. Don't stand behind them relative to where they are aiming, as you would at a range. \n\n2. Be ready when it's your turn. One, maybe two practice swing and let it rip. \n\n\n3. If you're taking multiple shots before getting to their balls, pick up your ball to keep the pace moving. The absolute worst isn't sucking at golf, it's sucking at golf and making everyone (including the groups behind you) wait for you. \n\n4. Don't walk in anyone's line on the green. Walk around the outside of their ball's path to the pin as much as reasonably possible. \n\n5. Repair divots and ball marks.\n\n\n6. If you're riding a cart let someone else drive. They'll keep you from taking it somewhere it shouldn't go. If walking just remember your bag never goes on the green. \n\n\nI'll reiterate the most important thing though, just tell the group you're completely new to actual golf and they should be more than willing to help you out.

They are constantly understaffed, and there's a hiring freeze so it's unlikely to get better soon. Her boss has essentially said that anyone who can't keep up with the pace of work, they can find a replacement for.\n\nOn the other hand, my wife is a people-pleasing perfectionist. Her boss promoted her and fought for her to get more pay. She worries about leaving her team when they're in a rough spot from a staffing perspective. Her job is fully remote, and it's increasingly difficult to find that elsewhere. She manages people and, while she doesn't like it, she is scared of taking a step back career wise, and worried about explaining it on her resume. \n\nHer friend and previous coworker works for a large, well known company (probably not to most here, but it's a giant infrastructure company that's well-known if you work in a certain industry). They are looking for someone to join their team. He knows and likes my wife, and his boss also knows my wife's work product since she used to do work for them when she was at a BigLaw (TM) firm. Her friend told her that he has taken a call on a weekend a single time, that everyone goes home at 5 PM, and that every Friday is a half day. On the negative side, it's in office every day and not super flexible, and it would likely mean taking a step back in terms of title. \n\nMy wife is conflicted and hesitant to move forward. She is scared of change. She is scared of burning bridges with her boss and her team. She is scared of damaging or setting back her career. \n\nI am scared of the opposite issue. I'm scared she's burning herself out. I'm scared she is letting perfect be the enemy of good. I'm scared she's going to keep making herself miserable in the pursuit of maintaining an image or her ego. I'm worried she's going to pass on an opportunity to have a better, more relaxing life only to burn herself out in the next 12 months and then no longer have this opportunity. I've explained all of this to her. She's still waffling. I do not know what else to do at this point.",

It's all the above reasons: worrying about career damage, worrying about leaving her team and boss in the lurch, worry about title, etc.\n\n>Is being able to work from home really beneficial if she's putting in all these extra hours?\n\nTBF to her point, we have dogs and we'd have to take them to daycare 3 days a week if she didn't work from home. Her working remote also allows us flexibility in working from other places and taking trips now that she'd otherwise have to take time off for in the future. \n\nI don't think that's worth the trade off for her mental health, but she does have very real concerns. \n\n>I'd just reiterate to her that while it may be a \"step down\" in title it's a huge step up in peace of mind and respect for her time outside of work.\u00a0\n\nBoy, have I done this.

                    "body": "You mentioned that you've talked with her about your fears that you describe in the last paragraph, but how personal was that conversation?  Everything you listed was a worry about how her current job is affecting *her,* but how is it affecting *you?*\n\nLast year, my wife made a massive career change for very similar reasons to your wife.  She was overworked and constantly stressed, but worried about giving up the stability of her career, along with the money.  However, our personal lives were in a major rut.  She would be in her office until 6 or 7 most weeknights and then we'd just eat dinner in front of the TV as we quietly binge-watched a few episodes of whatever show we were working on at the time and then went to bed.  We didn't really even talk, outside of commenting on what we were watching, because she was mentally exhausted and I didn't want to burden her with anything else, so I was internalizing a lot of shit as well.  Maybe on the weekends, we'd find time to go out with friends or do something together, but outside of that, it was starting to feel like we had just started dating and were only really seeing each other like once a week, despite living together and sleeping in the same bed.\n\nIt didn't just impact me, though.  I think one of the things that surprised her most after she went through with it was that almost all of her friends responded to the news that she quit her job with some variation of \"It's about time!\"  She was surprised because she hadn't realized how much the job was affecting all the other aspects of her life.  Even her book club friends whom she sees once per month were noticing how miserable she was at her old job.\n\nShe's a few months into her new career now and the difference is incredible.  She's *much* more \"present\" when we're hanging out together.  Sometimes when she gets home from work, we'll just end up chatting for like an hour about whatever.  Other times, she'll take a few hours to work on a personal project or hobby before we settle down for the evening.  We've gotten the ball rolling on some home improvement projects we had been putting off.  She's been more social.  The list goes on.  I feel like I have my partner back and I'm realizing that before she quit her old job, I was feeling more like a caregiver than a husband, just trying to make her life as easy as possible in the aspects I could control and ignoring my own needs in favor of supporting her.  \n\nSure, money is a little tighter now (OK...a lot tighter in our case,) but it's absolutely worth the trade to have a happier life outside of work.  That's the time that actually matters.  \"Work to live, don't live to work\" and all that.\n\nSo yeah, if you haven't already, I'd really try to emphasize how all of this is affecting *you* (and maybe also encourage her to talk to her friends about it as well, if she hasn't already) because if you only frame it as worry about *her,* she's more likely to have the response of \"I can handle it\" or worse, \"I *need to* handle it because no one else will/we need the money/my boss expects it/etc.\" rather than understanding that it's impacting other people in her life as well.\n\nWow...that turned into a bit of a ramble, but I hope it was helpful.",

But yesterday morning one of my best friends came by to drop off a coffee and chat 'cuz she knew I've been in a funk. She told me she might take the 6pm Reggaeton class. I agreed to join her if she did 'cuz she ALWAYS says she'll take X class but bails last second. Not for any bad reasons - she's a single mom and works as a therapist sometimes independently taking on clients. Her schedule is packed to the brim and finding time to take dance classes since her divorce has been hell for her. I was sorta brushing it off as a \"yeah *sure* you'll be there\" agreement. So imagine my shock when I got a text at 5 that she was changing and getting in the car to head to class. Fuck, I gotta take the 6pm class tonight and put on my mask to hide my funk for 4 whole hours. WHEW.\n\nThe worst part of that is that the hardest 2 hours, the 2 hours of genuine \"need your best, give your all\" hip hop practice is the last 2 hours. Most of my teammates are gassed by 9pm solely from the first hour of practice and I'm doing it after 2 hours of dancing already. Plus I'm the captain so my ass is exhausted, feeling like I'm going to puke, putting on the \"this ain't shit\" mask over the mask I'm already wearing to hide the funk I'm in and hyping my teammates up during water breaks and checking in on everyone to keep spirits high. Our choreographer had a brilliant idea though to ask the front office staff to come see our progress towards the end of practice and have us perform for them. There's something about having an audience, even if it's only 2 people, that makes everything feel easier.\n\nAfter practice as everyone is leaving to head home I'm just relaxing in the lobby for a few minutes. Both to catch my breath for my drive home, and to make sure everyone else is getting out of the studio okay and nobody is having a mental breakdown (we had one on Saturday, dance practice can be vicious). Two of my teammates are hanging in the lobby with me talking to the front desk staffer who is closing up for the night, both teammates I've known since 2022 now and who were on last years team with me. So of course they've known me long enough to pick up that I'm not in my usual mood and are trying to figure out what I'm hiding. I had to directly tell them it wasn't something they needed to be involved in for them to finally stop poking at it and make their way to their cars.",

When someone finds me attractive or likes me, I like to think I know it (not that I was confident enough to act on it when I was single or would now).

I didn't remember her at all before I saw the screenshot, but \"she\" randomly texted me once, in the middle of the night, \"i like u\". She'd never done anything like that before, so naturally my first instinct was to screenshot it and send it to my friend, saying that she must just be drunk and didn't mean it. I sent her a very neutral and non-committal text back and the next morning she responded \"so sorry that was my little sister \ud83d\udc80\". *Maybe* it was, but however little game I have at 21, I had even less at 19",

I had a girl directly tell me she had been dreaming about me and thought we'd make great parents together while cuddled into my arm with her hand on my chest and her head resting on my shoulder. When I asked her if she was interested in dating she said she was only looking to be friends and didn't intend to lead me on. Sometimes people just haven't figured themselves out so they're confusing you with how confused they are.\n\nIf you want a good dumbass college kid can't catch a hint story I have a great one for you. There was a girl in our college dorms named Mackenzie. She was *always* fucking with the guys in our dorms. Dropping a pen and picking it up real slow right in front of you, cuddling into your chest in just the right way, etc. She did it to all of us just to prove she could string us along and we all fell for it every time. But we all knew she was into Austin, the super devout Christian who wouldn't even entertain her flirting. She told everyone she was into Austin, we were always helping her with her schemes to seduce Austin, she even offered to pay for his virginity once in the dorms. One night most of the dorm crew is out at a party and just Mackenzie and I are chilling in the dorms. We're in the hallway of her floor, having a few drinks (RA's were out) and talking about her schemes to seduce Austin. She suddenly stops mid-convo and tells me (it's been a decade and a half, I might be paraphrasing) \"Ya know this Austin thing is just a joke. You're really the most amazing guy I've met and I have such a huge crush on you.\" It came out of nowhere but my brilliant 19 year old college mind figured she was getting sloppy with her joke seductions and I was finally going to outplay this girl who had been seducing me to make me pop boners in front of my friends so she could laugh at me for like 6 months. So I just laughed in her face. Didn't say a word, just felt supremely confident I had caught her in her game and was going to be the winner for once. I felt so fucking smart for 2 seconds until she started crying and sprinted into her room, slamming the door behind her. She never forgave me for being an asshole the one time she took off her mask and tried being genuine instead of her normal over-confident seductress act.",

But what she meant was that he mentally/physically stepped out of the relationship as in not being present for my sister or their daughter. Now he's trying to blame it all on my sister like she's the only one that did anything wrong and he can't possibly be to blame for anything.\u00a0\n\n\nThe fucked up thing is that I think he blames their daughter because my sister is the one who spends most of the time parenting her or paying attention to her so he's feeling like my sister isn't paying enough attention to him.\u00a0\n\n\nMy sister talked with him last night and gave him some options of which I think he picked divorce. It's so fucked up because ***he*** pursued my sister in the first place. My cousin was marrying his half-brother. He was the best man and my sister was the maid of honor so they spent a lot of time together getting stuff ready for the wedding. After everything was done and he was heading back home he asked his half-brother for my sister's number because he wanted to keep talking with her. He lived multiple states away too so they both spent time flying to spend time with each other. He moved to our state when their relationship got a little more serious.\u00a0\n\n\nI just can't square all the effort he put into the relationship at the beginning with how he is acting now. It's just fucking mystifying to me because I know if I went through all that effort and uprooted my life in another state to move to a new state for a relationship that I'd put in a little more effort when things got rocky.\u00a0",

Then they introduced \"active time battle,\" which added a time element to turn-based play.  When XII rolled around, combat was auto-initiated and a \"gambit\" system was introduced that was basically a finite state machine to help the characters react to real-time conditions, but this was the start of taking all strategy away from the player and forcing them into action.  XIII didn't even allow you to develop characters with any freedom, there were six roles and you could really only swap back and forth between them.  Combat in XV was almost entirely devoid of strategy and just wanted you to mash buttons.\n\nXVI is nothing but button-mashing.  Instead of unlocking innate abilities that help you in battle, you unlock new combos or upgrade existing ones.  Oh, I can press X+A together to do another attack that's so fast I can't even tell what's happening on screen, great.\n\nObviously I'm more of a traditional JRPG fan, so when XVI presented an option to play \"Story Mode\" where combat was de-emphasized, I thought that would be a good alternative.  It's not.  In story mode, the game auto-dodges, auto-heals, and the system does all of the combos for you and only expects you to hit X.  I am five hours into it and I haven't been hit yet in combat.  This makes every single battle tedious as fuck, because it still takes the same amount of time to finish the fights in order to progress the story.\n\nAnd since I'm ranting impotently here, I'll add that I expected XVI to have better graphics than XV, but it doesn't.  It already looks like a five year old game.",

You've got the game on your account all ready for installation. I bought Resident Evil 4 Remake for 19 bucks not long after it came out, Alan Wake 2 for the same, Cuphead and it's DLC for about $5, Biomutant for like $3, etc...

I see Reese's name pop up a lot, but never seems to be discussed positively.  Most recently I guess she was celebrating winning a tournament she didn't play in.  From what I gather, most people seem to think she's not very good despite her demanding to be treated like she is.  Anyways, that's not really the point.  I was at the grocery store somewhat recently and saw her on a box of Reese's Puffs cereal.  Thought it was a bit odd, but then again I guess the name made for an easy marketing gimmick.  Then I saw she had her own \"meal\" at McDonalds, and it got me wondering is she that marketable?  All I see, at least on the internet which of course isn't the best place to look, is that she's largely disliked.  Are there people going out of their way to order the Angel Reese burger at McDonalds?  Is there a more positive association that exists outside of the internet that would get people to come buy it?",

Caitlyn Clark not only did the same gesture at the end of an Elite 8 game that year, John Cena Tweeted back at her about it, and the Final Four audience on ESPN chose it as their favorite celebration of the tournament.\n\nI think there's a certain degree of Tebowing that's gone on around Caitlyn Clark, and just like when Tebow was getting all kinds of attention, players around him were tired of hearing about it, the same way that a lot of WNBA players including Reese are tired of hearing about how Clark is single-handedly saving the league or taking it to new heights.",
