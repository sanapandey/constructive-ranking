I've spent the entire regular season watching the Chiefs play ~~great~~ bad football it's just not fair.\n\nIf the Chiefs lose again I will face that the Eagles deserved the win, but I am just 100% sure it was a fluke and does a big disservice to the Chiefs and the NFL.",

The defensive core is still together and the offense is absolutely just fine with Hunt/Pacheco in the backfield and Rice/Worthy/Hollywood/Juju/Kelce/Gray are good receiving options.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing that says the Chiefs will not be back full force this season other than salty ass fans (who says this literally every off-season since Mahomes was on the team).",

Don't get cocky though and act like you're dominating the league for years, your team is 1-1 against us in the SB the last 3 years and we're 2-1 in the SB the last 3 years. Get over yourself.",
