            "body": "I'm pretty pro-Martha.\n\nFor anyone who doesn't know, Martha Stewart grew up working class.  Her family was very DIY because they had to be.  \n\nMartha was gorgeous, so she became a model to pay for college.  She graduated and immediately and got married and had a baby, because that is what you did at the time.  She hated being a SAHM, so she became a stockbroker... in the 60s, when female stockbrokers were rare.\n\nMartha and her husband bought an 18th century house and completely restored it.  Then Martha opened a catering company.  That lead to cookbooks, a TV show, a magazine, a home goods line, another TV show, etc.  She is a self-made billionaire.  She also did a stint in jail for insider trading (or more accurately, lying while they were investigating insider trading).\n\nWould I want to hang out with Martha?  Not really.  There are no ethical billionaires and she doesn't seem super fun.  But I think she is an incredibly skilled person.  She can cook, she can bake, she can garden, she can raise livestock, she can refinish furniture, she can explain the history of French cooking and Early American architecture.  Over the years a lot of actresses have tried to be Martha Stewart, but none of them have had her breadth of skills.  \n\nOf course there is a massive team behind her at this point, but she is also one of those people who doesn't believe in relaxing.  So of course she has another book coming out.  She will have books and TV shows in the works until she dies.",

                    "body": "My biggest pro Martha comment was she created (even if it was just lending her name only) one of the best brands for affordable housewares. It was still more expensive than say black and decker and other entry level brands, but Martha Stewart Living products sold in a Kmart were some true high quality stuff. My family home has stuff almost 20 years old that outlasted more expensive items that came from 'posh' stores. Including sheet sets that have gotten washed hundreds of times over the years. And it came from Kmart! \n\nIf she was the final sign off on product quality then kudos to her. Feels like no one makes stuff of that quality for a working class or lower middle class budget anymore.",

You can actually talk to the ghost writers, you know.",
