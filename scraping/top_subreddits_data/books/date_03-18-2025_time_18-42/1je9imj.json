    "selftext": "I was wondering if there has ever been any really ridiculous reasons people have been annoyed at a book? I'm asking, because I just finished a book and got mad at a really stupid detail.\n\nSo I just finished Crooked Kingdom by Leigh Bardugo. Loved the story, the characters, the writing, the setting, etc. Gave it 5/5 stars.\n\nHowever, I had already read the entire Shadow & Bone trilogy and Six of Crows prior to this and one detail at the end of CK really pissed me off. So Leigh Bardugo added a 'cast of characters' list at the end of that book which included how to pronounce the characters names. This also included the name of a character who appeared in all three S&B books, was mentioned in SoC and appeared in CK. For those wondering, it was >! Genya !<.\n\nAnd through that guide I figured out I was mispronouncing their name in my head the entire time. I got so annoyed, because my way of pronouncing it makes so much more sense to me. I'm still annoyed, so I wondered if anyone else has a funny/dumb/petty reason for being annoyed at a book/author.",

There are a lot of indie romance series out there that insist every single book out of the twenty-four that they've written has to be read in the exact same order they were written. Okay, I say a lot, it's not as common as just straight up being like \"yeah, these are stand-alone but in the same universe\", but still, it's something I've noticed. Anyways, it's a gimmick to make your purchase the whole series. I read the first one and then I read like book number seven and there was zero need for me to have read the six books in-between. There were a few vague details, but it's a romance book, the gaps are very easily filled in. \n\nOther things I cannot stand are when authors put their really bad music playlist at the front of the book. It makes irrationally peeved, especially if it's just music I don't like or vibe with at all, it really sours my opinion on the book itself, even though it probably shouldn't. Oh. Okay. I have a specific book for you all. \n\nZodiac Academy is very badly written, but I don't know what those authors did, but it was laced with like word-crack. I sped through that series, only to come up to the book before the last. They promised it was going to be the last book. Swore up and down. Came out, it's their worst reviewed book yet, because it was like 900 pages of just nonsense used to stretch out the book instead of finishing it like they promised. It was their series that had a mild bump in popularity on TikTok, so I understanding wanting to cling to it, but it just made me lose total interest in the series and a loss of respect for the authors.",

A small black marble popped into the slot. Malenfant inspected it; it was blank. Emma could see there was easily room for a thousand such balls in the box, if need be.\n\n> Malenfant scowled and pressed the lever again.\n\n> His name was on the third ball he produced.\n\n> \u2018There are ten balls in the box,\u2019 said Malenfant immediately.\n\n> \u2018Why do you say that ?\u2019\n\n> \u2018Because if there were a thousand in there it's not likely that I'd reach myself so quickly.\u2019\n\n> Cornelius nodded. \u2018Your intuition is sound. This is an example of Baye's rule, wich is a technique for assigning probabilities to competing hypotheses with only limited information. In fact--\u2019 He hesitated, calculating. \u2018--The probability that you're right is now two thirds, on the basis of your ball being third out.\u2019 \n\nIt's all good except... The actual probability of there being 10 balls instead of 1000 is 100/101, not 2/3. \n\nIt just... completely ruined the book for me. How can it be hard sci-fi if the math is provably wrong!? There is no suspension of disbelief if I know for sure that it's not true!",

And the folks on the island adore him like a deity and take the statue and sign very seriously. They have a statue of him in the town square with that phrase on it. Well, one day, a letter falls off the sign. The town holds a meeting and the council decides to ban the letter that falls off. As more and more letters fall off, more and more letters get banned from usage. OK, fine, you say. What's the deal, why do you hate it?\n\nWell, the book is written in first person perspective from residents on the island via letters they write to each other. So, as letters get banned, the way the book is physically written changes. It becomes such a fucking headache to figure out what these people are saying because they've gotta come up with new, weird ways to spell words in order to work around the letter bans. And because more and more letters fall as the book progresses, it becomes more and more convoluted.

It was the little tumbling rock that kicked off an avalanche of re-evaluation of what I was buying into, the awful vision of a world devoid of human empathy, love of nature, general humanity.\n\nSo for the most part, I have completely rejected her views. There was much more - her weird sexual assault love scenes, her love of 80-page court drama monologues, and the complete hypocrisy how she carried on in her personal life (interfering in the marriage of her assistant that she was mentoring) while demanding strict adherence and loyalty to her ideas.\n\nSo imagine how funny it has been to me to see this resurgence of her writings, promoted by people that clearly have not read her books carefully, or are cynically using those concepts to manipulate less experienced minds for their own ends.

Honestly I feel bad for you if you never get emotional over books, that's one of the most fun parts about the hobby of reading to me.",

I have no idea why it would have been but whatever, people react to things in all kinds of ways.  \n\nI enjoy books for the world it creates in my imagination.  You are correct that I do not get emotional over them though.  I did not know that was a requirement for reading books.  You have taught me now though, I will read in a completely new way going forward.\n\n  \n:)",

There can be books written poorly and there can be books that I just do not like but those are not reasons to be mad.  I can be disappointed I suppose.  Maybe the concept for the book is really good but something about the way it is written is not what I want.  Or it is part of a series and the direction it goes is not what I expect or any number of other reasons.  But still cannot get mad at an artist for not doing what I want them to do and I can not get mad at the art just because I do not like it.",
