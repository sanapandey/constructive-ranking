    "selftext": "Loved this short read! At around 200 pages, it\u2019s a quick one, but since I\u2019m used to heavier books, it felt like a refreshing change. For me, this easily falls into the fantasy category. I struggle with books that don\u2019t allow me to vividly picture scenes within minutes, but this one had no such issue\u2014I was instantly immersed. The tea ceremony, in particular, played out so clearly in my mind, as if I were watching it unfold in real time.\n\nI also loved how traveling through time shaped each character\u2019s perspective, even when they couldn\u2019t change the present. It added such a poignant layer to the story. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a beautifully immersive, Ghibli-coded read!",

If you enjoyed this, I'd also recommend What You Are Looking for is in the Library.",

Shows you everyone can use a little bit of trauma magical cures in their life",
