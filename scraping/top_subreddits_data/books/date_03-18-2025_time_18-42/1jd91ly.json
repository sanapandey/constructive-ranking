The characters grow, we commiserate, we identify, we cheer; all within a setting that the author knows intimately well, painting a picture of life through the seasons, seen through souls whose eyes move through the grasses of the down, and whose perceptions are formed from a physical place where only a human's foot passes. If one were to read the plot alone, it wouldn't seem like the freshest storyline, but Richard Adams does it justice and then some. Although I took issue with what I saw as some character-based contrivances, they just didn't mute the novel's impact, especially in its epilogue, up to its very last line.",

In Sandleford, Efrafa & even Watership, that was the case. It may be of the times as you say, or perhaps because we weren't introduced to Sandleford that way, it would make sense that the other two warrens would be the same too, as was the rabbits' natural wont.\n\nI'm just speculating of course, and it is up to each reader to give Adams the benefit of the doubt or not, but considering the care he gives to other, arguably weaker characters, my take is that it was a result both of attitudes that hadn't evolved, and a depiction of a more Darwinian social hierarchy and order that really doesn't reflect so rigidly in human social structures (structures that have shown at least a willingness to adapt over generations).",

In so many books the general idea is \u201cI hate him, but he\u2019s the most beautiful man alive and I can\u2019t stop thinking about him\u201d, but the author did such a good job expressing genuine hatred with some decent development on how feeling change throughout the book.

I don\u2019t think this book was scary by any means but right from the beginning the descriptions/tone made me feel unsettled. After ~40% I couldn\u2019t stop listening. I enjoyed how this book made me question myself/my understanding of what was going on as the main characters perception of events was challenged by what the other characters were saying. I\u2019ve already recommended this audiobook to another person. \n\nStarted: \nEmpire of Silence by Christopher Ruocchio\nI\u2019ve been waiting to start this series because I was hoping Pierce Browns last Red Rising book would be coming out so I could read Lightbringer and go straight into the last one, but it seems we\u2019re still in a holding pattern there. So I\u2019ve decided to kick the Sun Eater series off.

It gives you an insight into what shaped Ballard\u2019s writing and somewhat warped perception of the world. For all the gruesome subjects that Ballard often writes about, I\u2019ve come to love his prose, which I struggled to recognise in this novel; with the exception of a few passages (the boy in the broken mirror being my favourite), it was quite unremarkable and stripped of any idiosyncrasies characteristic to his other novels but I suppose that\u2019s not surprising given the personal nature of this book. A fascinating and disturbing read.  \n\n**Hoka! Hoka! Hoka!, by Poul Anderson**  \nScrewball tales of cosplaying \u201cEwoks\u201d. I did not expect this level of manic energy in one book. The Don Jones story had me proper belly laughing and I couldn\u2019t help but think of the French taunting King Arthur scenes in the Monty Python and the Holy Grail whilst listening to the *Tiddlywink Warriors*.\n\n**The Vampyre, by John William Polidori**  \nVampire horror is perhaps my least favourite genre of horror but I still felt compelled to read the story that sparked all this fascination with the undead blood craving creatures of the night . This took me down the rabbit hole of early vampire sources, so I also read Lord Byron\u2019s *The Giaour* and *Fragment of a Novel*, the latter of which served as the foundation for Polidori\u2019s story. I\u2019ve also read a short poem called *The Vampyre* by John Stagg, which I believe was the first known mention of the vampiric myth in the Western literature (and which Polidori mentioned in his introduction), and Th\u00e9ophile Gautier\u2019s *Clarimonde*, a beautiful tale of a female vampire.  \n\nI forgot how much I enjoyed Gautier\u2019s writing, so decided to check out *My Private Menagerie*, which is his personal account of some of the animals with whom he shared his life. Cats, a parrot, rats, dogs, and horses, the book gushed with his love for these creatures. No one is perfect and neither was Gautier but it was interesting to have that insight into a life of a 19th century Frenchman. And sure, he completely anthropomorphises those animals but who of us doesn\u2019t, when they become members of our family.  \n\n***  \n\nSTARTED:  \n\n**The Drowned World, by J.G. Ballard**",

It has left me conflicted in my beliefs. \n\nHere\u2019s my review on Goodreads: \n\u201c3.5 stars.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to like this book, but I do. I hate that I like it.\n\nSomeone challenged me to read it and bet I couldn\u2019t finish. They were almost right. Some parts were boring, but the plot was great. However, the long soliloquies of characters spouting philosophical babble made my eyes glaze over.\n\nDespite Rand\u2019s advocacy for capitalism and self-interest, LOVE seems to be the central theme. I have conflicting feelings about the Dominque-Howard love connection, as it was forged by dubious means. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s truly love or just a power grab.\n\nRand\u2019s promotion of capitalism and self-interest doesn\u2019t negate the theme of love. Love for power, greed, mankind, self, and person are all explored. I found myself more engaged during the parts when the characters showed tenderness.\n\nSome parts of the book made me question my worldview. For example, Roark\u2019s testimony at the end, where he says, \u201cEvery major horror of history was committed in the name of an altruistic motive,\u201d made me reflect on current events and the administration\u2019s crusade to purify literature, people, and workplaces in the name of altruistic motive.\u201d",

What can I say about this semi-autobiographical anti-novel? It has every content warning I could imagine. It was justifiably banned and labeled obscene. It is a sort of stream of consciousness written by a heroin addict. It's written in a non-linear, \"cut up\" style that can be read in any order.

I forgot how much I liked this book. Lightsong is easily my favorite character as nearly everything he does makes me laugh out loud.\n\n**Emma, by Jane Austen**\n\nOne of those /r/bookclub books that sucks me in. I'm reading the annotated version with notes from David B. Shapard. This book is chonky and the notes are absolutely fascinating.\n\n**Julius Caesar, by William Shakespeare**\n\nThe current play of the month over at /r/YearOfShakespeare. I've read this one numerous times since high school and enjoy it every time as it's one of my favorites by ol' Billy Shakes.\n\n**Inferno, by Dante Alighieri**\n\nIt's Lent again so it's time for my annual reading of the *Divine Comedy*. I'm reading the Anothony Esolen translation again as I found it to be a very readable translation. I'm about halfway through already and will probably be finished soon.\n\nDid Not Finish:\n\n**Paradise Lost, by John Milton**\n\nThe current book over at /r/ClassicBookClub. I just wasn't enjoying it. I may revisit this one at some point in the future. Probably when I'm not buried under a giant stack of books. I really need to stop starting books before I finish.\n\nFinished:\n\n**The Titan's Curse, by Rick Riordan**\n\nEpisode 3 in the still ongoing saga of Perseus Jackson. New friends. New enemies. We finished it in time to get it back to the library. We went and got a copy of the fourth book and will now be starting that one tonight.\n\n**The Mabinogion**\n\nFinished this one a little early. I did enjoy this collection of early Welsh stories even if they werea little confusing and strange. Of special interest to me was the early stories about King Arthur.\n\n**Mythos: The Greek Myths Reimagined, by Stephen Fry**\n\nI've always enjoyed the stories of Classical mythology ever since I was a wee lad way back in the late 80s/early 90s (one of my earliest memories is hearing the story of Perseus agasinst Medusa in kindergarten). That said, Stephen Fry's book was high enjoyable to me, especially his sometimes snarky footnotes. Yet another one of those /r/bookclub books that drew me in.\n\n**The Hound of the Baskervilles, by Arthur Conan Doyle**\n\nAnother of those /r/bookclub books. This one is my favorite of the four canonical Sherlock Holmes novels. I think it was the first Sherlock Holmes stories I remember being exposed to (again, probably in the late 80s or early 90s). Followed along with the aforementioned Stephen Fry's excellent narration.\n\nContinuing:\n\n**Middlemarch, by George Eliot**\n\nKeeping up with the /r/YearOfMiddlemarch group. Like I've said before, I'm noticing a lot of little details and foreshadowing that gets overlooked by a first time reader.\n\n**Ship of Magic, by Robin Hobb**\n\nBook one of the *Liveship Traders* set of stories (and fourth overall in the *Realm of the Elderlings*). I'm really enjoying the world building and I'm dying to know where this set of stories will go and whether or not we will meet some familiar faces from the first set of books. Yet another of those /r/bookclub books.\n\n**Barnaby Rudge, by Charles Dickens**\n\nLast and certainly not least in my giant stack of books. I've been following the original publication plan from *Master Humphrey's Clock* and reading a weekly issue a day (*Master Humphrey's Clock* ran for 88 weekly issues and contained some shorter stories as well as the novels *The Old Curiosity Shop* and this one, *Barnaby Rudge*). At this rate, I've got about two weeks left to go.",

I think for me, book 2 was the strongest, it also has my favorite scene in the whole series (so far. I'm still reading book 5). Book 5 is .... dude needs a better editor, as much as I still enjoy the story, this book in particular (and arguably book 4) just suffer a lot unnecessarily from poor editing. In book 4 it's mostly length. In book 5 it's mostly length and some just... Sandersonian humor that is too childish and should've been cut.

The body horror in this was great but the main plot was kind of confusing and there were several subplots that felt disjointed and hard to follow. I gave this 3 stars.\n\n**When We Lost Our Heads, by Heather O\u2019Neill**, historical fiction inspired by Marie Antoinette that tells the story of two young girls who become best friends for better or for worse. This was FANTASTIC, it will definitely be in my top books of the year. 5 stars on Fable, six stars in my heart.\n\n**The Starving Saints, by Caitlin Starling**, medieval horror fantasy about a castle under siege which is \u201crescued\u201d by a group of saints that may not be what they seem. It\u2019s sapphic, atmospheric, and suuuuuper unsettling.

There were definitely points in the story where I questioned out it could end, and it took me a lot of analysis to really understand all of the element McCarthy tried to include in this novel. \n\nThe development that \u201cthe boy\u201d undertook throughout the journey is nothing short of a coming of age story. By the end of the book, he\u2019s lost most of his innocence, but the main lessons his father tried to teach him persist. He maintained the goodness he had in the beginning, even when his father didn\u2019t show that same \u201cgoodness\u201d throughout the story. The boy acted as his fathers conscience, meanwhile his father repeatedly reassured the boy that they were the good guys. If it wasn\u2019t for the boy, the father would be no better than the thieves and bandits he dispatched throughout their journey.\n\nI would recommend this book, however it will be a tough read for many due to McCarthy\u2019s writing style and pacing.",

It slips whenever they forget to lie and pretent about themselves. See when Bunny descends into anger. When he gets mean to them he suddenly forgets his uptight language. Same as Richard when he talsk to Judy, in the Winter part or close to the end of the book, when they have the last argument at the Hotel. In such a way the language, to me was used to give the reader a sense of the fakeness. Aboput how these students pretend so much that there is nothing of themselves left. Henry describes it as the murder suddenyl making him feel like everyting got color and life was actually happening.\n\nBunny who is painted as the biggest liar and misfit ac tually saw through all of them while they were still leading each other on.\n\nStill searching for why Julien was suipposed to be the catalysator for this.",

You would probably like a thread I saw here on [amazing bookstores around the world](https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/comments/1ickujn/what_are_some_must_see_book_stores_around_the/). I added my favorite, one I visited in Bucharest called C\u0103rture\u0219ti Carusel.",

But there's a lot of the worldbuilding happening in the first books that doesn't get explained in the later books as well as past events between the characters that build their relationships. So it really depends on whether you'd be okay with missing out on the bigger picture and worldbuilding.",

I\u2019ve read very little so far, taking it slow, but what I have read has been great. It has been interesting to see the differences between the show and book (so far I prefer all the book over show changes).

I read Salem's Lot last year and something about his style does not vibe with me. I remember him and George RR Martin did an interview together and he mentioned he writes by quota, meaning if he says he will do 15 pages a day, that's how much he'll do. And I feel like I can see that in his writing.\n\nI'm not denying he's a prolific horror author; the world would not be the same without him and I love Mike Flanagan's adaptions of his work and of course Stanely Kubrick's film. He is successful time and again so I'm not denying he doesn't know what he's doing to a degree. But I do not enjoy his work.",

Three women in Cameroon rebel (in their own way) against the oppressive system of forced marriages, polygamy and domestic abuse which they've grown into. I was ready to be emotionally wrecked, but this story not only did that but has a tight grip on my life now. I received this last Wednesday evening. I started reading the first pages and could not stop until I was done. I annotated and wrote in the margins of this book like a madwoman. This is a powerful and important read which gives you insight into some of the cultural traditions held in Cameroon. The author herself was forced to marry an older man in her teens, and this story draws a lot from her real-life experiences. Absolutely going to be my favourites of the year and will stick with me forever. I need everyone in my real-life circle to read this. \n* **Don't Look In My Basement by Mariel Mattera**. \n\nCurrently reading: \n\n* **The Wedding People by Alison Espach** (50%). Pheobe, on the cusp of a divorce, goes to a hotel to >!commit suicide!< but stumbles upon being the only person in the hotel not there for a big wedding. Her plans fall through, and she becomes part of the wedding. I expected this to be an Elin Hilderbrand beachy read with possibly more emotional depth, but I am disappointed so far. I am hoping that as I continue to read, it gets better. \n* **Parable of the Sower by Octavia E. Butler** (18%). I am not that far along but I am getting heavy 5 star feelings.",

The writing style between these two authors is immediately obvious. City of Dusk reads like a young adult novel on the verge of being more adult. I have had the book for over a year and  started/stopped it several times because of how juvenile the first few chapters felt. I finally committed to just getting through it, to clear it from my \"to be read\" pile.  It wasn't an unenjoyable read, but I knew shortly after finishing the book that I would not be picking up the next entry in the series. Conversely, The Assassin's Apprentice has a complexity and maturity to the writing that pulls you in and keeps you turning the pages, eager to learn more. Character development and world building done exceptionally well. There are 16 books in Hobb's Realm of the Elderling series, with the book I'm reading being the first of the 16. I have seen reviews indicating the books get progressively more entertaining so I don't think it's a stretch for me to confidently say I will likely read them all.",

When I charitably suggested to my friends that that was okay because it's probably in LOTR, they said no, it's largely in the textbook. The celebrated world building isn't in the novels? Great. The writing is very straight which is fine for an adventure, but it's not particularly special. \n\nI have tried so many times to get into this series because it's this weird gap in my nerd background and I want to fix that.

Elves as beatiful magical high class people? The Hobbit, (Norse elves are spirit/god like and not well described). Dwarves? Mostly the hobbit (Norse dwarves could shapeshift, Germanic ones tended to turn invisible, they tend to appear only briefly to give some enchanted weapon). Etc. etc. etc.\n\nThe story itself is very much a kindly man reading a silly, imaginative adventure to children that becomes poignant only right at the very end, because that's exactly what it is, a story Tolkien made up for his kids. If it's not you're thing, or even if you were expecting something different I can easily see being disappointed. But, as Terry Pratchett put it\n\n\"J.R.R. Tolkien has become a sort of mountain, appearing in all subsequent fantasy in the way that Mt. Fuji appears so often in Japanese prints. Sometimes it\u2019s big and up close. Sometimes it\u2019s a shape on the horizon. Sometimes it\u2019s not there at all, which means that the artist either has made a deliberate decision against the mountain, which is interesting in itself, or is in fact standing on Mt. Fuji.\" So if you didn't see the world building, it's because you're so used to reading/engaging with fantasy standing on top of the figurative Mt. Fuji of this very book (and the LOTR after) that you didn't even realize it was there.",

            "body": "Surprisingly, I have a lot this week. **I finished the Old Testament from the King James Bible of various authors, starting from Isaiah and going all the way to the end.**  \n  \nI had surgery to repair a broken medical device last week, and although I\u2019m still recovering, it was faster than expected and I felt well enough to finish the Old Testament same night as the surgery (it was one where you go home after, but they were fine with me spending some extra time in the hospital that day making sure the anesthesia wore off properly). I then finished the New Testament in one shot a few days later. it was a fair bit shorter and easier to read, so it made sense to finish it all at once.  \n  \nI had an interesting experience with the doctors and us all enjoy literature together before the surgery, including the Bible. One of them asked how I felt about the surgery. I had been preparing for advising so I could send them for classes later that month, so I told them I was just eager to get better and move on so I could do that. This lead to a discussion of my major major in different books, including the Bible that I was currently reading. It turns out they were all book lovers too, It made the whole experience less nerve-racking, and was a really pleasant conversation and a good distraction. It just showed the power of literature in general, and how literature can provide experiences that can be shared by anyone regardless of the circumstance. Regardless of what was going on I thought that was very cool!  \n  \nI like Daniel and enjoyed how it was written. It was almost like a chance as the false gods were named for their sins. I especially lied to the writing of the proclamations, and that someone saw the lights instead of another death. I also enjoyed reading about the beasts and the fire streams, enjoy the more supernatural things.  \n  \nThe smaller parts of the end of the Old Testament blurred together a bit, but I really love the rhetoric. It\u2019s still felt like chants and I enjoyed that style. It just felt familiar and almost natural, maybe like poetry. However, I\u2019ve always had a tough time interpreting poetry and writing it, so maybe that\u2019s not where it comes from.  \n  \nI can feel the power in the verses and the descriptions, especially when God speaks to the disciples or converts, and says what He wants and needs. it didn\u2019t particularly feel like that when someone was being punished, but maybe that was because I didn\u2019t like the death and killing so much and was put off by that.  \n  \nIt actually reminded me of my old high school history teacher, who was a sweet woman but not very good at teaching. She loved ancient history and would talk your ear off about it. She was the one that taught me about ancient writings, like Confucianism and Buddhism. A lot of this particular writing reminds me of that for some reason, even with something like the cycles of reincarnation and Nirvana.  \n  \nAt the time I didn\u2019t really appreciate what my teacher was trying to teach me, and was more annoyed that she wasn\u2019t that good at getting students to understand or planning her classes. My professional writing and analysis classes wouldn\u2019t really go into high gear until about a year with my first AP courses. So I wasn\u2019t really as good at recognizing the similarities between texts, deciphering rhetoric, or analyzing different literary styles. Now that I have those skills and looking back as an adult, I can really appreciate those writings and the similarities. It feels like a bit of an odd comparison, but it was cool that it brought the memories back.",

            "body": "I remembered Jonah and how bizarre it was, but because of that I liked it. It was easier to remember and I feel like it\u2019s more direct. I remember it was one of my favorite stories as a child, especially with the bizarreness and the direct writing style. But I feel like it contrasts so much with the rest of the Bible that it comes out of nowhere. But that makes it one of the events I really remember.  \n  \nI found out one of the reasons the king James Bible was very familiar was because it was used by Catholicism. I live next to a Catholic Church growing up and thus was a Catholic. My mother also grew up Catholic so it was the Christianity category of my family was most familiar with as a whole. She pointed out that my first exposure to the Bible as a child was probably the king James version, which is why it feels so familiar to me and why I\u2019m recognizing the style. I thought that was pretty cool. Nowadays, I live in North Carolina where Catholicism isn\u2019t very common and currently live near other churches, but it was interesting that I had that experience growing up.\n\nThe New Testament is more familiar and is not as long. I recognize most of the major events like the birth of Jesus and the journey of Mary and Joseph, so it was easier to follow along. I enjoyed hearing the prophecies because I wasn\u2019t familiar with the actual words or the words that the people who would visit Jesus would say. it was definitely a bit chilling but well written and I still like the rhetoric.  \n  \nI also noticed the healing scenes Where Jesus started healing people that were very sick and how inspiring that was. Even more inspiring was the rhetoric and trying to envision what it was like the first read that or study it deeply. I figured there must\u2019ve been an event that inspired the stories and wondered what would be like to attend, even if the miracles themselves were fantastical. Whatever inspired someone to write that story was not fantastical, they wrote it very well, and that story in the end was the Bible. It just reinforces the whole idea of for me about how it\u2019s not so much whether the Bible was absolutely true or not but someone wrote a story, a really good story that spoke to many people, and it\u2019s a very strong example of how powerful that is here.  \n  \nI\u2019m surprised I\u2019ll quickly things move in the New Testament. The most popular events seem to be the birth of Jesus, the initial prophecies, the death, and the resurrection. That seems like a lot so I thought it would be spread out. instead it takes up the first book of the New Testament, and the rest is either recounting what happened or spreading the word of the gospel until the prophesied end of the world. The New Testament was a lot faster than the old one in general, with a lot of the books being up about half the length of the Old Testament if that. I was able to read it all in one go and there was no way I could\u2019ve done that with the Old Testament.  \n  \nI recognized more like the miracles and the different things Jesus preached, but I like the descriptions of the Old Testament more because it seems like there was more of a mystical element and a bit of an ominous tone. This was demystified in the New Testament, which didn\u2019t make it as interesting to read. I get that that was by design, but it wasn\u2019t as enjoyable for me. It was more about the politics, the preaching, and the talking. It makes sense because a lot of the major conflicts are over and the new world is being established because the conflicts are no longer there. it\u2019s slower pacing and appeal to a lot of people though, so that\u2019s not necessarily bad. It was still cool to see.  \n  \nRevelations was its own case as I knew that was basically a separate thing. I am reminded of going on the tongue and cheek analysis site TV Tropes and looking up the Bible one day. TV tropes has summaries of many different things, including books, TV, films, and even video games. there\u2019s different commentary on it, as the areas are separated in literary devices and put into different categories. One of the categories revelations was put into was none other than \u201cWhat do you mean it wasn\u2019t made on drugs?\u201d Actually reading it, I thought it earned that title because of how random it was. I liked the supernatural occurrences but it felt like it was a bunch of crazy monsters appearing at random. Considering it was supposed to be a vision though, that makes sense.",

            "body": "I have mixed feelings on the Bible now that I\u2019ve finally finished it. I thought it was going to be long and difficult. However, while it was long it wasn\u2019t necessarily difficult. I didn\u2019t do a serious reading so were a lot of events I didn\u2019t understand even though I understood most of the major ones. However, I absolutely could understand and respect more about why people are so captivated and moved by it, And why is so many words are inspired by it. There\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s the best selling book of all time and nothing comes close, and I definitely understand that reason now. I enjoyed the rhetoric all the way through as well.  \n  \nI enjoyed the Old Testament over the New Testament, which was a surprise, but the New Testament focused on cleaning up the aftermath so to speak as opposed to the mystique of the Old Testament. So it wasn\u2019t as interesting for me. I did try to read a summary but those were too long and intense to stick with.  \n  \nAs stated before, I usually use TV tropes, because I like the fact that they are Tongue In Cheek and use a lot of literary references in addition to summaries. Usually when I read something from them I read both the references and the summaries. As someone that understands literary devices I feel like I learned a lot about the work and get a great idea of what the work is about. Plus they also give me a good laugh. I tried doing this with the Bible and realizing I\u2019m getting halfway through Genesis was taking me an hour. this would have to do with no time for anything else, so I just scanned the short summaries and decided to leave it alone.  \n  \nIf I really wanted to study the Bible, I absolutely would\u2019ve read everything, but as it is I didn\u2019t want to run out of time for other things I would probably enjoy more so I just decided to let it go. interestingly, my mom is currently seriously studying in the Bible, and asked for all the detailed summaries instead. I thought that was pretty cool because she does like to read, but the higher level literature with the literary analysis is something she\u2019s not normally into. she does think it\u2019s interesting and understands the importance thanks to that being my professional life. But it\u2019s not something she can do on her own most of the time because her background is completely different (physical therapy and healthcare) and it can be difficult for her to understand when I try to talk about it. so when I did that it felt like I was sharing some of my world with her, and she was interested in seeing the book she was reading in more detail. So I thought that was really cool.  \n  \nAnd here ends my journey with reading classical literature for fun in general, at least until after grad school sometime. I ended up having a greater appreciation for it and the circumstances in which it was written. However, that didn\u2019t necessarily mean I knew what it was trying to say, and I still had to look at the historical context behind it a lot of of times if I wasn\u2019t directly looking up a summary.  \n  \nI can understand why my professors taught it the way they did. A lot of what was being was about what the books were about and less about how to find something like symbolism, historicism, and literary devices. Often times it was very direct like a symbol means a certain thing and that\u2019s it. It wasn\u2019t until my junior year of high school that I had a professor that taught people how to use those devices including symbolism by themselves and explain how why someone should look for them when reading (or at least be trained to know how to find them if they weren\u2019t actively looking).  \n  \nI really enjoyed doing that and that inspired me to go into literary analysis professionally when I already had a strong foundation. I enjoyed doing it ever since. the same couldn\u2019t be said for a lot of my classmates, though, as my professor was pretty hands off and try to encourage us to do our own discussions. A lot of my classmates struggled without guided instruction and would just shut down. So I definitely feel like there needs to be a balance.",

            "body": "So I would probably do half-and-half where I would focus on what the text says (I currently mainly teach both college and older high school, so I\u2019m envisioning that, but particularly college). However, I would probably add some text to world into my explanations about how it relates to the world at large or if it relates to something a student might have read. I probably would stick to general concepts or historical events to avoid super sensitive things like politics (I\u2019ve seen instructors go off the deep end with those; it\u2019s ugly). I would sure have to be prepared for sensitive subjects, though but teachers are taught to be neutral when teaching it, so that would probably help.  \n  \nI\u2019d probably throw some historicism in there so that people can understand the history and why it was important. Of course I would try to teach literary devices and literary analysis and how to use and find them. However, I would never just completely turn my students loose unless they had that foundation so what happened to my classmates wouldn\u2019t happen, or at least be minimized.  \n  \nOverall, I think teaching the class in my own class versus helping to tutor someone else who\u2019s struggling and someone else\u2019s class like I\u2019m doing right now would be interesting. However, I took a lot away from them reading them both as a more casual reader and an aspiring professor. I also studied them my own classes and most likely continue to as I head into graduate school this fall. It was a good exercise, but now I\u2019m ready to head to some into some light content. I have several things lined up, so I can\u2019t wait!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0",
