    "selftext": "I am an avid reader but I do not enjoy all genres, and there is a particular genre of fiction that I simply do not enjoy. I have tried many times to read books from this genre but have only ever succeeded in completing and enjoying one or two. The rest just became DNFs. It's just not my thing. \n\nWhen this topic has come up in discussion with one of my friends he immediately says \"the setting is the setting, it doesn't affect the story.\" He says that if the core story is good and essentially the same in a romance novel, a sci-fi novel, a horror novel, etc., that it should not impact anyone's enjoyment. He says it makes no sense for anyone to say they don't like a certain setting because if the story is told well, then it's irrelevant. \n\nThis weird take blows my mind. He generally LOVES to be a contrarian and seems to really enjoy disagreeing with me no matter how trivial the subject--even passing comments like this he will turn into a \"you're wrong\" thing. Thank you, I am wrong when I say I do not enjoy XYZ. He will even take an opposing stance and try to argue against my opinion on books, video games, and movies that he has never read, never played, never seen. So this may just be one more (in my opinion) idiotic take he has just to find a way to disagree with me. \n\nBut just for my own information, I want to know if many people share that same view? ",

You could have a story, and then you can find examples of that story with different set dressing. Core story is the same, but the setting is different. Die Hard is basically \"a group takes over some location and take some hostages. Unbeknownst to them, there's a lone wolf loose, who begins to take them down, ultimately winning in a showdown with the villain's leader.\" More or less. \n\nYou can slap horror theme on it (30 Days of night) or make it a comedy (Airheads) or Sci-Fi (the third act of Fifth Element) or a kid's movie (Home Alone) or a Christmas movie (Violent Night). \n\nThe part where your friend is just being contrarian is the \"it makes no sense for anyone to say they don't like a certain setting...\" which is just utter bullshit. books are a subjective experience, and we all like different things. If someone *doesn't like horror*, then slapping a horror theme on an otherwise good story is going to mean that person doesn't like it, *because they don't like horror.* \n\nMost people don't read books (or watch movies) *just* for the story. They're reading for the *total package*. The setting will impact the tone. It will impact how graphic it is. It will guide dialogue and characterization. The world building. If you don't like horror, then you're not going to like 30 Days of Night, even if you loved Die Hard. *Because it's still horror*.",

In theory genres should be broad enough to appeal to everyone, but that's not really true in real life.\n\n\nLet's take fantasy as an example. In theory fantasy could contain all kinds of fantastical elements and could have all kinds of story structures, but it's often very tropey. I recently read/listened to three books with dragons (from different authors) in a row and I didn't even seek out books with dragons intentionally. They also all were set in fantasy Europe/almost Europe; one was more medieval and two were more early modern period inspired. One of them also had fantasy Asia. So there are quite a few similarities just in worldbuilding in those books from different authors. If one doesn't like the tropes or structure that's common in a genre then one won't like the genre.\n\n\nSo your friend's opinion doesn't really make much sense in reality.

Of course he's entitled to his opinion, but I'd counter him by brining up that in a vast majority of novels, the setting-- which people often use to define a book's genre-- (I have my own thoughts about this) is like an additional character.\n\nThe Southern Reach trilogy, for instance, hinges on setting-- that plot couldn't exist in that form if not for the setting. Then there's Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel-- does he not believe in historical fiction? Or Gilead by Marilynne Robinson a theological meditation on a specific time and place in the U.S.-- none of those books could be what they are without setting.\n\nCloud Atlas by David Mitchell is an interesting experiment in genre-bending, though, but I think it's a novel that would prove this point. Setting is crucial, it's a character of its own.",

Do you like space and robots? This sci-fi novel has space and robots. Does gore and cynicism make you uncomfortable? This is a horror novel, so you should probably just ignore it. A good story is useless if nobody reads it, labeling it as a genre will act as a foot in the door for getting it into the hands of select genre fans.\n\nSecond, there is a different milage you can gain out of a settings value to a story and the enjoyment of it. You can definitely enjoy stories of various settings, but some settings might do a good job attracting people out of novelty. History buffs will love to read a historical fiction book set in a niche period they like. Some locals will be more likely to buy a book that takes place in their city. \n\nSetting is also tangential to the story itself. A story that requires isolation can't take place on a crowded subway at rush our. A story about physical exploration can't take place entirely in ones kitchen.",
