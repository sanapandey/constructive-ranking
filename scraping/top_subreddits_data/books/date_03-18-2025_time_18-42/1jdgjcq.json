What's cool is after watching the Bosch series and thinking I remembered all his books, I got nostalgic and started reading them again in order.  Its fascinating!!  30 years later and my memory of each book was barely correct, so it was new again in some ways, but the most amazing part is I could actually remember what I was doing and what I was like when I first read them.  I could actually break free old memories I'd forgotten and it was like a time machine.  Its been so cool to remember what I was thinking about life and the book at that time and compare it to what I know now.  Fucking amazing!  Highly recommend it because I've started rereading a lot of my old authors and its been an amazing journey.  Highly recommend this!",

I wish more authors were able to commit to being so accessible.\n\nAlso, I love the shows. It's easy to see that he's very involved in their production.",

I used to eagerly look forward to every new release, but I do think the series started to \"jump the shark\" by around The Overlook, the one where he was exposed to a supposedly \"lethal\" dose of radiation. I'm also not super impressed with the recent Renee Ballard stuff-- she feels like a fairly shallow Connelly creation. But this seems like a pattern with a lot of my favorite creators. By the time they get acknowledged by the \"mainstream\", they're often past their best years creatively.",

            "body": "My review of A Darkness More than Night: \n\t\nThis is the worst, most disjointed, most chaotically plotted book I have ever read. I had to take several sheets of paper and two pens (one black, one red) to try and make sense of what was happening. This \u201cmap\u201d I made of the book shows that it has two plots running in parellel; one is the description of a murder trial in a courtroom, featuring Harry Bosch as the leading investigator, and the other describes a completely separate murder of someone called Gunn that is being investigated by someone else called McCaleb. McCaleb knows Bosch but apart from that the two plots have no relationship one to the other. \n\nThere are false trails that lead nowhere, and red herrings that take up a lot of time (and fill a lot of pages) but are ultimately meaningless, one of which is a completely pointless sub-plot about a plastic owl and the works of the Renaissance painter Hieronymous Bosch, which includes a lengthy, detailed visit to the Getty Museum, along with the introduction of a whole cast of extra characters, that ends up meaning nothing. \n\nRight up to the end of the book, new characters are being brought in, with stories around them, who had never been mentioned before, such as Jamal Hendricks, who is introduced as a witness in the court case and had a key role that Bosch knew about as part of his early investigations but that we were not told about. \n\nMeanwhile Bosch\u2019s friend McCaleb, who appears to be an idiot, thinks Bosch was responsible for the other completely unrelated murder and decides to pursue him. \n\nLike the other Connelly books I\u2019ve read, this is a tedious, heavily padded, long-drawn-out crime novel that appears to have been made as long as possible, for no other reason than to make it last. \n\nIt is not until the very end that Connelly makes a rather pathetic attempt to tie together his two plots by creating a link, via a particular character that had never played a major role and is suddenly given great prominence because his brother suddenly appears. Don\u2019t read this if you want to keep your sanity",
