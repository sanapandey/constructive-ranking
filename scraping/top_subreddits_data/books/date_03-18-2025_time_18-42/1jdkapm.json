    "selftext": "So I recently finished reading The Gift, and just had to write a few things about it while its still fresh in my mind. Firstly, I love Nabokov's prose and style of writing that never ceases to almost carry you as if you were at sea, yet at times his excessive detailing (especially in the book within a book that is chapter 4), felt a little bit draining. Despite this though, I found it a genius work of writing, his ability to shift between perspectives so fluidly, and to be able to change his writing style so many times is very admirable. Anyways, I just wanted to hear others thoughts on the book.",

            "body": "While Lolita is definitely more famous/popular, I think The Gift is Nabokov's crown achievement and generally the best work. I remember going to a local book store and seeing massive tomes of critical analysis of The Gift that were many times larger than the story itself.\n\nBut yeah, for anyone interested in how a writer thinks or creates, this is a must-read. Personally, I was deeply touched by the depiction of protagonist's relationship with Zina and the story of his father. The entire chapter on the life and work of Chernishevsky was illuminating, too.",
