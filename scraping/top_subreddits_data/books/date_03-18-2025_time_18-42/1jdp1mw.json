    "selftext": "I remembered really enjoying the *Jalna* books by Mazo de la Roche in my youth, and was wondering how they hold up. She was a best seller in her day. I couldn't find any at either of my local libraries, which are quite good, but I tracked one down on Thriftbooks.\n\nI'm devouring it. I love her vivid descriptions of nature, and the way she loves each character individually. And I'm a sucker for a good family saga.\n\nI wonder why she has fallen so far from popularity. I'm not saying its Great Literature or anything, but IMO they're still Darn Good Books.\n\nAnyone else a fan? Would love to discuss.",

Her characters are 3-D and even now I can remember Adeline, Renny, Eden and Tod and many more.\n\nNot sure I'd want to revisit them now - they feel very much part of my earlier, teenage life - but I think they are very good. I hope you manage to track down the whole series, have you tried Abe Books? And it's likely Amazon does them cheaply on Kindle.",
