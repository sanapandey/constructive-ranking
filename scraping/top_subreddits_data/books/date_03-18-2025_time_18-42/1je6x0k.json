    "selftext": "I recently finished reading this trilogy of stories (The wild Shore, The Gold Coast, and Pacific Edge) and enjoyed the trio  both individually and as a combined commentary on the nature of the future.\n\nFor those of you who have read this trilogy I wanted to ask two simple questions: 1. Which of these stories was your favorite to read? 2. Which of these stories would you prefer to live in?\n\nI'm excited to hear your thoughts!",

But you're right, pacific edge is the type of society I would like to see our current society shift towards, a more practical utopia.",
