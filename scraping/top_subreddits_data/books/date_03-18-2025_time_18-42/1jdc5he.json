The federal cuts might not be a direct hit, but indirect to your city/county library.\n\nAs states and cities lose federal funding for OTHER spending, they will have to make up for it by cutting expenses like local libraries. \n\nSo, yes, this does affect local libraries. \n\nHang in there, librarians.

People are reading less than they have in a long, long time. They're not going to libraries to research nearly as much. There are so many options for free/cheap entertainment that you don't even have to leave home to use that libraries have had a hard time competing.\n\nWhen I was a kid, the library was where knowledge lived. Today, the library is where a small fraction of knowledge can be found. Slowly. And inconveniently.\n\nI still love libraries, but if I'm being honest, I don't go there anymore except out of nostalgia. For me, there's literally nothing a public library can do provide cannot be provided faster and more comprehensively by the internet.",

Putting aside the costs, the user experience is just a whole level worse for a library than the internet for 95% of the people who used to be the primary users of them. Contrast that with the internet experience, and it's clear why library foot traffic has fallen off drastically. Anything the internet can do, people use the internet for. There are things the library does better, but it's also so much more inconvenient that most people just don't bother.\n\nThat's the reason that libraries are under threat. That's *the* major reason why funding is being cut. Usage is down, and constituents don't care enough to defend it against cuts. Administrators will always try to cut everything; the primary weapon against budget cuts has always been the presence of energetic defenders.",

To early literacy programs. To summer reading programs for readers of all ages. To programs for verterans. To high speed internet access for all.\n\nI have already heard in my state of Michigan this will affect MeL/MeLCat which is our state-wide Inter-Library Loan. It will likely affect our Activity Pass program for our states largest library cooperative and many other things.\n\nI heard from NY library director that this will also hurt small, rural libraries. Speaking as a patron of a small rural library that offers very little that costs money, all we have left to cut is Libby. Then will come hours and such.\n\nI have been following posts on r/Libraries and r/LibbyApp and both contain links to explainations of funding. I found the more detailed funding websites from r/Libraries. I didn't save them however and due to having shit for vision I can't find them right now but they were there this weekend.\n\nI hope this helps offer more insight.",

There's a ton of shit that Trump et al are doing, and a ton to be mad about. Figuratively TONS of bullshit and probably unconstitutional actions. But for some reason, there's ALSO a ton of hyperbole and outright misinformation about what's being done. Even though we don't need any at all. What you said applies to everyone.\n\nFor example, this is accurate, too:\n\n> What complicates things further with Democrats is that \"the right\" is so heavily demonized that there is the added consideration that if a person acknowledges that they have made a mistake, it means that \"the conservatives\" were right about the Democrats all along, which is unfathomable.\n\nI know this will not be received well here (if redditors will even bother reading it!), because of **exactly** what you just said. No one is immune, and few are even trying to stay aware of misinformation coming from their \"allies\".\n\nCheck your sources. Don't take reported incidents at face value unless the sourcing is highly transparent and fact-based. If MSNBC reports something, that doesn't necessarily mean it's true, and it definitely doesn't mean it's got no spin on it. If FOX reports something, that doesn't necessarily mean it's false. Even more importantly, if you're getting your news from either one of those 2 places, just stop, because they're both party mouthpieces.",

            "body": "### Implications for Libraries:\n\n**Reduction in Funding and Support:**\n\nThe order calls for the elimination or significant reduction of non-statutory functions in the IMLS. This suggests that the agency may face budget cuts or potentially a reduction in its operational capacity. Libraries often rely on grants and funding from IMLS for various programs and initiatives. A reduction in financial support could adversely affect library services, community programs, educational outreach, and access to resources.\n\n\n**Impact on Library Programs:**\n\nLibraries benefit from various IMLS initiatives, such as promoting digital inclusion, enhancing educational opportunities, and supporting rural libraries. The reduction of IMLS functions could mean that existing programs may be scaled back or eliminated, directly impacting local libraries and the communities they serve.\n\n\n**Future Grant Opportunities:**\n\nThe directive in this order regarding the review and potential rejection of funding requests implies that libraries seeking support through IMLS grants may face increased challenges. If the agency\u2019s budget is reduced or its funding requests are rejected, libraries may find it more difficult to secure funding for new projects or initiatives.\n\n\n**Strategic Planning and Adaptation:**\n\nLibraries may need to adapt their strategic planning in light of reduced federal support. This could involve seeking alternative funding sources, including state and local funding, private donations, or partnerships with organizations to continue their programs.\n\n\n**Broader Impacts:**\n\nThe potential scaling back of IMLS operations may set a precedent for how government supports cultural institutions, including libraries. This could influence how libraries advocate for their value and the need for sustained or increased funding at various levels of government.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nOverall, the executive order presents significant concerns for libraries across the United States. The IMLS serves a crucial role in supporting library services and facilitating access to information, education, and cultural resources. If the agency is subjected to budget reductions or operational cutbacks as stipulated in the order, the repercussions could ultimately hinder the ability of libraries to serve their communities effectively. Libraries might need to proactively seek alternative support avenues and raise awareness about their critical role in education and community building during this period of potential uncertainty.\n\n\nSounds great, just as expected from the cheeto-in-chief. \n\n**Q:** Good grief, what else will he ruin?\n\n**A**: Everything",
