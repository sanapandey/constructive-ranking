They\u2019re so trash. \n\nOff the top of my head:\n\nSuper special girl who demanded her uncle go back and let out the horses because they might starve with no one to feed them. This was as they were *running for their lives* from soldiers. \n\nPredictably her uncle and cousin get caught and then she manages to make a fuss and her her aunt caught as well. \n\nNow, bear in mind they have close neighbours who are often over. Horses are fucking precious money makers (because they\u2019re horse *breeders*). There\u2019s no way in hell those horses would have been left to starve. \n\nDropped that book there. \n\nThen there was the one where they were on the run from the people who slaughtered the entire royal family bar her and there\u2019s an impending fight and it should be really tense but instead she\u2019s OwOing over his muscles and getting lost in the sexual tension instead of KEEPING A FUCKING LOOK OUT. \n\nThere was another book where it seemed pretty interesting and the main character seemed competent - until for some godforsaken reason she bets that she can seduce a random dude. And then does it so fucking badly. It\u2019s so cringe. \n\nOther things that have turned me off: \n\nCharacters who are rude and hostile for the sake of it.\n\nCharacters who force themselves into situations that are beyond their capabilities, against advice, and end up needing to be rescued when things predictably go wrong. \n\nCharacters who are incapable of using their brains. \n\nLike, I don\u2019t need my characters to be powerhouses that can handle anything thrown at them, yeah? But having at least two brain cells to rub together would be nice. \n\nTL;DR it\u2019s great for getting people into reading, but people who are already readers may have higher standards and find the books recommended somewhat akin to junk food when they\u2019re looking for something a bit better.",

Technically yes most types of genres will continue to be written in many forms, but for the casual reader, it has become very challenging to find certain types of books among the sea of what\u2019s popular. Not all of us have tons of time to dig into the more \u201cunknown\u201d titles, let alone read tons of books just to see if they\u2019re are good. Yes that is part of the fun for some, but then those people who are willing to search don\u2019t need to be marketed to in such excess.\n\nIf you equate it to TV, it is physically impossible for someone to watch everything, but they can use popularity lists, reviews, and word of mouth to determine what\u2019s even worth sitting down to watch. I think since a lot of the professional sources of this information have diminished in integrity, people have to increasingly rely on word of mouth which can be difficult if you have specific tastes.",

I work at a bookstore and we often receive large quantities of new romantasy releases, and smaller quantities of non-romantasy titles. This affects what titles are promoted. When you receive 10+ quantities of a romantasy title, and 3 of a non-romantic fantasy, the book you receive 10 copies of is much more likely to end up on a table, or faced out in section. This makes it much harder for customers to find newer non-romantasy titles, especially with authors who aren\u2019t established names like Sanderson. \n\nI think that was the point of this article. Unless you are following new releases closely, it\u2019s much harder to find non-romantic fantasy. The title is definitely click-bait but the author does state several times they have nothing against the genre.",

One of the most frequent suggestion requests on the romantasy subreddits is MORE world building. I think romantasy is really promising as a genre, but the speed at which titles are being produced & the emphasis publishers are placing on the romantic aspect of the genre does affect the quality of a lot of newer releases. \n\nI had a long conversation with a customer the other day where she was telling me what she liked & didn\u2019t like about various magic systems and world building in a lot of the popular releases. She had the same request for more world building. I think it does a disservice to romantasy readers to churn these titles out so quickly without giving the authors time to flesh out the fantasy aspects of the story. A lot of readers are just as interested in the fantasy side as they are the romance.\n\nEdit: I think this is why the Empyrean series is so popular. Romance is a focus but there is substantial world building as well.",

I live in Ontario, Canada and from Toronto to many small towns that are home to my favourite bookstores, bookstores are the best places to find your next read and often offer up some great hidden gems on top of that. \n\nIn Toronto we not only have Indigo, but an excellent used book chain called BMV that has extensive new/used sff titles in addition to an amazing sff independent bookstore that offers a store full of new and older releases (including an entire wall of new releases across sff that is definitely not romantasy-focused). That's on top of some great used bookstores. Yes, we could say Toronto is a big city so of course there will be options...yet even with all that some of my favourite bookshops are actually in towns like Perry Sound and Orangeville, among others. \n\nI would also add that local bookstores (at least over here) can easily order in books for you at no extra charge if they don't have it in stock. Literally cheaper than ordering it online yourself as you don't have to pay for shipping.",

I myself don't like wasting money on books I won't end up liking so I don't go picking up books based on things like interesting covers and what not. I usually look for spoiler free synopses or recommendations and those are way easier to get online. In a book store I have to pull the person aside, hope they have the same tastes as I do and that they read the new books when they come out which isn't always super likely and they're often less likely to have read a book than I myself am since I do read quite a bit I could look up  an older post with someone looking for recommendations and have 50 good recommendations in less time than it would take me to put on my shoes to go to the store. I could be more specific and ask for recommendations on here myself and get a bunch that I'd probably like. \n\nHere I don't mind paying a bit more to support small buisnesses but it's definitly faster and cheaper to get the book online. I remember a few years back I stopped into the local book store and asked for a book. They didn't have it but could order it and it would come in a week and cost me $38. I figured I'd look around to other bookstores since I'm inpatient. Ended up ordering it on amazon for $20 and had it delivered when I woke up the next morning. I live in a medium size town but amazon does a lot of same day or overnight deliveries now.\n\nI really liked that dungeon crawler carl series and I have recommended it several people who have all enjoyed it. When I ordered my brother's copy from the local bookstore I had to wait a week and it's true that I didn't have to pay anything for shipping but I did have to wait almost a week. I got my sister a copy this weekend and grabbed it on amazon for 75% of the price and they delivered it 4 hours after I ordered it which was convenient because she lives out of town and I was able to get it to her this weekend when she was in town rather than holding onto it for a few months till I see her again.\n\nThat being said I don't really have much of a dog in the fight anymore since I order most of my older books used from thriftbooks and most of my books I just get on kindle now with immediate delivery since I like to go for a walk and read after I put the kids to bed and ebooks are much more convenient for walking in the dark with while reading.",

I've heard basically no one who reads it has any idea what is going on in book 1 and then book 2  takes place with a completely different set of characters in a different part of the world then book 3 ties it together and gives the context to know what the hell was happening in book 1.\n\nRealm of the elderlings: This is robin hobb's main work. She does have a habit of putting her characters through the ringer so it can be a bit dark and bleak at some points. This one is split into trilogies which each tell their own story and any can serve as a conclusion to the story as a whole since there aren't really any cliffhangers at the end of the trilogies just like okay story is done and then the next one is like oh hey 20 years later more bad shit happens.\n\nSoldier's son trilogy: More robin hobb. more carnival of misery for her characters. This one is a standalone trilogy not related to her other series at all. It's a lot less popular for whatever reason but still good.\n\nbook of the ancestors: trilogy about assassin nuns.\n\nbook of ice: same author and same world as book of the ancestors but a very different story.\n\npowder mage trilogy: inspired by nepoleon  It's a military fantasy series. There's guns and what not. Not a lot in the way of magic except for the powder mages who can use gunpowder for some magic.\n\nthe black prism trilogy: more high fantasy version of the powder mage trilogy sort of. It's a world where some people can use different colors of light to do magic or create things. much softer magic system.\n\ndiscworld: Satirical fantasy books. Each one (except for the first 2) is a standalone book that takes place on the discworld. They can be read in any order though there is a canonical order but all you miss if you don't follow that are small little easter eggs like somoene might make a small reference to something that happened in a prior book. There are also a sort of sub series that follow certain characters like the witches books follow the witches and the guards books follow the guards etc and they might have a slightly more straightforward arc. Like if a certain guard character joins in the guards 2nd book then it might make sense to read that before the 3rd book where they're a major character.\n\nBloodsworn saga: Viking inspired fantasy with angry gods and what not.",

First time I\u2019ve ever found the \u201cenemies to lovers\u201d trope convincing. By the end I actually believed they were a good match who mutually respected and cared for each other.\n\n- A Brother\u2019s Price by Wen Spencer. Not really fantasy, but set in a somewhat fantastical constructed world. If you read a summary it sounds like the plot of a harem anime, but I promise it\u2019s actually well done. A fun, well-written action romance that has plenty of melodrama and romantic tension without feeling too contrived.",

But fair warning, I'm someone who genuinely like ACOTAR and SJM books, so idk if I'm the right person to recommend objectively good romantasy.\n\nSome of them are older: a lot of Nora Robert's fantasy romance novels are actually really REALLY good, though I like her more urban fantasy novels like the her Chronicles of the One series or Sign of the Seven series. The Circle trilogy has some classic fantasy elements, but there's also time-travel involved so a good chunk of it takes place in modern day.\n\nMost of what Laurel K Hamilton wrote is good - but hers are also urban fantasy. Same with Seanan McGuire. Honestly, I think the romantasy does best when it's urban fantasy, but that might be personal preference.\n\nSome of my newer recs: The Saint of Steel series by T Kingfisher is really good so far but I haven't finished it (I just started the first book).\n\nThe Last Sun by KD Edwards is excellent, but it is a queer romance which is honestly my preference. Hunger Pangs by Joy Demorra is really good. I liked what I read of the Faceless Mage by Kenley Davidson and A Lady of Rooksgrave Manor by Kathryn Moon. I've only read the samples of both of those though, so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nI have a few other queer romantasy, but I get the feeling that that's not what you're looking for so in summary, look at some older books Nora Roberts specifically is a personal fav, and her library is vast and if you don't mind urban fantasy, there are a lot of those that are pretty decent.",

First, because there is and has been a ton of non-romantasy female fantasy authors over the years (J.K. Rowling, Diana Wynne Jones, N. K. Jemisin, Frances Hardinge, Tanith Lee, Martha Wells, T. Kingfisher, Miya Kazuki, and I could go on for days if I tried to list all the ones I know about), and no one among fantasy fans ever had a problem with them because they were women. A lot of them won awards too or were bestselling authors. The majority of fantasy fans are not sexist. \n\nSecond, because romantasy books are explicitly written for women, like most romance books are. It is no wonder that men do not like them, when they are not the targeted public. And of course some men are going to get mad when romantasy fans keep trying to shove their books down their throat when they are just not interested, or when they go to the fantasy section of a bookshop and it is all smutty romantasy rather than the fantasy books they like. But I keep seeing romantasy fans claiming that men who don\u2019t want to read romantasy are sexist. They often are the ones trying to pick a fight with fantasy fans, rather than the opposite. \n\nAnd third, the reasons romantasy books are so popular with women is because they are shamelessy pandering to their chosen audience, and books that do that tend to be just not very good and unpopular with most people who do not belong to that audience. Romantasy books are no different from Japanese power fantasy harem isekai light novels in that respect (to give an example of a fantasy subgenre that is both targeted at men and almost universally reviled as utter trash outside its specific audience, including by other men).",

Almost every single fantasy novel I've ever read - excluding maybe two - have had similar dymanics and characters. What they don't have is the sex.\n\nI agree with you that a genre for women should be better towards women, but also it's usually women reading *and* writing these books. I'm sure part of it is because those kinds of books sell better but they sell better because people enjoy them. You might not like them, but plenty of people do. It's the same issue that gaming ran into in the 90's when a all women dev team surveyed a lot of women and girls because they figured that the reason the only games made for girls were dress-up games and dating sims was because no one bothered to ask. To their frustration, the results of that survey were that the girls wanted more dress-up games and dating sims.\n\nWhile I might not be a woman anymore, I was for 26 years before I transitioned so I do have some insight on what it's like to be raised as one and I think the lack of dynamics the FMC's have with other women largely comes from it being a romance and the romance being the focus. That being said, a lot of non-romance novels *also* don't typically have women forming meaningful relationships with anyone other than men, and the men in those books are equally shitty.",

Comparing Babel to the Burningblade and Silvereye trilogy to the bladed faith to the lost war and those are all different dynamics and groups. Similar tropes? Sure. But very different group dynamics. I've never seen any romantasy where a woman is friends with more than one woman. If any at all. I've read a few romances and I can confidently say ive seen more examples where bonds between women are highlighted as important. Even while the romance is a focus!  I recently read a romance book with my gf and while the main character had multiple female friends, they felt very stock cardboard cutout.

There are some people saying it, but his books and characterizations don't get *nearly* the hate that booktok novels do.\n\nOverall, a lot of non-romance novels rarely get the same amount of hate that romantasy does. Are there problems with it? Sure, I'm not saying there's not. Are there fantasy novels that do have complex female characters with interesting relationship dynamics between that pass the Bechdel test, but the are just as many that don't.\n\nThere's far more people who hate on the romance genre as a whole whose criticisms boil down to 'there's sex/unhealthy relationships in this and it's not high art' than there are that are actually taking a real feminist reading of the novels.\n\nEdit: ultimately, what I'm saying is, you don't have people making a 4 hour video about why The Shadow of What Was Lost by James Islington is bad in the same frequency that people make a 4 hour video on why Lightlark is bad. Both books are bad, but the criticisms of them are very different.",

What really annoys me are how many of these fantasies and romances largely feature women giving up everything to become the MMC's wife with that being largely the goal. They largely tear down other women and do the same things they bash them for but the story just... backs them up. \n\nSadly, things like protagonist centered morality and \"the protagonist has to whip others into accepting that they need to be the absolute power of life and death\" are common in fantasy but people seem to find some way to justify it when it's more of a higher-stakes adventure.",

At the end of the day it's not anyone's business what anyone else reads. If someone likes reading about a darker version of Peter Pan being possessive and controlling over a Wendy stand-in because it gets their engine going, who am I to judge?",

I don\u2019t think I read many books that are in that category, but that is at least what it feels like to me. Just like twilight for sure got people into reading or back into reading when they were not before. Once someone starts to read, I think that by nature they become more open and liberal because that is what reading does. I would not be surprised if there are hundreds of research studies showing this to be true. The more educated you are the more liberal you\u2019re going to be, so I think saying that someone who reads is going to be more liberal than someone who doesn\u2019t is not a far stretch. I am a leftist but I want everyone to be able to read what they enjoy, even if I never would read a page of the book. It seems so strange to try and gate keep, for lack of a better phrase, reading from conservatives or saying if something contains something that is stereotypically conservative, dominant male etc that it cannot be enjoyed by anyone. A large part of fantasy/reading is that it\u2019s not something that you actually want to or have lived in your real life, but you enjoy reading about it or thinking about it or crazily enough\u2026 fantasizing about it. Keep it up, dear internet stranger, internalized misogyny takes a long time for some to notice and be squashed.",

A fantasy book that's more character-focused and romance heavy might not be your cup of tea, but the people who enjoy those books are actually going out and buying them at independent sellers. And I'm never going to complain about that.\n\n\nI'll be honest, sometimes this romantasy debate starts to sound like adults bitching about the popularity of boy bands.

Now it seems like the Fantasy and Science Fiction sections are 90% books published within the past 5 years that all seem to have the same covers. I've also noticed a trend over the past twenty to thirty years for more and more Fantasy and Science Fiction (especially by newer authors) to be filed as general fiction or literary fiction. If Ursula LeGuin or Sam Delaney were starting out today, they would definitely be filed with general fiction or literary fiction books. \n\nI trust the bookstores stock what sells.

There's tons of fantasy novels being written and in legacy that you can find at bookstores, from Barnes & Noble to your local indy. \n\nSure, they probably aren't the ones that are out on the display shelf - But that is usually not an indicator of what is available, just what is popular. Did anybody who has studied the history of books and publishing will know, romance is always been the most popular. Best? Usually not, very few people remember the romances that were all the rage just 30 years ago.

That's a very small part (timewise) of a longterm relationship.\nI prefer seeing the complex dynamics of pre-established relationships. I think we put falling in love on too high of a pedastal, as opposed to nurturing already established bonds, which also need a lot of care.",
