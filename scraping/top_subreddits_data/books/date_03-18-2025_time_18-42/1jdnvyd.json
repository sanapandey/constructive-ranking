    "selftext": "\u201cFrom trips on private jets and encounters with world leaders to shocking accounts of misogyny and double standards behind the scenes, this searing memoir exposes both the personal and the political fallout when unfettered power and a rotten company culture take hold. In a gripping and often absurd narrative where a few people carelessly hold the world in their hands, this eye-opening memoir reveals what really goes on among the global elite.\u201d -book review\n\nThis. Book. \nSo well written, pointed, thoughtful and detailed. Meta has been filing nonstop against its release due to their having not been given a chance to \u201cfact check\u201d it (crazy how they will so that in relation to themselves but assume no responsibility in the public realm of the meta-sphere). Not typically a nonfiction reader but this one pulled me in and kept me riveted, as an ex corporate mgmt hire, mother and woman in Corporate America during the first two decades of the new millennium, this was both a familiar and uniquely interesting read. \nAvailable for purchase on multiple websites that are not Amazon found at your local bookstore. Bookstore.org has an ereader for an ebook purchase and Libro.fm has the audiobook. \nGet it before its pulled. ",

If you've never had an Audible membership, you can sign up for a free one-month trial, which immediately gives you one credit for a free audiobook (Audible membership is $14-16 per month and you get one audiobook credit per month). Get Sarah Wynn-Williams's book, which kicks off with a killer story about being mauled by a shark as a teenager and nearly dying from botched aftercare as her parents are like, 'stop being so dramatic,' and just make sure to cancel the Audible membership before the free 20-day trial kicks in. A win for Wynn-Williams (counts as a sale) and $0 given to Audible/Amazon.",
