    "selftext": "The book is a Pulitzer prize-winning exploration of the daily struggles of a seriously ill schizophrenic patient who spends the majority of her life in and out of New Yourk City and state hospitals. With an unfailing eye to detail, candor and pragmatism, the author touches on the many ways one person's mental illness can impact how life works within their direct and indirect spheres of influence.\nAll though Sheehan's indepth study of this patient's life takes place, primarily, during the 1970s and 80s, it's timeless as a representation of the perpetual need humans have for the consideration and tangible support of other humans.\n\nThis book has captured my deepest awareness in ways no other book has or ever will. \nIf you also read it, please share your thoughts. \nStellar works of investigative journalism should never be allowed to fade into obscurity when they can still teach us so much.

But IA, this is a fantastic and sad book, but one that humanizes someone who faced a lot of the opposite.",

Were it not for her significantly involved family and the privilege of upper middle class wealth, she would likely ended up committed to an inpatient facility. My stomach dropped when she discussed this in her book. The symptoms of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis are very similar to schizophrenia. The diagnosis didn't exist at the time of the author's experience. She was very, very lucky to get a diagnosis and receive treatment. Her book is incredible and a good reminder of just how fragile our psychophysiological systems can be.\n\n\nIt's morally right to provide dignified care to the mentally ill. For those who struggle with the empathy required to believe that, books like Cahalan's are a good reminder that extreme, devastating mental illness can happen at any time to anyone. What kind of care would you want if it happens to you?",
