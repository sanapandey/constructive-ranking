Yes it\u2019s canon that Vincent went out and bought a cellphone after a little girl was annoyed he didn\u2019t have one and Cloud teased him about \u201cphoning in the verdict.\u201d\n\nSince Dirge was made way before iPhones and smart phones were a thing, it is likely a prepaid flip phone without a plan. Back when I was in high school, these types of phones were still common place. You would actually pay for minutes and load them on to the phone with a minute card.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5xk7vvw5qgpe1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b136c1afe6ff0037a4f82c6ad20c16cc8a80fce",
