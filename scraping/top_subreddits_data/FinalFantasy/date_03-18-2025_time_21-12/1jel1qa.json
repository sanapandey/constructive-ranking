Really it comes down to whether you want turn based/older graphics or action/beautiful modern graphics. I will say though that with 16 some of the quests between big story moments can be a bit of a slog (fetch type quests), whereas 10 the pacing is far more consistent (damn temple trials).\u00a0\n\nOne other thing, XVI is almost all doom and gloom, it has its share of humor in a few of the characters (and item descriptions) but it\u2019s mostly all serious, so if you prefer a story with colorful characters and more lighthearted moments then X is the way to go.",
