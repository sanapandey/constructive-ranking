    "selftext": "**Please use this thread for all discussion of which game you recommend others that you play, whether it is your first game or some that you are considering playing next**\n\nA note for newcomers: most of the games are completely unconnected. Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy II, Final Fantasy V, Final Fantasy IX, etc, are all completely different casts of characters in completely different universes. The only times you need to play another game to understand one is if it is distinctly set in the same universe - for example, Final Fantasy XIII-2 is the sequel to Final Fantasy XIII, or Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII is a prequel to Final Fantasy VII. The titles will usually make it fairly clear which game's universe they are set in\n\nOtherwise, please have fun! It is generally helpful when asking to briefly mention which ones you might be interested in, what platforms you are able to play on, and if you are a complete newcomer, what sort of things in games you're looking for (do you want turn-based combat, real time combat, deep stories with established characters, light stories that let you fill in some blanks with your imagination, etc)",

            "body": "For any newcomers to the franchise, since the different Final Fantasy games aren't connected, you can start wherever you like. However, I would recommend starting with one of these:\n\nFinal Fantasy 4 \u2013 If you want one of the original pixel games. I recommend playing 6 after.\n\nFinal Fantasy 10 \u2013 If you want an old-school 3d turn-based game. You can try 7-9, 12, or 13 after.\n\nFinal Fantasy 14 \u2013 Online MMO, but has a lot of content that can be played solo. Very generous free trial.\n\nFinal Fantasy 16 \u2013 Dark/mature story with fast action combat and huge, epic setpieces/bosses.\n\nFinal Fantasy 7 Remake \u2013 More \"anime\" tone with hybrid combat (mix of realtime action and pausing/menus). I recommend playing its sequel FF7 Rebirth after.",

It also makes it hard to properly see the full personality and relationships of all the characters.\n\nIt'd be like if at the start of X the group split up so you only get to alternate between Wakka and Tidus in one party and then like...

I do wish the side content was more fleshed out, and the story itself wasn't as \"grim-dark\" as the visuals would suggest, but I love that game (and it's thematically/structurally similar to FF4, IMHO - folks seem to miss that.) But I'm the oddball player that loves to mix my tactics and action game play - HUGE fan of Battlezone: Combat Commander for example. FF 16 fits in that cross over space, which may help explain some of the problem people had with it (and the mostly unnecessary cursing/partial nudity that makes it hard to play around kids.)",

But the general themes of FF4, the feeling of the settings and characters, and even the relative lack of side content (it's more linear than expected upon a recent replay) are all pretty similar to 16.\n\nI'd also love to see more content for 16, and maybe a clean up in the end game. They could add a bunch of content all over the map, and maybe another couple of chapters, where you go around and \"solve\" the pink sky problem (some narrative device that cuts off Ultima from that region - maybe something involving the air ship - what a tease!), region by region (so that it sucks less to do the bulk of the late game content in that ugly grim sky condition...)\n\nIt would also be easy to solve the narrative problem with the end - the imperfect vessel stuff. Just add a few more Eikons (or even just 1 more), and call the vessel complete when Clive collects the rest. Adjust the ending accordingly. Now you have a branching ending, fixed. You could still have Clive choose to end the system, but maybe he could do it with his completed powers, along with his friends, and bring the theme to a proper close. (While they are at it, they could replace the final battle's music theme with something more like \"Away\" - that battle theme was lackluster.)\n\nIt would be super easy to fix this game (not that it needs all that much - I really do adore this game, I just didn't love the back half of the ending).",

Rebirth seems more directly inspired by open world-ish games, like Horizon Zero Dawn (some areas even look like HZD), and the Witcher 3 - though it loses the darker feel, at least in the early parts (I'm only up to the second big area after the grasslands). The music for example is MUCH lighter feeling in rebirth, to the point that it lost some of the darker charm of the original game (the same can be said for Remake, just not quite as much). Super fun game though, with a ton of variety and things to do. I'm enjoying the stuffing out of it (on PC, finally.)\n\nI would guess that it would be harder to play Remake after playing Rebirth - the games are fairly different, and Rebirth has a lot more to do. So start with Remake, and maybe try and get through intermission DLC, but it's not necessary (it has a pretty cool boss, but that expansion is kind of hard to stomach - Yuffie's characterization is seriously cringe worthy, especially in the first chapter).",

My no spoilers, light spoilers, hint is that Card, Card Mod, and Enc-None are the best abilities of the early game. \n\nDon't level up in Final Fantasy 8, but instead treat it like Pok\u00e9mon, where you weaken enemies in order to turn them into captures, only this time you turn them into cards which turns them into items which turns them into magic.",

There's a few points where 16's pacing gets very slow and MMO-like. If that doesn't bother you though, then I think the rest of the story is generally great.\n\nGameplay wise, 16 isn't actually open-world (you might be confusing it with 15). It starts very linear, but you'll spend the majority of the game in open zones. Despite that, FF7 Remake has much more of an emphasis on RPG elements (status effects, elemental weaknesses, gear, materia, playable party members, etc.) \n\n16 has fast hack and slash action combat, it is combo-based (sort of like Devil May Cry) and all about creatively stringing together different attacks to do aerial combos and stuff. It has a fairly high ceiling, but the base difficulty is quite easy. FF7 Remake's combat is hybrid combat, combining realtime with command menus and you'd find it to be much closer to the previous FF games.",

Otherwise, the 2013 Steam version with mods would be the better option. Actually, PS1 might be a better one than all of them since the in-battle menu framerate and input detection is tied to the 3D framerate on other platforms with no mods to fix that on either PC release (very noticeable with Squall\u2019s limit break).\n* For X, some PC hardware configurations run into an issue where the cutscenes turn into a solid green screen and others have run into crashing issues. YMMV on that, but the console versions are a safe bet. \n\nCan\u2019t judge IX and XII myself since I haven\u2019t played through them yet, but XII\u2019s PC port has a pretty good reputation.

I've heard about it, I'm familiar with turn based games due to HSR, I'm familiar with combat games aswell.\n\nI care about graphics slightly, I do enjoy pixelated nostalgia games to the likes of Pok\u00e9mon DS games, aswell as modern high render smooth games.\n\nStory is rather important to me, although I tend to skip through dialogue when it gets long and convoluted. I prefer when dialogue is fun and direct and doesn't require you to study the game to understand it aka direct dialogue. \n\nI love gacha and unlocking stuff, especially hidden or secret unlockable weapons, characters, skills, artifacts, etc... I dislike feeling like I'm just completing something as intended and prefer deviating from pure protag characters if possible.\n\nI don't like having to nerd out on something, but I like a doable challenge. Cool bosses are also always a bonus. Cool items to optionally unlock outside of main quest would also be cool. \n\nI hate long loading screens and forced encounters (encounters with npc enemies every 5 steps I take). \n\nI have a low-mid tier laptop which i mainly use for school but can play emulated games or games to the likes of Overwatch on low-medium settings (value of 1000\u20ac), and a nintendo switch to my disposal.\n\nWith this knowledge, what would you guide me to? I want a fun immersing game with an immersive world, great characters, cool villains & cool abilities and unlockables for combat, and a sense of completion. Thoughts?",

I've already played the DS remakes for III and IV, but I have zero knowledge on the other games in the series. I'm also getting the pixel remaster collection on switch, so my questions only apply to VII onwards. (for reference, I'm planning on possibly buying all of them since they're on sale, and I don't want to waste my money on any that might not offer the experience I want.\n\n1. Are there any games that I should steer clear of? From what I've heard, a lot of people dislike XIII, and although I do want to possibly play all of them, I don't want to waste my money if any of these games in particular aren't worth it.\n2. Are the more modern games (from the very little I've looked at them), namely 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 any different from the rest of the series? I've heard something about 11 being an MMO and the other games have too many confusing names and titles for me to tell. Sorry if this question's a bit dumb, but I really only want the core kind of FF experience rather than what seems to be almost another genre entirely.\n3. What's the deal with VII? There are like 3 remakes/sequels/something that all seem to be completely different and it confuses me to no end. Is there just a straight up remaster of the game that I should get that stays true to the original or do i just get the original version?\n4. What's the deal with the *other* remade titles? I know about 3 and 4, but it looks like there's a remaster for 8 and 10 and pretty much everywhere else that I've looked just talks about the game itself rather than if they're worth or not.\n5. Final question. What's X-2? Is it part of the same game or a sequel to X? I've heard by far the most praise for X but I'm not sure if I'm buying something else entirely or if it's good to buy with X like how it is in the steam version that combines the two.\n\nIf you guys have anything to ask, go ahead, but I'd love to make up my mind before the sale ends in 3 days. Thanks!\n\n(also if you can, please actually explain the reasoning behind why i should get a game or not instead of just \"FFXIII bad\" or \"FFVII is peak\" or the like. I'm trying to figure out which ones I'd want, not what others thing is good or not. Thanks a ton!)",

                    "body": "It really depends on what you want.  \nFF 1 - 6 are pixel, turn based. If you like a good story, I'd play 4 or 6. 1, 3 and 5 have job systems and meh story. FF 2 is a bit of an oddball.  \nFF 7 - 10 (and 10-2) are turn based. 10 is probably the easiest to get into with voice acting and HD remaster. All are good in their own right, 7 is usually considered the best in the series though a ton of people love 9 and 10. If you can play on PC there are plenty of mods for FF7 to help enhance the visuals. 8 and 10-2 are the oddballs but I love both of them. They're all worth a play.  \nFF 12 is where the series moves from turn based. I wasn't a huge fan of the story (it's basically star wars) but the gameplay is fun. Very fantasy like setting.  \nFF 13 trilogy is very divisive and introduces the stagger system the series uses today. I haven't played in 10+ years but it's very narrative heavy and 13 is fairly linear. 13-2 is less linear, 98% same battle system from 13 (but better) and narratively messy. 13-3 Lightning Returns is a mess altogether but has some interesting battle schemes. I like the trilogy but I can see why a lot of the fandom does not  \nFF 15 is divisive as well. At release it was pretty unfinished but subsequent patches have made it better. Gameplay is fun and story isn't too bad. A lot of media to get into if you enjoy the story but it is not needed to play the game. I never explored the other media.  \nFF 16 is an action game through and through. The story is fairly heavy and depressing. The story isn't bad but I wouldn't consider it an RPG. The boss battles are pretty epic though.\n\nFF 7 has a ton of side games, novels, anime, movies etc. It's by far the most popular FF and probably the most popular/ influential JRPG of all time. There is a remaster/port of the original on xbox, playstation, switch, PC. I'd recommend playing first before the remake trilogy but you can jump into the remake trilogy, you will just have way more questions than answers. Hell, people who played the OG have more questions than answers so take that as you will. Remake (Part 1) and Rebirth (Part 2) are very well done and probably the best Final Fantasy released since X2 (MY OPINION.) Part 3 has just started development so we are years off from the completion.\n\nThere are remakes and remasters. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 , 9 , 10, 10-2, and 12 have remasters. These may have additional content or faithful to the original but are designed to be played on modern hardware.\n\n3 and 4 have additional remakes (new graphics, engines, voice acting, story beats.) Again, a definitive version is debatable. If you want something more modern play the remakes, if you want the original experience play the pixel remasters. Though for FF 4 I'm partial to the PSP only FF4 complete collection.\n\nX2 is a direct sequel to X. It's very divisive as well but the one thing everyone can agree on is the battle system is excellent. I love X2, personally. One of my favorites. Playing right after finishing X can be jarring for sure.",

Although I don\u2019t particularly love Tidus, I do love Yuna, but I can\u2019t exactly put my finger on why I\u2019m not loving 10 to quite the same degree as 6.

Other than that one thing, the gameplay and the story is fantastic and I don\u2019t care at all that it is such a \u201clinear\u201d experience. \n\nWith all the being said, which FF game would you recommend to me next out of 7, 8, 9, 10-2, and 12 (TZA)?

For 4 I recommend the PSP remaster or the 3D remake. 6 just go with the Pixel Remaster.\n\n9 is the best of the PS1 era. Any version will do. \n\n12 is the best of the PS2 era. The Zodiac Age Remaster is ideal here.\n\nModern FF era i\u2019d recommend just starting with 16, but 13 and 15 are both good choices though 13 plays quite differently. \n\n(I am a 13 defender and will be til I die.

Mostly to fish.\n\u2022 Royal Pack: There are datalogs/documents scattered across the map now for added lore and whatnot.\n\u2022 Royal Pack: A secret/optional super boss fight against a classic Final Fantasy super boss.\n\u2022 Free/Update: You can switch party members in battle now. You have to unlock it in the Ascension grid, but it\u2019s super cheap.\n\u2022 Free/Update: The Ring of Lucil is much more powerful, so it actually lives up to the hype.\n\u2022 Free/Update: There are three side quest chains. One\u2019s a Terra Battle crossover that is fun (Noctis and Sarah have a lot of chemistry), one\u2019s a Final Fantasy XIV crossover (it\u2019s great and gets you a new summon), and one has a little story to it and a Lv99 boss.\n\u2022 Free/Update: Level cap is now 120. There\u2019s also an accessory to allows you to not level up when resting.\nGreat for a Lv1 playthrough.\n\u2022 Magitek Exosuits. Basically, suits that make you invincible for a period of time, but they take 20 real-life hours to recharge. Doesn\u2019t work on the super boss mentioned above or the final boss of the FFXIV crossover.\n\u2022 Free/Update: Timed Quests are a thing. There\u2019s a daily quest that you can complete to get points to spend on items and whatnot.\nOverall, it\u2019s quite a bit.

I much prefer the strategy that goes into planning out turns and actions rather than \"press all the buttons!\", and FF7R seems to be more of the latter than the former compared to the original.\n\nOne of my cousins has the game and he tried to explain there's a setting to make it more like the original, but I didn't understand the way he explained it. \n\nSo maybe someone here can do a better job: can you make FF7R play more like the original? It doesn't have to be a stand-still and wait until your ATB gauge fills like OG7, but I don't want to have to try to fight with menu commands while dodging attacks and trying to button mash autos to interrupt enemies like I've been seeing in some livestreams of it.",

(The game won't tell you when, but when a character leaves the party, that's usually is the time)  \nEpisode DLCs have spoilers in the end credits so skip credits for now.  \nI played the DLCs as they happened and I had a great time.

I don't know how to put it exactly but I've seen many comments in this sub talking about how they started with XX popular FF game, they didn't like it, but then they played another one and began to absolutely adore the franchise and I think I share the sentiment. I've yet to find that FF game that just \"clicks\" on me, but I don't know which one it could be! so I figured I could ask in here. Here are some things about myself, if that helps:\n\n\\- Persona and Fire Emblem are among the first JRPG franchises I've ever played and I'm still a HUGE fan of them. Persona 4 Golden and Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn are my favorite games from those two.\n\n\\- I've barely played any MMOs in my life but Dragon Quest X is one of my favorite DQs.\n\n\\- Final Fantasy III is the most fun I've had with a JRPG in YEARS.\n\n\\- IX and XVI are the FFs that caught my eye the most. I really dig IXs overall style and XVI looks really cool (or maybe I'm just infatuated by Clive lol).\n\n\\- As for games that I played recently that I liked... NEO: TWEWY and Romancing Saga: Minstrel Song were pretty dang awesome.\n\n\\- I can't play anything that came on the PS5, both because I don't have the console and because my Pc ain't that strong.\n\n\\- As for what I want in a game, I'd like it to be fun and to have endearing characters over anything else. Good world building and character development is very welcome too.",

The original FF1 on NES was a huge slog, since you got limited gil, everything was expensive, enemies can kill you fast, and it felt like it took forever to level. It will cut the playing time pretty significantly (I beat each of them in 10-12 hours) but you'll be actually playing the game instead of spending 30 hours grinding\n\nFor the SNES era, I absolutely love 6. The story and characters are great, the combat is fun (you get a lot of character variety), the music is great, and it has some of the most iconic scenes of any Final Fantasy game. 4 is also fun, but IMO the plot isn't as strong as 6's and you end up having a very squishy party for the first ~half of the game. (The story is fun though, and there's some iconic scenes)\n\nIf you like JRPGs with an Action Time Battle system I'd say play 7 or 9. 7 if you like more of a sci-fi setting and 9 if you like more fantasy.\n\nIf you like MMOs and automation, but want to play a single player game, FF12 is great (specifically the Zodiac version). Vaan is one of my least favorite protagonists in the franchise, but Balthier is probably my single favorite character, and the story and music are fantastic (plus its in Ivalice which is a cool world IMO)\n\nFinal Fantasy X is a great intro to the series as well, as it offers turn based battle (so you can take your time), the characters are well designed, the story is good, and the music is great. It also offers a ton of opportunity to grind to become godly at the game to the point where you beat the last boss in 1 hit. Blitzball is also one of my favorite side games in the series, even though it does seem to be kind of polarizing\n\nIf you like a more modern setting and like to break RPGs so hard that you can basically become a god in the game before you even really start it, FF8 is great. The Junction system is a huge difference, and it can be confusing at first (at least it was for me as a kid when it first came out). Basically you draw magic from enemies, then equip that magic to stats. You can also play Triple Triad (a card game, my favorite minigame in the franchise) to get monster cards which you can turn into powerful magic....so basically you can get end game spells if you focus on playing cards at the start of the game. Another noticeable difference is that FF8 has scaled enemies, and the enemies actually scale stronger than you do, so you're pretty heavily incentivized to not level up *at all* while getting stronger spells to junction.\n\nIf you want an open world RPG, FFXV is fun but does feel a little rushed or unfinished. You can easily get sucked into doing dozens of sidequests rather than progressing the story. The combat is alright (kinda felt like Assassins Creed where you hold dodge/block all the time then attack when there's an opening), but the music, graphics, story, and scripted events are all fantastic.\n\nI haven't played V and didn't really care for XIII or XVI so I don't really have notes on those. XIII has cool character designs and great music, but there were a lot of contrived plot points and I didn't really like the characters themselves. You also auto-battle pretty much the entire game which wasn't very appealing to me (but maybe I need to try it again).\n\nI also don't really care for MMOs, but I will say FFXIV was surprisingly fun",

            "body": "I would like to grab a new FF game during the steam sale. I'm not very well versed in the series. I played FF1 as a kid and I played FFX and LOVED it and FFXIV for a few months or so. I was also incredibly addicted to FF tactics/advance (not sure if those count)\n\nI absolutely LOVED FFX but I'm ready to try something new. After looking through the ones that seem interesting to me, I'm torn between FFX11 the zodiac age OR FFXV. Can anyone offer some insight into those installments and which one I might be more likely to enjoy?\n\nHere's what I loved about the FF games I've played:\n\n* the characters, story, aesthetic of FFX\n* the dramatic and huge summons in FFX - it was such a cool aspect of the white mage and created a lot of happy gaming moments i.e. the fierceness of Shiva's snap\n* the sphere grid in X was great, but the job system in tactics was really top-tier for me\n* I love that you had some kind of build freedom with character builds but they maintained their specific role and niche within the party - that combination of freedom but staying within the confines of a class I thought was really brilliant\n* open world elements and plenty of side quests/missions other things to do than the main storyline are always appreciated\n* I did love the turn based combat and am really nervous to try the more real-time iterations of combat systems. But I am open to try!\n\nSorry I know that was a lot. So... which do you think would be a better fit for me? XII zodiac age or XV?  \nOr is there another iteration of the series that would be even MORE up my alley that I might have missed?\n\nAll help appreciated!",

                    "body": "I would say 12 is more of your classic Final Fantasy, it hits everything you're pointing out and is a wonderful game outright.\nI do personally love 15 a lot, but it definitely has its flaws in the backend of the story and with the fairly simple combat (which I actually liked, but I think that's a less common point of view). But my favourite things about 15 are the music and just the vibes... It's hard to explain, but there's a certain feel to the game which I adore. \nIn the end, play both is my recommendation, but I'd say 12 first then 15",
