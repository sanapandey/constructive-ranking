I have the money but really shouldn\u2019t be spending it since im saving uo for an exchange but its such a great deal tho. What do you think?",

Unless they can take a higher resolution picture to prove otherwise.\n\nEDIT: I am convinced it's the Chinese release due to the cover and the barcode at the back. The Japanese version didn't have a barcode due to being bundled with the vita in most cases. \n\n[Chinese version.](https://www.jnlgame.com/products/final-fantasy-x-2-hd-remaster-chinese-sub-psv-playstation-vita-japanese-import)\n\n[Japanese version](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/372663311298?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=DyTt2J_uTCi&sssrc=4429486&ssuid=qihmjwfbrsg&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY)\n\n[Full Bundle](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/s/Trg0YRq23U)",
