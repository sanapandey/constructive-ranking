    "selftext": "Settle a debate in my local friend group. If we were to classify Clive from FF16 in a traditional \u201cJob\u201d or \u201cClass\u201d (while other debate going on), what would he be? I think he\u2019s closest to Blue Mage, as he pulls magic and Eikons from his enemies to gain strength. One friend says he\u2019s a Red Mage, since he uses melee based combat mixed with black magic, and my other friend insists he\u2019s just a Black Mage with a sword. \n\nWhat do yall think? ",
