Then I ended up appreciating both Crisis Core and XV more than I thought I would.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely flawed but it\u2019s a solid open world map and the guys are all pretty good characters. The biggest issue is the story was too big so it\u2019s a bit weak in game and then that also leaves so many good NPC characters too uninvolved beyond Noct and the crew. I absolutely loved Aranea Highwind for one.",

We love them so much we're offended when things aren't exactly what we expected. But ultimately ALL the games are great, even the awful MMOs.

Within the last couple years they finally became available on the Xbox store, but I don't think they're available on the original versions of the last Gen. So your 3 options are really just steam, Xbox store, or grabbing a 15 year old physical copy...which I think was an Xbox exclusive if I remember correctly?\n\nLong answer short, Xbox store. If you can find a physical copy then that'll work too I suppose. I know FF13: Lightning Returns ran backwards compatible that way.",
