    "selftext": "Hi there, I saw FF 6, 7, 9 and 10 in discount, I already played them (some in ps2 and some are cracked games, Latin American moment) but this time I would like to buy some.\n\nMy question is, this are the best discounts on FF steam or there where better discounts before? I say this because the 6 is just 30% but some are 60%**,** and if there were better discounts I'd wait for another moment. Does any one with good memory can tell me pls? Thanks in advanced \n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4bedijpcipe1.png?width=1710&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fa0a6c5cbdbf18acab3b4b088aeb43d4cd41162\n\n",
