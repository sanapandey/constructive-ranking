Met him at a con once and he was beyond kind, too.\n\nLoved him as Balthier but went total fangirl for him when he played Fenris from Dragon Age.

He *is* talking down to everyone, and his plan is hilariously dumb, but he's also supposed to be earnest and compassionate.  Riegel should have nailed that, but I don't think the director gave him the right direction.\n\nI do miss Taliesin, he had a great voice for Thancred, but Peter Bramhil has grown on me since Shadowbringers.",
