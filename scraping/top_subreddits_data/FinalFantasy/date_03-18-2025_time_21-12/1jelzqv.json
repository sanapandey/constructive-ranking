I'm not too worried about story but I want one that's available on a modded ps vita(can be psp game too) that's preferably 3d bc I really enjoy the look of dissidia and crisis core and I was wondering if there were any that have that similar vibe. thanks for your help!",

Hunt down the fan translation, pop it in, and enjoy. It's an Action JRPG made by a lot of the same team as Crisis Core, with a new world and cast. 14, to be specific. One of my favorites, even if it's a bit jank.",
