    "selftext": "Going into this post, I know it is an unpopular opinion but the game is almost 16 years old now. Old enough to drink in Germany. \n\nSo, I was there for it from the start.\nA friend of mine, a massive FF fan, and I pooled our money and got FF13 on release.\nI have played FF7, FF3, FF4 and FF8 at this point and he has played them all.\n\nI was the second one to get a turn to play it and when my friend gave the 360 discs to me something must have been scratched or something but the game always crashed during the first mech fight of the game during the opening.\n\nThus I gave up on it and never played it until the release of the steam deck on which it ran badly on its release.\n\nNow though it runs like a dream, better than on windows ironically, and I\u2019ve been *finally* playing it. Or was as I just finished it.\nI was going in with knowledge of the entire series, having played them all aside of 11 and 14.\n\nAnd I kinda feel that -similarly to Dead Space 3 and Mass Effect 3- a lot of the hate is forced. People excessively hate on it because it\u2019s the popular opinion but many never having played it through.\n\nIt *isn't* the best FF but it doesn\u2019t need to be.\n\nThe gameplay might be my favorite version of turn based combat in the entire series. The paradigm system makes it so that you have to constantly switch reacting to the situation. \nIt makes it so that it feels in-the-moment something that I never felt in any of the preceding combat and only true action combat could match in subsequent titles.\nThe enemies hit hard and often and they sometimes have way to much HP but it never felt unfair.\n\nThe Music was heartfelt and especially the Ragnarok track never left my ears during gameplay.\n\nThe graphics, while obviously dated nowadays, still felt somewhat contemporary. It truely looked mind boggling at release and owing to some seriously clever techniques they were able to fake some graphic techniques that weren\u2019t quite there back then.\nThe use of extremely highly detailed 2D Sprites in some areas with incredibly painted on shadows sells the illusion that its lighting and smaller props actually were objects and real time lighting.\nCase in point being the crystal sea at the beginning.  Seriously, go take a look. It looks much better than it had any need to on the fucking 360/PS3.\n\nThis was in part possible due to its very linear nature and this is my biggest and possibly only real complaint.\nIt\u2019s opening chapters are literally on rails.\nWhile it helps to sell the feeling of a one woman crusade in Lightnings levels and being chased around by the army in Sazhs sections it limited the exploration to a degree I didn\u2019t like that much.\n\nThat said, the aforementioned one woman crusade moments were great. Running down the streets of Eden penetrating both Pulse forces as well as Sanctum troops harkened back to FF7 general mood in its closing chapters.\n\nIts visual design was maybe the only FF title were every design matched its world. No character outfit was weirdly unusual. They all looked liked people of this world. The buildings felt in line with other areas of cocoon and the weapons didn\u2019t feel out of place either.\n\nFF8 and 15 were especially bad in this regard. The gardens looked so out of place in a contemporary designed world, the characters clothes looked so different from random NPCs. The latter being something  that I think plaques all FF titles besides 6, 7 (and its Remakes) and 16.\n\nI think the ending was earned. The massive struggle the characters felt over these few days prepared them to face this challenge and they grew into their role in this play nicely. Especially Vanille, Lightning and Hope had great character arcs.\nLightning being obviously inspired by Clouds journey, Vanille learning that Fangs world view wasn\u2019t the end all be all and that she herself is a person with flaws just like any other and Hope learning that there is more to live than despair and fatalism.\n\nI could talk for hours about what I just experienced.\n\nBut to most accurately describe the game I would say it was the culmination of Squares attempt on making a block buster movie game on the level of Hollywood movies they tried to achieve since at least FF7 and arguably FF6 going by its opera-like presentation.\n\nIt truly felt like a movie. Like what Spirits within should have been and I think it\u2019s a good final fantasy title. A good variation in a series that is build reinventing itself. I would not want it to be repeated but I wouldn\u2019t mind a Remake that breaths more live into this epic story. \n\nAs unlikely as that is.\n\nAs a final note, I am now convinced that a certain revelation in FF15, originally part of the FF13 project, was and is a remnant of the Death God Fal'Cie tricking the main characters into ensuring their vision being realized. \nThey just swapped the Fal'Cie for more generic FF deities.",

                                    "body": "I'll try to abridge a long story so here we go; \n\nI grew up playing Kingdom Hearts and for years my brothers and I tried getting into the Final Fantasy series. When XIII was announced, it immediately became my number 1 most anticipated game ever. I practically followed this game like a hawk, devouring any scrap of info that dropped. When it released in 2009 in Japan and magazines that covered overseas games were wrote about how highly and well recieved the game was, getting universal praise from almost every Japanese publication. Easy to say, I was stoked.\n\nAll of this preamble is to show that I didn't go into this game wanting to hate it. I was superbly hyped. Come the 2010 release I managed to save up some money and I bought it day 1. The best way that I can explain my reaction to the game was hoe many people felt about The Phantom Menace. I was tricking myself into liking the game. \n\nTo give some positives, the game is absolutely gorgeous. Probably one of the best looking games of all time, and age hasn't diluted it. The combat had some neat ideas, just not well executed... and... the story on paper sounds interesting. \n\nNow for what I dont like. Well, pretty much everything else. I hated the gameplay and how automatic it felt. At one point I remember going through multiple battles, boss fights included, where auto battle practically carried me. It was such a crutch I forced myself not to use it. People complain about XVI being easy, XIII could be completed by even a baby, it's that braindead. The linear design of locations also got on my nerves as I always felt I was being forced into a single path both in terms of story progression and character progression. The freaking level up system was so boring. But none of these problems were as frustrating or as annoying as the characters themselves. The cast of XIII is easily my most hated cast of characters in any rpg. I consider them worse than the cast of VIII and those were the most white bread boring individuals ever concieved. The writing is so bad and obnoxious, and when im hating the characters and story, then why should I bother continuing to play. But play I did. \n\nI finished the game drained of any hype or want, but I finished it and right then and there, I swore of the Final Fantasy series. XIII was so bad, so boring, so draining that I practically wanted nothing to do with the rest of the series. I assumed the series was more of this crap and convinced myself that the people giving it positive reviews were just crazy and fooling themselves. \n\nI would have to make a post itself to really get into why I hate XIII and why its easily my worst game in the entire Final Fantasy franchise. \n\nSo instead;\n\nTL;DR \n\nBoring combat that requires no input from the player. \n\nAuto Battle is the worst thing ever\n\nBeing unable to command allies in combat, removing any form of tactics or creativity \n\nHorrible storytelling filled with the worst cast characters I've ever had the displeasure of being forced to play as\n\nLinear progression on multiple facets makes the game a chore to play.",

                                            "body": "Long post but I played the trilogy recently and I'm really passionate about it, so lemme explain why I love it.\n\n\nI'm kinda surprised to hear you call FF13 brain dead. I played it recently and my experience couldn't be more oppposite. Lots of REGULAR enemies forced me to rethink my paradigms after losing and give them another try, and there were a few times I got walled. Most FF games i've played, like FF15, FF9 and FF7, are pretty mindless by comparison, where the game never **pushes** you. Just be decently high level and have good moves, or in FF15's case spam potions.\n\n\nFF13 meanwhile is one of few games where buffs and debuffs are VITAL, even in regular battles. All the while the ATB system is more aggressive with you no longer needing to wait for it to fill to act or give commands to your party (you can even instantly fill your entire ATB gauge by switching paradigms after waiting 12 seconds), and the stagger system meant you needed to juggle filling and maintaining stagger while also switching to paradigms to heal or guard attacks and debuff/buff. The game is **stressful.** I also like that you need to decide your paradigms BEFORE battle- it forces you to **come up with a plan.** The rating system and time tracking also encourages you to be efficient.\n\n\nI mean, I guess I have heard of people struggling with the game beating it. I'm reminded of seeing a post where someone casually mention Barthandalus 2 is a hard fight because he has a \"gimmick where he casts Doom.\" The problem there being that nearly every boss casts Doom if you wait 20 minutes, as it's meant to punish you for playing badly. That person beat the game but that kinda displayed to me they probably weren't very good at the game- which is fair, it's a hard game and requires a lot of strategy.\n\n\nI wish I had clips of myself playing the game, but I don't sadly. HOWEVER, I do have some clips of me playing Lightning Returns, which while it has a different combat system, is appealing to me for similar reasons- largely that a lot of the game is hard unless you prepare a strategy first, and execute it well within its time based mechanics. Here's me doing a boss for example. Aside from the usual buffs and debuffs, I have to spread my moves among 3 ATB meters so that I don't run out of one too quickly. I cast Element in one \"paradigm\" because it fills the ATB of other paradigms, and by mashing guard to run out of ATB within that paradigm, it automatically casts an attack buff on me. All of this while building and maintaining stagger so I can go in for the kill. There's no auto battle but this doesn't feel any different from how I would play FF13.    \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ncRmUdSuaA\n\n\nThe reason auto battle works in FF13 is because the paradigm system exists. If you're a ravager and the boss you're fighting is weak to thunder, you're GOING to spam thunder- so auto battler is going to do the same. By **going into** Ravager, you have already chose to spam thunder. Auto battle will only do what you want it to do, and the same goes for your automated party members. The automation doesn't take away your agency, it just cuts out the menuing for the sake of saving you time because it's supposed to be fast paced and every second matters.\n\n\nAnyways, I think the story is good too. They start out as bad people, but I think a lot of their behavior is justified. Despite this, as you progress throughout the game, they grow as people- not on their own, but by **lifting eachother up.** Lightning is punching Snow at the beginning of the game, yet by the end of it she's calling him her brother, and TELLING him to act like a hero, to stay positive. Meanwhile, Snow comes across as a good hearted airhead early on, whose \"hero\" act is a facade he's failing to keep up, but it inspires Lightning to chin up in the end and he learns to keep staying positive for everyone's sake.\n\n\nThis is what makes FF13's story good to me- It's not about gods and crystals, or some messed up society. It's about a group of jerks learning to get along.\n\n\nLike- did you notice this is one of few FF games to introduce nearly every party member at once? The point of this was to get them all together and show off how dysfunctional they are. Then they all disband because they can't get along. Yet when they DO unite, what happens? **You're all fighting Barthandalus together, and the game unlocks full party control.** People often complain that you don't get all party members and party control until the end of the game, but I just LOVE how symbolic it is of the fact that **you're all acting as one, single, unstoppable L'Cie now.** This is also JUST before you're dropped in the middle of Pulse too- it's like once everyone started getting along and moving past their flaws, they realized how well they all work together, and their worlds expanded.\n\n\nI also think the linearity is a benefit. You're limited by your Chrystarium level forced on you in whatever chapter you're in, but this also means the developers **know how strong you'll be** during every boss, which allows things to be more fine tuned. You can't overpower bosses with grinding. It's also easy to digest, and allows things like the environments to be framed in more beautiful ways.    \nThough if you don't like its linearity, FF13-2 fixes it a bit, and Lightning Returns is just an open world game entirely.",

I'd been following it since its announcement at E3 2006, and it looked absolutely incredible. I remember many saying that, even with the power of the PS3 at its peak, it was impossible for the game to look as good as it did in those early trailers. But Square Enix quickly shut those mouths with subsequent presentations, which maintained that impressive visual level and made us believe we were witnessing the next big milestone for the franchise.\n\nBut then the long-awaited launch day arrived\u2026 and as I said. Many of us tried to fool ourselves for a while, seeking to justify the unjustifiable or convincing ourselves that maybe we were overlooking something. But in the end, we had to accept the truth: Final Fantasy XIII simply didn't live up to expectations. And the worst part is, when you investigate the game's development, you understand why everything went so wrong.\n\nThe director had the ambition to create a new kind of RPG, one in which customization and strategic decisions were sacrificed in favor of a more narrative-driven and cinematic experience. But therein lies the game's greatest flaw: its story and its characters. If you're going to build a narrative-driven RPG, then you need a solid story and characters that connect emotionally with the player... and Final Fantasy XIII fails miserably in both areas. The plot is unnecessarily convoluted, riddled with terms and concepts that seem created solely to confuse, and the characters rarely manage to convey anything genuine or memorable.\n\nI don't know if the sequels managed to fix some of the inconsistencies and narrative flaws of the original. The truth is, Final Fantasy XIII left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I never had the interest or the will to give it another chance. It's a shame, because the potential was there... but its disastrous execution turned it into one of the franchise's biggest disappointments.",

Soundtrack was exceptional as well.\n\nI did not vibe with the story or characters. I liked Sazh and Vanille, but the other characters didn't land for me for various reasons. I also felt the story kept shooting itself in the foot.\n\nThe linearity and lack of interactability in the world was stifling and hurt the game. The world doesn't feel like a well realized place I'm journeying through, it feels like I'm moving from set piece to set piece.\n\nThe linearity even extends to the upgrade system with the crystarium being one of the most boring leveling mechanics in the entire series.\n\nAnd before I'm called a hater, I was super excited for the game and really wanted to like it, but I didn't. I still gave the rest of the trilogy a shot and really liked XIII-2 as I felt that it fixed almost every issue I had with the first game and I found the characters more likeable.\n\nEdit: already getting downvoted, classic",

By restricting party members and paradigms, it makes you play in different ways. And the game is challenging, which forces you to learn each paradigm/party combination. I do agree that it's too **slow** about doing all of this- I mean, you don't even get paradigms until over an hour in- but I like the combat even when it's limited.\n\n\nI love the story for its themes of optimism and hope, and I like the found family angle the story takes, how everyone starts out flawed and dysfunctional but help eachother overcome their flaws.\n\n\nI agree about the world thing though. I love its world, but REALLY wish I got more of it. Which is a **good** thing in a way- but yeah there's lost potential in getting to feel part of it lol.\n\n\nI like the leveling system though. Yeah it's limited, but this also allows for a more curated experience- the devs always know what tools and what stats you'll have at each point of the game. Honestly not enough games do this. I think you still get a feeling of party building through setting up paradigms and accessories anyways.\n\n\nAnd I think 13-2 does some things better, buuuuuut it was also far easier than 13, so I felt like I got less out of it lol. The QOL changes were nice, and I appreciate it's a bit more open gameplay-wise, but still, FF13 was **tense**, while 13-2 I got through 75% of the game spamming Ruinga mindlessly. And Serah and Noel are likeable, but I like that 13 had a bigger and more diverse cast. Not crazy about how it retcons 13's ending either, but the story is good.    \nI also feel they didn't reaaaaally fix the hallway problem? It has more maze-like design in its areas but... I think that still feels too confined and can actually be more **annoying** lol.\n\n\nLightning Returns I think has amazing combat and in a lot of ways feels more like 13 did, and improves on the hallway thing FAR more by being open world.",

I can't point to anything actually wrong with it, I just find it entirely forgettable.\n\nI don't like the characters. They're one note, and you don't get any sense that they're fully rounded people. They're defined by one key flaw and a superficial description.\n\nFor instance: Lightning is a soldier, and she loves her sister. Her key flaw is that she's temperamental and doesn't listen to other people. But what else? We don't really know anything about who Lightning is or what she does. And this related to the next problem.\n\nThis game has the absolute worst world building I've ever seen in a video game. The furthest I've gotten in this game is about 30 hours in, well past the point where the party comes together and the combat opens us. And I still could not tell you anything about what living in Cocoon is like. Because the game never really shows how it works.\n\nNo, instead, the world building is shoved into the datalog. What life is like in Cocoon, how its government works, how the world's cosmology works, et al. is just left in what is effectively an in-game wiki. And I will not do the game's work for it. It is not my job to do research to understand why I should give a damn about the world.\n\nAnd even if the world building wasn't so poor, the story is awful, too.\n\nThe first half of the story is literally the party picking random directions and wandering aimlessly while repeating the same thing to each other for *10 to 15 hours* of game time. The second half of the story has the bad guy telling the party what to do, and the party saying that they won't help him while doing everything he told them to do. I legitimately wonder if the game was made on a first draft of the script.\n\nThen we get to the gameplay. I'm going not spend my time writing out a long explanation of the many problems with the game's structure because [this video](https://youtu.be/QMZMJDFe1kc?si=aqTGAwPJtLJjYVAQ) does a much better job of it than I can.\n\nFor the combat, I'm still not a fan. The game's fans really oversell the combat's depth. To get through virtually the entire game, you need three Paradigms: buff/debuff, defensive/healing, and attacking. Open each fight with buffs/debuffs, switch to attack when buffs and debuffs are set, switch to heal as needed.\n\nWill this get you through 100% of all fights? I'll grant that I don't know how well it will work against optional superbosses, and there may be the occasional gimmick enemy that it doesn't apply to but that's not what I'm talking about. This will get you through virtually the entire main story.\n\nAnd that's not even mentioning that it's game over when the party leader goes down or how the characters will make no effort to avoid AOE attacks while you're forced to watch with zero control of where they stand.\n\nBut, I will also grant that liking and disliking combat is a matter of taste, like the soundtrack. I'm not particularly interested in arguing back and forth about it.\n\nThe game also does not respect the player's time. After the party is branded as l'Cie, the game then spins it's wheels for literally a quarter of its run time, and the combat holds your hand and doesn't let you actually play it as intended for the first 20 to 25 hours, or, literally half of the game.\n\nAnd that about covers the basics.",

This isn't me hating your perspective, just explaining my own in hopes it gives someone a different angle to view things from. I also don't disagree with everything you said, just some of it. Anyways...\n\n\nI think the world building thing is fair, but many people would describe FF13's story as a soap opera, focusing on its characters, more than the world or conflict. And what's there is solid.\n\n\nI don't think you need to know everything about a character to say they're well written or interesting either. Most games don't, especially FF games. Like, how much can you say about Cloud in the original FF7 that isn't related to his flaws and how he comes out of his shell in the story, and his trauma? So I don't really see why FF13 focusing on character flaws makes them \"one-note.\" In fact, focusing on their flaws is the opposite of one-note.\n\n\n\"To get through virtually the entire game, you need three Paradigms: buff/debuff, defensive/healing, and attacking. Open each fight with buffs/debuffs, switch to attack when buffs and debuffs are set, switch to heal as needed.\"    \nI mean, first off, this is every RPG. Buffs, debuffs, healing when needed, and attacking, are just what make up RPG combat. Heck, Final Fantasy games usually don't even get any mileage out of buffs and debuffs, so FF13 is doing more than that. But you're also leaving out some things. Often it's effective to switch to Sentinel when you're about to get hit, which guards attacks, almost like a makeshift block button. (This is likely why Lightning Returns actually introduced a block button when it redid the combat system, as FF13-2 pushes the idea that switching to Sentinel is akin to a guard.) If you switch paradigm after 12 seconds, you also instantly fill your ATB. Some enemies take stagger differently too, which means using the same paradigms aren't always going to work. Some enemies are better dealt with using crowd control attacks too, and other enemies are better killed with launch and smites, such as Behemoths. Not to mention, debuffs and buffs don't last forever, so you have to balance ALL of this **with** doing that, AND healing when you need to. Which is all very fast paced and often pretty tight to execute. It forces you to constantly be thinking on your feet, on top of going into battles with reworked paradigms and a strategy in mind for a lot of situations.\n\n\nI also think each chapter leading up to the combat opening up is like its own challenge where you're given specific party members that need to be used in different ways. Like, the way you fight enemies with Lightning and Fang is going to be different from how you fight enemies with Sazh and Vanille, and at some point it starts to give you 3 party members, which allows you to think of even more. You're limited in what paradigms and moves are available early on too- So every single chapter has to be played differently.",

Your levels are capped, equipment limited, npc and sidequests very sparse, exploration almost nonexistent etc. Its not really much worse than ffx in linearity but it ends up feeling much more so because the player doesnt get to personally make much impact on the game until much later.\n\nIts got amazing beats for a story with big cinematics and great set ups. That form up an overall fairly mediocre story with a bad overarching villain.\n\nIts combat has lots of fun things to it and you can do some interesting builds. But you are incredibly limited for a long time and once you finally get larger freedom you are met with truly insane grinds.\n\nThe music is great and emotional at times competing with 8 for enotionally evocative tracks meshing well with gameplay. Other times though you have tracks that just feel so completly out of place.\n\nOveral i enjoyed it but have no desire to ever replay it like most of the titles (1-3,7 and all associated properties aside from the original crisis core,9, 10 postgame.)\n\nI do highly enjoy FF13-2 though as fighting bosses with your own gigantaur towering over them or the omega weapon blasting them out of existance is just super entertaining. And added some much needed depth to the originals rather simple system.\n\n While somehow the random time travel mess makes a more cohesive compelling main story.",

Rather, its roles exist to boil down the few options players would take in an RPG at any moment. For example, if you're low on health and want to heal yourself, you're going to use Cure on yourself, right? The devs recognized this, so they made the Medic paradigm. Now you're just switching to the medic paradigm to heal yourself. It's the same result- you're doing the exact same things, and you need to have the \\*intent\\* to do these things for them to happen. The only thing being automated is the menuing.\n\nAnd that's because the paradigm system exists to save the player time in a battle system where every second matters. It's ATB on drugs, where you're CONSTANTLY making decisions. Honestly, despite the \"automation\", you're pushed to \\*think\\* more than you do in most FF games, at a faster rate.",

But there are actually a couple ways you can manipulate the atb for some more dynamic combat. For example, using triangle to cut your atb short and use just the abilities that have already charged. Timing these can let you keep launched enemies in the air for pretty much the whole fight, interrupt certain enemy actions, or combine things like Scourge and Smite with your party members. You can execute, and then right away cancel Attacks to evade enemy abilities too, like with Lightning's backflip upon \"finishing\" her attack chain (you just cancel it before she uses a single one). Switch in a sentinel, use a single guard and instant paradigm shift to provide a brief defense boost to the party. Just little things to make what people think is a boring system into a more interactive one.",

The combat system doesn't punish you for not learning these intricacies but rewards you for learning it properly. I think that's pretty cool.\n\nTo be fair, 10 has some cool mechanical with its turn based and certain actions taking less time in terms of the turn based charge. 12 has things like using shock over flare as it has a quicker cooldown (though this seems like flare is just underpowered), and things like reflect spamming as a quick but risky strategy. 7 has cool materia combos...\n\nBut these are all niche applications of combat systems that aren't taught, but are embedded in ways that feels deliberate.

That was me, i was absolutely disgruntled about ff13 - i picked it up for like $4 years after release and gave it a reluctant stab, and no, not for me.\n\nIve always tried \u201clightning returns\u201d and i understand its a sequel or whatever but its even worse - you really have to like random chaotic shit with cheesey jrpg outfits and dialogue to put up with either game. \n\nGone are much of the staples of ff that the older gamers (me) fell in love with. It isnt all bad im sure, but the games just werent made for \u201cff fans\u201d and that much was immediately obvious. We, the diehard nerds before being a gamer was socially accepted, propped up these games and gave square *snd* enix the means to thrive and they returned the favor by giving ignoring us and grabbing closer to the mainstream. \n\nI get it, im 38 im seriously not mad, i have moved way on from 90s jrpgs and find the best gaming of my life keeps happening every year. This is really in part thanks to rhe same ideology squareenix adopted that \u201cruined\u201d final fantasy for all us hardcases who might have bitched the loudest. But this is where the ire comes from - it isnt *just* that our pretty ff baby grew up, its that the majority, probably vast majority, of 90s FF fans were really escaping into those games and attached a lot of emotional value to them, and we loved the company thay gave us rhem, then watched all that rudely disappear and other gamers tell us \u201clol you old\u201d.

            "body": "I feel like FF13 is perfectly designed to be misleading to a lot of fans. Its characters start out as unlikeable people, but that's because they develop throughout the game. The combat seems shallow at first- but that's only because it's slow to introduce its mechanics.\n\nYet this bad first impression has likely lead to a lot of people writing it off before giving it a chance. Citing it has a bad story and shallow combat without actually understanding all of the game's content. it doesn't help that it's a pretty hard game and, like a most FF stories can be kinda confusing at times.\n\nBut if you're willing to give it a chance, you'll realize it's actually a REALLY good game. Not perfect mind you, the linearity is a fair complaint, and there are some things its story can do better. FF13-2 also shows there's some QoL improvements you can make to the gameplay too. (Though I think 13 has better combat by the merit of just being far harder.) It's a gem in the rough.\n\nThe entire trilogy is REALLY good too. 13-2 has a really good story and while it's easier, it's still got some really good gameplay that fixes some things from 13. Lightning Returns has a good story isolated, even if kinda edgy, but it has one of the best combat systems in the entire series.\n\nAll 3 games are really experimental and unique, they deserve to be remembered and looked at for everything they did, despite their flaws.",

In fact I think all the games after it suffer from a similar lack of quality as well, to varying degrees.\n\nIt has a few exquisite facets - graphics, music, etc - that FF is known for. But the gameplay and narrative is horrid. As others have pointed out in innumerable other threads, some of the reaction in context is also that 13 had a long convoluted development with sky high promises on the back of what many consider the golden age of FF - 6-12 - that made the end reception of 13 even more stark.\n\nSome people like the game, but the wider reception is what it is because the game just isn\u2019t great.",

This is what a final fantasy game is supposed to be like!' (though, i think I recall the complaints being 'it's not the whole world!  just 1 country!') \n\nAlong comes FF13.  and, from a story telling perspective, it did everything the same as the previous titles.  except this time the 'corridor' that you play through is sometimes a literal corridor.  They still gave you the 'open world' at the end, but you go to this whole new place (Pulse) and it's different from the full map exploring of the previous games, so you feel kind of cheated?  Even though, to be honest, it's not any different from the other games.  you follow the story by going where the story tells you to go, and at the end you can over level and do some exploring....",

I love how the characters untangle their grievances to accept their circumstance to them defy their destiny. I love the PS3-ness of its UI.\n\nHowever, it has too many flaws to be called a good game imo. The combat system is interesting, though the enemies feel like they react too fast at times, so unless you're casting haste the battles feel unfair, especially when there's a sudden difficulty spike in a few chapters. \n\nAlso, though I don't mind the game being linear, the first few chapters and chapter 10 take it to an extreme. The first few hours are indeed just hallways of enemies. It gets better later, but then you get to chapter 10 and you're again in endless corridors in an ugly metallic brown environment.\n\nWhen I got to Gran Pulse, I almost quit the game as I was burned out of it, and the game suddenly opened up. Got my ass kicked plenty of times and the new missions just aren't that interesting to grind. I'm still playing this game though, I want to at least finish its story to have a full opinion of it.",

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anyone argue any of those things. You like cinematic games that are trying to be like movies and yeah, I guess it\u2019s good at that. The linear complaints are hugely subjective, and will be more off putting for some people. \n\nMy issues with it are that it\u2019s terribly written and spends hours dumping boring exposition on you which is stuffed with the worst kind of made up word fantasy jargon. It takes hours to really get to know the characters because they\u2019re all so busy going on and on about how the world works. If it was a movie, I would\u2019ve turned it off after ten minutes. \n\nI think it\u2019s funny that people who like things that aren\u2019t popular always try to make excuses about why they\u2019re unpopular. It has to be that people are jumping on a bandwagon and not thinking for themselves, not just that most people don\u2019t like the thing but you do. I\u2019m sure there are people who have never played XIII who say it\u2019s bad. But realistically that general idea that the game is bad was formed by a lot of us who were massive fans of the series, bought it at launch and didn\u2019t have fun.

The game is almost written like a soap opera, while the grander story about Fal'Cie takes a seat.\n\nAlso, the series has always had \"made up word fantasy jargon.\" How many games have their own \"ancients\" or stuff like mako and materia, the cetra? Eidolons and Eikons, mother crystals...  \nIt's just that those things are either tradition so we're used to them, or new stuff is mixed in with the familiar stuff. Nobody questions it when Bahamut or Gilgamesh comes back in an FF game.\n\nIt's just that FF13 recognized this and decided \"Hey, let's try crafting some new ideas for once. Why not make a new mythos to go with the old one?\" Fal'Cie and L'Cie, despite having silly names, are meant to be homages to Crystals and how in past games they locked people into the fate of being \"Warriors of Light\", but in FF13 they put a twist on it by making this a bad thing.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, I get the names and new terms sounding silly, but FF games having fantasy mythos and terms and stuff is pretty common.",

XIII was one that I am looking forward to revisiting because I did like it just fine the first time I played it, but didn't think it was especially good. Just solid, really. I'm curious how I'll feel in a replay. It's also tough in a franchise like this because even if it's good, if it's a weaker installment in a franchise that has a lot of bangers, it's going to feel a little more disappointing than it otherwise would.\n\nI will say though, the whole \"felt like a movie\" thing is sort of the thing I remember brushing up against. I kinda don't really want my games to feel like a movie if I'm honest. I remember it feeling a little too linear for its own good, and little too cutscene to cutscene for my preference. \n\nBut yeah, I wouldn't say I thought it was bad!",

I personally consider FF7 the blueprint for the typical AAA game in that regard.\n\nSquare attempted to take it a step further with their ambitions but comically bad movie spirits within which almost ended the company then and there.\nI think FF13 comes the closest to actually being a blockbuster level game in terms of presentation.\n\nI do admit that it is more like an interactive movie than a game at times and especially in its opening chapters.\nThis is actually a big gripe of mine as well. It\u2019s opening being the way it is drove people away Id imagine as many people on Reddit only vaguely know about the significantly more open pulse later on.",

The story line of FF13 essentially being fugitives forcing you to just march forward interacting with floating computers for items made it feel too on rails. I like it more than 16 and 15 for sure. Good cast of characters. Decent twist on turn based combat.",

I got into the series ages ago but always skipped over 13 because everybody told me not to bother, but earlier this year i realised it was the only mainline game i hadn't played so i tracked down a second hand copy. I honestly really enjoyed my time with it. I have my fair share of issues with it to but i am glad i played it. The combat takes a long time to get going but i did end up enjoying it for its uniqueness. i adore the art design and the music. I ultimately view it as a game with a lot of potential that it never quite lived up to.  it has a really interesting world, characters and gameplay systems, but doesn't really do anything with them.",

            "body": "I think to understand the backlash that Final Fantasy 13 received at the time, you have to put it in the context of when it was released.\n\nFinal Fantasy fans were still clinging to the golden age where Square put out banger after banger after banger. FF12 was well-received, but it was a departure from the standard and considered just a blip, rather than the end of that \u201cgolden age\u201c. FF 13 was the first next-gen entry, and a triumphant return to traditional turn based.\n\nThen it released. Auto battle was controversial. The Crystarium was controversial. The story was a bit opaque, jargon heavy, and considered a downgrade, not from 12, but from the 6-10 heyday. Some of the characters were criticized. The very linear gameplay with minimal interaction with the setting was \u2014very\u2014 controversial. \u201cExtended tutorial\u201d was a term bandied about a lot. FF13 was the poster child of \u201cif you just keep playing it for 30 hours it gets real good\u201d.\n\nMe personally, I bought it Day 1. I got 25 hours or so in and bounced off. The story just didn\u2019t capture me the way golden age FFs did. I didn\u2019t care about any of the characters. Didn\u2019t really understand what was going on. The battle system was alright but not enough to keep me going. \n\nI\u2019ve been meaning to pick it up again at some point and give it another shot. Maybe I can pay closer attention to the story and battle systems and find something to get me through that 30 hours. Opinion on 13 has definitely softened with 15 and 16 being even more radical departures from old school FF.",

XIII is its linearity but the rest is pretty good. For XV it is its disjointed story and lackluster combat system but the cast, graphics, music and the story that is fleshed out is good. \n\nDespite the flaws they have I would still recommend to play both, especially if you're a FF fan, since they're quite enjoyable and unique nonetheless, with something interesting to offer which is what Final Fantasy guarantees.",
