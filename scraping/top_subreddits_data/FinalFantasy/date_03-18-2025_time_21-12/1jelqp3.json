    "selftext": "At least, impossible to beat reliably. I'm level 45, party order is Ninja, BM, WM, and Knight. Knight using Giant's Glove for Saber, Ninja and BM spamming Temper; Ninja dying is okay, which is why he's up front. WM spamming Heals and Protera. At one point I stacked Protera 5 times, and had 12 stacks of temper plus Saber on Knight. Chaos out of fucking nowhere takes 4 turns in a row with no delay and one taps my entire party in sequence. I had literally no opportunity to respond, just bam, bam, bam, bam, dead.\n\nWhich is when I made this post. It was the most blatantly unfair thing I've ever seen in a game. Is this a bug? Nowhere that I've been able to find does it say Chaos can take multiple turns in a row without you able to respond, but it just happened to me. It felt like the game decided to just turn my party off and send me to the loading screen. It was crazy.",

A few hours of grinding and you should be good. My 8 year old and I beat him quite easily once we gained a bunch of levels",

                    "body": "I actually did just beat him, my post was more to do with the fact that he randomly spammed 4 turns in a row, with a hefty dose of salt I admit. Because if the boss can just decide to switch off your entire party like that with no possibility of response, that's a bunch of shit.\n\nBut it was one of those things where, when I beat him, it didn't feel like I *beat* him, if that makes sense. In the last fight, he just spammed elemental attacks at me, which I can easily handle with Ribbons and Protera. Never used Earthquake, never used Cura, and never used his single target physical attack which has a propensity to one-shot even with several stacks of Protera. \n\nAnd he certainly didn't take 4 turns in a row. So I sorta feel like I just got lucky rather than outplayed him. Which is what I meant by it feeling impossible to beat him *reliably*, unless you just stat check him with absurdly high levels.\n\nThe rest of the game was fantastic of course. Got me excited to finally go through the whole series.",
