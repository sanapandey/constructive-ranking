    "selftext": "I've lived a lucky life of never having to deal with an overflowing grease trap, or being told to clean one out. I'm taking over management of a small kitchen as a sous chef, and my chef wants to make sure I know how to do all the jobs, so today we cleaned out the grease trap.\n\nIt's not a hard job, we had a shop wet vac that makes it very easy. But OH MY GOD THE SMELL! I've had many people tell me how bad the smell is, but there's just no comparing it until you smell it for yourself. Wow, it's easily the worst thing I've ever smelt. I'd stick my nose in a skunks ass just to clean my sinuses from that.\n\nTo everyone who has had to clean out one of those stink boxes, I salute you!",

Grabbed a broom stick and just moved it in the ends, bearing the stench. Air was vile and you'd think the sludge were solid ground till you poke it with a stick... Ugh, just remembering it makes me want to vomit. Cheers, bud n",
