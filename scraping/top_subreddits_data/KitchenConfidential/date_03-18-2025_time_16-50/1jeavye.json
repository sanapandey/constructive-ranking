    "selftext": "This knife has been with me for over 6 years. It\u2019s my daily driver and has been through a lot of ups and downs with me. Every night before I leave I wrap it in a towel, plastic wrap and put it away in one of our \u201ctool boxes\u201d in the kitchen. \n\nI came in to close yesterday and found it out and dirty on the station. Nobody including my chef will cop to it. \n\nI guess I should have been more careful and taken it home with me, but coworkers and my chef do the same with their knives and leave them wrapped up at work before they leave. Everyone is generally respectful of this and knows not to use these knives, we have plenty of house knives to choose from. \n\nI was visibly upset. But what can I really do ya know. \n\nAnyways, any insight about this possibly being ground out, or ideas about changing the blade profile to make the tip useable again? ",
