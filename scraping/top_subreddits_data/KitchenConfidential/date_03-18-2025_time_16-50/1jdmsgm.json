I haven't met a single person that has had a wedding not saying they didn't get to eat and were exhausted at the end of the night. \n\nNot sure if it is a new age thing, but weddings are largely very stressful and exhausting for the bride and groom. \n\nMy fiance and I decided to not do a wedding for that reason (and the exorbitant costs). We are renting a huge house for a long weekend and inviting those that would have been the wedding party to just party for a weekend. Both of our families are in a similar geographic location so we are going to host a large dinner so everyone can meet.",

I\u2019d be going in on the rye, the cheeses, and the grapes. Good call too on the chops and salsa: kids are usually only going to take what they can identify.\n\nThere\u2019s a long tubular dip tray I can\u2019t figure out, so I\u2019m wondering what it is?",
