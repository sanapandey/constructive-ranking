The impact or break in that pane starts at the very top. It\u2019s unlikely that it was directly caused by a cook hitting the glass with an object. Depending on how tight the pane fits inside the frame and whether rubber spacers/setting blocks were used, it could have been from the door being closed too hard or tweaked. Either way chalk it up to bad luck or that it would inevitably have broken. Call out a mom and pop glass shop in your area. Tempered has to be made to size at a glass factory, so be prepared for a wait of a week+.",
