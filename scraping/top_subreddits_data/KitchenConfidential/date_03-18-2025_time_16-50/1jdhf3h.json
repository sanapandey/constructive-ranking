He was ok but then I noticed him hovering over a soup and adding stuff to it! Before I could stop it the soup went out but they said it was really good so he got hired in\n\n\nBut now he's acting weird speaking to himself and spending a lot of time in the walk in and he's always wearing his hat too ",
