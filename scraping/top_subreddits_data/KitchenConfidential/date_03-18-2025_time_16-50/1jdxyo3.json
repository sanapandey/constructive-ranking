    "selftext": "Quick background, my older brother became gluten free after realising he was intolerant to it and I had to suffer through 3 years of a gluten free household cause our mother decided that if he couldn\u2019t have it I couldn\u2019t either (even though he only reacted to eating it). I hated it, he hated it, our mother probably hated it. Thus, I know firsthand how hard it is to find tasty gluten free substitutes that don\u2019t dry out your mouth before you even take a bite, taste oddly sweet, and just in general aren\u2019t the same as a good old pack of instant ramen. \n\nSo when a gluten free ticket comes my way, I sympathise. I wipe down everything, grab freshly cleaned dishes and pull from the bottom of the cambro because it\u2019s the least likely to have a light dusting of flour on it (I work in a bakery/resturant so there\u2019s flour everywhere). I also give them extra stuff. Want a gluten free blt? Extra bacon, and extra chips on the side. Gluten free pizza? Extra toppings. I know how hard it is to find a resturant that does gluten free things right, and I know my coworkers hate working with anything gluten free, and most of all, I know how much it sucks having to live like that. My kitchen manager thinks I\u2019m a doofus for giving them extra, but he said as long as the owner doesn\u2019t see it I can do what I want. So, I like to brighten their days in what little ways I can. \u263a\ufe0f  ",

I'd feel bad for the customers who get used to your TLC and then end up there when you're not working, ha.  \n\nThat's actually very nice of your mom. Assuming your brother had Celiac and not just gluten intolerance, people with Celiac can get sick over weeks or months from amounts of gluten they don't have a perceptible reaction to. It's much safer to be in an entirely gluten free environment.",

I would say I'm sorry but we don't have an option in the kitchen for gluten free pizza, but we can work with you in the rest of the menu--pick something that sounds good and I will find out if it can be made gluten free. \n\nIt's a fun challenge for the server to have someone who needs help to be safe. I always liked it--felt like I had a special extra responsibility to the diner who needed special consideration, like suddenly I'm moonlighting in healthcare! \n\nSometimes, there is no gluten free option, as was true of our pizza. But gluten free, lactose intolerant, vegan, vegetarian, even restricted salt intake are easy to accommodate in a scratch kitchen. \n\nThe last place I worked had a high standard and was one of the best restaurants in the city. The kitchen were not about to serve bad food so there were dishes they refused to alter in certain ways. But they would actually get excited to make one of our dishes as good as it could be while accommodating the intolerance. Chefs like to feed people good food; don't apologize for having limitations. \n\nI've never worked at chain restaurants where lots of the kitchen is basically microwaving food cooked elsewhere. (A friend had worked at an Applebee's before our restaurant and explained that his role as expediter in that place was kind of the microwaves.) YMMV but a good restaurant is ready to adapt for dietary restrictions and most of the time they enjoy the variation. (I would go to the people doing the cooking and ask them if they could make a special version of something and their faces would light up--i would notice they made adjustments to the whole dish to make it safe and still delicious. I remember one guy I loved who was a gifted chef. He would say, \"I'm a beast! of course I can make that dish without X and I'll probably give them more Y so it tastes like something without that X. I'll make it, and I'll make it not-gross!\")",

Some do treat gluten free eating as a fad diet, but for those actually living with that disease, it's an absolute necessity. My wife lived undiagnosed for years - constant stomach pain, joint pain, week or weeks long constipation, and very malnourished - her iron levels were so low and white blood cell counts so high doctors thought she may have leukemia. \n\nBut one of her doctors, an oncologist, of all docs, not a dietitian or gastroenterologist, finally had an epiphany, looking at the whole of her symptoms, noticed the digestive issues, and suggested we go gluten free. Within a month, the worst of the digestive symptoms went away, and over time, her bloodwork has normalized. Turns out, with celiac disease, gluten reactions can cause intestinal inflammation, and over time, tissue scarring, that inhibits the intestines ability to absorb nutrients - so no matter what she ate, she wasn't getting most of the nutrients, and the constant inflamation of many of her soft tissues were causing the high white blood cell counts.\n\nLong story short - your efforts are appreciated! \ud83d\udc4d",
