Yelled at another manager about complaints over people smoking marijuana... his words. While he 100% was on coke or some shit. The DM would fucking change my schedule weekly even though I set it up to the (mostly) kid's schedules they COULD work. He literally had me take down the warnings in the scheduler that would stop you from scheduling people when they can't work.\n\nEasiest way to keep an employee:\n\n1. pay\n2. schedule\n3. respect\n\nHe cared about none. See how my rambling goes? Sorry I type like 170 wpm last I checked.\n\nLast straw was they went to move me to another store cuz some fat pervert wanted my store and sucked the DMs scrote. Guy said \"Well that's why I don't schedule myself alone with the teen girls.\" Who had kids himself... Nobody thinks about shit like that except perverts. Itched his belly and stood right up on them while he \"trained\" 16 year olds.",
