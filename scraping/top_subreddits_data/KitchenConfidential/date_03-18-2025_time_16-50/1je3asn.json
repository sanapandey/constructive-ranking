Workers at a coffee shop are not paid for every cup they brew. Workers are instead paid for our time, we are paid by the hour. And it is the hourly wage that misdirects our attention as workers, making us ignorant of the theft taking place. \n\nImagine a barista who works at an independent coffee shop and gets paid $17 an hour \u2014 about $500 a week after taxes. How many hours would it take for the worker to make and sell $500 worth of coffee? Subtracting production resources is simple. When a capitalist rents a storefront, buys the equipment, and orders the unprepared ingredients, they can predict how long it will take for them to use up those resources before they have to buy more. Therefore, we can come up with an average amount that the capitalist is spending per hour, per worker, on production resources and see where the rest of the money goes.\n\nIf this coffee shop spends, hypothetically, 217 dollars an hour on production resources and sells 250 dollars worth of coffee per hour, we know that the worker is adding a value of 33 dollars to the coffee sold every hour. That means that after 15 hours and 9 minutes, less than two shifts, the barista will have made enough money for the company to cover their entire week\u2019s paycheck. So, after working for 15 hours and 9 minutes and adding $500 worth of value, does the worker get to take off their apron and go home? No. The worker will continue to work, and every additional dollar they make for every additional hour they work will go directly to the capitalist. That\u2019s 24 hours, 51 minutes at a value of 797 dollars! But once their check is covered, the worker is now working for free. This unpaid labor time is the actual source of the capitalist\u2019s \u201cprofits\u201d. \n\nWe see now that capitalists are not industrious hard workers, brilliant innovators, or job creators \u2014 they are thieves, pure and simple. The capitalist regime derives its incredible, awe-inspiring wealth by stealing from you. This is why the capitalist regime is constantly spreading disinformation about the way our economy works. They can't have an honest conversation about our economy \u2014 or our politics \u2014 or even the nature of their \"mom and pop business \u2014 without exposing their guilt.",
