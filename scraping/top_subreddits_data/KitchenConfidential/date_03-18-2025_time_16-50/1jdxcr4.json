Got a graduate degree in social work and parlayed all my skills from kitchens into selling myself for the job I have now. Surprisingly, you can turn yourself into a fantastic substance use counselor when you spent 15 years working around functional (and sometimes not functional) addicts. There\u2019s nothing a client is going to tell me that I haven\u2019t already seen. My 15 years of work in kitchens gave me the ability to meet with and talk to pretty much anyone. On a relatability level, my clients really appreciate that I\u2019m not just someone who studied some books and are now dictating how they should live. Kitchens gave me a plethora of street smarts and an insight into worlds some of my fellow graduates have never been exposed to. I landed my current job by selling those skills of having worked with substance users, the unhoused, undocumented immigrants, refugees, and the formerly incarcerated and really understanding what their day to day life is actually like. I landed my current job by talking all that up, despite being a recent graduate with no official experience in the field. I make almost twice as much as I did (even as an executive chef) but now with only a 40 hour week, benefits, holidays, weekends, vacations, and health insurance. The work is mentally taxing for sure and has its own set of systemic issues. But I\u2019m much more comfortable and financially stable in my life now than I ever was in kitchens. \n\nI will say though, there is still a ton of foolery that occurs that many don\u2019t expect from a \u201cprofessional\u201d environment. Co-workers still be fucking and it be hella dramatic.  Apparently that\u2019s just an inescapable part of the human condition. Lmao.",
