I'm also not impressed with the weapons this time around. \n\nThere's really just something lacking with the 2nd collab, and the fact that there's no proper music video like Perfect Night just makes it so thrown-together in my opinion. Also they did not need to make those recolors. Why not just re-release the old skins as they have in the past.",

I also wish she had her hair half up in the buns and half down or something. The two buns are cute, but it messes up her silhouette a little.\n\nAshe's outfit would be peak if they threw her hood down, gave her white hair, and used her iconic Red instead of giving her Widows colours. Idk why they did that.\n\nI just wish they kept the characters' identities consistent and recognisable like they did last time. The SFX are also worse than the last Le Serrafim skins which I didn't think was possible.",
