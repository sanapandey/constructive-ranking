She just infinitely chains between bubbles and Ana nade/ Kiriko suzu, whilst holding W + M1 to microwave an entire team to death. \n\nPeople claiming Rein counters her... Lmao.

She had the least counters and if there is a rein chances are you will have a blast dps or spamming al fire to get rid of it. Saying that makes me think you don\u2019t play the game or you\u2019re just at low ranks lol.",

I gotta say it's really annoying hearing the humming and beeping of the game telling you to select a perk for a large portion of the game, when you don't want to nerf yourself and thus not select a major ~~perk~~ downgrade.\n\nWhitehat continues to make it so you may accidentally target an ally when you want to target an enemy. On top of incentivizing bad plays.\n\nAnd the range reduction on Stack Overflow continues to gut your hack as an interrupt tool, for Hamster, Reapers ult, Pharah, anyone really. You were better off not picking a major ~~perk~~ before, and you will continue to be better off not picking a major ~~perk~~ now. What they should do is completely remove the range reduction on Stack Overflow and replace Whitehat with something else entirely.",
