These three, as well as Torb who WAS nerfed, have been absolutely dominant. Oppresively so. \n\nI'm really enjoying OW again, but seriously, what does is the balance team cooking? Even if they are going purely off win rates, which is a stupid balance philosophy, surely at least Ana is going crazy in low ranks too? \n\nOh well. At least another month of Sojourn Mercy. Fun!",

Ana double nano is so much free value its insane, why is there no drawback like halving its efficacy or duration? Surely there are middle grounds with some of these perks?? Also Sojourn should have been nerfed to 225 its such a simple number change.",

It was very frustrating. \n\nThe only time it felt smooth and somewhat enjoyable was when the team did 2-2-2 as I thought it was going to be initially when I heard 6v6 comp was coming in mid season.
