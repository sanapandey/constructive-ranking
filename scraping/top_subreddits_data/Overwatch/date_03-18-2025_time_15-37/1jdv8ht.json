On top of them having a Q&A where only 1-2 of the members got to answer the question before the host moved on and then they didnt even perform so it was a big ?? stream from start to finish",

It was clear everyone was having a good time on both teams and just being silly. Sakura can clearly play more than the others and she was like yelling out instructions and telling her team where to go haha. \n\nThe girl who was playing Mercy (can\u2019t remember which) was sooo cute. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s ever touched WASD or even a video game in her life. Her little scream and standing in place when the enemy Reaper came up to kill her took me out lol. It reminded me of being new at the game again and I thought all of their vibes were adorable. Also super cute seeing Aspen and Yun Jin yapping the whole time lol.\n\nAnd the lack of applause was awkward at first too but then I realized the sound just wasn\u2019t picking up the applause from the tiny audience there. You could hear them better later on. \n\nThe most disappointing part was not all of the girls getting to answer the questions but I\u2019m guessing they were on strict time constraints so that\u2019s just the way it goes. I\u2019d rather they just get all the answers to one question though.\n\nIdk overall I was very happy I watched. I\u2019m not a K-pop person but I thought it was all pretty cute and fun.",

Anything to do with the fimmies is a joy to watch though. Kazuhas Mercy might have left me with the biggest smile on my face in a long time. \"E E\"",
