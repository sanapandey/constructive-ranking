    "selftext": "So I've seen on this reddit a lot people talking about \"over-extending\" being a reason for dying, but this is actually a well known internet misconception much like the omitted logic behind NASA's expensive pens. It's important to always go in every time even if you ditch the team around a corner. Why? The reason is simple, you can't build up an immunity to dying without dying. It's much like how in order to become immune to snake bites you let them bite you in smaller increments and eventually you will be able to survive multiple snakes at once.\n\nThe Hanzo standing directly in front of the nano boosted enemy Mauga? He is limit testing, sharpening his mind with every button he presses. Not only is he much wiser than you for doing this, he will come out of spawn even stronger than before because he is learning the nano boosted point blank Mauga matchup while YOU may never learn how to outplay when you inevitably find yourself in this scenario.\n\nWhat we really need to talk about on this sub is the very real phenomenon of UNDER extending. And we all know the cause: fear. The mind killer. Ashe takes a long time to reload, but actually if you stand in point blank range, not only does your coach gun deal vastly more damage, but you can melee the enemy without any need to reload. It's just basic damage optimization that you should be up close. Mercy has an ability that specifically is designed to let her fly towards an ally so she can get in range to be more accurate with her gun. Zenyatta deals additional damage when he kicks enemies. Lifeweaver has an ability specifically designed to force your teammates to get closer to the enemy.\n\nThe next time you see your teammate \"overextend\" just think to yourself \"I should have also gone in, stay hard, no excuses\" and you'll quickly rank up. Probably.",

That's what \"extending\" is about, and it helps if the tank is creating space.\n\nMy biggest problem is that people have an absolute fear of dying, but it can create opportunity. That doesn't mean throw yourself 1v5, but push forward for your backline to gain better position and hope that they will follow, in heal and damage.\n\nAnd yes, some of you may die, but pressing forward is the only way to gain control of line of sights and objectives.\n\nI see constantly that players react very poorly to aggressive teams that play \"in your face\", because it's challenging that conception that the fight is won by poking 5 enemy players out of existence.",

I've tried teaching him that blaming others wont make you better but some people cant get over thier ego.\n\nThe best way to learn in most any game is to take the risks that you know you will be punished from and learn what went wrong and adjust your gameplan.

After \"W key\" into a 5 stack fails a few times in a row, maybe reevaluate the game plan.\n\nMy low death count is rarely ever because I'm playing passive, it's because I recognize that a 2 or 3v5 is often not winnable so I make the executive decision to GTFO while helping my remaining teammates the best I can. An aggressive play style does not mean ignoring positioning and never using the map to your advantage to survive.",
