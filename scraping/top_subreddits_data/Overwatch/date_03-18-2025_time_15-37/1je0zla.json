It does benefit a lot from team coordination of course (absent in 99% of games) but it's an important offensive tool. Use it to dodge/TP back and forth in a close range team fight, use it to escape ults (Zarya grav, Bastion artillery and Mauga cage are the easiest to implement this on since you don't need split-second reaction time), go on off-angles, go to high ground, TP your team to the point, set it up as an LW pull for someone coming back from spawn, are all easier-to-implement strategies but it goes even beyond that.\n\nThe TP health regeneration perk really helps give her an extra edge as a glass cannon in brawls too.\n\nNerdbrain has a good number of in-depth Sym guides generally worth watching, his turret guide helped me really improve my placements.",
