Illari looks the best, but the green colour scheme bugs me. Mercy kept her signature orange, and the skin looks better ingame than it does in any of the renders or art imo. So I'll give them props for somewhat maintaining  her character identity... Even if it didn't translate well in renders or art.\n\nAshe just doesn't feel like Ashe. Bob looks cool, but they should have given her white hair and chose a red colour scheme instead of purple. I also dislike the hood and cat ears. Her character identity is out the window.\n\nJuno's model looks really off imo. Her weapon is really cute though.\n\nD.Va's Mech uses same model as the other Le Serrafim skin, and her outfit in the other skin appeals to me more as it maintains D.Vas character identity more. So idk why I'd buy this one. It's not bad though, I just prefer the other one.\n\nThe SFX this time are honestly almost non-existent. I had the same issue with the last Le Serrafim skins, but the skin designs kinda carried the last collab anyways so it never bothered me. These ones don't even have good SFX.\n\nThe dance emotes are reused for the victory poses, I'd have preferred they have victory poses similar to the heart poses from the last collab. Would have been cute to see all the girls do a similar little pose at the end of a match, oh well.\n\nAside from Mercy and Illari ones, this collab is meh imo.",
