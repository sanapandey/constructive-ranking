Also can't wait for stadium mode, since it's an evolution of the mutation mode my friends and I loved so much.  Just hoping the 7 round thing doesn't make it awful, or that it doesn't let the winning team continue to steamroll by getting more xp.",

And you also get more XP the longer the match goes on. Not to mention perks reset between rounds on hybrid/escort and everyone gets level 3 perks from round 3 onwards. \n\nI don't think it's bad at all. Definitely has stopped some people counter swapping, which I don't think is a bad thing. I hate playing counterwatch. Perks generally, imo, make more heroes viable against other heroes.",

But I do have to disagree about being hard countered. I've not yet found that at all.\n\nI didn't say hard countered, i said countered harder, Im a firm believer that the game is complex enough that you can never boil it down to a matchup hard countering another one, I think its copletely fair to say that some heroes got the short end of the stick, because that will happen with every change, whilst yes some heroes are more viable in general, other heroes are less viable\n\n>A lost fight is a lost fight with or without perks. If it was going to snowball, it was going to with or without perks.\n\nThis is an insane take, are you trying to tell me that perks dont change the outcome fights? then surely I could just never pick a perk and be completely fine, but obviously thats not the case, and you are missing the point of games becoming more snowbally, its not that equal games get worse, its that games which you where disadvantged become less likely to win, and games that where equal become more swingy so you can be disadvantaged after the first fight or so",

I have no issues reading the game and what perks people have and I rarely have to even check the scoreboard. If you're struggling, you're either not paying attention or not allowing yourself to learn. I'll have a quick glance using tab occasionally, as you would during normal gameplay to check stats & ult charges, but I've never found myself spending an excess of time reading perks. You'll get there - just learn to know what to look out for and how to read the game, like you have been with abilities and heroes for years. I've no issues knowing what perks people have from just looking at the game or glancing briefly at the icons and making an educated guess. Most of the icons are very self explanatory and you're fine to guess - chances are you'll be right.\n\nAnd yeah I said that in my other comment. Some perks are bad, some are very good. Great thing then that the devs to balance passes and have already said they're gonna make changes.\n\nPerks alone *don't* change the outcome of a fight. They help to swing fights, obviously. The outcome is determined by the team and players. Ana has double nade? Well take her out or take corners so it doesn't bounce to you. Torb has wall turret? Well just shoot the turret like you normally do, but this time maybe look up. \n\nAnd yes you can go a whole match without picking a perk if you want. That is a choice that you are allowed to make. In fact I had a game yesterday where both my tank and 1 support refused to pick perks AND we won. \n\nI still disagree on them being more snowbally, that's not something I've experienced at all. It feels about the same as before perks. Only difference I've noticed is that it feels like snowballs can be turned around more with perks than before, but that's likely the same story with switching heroes yknow. If you're getting diffed hard enough for it to snowball and you lose a match (or as you say you lose and were already expected to lose), I don't think perks are to blame...",

And in around 80% of the games, the tank also counter swapped. Sure, the perks help, but counter swapping is still just so overpowered. It\u2019s the quickest, easiest, most brain dead solution to win a match. IMO the exp boost after swapping needs to be removed. You shouldn\u2019t be able to swap and THEN also get a catch up mechanic to get your perks. I\u2019ve legit had games where I\u2019ve seen the enemy tank swap, role out and destroy us in the next team fight, and then max out their perk level half way through the 2nd fight. That is INSANELY fast. Then they\u2019re on the same level as me AND playing a better character and they didn\u2019t really sacrifice or lose anything in the process. It\u2019s a fine idea but it\u2019s just not enough. Counter swapping is just too good. That, and some characters just don\u2019t have perks that really benefit them. Some characters have perks that overcome there weaknesses, like Orisa, that help them sustain through counter picks. Some, like Rein, have perks that do literally nothing to help him against his counters. IMO they need to change like, 1/3 of the perks in the game, rebalance some other ones, and also remove the catch up part of the perks system after swapping. THEN I could see it being good. But right now it\u2019s just not there.",
