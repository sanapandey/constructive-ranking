            "body": "Very cool concept. I think this would hero would have an instant cult following like doom. Also, I think Overwatch needs a dagger/spear melee hero so this fills that niche very nicely.\n\n\nA couple things on the kit concept:\n\n- I\u2019d like to see melee be the primary and throwing the knife as a secondary or vice versa. The kit seems to suggest that getting in there and brawling/assassinating is the playstyle, so the weapon should reflect that\n\n\n- Kalb has no disengage tool besides walking away with block. In theory block could be used to kite/slow, but in practice I imagine the play would be to just walk forward/follow and murder him when the block ends\n\n\n- Kalb\u2019s mobility is tied to hitting a skill shot. I think this would be kind of difficult to play in practice. If you use it to engage, you\u2019re leaving yourself with no escape options but block unless you kill the enemy. I think it\u2019d be a lot more flexible if you could just throw it somewhere and tele to it as a setup or disengage tool that disappears after X time. Could have a cool sand disappearing effect upon activation too\n\n\n- To solve the mobility issue, I think adding a passive to bleed could help. Add a small but long bleed on knife melees/throws and increase move speed for any bleeds applied up to X% (15?). call it something like \u201cscent for blood\u201d or \u201cSanguine fixation.\u201d That way, if you\u2019re hitting shots you can hunt them down/kite away easier with block\n\n\nLove the design overall and wish you luck! Hopefully blizzard sends you an offer lol",

Sombras stealth is really obnoxious i feel because of the hacking part of her kit and a lot of factors in her history. right now its in part due to single tanks having weaker backlines.",

Oasis in this case is a city founded and ruled mostly by scientists, although technology advanaced and even peacefull, they also believe in science without any barrier including most ethics, which is where Moira settled after blackwatch until eventually joining Talon. Hence its implied they have a lot of things undercover from the public mostly dark experiments. this idea i gave is based on that, an experiment of what would be an \"ultimate lifeform\" (no, he is not Shadow the Hedgehog) created in a lab, highly adaptable, inteligent and obviously strong, anthropormorphic to an extent with beastly traits but not really belonging to any species. one trait i imagined for hum was that he would have a third eye on top of its skull thats elongated like most predators, but would only open in certain circunstances. he wouldnt really be a cyborg, as the scientists wanted to make something without relying on cyber enhancements, but he would have gotten tech gear with null sector, some exo suit with weapons and stuff, i imagined like energy claws and electrified tail, and a grapple hook that would be reverse of roadhogs, to propel himself into a target.",

I'd hate to finally work my way up to an ult and only get to sneak attack someone with my sped-up normal moves.\n\nWhat if the ult is the same but he can attack while invisible, and is consequently only revealed to the player(s) taking damage from him? Kind of like a \"Big Bird trying to convince people that he's seeing Snuffleupagus\" situation. Maybe the only attack he can use while ulting in this instance is a Hyper Quicksand sort of freeze-the-enemy-in-place (like Mei)?\n\nMaybe I have had too much coffee this morning.",
