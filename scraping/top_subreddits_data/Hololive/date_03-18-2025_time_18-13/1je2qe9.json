You could say like \"\u30d5\u30ec\u30a2\u306f\u30a4\u30ca\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30ac\u3067\u3059 / Flare is a fan girl of Ina\" or maybe \"\u30e9\u30d7\u30e9\u30b9\u306f\u30c8\u30ef\u69d8\u306e\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30ac\u3067\u3059 / La+ is a fan girl of Towa-sama\".  \nI've heard it when it was used by Sui-chan describing Iroha, cuz Iroha is a notable Hoshiyomi/Suisei's \"fan girl\".\n\nBtw my twitter translated \"simping\" into \"\u7518\u3048\u308b\", which means something along the lines of \"she's being sweet so that she can maybe ask the person for what she wants\".",
