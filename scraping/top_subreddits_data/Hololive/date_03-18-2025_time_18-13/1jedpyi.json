ID bros were (and are) actually worse about this to be sure. Her OG default actually takes some inspiration from the Barong, a mythical Balinese monster and enemy of the demon queen Rangda (ty Wikipedia). Likely she had some feedback in her own character\u2019s lore and outfit design. The gorilla motif she\u2019s gone with after getting her New Year\u2019s outfit is probably her going for the same thing as the Barong.\n\nI get her really not wanting to identify as a penguin, when she wants to be badass, but it\u2019s a bit of a shame because she had more in common with penguins than just her appearance: penguins rarely sleep for more than a few minutes at a time.",
