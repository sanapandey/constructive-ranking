Once a member has debuted, there's zero incentive to mandate some sort of streaming quota, the IP assets are de facto locked to a particular contractor. So brand loyalty trumps content output, especially with streaming ad revenue being an afterthought.\n\n> stuff that's hard to reschedule\n\nThis also has cascading effects, not only do we not want to irritate the sponsors, but rescheduling for later pushes something *else* out of the schedule, which also needs to be rescheduled and ticks off someone else, etc. etc. etc. Huge pain, hence why they push themselves so hard to stay on schedule, even why they shouldn't.",
