And people from her fan discord have seen some people arguing about this on tweeter/X. \n\nLet's respect her wishes and not feed too much into these jokes here too.\n\nsource:   \n[https://x.com/suisei\\_submati/status/1901887274041872595](https://x.com/suisei_submati/status/1901887274041872595)  \n[https://x.com/suisei\\_submati/status/1901886412057960782](https://x.com/suisei_submati/status/1901886412057960782)\n\n\nEdit: thanks for some of the comments pointing out she also asked us to not be aggressively policing these jokes too.",

                    "body": "\"It's not good for her brand\" is an understatement. People who are not familiar with Hololive who want to check out the collab will see the comments and assume that the community is composed of perverts. Imagine a parent wanting to check out the collab for their kids and seeing comments talking about breasts. It's like if Taylor Swift did a collab with McDonald's and all the comments were talking about her thighs or whatever. Really poor optics for the community as a whole.",

If you are in the fandom for hours every day, reading every tweet the talents post, and watching every stream, you'll probably know that it's overdone and that the talent is tired of the jokes. But if you are just occasionally active for a few minutes per week getting your content from trending posts, memes, and clips (which probably makes up the majority of people based on livestream viewers vs subs), you'll just see just a few of the jokes, and none of the negative feedback towards them. So they repeat those, not knowing that they are just one of many thousands doing it and not knowing that the people involved might not like it.\n\nI don't think people are being malicious or anything, they are just acting on the limited information that they see. Watching streams, following all the news, and watching their social media is a big time commitment, one that even I'm not always able to do. So let's be forgiving towards people who can't keep up, and offer gentle feedback to people who don't know better, rather than aggressive responses.",
