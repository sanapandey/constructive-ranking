Clearly she doesn\u2019t want to go down that road just would like people to stop on the joke especially when it comes to her professional work setting.

I've witnessed many times where the community is uniquely acquiescent to direct requests from the talents, the only exception being Mococo's nicknames. When Kiara calmly but firmly told fans she didn't like the Bottom Left meme, the fans very quickly stoped. When Towa talked about TMT on Kiara's show and how she didn't particularly like it, the fans stopped using it for the most part. When Fubuki talked about how the \"she's actually a cat\" meme got in the way of her helping a fanartist, the community largely stopped using the meme.\n\n\nI certainly understand being frustrated that it has to be said at all but I feel like portraying the community as insufferable about it is a disservice to how responsive it is to the talents requests.

While the vitriol of fans reacting to Mococo is fairly unique, the substance of their actions isn't. For every bottom left or Subway, there are... Suisei does not like being called flat, Subaru is not a duck, Kanata is not a gorilla, Zeta is not a cat, Niko does not like being called a cat, Kaela does not like being called cute, Roboco and Miko do not like being called clumsy. Almost every single one of these things is so incredibly prevalent that the crowd at FES actively rebelled against the talents' call and responses without any kind of prompting. That's insane! What fans often interpret as playful teasing isn't, and just because the other girls or Cover management play along doesn't mean we should.

            "body": "Also reminder that Kiara asked Towa-sama how she feels about being called \"TMT\" (Towa Maji Tenshi), and she answered that she hates that word, and gave up in saying she's not TMT everytime people say it. To this day I see chat going TMT everytime she gets mentioned on any stream\n\n\nI think a big reason why this happen is because back in the day, before EN was big or existed at all, holoJP was going viral constantly in the west. But after that, you don't see their translated clips getting popular, so people only know them for 5 year old memes that stuck with the community and kept repeting it. It's not that they don't have cool moments and clips, it's just that they don't go viral anymore. I think some of the jokes are fine if the talent doesn't mind, but something like flat jokes probably gets old and uncomfortable after so long",
