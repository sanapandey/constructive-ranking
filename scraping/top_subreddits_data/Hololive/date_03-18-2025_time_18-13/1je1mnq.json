Her concert director told her that Sora has a different aura to her that has the ability to draw people in and that she is the best at making the people who are watching fall for her when she performs on stage. \n\nBut if you don't believe him and think he is biased look no further than [Suisei ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HG86Y5t19Y)who straight up just gasses up Sora's Fes performance event calling Sora the Final Boss, and saying that only Sora can elevate a song that on a technical level is lower on the emotional scale, to go above and beyond and make you feel the Orthodox  Idol energy. \n\nSo if you haven't seen Sora perform on stage yet, I highly recommend giving it a look and Join us\n\nBecome one with the Soratomo (\u0e51\u2579\u11ba\u2579\u0e51)\u306c\u3093\u306c\u3093",

In fact, she has the opposite. She commands our attention unwittingly with her warm and gentle tone.\n\nTo give a personal example, her performance of Lucky Seventh Whistle got me tearing up immediately. That is thanks to how she brought the lyrics of the song to life with her vocals and the energy she gave to the choreography.\n\nThe choreography was pretty simple compared to her other songs (not helped by the fact she was singing in the center stage) and the lyrics of the song are admittedly kinda basic in terms of depth. The only factors that add depth to the lyrics are the clever marriage wordplays that were also interwoven in the choreography and the background of the song which is the fact that it is a celebratory song for her 7th Anniversary.\n\nBut her performance of this song in 6th Fes despite these limitations was just beyond phenomenal. She gave so much life and soul to the lyrics and choreography that you really feel she means every word sung in the song and action she does in the choreography. She is truly an idol like no other. A star that only appears once in a lifetime.",
