Its always tied to a promotion, you no longer get significant pay increases over time for just being good at your job. Which makes people move from company to company looking for higher pay instead of sticking around and just negotiating for a raise.\n\nAlthough I don't think pay is usually the main factor behind members leaving, I don't know their numbers maybe the cut is bigger doing it solo after leaving.",

Shion's streams, songs, or appearances are events that people look forward to. \n\nFor some people, that's invigorating; being known, having people be excited to hear what you say and eagerly await what you're going to do is a boost to their esteem. For others, its stressful. People are watching you, thinking about you, worrying about you. They're talking about you, criticizing you, praising you, fighting over you, scrutinizing you and your relationships and your work. It can be... a lot. Especially if you didn't sign up for that, but instead joined a strange company where you'd be an anime girl on the internet for like maybe 100 people to really care about.\n\n\"Company Direction\" isn't just workload or staff or management decisions. It's that Hololive is an internationally recognized brand that wants to expand and cement that recognition now, when she joined a company that'd be happy if they managed to get a local audience and develop tech that could have more applications than just anime girl embodiment. They put on major shows, work with major labels and studios, have placements in massive games. If you've got problems with stress... it's not a job that you know you can show up to and nobody will care what you do.",

I even bought Shion's membership just to check her last membership stream to confirm it.\n\nAs for her graduation announcement, she did not mention work in any part of the stream at all. I rechecked a few times already, I even translated most of it.\n\nThe story starting from how Shion says other ppl don't consider streaming a job is false, she never even said that. In her membership (I really don't want to reveal membership stuff, but the misinformation is just ridiculous):\n\nShion bought new streaming equipment, her mic. What happened was chat suggested ASMR for what she can do with her new and amazing mic, she said her reason to not do ASMR is just cause doesn't want to do it. From there, it goes to Shion saying she wants to do what she wants to do, and what she wants to so is what she's doing now (stream). (TL note: She's trying to phrase her thoughts well, finding the right words to get acroess her meaning)\n\nPeople call it work, but for her, if that's what they call it, then it shouldn't be called work. She wants to do what she wants, but work is something that has things that ppl don't want to do, for Shion, her streaming and internet activities, it's fine to not call them work. She jokes it's completely fine to call her a NEET, she'd prefer if you called her a NEET if that's how you think of her streaming and internet activities.\n\nObviously, work has a lot of things you don't want to do. Some ppl would consider streaming and such activities a job, but Shion says it's fine to not consider this a job and her a NEET that doesn't do anything/work. But then those ppl would reply with \"But aren't you doing it?\", which Shion laughs at. There are some ppl who says that.\n\n**\"If you think of it as work, it won't be fun anymore\"**, Shion basically doesn't consider streaming as work.\n\nShe then says she's not bothered by it at all, for such ppl who think like that, she wonders if they'd accept that she's not working. There are some moments where she thinks of what she's doing as a job, like when she's at the studio doing recordings, they'd ask her to voice some lines. But when she in her normal streams, playing the games she wants to play, she doesn't consider those as work.\n\nThen she asks 'What is work? She wonders if you're making money, then maybe that is considered a job. There are many ways interpret 'work' as Shion comes to this conclusion.\n\n**BASICALLY, this part of her mengen was her discussing work and what it means to her, it's just a random topic. She's joking about being telling others that she's a NEET, everything OP said about Shion wanting to work, how she can't bring up she's a Vtuber is nonsense!**",

Being able to properly promote a sponsorship that comes your way.\n\nSame with trying to find a apartment. Do land lords in Japan want to know what you do for your company? Or do they only really care they have a job that they can afford rent?",

Even landlords in America want to know your job so they can make guesses as to how stable your income is and if you're going to be using the property as part of your work.  I imagine Japanese laws let landlords be even more judgy of your income sources.",

Just the streaming alone is a job and many of them do idol activities on the side. I am not surprised at all how many of them wind up having health problems, especially given how few of them take any form of regular break (understably though: a break in the content creation sphere is death by algorithm suicide)",

            "body": "With the amount of graduations quoting \"differences in company direction\", the type of people that have left, as well as all the sololives, big collabs and big events that happened this past year.. I feel like even the most casual holofan should finally have enough information to conclude what the current \"company direction\" is.\n\nAqua said it best when she was leaving. If you're ambitious, driven and hungry to do bigger and better things, Hololive is the _perfect_ environment for you. This is exemplified by Suisei reaching the Budoukan stage - one of the pinnacles and dream stages of most performers in Japan - and then setting her sights even higher, wanting to do even bigger and better.\n\nHololive is filled with talents that have this kind of ambition. Even if you're perceived as bad at something you're passionate about, you can still work hard so that you can overcome that perception and succeed (e.g. Noel releasing her own album, Miko doing a sololive etc.). As the company grows bigger with each year, the ambitions of most of the talents also grows in turn. Fubuki, Miko, Marine etc. all had sololives recently, Suisei had a whole country tour performance, not to mention all the collaborations, voice recordings etc. they do with other brands.\n\nAnd hell, it's not always about idol activites, singing and dancing either. Holo minecraft was restarted and junior members like Vivi are making a name for themselves with the amount of hours they're putting into it. Botan's tournaments and ramen-related collabs were quite a hit as well. As well as Towa, Matsuri, Laplus etc. being a constant presence in FPS and esports related tournaments. The common point is that the talent is passionate about something, and get a ton of satisfaction by indulging in their passion while improving themselves. Breaks are plentiful as well, so those who want to rest for a while or those who fear burnout are always welcome to pause for a bit, but once you're recharged, you will certainly want to get back to whatever it is you were chasing. That's the sort of environment Hololive fosters.\n\nAnd of course such an environment might not be suited for people who want to go at a more sedate pace. People who want more of a small-scale, comfortable vibe.. people who just want to chill. But at the end of the day, it also depends on how much a talent is influenced by their environment. There are plenty of talents who seem fine chilling in their own corner after all (e.g. Korone, Gura etc.) - but it's not a coincidence that these same talents are the ones about whom the most \"graduation rumors\" are spread. I'm sure it's quite awkward for a talent when they alone are absent from certain big events, collabs etc. which are becoming more and more frequent. Not to mention both fans (and gleeful dramamongers) will notice their absences from such events, and spin their own narratives about it. You'd need to have a certain level of mental fortitude to ignore all the bullshit said about you by people who couldn't care less, which is not something that can be taken for granted.\n\nAs Bae said, change is good. It means that you aren't stagnant, that you are improving, becoming a better version of yourself. But doing that in front of a screen, under the microscopic scrutiny of fans, antis, dramamongers and the general internet audience.. that's certainly not something that every person in the world is comfortable doing, especially for such a long time. While Hololive had humble beginnings and a more chill atmosphere early on, both the company and most of the talents themselves are constantly aiming for bigger and better things, and I'm sure that some talents have limits to their ambition, endurance in chasing their passions in such a continuous way, or the mental fortitude required for being in that constant spotlight.\n\nThe mantra for fans remains the same as always : Support your oshi while you still can, correct misinformation, ignore stupid narratives and listen to the talents when they talk about their own lives, environment and circumstances.\n\nI wish Shion the best in whatever her future endeavors may be.",

As I mentioned, it really comes down to how each individual talent is affected by their environment. Some will see their peers working hard for their passions and may feel negative thoughts about their own perceived lack of effort. But there will also be those who are less susceptible to peer pressure and are content with going at their own pace in their own corner.\n\nThis is why comparison between talents is _heavily_ discouraged in the fandom. Even if they can shut out the words of antis and dranamongers, comparisons from their own fans are not so easily dismissed.\n\nSupport your oshi, let her do activities at a pace comfortable for her. Comments like \"I wish my oshi streamed/performed/collabed as much as X\" would hurt a lot coming from one's own fans.",

Shion was even worse, since she's recruited in Hololive back when she's still a teenager (Note for tourist, this practice is common in entertainment industry, especially Japan).   \n  \nTho, I DO wonder if there's anything that can be done about that. Because from the words of other talents, they have a lot of say in their own workload, and it's not like Cover is trying to squeeze them or anything. Hell, even HoloFES is optional. So my guess is something outside of Hololive/Cover that cause this to happen. If that's the case, Idk there's anything that can be done for her.",

I surmised that perhaps she couldn't handle where the company ended up/realized it wasn't what she wanted, understood that they *would* cut her as much a slack she needed, but none-the-less that wasn't a tenable position for her as she'd beat herself up over not doing things that she thought she should be doing as a Holo member. I felt like it was probably why Chloe kept putting stuff on her plate even though it was detrimental to her health and the only way to get herself in a healthy position was to just cut entirely. \n\nThat being said in the end we really won't get too much in the way of details. I'll just say that despite disagreements in direction it's not like they're exiting and making scathing, veiled commentary at the group unlike what we saw in their competitor company.

All four of them are somehow still very active and not appearing to have plans to graduate anytime soon, despite their environment and function changing dramatically.\n\nI'm honestly shocked that a lot of the old guard is still chugging along despite the massive changes the company had over the years. It's far from free money as well. Content creators have been burning out left and right and those have only the streaming/video creation/PR side to worry about, not the additional physical and vocal practice, corpo stuff, the detriments associated with idol culture, etc. \n\nFor some it worked out really well. Sora got essentially everything she ever dreamed of out of it and people like Subaru turned out to be an insane lucky draw. Life moves on regardless. Crazy, that the rate of graduation only just picked up last year. \n\nI hope Shion takes her time and really focuses on her mental health, I'm sure not having to be permanently online as a job can help a lot in this regard.

Thus why I felt the need to post about the non-Affiliate situation. I had reached similar conclusions about Fauna after eliminating a number of other possibilities. Basically, my reason for positing it was that I was and still am pretty sure that Shion not taking Affiliate status was actually not a personal thing or something done out of resentment, and I think that's rather relevant to all this. At the very least, I'd put it forth that any such conclusion that she had negative reasons for not taking Affiliate status is extremely premature.\n\nFolks probably don't wanna get into that aspect of things at all at this point though, so I'm probably deleting the original post.",

Cover can't continue to grow with a outdated model solely based on streaming. That's why they're going cross-media, why do you think we have so many concerts, events, collaborations with big companies, HoloIndie for games, several manga series and so on? \n\nThat's the change they're going, there are plenty of Yagoo interviews on the subject, as well as financial reports that speak explicitly of their new direction (but I guess you weren't willing to do your own research). That's mean more projects, more opportunities which means inevitably more work, more red tape and rules to go through => more stress and fatigue, more frustration. Obviously some talents will handle that better than others, some won't be on board with this direction and then leave.\n\nI know that nuance is a difficult thing to grasp for many people, but no sometimes a difference of opinion/direction is literally just that, and any departure doesn't means there's something rotten behind the scenes.
