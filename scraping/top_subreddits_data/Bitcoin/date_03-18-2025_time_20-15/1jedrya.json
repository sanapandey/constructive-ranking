But they're not because most people are being quite, thus the older adresses are growing.\n\nAlso newer address spike when there's a pump because it's a sign of increased liquidity. They go DOWN during sideways movement when little is happening. So all this shows is a lagging indicator that we've been in a consolidation period.\u00a0\n\n\nYou cannot use this graph to predict a pump, you can only use it to tell you that you are in one. But at that the price is always a better indicator, because duh\n\n\nPeople love to use lagging indicators to try to predict the future. But you just cant, unfortunately\u00a0",
