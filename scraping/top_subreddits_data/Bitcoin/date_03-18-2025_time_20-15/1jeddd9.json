    "selftext": "If I could borrow ~10 minutes of your time. If you are new to Bitcoin especially, I think you need to have a long term view on things and set a goal of stacking a block reward. This is different for all of us and how much money we have to convert into BTC. But my advice for young investors eager to get rich quick, wishing you had 3 Bitcoin today. 0.19 BTC in 2040 will be like 3 Bitcoin today. I know you want that new lambo and to get that new girl, but as you grow up your wants will change and you will want to see your kids have a bright orange future. By the time they are grown up 0.006 will be like 3 Bitcoin today. You aren\u2019t to late to Bitcoin you are just in time.\nSo start stacking toward a block reward today.\n",
