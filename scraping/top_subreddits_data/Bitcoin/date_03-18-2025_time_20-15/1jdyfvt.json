Do I just make sure to download my transaction log every year and use those on my eventual tax return in ~10 years (if the tax return website asks me to upload documents as proof)?\n\nAnd then...I just remembered that earlier this year I bought and sold some Litecoin. That is considered separate from my plans to long-term hodl BTC, right? As in, I take care of that on my next tax return, and don't mention my BTC on that one yet (since I plan on holding it for a long time)?\n\nI just wanna make sure because the site I used to do my taxes changed the crypto part from two years ago when it made me separate all the different cryptos and made me upload documents as proof, to this past one where it had a more general crypto part where I just put all my crypto numbers in and it didn't require any uploads (and both years were over the $600).",

Might not mean a lot to you but there are hundreds of millions of people that are unbanked (eg, lower casts in India), those people can still use bitcoin. \n\nAnd bitcoin is designed to be perfect money, and part of that is divisibility. One bitcoin can be divided into 100 million satoshi. So yes, 21 million bitcoin is PLENTY to work as money, and it is NOT SET IN STONE and changes can be made to bitcoin eg, even if only one bitcoin were left, it could be made so much more divisible that bitcoin could still function properly as money with only one bitcoin left.\n\nAs for the volatility, yes it is a problem (for some) to use as a store of value, or money.
