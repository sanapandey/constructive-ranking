The expense of war is not restricted to the \nannual budgetary costs of the war spending itself, but also depends upon the way in which war is \nfinanced. When war is financed through debt, the costs are much greater than when it is financed \nthrough taxation or other revenues, since interest payments must be made as long as the debt is \noutstanding. In fact, interest payments can sometimes grow to beyond the level of the debt itself, as \nwill likely be the case with the post-9/11 wars. \n\nIf war spending ceased immediately, interest payments on the $2 trillion of existing war debt would rise \nto over $2 trillion by 2030 and to $6.5 trillion by 2050. These interest payments will grow larger as the \nU.S. continues its post-9/11 military interventions and continues amassing debt to pay for the costs of \nwar.\"\n\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/1-trillion-impact-what-easing-debt-brake-means-for-germany/a-71949959\n\n... Far-reaching financial\u00a0consequences\u00a0\n\nEconomists warn of serious consequences on the financial markets if Germany were to incur almost \u20ac1 trillion in new debt. Lars Feld, professor at the Walter Eucken Institute in Freiburg, expects Germany's national debt to increase from its current level of around 62% to 90% of annual economic output over the next ten years.\n\nThis would result in an additional interest expenditure of between \u20ac250 and \u20ac400 billion, depending on the development of the interest rate for state bonds, Feld said at a budget committee hearing in the Bundestag. The international bond markets had already become nervous.\n\nVeronika Grimm, Professor at the Technical University of Nuremberg, sees a \"challenge for stability in Europe,\" as she put it in front of the Budget Committee. If interest rates for German government bonds rise, this will cause interest rates for already highly indebted countries such as Italy and Spain to rise to levels\u00a0these countries can hardly manage.\n\nGrimm warned that this would once again increase \"vulnerability in the eurozone.\"",
