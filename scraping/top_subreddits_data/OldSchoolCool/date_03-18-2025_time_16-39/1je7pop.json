I try to put myself in the mind of a 1979 audience watching that movie - which is SO hard because Sigourney has become SO entwined with the legacy of that franchise - and she\u2019s just an unassuming final girl.\n\nBy the time she is back for Aliens, she is a movie star, whose famous for having a badass role taking down aliens, and that\u2019s become her image, but in Alien she\u2019s kind of just a normal tall lady on the crew. It rocks, it\u2019s part of why both that first movie rocks so hard and why Sigourney is such a cool as hell movie star.",
