(With regards to Donald 'Duck' Dunn, Willie Hall, and Jake & Elwood)\n\nFun fact: I went to see Jackson Browne not too long ago, and his sax player was - Blue Lou!!!

Most people perceive it as magical and broadening, they feel like they hadn't yet experienced all of reality so they begin to question what else they had a limited view on. That is where most people see lasting change, they begin to question everything, social structures, religious, legal, health, nature.. you pretty much allow yourself to explore new ideas after the fact. It's funny, the government wanted to use it as mind control drugs, but it really just helps you deprogram your world view and build a new one.",
