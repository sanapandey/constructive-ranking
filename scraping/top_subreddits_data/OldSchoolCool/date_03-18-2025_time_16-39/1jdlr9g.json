            "body": "Mr. Rogers is many peoples' first and sometimes deepest para-social relationships. He presented a face on television of unconditional love and acceptance. By all accounts I'm familiar with, this wasn't an act--he really did believe children should be loved unconditionally and guided gently.\n\n\nOf course, images like this bring to mind the he was more than his neighborhood of make believe. He has a wife and kids, and his kids sometimes needed firmer guidance than his television personality would suggest was possible. He had challenges in being a parent, to strike the right balance of freedom and restrictions, between correcting a mistake and overzealous punishment, etc. From what I have read, he wasn't always the Mr. Rogers from TV. But that's okay too, I think. He may be an ideal, even if he himself couldn't be that ideal every day.",

And it really seemed to come from a place of humility rather than low-self-esteem or toxic perfectionism. Blows my mind.",
