But when I picked her I left behind probably 10 dogs who ALSO would have been amazing pets. \n\nSo yes, mutts are amazing and I've had them since I was a child. But we don't need to create them on purpose!!!  They will happen anyway. People like OP who likely is a backyard breeder make me insane. Because unless they handpick and screen new owners for each puppy, take back any dog they have sold or adopted out (any time- even if it's when the dog is an adult!), and gotten vet care for each puppy THEY ARE THE PROBLEM.",

My comment is based on a common sense approach from what I was taught as a child in school. However, I suspect there is plenty out there as it is so widely accepted that it forms part of the biology curriculum in a standard education. Learning about how genes are inherited and recessive genes is what I'd imagine is the first introduction to genetics most people have. Also it's common knowledge of the problems incest creates and why.\n\nGiven that it's common knowledge, I don't feel the onus is on me to provide resources and that's something you should be capable of.\n\nBut I did anyway. Please bear in mind I've not got hours of time to dedicate to your question, but these could help if your wish is to research further and not simply an attempt at a 'gotcha!'.\n\n\n[Large-Scale Polymorphism Analysis of Dog Leukocyte Antigen Class I and Class II Genes and Comparison of the Haplotype Diversity between Breeds in Japan](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10001263/)\n\nA bit more reader friendly:\n\n[Investigating the relationship between inbreeding and life expectancy in dogs: mongrels live longer than pure breeds](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10362839/)\n\nI also thought this was a great, balanced article and advocates for safer pedigree breeding:\n\n[The health of pedigree and mongrel dogs](https://www.ourdogs.co.uk/News/2002/March2002/News010302/thehealth.htm)",

With most whoopsie litters, \u201cselfrescued\u201d and \u201cjust the once\u201d litters, the owners just give out the puppies, there are no contracts, likely no follow ups, and the puppies tend to end up having litters when matured, either still in the owners care or due to becoming stray. Its partially because people who support backyard breeding don\u2019t see the problem with it, and tend to not prevent unnecessary reproduction.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cbdincyl3hpe1.jpeg?width=1134&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aaed6c26f67a10d7914a8e432d01913e83d81e8a",

Although that jump, that most people would make, speaks volumes and may spark a conversation on nurture vs nature. That said, most places consider Shepards, huskies, chow chows, dobermans, etc  as high risk in addition to Pit Bulls. But Pit bulls do tend to spend longer amounts of time in shelters than other breeds leading to a buildup.* But maybe that is a partial reason itself for high shelter populations.\n\nPerhaps a stronger push to require people to register their pets with incentives to spay and neuter would be a solution, or help at the very least.\n\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6107223/#sec012",

You should do it because you want the puppies.  If you don't want puppies, then don't create puppies.\n\nOr even if you do want a puppy, maybe get a rescue instead of breeding, but go ahead and get yourself a puppy.",

Almost every Christian/catholic country does. 5.5 billion people have access to the internet, yet still we have countries with animal issues. So clearly it's not about that at all\n\nAnyways. As I said. You are actually doing a DETRIMENT to your cause by attempting to educate others in the way you do. It completely undermines the actual attempts of educated, compassionate, and respectful people\n\nI hope your day gets better and you stop projecting your own issues onto others and fix the way you speak to people\n\nFailing to admit any of this is genuinely being more stupid than the others here. Because you claim to know better\n\nPs. You're refusing to learn by trying to rationalize your own behavior. Go take an education course.

If you\u2019re in the US dog abortion is not really an option for as the medicine is no longer available due to safety issues. Only thing that could be available is an estradiol cypionate (ECP), which needs to be used immediately while the dog is still in heat to prevent fertilized eggs from implanting, but is not recommended by vets as it can cause pyometra and severe anemia. Risks are high and it may not work so vets normally do not carry the drug. There is also Protaglandin which can cost up to $2,000 and requires 4-7 days of hospitalization due to the risks. If that is something you would want to do you for your pregnant dog you have to have the pregnancy confirmed at 4 weeks at the vet and it cannot be done if the puppy has been pregnant for 40 days.",

And, tbh, I think it\u2019d be much better to adopt from a shelter if I ever get a dog on my own because I\u2019d get to skip the crazy puppy years LOL. There definitely needs to be more education and awareness of what happens to dogs at shelters.

They want a puppy they can grow with and mould from day one. Many dogs at shelters are there because of behavioural issues that many don't have the time, knowledge or resources to facilitate.\n\nAlso, at least in the UK, the criteria for adopting a dog from a shelter is very high, where it's almost ridiculous. Good luck being approved to adopt if you have: children, other animals, no large garden space, a full-time job, live too far from the shelter, lower income, an apartment, don't want to wait months/years on a waiting list and more.\n\nIn Germany, spaying a dog without a medical reason is discouraged and could be illegal under their animal welfare laws.\n\nThere may be solutions to this but it lies at the level of government policy, not shaming others on Reddit. I think that energy is best directed elsewhere, it makes no difference here.",
