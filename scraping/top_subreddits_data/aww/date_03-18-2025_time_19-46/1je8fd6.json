We've had her a bit over 13 years, adopted fully grown; the shelter estimated she was 3 at that time but given how old that would make her I'm guessing that wasn't quite right. She started life raiding countryside chicken coops as a feral dog until she was captured and quickly adapted to a life of comfort. That said she's still very much at home in her woods and I'm lucky to still have her as my hiking companion after all this time.",
