He waited by the door and followed me everywhere. He was my buddy. But I couldn't bring hi into my home.\n\nSo I took the chance and caged him and took him to the the vet to get him neutered. He was so traumatized, he peed on himself on the drive home. I seriously thought he'd flee and never come back.\n\nWhen I opened the carrier, he ran, full speed to the back yard gate. Then he stopoed, ran back to me, put both front paws on my leg, and then ran and hid for a day. It was like he said, \"That sucked, but you and me, we're still good.\"\n\nHe's since been adopted and gets to be the 24/7 indoor cat he always wanted to be, but I miss my buddy, sometimes.",
