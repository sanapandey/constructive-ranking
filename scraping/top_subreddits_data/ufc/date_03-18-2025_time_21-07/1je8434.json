I also think Jon\u2019s the greatest fighter with a shit load of asterisks.\n\nTom has defended his belt a belt that should be unified after one fight. There\u2019s absolutely no sense in taking another fight because either Jon is  gonna have to fight him or vacate the belt that he already earned previously in fights.",

From a business perspective of course Dana is looking after his golden pony, another fact is Tom has had a serious injury before, how do we know he won\u2019t beat or lose to Jones then hurt himself again?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of variables but the bottom line is he\u2019s wasting time playing Jon\u2019s game. If Jon says no again or opts out he needs to move on with his life like he was about to in that video he made earlier this week.\n\nLuckily Jones says he\u2019ll fight now and wants 6 months, that means we have nothing to complain about now. Time to wait until fight week",

It's the inflamation around the bone anchors where the tendon is reattached that take all the time and work to rehab.  \n  \nI tore my pec completely from a bench press accident, I am on PEDs, and it still took a loooooong time to be functional again.

Jon arguably lost a few fights tho, and then the roids and eye pokes bring him down in my opinion.  I think he intentionally used eye pokes throughout his career.  We can blame the refs for not taking points, but I can\u2019t blame anyone but Jon for failing multiple ped tests.

Just because he won the rematches doesn't magically make his record perfect. I never understand this argument from GSP stans.\n\nAlso, to argue that GSP's record is perfect and Jones' isn't is kinda hilarious. Jones has a DQ against Hamill which was all sorts of fucky. Worst ref in the business, Steve Mazagatti, should've ended that fight long before the elbows were thrown. Then he asks a DEAF fighter what's wrong and doesn't understand the issue, just that Hamill is unable to continue. The injury that caused Hamill to be unable to continue was from a legal takedown, nothing to do with the elbows. And those elbows are legal now.",

The biggest strike against GSP for me is that he tapped to strikes against Matt Serra. That loss is just awful, like if Jones had gotten stopped by Matyushenko in his run. GSP fought during an era that had notoriously lax testing. He also had HGH gut and super sus traps.\n\nBut, to be perfectly clear, IDGAF about PEDs. All top athletes are taking them, anyone that thinks otherwise is delusional. Jones also dominated other juicers, so it ain't the PEDs that make him the GOAT.\n\nKhabib doesn't belong in the GOAT convo at all, he didn't accomplish enough despite being extremely dominant. Most of his undefeated record was against dudes in Russia that don't even have Wiki pages. I believe he even has a comically low amount of top 10 wins for any person brought up in the GOAT convo, but I don't care enough to check what it is.",

Let's you diet and organize a fight camp and have a full camp against a specific opponent along with any travel. Six months is longer than it takes to prepare, but it's not like they compete on a regular schedule and have consistent income. They have other shit going on in their lives. Other obligations and responsibilities that they can't just drop over night to disappear for months. Having an extra 3 months to wrap up other projects, business dealings, family obligations, etc is perfectly reasonable for somebody that doesn't need to be doing this to survive anymore and can just as easily retire with the belt and goat status.\u00a0",

Many, many, many athletes are on something. From Olympians down to amateurs. I don't agree with it, especially in combat sports, but it's not a reason for me to write off his entire career.\n\nAnd finally, the ducking accusations. Jones has been pretty clear with his intentions since leaving LHW. He knows he has cemented his legacy and he wants to get paid on his way out. He put out his number, it's on the UFC to make it happen. He can walk away if they don't want to play ball. They could strip him and promote Aspinal if they don't want to play ball.
