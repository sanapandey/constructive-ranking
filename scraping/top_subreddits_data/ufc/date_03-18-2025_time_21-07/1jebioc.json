I'm not saying either of them are good people or even that they aren't capable of the crimes that they have been accused of (Connor especially), but we as a society need to stop being so blind when it comes to these high profile, multi-millionaires being accused of rape when they are the people with the least incentive to rape somebody while also having the most to lose.",

There should be stricter controls and more powers to deport immigrants.\nThe issue of welfare abuse is actually rampant among all ethnic groups in the u.k not just immigrants.\n\nThe issues with Sweden, Germany are a certain group of people who do not want to integrate. When you have cultures that can cohabit and adhere to our way of life then it\u2019s not a problem.\nI\u2019m half Indian and half English. None of my Indian family speak Indian and are more Anglicanised then other groups.  We are Christian, are well educated and align more with English ideals then others.\n\nI also think cultures matter. For  e.g Pakistanis have a higher crime rate, more welfare claims and  are less willing to integrate into British society. Indians are the polar opposite.  We pay more in tax, have lower crime rates, less single parent households, more educated etc then English white people.",

The idea that all 12 jury members went in without any prejudice, when the vast majority of the country holds such prejudices against him is insane(im not saying that such prejudice against Conor is unjustified, given his previous behaviour and associations with the Kinehans). The only thing worse is the idea that civil suits on certain matters must be heard in front of a jury, when their is no presumption of innocence. Personally, I dont think you should be able to take a civil case for compensation on any matter specifically covered by criminal law, without a preexisting conviction under said criminal law. Im not making any judgement on the facts of this particular case, but neither can anybody else because the process is such a joke, it effectively makes the whole thing a kangaroo court",

Sure its increasing  due to scumbags like mcgregor  who add to it\n\nWill you admit that as well?
