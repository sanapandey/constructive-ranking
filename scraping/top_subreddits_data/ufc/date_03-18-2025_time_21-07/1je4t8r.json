He shot for TD's in every fight except Oliviera he just can't get them and gassed himself out and became a punching bag. I like the taunting but he only does it when he's taking a beating and out of ideas. \n\nTough as nails and can possibly knock anyone out in the first round but the Gaethje an poirier fights were exciting in spite him. He'd have grappled to a win if he was able to (Rd 2 vs Poirier). He does go for the finish tbf. He shot for like 20 takedowns vs Alvarez, he just can't do that now he's older and not as juiced up.",
