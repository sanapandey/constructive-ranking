Giving gaenthje his 3rd title shot after beating 11th ranked fiziev on short notice who was on a 2 fight losing streak in a close fight makes little sense if we\u2019re going off of merit. Especially considering gaethje just got dominated by max who illia just kod. The only people who complain about islam beating featherweights are Dagestani haters who will always discredit islam. Illia is the 3rd (should be 2nd) pfp fighter who is the only person outside of arman who actually has a good chance of beating islam and we\u2019re seriously fucking around talking about a justing gaenthje fight when islam is about to move up to WW. Arman would be a fine fight to make tho",

Ilia is obviously much shorter so he is more compact. But Ilia's ability to generate KO power with technique is ELITE. He doesn't throw with his whole body or swing wildly, but he still puts people COMPLETELY to sleep.\n\nThey're different, but my point was just that for their respective weight classes, Ilia has more power. Ilia can put any FW-LW and prob even WWs to sleep. Alex can KO anyone but it's not that 1 punch KO power like Ilia.",

I think Holloway, despite losing his last fight vs Ilia, is an interesting match up. I'd even be more interested in seeing a 3rd fight vs Volkanovski with a full camp despite him suffering back to back KOs vs Islam & Ilia. \n\nThat obviously depends on how Volkanovski looks vs Diego Lopes and if he wins, but a trilogy would be more interesting than Gaethje.",

I\u2019m saying there\u2019s a reason you don\u2019t see many 5\u20197 guys dominate the lightweight division.  They are smaller.  It\u2019s not rocket science.  Besides Tsarukyan at 5\u20197, the rest of the guys in the top 7 are bigger guys.  \n\nI\u2019m not a UFC super fan so I\u2019ll gladly surrender my point if you can find me some 5\u20197 guys who dominated the top guys in the LW division.  I\u2019m guessing there aren\u2019t many.  I wonder why that is?",
