She also claimed he said \"ill show you what it feels like to tap\" while supposedly choking her. Like there's a lot of good reason to doubt her as well. \n\nGuys like Connor are easy fucking targets because of their garbage personas, doesn't make them a rapist. The amount of athletes that get baited into this shit its like daily my guy. \n\nIf he raped her and there was solid evidence, fine go castrate and send to jail forever. But all evidence pointed to her story being bullshit, and pretty much would've been tossed out in a criminal court. They did the smart thing to get money off him.\n\nHe's a piece of shit but rapists are fucking scum, even worse than Connor.

Ilia could be a great win, Max would be a good win, Justin+Arman 2 since the arman win was so long ago would be great on his record for saying he completely cleared out the current division. There\u2019s still more great wins for Islam to get, specifically Arman 2 and Ilia, probably Justin as well just to finish off the division for good. Also Islam has a more diverse record in terms of how he\u2019s won fights as well, he\u2019s just more well rounded. \n\nSo if he wins vs Ilia and Arman (2)+ maybe Justin and then moves up to WW to fight for double champ status and wins that belt, that\u2019s absolutely more than Khabib did at least without requiring Connor. We\u2019ll see what happens but the fact Islam is still going means we\u2019re not comparing full pictures here.",

The amount of ways he\u2019s won via submission is absolutely insane, I believe he has the most diverse submission win record in the ufc and quite a few of them are very rare to see and difficult to pull off. Some of them against the best in his division. In order to do that, you need to be dominant. \n\nThe only reason fights go on longer with him is largely because he likes to strike and he tests his striking against the strikers/boxers he faces like Dustin. Dustin improved his defense on the ground so much and he still couldn\u2019t fend off Islam once it went to the ground, and it usually goes to the ground whenever Islam is ready for it. He is extremely dominant, he just doesn\u2019t use his strongest asset against non wrestlers immediately like Khabib did, mostly because Islams striking is better than Khabibs and he likes to use it. Otherwise every fight would be on the ground in round 1 or early 2 and he also knows that\u2019d be boring as hell, ie the moicano fight.",

He has insane grip strength. When it comes to the ground game though, Khabib has the advantage. We saw Dustin struggle more with Khabib than he did with Islam on the ground and Dustin was a BJJ Blackbelt even back then. Plus Khabib wouldn't have had nearly as hard of a time with Volkanovski as Islam did. Volkanovski was actually able to defend takedowns from Islam as a Featherweight. Khabib would've ran him over.",
