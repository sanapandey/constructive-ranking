The album Planet Fame, produced by Moe Berg and Garth Richardson, followed on February 14, 2002. It was filled with glam rock tracks, led by the single \u201cSo Sick of You\u201d.

The 2005 album was named Instant Classic, and was produced by Bob Ezrin along with Garth Richardson. For this release the band\u2019s name was shortened to just Robin Black. They toured extensively for this release, including internationally.\nFrontman Robin also made an appearance on Showcase\u2019s TV series KinK.
