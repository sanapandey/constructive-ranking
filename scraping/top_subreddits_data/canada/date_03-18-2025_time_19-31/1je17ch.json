The dip is visible but it seems like every year in Feburary, there is a dip across all passenger modes. The Covid numbers look way worse, like a dimension worse. All numbers are cut in half.\n\nThe border crossings for vehicles (passenger but also trucks) have been in decline since December last year but the truck numbers still look in the normative area while the passenger vehicles might or might not, you still have to wait a couple more months to see.\n\nHowever, it still would not tell you why exactly the dip happens. It is mostly financial? Or is it mostly political?",

It's easy to avoid travelling to the US when the CAD is so low. But let's say the exchange rate was to become favourable again, would people still avoid the US or would they rush back there?

I\u2019m very outspoken about what is happening in the U.S. and I know it would be hypocritical to go, which is why this rock and hard place junction really effing sucks.",
