    "selftext": "Hello r/canada\n\nLong-time reader, first-time poster.\n\nWith Trump arbitrarily imposing tariffs on Canadian products and services, apparently as a starting point of a bigger economic war and possible annexation of Canada, now is the time for Canadians to stand together against his aggression. This post is meant to be practical, actionable ideas for all Canadians to resist Trump\u2019s tariffs. Let's send the message to Trump: if you don't want to do business with Canada, you have no business here at all.\n\nThis is also a starting point. It\u2019s unlikely that anyone will be able to do all of these things, all of the time, but the more people who do them, and the more of them we do, the bigger the impact will be. Many of the suggested Canadian alternatives are not present in every province. Please add your feedback and other ideas in the comments, and I will try to update the post.\n\nUpdate: Thanks for all the comments! Have modified the list to correct and update it. A couple of useful websites flagged by other users.\n\n* [madeinca.ca](http://madeinca.ca)\n* [european-alternatives.eu](https://european-alternatives.eu)\n\n# Don\u2019t shop at American-owned stores.\n\nNot all of the alternatives are Canadian-owned; they are simply not American. You can also just shop local, as many Canadians own non-chain businesses providing these goods and services\n\n**Retail and consumer goods**\n\n* Amazon \u2192 depends what you\u2019re buying, but there are always alternatives\n* Walmart \u2192 Loblaws, Metro, Canadian Tire, Co-op (in the west)\n* Costco \u2192 Federated Co-op, Bulk Barn (you might disagree with this; Costco is standing up to Trump, and sells many Canadian products in its stores)\n* Home Depot -> Home Hardware, Rona\n* Nike \u2192 Lululemon, Roots, Nobis, Canada Goose, Aritzia\n* Levi\u2019s \u2192 Naked & Famous\n\n**Food and beverage**\n\n* McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s, KFC, Five Guys \u2192 Harvey's, A&W Canada, Burger\u2019s Priest, Hero Certified Burgers, Mary Brown's (chicken)\n* Starbucks \u2192 Tim Hortons (though now Brazilian-owned), Second Cup, Bridgehead, Country Style, Coffee Time, Deville\n* KFC, Popeyes \u2192 your local ma and pa chicken place\n* Subway \u2192 Mr. Sub\n* Krispy Kreme \u2192 Beavertails\n* Chipotle \u2192 Freshii\n* Taco Bell \u2192 Mucho Burrito, Bar Burrito\n* Domino\u2019s, Little Caesar\u2019s \u2192 Pizza Pizza, Pizza Nova\n* Dairy Queen \u2192 Chapman\u2019s Ice Cream, Laura Secord, Kawartha Dairy\n* Denny\u2019s, IHOP \u2192 Sunset Grill, Humpty\u2019s or Cora\u2019s\n* Applebee\u2019s, Chili\u2019s \u2192 Montana\u2019s, Kelsey\u2019s\n* Olive Garden \u2192 East Side Mario\u2019s\n* Buffalo Wild Wings \u2192 St. Louis Bar & Grill\n* Outback Steakhouse, Texas Roadhouse, Ruth\u2019s Chris \u2192 The Keg, Chop, Hy\u2019s\n* P.F. Chang\u2019s \u2192 Manchu Wok or Congee Queen\n\n# Don\u2019t buy American goods.\n\nThis will be difficult, because so many of our day-to-day consumer products are owned by American companies. That said, the big Canadian grocery and drug store chains have their own-brand \u201cgeneric\u201d versions of most of these American products, which are probably cheaper than the brand-name versions. When in doubt, check the label.\n\n* Procter & Gamble (Tide, Gillette, Pampers, etc.) \u2192 Attitude, Green Beaver\n* Johnson & Johnson (Tylenol, Band-Aid, Aveeno, etc.) \u2192 Life Brand (Shoppers Drug Mart), Jamieson Vitamins, Rexall\n* Colgate-Palmolive (Colgate toothpaste, Irish Spring, Softsoap, etc.) \u2192 Green Beaver\n* Unilever (Dove, Hellmann\u2019s, etc.) \u2192 Canadian soap makers, President\u2019s Choice Mayo\n* Coca-Cola (includes Dasani, Powerade, etc.) \u2192 PC Cola, Clearly Canadian\n* PepsiCo (includes Lay\u2019s, Gatorade, Quaker, Tropicana, etc.) \u2192 Kiju, Nature\u2019s Path\n* Kraft Heinz (Kraft Dinner, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, etc.) \u2192 Lactalis (Black Diamond, Cracker Barrel), PC Mac & Cheese\n* Campbell\u2019s Soup \u2192 Habitant (by Loblaws), Baxters\n* Hershey\u2019s (Reese\u2019s, Twizzlers, etc.) \u2192 Nestl\u00e9 (Switzerland), Canadian chocolate makers (Purdy\u2019s, Laura Secord)\n* Mars (M&M\u2019s, Snickers, etc.) \u2192 Cadbury, Canadian brands like Ganong\n* Mondelez (Oreo, Ritz, Triscuit, etc.) \u2192 Dare, local bakeries\n* General Mills (Cheerios, Nature Valley, etc.) \u2192 Nature\u2019s Path (Canadian), Love Grown\n\nWorth noting (thanks commenter!) that [Well.ca](http://Well.ca) allows you filter for Canadian products\n\n# Use Canadian transportation\n\n* **Gas:** Esso, Chevron, and Shell \u2192  Petro-Canada, Husky, Irving\n* **Rides:**  Uber and Lyft \u2192 Use local taxi services (e.g., Beck Taxi, TappCar) or transit\n\n# Don\u2019t buy American services.\n\nHard to avoid some of these, but not impossible.\n\n* Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Paramount+ \u2192 Crave, CBC Gem, CBC Kids, BritBox, Mubi\n* Hollywood (Warner Bros, Universal, etc.) \u2192 try some Canadian cinema like TIFF films or the Banff Mountain Films\n* Google Drive, Dropbox \u2192 [Sync.com](http://Sync.com), Proton Drive (Swiss)\n* Twitter/X (stay away, since it\u2019s owned by Elon Musk) \u2192 Bluesky, Mastodon\n* Electronic Arts (video games) \u2192 Ubisoft Montreal\n\n# Don\u2019t buy American cars, or at least buy a car made in Canada.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously impossible to buy a car without any American parts. But, if you\u2019re buying new, at least support Canadian auto workers.\n\nNon-American cars made in Canada:\n\n* Honda CR-V\n* Toyota RAV4\n* Lexus RX\n\nForeign car companies to consider \u2014 but check if their cars are assembled in the US:\n\n* Honda & Toyota \u2013 Strong presence in Canada (CR-V, RAV4, and Lexus RX are built in Ontario).\n* Mazda, Subaru, Nissan (includes Infiniti), Hyundai (includes Genesis), Kia \u2013 Mostly Japanese or Korean, no American ownership.\n* Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo \u2013 European and not American-owned.\n\nAmerican cars assembled in Canada:\n\n* Chrysler 300\n* Dodge Charger, Dodge Challenger\n* Ford Edge, Lincoln Nautilus\n* Ram 1500\n* Ford Superduty\n* Chevrolet Silverado\n* GMC Sierra\n\nAmerican car brands to avoid (no manufacturing presence in Canada), other than the models assembled in Canada that are listed above:\n\n* Tesla - Obviously stay away from these, given Elon Musk\u2019s role enabling Trump. Consider Polestar, Hyundai, Nissan, Volkswagen or Kia instead if looking to go electric\n* Ford\n* Chevrolet\n* GMC\n* Buick\n* Cadillac\n* Dodge\n* Jeep\n* Ram\n\n# Don\u2019t go to America, but be friendly and welcoming to Americans\n\n* **Cancel any vacations in the United States.** There are plenty of things to see and do in Canada. Honestly, our dollar is likely to tank anyway, so American vacations are going to become more expensive\n* **Sell American properties.** Get your money out while you still can. If it\u2019s not Trump, then climate change will certainly destroy the value of properties in places that Canadians love to flock, including Florida, Palm Springs, and Arizona. (If extreme weather doesn\u2019t destroy your property, the inability to get insurance certainly will reduce the property\u2019s resale value!)\n* **Invite American friends and acquaintances to visit Canada.** Tourism is one Canadian export that Trump cannot put tariffs on. Foreign visitors spend their money in our country.\n* **Welcome visiting Americans with open arms.** Talk to them about how important Canada\u2019s relationship with America is, and the importance of resisting Trump\n* **Send Canadian goods to American friends and relatives as gifts**\n\n# Travel elsewhere\n\nFly on Canadian airlines\n\n* Air Canada\n* WestJet\n* Porter\n* Flair\n* Air Transat\n* Sunwing\n\nAvoid American airlines:\n\n* Delta\n* American Airlines\n* United\n* Southwest\n* JetBlue\n* Alaska\n* Hawaiian\n* Spirit\n* Frontier\n* Allegiant\n\n# What else?",

Ultimately we do need to come out the other side of this able to work with our neighbours, friends, and loved ones from the south, although there's no clarity on how long this will go on.\n\nBut Canadians have a strong history of kindness and togetherness, until someone takes advantage of that kindness. Then we plan, and act smartly and conclusively. This is that.\n\nEdit: also a reminder that these are the products that Canada is creating tariffs for (the prior topic from r/canada)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/1ig1z2h/list\\_of\\_products\\_from\\_the\\_united\\_states\\_subject/](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/1ig1z2h/list_of_products_from_the_united_states_subject/)\n\n...and a sister sub, [https://www.reddit.com/r/buycanadian](https://www.reddit.com/r/buycanadian)\n\nEdit 2: Mes amis Quebecoise, please feel free to add QC companies. Let's give Canada Post some steady work. There's plenty of maple syrup to flow around!\n\nEdit 3: there was a temporary agreement between our PM and the USA - a 30 day pause is in effect for any tariffs, the same as with Mexico-USA. Since this is technically not over and might happen again in March, we will keep this list as an announcement for some time still, since attitudes have already shifted as reality sets in. Stay kind out there, but we have now seen that everyone has limits.\n\nEdit 4: Do you influence purchasing and logistics for a Canadian company? You can have some win-win discussions,  check this out: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyCanadian/comments/1ih2crf/with\\_one\\_conversation\\_at\\_work\\_i\\_moved\\_half\\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyCanadian/comments/1ih2crf/with_one_conversation_at_work_i_moved_half_a/)\n\nAlso a giant shout-out to [www.simons.ca](http://www.simons.ca) for amazingly styled  Canadian clothes, and [www.twitter.com/dieworkwear](http://www.twitter.com/dieworkwear) for amazingly detailed style.\n\n4 March Edit 5: We are re-unlocking this thread due to the [new tariffs that have gone into play](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/1j3emnc/trudeau_announces_canadas_response_to_trump_trade/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",

Most (if not all?) Canadian public libraries are free to join as long as you are a resident of the city in question. Some will even let you join if you work or go to school in that city. Some libraries are a part of consortia, which means you often get access to the ebooks, e-audiobooks, and other digital collections from neighbouring systems. You are also fully able to hold multiple public library accounts if you have residences in multiple cities, or if you live in one but work/attend school in another. Libraries also tend not to police account sharing, so if you don't use your local library's digital content, feel free to let a friend or family member use it in your stead.

Decided to look closer and noticed it actually said \"Made with 100% Canadian mustard seeds\". I thought it was weird it said that vs made in Canada. I looked at the back label, and sure enough it says \"Imported by \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" 'whatever company' out of Ontario.\n\nI am blown away by that. Our mustard seeds are exported to the USA so the mustard can be made, where we then import it back into Canada to sell. That is madness. I know that happens in some other industries (like auto), but there is NO reason we can't produce our own mustard here, especially consider we grow so many mustard seeds. I know there are smaller companies that do, but not at the scale that French's or Heinz does. I've been buying French's for almost a decade because I thought they were Canadian (because of the maple leaf logo), but nope. American company, and not made in Canada.",

I don't know where else to post this, but I have to say it.\n\nI live in what is essentially now a red state, used to flip around a lot. I fully endorse your sentiment at my own expense. We have worked with government in Canada for decades now. We love all the friends we have made in your country.\n\nI used to travel a lot to do trainings. It was an exceptionally eye opening experience for me about just how wonderful your country is - and the people in it. Sometimes I would recount my adventures and hear that I have seen more of Canada than most Canadians. From Iqaluit and Yellowknife and Whitehorse to all the provincial capitals and major cities.\n\nI think my first note is that - you don't need to come to the US for vacations. The idea that you do come here has, honestly, always been silly to me. You have unending beauty up there.\n\nIf we lose our chance to work with you - for you - because of who was elected down here, it will be devastating to me. Not only does it truly risk this business itself - it does very much so - but also because this tariff nonsense is a total betrayal of the things we have truly built together. Things that I have a lot of pride in, and things that some of you may use every day.\n\nOur customers are truly now my friends. Friends in every province and territory. I know I won't lose them as friends, but I will lose our constant contact. Real, sincere tears will be shed.\n\nBut even with that in mind. Even at the risk of our business. At the risk of my friendships. PLEASE do these things even if the tariffs don't materialize.\n\nAnd to the point of being kind to Americans - I do recommend it. It may not be apparent, but the Dear Leader didn't even suggest tariffs on Canada until after the election. It was not in the platform, and was at least not openly discussed. While I am a left-leaning centrist (in the context of US politics, that makes me a far left radical down here), and never even thought of voting for Trump, some that I know are even regretting their vote over this and other things.",

                            "body": "sure [https://canadiangamedevs.com/](https://canadiangamedevs.com/) this site is just has studios based in Canada. Some of those will be larger and bought by bigger publishers, including American ones, but honestly the best way to deal with that is checking what individual games were published under. A lot of these studios are smaller Indie studios though, and the list is broken down by province. They also have section advertising Indie games specifically (again, publishing is a different matter, but a smaller american studio that grants more artistic freedom and less shitty working and consumer policies is better than a triple A studio in line with the rapidly forming oligarchy down south)\n\nBalatro is an Indie game that was developed in Saskatchewan, and published by a UK publisher\n\nKun\u2019tewiktuk: A Mi\u2019kmaw Adventure is an upcoming game being developed and I think published by the same company based in Cape Breton \n\nTunic was developed in Canada but published by the American Finji\n\nCuphead was developed and published by MDHR which is Canadian\n\nBehavior Interactive is a larger studio (I think they call themselves Indie, you could probably debate how much they belong on this list but I\u2019ll put them here anyway) and is the studio behind dead by daylight. DBD has multiple publishers but none of them are American to my knowledge. DBD does however have US licensed characters, and in game transactions. It\u2019s not from what I\u2019ve seen stuff that I\u2019d consider predatory (from what I can tell, the non licensed stuff which makes up the bulk of the content is all available for the in game and real world currency, and not for a ton of in game currency either) so again, may be a studio people disagree as being suitable for this list\n\nthere\u2019s also the world outside of Canadian and USamerican gaming\n\nAustralia has Team Cherry which developed and published Hollow Knight and is currently working on. the sequel\n\nTaiwan has Red Candle Games which developed and published Nine Sols, Detention, and Devotion\n\nI also don\u2019t want say people shouldn\u2019t buy from larger studios and publishers at all, there\u2019s nuance especially as with gaming a lot of things are done internationally (even if you get a game from a canadian studio and publisher, there\u2019s also what distributors you have available and if switch distributors is a realistic option). However Ubisoft specifically has been criticized for a variety of worker abused (particularly towards its female employees) and some of the anti consumer practices. So I\u2019d personally say we should look to other studios besides them to support (though I think gaming and other creative industries will be a little bit weirder for lists like these and might deserve their own conservation)",

The brand they do eat is almost 100%  produced in the USA, with a fair few Canadian-sourced ingredients. \n\nWith tariffs looming I'm picking up a few extra bags/cans. Even if the facilities keep operating they may have trouble getting quality ingredients, and if retaliatory tariffs happen we may have trouble importing whatever the finished product is. \n\nSo, for those of you who can, look into made-in-Canada pet food - ask your vet, do some research. PetValu and other boutique pet retailers are probably a good place to start. For those of you who can't - maybe grab some extra now, just in case supply/quality is impacted. \n\nI'm perfectly willing to alter my buying habits for myself and accept less suitable alternatives for some things, but I can't - and won't - sacrifice the health of my pets with unsuitable alternatives.

Canada is just 5-10% of the market for Walmart, Costco, etc., but it's 100% of the livelihood of their Canadian employees. (This remark is not about me. I'm retired with no kids in the workforce.)",

I knew Trump was unhinged, but this is worse than imagined, he's trying to turn us against each other, and also take over the USA as a dictator. Trump is a bumbling fool, but he has slightly smarter sinister people guiding him, and as bumbling and incoherent as he may be, he is deadly serious about his crazy plans to take over as a dictator, and expand the USA taking over sovereign states as if it's a game of Risk.\n\n\nTrump is a 19th century backwards thinker, who needs to be targeted the most, including his enablers such as Elon. It's easy to not buy a Tesla, and avoid traveling to the USA, hit them where it hurts the most.\n\n\nCanada needs to fix its own set of problems, such as getting rid of inter-provincial trade barriers, fixing a taxation mess that represses investments in Canada, and places unneeded high burdens on businesses, including very high taxation on those who succeed the most, which is extremely demotivating. The taxation and business climate here in Canada, is so bad many of us leave for the USA, and despite Trump, I may still happen unless there's enough changed made here.\u00a0\n\n\nAt least Carney is promising some change, and unlike Trudeau or PP, he knows what it's like to have a job, manage your own finances, and earn an income, but we're looking at decades of built up crap to fix, and that takes a lot of time and political will to desl with, ie, not much improvements are likely to happen any time soon.",
