            "body": "As a broiler chicken producer in Ontario I can say it goes way beyond just the size of our farms. Although, not as prevalent as in the states we also have large industrial size farms. \n\nSupply management doesn't just control the supply output it is highly regulated. For broilers if we have over 1% mortality in 24hrs we must report it to the CFO (Chicken Farmers of Ontario) and have a vet out. If AI is confirmed then they set up a 3km & 10km control zone with strict rules & testing for all flocks within these zones. We also have AI insurance through the CFO, so if we are affected, the financial impact is mitigated, which also reduces the likelihood of farmers ignoring issues in the early stages. \n\nEvery 2 years we need to have our barns audited by CFO. They are very serious about ensuring bird netting & other controls are in place. \n\nAlso, our biosecurity is just much higher than theirs. We have strict biosecurity we need to follow, including barn specific clothing & boots. An article I read out of the states said they could mitigate spread between barns by changing clothes & boots between barns but it was too costly to implement. I read that a month ago, and I'm still stocked that they are just going into barns one after the other with the same boots. AI is spread primarily through the fecal oral route so changing boots should be priority #1.",

Which I believe was covered under benefits. So always a minimum of a day sitting idle before they enter a new barn.\n\n\n\nVisit one barn a day at most.\n\n\nHas booty covers available as well. And as far as I know, suits up when visiting barns, and I believe at least the larger ones have shower facilties?\u00a0\n\n\nAnd this protocol isn't even chicken specific here.\u00a0\n\n\nWhy they wouldn't have basic biosecurity protocols in the US is absolutely flabbergasting.",

The slightly higher prices we pay for poultry and dairy are worth it. \nIronically, Trump has already fired a massive amount of public health veterinarians and federal vets that were researching AI in spite of this ongoing outbreak as part of the DOGE fiasco. They also started cancelling CDC reporting and info sessions for vets regarding testing and current AI epidemiology stats, which is also insane.

These practices are enforced because every fresh product that is sold in shops has the name of the farm it came from on it, and that is tracked along the whole route the food takes to get to you.\n\nSo you know what you're getting. And the producer knows they're fucked if they don't follow good practices.\n\nThere have been instances of fraud (horse lasagna) and those involved got jail terms. The traceability of British meat was key to these arrests.\n\nIn contrast, in the US, bad meat is made good for sale with chemicals. 20% of it contains antibiotic resistant e-coli. Grim.",

If you know about the BSE scandal, you'll know what happened to the entire industry as a result, and you'll know that BSE has not been a problem in the UK for over twenty years. For those that don't know, however...\n\nBSE is a neurological wasting disease that crossed from cattle into humans, where it is known as CJD. It was a massive scandal and affected a great many people, not just those who died horribly. There was understandable public outrage.\n\nNew farming practices, monitoring and testing programmes were introduced. Not just in cattle, but sheep and goats, also. Strict rules were introduced for feed, shelter, identification and monitoring, containment, and so on. Millions of cows were burned. The economic impact of dealing with the problem has been estimated at \u00a311bn.\n\nHowever, British livestock is now amazingly well cared for. We have some of the strongest livestock welfare laws in the world. There is complete traceability of animal carcasses. Between 1997 and 2003 CJD infection rates went from 37,000 pa to 900. It's currently below the European average rate of infection. It's something I think the UK can be incredibly proud of.\n\nFor anyone that's interested, here's the UK government website covering animal welfare https://www.gov.uk/guidance/animal-welfare",

This guys personal experience might be true and I\u2019m not arguing with him but for me personally the reason we haven\u2019t had as much problems as the states is just the fact that our barns are smaller and much much farther apart than theirs.   The company I work for is owned by the same company that owns the largest producers of laying hens and breeding hens in North America and they are based in the US and frankly they put our biosecurity to shame.  It\u2019s not even close they take it way more seriously and have way more guidelines in place than when we were owned by a local Canadian guy.  Obviously that\u2019s corporate and I can\u2019t speak to individual farms, but it just kind of seems like we\u2019re taking a leg out of the states here for popularity on Reddit.  \n\nThe US really has had way more Avian flu than we have had and the reasons are more similar to the article than some sort of Canadian genius and work ethic.  BC has also been hit hard by avian flu and it\u2019s likely because there\u2019s are larger and closer together.  Also more birds on the coasts likely carrying the flu.",

And obviously we have the whole ordeal with eggs. \nHonestly with the U.S. threatening our sovereignty do we want to depend on them for food also?  \n\nThe supply management system has a few benefits that often get overlooked. \nIt keeps  little more profit in the hands of farmers vs processors.   In the U.S. the egg and chicken farmers are basically contract growers for large corps (Tyson) who are vertically integrated and make the money while the farmer makes enough to survive.  This leads to lack of profit on the farm, build the cheapest barns you can find that then have low biosecirity standards and voila!  Avian flu runs rampant. \n\nAnother benefit is the economic spinoff.  \nThere would be very little or no dairy or poultry in maritimes or prairies.  The cost of production is quite a bit higher than Ontario.  Every one of those farmers has a vet, accountant, equipment dealer etc.    We would have the majority of livestock production in Ontario.  \n\nThe reason the farmers in the U.S. have the ability to make cheaper milk and eggs is that Ag in the U.S. is heavily subsidized by the govt.  So the grain is artificially cheap that feeds the livestock in addition to the dairy revenue programs that pay them when prices are low.   In these cases whether you consume these products or not as a taxpayer you are funding the dairy and egg farmers.   In Canada if you don\u2019t eat eggs you aren\u2019t paying the farmer. \n\nSo yes if you want so the more like the U.S. and creative a bigger divide between the rich and poor, depend and a country that is threatening us for our food supply, have crappier bio security, and also start having to send income equalization payments to our friends in the maritimes then yes start to dismantle supply management.",

It's possible that Trump may disrupt those subsidies, they are certainly in DOGE's sights, but boy, that will be an interesting, of the Republicans lose the farmers, there's a good many pretty solid Republican voters who either vote Dem or just stay home.\n\nAt any rate, Canadian agricultural policies were developed in no small part to create a stable supply; it's the classic project management problem: you can have it quick, you can have it cheap or you can have it good - pick two, and Canada has, in various forms since the Depression, favored agricultural policies that create a stable supply, with some sacrifice made in tending to put prices higher.\n\nFor me, supply management is an example of \"perfection is the enemy of the good.\" In the Canadian context, it has been a successful policy. Maybe more market-based policies, with the right regulation, might do better, but as it stands, supply management seems a reasonable compromise that by and large delivers what is intended.

Take the emissions market (carbon tax) or even the wholesale energy market, where decisions that impact the market are driven by independent regulatory bodies and system operators (engineers), but markets are regulated within this to offset the cost of public ownership and associated liabilities of the facilities. So as a socialist, when arguing for increased public ownership over our utilities like telecom, raw materials, etc, I'm willing to concede that what specifically should be owned by who/what is a more difficult topic than whether we have the technology to manage our economy. \n\nCanada is also a good example of a capitalist social democracy with a mixed economy, and while we don't enjoy public ownership of our raw materials, there is a class of people who effectively \"own\" assets of companies which extract raw materials in the form of pension funds. \n\nThis is all to say the \"tyranny\" people view of supply management is one that politics exploits and many people have strong opinions about, but decoupled from politics the material exchange of goods/services currently utilizes central planning on a scale that even the most totalitarian communist regimes would be envious of.",

The US consumes 10 billion chickens a year and apparently they killed 150 million since 2022 due to avian flu. Would killing + composting a chicken even lead to a noticeable increase in carbon emissions compared to raising it for a month then killing + consuming + replacing it? If anything not raising it for a month probably reduced carbon e missions. \n\n\n> And now with the lack of eggs, would it lead to people to eat less or find other sources of protein that may cost even more? \n\n\n\nLet\u2019s assume people paid the max price of $6/dozen (source FRED) over the last 4m. Google says average person eats roughly 280 eggs/year so let\u2019s say 2 dozen/month. Compared to the august low of $2/dozen they would\u2019ve paid a max of an extra $8/month for their eggs. I\u2019m gunna go out on a limb and say 99% of people aren\u2019t affected or are maybe mildly annoyed. \n\n\n\n> And what about potential health issues if this egg shortage lasts a long time? \n\n\n\nEgg shortage is pretty much over already. Also not sure what potential health issues you\u2019re referring to.",

Lot's of small farms gets you redundancy over low prices.\n\nBut the real bugger and the reason the big vs small barn is a big deal to the market is that once you purge the barn you have to keep it empty for a few months(just what I've been told by farmers here). Bird flu is no joke, and why they go to such extremes to try and stop it from getting in.\n\nAnd one of the big pieces they miss is *how* that system exists. If we could make massive factories we sure as shit would(it's not like people don't like scaling up in Canada). What we have here is a system where you get a ticket from the government to raise a certain number of birds. Each ticket is, as far as I know, is worth the same number of birds and it's possible to have multiple. Now the problem is you can't just ask and get one. Everyone who is eligible gets put in a pool and it's a lottery. \n\nOh and to make it more fun you can actually sell it if you want, but you have to have had(and I think used it) for a certain number of years first. It's actually work a few hundred K and I'm told is often the most valuable thing in an egg farm(eggs don't make much money on a small scale apparently).\n\nAnd as for no automation, that's just not true from what I've seen. Even the small barns have automation of some level. I think the most manual step I've seen is the egg packing. I mean can you imagine trying to pick eggs from twenty five thousand birds trying to peck you?\n\nOh, and you don't need a ticket for something like a hundred chickens(I don't know the exact number, someone just told me there's an amount you don't need a license).",

But the impact on Canada's egg supply has so far been limited.\n\n>Von Massow suggests a number of explanations for that. **It gets colder in Canada, so barns are more tightly sealed, which helps keep flu virus carried by wild birds out. Canada also has fewer free-range chickens, which are more susceptible to getting infected**.\n\n>But perhaps the biggest difference is that **egg farms in Canada are much smaller, so when one farm does suffer a flu outbreak, the effects are less far-reaching. The typical egg farm in Canada has about 25,000 laying hens, whereas many farms in the U.S. have well over a million**. In effect, American farmers have put a lot more of their eggs in a relatively small number of baskets.",

Many have had their barns culled and they lose a lot of income as their barns are empty for months before restocking. No one goes into those barns or onto those farms without a reason. Any dead birds are put in special bins at the end of the property and tested by government. Flocks are tested before going to market. Birds die very quickly from avian flu so our food source is very safe as they do not get to the processing plants. We have had outbreaks for decades so farmers are very knowledgeable about how to deal with it.  We are fortunate to live in a country where government and farmers are taking every precaution to protect us. Fyi there is no free range because avian flu is spread by wild birds so flocks are not outside. Save your money and buy regular chicken or eggs.  Get cracking!",

IMO having a reliable source of food is important for national security, and well worth paying for.\n\nThe problem with supply management is it forces that increase in payment directly to consumers. Last estimate I saw was $300-400 per household per year. The problem with this is that the extra costs hurts poorer Canadians more than richer ones. Someone making minimum wage is paying a much larger % of there income towards supply management than someone in the top 1%.\n\nIf supporting Canadian farmers is a national priority (and I believe it should be) it should be paid for with a progressive system where higher income earners pay more into it (like a progressive income tax).\n\nI\u2019d like to see changes to the system that see more of the increased costs paid for by progressive tax dollars than direct costs, although I\u2019ll admit I don\u2019t know how to get there",
