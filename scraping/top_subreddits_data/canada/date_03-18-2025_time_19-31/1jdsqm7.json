People in big cities are known for being comparatively more socially-inward. Most people don't know their neighbours, or make chitchat in elevators or shopping queues. It's the small towns where people are more likely to get in your business and judge you if you're the quiet type.",

It's not common for many people to embrace change with an open mind and reflect on current realities and facts. \n\n\nCanada has a long history of not voting politicians into power, but voting them out.  With Trudeau stepping down voluntarily, and Mark Carney graciously running for PM, it's a different story. \n\n\nI also agree that the way the Conservatives down south are behaving and treating other humans is not acceptable, and could definitely infiltrate our own politics.  Mark will stand up for Canada and Pierre will likely annex us as the 51st state the first change he gets.",

Canada isn't alone in this even if we have unique factors that we could adjust, but most of those are provincial and municipal!\n\nHe made people angry at the carbon \"tax\" when we implemented one to help with the environment and also trade with Europe. He blamed corporate greed, profits, and late stage capitalism on a federal program that ensured people and businesses paid, with Canadians receiving at least a portion of that amount so companies couldn't profit.\n\nHe used hatred and anger to attack and blame Trudeau and the liberal party for every single issue Canadians were facing and did it by piggybacking off the rhetoric and language of the Republicans and trump.\n\nThat was fine until trump got into office and decided to do what he said he would and go full fascist, and then threaten Canadian sovereignty. You can't undo 3 or 4 years of campaign slogans and catering to the fear and anger people feel because of the effects of a global pandemic that increased wealth disparity and made everything a little less unaffordable.\n\nNow, as people across all political stripes come together to put as much pressure on the US as possible, PP is forced into a corner with 2 options. He either goes back on the promises he's made his wealthy donors and friends and gives up on the Republican and American style political garbage, or he continues so he keeps those voters and that money and also tries to show everyone he's changed.\n\nI watched his speech when Trudeau and team announced the retaliatory tariffs. The liberals were cohesive and talking about how strong Canada and its people are. PP's speech talked about how bad we already have it thanks to Trudeau and how much everyone's lives suck. How is that inspirational? It's so out of touch and frankly insulting by saying this country is broken and is worthless. We aren't and thank god we had JT and team in power to start us off on a really strong foot. \n\nI'll post his speech here if I can find it. I'll edit this post with the link so you can see exactly how uninspiring PP is and how little he cares about anyone but himself.",

So yes, I was personally seeing a net positive of the rebate program because I personally had no costs to offset. If, on the other hand, I was still living in a rural area, driving an old Jeep, and blah blah blah, that would cost more than the rebate would cover. Mayyyybe. \n\nBut yes, *of course* carbon pricing costs money. That\u2019s the point. The money funds things that are affected by climate change (like health care, for example), infrastructure, and rebate programs to improve energy efficiency/reduce carbon emissions. That\u2019s literally the point of carbon *pricing*. \n\nWhoosh, right?",

Thats how everyone feels about PP now, except the people who are going to vote for any CPC leader no matter who he is. \n\nCanada doesnt want PP, the polls show it, social media shows it and the election will show it.",

That's your CoL crisis, directly resulting from the economic crisis that was Covid. \n\nThis is largely the issue with people like you. You can't understand how long term these issues are, and you make no effort to understand. That's why you don't get why we compare ourselves to other nations in the G7, because you can't even relate Canada's issues to events that happened \"over half a decade ago\". That's a decent amount of time for you or I. That is PEANUTS to a nation, PEANUTS to the lifecycle of a government. \n\nImmigration being an attempt to maintain our economy in the face of an aging population and stagnating industry is important, and while it was poorly implemented it was and continues to be the shared responsibility of the federal government and the provinces. Unemployment is a provincial issue more than it is a federal one.\n\nNow your anger makes sense. You don't understand monetary policy or macroeconomics. \n\nYou're right, we do have a pervasive issue with crime, and yet that too isn't exclusively a federal issue. \n\nOf course you're angry at the liberals, you don't know enough to know who else to blame. They're not perfect, they've made mistakes, but they're absolutely not the reason for all of Canada's issues.",

That's what happens when you have unfettered liberal spending.\n\nAnd no, housing is so fucked up because of the amount of people we brought in without building infrastructure to support them.\n\n>This is largely the issue with people like you. You can't understand how long term these issues are, and you make no effort to understand. That's why you don't get why we compare ourselves to other nations in the G7, because you can't even relate Canada's issues to events that happened \"over half a decade ago\". That's a decent amount of time for you or I. That is PEANUTS to a nation, PEANUTS to the lifecycle of a government.\n\nThe entire lifecycle of a government in Canada is 5 years.  It's not peanuts.  \n\n>Immigration being an attempt to maintain our economy in the face of an aging population and stagnating industry is important, and while it was poorly implemented it was and continues to be the shared responsibility of the federal government and the provinces. Unemployment is a provincial issue more than it is a federal one.\n\nMaintaining our economy by importing low skilled labour and students?  the very thing that caused unemployment spikes?  especially in the youth? and no, nothing to do with provincial governments there, that was all federal.\n\n>Now your anger makes sense. You don't understand monetary policy or macroeconomics.\n\nOther way around.  You think 24 year old indians are maintaining our economy...\n\n>Of course you're angry at the liberals, you don't know enough to know who else to blame. They're not perfect, they've made mistakes, but they're absolutely not the reason for all of Canada's issues.\n\nThey absolutely are which is why all provinces under different political provincial government parties are all struggling with the same issues.",

It\u2019s hard to rally around sovereignty when the message is laced with blame\u2014claiming we\u2019ve been stupid in the past and remain so under current leadership.\n\nFundamentally, it seems conservatives unite more around opposition\u2014what they dislike\u2014while liberals are more motivated by collective unity.

So much so that I was willing to give the CPCs a shot, and all this despite my teeth-clenching admission that this meant accepting PP as the eventual PM. That was a tough pill to swallow but it was the choice I made. That is, some time ago. \n\nThere\u2019s no need to recount what others have stated far better and more eloquently than me, that being that PP\u2019s lacklustre, eerily silent, to near rudderless performance over the last 2 months (save for a few new verb-the-noun poison arrows and a quickly drawn up and yet ever so disingenuous, thinly veiled \u201cCanada First\u201d refrains) have more than frightened me off. Seriously. \n\nAfter Trudeau\u2019s dead cat bounce in dealing with Trump during his last days in office - admittedly strong and inherently Canadian statesmanlike, probably his true calling, tbh - I\u2019ve moved past those reassurances found in Trudeau\u2019s handling of Trump\u2019s threats and vainglorious bullying and found something far more inspiring: Mark Carney.\n\nMost of what he\u2019s said and done *does* mark a departure from Trudeau. From the manner in which he speaks and thinks, to his steady announcements, to his \u00fcber wry move to head to Europe first, and to his altogether well-governed, more reserved manner in dealing with Trump (that is, define the engagement as an *adult* does) I feel calmer as a Canadian. I don\u2019t entirely see the path ahead but I cannot but witness a sense of gravity taking over. Slowly, sure, but who isn\u2019t looking for the comfort of solid ground right now?\n\nSo? What\u2019s the point of all this rehash and nimble recognitions?\n\nThe point is that I am voting for Mark Carney. At least until something changes, but that change would have to be more narrowly defined by who and what is best for all of Canada in this current climate.\n\nNot the Liberals (and I hope I don\u2019t fall on my sword)\nNot the Conservatives \nNot the NDP\nNot any party\n\nI\u2019m voting for Carney.\n\nIt really doesn\u2019t matter if he is Liberal. I understand the risk given the history of the last Trudeau mandates.\n\nI would 100% vote for Carney if he were CPC, too. Pinky swear. \n\nI understand how our Parliamentary system works well enough and that we do not, in fact, vote for the leader. \n\nBut I am. And I sense others will too. Especially if this sensible, well-governed man keeps acting the way he has been. \n\nI\u2019m voting for Carney under the (hopefully correct!) assumption that he has a plan, a platform, and a sense of leadership that goes above and beyond the traditional party protocols we\u2019ve seen across all parties. \n\nI know, it\u2019s not a very Westminster style of democracy approach I\u2019m taking \u2026 but who cares?\n\n(I love Canada. And I love my fellow Canadians. It sucks that it took me this long to say this.)",

The removal of the Carbon Tax is just to buy support temporarily until after the election, then they will impose more taxes and tariff systems to meet the 25 year window for net zero that Mark Carney is so frigging obsessed about, global initiatives which he has been heavily involved in.

Look at what Smith and Ford have been doing as Premiers. Constantly defending Canada. A good cop bad cop routine. Where the hell has P.P. been? He blew a 25 point lead in 2 months. He has created his own online social media platform. He produces and releases simplistic and condescending 3 word slogans. That mean nothing. He just released another one yesterday. \u201cLet\u2019s make Canada even greater.\u201d WTF? That sounds exactly like Trump. Don\u2019t blame as he says the Eastern liberal biased media. Blame P.P. He\u2019s not at all recalibrated. He sounds like a mini Trump. Like a broken record. He either can\u2019t or arrogantly, won\u2019t change. He refuses to travel stateside into the lions den and make his case for Canada. Is he afraid? P.P. mostly, refuses to engage in Q & A media scrums. And on the rare occasions he does, he comes across as overly negative with a chip on his shoulder, who talks down to people. He both turns off and scares Canadians as being too much like Trump. Even my in laws in Quebec, who hate Trudeau and have a conservative MP in Chicoutimi/Jonquiere are turned off by P.P. who is dragging down support for the Tories in Quebec, because he is unlikeable and considered not very bright. Eg. A majority of Quebecois each Sunday night turn on Toute le Monde en Parle. Like a religion. But guess what? P P. refuses to go on this program. And the host Guy A LePage says he has repeatedly, extended an invite. Why won\u2019t P.P. go? All the other politicians show up. Because Radio Canada is CBC? Who cares. It\u2019s great exposure. Is he afraid of some tough questions? Last night they talked about him and Trump. How he still refuses to get his top secret security clearance. How he lives in his own self created media bubble. Like Trump. Because he refuses to go on this program, he can\u2019t defend himself. Being a leader of the official opposition or Prime Minister means getting out of your comfort zone. Having the guts to make your case in front of hostile audiences. They were saying last night on Toute le monde that Pierre P. lacks courage. And he is intellectually, a light weight. Especially compared to Dr. Mark Carney, PhD - Oxford and a collegiate hockey player at Harvard University. I grew up in Edmonton and Falun, Alberta and I\u2019m voting Carney.

Or do you not know? Because an AR-15 is not capable of automatic fire, it's semi-automatic. It's also limited by law to 5 round magazines, as all centrefire firearms in Canada are. It was also classified restricted before it's ban in 2020, meaning you weren't allowed to hunt with it, only take it to a range to have some fun with. It also fires a 5.56 round which is illegal to hunt deer with because it's not powerful enough, my Tikka T3X fires a more powerful round from the same 5 round magazine, just isn't semi auto.\n\nSo what makes it an assault rifle again?",

That I greatly enjoy the time I spend cleaning and oiling, and that going to the range with my brother or my neighbours is a great time?\n\nThe counter argument to that is, well you don't need THESE guns, and to which I can say, why not? They're not any more or less dangerous. Maybe I prefer how it looks, or how it feels? There's a lot more going on than just make and model. Every gun is different, eats ammo different, no two are the same. My homesteader might take blazer 123gr 9mm and shoot best with that, someone else's gun might not shoot that good with it, and need a different brand. There's a lot of skill and time that goes into this hobby and I deeply enough it. I'd like everyone to have the opportunity to do so, and it greatly saddens me that so many see gangsters and criminals as the reason to ban something that makes me happy.\n\nI got in a chat with a guy a week or so ago now, discussing what it would take for me to be satisfied. I told him that I considered Canadian gun laws to be arguably the best on earth in terms of licensing to restrictions on use. We're all taught how to be safe above all else, and we're under a lot of scrutiny. I told him that as much as I'd love access to machine guns and the like, that'll likely never happen in Canada. So I'd settle for everything semi-auto and down, ideally with magazines opened up and suppressors legalized, as they are good for keeping your hearing and keeping noise pollution down. Contrary to popular belief they don't actually make a gun silent, movies do that for effect. Then we put more funds into attacking people who break the law, traffic illegal firearms, engage with gangs and criminality. Stuff that will actually keep Canadians safe and allow us all more freedom.\n\nI'm very much on edge about this sort of thing because, if you look elsewhere in this thread, people get dismissive. \"Oh well you can just give it up, it doesn't matter, you don't need it. It's for the greater good of society.\" Ya, easy to say when you don't have it. Imagine I took a hobby away from you because I decided it was bad for you, then banned it, told you you're a nut if you care about it so much.",

We are likely now decades behind the curve on pipelines because of the liberals virtue signaling when during covid and the Ukraine/Russia war we could have been paying down our debt and funding all these new social programs by providing LNG and oil to Germany and other nations. Next year we are going to be paying over 100 billion dollars on interest payments alone on our debt. We have the most household debt of any G7 nation and we also had to lower interest rates before any other G7 nation because our economic outlook is horrible. We have also had a significant brain drain to the US where wages are higher and taxes are lower and quality of life in many states is considered higher. We were at the 5th happiest in the world and are now 15th. We are also bleeding capital and cannot bring in new capital or investments because we keep threatening additional luxury taxes and capital gains taxes, which unfortunately, hits our family doctors the most when it comes to retirement because they have had to (advised to for financial reasons) incorporate themselves.\n\nYou can wear rose-colored glasses all you want and people can gaslight us like Freeland does during question period about how Canada has the best economy in the world but the only thing this government successfully did economically was kicking the gigantic, Newfoundland-sized can down the road to mask our economic numbers behind the third highest growing country population-wise in the world. You know, the thing that also led to a horrific housing crisis for most non-asset holding Canadians where vacancy rates were/are still at 1% or less in every major city in the country and homelessness is skyrocketing while simultaneously increasing refugee and asylum seekers by 2500%.\n\nBut like I said, we deserve what we vote for like the Americans deserve what they vote for.",

If people prefer the devil they don't know to the devil they do, then it might be worth reevaluating Poilievre (if it is your intent to vote for him).\n\nFor those of us keeping abreast of politics the last fifteen or more years, Carney is one of the top economical figures in the world and his positions and accomplishments in some of the worst financial events in recent Canadian and UK memory precede him.  I totally get that if someone were disconnected from that news (thinking about the 2008 recession, the Harper years, and Brexit), they wouldn't know who he is.  But now's a good a time as any to start doing some research since you, and others, now know the name and could stop yourself from being an uninformed voter.  But that's up to you, of course.  :)",

I cannot vote liberal based on how the last 9 years have gone and they deserve to be punished for it. But also have a hard time wanting to vote for PP.

Neoliberal Trudeau just continued Neoliberal Harper's neoliberal policies, and continued to oppress the middle class and siphon their money to the rich class he works for.\n\nIt is bizarre how people continue to worship these anti-middle class charlatan neoliberals decade after decade. It has been around 4 decades now that none of the PMs/parties have worked for the people. Instead of people realizing this after 4 decades, they continue to fall for the same simple minded divide+conquer strategies. They continue to listen to those childish political ads in which these neoliberals fake-attack each other using childish personal attacks, using tax payer money. The cycle will continue. Neoliberal Carney will win any election, and people are worshiping him now, but after a few years of not heeding my warning, they will then realize that indeed he too has nothing to offer the middle class, then they will turn on him and choose another neoliberal. I gave the same warning for Trudeau: people attacked me and said silence hair and weed. Where did that get them? A decade of their money being siphoned off to the rich class and being worse off. And now they will do the same with Carney, they are worshiping him for no reason. Mark my words things will continue to get worse for the middle class under Carney too. This is because he too is a neoliberal. The problem is neoliberalism. Until that is addressed, nothing will change. So rinse and repeat every 10 or so years. The definition of insanity is making the same mistake over and over again. Bizarre that after 4 decades people have not woken up to this simple reality.\n\n\"BUT WHAT OTHER OPCHION DO WEE HAAAAAV!?\" Huh? How about not willingly and voluntarily putting your oppressors in power: why on earth would they be accountable to you or change when you keep putting them in power for free? Didn't the last 4 decades show this? So why would you continue a strategy that has not worked: the onus on you is to justify your strange and irrational strategy, not to keep using whataboutism. \"BUT ISN\"T IT BETTER TO VOTE FOR THE LESSER EVIL\"? Only if this strategy worked. Has it worked? In 4 decades, has this strategy made things worse or better. It has made things worse. The middle class has progressively been worse off every decade under neoliberalism, for the past 4 decades. So no, this strategy has not worked, and there is no logical or plausible reason to believe it ever will. At least if there was a tiny bit of upward movement/improvement you can justify this strategy, but when things have progressively been moving in the opposite/wrong direction, then how can continue this strategy be logical?\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot)\n\nEDIT: unsurprisingly being downvoted. This is why we have problems. When people worship and can't accept criticism of the neoliberal politicians they bizarrely worship, we can't have nice things. Imagine worshiping rich privileged neoliberals like Harper/Trudeau/Pierre/Carney who don't care about you or don't even know what it is like to live a middle c;lass life and who put the profit of American and foreign corporations and billionaires like Blackrock over you, or Canadian billionaires an corporations like O'Leary and Loblaws over you.\n\nHarper and Trudeau allowed US corporation blackrock, and guys like this:\n\n[https://globalnews.ca/news/8637896/xiao-jianhua-family-companies-150-million-toronto-real-estate/](https://globalnews.ca/news/8637896/xiao-jianhua-family-companies-150-million-toronto-real-estate/)\n\nto price out the Canadian middle class from being able to buy homes. But now I am being downvoted because Trudeau used crocodile tears on camera with empty words when his actions over decade destroyed the middle class. When people keep worshiping these politicians and silencing those who criticize them, this is why we can't have nice things.",
