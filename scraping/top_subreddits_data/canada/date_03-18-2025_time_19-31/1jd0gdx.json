At the same time, everyone is invited to visit r/Greenland to ask questions of any sort that you've always been curious about in their respective post.\n\nThere's a lot that we share, beginning with land above the arctic circle, First Nations people that live there, and plenty of chances to discuss current events.\n\nReminder to please be respectful, as if you were inviting 3,000 of your closest friends from Greenland over to your house.\n\nSee you then!",
