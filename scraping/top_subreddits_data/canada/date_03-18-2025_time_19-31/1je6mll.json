Because provincial politicians want to be reelected they create regulations that favour industry in their province - so Ontario wineries want rules to protect their market we get rules that prevent BC wineries from selling in Ontario.  Newfoundland & Labrador has a rule that you can sell beer in corner stores as long it's brewed in the province, and so that keeps small local breweries going.  Then there's the control of professional organizations.  Every province establishes their own regulations for teachers, doctors, nurses, truck drivers, etc. because those are areas of provincial jurisdiction and so those become restrictions that deter people moving between provinces because they have to meet different license requirements if they decide to move.  Those are a few examples, but it becomes very complicated, and detailed work to untangle some of these restrictions.",

That one is the easiest.\n\nWe already have an aviation industry in Canada, and we also manufacture lots of other types of military equipment in Canada. We can, again, leverage the talent we already have in-country to help upscale those operations as well. Moreover, Saab offered to manufacture Gripen aircraft in Canada when that deal was on the table, so we have a path to expanding those industries with the help of our allies (incidentally, we were pressured by the United States to opt out of the Gripen deal in favor of the F-35 deal, which is an example of Canada prioritizing American interests over Canadian ones). We also have a good education system and lots of Universities and Colleges to help train new talent, which we can incentivize by subsidizing the programs that train, say, aerospace engineers.\n\nAnd in terms of customers, for oil the US will always be a customer, but also we can expand to selling more to the EU and China (this will require more East-West pipelines). And we're planning on expanding our armed forces, so we would be the first customers for say, fighter jets.\n\nI think that your assessment is more doom and gloom than it should be.

That one is the easiest.\n\nWe haven't done this because it didn't make economic sense and still doesn't. The market was ONLY for crude and that too in the US. We have no proper logistics to export crude to other countries (there's an ocean in the middle). You can't just \"build\" pipelines wherever we wish.\n\n>We can, again, leverage the talent we already have in-country to help upscale those operations as well.\n\nNo we don't. Most left to the states.\n\n>We also have a good education system and lots of Universities and Colleges to help train new talent, which we can incentivize by subsidizing the programs that train, say, aerospace engineers.\n\nAgain, it is going to take decades. Most of our best engineers go to the US right now for higher wages. You cannot just increase wages here and make them stay here overnight. \n\n>And in terms of customers, for oil the US will always be a customer, but also we can expand to selling more to the EU and China (this will require more East-West pipelines). And we're planning on expanding our armed forces, so we would be the first customers for say, fighter jets.\n\nYou make this sound all so easy. Do you really think the policy makers haven't thought about all these? \n\nInvesting in all these means printing a ton of money and drowning the country in recession. Its a slow painful process spanning decades and we definitely need the US. We should have done this loooong back. Not when we have tariffs on our heads.",

I also think it's important to remember that we're not alone in this. When people in Canada talk about tariffs (the media I mean specifically) , it seems like they're acting like Trump's tariffs on  Canada are happening in a vacuum, but there's a long list of countries, most of which are already our allies, that are getting the same treatment. It won't be long until counter attacks against the USA's stupid trade war start to be more coordinated. The USA may be able to bully Canada into the ground, but not if we're also backed by the ANZUK nations, the EU, China, and a giant swath of South and Central America. We're not alone, and we can make this a long term advantage as opposed to a detrimental defeat if we play our cards right I think.",

With an actual strong industry those jobs and high wages raise other work prospects to surrounding areas.\nA rising tide raises all boats. \nIn the case of 1 auto assembler 5000 manufacturing jobs helps employ 30000 in the local area\n\nLook at the devastation to towns like St. Thomas or Hamilton from job loss, and pay loss when you see with manufacturing leaving.",

You are also forgetting the reason industry has been able to get things approved is because they can largely bypass C-69 as the UCP won a victory over the liberals in the Supreme Court.  Think about it, the government of Alberta literally had to blow millions in legal fees against the feds to provide regulatory certainty to the sector, help development thrive, and gain/preserve thousands of jobs.  It\u2019s pushed out multiple mine expansions, it\u2019s killed pipelines, and it\u2019s completely eroded confidence in foreign capital entering Canada which drives up sector productivity and wages.  A big reason industry capex trended back towards historic levels (higher) was TMX completion, but a significant piece was that operators were comfortable actually putting forward facility regulatory amendments for expansions because the UCP secured a victory against C-69 in 2023 and they had confidence they wouldn\u2019t have their approvals rejected by the feds. \n\nIf you look at M&A trends literally every major and US E&P has exited, and a significant portion of this is federal government posturing towards resource development and AGR.  \n\nAll I\u2019m stating is simply quoting oil production grew under the liberals without context is ridiculous. That\u2019s like saying GDP grew under the liberals so obviously the economy is healthy while ignoring a million other factors.\n\nAlso, you said O+G was propped up. Please expand on this, it\u2019s a key component of your argument.  The industry isn\u2019t asking for subsidies and don\u2019t need to rely on them, we are just asking for the feds to get out of the fucking way primarily.\n\nAlso, the reason the liberals bought TMX in the first place is because they sent to project into regulatory and legal hell. If the conservatives win in 2015 that pipeline is built by the private sector at likely 0.5x the cost.  \n\nThe industry requires no subsidies.  Why? Because Canada is top 3 in the world when it comes to being blessed with resource wealth, and the quality and quantity of our holdings dictates that DESPITE government there is still often economic value in extracting the resource.  Trying to argue that the Liberals have been supportive of this proposition denies reality and insults my intelligence.",

That's it.\n\nWhen I was in Grade 10 in my mother country, the geography class taught us sth like the following:\n\n-Raw materials are only theoretically most profitable in the industry chain. \n\n-In reality, only third world countries rely heavily on resources export for economy, at the cost of their own environment. \n\n- This is because global market of natural resource commodity is demand-driven, except oil. For agriculture, woods, and minerals, it is who control the main consumption capabilities, such as consumer market or manufacturing and refining systems that has the price negotiation power. \n\n- Many 3rd world countries can't compete with major global economy players in either of the two, turning themselves into economy slaves of these countries: being exploited for low price resources, and high price products.\n\nThe case study about the theories  is how Latin American countries, Southeastern Asian countries, and African countries were exploited by Western countries in the past and are exploited by China right now.",

The people who he currently and historically has associated himself with speak louder than his words. This is true for all people, and especially politicians.\n\nHe was very recently courting the support of Elon Musk, even publicly stating that we should push to have Tesla factories built in Canada. He has made several other pro-Elon statements and has been endorsed by Elon Musk.\n\nHe has cooled off on the pro-Elon sentiment ever since the Nazi salute at Trump's inauguration, but that's just the bear minimum any politicians with a half-decenr advisor would do.\n\nPierre Poilievre's beliefs and ideals line up PERFECTLY with Musk's, albeit less extreme. There's the faux support for \"free speech\" There's the faux libertarian support for complete deregulation. There's the desire to slash all social spending that benefits poor people (the parasite class as Elon publicly called them). There's the desire to slash taxes on corporations and the wealthy. There's the obsession with demonizing transgender and non-binary people.\n\nThe list goes on and on. PP is perfectly ideologically aligned with a fascist billionaire (who endorsed him), who stated, \"Canada is not a real country,\" (before quickly deleting that tweet), and who controls the US federal government.\n\nHe is also aligned with and openly associates with all the other Republican talking heads who are now spreading anti-Canada misinformation about fentanyl and illegal border crossings. Jordan B Peterson. Ben Shapiro. All of those types.\n\nPP has repeated that same misinformation himself, capitulating to the US Republican framing that there is any real problem on our border that the Liberals are ignoring or actively perpetuating.\n\nI have no reason to believe that if Elon were to say, \"Hey Prime Minister Poilievre, may I start CanaDOGE?\" that he would offer anything other rhan a gleeful and resounding, \"Yes.\"\n\nAs a final note, I don't expect Carney to be a game changer. He's a capitalist through and through. He is not going to bring about revolutionary change for the working class.\n\nBut he WILL maintain the status quo and at least give us another 5 year term before we are once again at risk of descending into a naked fascist oligarchy as is happening in the United States.",
