Carney appears very measure, composed, and pragmatic and has all the expertise, but Poliavre is excellent at rethoric and political speaking. \n\nI think it will be a matter of whether or not Poliavre will be able to drag Carney down to his level where he can beat him with expirence, or whether Carney can remain composed under personall attacks and flippant arguments, and keep the discussion focused on Canadian issues and policy.",

It becomes extremely clear that he's a career politician and Trump sycophant when he rattles off verb-the-noun soundbites about woke leftist elites and cryptocurrency. His biggest weakness is his own personality, and his biggest challenge will be hiding his personality from the public and pretending to be normal on stage.",

Just because a concerted effort to tear down Trudeau worked doesn't mean the replacement to be actually has any substantial policy to improve on the established approach. This tracks when you look at PP's career - all tearing down, but no building whatsoever. The guy simply has no solutions. His very existence is defined by who he opposes. Now that his opposition is gone, he has nothing. He's a paper tiger, and I give him zero credit for fooling Canadians into believing he's anything more than that.

If you'd have me believe that the vast majority of the voter base carefully combs through policy you're out of your damn mind.\n\n>It's just that he lost the \"anybody but JT\" crowd\n\nThis is exactly my point. He has nothing beyond being someone not named Justin Trudeau. That's why everybody left. It's his only defining characteristic, and he shares that characteristic with 39+ million other Canadians.

His stance has remained the same - supporters of those policies are still very much in support of him. Voting based on who you dislike, instead of who you actually think will govern the most effectively based on your values and priorities, is crazy to me.\n\nThe majority of people that discuss politics like to throw out shit constantly as reasons people are bad. I certainly  hope they are reading policy before doing such. You'd have to be a fucking idiot to vote at the federal level without looking at policy, which, I'm sure many are like that but I have respect for my country and in going to assume most people aren't that ignorant.",

The number of people who actually read party platforms other than me, that I've ever met in my entire life, is in the single digits.

They could all get in line and stand together when it's time to vote (the same way the NDP supported the LPC) and still hold their turf other times. That way, they won't have to duke it out (like Scheer and Bernier did during their leadership race). The religious and/or racists could go to the PPC, the ProCons can have their O'Toole/MacKay type, etc. It would just mirror what the left has already had for decades, no? Evidently, a significant chunk of NDP voters *will* vote strategically regardless and frequently do. \n\nMakes me wonder how long their big tent can hold. You can almost see the tension between the Reform and PC wings (however marginal they are) in real-time as PP trots out the new Verb the Noun routine. \n\nHard to win over moderate or centrist Ontarians with an awkward blend of evangelical culture war slop and trite 'bootstraps' economics. If Tories can't even position themselves as the 'safe' party anymore, what do they even have? \n\nSorry for the rant.",

And petrol state? Our whole economy is based off extraction, if anything we should be wagging the finger at the liberals of the previous century who've removed protectionist policies that we've shared with Britain and over the century failed to encourage the expansion of our economy into the services and high tech sector.

No offense, but what I mean by \"vote getter\" is an issue that will net you new votes, not votes from someone who was already gonna vote for you. Vote getting issues are the issues that middle-class, non-ideological, suburban Canadians in Ontario, Quebec, Atlantic Canada, and BC care about. It's the stuff they see on TV that is scary, or important. Those are the people who matter in Canadian politics because those are the only people who change who they vote for. \n\nPierre basically has already done enough to get everyone who is anti-immigration to already vote for him. A few dog whistles here or there, a gesture in the direction of being anti-immigration. Spending more time on it will only alienate the people who want to vote for him for other reasons, but are not anti-immigration. Aka, business people that Pierre needs on his side. \n\n>And unpalatable with business elites - isn't that effectively better for the Conservatives? \n\nNo, no one becomes PM or stays PM without the backing of business elites. That's why both major parties have more or less the same policies for almost every issue. Wealthy elites are the people who run the businesses - they support your policies when you're in office, they trash you in the papers when you act against them too much in the office. It's an ecosystem that they created to their own benefit. \n\nAlso, as an aside - no, most Canadians don't support oil corporations haha. Sorry dude, reddit is a bubble on this one. Oil politics is about as popular as gun politics are in suburbia Canada - Very popular for a few people who are into it and mildly unpopular for everyone else.\n\nBelieve it or not, anti-gun stuff is a vote getter in Suburbia. Try knocking on doors in Suburban Toronto and talking about relaxing gun restrictions - you're getting the door slammed on your face. Suburban moms fucking hate guns, don't know anything about them, and don't have any interest in finding out. Just \"please leave and keep your guns away from me and my children\" vibes. \n\nSame with oil stuff - sure, you can build a coalition with it but the second you leave Alberta most people can basically only tolerate it a little. Oil politics is really tricky because it becomes incredibly toxic politically. You start getting the \"hey what about this oil spill, who has to pay for that, not me right?\" and \"is this project going to impact my property values or make my kids sick?\" questions pretty fucking quick.  \n\nYou and I can scream and cry about that all we want, call these people stupid for their beliefs, think it's all illogical, but it doesn't change reality.",

It be odd if it didn't happen.\n\nIt's important to note, that if the NDP was polling around 16%, then that likely would come entirely from the liberals. So we would be in a tie situation. \n\nI wouldn't count the CPC out yet. The LPC has been in charge for 10 years, and anything can happen. For instance if the ceasefire is permanently broken in Isreal, progressive voters will likely be wedged between the NDP and Israel. It will change the whole narrative and over shadow the trade war. \n\nConsidering everyone had written the liberals obituary back in january, and we are only two months past that; it seems a bit early to write the CPC's obituary no?",

Doug Ford put the majority of the healthcare dollars from the federal government in the general budget instead of the healthcare budget.  He used the general budget to fund things like the private spa at Ontario Place.   If he had put the money in the healthcare budget we would have more family doctors, which would lessen the burden on the hospitals.  If he had put the money in the healthcare budget, we would have enough hospital staff to withstand a rise in the population.   \nOh, and Ford also suspended the healthcare workers charter rights during the pandemic... and he hasn't really restored them either. \n\nImmigration is also partly controlled by the provinces.  They tell the federal government how many immigrants they think they'll need for things like the colleges and universities.  In Ontario Ford allowed a bunch of strip-mall diploma mills to open, increasing the immigration quota. \n\nSo yea, the Premiere's should be taking a load of the blame for the immigration problems too, but for some reason people can't see past the federal Liberal party.",

Mark Carney's net worth, per *Pierre Poilievre News,* is estimated at just under $7M.  And to be honest, that's expected and kind of low for someone of his caliber in the international economics sector.  FWIW, I don't know how that even applies to his take on healthcare (as a start) and your comment doesn't really explain it.  It sounds like you're just suggesting to take your word for things, but at face value, there's nothing there to take-- especially when you're throwing around out-of-date or outright incorrect numbers.\n\nDid you create your account a week before the U.S. election, because if i'm being honest, that's as fishy as it gets with talking points like these.",

If Carney wins with the NDP numbers as they are, it's because he took away all the pragmatic NDP voters. Thee federal NDP will go into stasis, soul searching mode like they did after the 90s. Competent politicians who are already in office like Wab are gonna shy away and focus on their own province.\n\nIf Pierre loses, I am not sure what will happen with the Cons. This would be their biggest let-down ever, and con voters are gonna be PISSED OFF, 2016 Democrats style. But who is there to be an angrier, meaner, conservative than Pierre? Nothing else compares. So they might keep him on. If not, I see them going one of two routes:\n\n* Wealthy, Blue Tory Con donors whip the party into electing a more milktoast, back-to-basics con leader \u00e0 la Erin O'Tool. A pro-business Quebec conservative could do this, if they are pro-resource extraction.\n\n* Dark horse populist conservative no one has heard of who wins on the 5th round of the ballot. \n\nSome people think that one of the con premiers could run, but the only two conservative premiers who fit that bill left are Doug Ford and Tim Houston, both of whom just won massive majorities. Doug Ford has skeletons in his closet that make him VERY unlikely to be national-leader material. Houston could be an option, but he's currently having a moment in NS and politicians from Atlantic Canada can have a hard time getting into federal politics sometimes.\n\n\nThe next factor is that, Unless Carney pulls off a miracle, Canadians are going to HATE him as PM. This happens every time the Libs pick a business Liberal leader - he might represent the \"sane, anti-trump\" right now that people think they want. But Carney is going to face some really tough calls and will probably end up a lot like Keir Starmer, just with a very, VERY angry Alberta chomping at the bit to tear them down. \n\nCarney is, to put it lightly, not a fan of organized labour. He could inspire a more populist, pro-Union NDP since he's likely gonna have to do a lot of Union-busting to keep shit together. Charlie Angus would be this kinda dude and I could see him being elected if he keeps his seat. But if you go too far pro-Union and start promoting protectionism you lose the yuppie vote, and more importantly, you loose every possible in-road into suburban Toronto. So the party is pretty shy about running loudmouths. If the cons shy away from a loudmouth, someone like that could fill the air, though.\n\nMy guess for the more likely choice? The NDP doubles down and chooses another pragmatic yuppie who is popular within the party ranks but can't appeal to anyone who doesn't pay attention to politics closely enough to tell them apart from the Libs.",

The knives will come out for Poilievre, and the moment the Cons fall into such disarray, the Libs (if in minority power) would be all too eager to pounce with a snap election and massacre what's left of the Cons. \n\nI don't know where the country goes from there but I don't think it's anywhere good, to be honest. A new Liberal majority government full of people and policies way past their expiration dates facing broken wrecks of opposition parties (the Bloc might be the only ones still functional!) will be empowered to double and triple down on every policy we've loathed about them these past years.",

He is great at criticism but offers no indepth alternative. And after watching the monkey show south of the border I see way too many parallels between him and Trump. \n\nOn another note I will set politics aside and go with the individual who is best suited to defending our nation from the Americans.  Having an individual with as much experience as Mark Carney is a god send. Who better to wag a trade war than an individual who successfully ran both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England (plus other large financial institutions). He knows the best way to kneecap America and counter Trumps awkward attempts to destroy our nation. He is the best one to understand how to reorient our international trade, he has the contacts. \n\nPierre will not gets his security clearance,  he has none of the skills to go up against Trump. At most he is that dog that is all bark and no bite. Trump would steamroll us into submission under his leadership.  The conservatives will self sabotage our economy,  look at Pierre's move from axing the Carbon tax to that of elimination of the emmission charge on industry. All that would do is move tax revenue to Europe,  we would lose simply because it was a self defeating electoral promise. \n\nMark didn't start out rich he worked his way up from the bottom through hard work and smart financial decisions.  Pierre is a life long career politician who focuses on looking good infront of the camera.",

People who are middle class, don't read the news, don't have a lot of time for political stuff. They live in the burbs are are more focused on work and kids. Those are the only people you need to pay attention to to understand this change. \n\nIt's much, much more simple than you are making it out to be. Here's what happened:\n\n1. Trudeau was PM for a long time and things aren't going well. Pierre was anti-Trudeau, so people started to think \"maybe Pierre will make things cheaper idk Trudeau seems dumb, diversity isn't making gas cheaper\". \n\n2. Trump got elected on basically the same platform Pierre is running on, and immediately went to work attacking Canada. Trump brand politics immediately became \"enemy #1\" for all Canadians.\n\n3. Canadians who vote Liberal but sometimes conservative are the exact sort of Canadians who despise Trump because he is \"very bad and attacking. Canada\". They also feel impacted the most because of the way they rarely engage with politics outside of monumental events. Trump news may be the only news they even follow. So this feels like a massive deal for them.\n\n4. Pierre represents Trump brand politics because he sounds and acts exactly like Trump in the ways that matter to these people. It's impossible not to connect them. \n\n5. Carney is specifically running as \"anti-trump\". He can do that because he isn't a right wing populist.",

His platform is much more centrist, that in it's self is a massive departure. \n\nI think a thing that con voters are struggling with is that they think liberals disapproval of Trudeau was also a disapproval for their party. Realistically, a lot of liberal voters have their gripes, but overall, think that Canada has coped well to the major world events over the last 10 years.\n\nTrouble with Trudeau was he out lived his shelf life. A politician accumulates a lot of baggage being in the hot seat for a decade. \n\nI don't have a problem with the liberals at all, I just need them to have a leader that I am confident will focus them on the issues that really matter, and to make up for lost time on the areas Trudeau's attention drifted from.\n\nI would prefer to vote for an actual leftist Candidate, but we don't have that in Canada. Even the greens are just Eco focused neo-liberals. NDP should be the leftist party, but they just have no vision. I am grateful for all the work they did on dental and pharmacare for the vulnerable, though.\n\nLong story short, for Canadians that believe in progressive values and respecting human rights, the current iteration of the CPC under PP have disqualified themselves. Carney is legitimately a strong candidate. So, I'll take it for now. If Cons want to win in Canada again, they are going to need to drop the culture war bullshit and be the socially progressive and fiscally conservative that the majority of CPC voters are anyway. We have a charter of rights and freedoms. If a federal party is showing they intend to impinge on our Charter and constitution, they are disqualified from my voting considerations.",
