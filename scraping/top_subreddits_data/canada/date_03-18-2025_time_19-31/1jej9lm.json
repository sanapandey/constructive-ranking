Not just factory workers but think downstream all of the parts suppliers, local grocery stores, transportation companies, dealerships and all of their employees, and so on. It's massive. Yes we'd benefit from cheap Chinese EVs but it would be at the expense of all those jobs. We don't have a thriving economy. We don't have tens or hundreds of thousands of vacancies that would just Hoover up those employees. It would be mass layoffs, skyrocketing EI claims, and a huge hit to our economy countru-wide. \n\nLike it or not we can't afford to do it. Allow BYD in? Sure. Zero tariffs and zero restrictions though? It would be apocalyptic.",
