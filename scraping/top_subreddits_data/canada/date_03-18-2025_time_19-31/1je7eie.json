The LPC was polling with majority numbers in the run up to calling an election and by the midpoint of the campaign the CPC was looking like they were running for a majority. Then things tightened up after the debates and in the end it was very close.   \n\nAlmost anything is in play in this upcoming election. It's Carney's and Poilievre's first campaigns so we will have to see how they do. I also think the NDP numbers could be quite volatile.",

Polls are nowhere near settling again and a recent one still had 28% of respondents saying they don\u2019t know enough about Carney.\u00a0\n\nElections matter. Kim Campbell created a 35% shift in the polls with her election to PC Leader and appointment as PM, erasing a 25% deficit to the Opposition Liberals. Then she ran a really bad campaign, with the end result being a 35% shift back in the opposite direction. And that infamous ad did not sink her campaign; it came in late when she was already -18 in the polls.\u00a0\n\nThe Trump phenomenon is new, but there are also several longstanding factors at play here that are almost certainly inflating the Liberals\u2019 numbers. New leader/leaderless bump, Trudeau gone, no platforms, national crises silence opposition leaders, etc.\u00a0",

I post historical things like what Diefenbaker did to scrap Avril Arrow and roll over to the US on our military manufacturing. Other similar things that can't necessarily be shown as partisan, even though they are. My personal page has been great for showing the ways Harper- and Poilievre as his mouth - tried to dismantle our impartial elections, dismantle our ability to hold foreign owned companies to account for their pollution while operating in Canada, and the removal of environmental protections on our water.\u00a0",

By entering the debate he gives Polievre the ability to try to shape what they learn about him.  By campaigning against Trump he sets his Pro Canada agenda and can ask questions like \"Why isn't PP pro Canada? Everything I am doing is pro Canada.  Why does PP oppose this?  Hmmm his plan sounds similar to something an American might do doesn't it????\"    Alowing Carney to begin to chip at that which is known or thought to be known.

I was amongst them. I probably would have voted liberal if they had waited until things had settled but since they called an election during a time that was really not safe for people to be going out, I specifically voted ndp. I suspect others did the same, or withheld their vote because they were trying to be safe. Liberal voters were the most likely to be upset by an election during the pandemic as they were the most likely to take the pandemic seriously. While conservative voters were more likely to be pandemic deniers and motivated to get out and vote against the liberals who they viewed as overstepping with pandemic measures.\n\nSo while I think things can change a lot during campaigns, I think calling an election now would cause anyone who would otherwise vote for Carney to turn against him. I don't think the shift would be quite as dramatic as the before and after the writs in 2021 unless Carney really fucks up.",

Equating *conservatism* with fiscal responsibility is asinine.\n\nBeing *fiscally responsible* would see things like better funding for mental healthcare and readily available treatment/housing for persons in active addiction/recovery. Why? Because it is *cheaper for taxpayers* than incarcerating them and/or providing emergency health services. It would be *fiscally responsible* to provide universal post-secondary education. Why? Because an educated populace has greater earning potential, and it would yield more tax revenue than it would cost. I could go on about *fiscal responsibility*, but the point is no conservative politician or party has these or similar *fiscally responsible* services as part of their platform.\n\nSo either fiscal responsibility is a dog whistle to conservative voters, or conservatives aren't actually fiscally responsible. My guess is your take on what fiscal responsibility means is much more narrow.",

As a member of that party from inception, I got to see relatively closely how much bureaucracy is involved to get a federal party started. It's not just what is required, but also the wait times from Elections Canada. Given that Brown's and O'Toole's respective views line up very closely with the CFP, it makes sense to join a party that already has basic machinery in place. This is why I think that the CFP is in a good position to grow in the aftermath of a CPC collapse. The federal Conservatives will have a tough time holding itself together after a fourth election loss in a row. The PC wing will probably no longer want to be weighed down by Reformers.",

It seems to me that under Trudeau, they could make the argument that Canada wanted change. But with Carney, and the polling shift that followed, it seems that the Canadian conservative movement in its current incarnation has failed.\n\nI'm sure they might try to bring back Harper or another personality-leader who might have a hope of reunifying the Reform and PC wings, but otherwise they need policy, and that policy needs to agree with Canadians if they want a chance at power.\n\nSo, going into another election, what policy could the Conservative Party present that they could market well to Canadians?",

Some of it is indeed original policy but there is also a lot of \"reverse the things the Liberals did and bring things back to the way it was at the end of Harper\" type policies.\n\nThat isn't necessarily a bad thing, I think we DO need to get our immigration policies rightsized and need to do better on crime (though the Provinces have a big role to play).\n\nThe gun ban/buyback stuff seems to just have been a Liberal wedge issue that  a few years hence 1) has pissed off legal gun owners, 2) doesn't really increase public safety and 3) is costing a lot of money. Reversing it definitely speaks to folks who are single issue voters on this policy. I wouldn't be surprised if the Liberals soften a bit here or at least cut the waste on the gun buyback program but not much has been clarified here by Carney. For average Canadians, this isn't a priority issue given the economy and tarrif/annexation item.\n\nOn taxes, I'm not sure how much a small tax cut would make a difference in terms of boosting the economy and Carney has already said he'd cut the propose cap gains tax increase. The carbon tax has already been cut for consumers and cutting it for businesses would be unwise given our need to align with European trade policies. That said, if the conservatives were clearer on the tax cuts and how they'd make up for that it would be attractive to some folks I'm sure.\n\nOn federal spending/staffing, it seems Carney has also already stolen their position on reducing headcount.\n\nOn child care and family planning, the conservative platform says they would bring back more tax deductions (good) but might look at cutting the childcare subsidy; they aren't super clear here. IMO, this would be very bad policy and as new dad to be, would almost make me a single issue voter given the impacts it would have on my family's finances (min $12,000/yr post tax delta is massive and the tax cuts/deductions needed to offset this would be huge). They would have to have very convincing tax deductions to change my mind.\n\nOn the environment, the isn't much there new from memory.\n\nOn military spending, they want to get to our NATO commitments (unlike Trudeau's latest statements) but I can see the Liberals and NPD making the same commitments now. It would be political suicide not to. The bigger question is on timelines and seriousness. I think Canadians will be very interested in seeing this.",

Especially when you've JUST barely left a trillion dollar investment firm. \n\nSo the immediate and clearest conflict would be if he pretends to now support pipelines in Canada, to deal with the southern threat, especially a new east-west line. That would sound good for western voters but there's no way that aligns with his fundamental beliefs or investments. It would be heresy compared to everything he's stood for up til now. \n\nAnd I would remind dear Liberal supporters that the very reason that Parliament is currently prorogued, is that the Liberals refuse to reveal where all the money went in their Green Slush Fund, even though ALL the other parties demanded they reveal it. Sustainable Development Technology Canada handed out 400M dollars and no one knows where it went. If we have a PM who STRONGLY believes in the same ideology we are very much in danger of seeing the same thing continue.",

If Carney has two debates with Poilievre and the worst that happens is that he's not very exciting, that's not going to hurt the Liberals much.\n\nBut Poilievre is not Freeland. Poilievre is really annoying and irritating. I think the worst danger to Carney is if Poilievre is super annoying and Carney loses his shit at him. That's a possibility.  All though if Carney goes apeshit on Poilievre, a lot of voters might feel that's actually a positive.",

Cheating can\u2019t outright be proven, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.  \n  \nBut in the words of Bernard Sanders (paraphrasing): the Democrats need to stop being little bitches and have a spine. Take a hard stance on something, rather than simply just relying on centre and centre-left people to vote for you because youre not Trump.  \nThe right wing exists mostly to \u201cown the libs\u201d, and they have extremely powerful solidarity. They don\u2019t give a shit about policy, and any policy positions they take a stance on are just them parroting talking points shoved down their throat.  \nConversely, leftist or \u201cprogressives\u201d have a much wider gamut of single issue voters that are dealbreakers. Two major issues for example would be Palestine and ACAB. Harris proudly said she stands with Israel and that she has literally 0 intention of \u201cdefunding the police\u201d. Just those two issues will be enough for some leftists to say they cannot vote for her in good conscience (despite the irony of people not voting for her being Pro Israel handed the keys to the man who wants to carpet bomb Gaza and throw up condominiums). If you Google \u201cNancy Pelosi\u201d there are entire websites, apps, publications and more *specifically* dedicated to \u201cexposing\u201d her stock trading activity. And while I\u2019m sure most GOP members are doing the same thing, it\u2019s on brand for them. Meanwhile, every time a gun is fired in America, Pelosi makes a dollar. Every time a gun is fired overseas she makes ten dollars. So, liberal-laced Betty Buttercup with her MA in Women\u2019s Studies decides not to vote for Kamala Harris (or Hilary Clinton, but voted for Biden out of pure necessity) because she wants to \u201csend a message\u201d to the democratic. Leadership. Poor Betty tho, has now witnessed the repealing of Roe v Wade and was unceremoniously terminated from her liberal arts job since her salary is grant-based, and gender studies is no longer a valuable skill anywhere and most of the work she\u2019s been doing is basically illegal now.  \n\n  \nThe part that really sucks for me is that nobody really hated Harris like they did with Hilary, who was arguably the most qualified person to ever run for the presidency. People actually HATED her, and the institution picked her because they knew she wasn\u2019t going after Wall Street. I still believe if Hilary won in 2016 we would be in a WAY better timeline. Putin was terrified of her.  \n  \nBut in that same way that folks threw their votes to Jill Stein because they couldn\u2019t support a Clinton, so many potential voters simply stayed home because Kamala had barely any policy plans and some of her policies were terrible nothingburgers. I\u2019m not an American, but I\u2019m a 36 year old who will never pay off his student loans, never own a house and weep for the state of global healthcare. The Democratic Party has 0 plans to improve my life in any way; and their plan is to just not make things any worse. It\u2019s always hilarious when they act shocked nobody showed up to vote when it\u2019s like - just do your fucking job. Get the corporate donor\u2019s cock out of your mouth.  \n  \n..  \n  \nIt\u2019s basically the same in Canada. Sit down and talk with a \u201cfuck Trudeau\u201d or \u201cfuck Carney\u201d person and they have 0 idea what they\u2019re talking about. They have solidarity. They don\u2019t need a reason to hate him, they just want to destroy wokeness. And it was working for a long time because Trudeau was so smug and detached from the reality of the working class.  \n  \nIt\u2019s all falling apart for the right now though..  \n  \nI am a lifelong NDP or Green voter, and abhor the concept of \u201cstrategic voting\u201d and FPTP, but I\u2019ll likely vote liberal in the next election because we need to cauterize whatever the fucking disease is thats spreading on this continent.",

He was the first non-British person to serve in that position since the BOE\u2019s founding in 1694. In March 2025 he was elected leader of the Liberal Party of Canada and became prime minister of Canada shortly thereafter.\nEarly life and education\n\nCarney, who grew up in Canada, earned a bachelor\u2019s degree (1988) from Harvard University, where his interest in economics was kindled by the lectures of another Canadian-born economist, John Kenneth Galbraith. He then studied economics at the University of Oxford (M.Phil., 1993; D.Phil., 1995). Prior to and following his studies at Oxford, Carney worked for Goldman Sachs, rising to become managing director of investment banking. While at Goldman Sachs he helped postapartheid South Africa gain access to international bond markets and advised Russia as it navigated a financial crisis in 1998.\n\nCarney was transferred to Canada in 2000. Three years later he was appointed deputy governor of the BOC. In 2004 he was seconded to the Department of Finance, where he implemented a policy to tax income trusts at the source. He returned to the BOC in November 2007 and took over as governor in February 2008. Unlike most other central bankers, Carney took immediate action during the 2008 financial crisis, reducing interest rates (by 0.5 percentage point) months before most other countries followed suit. In April 2009 he went further and promised to hold rates down for at least 12 more months in order to support the credit markets and sustain business confidence. As a result, Canada and its banks suffered less than the other Group of 7 countries, and Canada was able to return to prerecession levels of output and employment earlier than other countries in the G7.\n\nCarney\u2019s success, combined with his relative youth and accessibility to the media, made him something of a star in the normally staid world of central banks. He acquired international responsibilities, including the post of chairman of the Committee on the Global Financial System at the Bank for International Settlements (2010\u201311) and chairman of the Financial Stability Board, based in Switzerland (2011\u201318). U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne stunned most observers in November 2012 when he declared that Carney would succeed Mervyn King as BOE governor, marking the first time that a non-Briton was appointed to the position. The announcement, however, was generally well received.\n\nCarney faced numerous challenges in the post, taking over just as the United Kingdom\u2019s economy was showing signs of sustained recovery from the recession that had started in 2008. Carney quickly adopted the \u201cforward guidance\u201d strategy that he had applied in Canada\u2014giving the markets notice of the BOE\u2019s plans by affirming that, barring unforeseen circumstances, the BOE\u2019s very low interest rates would be maintained until unemployment in the United Kingdom fell from about 8 percent to below 7 percent. However, when unemployment dropped below 7 percent sooner than expected, there was concern about rising interest rates, leading Carney to announce that such increases would be limited. He later had to contend with the economic turmoil that ensued following the United Kingdom\u2019s decision in 2016 to leave the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d).\n\nCarney stepped down as governor of the BOE when his term ended in 2020. He was named special envoy on climate action and finance by UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, and he also held seats on numerous corporate boards. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Carney served as an informal adviser to the Canadian government under Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In September 2024 Carney was tapped to lead a Liberal economic task force in anticipation of the scheduled 2025 general election.\n\n**POILIEVRE**\n\nCareer politician (2004-Present) who studied international relations at the University of Calgary and thinks Justin Trudeau is a real turd.",

Scrapping it will make interprovincial trade more difficult, which is the exact opposite of what Poilievre claims he wants with his plan to tear down the provincial trade barriers. \n\nThere is also the fact that we need to diversify our trading partners, and if we want to start selling oil and LNG to Europe, like Poilievre claims to want, we need carbon pricing in order to do bussiness with the EU. If we do not have something like it in place the EU will charge a tariff to offset that carbon when it is imported. That raises the price and lowers demand for our goods. It also makes it so that that money generated by the tax on carbon goes into the EU rather than back in Canada. \n\n\nAs for the carbon tax raising prices, [the carbon tax impact on inflation was found to be negligible](https://irpp.org/news-release/emissions-pricing-has-little-effect-on-affordability/)",

It does. We're in really bad shape from it. Answer for the state of Canada (Immigration being the number one bad policy)\n\nWith Pollievre, I want to see him be more like Doug Ford where party lines are less important. I really do think he understands the assignment and has unfortunately gotten buried under this blanket hatred of anything vaguely right wing. He's still a good choice, but it's an actual alternative and not just anyone but Trudeau. I think had he been more vocal and visible the last few months, he'd still be the front runner.\n\nWith Singh, I hope he finds a dark hole to crawl into and vanish forever.\n\nEither way, I'm looking forward to where we go from here and it's a nice feeling.",

If in seat 2, Party A gets 20 votes, and Party B gets 200 votes, Party B gets 1 seat. They both have the same seat count, despite having different levels of support.\n\nThe Conservative vote in Canada is distributed very inefficiently - they typically get large majorities of the vote cast in rural seats, particularly in Alberta and Saskatchewan, but all those extra votes in the large majorities do nothing to increase the seat count, because those seats are already won. The Liberals, on the other hand, often lead by relatively small margins in the cities, where simply having more than any other party is enough to get the seat, even though the individual seat's majority isn't as large.\n\nCouple that with the different numbers of seats available, because most Canadians live in Ontario and Quebec, and the Liberals leading in Quebec, and being on par in Ontario (being on par leading to more seats because of the greater efficiency), the Liberals get a lot more seats there, and then in Alberta and Saskatchewan the Conservatives have a bigger percent number but relatively few seats because the entire Province of Alberta is only slightly larger than Metro Montreal. \n\nAt its simplest analogy: Leading dominantly in a small country bar (AB/SK) gets wiped out by being a somewhat behind in a thousand person nightclub (ON/QC).",
