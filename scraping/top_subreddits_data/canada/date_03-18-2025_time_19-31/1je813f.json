But PP was a close second, and a lot of people were just going to hold their nose and vote because it was a \"not Trudeau\" vote. \n\nIf Carney can come more into the centre, that's really what the country is craving. Not so much right versus left. A moderate centrist will absolutely kill it.",

I believe that he is made for this moment more than any of the other choices",

I don't think many people realize just how nice of a country we live in. \n\nI grew up in South America, and we lived in a nice house in a capitol city in a good neighborhood. We couldn't even rely on running water 24/7. Water would go out daily, so we had a cistern that we had to keep full. You also couldn't drink the water, so we had to arrange to have drinking water delivered. Security was enough of a problem that neighbors had to band together to hire a 24/7 security guard for each block. Smog was horrendous since there were no emissions standards.\n\nPeople who haven't spent time outside the country don't realize just how incredibly well this country runs, and the value that we get for our tax money.",

If you have coyotes, you may want follow up shots.  If you shoot a deer, the first thing you do is cycle your rifle and get on target as quickly as possible in case you need a follow up shot for a humane kill.  If you're small framed (I'm a smaller man, but this also applies to women hunting), a semi-automatic eats a lot of the recoil.  I'd much prefer to be able to use a semi-auto for hunting, but they added all my semi-autos to the list.  \n\nA ton of hunters and sport shooters are affected by this.  The shooting sport I used to compete in regularly is basically destroyed by this, others that I was interested in, same thing.",

It felt like the bitter remarks from someone who had just lost and was trying to justify it, not a politican claiming a mandate to lead.\n\nHeather Stefanson _lost_ in Manitoba, and gave an extremely gracious speech about how she and Kinew disagreed on things, but she knew he loved his province, and that his success was all Manitobans' success.\n\nGrace and class shouldn't be so hard to come by. It's wonderful to see it, and tragic when the opportunity to show it is ignored in favour of a cheap shot.

It\u2019s worth considering whether winning this war might be more important for now than CBAM. \n\nUnder CBAM, tariffs will start to be imposed in 2026. Do you think we will be in a position to greatly reduce our mining on minerals and the production of steel and aluminum for example? So that we can trade with the EU tariff-free? \n\nAll I\u2019m hearing is how the industrial carbon tax is important for trade with the EU, but little evidence to show that our carbon footprint will be reduced enough to be exempt from tariffs\n\nWe\u2019re both speculating here. I\u2019m judging by what I see from the U.S. and China and what sectors they\u2019re attacking, and what it will take to fight back. I\u2019m seeing a lot of trade between nations that will leave a carbon footprint, but what do we do? Keep the tax so it makes it more expensive for the importers? Allow CBAM to marginalize developing countries who may fail to be CBAM complaint by 2026? \n\nAgain, we don\u2019t have the data to accurately decide the right course of action, but given the context I think removing all trade barriers is important. Discarding the industrial carbon tax, for now, seems to be an obvious choice for how we can keep trade barriers-free and our allegiances strong",

This isn't a highschool popularity contest anymore. PP even mentioning to scrap the carbon tax at an industry level should raise a red flag. EU requires some kind of tax on carbon, whether it's done domestically by the exporting country, or by the EU on the exporter, if you want to trade to the EU. A tax within Canada on carbon keeps the money in the country, while still keeping the EU market available. Scrapping that tax will basically force Canada to rely on America. PP sounds like he wants Canada to serve USA to anyone who's listening to him.\n\nAside from that, Carney getting irrate I assume you are talking about the conflict of interest situation. When the guy is following the rules and still gets accused based simply on a report's disbelief that there could be no conflict of interest, that is every reason to be irrate. Was it the best response? No. Was it an understandable response? Yes. Anyone pointing to that as a gotcha moment is simply not thinking. He's there to lead a country, not look good for the camera as so many people seem to prefer the latter.",

They most certainly told us they were increasing spending, lol. She also became finance minister just after we went through Covid. She got to deal with insane Covid spending and massive inflation caused by the war in Ukraine and supply chains shutting down across the globe. I would be amazed if anyone could have balanced the budget during that time period. I don't see any of this nuance in your opinion, though. \n\n>She instead bluffed her way through the year and was going to get fired/replaced for being such a failure at her job;\n\nYou're not saying anything of substance, at all.

It shouldn't be that hard to pull a few examples. \n\n>nd was given opportunity to resign before that happened.\n\nWas she not challenging Trudeau at that point?",

Why is it that when Carney was Harper's Governor of the BOC...and Harper wanted Carney to become a MP?...PP sure didn't have much to say back then about Carney's inabilities.  I keep wondering how PP would perform on the world stage representing Canada...and all I think think of PP very awkward performance when meeting President Biden in Ottawa during his visit to parliament...so awkward that even Biden reacted to it.  PP just appears...shady...to me.  He hasn't spent too much time talking to us about his plan to deal with the tariffs all we seem to get is all these platitudes with no details.  And then he has an elected MP that is very good friends with JD Vance...Jamil Jivani..and when he had his radio show he showed his MAGA stripes before it was cancelled.  PP made it clear that he would choose party politics over Canada with his refusal to get a security clearance to find out who was possibly compromised in his party.  Did he already know who it was?  It all just seems so shady to me.  He might be a good PM for Canada but he is going to have to work much harder..and adult like... he should be able to highlight all his decades of government experience that will make him the best man for the job at this critical time to  convince me...us of that.",
