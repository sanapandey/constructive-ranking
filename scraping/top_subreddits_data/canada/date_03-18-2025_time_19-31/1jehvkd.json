What i want to know and am worried about...is how many Republicans would.\n\n> Also, CA\u2019s governor, Democrat Gavin Newsom, has been spending time with the likes of Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon\n\nDebating them is not \"spending time\". It is important to debate these people on topics when you know the facts are on your side. The reason why there are so many insane people on the right who are just normal everyday people is because they get stuck in these echo chambers and having conversations/debating these people were you challenge them is a way to pull normal people out.",
