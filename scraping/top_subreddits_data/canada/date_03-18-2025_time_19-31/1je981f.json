Life in both countries historically was very, very hard, so we're more open to helping the people around us when times are tough. There's no word for it I don't think in Canada, but in Australia it's called \"mateship\".",

We were taught to always stop and see if someone needed help, because if your car dies and it's -30C you might freeze to death. I visited over a decade ago and stayed in NSW. Australia is like Canada except you guys were smart enough to build good train transit for your country, whereas we sold out and just use it for transport/commercial. It is so dumb here, as I bividly remember living in Brisbane, taking a ferry, a bus, and a train to get to work doing demolition. I used the same pass for the train, bus, and ferry. Same pass could be loaded up and I could travel to another province easy. \n\nAnyways did you guys figure out how to make beer yet or is it still all VB",

The headline gives a misleading impression that Australia and Canada will work together for some sort of joint defense system. What is actually happening is Australia is lending expertise and technology so that Canada can install the same type of systems that we do. \n\n> Interesting to partner with Australia on this though;\n\nIt makes sense. Both our countries have northern regions with a climate so hostile that it is sparsely populated, and so vast in size that the curvature of the Earth becomes a significant factor. Both have the North as the only border that isn't flanked by oceans or a friendly peer nation with similar culture (well the Yanks used to be friendly). \n\nhttps://www.dst.defence.gov.au/news/2023/03/21/story-behind-jorn-%E2%80%98we-young-guns-were-going-make-good-we-could%E2%80%99#:~:text",

The technical ones are that we\u2019re quite good at radar and sigint technology, we\u2019ve been working with it for many decades and learning along the way. We have a good system of installations that are being upgraded as we speak so perhaps there is some technology sharing as part of this. Our stations are very good at long range surveillance and of very small objects in the sea/sky, taking advantage of installations in our vast land expanse with very little human made radio noise (similar to your arctic lands). We\u2019re also no stranger to extreme cold operations due to the heavy Antarctic science station presence\n\n\nBut I think the more important point is the political reasons. I\u2019m guessing this is our way of publicly standing with you guys without expressly saying so, much like the UK, France and king chuck are doing. I\u2019m personally glad to see this, we love Canada and Canadians, and are so sorry these awful bullying events are being done to you nice and decent people. I\u2019m in awe of the strong stand your people are taking to this, and hope to see you bring all consumer, business, travel and services spend on American items to precisely $0 very soon\n\n\nVIVE LE CANADA \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6",
