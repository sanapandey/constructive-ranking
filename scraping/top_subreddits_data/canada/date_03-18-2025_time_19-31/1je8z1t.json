To voters the guy looks like he has contempt for the country he claims to want to run.\n\nOn top of that, he's a **conservative** and in the western world pretty much every successful right winger that pulls in moderate votes has this oafish buffon/strongman type aura (Trump, Ford, type). Like the football player or popular kid archetype rather than the sneering nerd sitting at the back of the room raising his hand and telling the class how much he hates them.\n\nDoes this have nothing to do with policy? No. Does it actually matter for votes? Unfortunately yes.",

I think a lot of people scapegoated immigration and heavily exaggerated its affect on affordability. It was a factor, but it was one of many. People seemingly forgot that we just got out of Covid and global supply chains shutting down, a massive rise in interest rates, and the fact that our housing market had long hidden its gross unaffordability with low interest rates. Although the Liberals made a lot of mistakes, they at least seemed like they were willing to admit it after a while and make necessary changes. I prefer policies like the housing accelerator fund to removing GST on new home purchases, and I still support Carbon pricing rebates in some form while maintaining industrial carbon pricing solely on producers. However, I was never against carbon pricing to start, so I dunno.\n\nI'll also note that I have never voted Liberal and have voted since 2011. Carney might be the first time, but I also hated Poilievre before Trump, so there is that. Granted, I wouldn't have voted for Trudeau if he had remained PM.  Carney seems to be willing to go a lot further to the center than Trudeau, which is not exactly a selling point for me but seems reasonable at the moment given the circumstances we're in. So, I think there will be substantial differences in economic management under the Carney.",

The conservatives are never going to win with a MAGA North candidate, Conservatives don\u2019t need to be left, they just need to be left of *that*, which isn\u2019t really hard as it is what the Conservative Party has always been in the past. Poilievre is an aberration, and the Conservative Party needs to see this as the failed experiment it is, if they double down on his kind of insult and slogan right wing garbage their numbers are just going to keep falling.",

If I was to give the CPC some advice, it might be to get some meat on their policies, or update their policies to get deep support.\n\nWhat this says about a huge chunk of the Canadian population, I'm not sure. It might suggest that its somewhat true that the Liberals are the \"naturally ruling\" party of Canada, with policies that deeply resonate with Canadians. So maybe the Libs should really figure out some internal cleanness cycle so they don't have to bounce to the other guys before getting back where they belong.",

Sure, he didn't win the election, but the cons did reverse a massive polling lead by the Liberals. Pivoting to the centre was a really smart move that allowed him to distance himself from anti-vax groups and undermined the Liberal's attempts to turn the election into a referendum on Trudeau's handling of the pandemic, which most viewed positively (especially compared to America's response). Discontent with those measures did later propel Poilievre to the leadership, but if he tried to run on anything close to that in 2021 he would have been falling right into the Liberal's trap. He was doing so well for most of the year because he's been talking about affordability more than courting conspiracy theorists.\n\n  \nI think you're on point about the next election though. This is definitely an outlier, and will only be a delay if Carney can't turn the economy around before the next election.",

Most Conservatives have thrown their support behind him because he emerged as a star and voiced Canadians\u2019 frustrations, and a rhetoric of attacking Trudeau resonated with how a lot of us felt.

If Trump doesn't happen, I bet Carney still has an impact but we're still likely cruising towards a conservative majority, or at worst, a minority. Doug Ford came out hard against Trump and just won a landslide in Ontario, there's proof of concept here. \n\nMeanwhile, Polievre was pretty quiet around that time, and his only responses that he had were just focused on the same messaging he had before (bring back parliament, aXe ThE tAx, tAx CuT, wOkE), mostly not calling out Trump, still talking about Trudeau, and even adopting GOP messaging on the border. Him being endorsed by Musk and people like O'Leary doesn't help either of course, but I think it'd be less relevant if sovereignty wasn't potentially in question due to Trump",

He's not stepping down (right now) BECAUSE he's putting country before party. He realizes the NDP has zero chance of forming a majority this election no matter who is leader and that between PP and Carney, Carney is the best choice for Canada to stand against Trump.\n\nBy doing what he's doing, support is bleeding from both Conservatives and NDP to the Liberals, greatly increasing the chance they form government and now making a majority not only possible, but perhaps likely. They were also able to push through some of their policy that never would have happened under the Conservatives. \n\nIf Jagmeet were to step down now, that would interfere with Carney's momentum. If a popular NDP leader were chosen, it's entirely possible vote splitting would hand the Conservatives a majority. \n\nAs soon as the election is over, unless somehow the NDP end up with a historic performance, Jagmeet will announce he's stepping down.",

Modern LIBeral is not about LIBerty.

The change in polling is a) people don't vote for change in wartime, if they agree with the war. Trump is obviously the primary reason we're seeing this. To the extent our liberty/sovreignty is threatened and we're considering needing a strong *military*, today's LPC and certainly the NDP are the absolute last parties we should be looking to. Trudeau had Anita Anand running the military. I didn't feel at *all* safe from a \"my liberty is threatened\" perspective under the LPC. They've been way more focused on modernizing/nicifying our military (at least the bad parts of it) than on building it up and making it strong, or passable.",

Before WW2, he was basically a failed politician, a conservative and imperialist in an era were imperialism was out of step with the electorate. Yet with the rise of Hitler, he succeeded in articulating and setting the public mood of the UK of defiance, where other politicians failed.",

This is without any rebates, and with families in some provinces facing costs as high as $1157.  The PBO\u2019s past analysis has shown that the vast majority of Canadians already are further behind, net any rebates they may get, based on the first carbon tax.\n \n**The PBO reports that the combined impact of both carbon taxes will result in an additional 61 cents per litre of gasoline once fully in effect. The first carbon tax will cost 41 cents per litre, the second carbon tax 17 cents per litre, and with 3 cent per litre GST added on, it will all add up to a total of 61 cents per litre.**  GST on these carbon taxes is nothing more than a tax on a tax.\n\nHere's the PBO report if you want to slog through it: https://www.pbo-dpb.ca/en/publications/RP-2425-017-S--distributional-analysis-federal-fuel-charge-update--analyse-distributive-redevance-federale-combustibles-mise-jour",

Its currently $80 per tonne. By 2030, current legislation says the tax is set to reach $170 per tonne of CO2.\n\nThe price impact of the carbon tax on fuel depends on the carbon content of the fuel. Gasoline and diesel have different carbon intensities, meaning the amount of CO2 emissions per liter of fuel varies. Gasoline typically emits about 2.31 kg of CO2 per liter. Diesel emits about 2.68 kg of CO2 per liter.\n\nSo, to calculate how much the carbon tax increases the price of fuel, multiply the carbon content by the tax rate. For example, at a tax rate of $170 per tonne, you would:\n\nFor gasoline: $170  per 1000 kg \u00d7 2.31 kg CO2 per liter - $0.392 per liter.\n\nFor diesel: $170  per 1000 kg \u00d7 2.68 kg CO2 per liter = $0.456 per liter.\n\nI assume MP Gray's comment on the \"first carbon tax\" refers to the economy-wide carbon tax covering households and most businesses, while the \"second carbon tax\" is from the Clean Fuel Regulations which mandates fuel companies reduce the carbon intensity of the fuels they produce. As far as I know those standards are still in effect having come into force on July 1, 2023. \n\nIn any case, the $0.61 per liter number represents an estimate based on the full $170 per tonne carbon tax scheduled for 2030 as proposed.\n\nWhatever Mr Carney signed it hasnt changed any legislation. Yet. He can do that once Parliament is back in session if he's serious, but so far what he's signed is a promise to go back on a fundamental principle of his entire career. Sorry if Im a little skeptical that's actually what he intends to do or that the deck won't just get shuffled and the carbon tax will be hidden from view, as he's already advocated for a \"shadow carbon tax\" Its been the primary focus of his career to use carbon taxes to kill anything carbon emitting.",

Basically we should subsidize families until the birth rate is stable. It's shown that women tend to want kids when they're around other women with kids or who are pregnant so that's something that'll happen naturally, no need to force anyone nor should we want to.\n\nAs for the people who don't want families or kids, welp they're free to leave the gene pool I guess.",

They will paint him as having his ideals in every decision and that they supported his vision for Cabinet, and argue now that he is out, MPs will have more autonomy and be able to govern by more of a collective.\n\nWe will see if that resonates with voters. But there are only so MPs to choose from for a cabinet, and experience does matter, so Carney didnt have much of a choice to bring in a new cabinet.\n\nOn another note, PP saying that 100% of the cabinet comes from Trudeau's caucus is one of the more silly things I have heard thus far.

Let's all not forget that he was Trudeau's economic counsellor during much of his tenure as PM (during which our country's public finances were pretty much driven off a cliff). Was he giving Trudeau bad advice or was Trudeau not listening a word from him ? \n\nI think the next election campaign is going to be pretty interesting !",

Less regulatory burden will lead to increased competition and lower prices for consumers.\n   - Trade Policies: A strong emphasis on trade and open markets is common, with free trade agreements with countries around the world that will benefit Canadian businesses by allowing them access to larger markets.\n\n4 Pro-Business Environment\n   - Investment Growth: Policies aimed at creating a favorable environment for businesses, including reduced corporate taxes and streamlined processes, are posited to attract both domestic and foreign investment.\n   - Job Creation: The party will focus on creating jobs through support for industries, particularly in sectors such as natural resources, manufacturing, and technology.\n\n5 Energy and Resource Development\n   - Resource Management: Conservatives will reverse the terrible policies of the Virtue Signalling Champagne Liberals opening up the importance of Canada's natural resources and advocate for their responsible development, arguing that will ABSOLUTELY drive economic prosperity and create jobs.\n   - Energy Independence: Support for energy projects, including pipelines, to support the economy and will lead to regional job growth.\n\n6 Emphasis on Innovation and Technology\n   - Research and Development: Conservative platforms will include investments in innovation and technology to stimulate economic growth and make Canadian industries more competitive globally.\n   - Support for Small Businesses: Emphasizing the role of small businesses as job creators, Conservatives shall definitely advocate for policies that provide support and resources for entrepreneurs.\n\n7 Welfare and Employment Policies\n   - Encouraging Work: Conservative policies focus on job creation will lower unemployment rates by promoting initiatives that encourage workforce participation rather than dependency on social programs.\n   - Social Services Reform: Reforming social services will lead to a more efficient allocation of resources and greater incentives for individuals to work.\n\n\nConclusion\u2026..\nThe Conservative Party principles and policies will create a more robust economic environment, lead to increased growth, and improve the overall prosperity of Canadians.",

Who's falling for internet memes here?\n\nBack then, you claimed \"every news outlet in your country bombarded you with false information to elect Clinton\"\u2014which is ironic, considering that the biggest culprits of disinformation were right-wing media giants like Fox News and Sinclair Broadcasting, the very group that forces its local news anchors to read pre-written, pro-corporate, pro-Republican scripts.\n\nAnd now, you're pushing another oversimplified, corporate-friendly narrative\u2014that deregulation magically benefits everyone and that the U.S. economy is some paradise where people pay \"far less money to live.\" Just like your media takes, this is pure ideological nonsense that crumbles the moment you look at reality:\n\nDeregulation doesn\u2019t lower costs for average people\u2014it raises them. Look at what happened to utilities and rent in places that gutted regulations.\nAmericans do NOT pay less overall. They get nickel-and-dimed with medical bills, predatory loans, and hidden costs that don\u2019t show up in tax rates.\nThe U.S. dollar is strong for reasons that have nothing to do with lower taxes. If low taxes alone made a country rich, then why isn\u2019t Somalia an economic powerhouse?\nYou weren\u2019t making good-faith arguments about media bias six years ago, and you\u2019re not making a good-faith argument about economic policy now. You\u2019ve just switched from ranting about \"left-wing media\" to selling the same free-market fundamentalist BS that corporations love\u2014because it convinces regular people to vote for policies that screw them over.\n\nthis one of your comments: \"Not American, but from an outside perspective I do agree that Americans seem to be kind of full of shit here. Your entire country has one, count em, one major news station that is not blatantly left wing. Americans didn't seem to care too much about the unbelievable media bias during the election, that even went as far as collusion with the democrats, but this is what freaks you all out?\n\nCome on guys, get a grip. If you weren't scared by a blatant attempt by every news outlet in your country bombarding you with false information to elect Clinton then why is this so scary\"",

Yes, Canada absolutely has these problems\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean right-wing policies will fix them. The core issue isn't whether these problems exist, but how they got worse and who benefits from them.\n\nCorporate deregulation, tax cuts for the wealthy, and austerity measures (all key conservative policies) have been shown to worsen these issues, not fix them.\nyou imply that \"since the left hasn\u2019t solved these problems, we should try the right,\" without any critical evaluation of whether right-wing economic policies would actually help.\nThat\u2019s like saying a bad doctor couldn\u2019t cure an illness, so we should try poison instead.\n\nNow you are going to try and misrepresent the argument/debate?\n\"At what point are we supposed to be results-oriented when we vote? Your main points seem to be exclusively theoretical, but every measurable standard of living has been steadily declining in Canada over the last decade.\" - This misrepresents the debate by suggesting that left-wing policies are only \u201ctheoretical\u201d while right-wing solutions are \u201creal results.\u201d\n\nThe real results of conservative economic policies (both historically and in other countries) show that they often exacerbate inequality, erode worker protections, and increase corporate power.\nPrivatization and deregulation lead to higher costs for essential services (e.g., healthcare, housing, education).\nCorporate-friendly policies don\u2019t solve affordability issues\u2014they increase profits at the expense of workers and consumers.\nYes, Canada has problems\u2014but the conservative solutions are not \u201cresults-oriented\u201d fixes, they are ideological shifts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy.\n\nThen you try and ignore context - \"Should we not value the actual results of where our leadership has gotten us vs theoretical arguments of how you assume left/right wing economic policies will work in a vacuum?\" \nCanada\u2019s struggles with housing affordability, stagnating wages, and corporate greed aren\u2019t unique\u2014they are global trends tied to neoliberal economic policies (which conservatives overwhelmingly support). The question isn\u2019t \u201cHas leadership failed?\u201d but rather \u201cWhat policies are actually to blame?\u201d Right-wing governance in places like the U.S. and U.K. hasn\u2019t solved these issues either\u2014it has actively worsened them.\nIn short: Blaming the current government doesn\u2019t mean conservatives have a better solution.\n\nAnd now here again you try and passive aggressively deflect: \"Also on all the other nonsense above that, I'll take your word for it I suppose.\" - This is a passive-aggressive way of refusing to engage with the actual discussion. Instead of addressing points, you dismiss them as \u201cnonsense\u201d without argument. This is a common bad-faith tactic: Avoid engaging with evidence. Pretend the argument is beneath them. Act like they\u2019re being \u201cforced\u201d to accept something\u201d rather than actually countering it.\n\nWhich brings us to your strawman and attempt at tone policing: \"I\u2019m not desperately scouring through people\u2019s profiles, that includes mine. I always wonder how you people function in the real world. If you get into a discussion with someone about something, do you ask for their reddit username and stand there in silence reading years\u2019 worth of their comments to come up with a point? Very bizarre behaviour.\" - This is tone policing and an attempt to reframe the debate as \u201cweird\u201d rather than engaging in actual discussion is just plain fucking weak sauce man.\n\nIf someone contradicts their past statements, pointing it out is fair game.\n\nIf someone has a pattern of bad arguments, their past statements provide important context to understand whether they\u2019re arguing in good faith. Deflecting with \u201cthat\u2019s weird\u201d doesn\u2019t actually address the substance of the discussion. It\u2019s a lazy way of dodging accountability while making the person calling them out look like the unreasonable one.\n\nAgain I repeat - I am having a blast calling out this bullshit and pointing out you are just a shitty person.",

While the article doesn\u2019t measure IQ, its focus on absolutist tendencies could hint at a cognitive profile consistent with lower verbal ability among PCA advocates.\r\n\r\nPCA is linked to a \"spiral of silence,\" where dissent is stifled, and open debate is replaced with conformity to a dominant ideology. The article cites survey data showing 60% of 500 students felt pressure to conform to PC norms, often enforced by administrators.\r\n\r\nThis could imply that PCA thrives in environments where verbal sophistication (e.g., articulating dissent or engaging in abstract reasoning) is devalued.

You switch in a phased manner and the entire world is shifting in this direction. And China being the largest polluter doesn't mean we do not have responsibility to clean up our mess. We are also larger contributors per capita than China. China also manufactures a lot of things for us thus we have essentially exported our pollution.\n\n>Even if Canada achieves zero carbon emissions, China will offset it in less than 1 year! I am not saying \"we should pollute our oceans and land\" just don't go overboard on zero carbon emissions\n\nWe all gotta do our part. And we need to do it in a phased and thought out way which is what Carney has always been proposing.\n\nNow going back to your original comment since you have completely deflected from your original comment.\n\n>Carney is very pro-climate change already\n\nNo he wants to prevent climate change\n\n>said he supports the Carbon tax he will unfreeze it once the election is over\n\nHe did not say this and he did not say he will unfreeze it once the election is over. He said we need to keep it for industrial producers because EU and other economies require it and if we don't tax them at home, the EU will tax them when we ship to them. So better for us to collect that tax.\n\n>he will tax Canadian steel and aluminum because \"its bad for the environment\"\n\nHe did not say this nor is it his policy.\n\n>as well making construction even more expensive\n\nAgain this is based on a false premise\n\n>he supports affordable \"container\" homes \n\nOk.",
