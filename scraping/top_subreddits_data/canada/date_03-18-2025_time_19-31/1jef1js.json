In the U.S.A., movie stars are like Gods, they have award shows, stars in a pavement and advertisements to make additional money. Average people lose their minds with actors, and they can't tell the difference between someone who acts for a living and some character on screen. They already do not have the ability to think about anything other than what they see directly in front of them. The most thinking they do is what to have to eat, which makes them very, very easily manipulated.",

Actually enjoyed the show.\n\nTrump was by far the worst part of the show, but that was okay as he seldom made appearances. In the episodes he was involved with he'd hawk his steak or mattresses and at the end in the boardroom he'd be capricious and random, basically just throwing a dart and eliminating someone. His observations and inputs were worthless, and he seldom even seemed to know what was going on.\n\nWhen he was absent and it was Caroline (his underling) or even his daughter Ivanka, it was infinitely better. They actually asked cogent questions, made useful observations, and so on.",

Specifically in 2016 and 2020. \n\nIn 2016 I saw nothing but Bernie Bernie and more Bernie here in the state of California. Rarely did I ever see a Clinton bumper sticker. During the Democratic primaries, it was clear he was the winner. But he... Lost California? Because Clinton got the super delegates. It was all over the news she basically won because the Super delegates favored her over Bernie. Now I'm no expert in politics but it was very clear from the get go the DNC wanted their pick and not ours. Maybe I'm mistaken but in 2016 and 2020 people wanted Bernie way more than Clinton and Biden just judging by what I saw in the state of California alone.\n\nKamala was actually a decent choice but Biden completely killed her chances running again when he shouldn't have and basically made her campaign start way after it should have. \n\nPeople are stupid here and want their what I call \"faction\" or honestly it's a cult, to win cause \"God says so\" and it pisses me off. \n\nNow I'm not saying everyone lost hope but if you notice a lot of people have a mentality of \"my vote doesn't matter\" and it's clearly showing in our elections. Now basically our elections are being decided by billionaires, cults, and whoever can shout the loudest. It's upsetting and I am sorry that the orange man is being mean to our northern brothers and sisters whom I've never had a problem with \n\nAnyway... Just do me a favor my Canadian friends...
