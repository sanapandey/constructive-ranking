There is no way in hell the Republicans allow 40 million (slightly to) *highly-left-leaning* people to gain citizenship!  No way in hell.  \n\nAnd, not just that...  With Canada in the electoral college (as 1 or more states), that ruins the Republicans' structural advantage in every election.  No more winning elections with a minority of the popular vote.\n\nAs such, they'll never allow any of it to happen.  Ever.\n\nLike always, this is extortion.  Trump threatens something HORRIFIC.  Something that he can actually do (with the flip of a switch, he sabotaged Ukraine's ***entire*** Kursk operation and handed the territory back to Putin on a silver platter).  Then, you'll panic and give him whatever he wants.  \n\nMexico just caved.  Ukraine just caved.  Everyone caves.  Because Trump's insane and corrupt enough to do these evil things.  He just killed all the Ukrainian soldiers in Kursk - and Ukraine is his ally!",

But not in the angry / super defensive way he used to when he first started it. It's been almost a week, but the last time he said, \"They would be the greatest state. They would be paying lower taxes. I love the Canadian people, I have lots of friends in Canada.\". \n\nVery different tune. Even Rubio has taken a very different tune since that G7 meeting last week.

Carney already received a commitment to come to our aid from EU. \n\nNow, if he waits a few years, then we're more hosed as that would be him waiting for Russia to build up the forces to do some incursion into the EU, chances are he would do this in concert with Putin since it would negate our allies from coming to our aid as they'd be busy defending the EU. \n\nAll of this hinges on him actually managing to pull any of this off though, Putin is highly unpopular in the US still with the non-MAGA types, Canada is also highly popular.
