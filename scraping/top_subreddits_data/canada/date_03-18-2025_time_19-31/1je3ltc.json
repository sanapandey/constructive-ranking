            "body": "At this point, I expect he'll finish in Iqaluit, fly back to Ottawa to formalize the plans for dealing with Trump, make some blunt announcements, and then call the election. I'd have preferred he call an election right away, but he's basically clearing the board of the Trudeau vibe and staking out a tougher position for the country, and then using that as a foundation to run on. I'd be upset except the government's ability to react during an election will be limited, so it's better to set some parameters now, so Trump (and the world) know what our positions are.\n\nPolitics aside, this is a good and responsible move by a new PM during an international crisis. But there's limited wiggle room before it starts to be election campaigning before the election's called, so he'd better be careful.",

I thought I saw an article a day or two ago saying that the election date will almost certainly fall on April 28 or May 5th. \n\nHe only became the PM last week. He'll likely call an election within 10 days of being sworn in. Seems reasonable to me.\n\nEdit to add the source article I was thinking of:\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mark-carney-charles-tupper-shortest-prime-minister-1.7484061\n\n> Given that Carney is expected to call an election before March 24 \u2014 the day Parliament is set to return \u2014 it's possible that he could have a shorter time in office than Tupper if the Liberals lose the next federal vote.\n\n> Sources speaking to CBC News have pegged April 28 and May 5 as two likely possible election days. That would mean Carney would have between 46 and 52 days as prime minister before the vote.",

I think all are fairly plausible, but the trick for him is that he needs to be visibly spending these days doing something that feels overtly Prime Ministerial, as opposed to \"Leader of the Liberals\"-ial. As soon as he tips into something resembling campaigning with one of these appearances, that sense of reasonableness will burn off quick with the changeable voters. Conservatives will complain regardless, but the squishy middle will look at a trip to the UK, or France, or Iqaluit as important moves to guard our sovereignty, and give him a pass. But the longer he pushes it, the greater the chance he slips up and gives the whole thing a less-noble hue.",

I think the odds of an average Carney policy being overtly partisan are much lower right off the hop, plus he has enough low-hanging fruit to work with that I imagine he can make it through a week without getting his proverbial dick caught in the proverbial ceiling fan. If he can't he probably shouldn't be PM anyway.\n\nTo me the bigger uncertainty and risk with Carney is how they manage the fact that he's (as far as I can tell) not a great *politician*. He's wildly competent and has strong opinions, based on that competence, about what needs to be done. He's at his most compelling when they let him cook, but on the other hand he's also likely to make some gaffes or get prickly in doing so. He's a doer, not a talker, he's used to operating in certain echelons, and he doesn't suffer fools. That's a fine line to walk--will his gaffes and snippy responses be compelling and endearing and contribute to his aura, in the vein of Chretien, or will they do the opposite and leave him open to being decimated by the Con attack machine, in the vein of Ignatieff?",

I mean, once the election is called, the likelihood of gaffes goes up exponentially, but for this next week, he has the chance to make a mark as a PM that people will remember when it comes time to mark their ballots. It'll be interesting to see if his novice-politician instincts can get him through unscathed.",

And if there is one thing Poilivere is good at doing its getting under someone's skin. Trudeau mostly avoided that by simply reiterating his last statement three times in the House without actually answering a question. Im not sure Carney's sensibilities will allow him to do that and as much as his team is going to be silently biting their knuckles and chanting \"Dont take the bait!\" in their heads, I think Carney gaffes are inevitable, especially during a debate. \n\nIt remains to be seen how much that will mean to voters, but it will definitely play a role in Canadian's decision to lead a country...especially when we know the person who is most likely to really rankle is the President.",

Calling the election sooner helps bolster his \"get shit done\" credentials (which these trips are part of) -- even if it's just 2 or 3 days early -- but waiting until Parliament resumes means he might be able to get the NPD, Bloc and Greens to support a symbolic resolution to take a hard stance against Trump and pledge to help Canadians. That would force the CPC to either support it or appear disloyal, which would be an *excellent* way to head into an election.\n\nBut if he does delay until then, he's going to have to have a jam-packed schedule of counter-Trump events, or the stench of pre-election electioneering will overpower whatever he's saying. I'm not convinced he can maintain this energy that long without making a mistake, but I guess we'll see.",

If you really think people are strategically voting against Conservatives in this election strictly because of \"Wokeness\" then you shouldn't be criticizing people for \"believing misinformation\".  \n\nI don't believe the Conservative party has the skills, or the tools to survive the current trade war with the United States. We will need to create strong ties and deals with our other allies which the conservative party will not do. They continue to platform on non-issues with no plan on how to combat the USA except to hope that they stop if we continue to give into their demands.\n\nWhile I don't know for certain what will happen either way whichever party wins, I believe our Economy and World Position will be worse off under the current Conservative Party. They can talk about \"Common Sense Politics\" all they want, but politics is not common sense, and they continue to rarely actually give a plan of action, over pretty words and slander campaigns.\n\nThe Conservative party would have been way better off keeping Erin O'Toole. He even had the Majority Vote in the last election.",

Its a none partisan role, chosen by the BOC's board of directors and rubberstamped by the PM's cabinet. \n\nThe bank of Canada's mandate is to control inflation. They can do this by controlling interest rates, and the money supply. You may be more familiar when Tiff Macklem adjustable rates right? Well the BOC also sells and buys bonds. When they want to increase the money supply, they sell bonds and when they want to reduce it they buy them.  This is called quantitative easing. This is what Carney was responsible for, and to his credit he did a good job predicting what rates were needed, and he sold alot of bonds to provide a needed cash infusion into the economy. \n\nThe problem is that it is the minister of finance that creates the budget. They allocate money to each department, and choose where the money should be spent. IE the 800 million dillar stimulus they passed. Jim flaherty nailed it with spending it where it was needed. He also made the banks pay back every penny they used for the bail out; while limiting spending in areas that while vital were not as much of a risk to the economy. This financial event was the worst downturn since the great depression. So its a much more complicated job than the BOC governor, and has a much more significant effect on the economy. If Carney deserves 10% of the credit, Jim deserves 90%. The problem is that Carney was taking most of the credit. \n\nAs far as the paul martin thing, that's an entirely different issue to begin with.  In the 90's due to high spending from Trudeau the first, the country began to run out of money.  Mulroony didn't do the greatest job managing the debt, and didn't male the difficult cuts to pubkic service that was neccisary. What happened is that we got close to defaulting on our foreign debt in the early to mid 90's. That would be really bad, and make it harder to borrow money in ths future. Paul Martin became a folk hero because he managed to balance the books. Carney claimed he helped Paul Martin do this in the leadership debate, but it turns out he didn't start working for Paul Martin till the early 2000's, long after the budget was balanced. \n\nI hope this all makes sense. I'll acknowledge the rest of what you said, but I have to start my day and don't have time to debate it. \n\nLikewise! This is what I like about being Canadian. We can disagree politically and still be friends. In America they would just as likely kill each other. Ot makes me proud to be Canadian. So thank you, I'll appreciate you as a fellow Canadian.",
