Their design will diverge a bit from the animated version to make them more practical to wear, but I\u2019m aiming to still capture the overall look!",

In order to get the right color and make the surface more matte, I did a series of light paint layers. So I can see through a bit, but can only make out vague shapes and sources of light. Most of my visual actually comes from looking straight down my nose. It\u2019s enough to get around without bumping into stuff, and it slows me down so I end up feeling more in character :)",
