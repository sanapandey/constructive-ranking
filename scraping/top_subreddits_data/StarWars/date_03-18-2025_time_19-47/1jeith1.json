It\u2019s also why ghost Yoda can summon lightning while on the island as well.\n\nThat said, this is just my headcanon. I agree that letting Force ghosts interact with reality kind of breaks the narrative in weird ways, as you suggest. Why wouldn\u2019t Force ghosts just face down these threats in a physical way instead of imploring folks who are alive to do it?",

It's the thesis of a significant portion of the trilogy.\n\nChange comes (and it always will) but it need neither replace nor erase the old. In the scene where Luke lifts the X-wing, we see a changing of the guard and an overt message to the older audience. The wonder and awe that caused a generation to love Yoda, is passed on to Luke, transforming his narrative role. Here Luke's character arc completes and he takes the place of Yoda as the old, wise master, passing on his knowledge to a younger generation. While his time in the spotlight comes to and end, his story doesn't. He continues to exist, both materially and through his legacy, as the old Star Wars doesn't simply cease to exist, and in universe as the Jedi themselves, as well the hope and idealism they represent. It's also used in the same way to place Rey in the shoes of a younger Luke (and every other hero before them both). Now she is the young learner, amazed by the possibilities she didn't know existed, both as a character and as a stand-in for the audience. Now Rey begins her journey to hero and master of the Force. Now Rey stars in the films, the books, and the comics that little kids mimic in the playground. Her rescuing of the old teachings as the older generation frets for their possible destruction, is the symbolic and literal carrying on of the old ways, as it influences and inspires, creating a new perspective for a new viewer. The old teachings, like the old movies and their messages, don't end, they just change hands. This is the final thing Luke \u2013 and the audience \u2013 must learn.\n\nTo the younger generation without the context of the older, she is what Luke was to us. To the older generation, with the history the younger lacks, we get to see the light in the eyes of our kids when they see Star Wars for the first time. We see them learn to love this strange Luke character as much as we adored the fascinating Yoda. In this way, it also places us in the shoes of those that came before us, such as our parents. It's a wholesome little thing, that.\n\nAs an aside, it seems key that much of Kylo's narrative is the opposite, and it only brings him misery and ruin. Unlike the the changing of the guard we have with Rey and Luke, which ultimately welcomes growth and evolution, Kylo's obsessed with replicating the past, causing him to repeat all of its mistakes. He refuses to let go, he refuses to change, and he refuses to let the old be the old. He wants it to be like it was. But change comes.",
