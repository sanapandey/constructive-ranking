If anything, he would've been even more shocked and taken aback by the betrayal due to his connections with the clones, that they might've killed him without much of a fight.\n\nThe Clones themselves would probably hesitate a little, and officers like Wolffe would probably shed a tear similar to Rex aboard the Venator, but I think the hold of the chip would be too strong.",

The problem being that between the chip and the order they, at least in the moment, truly believed that the Jedi had committed treason and were an *immediate* threat on the battlefield.

Only if you watch extra kids cartoon shows, you get a whole bunch of lore and retcons to fill plotholes from the movies. With how big some of the TV show characters got, and how important they became to their causes, it seems really weird the the first few films are SO quiet about them. Not one rebel is like \"What about the Ghost crew?\" or \"Are the Inquisitors still a threat?\" - anything like that would have been best and added wonder for a while, but Lucas had no idea, just like us.\n\nThere are a few other scenarios in the stories of Star Wars that suffer in ways from retconning/revamping the lore. \n\nWe saw Maul get cut in half, and the main threat of the movie is eliminated. We'd never seen anyone survive that (it was like what Qui-gon got but 50x worse) or seen such extreme cybernetics as his rebirth (until Gen. Grev.) and he's not mentioned ever again in any trilogy despite *surviving* ruling a crime syndicate. Obiwan could have said something about Maul, and other threats from the empire/dark forces when he and Luke hang out. \n\nWe thought Luke was bringing about the Return of the Jedi, because they were extinct, but turns out there was Ezra, Sabine, Cal? (haven't played the games, probs some more lore retcons in those), and hundreds of others running around at the same time. \n\nWe thought Anakin would bring balance to the force, and never thought it would get un-balanced again.\n\nWe thought Palpatine died.",

That never bothered me because Yoda and Obi-Wan are not omniscient and weren't always the most honest about details in those movies, but I understand the complaint there.\n\nAgain, point to a specific point where any of that should have been said. The ghost crew has zero reason to be mentioned in 4 or 5, and it seems likely that they weren't working as a singular crew by 6. The inquisitors stopped being a threat halfway through Rebels, before the OT. No reason to talk about them, especially when Vader is a much bigger concern.\n\nMaul is iffy, but take that up with Lucas. Legends also had other people survive worse injuries with the dark side, but that's also outside the movies. \n\nLike I said, limited information. The Jedi that Yoda knew of in Rebels (Kanan and Ezra) are either dead or in another galaxy, and I didn't see a tv to watch Cal in the news. Obi-Wan might've, but who knows. I understand not liking that more survived, but you're extremely exaggerating the issue with \"hundreds of others running around at the same time\". There absolutely weren't.\n\nPalpatine coming back is bad, though Legends had the same issue.\n\n\n\nSo, was this all a vent? I didn't say I don't understand people having a problem with retcons in general, just specifically Ahsoka being Anakin's padawan and not being mentioned in the movies. Most of this had nothing to do with that",

She'd also have to get there somehow, since I don't think Vader would be so obliged to take her prisoner alongside Luke on Endor (which also wasn't pre-planned, so Ahsoka probably wouldn't be there anyway). \n\nThe Ghost ship could've been there, but I doubt they'd amount to much more than a cameo like in Rogue One. It's just one ship out of many.\n\nNobody is contesting that they didn't exist yet. Obviously things could gel smoother if they had at the time, but as it stands, I just don't see these things as stuff that SHOULD have happened. Could they? Yeah.

But on the other hand, Anakin\u2019s unorthodox way of doing things and getting solutions for problems is what made him a better Jedi than others thought and by extension, Ahsoka. Giving him an apprentice also added some depth to him in TCW and gave him a sort-of younger sibling at the time, something he never had, and their relationship feels just as much like that. So her being directly connected to the main character of the prequel trilogy gives us a stronger emotional connection to them than with another character. \n\nIt also makes later scenes with the two of them emotionally hit harder, specifically in the season 2 finale of Rebels when Ahsoka is dueling him as Vader on Malachor. Plus, it also hits extra hard at the end of the Fugitive Ahsoka arc in TCW when she leaves the Order and Anakin, and he was one of the few who openly stuck up for her, whereas the rest of the Council didn\u2019t.",

That's simply not true. And you aren't even using plot hole correctly anyway. Ahsoka existing isn't a plot hole since they already gave us story reasons for her absence during ROTS.\n\nAnd I, along with many others, would argue that TCW was one of the biggest contributors to the rehabilitation of the PT in the fandom. It gave the clones depth that wasn't there. It helped make Anakin's fall to the Dark Side feel more earned. It gave the fans connections to a great many characters we didn't have before. There's a reason that a lot of people are asking for a similar show to exist for the ST. It did a lot of good for that era of Star Wars.\n\nBut again, I wasn't even trying to argue against your point except to say that the use of the term \"fanfiction\" doesn't make sense as a criticism of TCW (it doesn't make sense to me for a derogatory term for anything but that's a different conversation). It's cool that you don't like TCW but you are in the minority there. Which is also totally fine!",

Ahsoka existing but not being talked about in the scenes we see in the movie isn't a plot hole. It would be if we knew she was doing battles with Anakin during the events of the movie but somehow wasn't a factor otherwise. But she wasn't. She was on Mandalore at the beginning of RotS and Anakin had a lot of his own shit going on. \n\nWe know she's working with the Rebellion during events leading up to the OT and then the events of Rebels happened. What she was doing between that and Ahsoka, we don't know yet. But again, a character not being mentioned when it wasn't established that they were there isn't a plot hole. If that was the case, is it a plot hole that Shara Bey isn't shown on screen during the OT? There are plenty of characters that we know exist that don't get mentioned because they didn't exist when those movies came out but just as importantly, the story created for them makes it so they weren't relevant to those plots so they don't have to be mentioned.",

We never see them using orbital assets to soften up landing zones or suppressing the enemy. They rarely utilize any starfighters or LAATs for air support during ground battles. There is a distinct lack of artillery support during offensives. At least they occasionally utilize armour to spearhead ground assaults.
