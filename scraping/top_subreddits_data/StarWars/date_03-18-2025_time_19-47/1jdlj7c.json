Because her \"good\" character really didn't add up.\n\n\nShe could have been like \"this new republic sucks, this psuedo rebellion sucks, this new empire sucks, I'm taking over. And nobody is powerful enough to stop me. And Kylo? He wants dis ass.\"\n\n\nEvil. But more Grey than black and white. Rey, the Grey ?Jedi/Sith? hybrid. (take out G, her name was meant for this).\n\n\nBut because its Disney. They couldn't do that. Disney, by being Disney with its Disney values, ruined Star Wars.",

His parents are slaves, there was no indication that he would be for sensitive, much less extremely for sensitive.\n\nSimilarly the character Rey could have been a true nobody but ended up being a Palpatine.\n\nThe reason this matters is that children watching these movies could imagine that maybe they could find out they are for sensitive or even a chosen one like Anakin even though their parents are not Jedi or Sith or for sensitive or anyone in particular.\n\nAnna can become somebody. He discovers his force powers. But we are talking about family lineage here. That\u2019s a totally different thing.",

The issue we are talking about is whether he represents a nobody or somebody from a known for sensitive lineage.\n\nMy point is that he doesn\u2019t have a known force sensitive lineage. His mother was a nobody and the force chose her to have a fourth sensitive child. That means it could happen anywhere and any child could\u2019ve been Born to a mother chosen by the force.\n\nMore importantly to the story, that means that it\u2019s highly likely there are force sensitive characters in families that are not previously known in the SW stories.\u00a0",

The force can be and is everywhere. I, personally, feel it matters more that the Jedi come from nothing or nobody. Coming from force lineages leaves an impression that it \"belongs\" to only a certain few. Sabine is someone we see go from someone with virtually no force connection to a potential Jedi, a story we were denied with Finn even though he admitted that he was force sensitive in a scene that felt very ham fisted. That implies power is not just for the powerful, but that it can be earned, and if the force really flows through all beings in that galaxy, then it cant deny anyone who works towards embracing it. It also feels like this is something the Sith hold to in a very destructive way, in so much as they'll sacrifice others for power and gain, but theyre all about power for those who would take it and no one would be denied.",

It\u2019s hard to know what to do with that information for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s never elaborated on. How did it happen? Has it happened before? Was it part of a prophecy? They\u2019re just isn\u2019t a lot of of context.\u00a0\n\nSecond, there\u2019s plenty of evidence that other high force sensitive characters are not born By immaculate conception so There are clearly other ways.\n\nThird, there are other examples of \u201cnobodies\u201d Meaning people without any clear family history of for sensitivity developing force powers. For example at the end of the last Jedi, there was a character named Temiri Blagg Who was a kid who worked in the stables who was shown to move a broom with the force. I believe that this was included to show that people without a bloodline of for sensitivity it could also develop these powers.\n\nFourth, we are kind of trusting that Anakin\u2018s mom is accurately reporting events. This could be an Untrustworthy narrator situation.\u00a0\n\nPersonally I think the \u201cAnakin had no dad\u201c idea reminds me of so many other stories that shoehorn in some religious iconography to give their work a little more gravitas but it doesn\u2019t contribute meaningfully to the story. For example, I think the matrix would\u2019ve been just as good without all the Christian iconography.\u00a0",

He was chosen by the force and conceived by immaculate conception etc. however this conversation focuses specifically on family lineage and from that perspective, he is nobody we are describing nobody as anyone without parents known to be for sensitive.\u00a0\n\nWhy does this matter?

Because Star Wars is trying to figure out whether they are telling a story about a handful of special families with force sensitivity Or if they are telling a story about a universe where anybody can be force sensitive. They seem to be waffling on this point a bit, with some evidence that anyone can develop force powers Out of nowhere but on the other hand they keep telling stories about the Palpatine\u2019s and the Skywalker\u2019s and Skip opportunities to introduce a wider range of four sensitive characters.\u00a0\n\nThe Rey story was the most confusing in this regard since she went from nobody to Palpatine which I think narrowed the SW universe.\u00a0",

Luke and Rey appeared to be unconnected people from the perspective of the audience or a random character who didn't know who they were, but other characters in the story knew their actual backgrounds tied them to powerful dynasties.\n\nAnakin was born with vast potential, but absolutely nobody knew about that before he was discovered by Qui-Gon Jinn.\n\nI seriously can't understand why y'all are arguing about this. Are you *offended* that a major character is being labeled \"a nobody\" or something?\n\nIt's simply a description of the initial social state of the character. It says absolutely nothing about his potential or what he did later in the story.",

Though it is true that Obi-Wan was watching over Luke *precisely* because of whose son he was and got him involved for that reason, while Rey getting involved in the story was more happenstance (or \"the will of the Force\" if you prefer).\n\nI'm not 'offended' by any of this. If anything, its the people arguing that Rey *should* have been a 'nobody' who are offended by the idea of her being related to a powerful or significant character (which is actually par for the course when it comes to the Star Wars franchise).",

Though I guess the idea was that the *protagonist* was a 'nobody'.\n\nTo be honest, there is a bit of a real-world political aspect to this...a lot of pushbacks (mostly on the left, but even to an extent on the right) against the idea of 'elites', family bloodlines and legacy. \n\nBut Star Wars has always been a story that incorporated such ideas (along with other ideas about anyone, even 'scoundrels' like Han and Lando, becoming heroes). What Rian Johnson tried to do with TLJ was pushback against this ethos by taking apart from the established dogma of the Jedi Order *and* making Rey a 'nobody' with no special bloodline. Fortunately or unfortunately (depending on which \"certain point of view\" you hold), JJ Abrams did a course correction in TROS by making Rey a Palpatine, and making the Skywalker legacy central to the story again (wasn't it also just before TROS that the films were rebranded as the 'Skywalker Saga'? Can't get more family/legacy focused than *that*).",

What making Rey a nobody did was allow the main character of a Star Wars film to be unrelated to a special family.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you think about Star Wars films up to that point, you had the original trilogy (Luke, his father, his sister, his future brother-in-law) then the prequels (Luke's parents). The Force Awakens was entertaining in a way, but it was so overwhelmed by nostalgia for A New Hope that it was almost a remake.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen The Last Jedi subverted expectations by not making Rey a Skywalker it felt like throwing off that nostalgia for the past, allowing Star Wars to tell a story that wasn't about Luke and his relatives. It said, like you did, that anyone could be a Jedi. More importantly it said that one of those billions of people unrelated to the Skywalkers was interesting enough to make a film about.",

Sure there are family names, but Rey should have been her own person. \n\nMy stance about episodes 7-9 is Disney really screwed over the new characters by not making them cental to their own series of movies. And relied too heavily on the OT characters to carry it all.  Cameos sure thing, making them all main characters just ruined it for me. It's like trying to make a series for a new generation. But making sure to have all the references and nostalgia throwbacks that new fans won't even understand. \n\nLeia should been chancellor and only seen in address the republic, Luke should have been in a holocron that Rey and Finn(yes I think he was force sensitive) while they tried to learn from the jedi through fragments they find. Han, Lando, Chewie, 3PO, and R2 could simply return to help facing the new order after the 5 planets are destroyed. Leia was lost after all.  \n\nSee there I go again rewriting movies. I've been a star wars since I was a kid, and just wish disney let creatives do their thing, rather than churn out product with the idea of, what do people know about this franchise, then hire a hack who starts it off with a remake of A New Hope remade with today's technology.",

But the two don't mix well *at all*.  \n\nPersonally, I far prefer Rian's style and would love a larger Star Wars tale (I'd prefer to move beyond trilogies) told by him.\n\nI think the biggest flaw is that TLJ seriously departs from TFA in stylistic terms, and TROS straight up ignores the vast bulk of what TLJ was doing.",

That being said, I love it. I understand wanting Finn to do that. The problem is that TLJ takes place about a day or two after TFA and Rise a year later and during that time they\u2019re running all over the galaxy being pursued. Finn as a Jesus like figure causing uprisings doesn\u2019t do it for me. And it\u2019s cliche. Clearly the FO would crack down and they did. Also, he did inspire people to rebel, see Jannah. Also, the Resistance a la Rose et all taught him not to run, and to face his fears",

I still love them and I do think the sequels will really have their time just as the prequels get love now. But it will always being a little jarring how the sequels are set up to me. I get not liking the idea of him striking multiple rebellions but I think one large scale one wouldve been more interesting than the small scale one with Jannah maybe flesh her character out further and have them work together to reach their former comrades. One of the scenes I loved that was deleted in the last Jedi was when Finn exposed phasma to some of her troops and they then on her. I think what makes the idea interesting to me isn\u2019t that Finn is the savior rather that he isn\u2019t unique, not just one of a few anomalies among storm troopers, any other trooper can defect like him they can go against their orders. I do appreciate that he fills the hero role more as the movies went on he is not a horrible character by any measure, but I think he had much greater potential than he reached.",

Its fair to say that if Abrams had done TLJ it would have been an ESB reboot. As it is, Johnson's version ended up being one as well, albeit a lot more subversive (so instead of Rey being revealed to be someone's daughter, she's a nobody).",

The actual identity of her parents does not really matter *to Rey* except briefly in TLJ, and it's then resolved when she makes her choice to go save her friends.\n\nThe way the \"mystery\" is set up in TFA has fuck all to do with Rey as a character.  It's entirely about hiding the ball from the audience while saying \"Look!  I'm hiding the ball!  Bet it's impooooortaaaaaaannnnt!\"  But it isn't.  It's just a mystery designed to create audience engagement with the material that's something other than, you know, telling a good story.  When we get to TLJ, that's actually the first time where the identity of her parents is made out to be important *to Rey*.\n\nRemember that prior to TLJ, we have no reason to think that *Rey* doesn't know who her parents are/were.  Her question is more about why they abandoned her and whether they'll come back, which is the first hurdle in her undertaking her journey (her reluctance to leave, lest they return some day).  They're a convenient excuse for her to stay put.  BUT, in TFA, there's no reason to think \"Rey doesn't know who her parents are!\"  That's entirely a construct for the audience, and then only because we don't see them and aren't told anything about them.  Information is withheld (or unknown to the writer, most likely), and so we say \"OOOOOOOH I'LL BET THAT'S IMPORTANT\" and start spinning up theories about how she's a Kenobiwalker or whatever the fuck.\n\nIn TLJ, that's the first time where the actual identity of her parents matters to her, and then it has more to do with that answer somehow providing her with a path forward, or rather a reason not to choose for herself.  Ben senses this desire in her, and tells her she's a nobody (which is ironic, because I get the sense that Ben wishes he came from nothing himself, but that's a separate discussion).  And the problem is that answer doesn't tell her what she wants (which is, again, a path forward).  When she goes into the cave, and asks who her parents are, the cave just shows her endless rows of herself.  Why?  *Because it doesn't matter who her parents are.  She has to choose for herself.*  Which she does, thereby resolving the internal drama.\n\nNone of this invalidates TFA's setup.  To the contrary, it's the first -- and most important -- time where it actually grounds the issue in the characters, rather than it being a little candy for the audience to try and unwrap.\n\nI'll even go as far as to say that, while I find her being a Palpatine to be deeply fucking stupid and retrograde, the strength of TLJ's writing is that it doesn't diminish her character or her choice in that moment.  Without the knowledge of her parentage, she chose.  She took up the mantle.  She said \"I'll take on this burden\" and that's what made her a hero.  Not her parentage, not her rejection of the Sith, not her sacrifice at the end.  What mattered was that when she thought she was a nobody, she still said \"It's my responsibility.  I'm stepping forward to do this\" anyway.\n\nI think it'd be better if she *was* a nobody because it'd keep that choice consistent, and underscore the \"Anyone can make a difference\" message of TLJ, instead of the elitist \"You have to have special genetics\" message of TROS, but at least her act of choosing is every bit as heroic regardless of how later films turned out.",

Making a true and positive character like Rey just having the background as the daughter that was sold by filthy drug dealers is just not credible. A kid like that would have been damaged before their departure and lost all faith in humanity.\n\nSo, first, I think it's worth remembering that what Ben tells her is...just what Ben *tells* her.  That doesn't make it true (as TROS later confirms).  Even before TROS came out, I had a hunch that this was Ben trying to fuck with her.  She could be a nobody, she could be the daughter of space vagabonds, she could be the daughter of some great legacy.  It didn't matter.  What mattered was that she chose her path, and it was that act of choosing that really made her the hero.  \n\nThat said, I don't think having a \"nobody\" is somehow unworthy in this series.  In fact, I think it's an incredibly powerful message that anyone can make a difference, and it doesn't matter what your background is for you to do so.  Rey being a nobody would play into that.  She could still be the \"Chosen One\" (in the sense of the Living Force \"choosing\") without coming from some famous bloodline.  Plus a lot of what the fans speculated/seemed to want was that she come from an *already known* famous bloodline (e.g., she's Obi-Wan's granddaughter!  She's Qui-Gon's long lost grand-niece!  She's Yoda's clone! You get the idea).  This, to me, is the height of \"fan myopia\" where fans often cannot think beyond established material, claim that's what they want, and then end up unsatisfied when they get it because it's \"just more of the same\" or something.\n\nI think a better sequel to TLJ could've made clear that Ben's statement was only partially true and mind-games (e.g., her parents sensed her power, were being chased, and left her to keep her safe or something, but weren't junk traders who traded her for a case of beer and a pack of smokes), but still retained her \"nobody\" status and the story would've worked great.  Making her a Palpatine was just...dumb.  \n\n>Finally The Force Awakens was filled with questions over who she was and where her parents were, not the least by herself talking to Han and BB8.

But the vast bulk of those questions do not matter for the *narrative* of the film itself.  Like, how'd Rey know how to fix the Falcon?  How can Rey understand BB8?  Why did the sabre call out to her?  None of that actually matters to the characters or for the events of the story or for resolving the central dramas of the film.  The film doesn't *make* them matter, either.",

                            "body": "One point to elaborate.  You could imagine a world in which the implied and explicit questions actually *do* matter if you want to see why that *don't* matter in TFA.  For example, the question of \"Why does the sabre call out to Rey?\"  (I mean, other than \"Duh, she's the star of the new trilogy.\")\n\nYou could answer that question in a way that ties to the plot, to the characters, or to both.  For the plot, let's say Maz explained that the Living Force chooses a champion in times of great need, and that choice can manifest in many ways, like a powerful Jedi artifact calling out to the new champion.  Maz could say that she thinks the sabre chose Rey because Rey is the new champion.  There.  Mystery resolved, AND it matters to the story and the events of the story.  \n\nOn the character side, you could've had Rey continuing to hear the name \"Luke\" in her mind, over and over, before this, and have that become even more pronounced when she touches the sabre and has her vision.  But the vision scares here!  She sees how Luke suffers as the last champion, she watches the destruction of the Jedi temple/training academy/whatever at the hands of Kylo Ren, and thinks about how she keeps hearing this voice say \"Luke, Luke, Luke.\"  So, she says \"Maybe I'm not the champion.  Maybe I'm just the messenger to bring this sabre to the true champion.\"  And now the \"Why Rey\" question matters *to Rey*, because she's trying to sort out whether she actually is the champion or is just a servant of the Force or whatever.  So, the question could then remain unanswered or at least ambiguous, but the \"why\" has a reason for it *that matters to the plot and now to the characters*.  \n\nNow, I'm not a screenwriter, and I'm just throwing stuff together in, oh, 5 minutes on teh intarwebz, but my point here is that that's a way to make the answer to the question matter for the events of the film, or to the characters (or both).\n\nBut here's the thing: neither of those things happens in the film.  \"Why'd the sabre call Rey\" is more a mystery *for the audience*.  Or, really, it's just hiding the ball and not providing the audience with full info, leaving them to speculate *as if* it's a mystery.  \n\nSame story with her parents.  Rey doesn't care who her parents are in TFA.  She just wants them back, and that desire holds her back and binds her to Jakku, which provides drama for her character as she is drawn away from Jakku by events.  You could've made her parents' identity matter to the film if Rey, for example, believed them to be one thing, but learned they were something more, and discovering the truth about them would, in turn, resolve some dramatic tension for Rey or guide her actions.  Or you could ground it more in the plot where, in the course of discovering the truth about them, Rey's actions serve to resolve some tension within the plot.  Like, the plot is about finding a macguffin (e.g., \"The Crystal of Revelation\" or whatever), and learning the truth about Rey's parents is how you find the crystal because...uh...I dunno, they were treasure hunters or archaeologists or whathaveyou.  Now *who* they were matters to the *story* and to Rey as well.\n\nBut the film doesn't do that.  It just...withholds information, insinuates larger reasons for Rey's power, doesn't provide explanations, and calls it a \"mystery.\"  It's bullshit.  It's just meant to fuck with the audience, and it doesn't matter *for the film*.",

Its not about 'diversity' - its about deeper messaging. \n\nAbrams with TFA was doing a legacy sequel to the original Star Wars films with a character who's effectively 'next in line' after Anakin and Luke. Its about the galaxy looking for its great hero - Luke Skywalker - and in the process a new hero emerges as a potential successor to Luke (perhaps in more ways than one).\n\nJohnson wanted to subvert that with a message of \"Let the past die. Kill it if you have to\". It was all about subverting and, in some cases, *destroying* the foundations built by the Star Wars franchise thus far. Luke's legacy is one of failure, as is that of the Jedi as a whole. Rey is a nobody, but this nobody will usher in the new era of the Jedi/Rebellion/franchise. Oh, and apparently, the Rebellion and the Empire/First Order are equally bad (though this aspect wasn't given more than a cursory examination). At a deeper level, it was Johnson making his trademark 'anti-Establishment' message by striking at the Establishment of the Jedi, Luke Skywalker, the Rebellon and the Star Wara franchise.\n\nI'm not saying TLJ was a bad film. Taken by itself, its a pretty good film, potentially even a great one. But in the context of the larger franchise, I can understand completely why so many fans see it as the abberation, and TROS as the solution (however flawed).",

Obviously forums such as Reddit gives a skewed image as it pertains to a very small subset of the population with an average user age of 23, so most here didn't even see the prequels at the theater and although they are serious fans, the chronology may not be as important. Still, why is it such a liberation that the main protagonist was a 'nobody' in a story that the creator himself said was about Anakin Skywalker and his offspring. Especially when we've already spent years following Ashoka in her own story.\n\nTLJ is in my view an odd duck. No it is not a bad film per se, and it certainly has some of the most beautiful and interesting scenes, and yet it was disastrous for Star Wars. From Han Solo's smart ass humor and sarcasm we won't fully Monty Python slap stick with fake prank calls and Luke throwing away his light saber in the most anticipated scene ever. In my view, without knowing the man, it seems to come down to Rian Johnson's low self esteem. I guess he is a small nerdy guy and it just felt that for him personally it was important that the main hero was someone like the rest of us, an inconsequential nobody that rise to the occasion and is allowed to play in the big league. Johnson also had to make this his own thing, beyond the main cast he killed off everything that had been set up in TFA; Snoke, Phasma, Rey's heritage, he completely sillified Hux and treated Poe like a five year old. After this he created his own hero and main character Rose, in an already very busy cast, and set her off on an adventure completely unrelated to anything else in the trilogy, and one that in the end resulted in nothing.\n\nJust like Abrams is labeled as being a mystery box filmmaker, Johnson is the subverter. However, while it is a misunderstanding in the former it is actually very true in the latter. There was no way Johnson could live with most people guessing after TFA that Rey was Luke's or possibly Obi-Wan's relative and then just present that. This guy has such a chip on his shoulder that serving what people expect and what makes most sense is beneath him. He had to create a twist even if it wrecked the story. Same thing with the Knives Out franchise. Entertaining but in the end, if you know there is going to be a twist, is it still a twist?",

To your point, consistency is key - the fact that they setup a mystery as to her past (potentially including her parentage) and then TLJ is like, \"Nope! That whole mystery doesn't matter! She's nobody!\" only to have ROS be like, \"Wait! It DOES matter! In-fact, she's a Palpatine!!\" is a shitshow. They needed to pick a direction and STICK with it. \n\nFor me, the mystery box was less about whom were her parents (though Ewan McGregor doing the voiceover largely did indicate SOME sort of link, and one could be forgiven for assuming it was a genetic one), and more about her abilities and lack of struggle. My theory at the time (and honestly it's the one I still think would have been best) was that Rey ended up on Jakku because she was Luke's last surviving student and he placed her on Jakku to keep her safe while putting mental blocks on her memories and training. And the \"Force Awakening\" she was having is because those blocks were fading - hence her lack of struggle to gain her skills. She didn't need to gain all of her skills because she already had them - she just needed to remember. \n\nWhether or not she was genetically related to one of the main characters, or if she was just a \"nobody\" ultimately should have been irrelevant. My issue with it at the end was ALWAYS that she just got her abilities because she's some sort of chosen one - there was never any real struggle in her story.",

Rey had no connection at all to Obi-wan (after the events of the next two movies played out), and Obi-wan never again voiced anything to her.  \n\nThat's why I say it makes no sense now in retrospect. I think it was setting it up that Rey was a descendant of Obi-wan, and then that thread was abandoned. Looking back at interviews, after the first movie Daisy made a comment that she thought that it was obvious who her parents were, and then later mentioned after release of RoS, that the Palpatine connection was something that was decided on at last minute. Those two statements point to at least a change in the character's background - at least in the perspective of the actress and potentially the direction/backstory she was given.",

I don't know what Abrams was thinking setting her up like a pure Luke female version, dressed the same way and having the same positive demeanor and innocence. All while all marketing was asking \"Who are you?\". Luke's lightsaber was calling for her and lets face it, most of us was expecting this trilogy to be about Anakin's grandchildren as this was what Lucas wanted, and that would have made most sense in terms of being a proper ending to the Skywalker Saga.\n\nNonetheless, this was not to be. When Luke's lightsaber called to her and Maz told her that her parents were never coming back but that there is someone who could, Rey answered Luke. But why would Luke be there for someone he didn't know about? And when Rey fights Kylo in the forest we hear Obi-Wan's voice saying \"These are your first steps, Rey\", which also doesn't make any sense if he didn't know her. Why would she have an awakening? This never happened to Ashoka or anyone else, unless something was triggered in her force sensitivity and someone like the force ghost of Obi-Wan felt it as well (Luke was shut off).\n\nRey being a girl on her journey to become a Jedi, and not being a Skywalker but becoming one, has roots in discussion before The Force Awakens. We know that because the young girl's journey comes directly from George Lucas himself and her becoming a Skywalker, sort of by honor or adoption, was discussed at a writer's meeting in 2014. It also makes sense that Lucas would approve or be part of these ideas since he himself have adopted children.\n\nStill, questions abound. If this was the plan all along why would Abrams be visibly frustrated by Johnson declaring her a nobody? He said in an interview after The Last Jedi that he didn't believe audiences would be satisfied by wondering for years who Rey was just to be told it doesn't matter. Abrams therefore clearly thought it did. At the same time there were according to the actors various ideas being thrown around during The Rise of Skywalker, which would either indicate the parental character Abrams originally had in mind was no longer available or that he felt that after the reception of TLJ that her bloodline had to be explored more. Who knows, perhaps it was Palpatine all along and he was playing games with Daisy Ridley and the others to keep everything secret, fresh from a near disaster when Boyega left a script at his hotel room.\n\nBut storywise, as a fan who saw Star Wars in the theatre at the time, the most satisfying for me would have been if she was Luke's daughter with someone he met and had a brief fling with, and never knew had a child. Someone who understood his commitment to the Jedi order and therefore wouldn't tell him, but who at the same time realized the explosive nature of a child that was the last Skywalker, and eventually had to take the most difficult decision to hide her without any trace.",

Making her a Kenobi for instance would have made things too complicated at that point, especially since Obi-Wan hadn't even been mentioned in the sequels thus far.",

They know people like Order 66, Boba, Palpatine, Vader, and so on and so they flood their shows (except for Andor) with cameos and nostalgia bate.

She repelled down. Picked up a part , got some food for it has a big stick. Hits people with it and then automatically knows how to fly the Falcon.

Why wouldn\u2019t the ultimate hero be the grandchild of the ultimate baddie: Rey, the granddaughter of Sheev. \n\nLuke and Rey\u2019s stories are pretty much identical.

She started as a nobody, discovered her identity, and then chose to live how she wanted: as a Skywalker. That\u2019s exactly what Luke did.

But he was a special farm boy. His dad was a Jedi (which at the time ANH was written he wasn\u2019t Darth Vader either. Just a dead Jedi) but obviously it all developed as it did. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone can claim Anakin was a \u201cNobody\u201d as he was always written through the lens of becoming Darth Vader. Yes he was a slave from nowhere. But the indication given in TPM is that those who are force sensitive could quite easily tell he was something special. \n\nInitially when TLJ came out i liked the idea that Rey was a complete unknown. She wasn\u2019t a chosen one or a Skywalker/Palpatine/Solo/Kenobi/Bezos her parents were no one and nothing. Just like I\u2019m sure 1000s of Jedi before her. But she got wrapped up in this generations old family struggle and fell under Luke and Leia\u2019s wing and earned her place as a Skywalker (potentially reviving what we once knew as Jedi as the Skywalkers) I like that as it subverted the original expectation that everyone had. It came out of left field and as I\u2019m sure someone else said. The scene at the end with the kid and the broom cemented that. \n\nI just wish they\u2019d stuck to it. Not retconned the shit out of it as they did in TROS either that or they should have let JJ do the whole sequel trilogy so 9 could conclude what 7 & 8 gave us instead of trying to go back and change it all",

In this version, Luke never tried to kill his nephew. Instead, Ben initiated his plan to kill Luke, his wife, and his child in their sleep. Mara Jade wakes up as Ben looms over lil Rey. She engages Ben. She\u2019s more skilled, he\u2019s more powerful, it lasts only a couple blows, then Luke is up. Luke just utterly wipes the floor with Ben, but the sound of ships landing and battle catch everyone\u2019s attention. The Knights of Ren, Snoke, and some troopers have landed. Luke tells Mara to flee with the child, and to warn the students as she goes. He promises he\u2019ll see them again.\n\nLuke gets Ben down, and then Ben pulls a \u201cGreen Goblin (think Sam Raimi\u2019s Spider-man).\u201d People who know the character: what is Luke\u2019s most defining characteristic, which happens to be exploitable? Compassion. \u201cUncle, it\u2019s Snoke, he\u2019s in my mind, he\u2019s too strong.\u201d Luke puts his guard down, reaching to help his nephew up and comforting him, then Kylo collapses the room.\n\nMara flees in a ship while being chased by the elite Knights of Ren (in this universe, they\u2019re dark Jedi, and there are more than a handful of them). Snoke cries, \u201cI must have the child! Bring her to me!\u201d Mara briefly loses them, maybe with the help of someone like Maz or even Lando, but she knows it\u2019s only a matter of time til they find her. And no one, but perhaps Luke, can resist a mind probe from Snoke, so nobody, not even allies, can know where Rey is. Mara leaves Rey on a backwater with people with no connection to her, knowing the force will guide Rey. She flies off and \u201caccidentally\u201d bumps into the Knights of Ren and Kylo Ren again, making them chase her. She ensures that the chase ends with a dog fight, that results in her ship exploding, now she cannot betray her daughter.\n\nLuke senses the end of Mara, but knows Rey is alive. He leaves an incomplete map, knowing the only one who will find him is Rey. He also knows he cannot confront his nephew. His anger would be too great, but also, he cannot bring himself to kill his family (as shown previously). No, Rey is his only hope.",

            "body": "People don't like this answer, but Solo is the only correct answer. Before anyone freaks out, having a Nobody is a great story. It's just not great for the trilogy of trilogies in the Skywalker Saga.\n\nAs many of you know, each film is made of three acts. Each trilogy is made of three films. The three trilogies create the Skywalker Saga.\n\nHaving Rey be a Nobody would be like the third act of A New Hope introducing Red Twelve, a random Force-sensitive character, who comes in and blows up the Death Star.  The audience would go \"Whaaa?\"\n\nOr, in Return of the Jedi, a random nobody came in and started fighting with Luke and Vader as Palpatine watched.\n\nThe division, and why this split the fan base, is that half the people want this continuity. They want a space soap opera like the original trilogy. Brothers and sister and fathers and sons. The other half want something new more than they want an established storytelling arc. That's fair, by the way, but if you order Star Wars/Pizza, you might be craving pizza. Even if someone hands you expensive sushi, some people don't like sushi. It's arguable better but sometimes you want the comfort of pizza. The other half is like \"Hell yeah, I paid for pizza and got an amazing sushi boat!\"\n\nIf Rise of Skywalker leaned into Solo, we would have had brother versus sister. Each born to two of arguably three major bloodlines in the series (Solo and Skywalker, with the other being Kenobi.) That's peak Star Wars. Instead, we go the worst of both worlds: Vader's grandson vs Palpatine's granddaughter. That's why it's so meh.\n\nThe main reason people want Nobody is because the Palpatine angle sucked. Again, I'll repeat that a Nobody trilogy would kick ass. But if we ended with a final showdown of light versus dark with brother and sister of a Solo/Skywalker (Kylo) and Solo/Skywalker or Solo/Kenobi (Rey), audiences would have eaten it up.  I think a vote for Nobody is really more a vote for \"Ugh, not what they gave us. Not like that.\"\n\nSo, yeah, I hear you: You want Star Wars to grow up and be more like sushi. But that's why we have Rogue One and Andor. For the Skywalker Saga, they should have finished with familiarity.",

It would mean that the chosen one prophecy is a repeating prophecy (which, whatever), but maybe it could also ease the idea of Rey taking the Skywalker name.\n\nAt the very least, continue The Last Jedi's idea that she is a nobody and that it's her choice to take the mantle of the Jedi/Skywalkers and fight evil. It's a little bit of a weird choice for the eighth part of a movie saga of the Skywalker family, but the Rise of Skywalker's attempt to make her relevant via Palpatine did her less favors than TLJ.\n\nIf Rey had been a Solo, it would make the sequels more connected as a more direct continuation of the Skywalker saga. There would be plenty of family drama and would turn the trilogy into a story of Rey fighting and trying to redeem her brother. \n\nThey probably didn't go this route for a few reasons. The moves would essentially be repeating the Darth Caedus and Jaina Solo stories from the old EU. Plus, keeping Harrison Ford after Episode VII might have been a tough ask.

There need be no lineage to justify it, much more importantly, it\u2019d make her being so strong in the Force come with its own hangups.\n\nFor example, growing up she could unconsciously pick up on what her peers were thinking, so they shunned her as a freak. This could even lead to her losing control and ending hurting or even killing one. \n\nHer potential for becoming the strongest Force user ever known should not equal to this perfection we see. It should cost her something, make others very uncomfortable or even afraid of her.\n\nIt should make some remember what happened to Anakin and even suggest killing her outright, rather than take the risk.\n\nNot that she should be evil, more that the actual implications of being so powerful would have made a very interest focus to the movies, one that was aware of what came prior without being too bogged down. \n\nIn other words, make the connection of Rey to the saga not through any lineage that explains her power but through the Force, and in the process drop the Mary Sue can-do-no-wrong angle.\n\nIt\u2019d also make a very interesting moral quandry. Can the galaxy risk another Dath Vader?

What makes Rey special for Snoke is that he is slowly decaying and not stabilized due to being a rejected body. He needs Rey to basically fix his body to reach his prime and exert his potential.

If she was a nobody, we could have just left the mystery alive and it would have been more compelling. \n\nOne of the biggest issues in modern Star Wars is they try to resolve every little thing. I mean avoiding Chekhov's gun is one thing, but part of what has always made Star Wars so compelling, is that there always are some unresolved beats and mysteries. It inspires the audience to imagine their own answers. It sticks with you.\n\nThen the whole Palpatine retcon made it even worse, not just because it undermined the whole point of her parents being a nobody, or even because it came out of nowhere and Palpatine never had any indication of having children in previous media and it felt unearned, though both of these things were significant. But moreso it tried to fix the key mistake of the previous movie by repeating the mistake again. It undermined the credibility of established canon. It basically makes you feel like, \"what's the point of getting invested in this story at all when everything can just change in the next movie\". It's the same problem you have with characters coming back from the dead too often. You don't feel the stakes anymore when you know that even if they die, they will likely just come back. It's the reason why multiverses are getting so uninteresting. Anything that happens doesn't matter because everything that could happen did and all the story needs to do is move to a universe where one key event happened differently and bam those key events never mattered.",

That's how the Jedi Order worked, the Jedi searched the galaxy for force sensitive children (nobodies at the time) and \"recruited\" them for their order, where they would then be able to make a name for themselves. That's how they found Anakin too after all. \n\n  \nThe problem I have with Rey's story is that she just doesn't seem to struggle a whole lot. Kylo Ren, her direct adversary and rival, who has been trained in the force since he was young, who knows what he is doing and he is good at it- yet he gets defeated in a direct force duell by a random girl from a random planet who didn't even know the Force existed two scenes ago (referring to the interrogation scene here). Said girl then immediately knows how to do a Jedi mind trick, despite her never even hearing about those before in her life, because the plot needed her out of her cell I guess. \n\nGenuinely if you look at her rivalry with Kylo it feels like Kylo is the underdog here. Which makes zero sense, Kylo should be absolutely dominant given his excessive training in the force, military leadership and lightsaber combat. Yet he just wasn't. Again, she beat him in a direct confrontation in the first movie, then she did it again in the same movies finale. I don't care that he got injured beforehand, he should have dominated that fight regardless. \n\nOr her sorry excuse of a training arc in the next movie, where she literally just trains herself. \n\nThey were so happy to copy so much from the original movies, why couldn't they have just copied the heroe's journey too?",

But at an early age, force choked one of her liberators to death by accident. \nHer memory of it as a child made her think someone else was doing it, but it was actually her having a strop. So, the surviving scientist (the dad would make sense) ditching her on that desert planet after his partner was choked to death in front of him. \n\nFew small events in her life being major red flags, but due to age and lack of training, she has no idea it was her or what she's even capable of. \n\nFound by Liea, because force stuff. While being picked up/rescued, a fleet of Imperial Remnants turns up with Kylo. Sod that first order balls. They are collecting force sensitives to become the new order of Inquisitors. They abduct her, mortally wound Liea, and take her to their evil master wonky face geezer.  \n\nKylo, under his masters instruction, tries to turn her. #shespowerfulwiththeforce\n\nScene is similar to what happens with Luke in Return of the Jedi.\nThe killing of the dude with the wonky face would have been her deflecting the lightsaber throw from Kylo straight into his chest. \n\nAs this happens, the ship is boarded. Lukes come for the girl. Show obligatory flashback of Luke arriving to hold his sister as she dies. Tells him he has to save the girl. \n\nLuke would be aware of her power, but oblivious to her being a Palpatine clone. The only person that knows what she is is Kylo, who is now hunting her in the background of the story. \n\nLike The One Ring, through Luke, she becomes even deadlier and scarier. Kills Luke after learning what he did to Kylo, convinced he would do the same to her.\nTurns out she's been receiving visions the whole time from Palpatine. Now Luke is dead he aint hiding anymore and starts to more aggressively manipulate. \n\nInstead of the huge fleet mguffin shit, I'd have had one of Palpatines giant cloning stations orbiting a sun. She turns up to kill him because she thinks she's the good guy. Fights multiple clones in various states of unfinished, then Kylo turns up. \n\nMeanwhile, after discovering Luke and Liea's deaths, Kylo actually has a redemption arc to stop her. Call it guilt or give some exposition of finding diary of Lukes guilt and sorrow blah blah. \nHe catches up to her at the Old Republic cloning station. Fights her, big Obi Wan vs Anakin style fight destroying station. He loses. After she kills him, brutally she realises what's she's becoming and goes to Tattooine to self-imposed exile. Yadda yadda *\"I am Rey Palpatine\"* end credits. \n\nNone of the weird rebellion stuff. Fuck Poe and all that trash. Get rid of all the chaff.",

The question then becomes where did she come from, like who were her parents.\n\nI don't know if it would have been better by much, as the sequel trilogy's shortcomings in regards to Rey is the indecisive backstory being told to us and herself. The building blocks for either of the two lineages was layed down in TFA and TLJ, so Ep9 could have explored or developed either one, but instead added a new possibility that came from out of nowhere and was heavily convoluted in the end. So it could have been better, but the bar was low, not sure if it would have been enough to redeem the trilogy and the character of Rey, but it would have been an improvement.",

If it had been the plan all along and was built toward via interesting storytelling then it might have worked as a great counterpoint reveal to the \u201cI am your father\u201d moment in ESB. Like think how interesting it might have been if in episode 8 Luke discovered via the force that Rey was a Palpatine and his path of redemption was responding to that the opposite way he did to kylo\u2019s corruption. He could have found his way back to the light side, helped her overcome the potential of her dark legacy just as he had, and set her on the path to rebuilding a new Jedi order with a more complete understanding and integration of the force. Even the Ren/Rey dyad could have worked and worked better as both an all around Skywalker redemption arc AND the ultimate defeat of Palpatine in that his descendent chose the light side of the force. Just seems like something more interesting and grander could have been done and ended up in the same basic place. Instead of it feeling like a rushed trilogy with directors playing story hot potato between films. And the more I think about it imagine if the TFA opened with Rey being a scavenger on the fallen Death Star remains. Was this in early concept art? I can\u2019t remember. Now there could have been a story telling opportunity connecting her more directly to Palpatine. Maybe some Sith cultist loyalists survived the crash and setup on the forest moon and messed around with cloning stuff and through that we eventually connect to Rey. She escapes the cult, survives by scavenging with the DS ruins, discovering artifacts, learning fragments of the galactic history, having strange visions and dreams\u2026  The mind wanders\u2026 But I am also 100% down with Rey nobody.",

I think they screwed up by deciding to hide her parentage without having the reveal planned out, and then the ST filmmakers realised no answer was going to be truly satisfying. \n\nI get the people who say she should have been a nobody, because it shows anyone can be a hero... but Star Wars is first and foremost a family saga. It's the story of the Skywalkers and the intergenerational conflicts and bonds of that family. It's not a superhero movie going \"look, anyone can rise up and become the hero who beats the bad guy!\" It's using the Skywalker family to explore how we're all shaped by where we come from and how we can redefine our own destiny. Each generation being born of and shaped by the last is an important part of the saga.\n\nRey as the daughter of Luke, who had been abandoned by her father and now needs to reconnect with him to complete her training and bring the Jedi back to the galaxy, would have been a far better story than Rey is maybe related to someone important, except oh no she's not, except oh yes she is, she's a Palpatine and- oh! The story's over before we really get to explore the significance of any of that.\n\nEDIT: Just to add, I think the \"anyone can be a hero\" angle was already covered - and done far better - via Finn. Developing his character further, maybe having him become a Jedi, alongside making Rey a biological Skywalker would have been a perfect way to have both \"the hero from nowhere\" plot and the continuation of the Skywalker family drama.",

As Rey has flown ships before she may have practiced the maneuver in question, though really she just needs to  have some understanding what the ship will do under the circumstances.\n\nWhat she does is shut off the engines after a quick reverse thrust, allowing the Falcon to flip forward in freefall, allowing Finn, whose  gun she knows is sticking straight out of the bottom of the ship to fire on the TIE, of which she rightly predicts will still be barreling straight at them.\n\nThis isn't a super skill.

Their familial identities are essentially stripped away so every Jedi is essentially a \"no body\". No on cared about who Mace Windu's parents were.\n\nMy idea would have been her and Ben were already Jedi, members of Luke's New Order. The Force Awakens begins with Rey and Ben on a mission for the New Republic, things go awry and we get a Jedi action scene (call back to Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan in TPM). Luke is at his temple overseeing things when he feels a disturbance in the Force. That disturbance originates on Korriban, where some artifact hunters disturb some Sith relics, triggering the spirit of a Sith Lord (as referenced in many of the games and books). Then we get a story of Rey and Ben going on a mission with Luke, Ben eventually falls to the dark side, becomes a conduit for the dead Sith, eventually leading to a story with the main characters dealing with yet another evil army and Rey becoming a great Jedi (but not without failing like Luke did in the middle movie).",

Finn ends up liking her for who she is, and deciding to help her whenever he can.\u00a0\n\n\nOh, and I\u2019d probably make Finn and her into a couple eventually, but having Finn not only be the main hero BUT also NOT force sensitive.
