Meant for exploration and research, while being quite spacious for both crew and cargo, very fast in hyperspace, very durable, and heavily armed with its mines and double turbolaser. (Although, it\u2019s probably more like a double laser cannon.) It works as a submarine, and can separate off its lower deck as an even smaller submarine. It\u2019s got a kitchen, entertainment room, and a medbay complete with stasis chambers and bacta tanks. And it has a sophisticated droid-style AI computer system that\u2019s hidden and shielded from detection in a secret room, which can let the ship operate itself if need be. \n\nIt\u2019s the perfect hero ship, in my opinion. Whether the main character is by themself or in a crew with up to 6~9 other people. And while it\u2019s meant to be used for deep sea and deep space exploration and research, it can be used for so much more. Like cargo-hauling, smuggling, bounty-hunting, troop transport, diplomatic escort, espionage, personal enjoyment, search-and-rescue, etc. Downside: it is *expensive* at nearly 1.5 million credits.\n\nIt exists only on two pages of a magazine article from 2003; Polyhedron 165. Invented by Christopher West, who also created the *Wayfarer*-class medium transport and *Vanguard*-class heavy assault gunship, in the same magazine. All three were made to be used as supplements to the Starships of the Galaxy rules in the d20 Star Wars Roleplaying Game tabletop system.",
