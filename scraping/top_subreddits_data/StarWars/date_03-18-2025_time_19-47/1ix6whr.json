From the getgo there were only ever going to be two seasons, we know how it ends (Rogue One), so the entire thing is about the journey, and that seems like it was fully mapped from the start. I'm definitely in agreement with an opinion I've seen floating around that the show wouldn't be half as good if the runners felt like they needed to keep some things open ended for more potential seasons, a la *every other Disney Star Wars show* we've gotten.",

I legitimately thought it was a different director, but no, it turns out that Michael Bay knows how to restrain himself and make a good solid film.\n\nIdk for sure but I'd imagine he had different people working on that film that had it turn out that way. Bay seems like George Lucas where he needs someone to control his impulses and push back on some ideas.",

The trailer is great. It seems that it'll cover quite a few missions Cassian has done for the Rebellion before Rogue One. A lot of characters from S1 seem to be returning, too, which is great (some of them, like Bix apparently, even seem to be taking a more active role in the burgeoning Rebellion) and that's on top of characters like Krennic and K-2SO. And i also love the appearance of what appears to be a TIE Avenger... haven't seen one of those in ages. Always glad to see new TIE variants. Canon already has quite a few nice ones, and it's cool to see some from Legends make a return, too. \n\nApril 22nd can't come fast enough.
