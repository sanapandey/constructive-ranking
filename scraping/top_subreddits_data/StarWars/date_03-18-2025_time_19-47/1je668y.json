Master Infil\u2019a\u2019s crystal fights back against Vader, Ben\u2019s crystal fights so hard it cracks from all the hate being poured into it, Dagan\u2019s is a little easier, only sending a shockwave through a relatively small room, but the thing to remember there is that the kyber crystal is a living thing, it bonded to Dagan, and it was being held prisoner just as long as he was. \n\nOsha\u2019s blade just kinda\u2026slowly turns red? Given that the crystal first belonged to Sol, who, while he had his flaws, had the best intentions among everyone, I would expect a LOT more resistance from it, especially from a girl who hasn\u2019t trained in the Force in years.",

I think we're bound to see at least 8 more shows/seasons addressing bullshit from the sequels, such as \"dyads\" in the Acolyte. They can't help themselves. I think by 2035 we might have a full season to gaslight us into thinking \"THOUSANDS OF STAR DESTROYERS BUT EACH STAR DESTROYER IS A DEATH STAR AND WE'RE TAKING THEM DOWN WITH HORSES BECAUSE WE BUILT THEM INCAPABLE OF EXITING THE ORBIT OF THE PLANET THEY'RE BURIED IN BY THEMSELVES\" (read in Nick Kroll's annoying voice, like when he's making fun of Jonah Hill in the roast of Franco) is great writing. God knows they already tainted The Bad Batch and Mando trying to explain the \"somehow\" in TRoS.",
