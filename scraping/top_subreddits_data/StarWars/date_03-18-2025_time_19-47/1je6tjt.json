Lastly, theres pretty much zero interactability with NPC's and stuff. So the cities look amazing but you cant actually do much. \n\nIts a solid 7/10 game, maybe even a 8/10 if you love the Star Wars universe as much as I do but at release it had some pretty noticable issues and frankly, even after patches, the gameplay loop can get boring.",

I could see it getting knocked at release for those things.  \n\nI liked the interactivity with the NPCs where some would reveal job threads, but there isn't much interactivity.  I think a game like RDR2 spoiled people where you have this button to essentially say HOWDY to anyone in the world and there's everything from generic responses to mission-opening responses.  Outlaws is def not RDR2, but also not many games ARE.  I love Cyberpunk 2077 but you can't really meaningfully interact with NPCs in that game either.  People on the street are always basically just standing around idly.  \n\nUltimately, I think it's a solid 7 or 8 out of 10, like you said.  How invested you get in running jobs and whatnot is up to you, there's not much else beyond the main story to grind out, but that's fine by me.",

I think Obi-Wan explaining the Force to Luke in ANH, and Luke explaining the Force to Rey in TLJ, are the two best instances of how we should think about it, and the creators writing for the Force should always try and go back to these explanations and see if their powers, etc tie back in with these explanations. \n\nTo bring it back to the kyber crystals, I like how they focus the lightsaber for use as a blade (technological) and give it the blade's color (technological), but that the color chosen is \"in tune\" with the person wielding the saber (magic) and that the crystal will hold it's color even if the saber is lost or missing and recovered by someone else (magic shitt) and that if a Sith or dark side user uses a saber for long enough, it will inevitably turn red (magic-ass-shit there) This feels like a good balance between tech and magic, I think that creators should always be looking for this kind of balance.",

Difference was minor enough that nobody else did it, but for him it was also symbolic part of the journey or something. If they made it into lore, then it could have been given bigger impact.\n\nAnother reason is that it prevented Jedi from accidentally coming across a Sith when they venture to same place to get the crystal of their own, it ensured they could remain hidden. Once they became more established they propably could have done it via numerous secret illegal subcontractors and smugglers, but early on the Sith who hid did not yet have connections and power they amassed over centuries.\n\nSymbolically it was also good. Something unnatural vs something natural, contrast between Sith and Jedi.\n\nIts actually propably what inspired the canon bleeding. And i do agree that canon bleeding is good addition, though at first i cringed a little, name did not help. But its fine now that i am used to it.",

Like some things I noticed were in episode 1, before you find out she has a twin, it shows Osha being unable to use the force to escape the prison cell. So with no dialogue, you then know that she\u2019s not guilty, where before you assumed she was because she looks the same as the person who killed the Jedi. In episode 3 there\u2019s a similar thing where you see the coven of witches lying on the floor in the burning building, but not burning, so you know something is up there. Then after the big lightsaber fight in the woods the tracker guy goes back to the ship, revealing in case you missed it that it\u2019s actually Mae on the ship and not Osha. None of that has any dialogue but it still communicates with the audience. (I just watched it so there may be more, but those are the instances that jumped out at me). That kind of stuff keeps you interested and isn\u2019t heavy handed. Plus it had cool lightsaber fights and I really liked the villain as a character. \n\nAll that more than made up for the awkward acting of a couple of the characters and some of the bad dialogue in my mind. I don\u2019t think it was a perfect show, but I quite liked it, and I don\u2019t understand why it has like 1 star reviews all over the place. Like come on guys, this isn\u2019t a one star show.",

Then when they closed LucasArts it felt like it was all crashing down.\n\nNow years later looking back I honestly think it's great. No things that have been introduced to Canon I have problems with. Yes, like most people I hoped that some plots in the sequel trilogy would have lead to other things and that the writing wouldn't be so all over the place.\n\nBut all other movies, Live Action shows, animated shows, have been great. Yes they also had their ups and downs but overall I like it very much.\n\nThe Mandalorian was refreshing when it first came out. Andor is a masterpeace. I'm a sucker for lore, fantasy and mysticism so Ashoka was amazing to me especially Baylan Skoll. Skeleton Crew was great fun just like Solo. I even think The Acolyte deserves a second chance as a second season. The last 3 or 4 episodes where great. Best fights perhaps in all of live action Star Wars.\n\nTo give a example of where I chose Canon above Legends is when it comes to cloning Force Users. I have always been against that idea. In Legends almost everyone got a clone at some point (over exaggerated) and it all seemed to simple. Palpatine had clones of himself. Thrawn had clones. There was a clone of luke and Jorus C'baoth that turned mad. Battlefront 3 even had 2 cloned Jedi brothers.\n\nThe Force Unleashed introduced the fact that cloning of Force Users might not even be possible or that simple at all and I'm happy the Canon adhered to this. When we finally reached that point in Canon with Palpatine wanting to clone himself to ensure his immortality it's still not possible. We get introduced to strand-casts as a sort of mid way point which I thought was really clever. Because if cloning Force Users was that simple then their shouldnt have been a reason for not having a clone army of Force Users in the first place.",

Palpatine returning in a clone body was never the grand sith plan, but cloning was always the contingency. And that's in-step with the prequels. The prequels are all about the fact that the sith cling to life well past its natural end. That they are unable to greet death in themselves or in others. And Palpatine specifically was very involved in cloning efforts. He also told Anakin his Tragedy of Darth Plagueis, where he gained the ability to create life (only to be killed, presumably by Palpatine). I think it would be crazy if Palpatine DIDN'T try to clone himself.\n\nAnd in the modern world, the most wealthy spend an obscene amount of money in trying to prolong their lives or stay young\u2014and the methods seem like things the sith would cook up, whether it's weekly blood transfers from your child, surrogate parenting, or cryogenic freezing with their bodily fluids sucked out like the canopic jars of the pharaohs. One of the major themes that unites the sequel trilogy is learning to accept death, as well as change, as a natural part of life. And Palpatine is the object lesson of what happens when you cannot let yourself change and cannot let yourself die. Luke himself skates perilously close to an inability to change, but by the end of Ep. 8, he relinquishes his hold on the past, and subsequently sacrifices himself to allow the resistance to live.\n\nSo, thematically, I think Episode 9 brings some of the seeds laid in the prequel trilogy to fruition.",

Like how a Mustang from 2010 looks similar to the 1975 version?  \nThey look different, sure, but you can see there is a lineage of design there.  \nNot saying it should look bland by any means, but it being \"copied\" feels like one of the things they were **supposed** to copy. Doug Chiang designed both the prequel armor and sequel armor and has done great design work for SW. I think he made it look updated but not TOO updated where it feels disconnected.\n\nMaybe the proto armor looked better since we knew the before and after, and the sequel armor doesn't have an after so it feels more out of place.

I didn't like TLJ at first, but after a re-watch I think it's fine.  It has some interesting ideas, which would have been cool if they'd been explored through a consistent trilogy, but doesn't really work imo as the second part of a three part story.  I just wish they had picked either one writer/director, or a consistent team, and had them do the whole trilogy.  \n\nI'll be honest and say I still haven't watched ROTSW.  The moment I knew Palpatine was coming back between films I lost interest.  It was the moment I realised that they had no idea what they were doing and didn't know how to follow on from TLJ properly.",

            "body": "Across the board, Disneys new canon has been more good than bad.\n\nThe sequels: messy, disorganized, needed clear direction, but overall had some really cool ideas that never got the love they deserved. Stellar performances across the board.\n\nThe mandalorian: fantastic pretty much the whole way through, season 3 fell off a little bit but it was still strong in my opinion.\n\nBook of boba: could\u2019ve done with being titled \u201cthe Mandalorian: the book of boba fett\u201d pacing was pretty off, and the tusken segments could\u2019ve been their own episodes.\n\nKenobi: more hate than it deserves, every actor did a fantastic job, the script was good, direction was solid. And it told a fantastic story that I never thought we\u2019d get.\n\nAndor: I don\u2019t even need to say anything for this, but I will. This show is a work of art, arguably the best piece of on-screen Star Wars media we\u2019ve ever gotten. Every second is absolute gold, and there isn\u2019t a single thing that they could\u2019ve done better if you ask me.\n\nThe bad batch: lovable characters, brilliant story. What some people said was filler was just the show giving us more time to breath and know the characters, see them grow and change. It\u2019s also visually the best that animated Star Wars has ever looked.\n\nTales of the Jedi/empire: Jedi was fantastic, but I don\u2019t love that they kinda retconned the ahsoka book. I prefer to look at it as an abridged retelling of that story, because the book is wonderful. Empire admittedly falls a bit flat for me, it was cool seeing more of dathomir, and I liked what they did with Bariss, but i couldn\u2019t get as invested in Morgan\u2019s story.\n\nSkeleton crew: fucking brilliant, a fun, light hearted adventure that stands alone while still adding to the worldbuilding, lovable characters, fun action and soundtracks, and the Jedi feel magical without even really making an appearance. It\u2019s also got one of my favorite one-off antagonists, I hope they get a season 2.\n\nRebels: people tend to forget this is Disney Star Wars. But I love rebels, it starts off rough, but it only ever really gets better. The main cast is amazing, and i am a ride or die fan of the best pilot in the galaxy, Hera Syndulla.\n\nThe high republic: my favorite era of Star Wars, and the 5 (soon to be 6) main Y/A novels are my favorite pieces of Star Wars media, the Nihil are my favorite enemy faction, and Ro is my favorite villain in Star Wars without contest. I could write a book on its own about how good this shit is. If you haven\u2019t read it, please do. I personally recommend the audiobooks narrated by Marc Thompson, that man has a voice that could melt god.\n\nThe acolyte: needed more time to grow. I personally loved it, but I think ||killing off most of the best characters|| kinda shot the show in the foot. I think they could\u2019ve put some of that off until a season 2, and it\u2019s a shame we\u2019ll never get to know more about what was gonna happen. Additionally, the show getting canned doesn\u2019t speak well for the future of on screen high republic/old republic content. So if y\u2019all wanted Keanu as Revan, you may have to wait a good while longer.",

Retcon!) is the best of them and that sickens me!), saw some of the 'Bad Batch' (prefer the first few seasons of Clone Wars to that...don't like the characters much, especially the female clone - bah!) and 'Andor' (a few episodes, which were so utterly boring that I would rather watch paint dry!)...but sadly there is nothing and I want the EU back and games like KOTOR - not 'Fallen Order' (tried that, but the fact that the character is so weak/bad ruins the whole immersion for me! Seriously, Ahsoka was YOUNGER than Cal Cestis is and she still was better trained and more effective in a fight, same for Baris Offee (sure she turned traitor, but before that she was an effective combatant in the order!))\n\nSome might say that the Mando show is good, but frankly the very fact that I know they destroyed the Darksaber and basically gave that green thing free reign to even do despicable things like eating some of those eggs from that dying species? Yeah, nope! Just nope! They also put too much emphasize on Stupid-Katan (Bo-Katan!)...seriously, that woman was a terrorist, who would have probably killed her sister if she thought it would restore Mandalor to the warrior culture it truly is deep down!\n\nThey also turned Obi-Wan (note: I never much cared for the character, especially since Lucas turned him into an asshole in Episode III - yes, I know he couldn't actually kill Anakin, but he should have been allowed to make the attempt by the script! Hell, have Palpatine show up right when Obi-Wan tries to finally kill Anakin! That way it's realistic that he runs, instead of finishing it - especially if the Emperor tells him that he has driven off Master Yoda, so Obi-Wan knows he doesn't stand a chance!) into a total idiot.\n\nNot that stuff like Hyperspace-Ramming - which makes all capital ships and they Deathstar and Starkiller Base a LIABILITY! Take this here asteroid, add a droid-brain (or an astromech!), a power-generator and a hyperdrive and you have a capital ship killer! Seriously, they didn't think this through...they didn't think the sequels through at all, they had two bad directors and a boss who wanted a feminist message sent and who basically doesn't care for the franchise (other than as a vehicle for her hatred for men!)...one of them always wants to \"subvert expectations\" (basically he wants to write bad movies and then tells you it's your fault if you wanted a good story!) and the other puts PEW-PEW over story (look at what he did to STAR TREK! A show that asked the big questions - he turned it into bad action flicks, with tons of pew-pew and no big questions at all...hell, he also broke Star Trek science with this Red-Matter-Junk!) - helped anything/did Disney Wars any favours! Hell, how can a troop of remnants (the First Order - which is frankly Imperial Remnant under another name, just like \"the Resistance\" is just the Rebellion basically (old wine in new skin!)) build Starkiller Base? How are lasers suddenly going past lightspeed? How can you see planets being obliterated in star systems hundreds or thousands of lightyears away in real time? What use is Starkiller Base once it has consumed it's star and thus can't fire it's weapon anymore? Seriously, the Deathstar was logical compared to this! Hell, why build this if Palpi has a fleet of Star Destroyers stashed, that ALL HAVE SUPERLASER?\n\nTHE SEQUELS MAKE NO SENSE! THEY ARE GARBAGE!",

Disney screwed up the story in so many other ways (don\u2019t get me wrong, I still like the sequel trilogy) that I could see them using some random new character or thing to drive that narrative; probably in the name of increased marketing and merchandising. Letting it be Luke and Yoda was classy, and I liked the way they did it as well.

Regardless of its destructive power, it seems weird that the Empire would continue the development of a Separatist battlestation still under construction following the Clone Wars. There would be significant opposition within the military to justify it, as opposed to building it from scratch themselves. (Source: Catalyst)\n\nI also like Thrawn\u2019s rise through the Navy. Having him receive 19 years of private training only to go from Captain to Grand Admiral in the 4 years during the original trilogy seemed a bit odd. Seeing him rise through the regular forces over 16 years was a much better development and build credence to the Empire accepting him as Warlord following Endor, giving his established history.
