I introduced my girlfriend to Star Wars and now she\u2019s been pushing to binge everything Star Wars. Just finished the Ahsoka series and it got me wondering what Luke\u2019s Jedi \"hero ship\u201d would be while he tries to rebuild the order. (It's not exactly comfortable or spacious being in a fighter all the time.) There's something fitting about Naboo building ships for a new Jedi order given their values and commitment to finding diplomatic and peaceful solutions. Not to mention that it was his mother's old ship. A retrofitted J-type that looks less ostentatious would be really fitting.",
