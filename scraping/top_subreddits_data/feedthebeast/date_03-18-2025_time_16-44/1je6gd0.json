One with snow and one without.   \n\n\n**Building Gadgets Schematic**: [https://www.reddit.com/r/9x9/comments/1je6222/snowy\\_chateau/](https://www.reddit.com/r/9x9/comments/1je6222/snowy_chateau/)\n\n**Create Schematic:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/CreateSchematics/comments/1je6b6x/snowy\\_chateau\\_vanilla\\_build/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreateSchematics/comments/1je6b6x/snowy_chateau_vanilla_build/)",

                    "body": "Thanks.\n\nCertainly. So, there are 3 levels within the build.\n\nBasement: There are one block airgaps within the platform sections. However, it's a basement, so you can just dig into the ground to expand for cables.\n\nFirst floor: There'a a one block airgap that runs under the flooring on this level.\n\nSecond floor/Attic: one block thick flooring. not cable friendly. This is more of a living space with room for your bedroom, enchanting and maybe some magic mod stuff. I would also add my armours and trophies up there because it's very spacious.\n\nIt's for sure a more aesthetic style of base. Functionality has been thought about and provided where possible, but there are some spots that are for the looks and overall it's a nice feature build for any snowy mountain range.\n\nPersonally, I would use it for start - mid game. It's purposely designed to be easy to gather for in terms of materials and wouldn't take much to get up and running. I would then plan to expand downwards if I wanted to enter late game, or expand to another building. Like a factory or something.\n\nLengthy response, but hopefully that gives you a better understanding of it.",
