    "selftext": "If someone really cares about it SPOILER WARNING\n\nSo this modpack is pretty light in all ways. Playtime, Grind and performance. It took me around 36 hours to fully beat it with all side quests completed(Except for fully occultism page which is added for no reason I guess).\n\nMods - I guess it's pretty standart mods like Mekanism, AE2, EnderIO and some others. But I don't know why the just added tons of useless mods like AA, Extreme Reactors, Immersive Engineering, Powah which got almost zero impact on gameplay adding like 1-2 necessary recipes, but there are Occultism and Ars Nouvea with absolutely zero impact on gameplay but having tons of quests, even more than every other chapters combined. (No Create mod in newest modpack? Am I dreaming?).\n\nQuests - There are 4 main chapters which is great but getting worse in late game and you got like \"craft some random shit to end the pack\" ahh gameplay and it varies from craft empowered items from AA to craft Quantum computer core from AE2 which I didn't even touched to this moment cuz I'm good with ID storage(I spent 8 out of 36 hours on crafting this core).\n\nDespite the everything i said above, I enjoyed playing this pack with that watery vibe(Such watery that you even need to plant seed only underwater) and custom progression with custom dungeons.\n\nAnd yeah, gambling, gambling for dirt, gambling for netherrack, gambling for creative things and obviously gambling against time for more gambling.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ln58o5kkgpe1.png?width=1688&format=png&auto=webp&s=49ec73726724535dba3b2d64629b07e7c0f45079",

            "body": "One thing I will say about the quests for things like ars, occultism etc, not all questlines are going to be required (in fact they are marked optional) so that people can explore those mods and use them to empower themselves if they chose to. The quests exists for people that want to get into casting magic, using occultism's storage system, accessing miners and things of that nature. Powah really only exists for cables and wireless transfer in this pack so there isnt a ton for it to do as we decided to let some of the other power mods shine (Powah quite often takes center stage for easy power production in packs it is in). \n\nThe quantum computer is pretty fast to craft as well but we should probably make some of the tricks to doing it fast more evident such as making singularities with liquids and replicating the circuits with replication and time wand acceleration. \n\n  \nNice feedback overall though, I hope you enjoyed your time!",

Sophisticated Backpacks for example, you could only get upgrades from loot barrels. \n\nI agree that the end game seemed to be just crafting a few things and you win... Someone in discord pointed out that the Mage robe was OP in the Rift and that made it SO much easier to finish out the pack. Without that I think I would have had a much harder time with the end of the pack. \n\nAgree with you completely on AE2. I didn't bother with ID, I was using functional storage drawers and a handful of Obsidian chests for storage right up to the end when I realized I was going to need to do AE2 to complete the pack. By then I had so many MEGA storage components that I didn't really need to put much effort into automating anything for storage disks.",

Like having Mekanism and not being able to use a gas burning generator (and have huge amounts of RF easily) was a trip, Oritech is cool, etc.  And the design is great...quests, aesthetic, tweaking, etc (ran smooth as silk).\n\nI tend to be more of a build my own modpack kind of player (80% my own packs, 20% pre-built).

It should require the player to make the particle accelerator. The components required to make the crystals that give you time in the rift really should require items from both magic and tech mods that are attainable at the end of their respective mods chapters, and should not be in the Airdrop loot table. \n\nI know it's semi-early in the release, so hopefully they take some of the feedback and improve on the balance of the pack.",
