    "selftext": "I want to be able to put stacks of items in top chest but only have it drop one stack at a time on the depot so items are always placed on depot and not floating. My problem now is it drops at the stacks of items at once so one will be placed on depot while the rest are floating. I\u2019m trying to have it one stack at a time because my little luggage buddies in the corner will pick up the floating items please help! Sorry for bad pics when I take screenshots they don\u2019t show up in folder",

Your items are dropping 2 blocks, so it always reads an empty space below it.\n\nIf you lower it by one block, the funnel will wait for the depot to be clear before dropping another stack.",
