Try and spot it in the first screenshot (second image for a reference). One flew around the corner and killed me instantly the other day and legit gave me the biggest jumpscare I've had in any game for a long ass time. If you don't know, they can only move when you move, are silent, and only spawn in the deepest caves. Also creepy af looking, 3 blocks tall and can outrun you if you try to sprint. I've never felt more anxious while mining in deepslate",
