    "selftext": "Last night I decided (on a Monday before reset day) to try and couple of mythic 0s on a couple of characters. On my DK, I ran a mythic Theatre of Pain that went....alright. I did fine damage wise but heroics have not taught me how to properly do important boss mechanics. But I did finish it. Meanwhile on my WW monk I tried a mythic Cinderbrew and that went terribly. \n\nThat bee boss kicked my ass, I was doing mechanics but I kept having to face tank bees to make them docile and they just kept spawning. After five tries I went to bed. I feel discouraged, I knew mythics would be difficult but I feel out of my depth. I'm gonna keep trying, I suppose I should just stick to 0s to learn mechanics and improve on stuff but good lord the gulf between heroics and mythics is wide. Is this just a learning thing? A skill issue i have to improve on? Does everyone suck doing mythics their first time? ",

                            "body": "The gap from heroics to mythical is wide, yeah. It's only going to get harder the higher the m+ goes due to affixes and general difficulty.\n\nWow is usually not hard as game in general, so to make up for that, this is content for the players that want the challenge of taking a more serious approach to the game. It's way less mistake forgiving and the higher it goes, the harder it gets, in a sort of exponential endless kind of thing.\n\nOn the plus side, the higher it goes, yes it's tougher, but you will also have a higher chance of getting team mates who actually know what they're doing and are better geared so the run actually goes a lot smoother.\n\nNo one is born knowing. It's a process. Yes, you're going to suck hard on the first few runs. Be prepared to deal with all sorts of assholeness from other players, some are outright idiots, some are cool. Don't get discouraged, this happens to everyone, it's just another part of it. \n\nHere's some advices:\n\n- go watch a yt video explaining the dungeon on m+ before. Don't try to watch them all, just watch the one you're about to do. \nThere's a lot of people explaining it quick and simple, what the mechanics are, what you should do and what to look out for.\n\n- if your key is higher, see what the affixes for the week are and what you need to do to deal with them. Sometimes you need to respec a talent or something to deal with a specific mechanic for that week.\n\n- Trash mobs are often harder than bosses, don't be afraid to use cool downs on trash.\n\n- Bosses actually only have like 3 or so mechanics to deal with and there's only 3 or 4 per dungeon. You'll quickly get the hang of it. \n\n- Get some add-ons to tell you what's happening, DBM, weak auras, etc, they help a ton.\n\n- don't force a dungeon that isn't happening. If your teammates are being totally oblivious, constantly dying to stupid shit, can't be reasoned with or are outright insulting, just leave. You'll save gold on repairs, time and valuable mental sanity in not having to deal with them. Better invest all of those is runs that actually have a chance to be successful. It's fine to give a few tries, people fuck up and make mistakes, that's fine. But at some point it's just not worth it and you're better of going elsewhere.\n\n- don't play if you're tired or aren't in the mood. Make no mistake, it can be fun but this is a mentally taxing activity. There's a lot going on to keep track of and will likely require your whole concentration to pull it off successful. You'll likely just get frustrated if you're not feeling it, might as well give it a go some other time.\n\n- consumables (flasks, food, etc.) are a nice to have, especially for higher keys. Not mandatory at lower level but if you're struggling, everything helps.\n\n- enchant your gear. Even if it's with a lower, cheaper version, every bit helps.\n\n- on that note, check wow head and icy veins for what your gear, enchants, talents, etc. for your class should be. If you've just arrived from heroics, you probably never needed to go the extra mile since content was easy up to now. Welcome to the big leagues!\n\n- don't be discouraged. It's mostly a repetitive activity with a lot going on. Humans get better by repeating something and this isn't any different. Try to be prepared, start slow, adjust your ui in a way that suits you and you'll be crusing higher keys in no time.",

Back to League, there's over 150 unique champions you have to account for, each has approximately 5 abilities you have to be aware of, and there's a number of items, runes, etc to be aware of as well. Plus the knowledge of when to CS (kill adds) versus fight (attack the enemy player), the fact you're playing against another unpredictable human, learning map awareness, etc. There's an entire industry around writing guides and making videos on how to be better. Much like WoW. You can't just load up a game or practice match and learn as you go, really, if you want to be better than average. And M+ is definitely \"better than average\".",

They used to play an overgear char they master in previous season, and now they take a 605 ilvl reroll they don't really know how to play... and then fail everything, don't DPS enough, don't use defensives, don't CC, make the dungeon hell for everyone, and leave first thinking \"wow this group is so bad\".",

If you are the only one killing adds, then you are doing right but the other dps are failing. Adds can then overwhel./ barrels don't get cleared and healer then can't keep up, causing a wipe. \n\nI suggest taking it slow. Pick a few dungeons to 'master' and ignore the rest for now. Watch some YouTube for understanding of basic mechanics and tips. Class/spec guides can even offer some further tips.\n\nIt's about repetition and learning, and muscle memory. People progress by making mistakes and trying over and over. \n\nAlso, know that the low keys have added difficulty of a higher number of newer and undergeared players, so you'll need an added layer of determination.",

            "body": ">Does everyone suck doing mythics their first time?\n\nPretty much, yeah. Don't get discouraged. When I did my first raid (Throne of Thunder in Mists of Pandaria) on normal mode, I was pooping my pants every new boss we got to; felt totally lost; couldn't do my rotation; dps was terrible; dying all the time. When we finally downed the last boss I was ecstatic. Then we started heroic and, again, I was so nervous on every new encounter. Years later I started in a mythic progression raiding guild and that culminated in CE in Antorus at the end of Legion. Even at that point, when I knew my class inside and out, had been raiding for years and years, I still felt like I was terrible (or was nervous about being terrible) on each new boss.\n\nThese days I'm a m+ only player but I still feel similarly each time I step into a new key level. Cleared all 10s and ready for 11s? I'm going to be nervous as hell and probably play worse than I usually would in my first 11s. Until I get that familiarity, it's going to be uncomfortable and I'm probably not going to play as well.\n\nJust get reps in by running the dungeons. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Also there are lots of great resources and guides on YouTube that others have mentioned. I think Quazii is great in particular.",

Practice makes perfect, and when you know your rotation and dont have to pay 80% attention to it, you have way more brain power for the dungeons.\n\nAfter you have done that, there is alot of content out there explaining tactics for the dungeons.

U cant really learn the game on the fly fast. U can adapt on the fly. Means, if u are allready a good player u can easily run, well even +5-8 keys first week and really fast +10 and higher without ever watching a guide or playing m0, perhaps just a +2 for the start. But if u are not good u need either a bunch of time and patience, someone how guides you through the game, thats how i learned it (in addition to playing another mmo for years before, so i had an easy start) or to watch videos about your class and mechanics that u can adapt quickly. That means, watch some guides for the dungeons (its perhaps 5-8 min per dungeon), a video to your class rota and possibly it can also help u to watch a youtuber or streamer playing your class in a dungeon, to see what they do. \nAlso, dont just copy specs. Read what all your abilities and talents do. \nFurthermore gear is a huge factor. U can bruteforce a lot of content just by overgearing it. Get your tierset, farm the delves, especially the 100% hero drop each week, etc., even if u dont get 1% better u will havr significantly better results just by your gear, which is motivational.\nLast tip is: dont twink. Focus on one class and how to master it. Thats how u progress fast. Once u mastered it, that means u should be able to play at least a +10 keys decent in the middle of the season (not on season start!) and especially when u get a feel for mechanics, meaning u can \"detect\" new mechanics and adapt to them on the fly by seeing similarities and differences between them (frontals, voids, soaks, group wide aoe, needed add focus, has all certain characteristics u can easily identify and play the mechanics without knowing the mechanics at the start) u can start twinking, u will get good really really fast on twinks then, if at least you also take care of the gear for them too.\n\n\nEdit: one additional tip. Dont try to much at the same time. The most important are the mechanics of bosses and adds and interupts. If your group lacks in that its a wipe. Second is your dps. I wouldnt focus that much on your additional cc since u have a good feeling for your dps rotation. Once u got that down, try to use your cc as often as possible. Try with picking perhaps 2, max. 3 abilities u try to use more often in situations where they can help the group. Increase it by 1 any time u feel comfortable till u can use all your abilities frequently while still maintaining your dps.",

Honestly, it doesn\u2019t have to be arduous, assuming you\u2019re not tanking or healing the 5 min quick boss guides will do you. At low keys you can probably tank and heal with these guides alone. \n\n3) build up slowly. Do a M0 world tour then start on 2s, 3-4 etc. \n\n4) have a thick skin. Some people are toxic. Don\u2019t let them get to you. \n\n5) Interrupt, please interrupt. \n\nThere\u2019s much more but that should set you well on your journey.\n\nAnd most importantly have fun",

But you need to know what to ask so stay at First by the basics and be confident in IT. \n\nM+ is an iceberg which can be very discouraging since people normally expect you to know mechanics when youre going into mythic+, in my experience everything is a little more chill when you say youre Not confident with this particular Boss or Dungeon so the group can prepare for it :)",

Dispels, interrupts, timing defensives, cooldown management, etc become more and more necessary as you climb key levels. \n\nI will also note its early season and M0s are populated with a lot of under geared/new toons trying to gear quickly. Under geared groups can make these types of runs really difficult. My best advice is to watch a few YouTube videos of dungeon guides - there\u2019s quite a few trash mobs with unique abilities that will absolutely destroy a group if not fought correctly. PSF and CM for example have a few mini bosses that are quite challenging. \n\nOn that note, don\u2019t let one run ruin your entire mythic experience. As someone who exclusively plays wow for M+, I have crappy runs quite a bit - you end up depleting more than you time when pushing higher.

We ALSO failed to complete a +2 after wiping on the last boss of Floodgate 4x. Healer only had a little over 3 million health and would get one shot by any death circle mechanic. And on my 630 monk tank I struggled to heal myself through the dot damage without a healer.  \nPlay if you're having fun. Don't feel pressured to do the content if you're not having fun. But, remember, just because you die occasionally, doesn't mean you have to not do mythics. I could show you screenshots where my friends and I did keys that took nearly 2 hours and our death count was 80+, 120+, or more.  It was because we were doing mythic keys that we did not have the gear or muscle memory to complete efficiently. But we enjoyed ourselves.\n  \n It does help to do it with people you know in Discord. PuGs can be toxic because people treat people in group like NPCs. Did a +11 Rookery last night with friends. Didn't time it. First pull, healer got 2 shot by 2 lightning bolts that landed within 0.1s of one another. I learned that can happen what is a trivial pull on a +6.  We finished the key fine. 14 minutes over.  \n\nOn the contrary, did a +10 Motherlode. 2 bosses down. 7 minutes still on timer. Mage leaves without saying anything. Dick move. Happens occasionally. \n\nTL;DR do what you enjoy \nhttps://imgur.com/a/6Zyh6PU",

Or give you mechanics hints mid pull for boss mechanics  (stack in 3\u2026 2\u2026 1\u2026.

Learn your rotations, the real rotation, not just spamming buttons. In lower keys where you're learning pulls and boss mechanics, send your CDs. Please do not sit on cool downs because a boss is 2-3 packs away. You'll eventually learn that pacing as you get better. Another thing to practice is defensives. Use them, often, even in low keys.

First off, I would argue that not even M0's always give a great idea of mechanics as sometimes the bosses die to fast and sometimes its hard to tell what damage you should be taking vs what avoidable damage you are taking. Not saying you are there yet but at higher keys, the things you should be avoiding will one shot you so in a way they are great teachers.\n\nAlso there are typically some new mechanics added in M0 compared to heroics so depending on what it is, there may not have been something you didn't learn right in heroics. \n\nAs far as the bee boss on Cinderbrew, this brings up another key point. Often, people are using M0s to learn either a new class or a new role or play and alt. You should not be tanking the bee adds on that fight, the tank should be gathering them all together but sometimes your tank is new too and has to learn that for himself. Maybe he's new to tanking or maybe just doesn't know the fight too well yet but that is not how it's supposed to feel there.\n\nKeep trying!

Right now though sub 650 is \"undergeared\" for DPS in m6+ because higher ilvl players are still trying to replace season 1 gear. Cinderbrew neck, ToP rings, Priory trinket, Floodgate trinket, etc. are all highly sought after items that players might still be using s1 gear for currently and need to replace. Unless you're a priority slot like Tank/Heals you won't be finding groups quickly.",
