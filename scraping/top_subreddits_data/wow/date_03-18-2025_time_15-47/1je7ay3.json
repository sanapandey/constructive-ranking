If you know how to not stand in stuff, interrupt big casts, and dance into Brann's potions you'll be fine at the higher levels. I cleared lvl 11 with no deaths the first week with ~630 or so ilvl.\u00a0\n\n\nGear is also much better from Delves this season with guaranteed heroic pieces via Delvers Bounty and gilded crests for completing 11s up to 3x/week.",
