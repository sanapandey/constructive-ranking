RwlRwlRwlRwl!*       \n\nThat's murloc for \"Welcome to Murloc Mondays\" - where people can ask any type of question about WoW without getting strangled by a Death Knight.       \n\nQuestions can range from what's new in Dragonflight, what class is OP, and how many Demons will it take to down Thrall?       \n\nQuestions can come from brand new players, players returning, or veteran players who never got a chance to ask the right question.     \n\nAfraid of not getting an answer? Rest assured, we know that at least 90% [of questions get answered!](https://redd.it/djsvm8)      \n\nYou may want to look at /r/wownoob as well!      \n\n***      \n\nHere are some handy guides to [start World of Warcraft as a brand new player](https://www.wowhead.com/new-players-world-of-warcraft) or [start Classic World of Warcraft as a brand new player](https://worldofwarcraft.com/news/23090134).      \n\nUnless you played in the current expansion, pretty much everything has changed. If you're returning after a very long break, check out the [WoW Returning Players Guide](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/returning-players-guide).",

Tank brann was overtuned allowing non-healer specs to run him and trivialize delves, got massively nerfed so he dies constantly unless directly sustained by a healer. \n\nHeal brann is still decent and the default choice for most things. Some self-sustaining tanks or tanky healers can run DPS brann.\n\n>Can I just run the same delve or am I encouraged to go to different ones? How many do I need to run in a week?\n\nNo, the gear rewards from bountiful delves are going to be what you're mostly aiming for, and bountiful delves change daily and are consumed when run. You can run up to 3-4 a day until you run out of keys.\n\nOnce you're out of keys and out of bountiful delves, you could farm normal delves but they won't give you much of anything beyond some undercoins or crystals.",
