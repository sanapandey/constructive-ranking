I believe it was 2578 attempts or something, I\u2019ve never brute forced something so hard lol\n\nPeople would stay with me to queue again and I leveled them up free of charge, I just wanted to queue again as fast as possible to get the mount as it\u2019s 1/2000 drop rate. It\u2019s really too bad they made all that gear obsolete in those dungeons. That was hella fun, and now it sits in the bank",

On your first timewalking dungeon run each time it runs, the final boss will drop a quest, that when handed in will get you 500 timewalking tokens, which can also help you save up for one of the many Timewalking vendor mounts that sell for 5000 tokens each. Also because as you're new there are so many dungeons to explore and experience and this is a great way to do that.",
