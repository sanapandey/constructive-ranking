They aren't doing any of this out of malice, it's just a necessary evil to them.\n\nThis is why I've been leery of the narrative the new writers are pushing where the Titans have actually been deceiving us this whole time and actually have sinister plans for Azeroth. That takes all the nuance out and just makes them regular mustache-twirling villains which is not even remotely as interesting. \u2639",

It's for their own good, since they'd probably be killed or hurt themselves if left alone in the wild.\n\n(hopefully the analogies are clear here)\n\nI think the Titans probably view themselves as benevolent, but I imagine the nuance will come down to whether their ethics and goals align with our own (e.g. the classic self-determination/free will question).",

Every time he succeeded in a plan was because of some azerothian enabling him, like that time we just basically delivered the primus keystone straight to him. I highly doubt he could've just had the Dreadlords kill Argus either, we needed the powers of the pantheon to defeat it and the only reason they had access to Argus to begin with was they convinced Sargeras to use the it as a resurrection engine so doubtful Sargeras would let them anywhere close afterwards.",

He didn't see it much different that using the elements.\n\nDenathrius justified it as propelling his own kingdom forward. Those who went along with it benefited and saw what was a fairly fruitful and happy life. The issue is he was doing it at the expense of all other realms.\n\nArthas literally viewed himself as the king of the undead, and the undead were his subjects. In spreading and building his kindgom he viewed it as bringing his subjects prosperity and strength. The same as any human king would. There's dialogue in the frozen throne I believe where he talks about this with KT.\n\nXal'atath, we admittedly don't know much about, but considering she's working for the void, she probably see's what she's doing as justified in spreading her kingdoms power.\n\nAll of these pople viewed themselves as justified.",

They're spreading order like they always have. \n\nEven before the cosmology chart, it was them spreading order. Like, apart from a brief time when they were \"the good guys\" in Legion, the titans are probably of the least retconned in terms of their goals in the game. The minutia and details of how they get there may have had some changes, but overall its' been the same.\n\nIt's still. The exact. Same.\n\n\nThis is why I hate wow lore discourse. People will seriously look at something like \"the titans are acting towards their own goals independent of us!\" and go \"god the lore sucks. Remember when they would act towards their own goals independent of us in the *good ol' days*. That was so much better!\" Like, its the same shit.

I think Metzen was on record saying that there was a meaningful discussion that, between the conversation and our display of power, we proved to him we were in effect the better option for protecting the Azeroth World Soul. I believe Algalon saw we could have continued to the point of defeating him. Remembering the Black Empire and the difficulty the defenses of the world had against the Qiraji, yet we were able to exact a surgical strike directly to the Old God to kill (or some are arguing to 'pacify') them, and we were actually doing it. C'thun had fallen, we were there for Yogg, and he saw the best chance for taking out N'zoth and Yogg was going to be the Heroes of Azeroth. The primary initiative of the Titans efforts originally was the preservation of the Azeroth Titan World Soul, after all.",

I know the lore in Shadowlands was all over the place, but the dude wanted to re-originate the entire universe, because he's a machine that foresaw something absolutely horrible that would throw the cosmos and it's realms into chaos, where the only \"sure way\" of stopping it was literally re-originating everything and starting fresh under one umbrella.\n\nI like that he also had a Constellar in the raid, because they are always present when re-origination about to happen, they are basically the harbingers of re-origination.\n\nI hated how they went about the Jailer's story, but I always liked that we were basically stopping him from re-originating the cosmos, and how that's a common thread when it comes to Titans/Titan-like beings.
