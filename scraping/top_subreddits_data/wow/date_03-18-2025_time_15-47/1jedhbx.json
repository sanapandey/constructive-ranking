Can happen during other forms of healer pressure depending on the pull making it especially bad.  It really should just be a dps defensive check but even with a defensive it can be brutal.  The paladin + lightspawn pulls upstairs really suck.  The double lightspawn before Aemya is another one that is just super rough.",
