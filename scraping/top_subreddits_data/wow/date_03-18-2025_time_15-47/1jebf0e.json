Like it\u2019s okay to have low dmg, but doing below par is just basically asking the others to carry you while you don\u2019t do anything. It wasn\u2019t fair to the rest of us to wipe on boss 1 over and over cuz you don\u2019t wanna hear the truth and start contributing.",

It's not fun for anyone to work harder on a boss because Bob the Outlaw Rogue is doing tank DPS because he's 625 in Heroic and has a grand total of 2 M0s finished so far this season. And no offense to Bob, he's a super cool dude, but he's gonna have to chill on the bench until he either gets geared, gets better at his spec, or we get the power boost to carry him easily.",

I agree that bullying people's DPS is toxic and should catch a ban, but I use DPS meters to help out my guildies. For example, we have a DK in my guild who consistently grey-parses. Like... 8s. On normal. \n\nUsing DPS meters, though, we were able to see his rotation and help him get bette, do more DPS, and even get a green parse. This helps not only him, but also the guild. \n\nI get it, though. Toxic people suck. But when dps meters are used well, they can be really helpful",
