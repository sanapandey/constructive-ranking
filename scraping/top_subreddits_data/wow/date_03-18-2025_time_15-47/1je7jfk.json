    "selftext": "I play Dracthyr Mage because I like the racials and LOVE the character customization of the human form. My personal Headcanon is that I am not a Dracthyr but born with dragon blood, that's why I have the racials. To be honest, I personally hate the Dracthyr form. Especially the running animation and the big feet, all the proportions are just wrong. So please let me choose my identity in the character select so I never get reminded what my race actually is lol\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vb4lotcyugpe1.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=118e30ac8c967e23baf97bf8df9dc1ddb58ef00a\n\nPs.: Also let us hide all the scales as Dracthyr, there are still some visible on your head even if you try to hide them all.",

According to lore, their visage forms are imperfect because they reflect their hybrid origins\u2014part dragon, part mortal. This imperfection is mentioned during the Dracthyr's visage quest, where Wrathion and Ebyssian (Ebonhorn) note that the Dracthyr's draconic features bleed through their mortal disguise.\n\n\nUnlike true dragons, who can seamlessly adopt a mortal visage, the Dracthyr's forms are a blend of their draconic and humanoid traits, symbolizing their dual heritage. This limitation is a reminder of their creation by Neltharion, who combined the essence of dragons with the adaptability of mortals to craft them as soldiers.\"\n\n\nEither enjoy your race or pick another.
