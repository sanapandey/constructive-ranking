    "selftext": "Does anyone else hate group loot? I genuinely wanna stop raiding because of group loot. I don\u2019t understand why they took away personal loot with bonus rolls. Why not have the option to make the raid group loot or personal loot. \n\nI understand for a coordinated guild, group loot is probably more beneficial. However for a pug atmosphere you can have a partial guild or group of friends just snipe the gear for each other with group loot. Obviously they have the win the roll but the odds are in their favor if it\u2019s 5 friends to 1. \n\nNot to mention in a pug people can also just change their loot specialization and roll on what they want. I tanked heroic fyrakk every single week and lost the tank trinket to dps and healers with tank specializations. I don\u2019t understand how there\u2019s no system in place to stop that.",

First of all, because everyone rolls need, it means the person who wins is more likely to trade it, and more often that not that goes to the most unlucky person. It smooths out that unevenness. But also because you're just rolling 1-5 on any boss and then 1-(2/3/4/5) for what piece of loot you get, the distribution is less streaky where you roll 1-20 four times for what drops, including items you can't use and then 1-100 in competition with everyone else. \n\nPeople think those numbers just collapse fairly into the same distribution; they don't. They collapse into pretty much the same overall odds, but this is the difference between flipping 1 coin and flipping 10 coins. You have the same chance (50%) of getting more heads than tails, but how that actually looks in detail is not even close. \n\nThe practical effect of that is that, even if there is no BLP, which I know is a sore spot for a lot of people who think GL is fine, when they reduced PL, I, and many other people, suddenly found ourselves regularly going much longer periods without any loot. To the point where raids are barely even a primary source of gear. That's what a lot of people are going to miss: back in Legion, people could and did primarily gear from raids, because you could actually rely on getting gear in raids.",

                                            "body": "A lot of people hate(d) personal loot because people couldn't opt-out of getting an item they didn't need. And once an item was already in your inventory, especially if you had even the slightest reason of keeping it (like transmog), the barrier to giving it away voluntarily is higher, and you'll also probaly get spammed with \"do you need??!?\"\n\nGroup loot at least allows a player to pass/greed on an item they don't need, on top of giving them the opportunity of needing on it if they want to. Personal loot had everyone eligible for an item automatically press 'need' behind the scenes and then it just spawned in their inventory if they won the roll.\n\nThe only actually solid argument against Group loot and in favor of Personal loot is the fact that Group loot doesn't take into account the group composition (which is kind of funny considering the name) when it decides what items a boss should drop. With Personal loot you could never get a Warglaive without a Demon Hunter in the group or a Bow/Crossbow/Gun without a Hunter in the group. But with Group Loot you can get multiples of such items that are unusable by anyone.\n\nThat of course is a way to get around 'abusing' the loot system by stacking specific classes for more items that can then be concentrated onto a select few people. Kind of like how you can do the same but in inverse with Group loot by only inviting classes that don't compete with you on Tier pieces or weapons or whatever.\n\nEvery other argument is just some form of \"I lost many item rolls with Group loot this is unfair I definitely would've gotten items with Personal loot!!\"\n\nI don't really personally care either way, honestly. I preferred Master Loot for guild groups and don't have an opinion for pugs because I think Group/Personal are more or less the same thing the vast majority of the time.",

If a boss droos a really good dagger for example, a guild like liquid would build a group with 20+ rogues and only fill heal and tank slots for only that biss, to maximize chances of it dropping and being traded.\n\n... They did it anyways and just invited people who could trade it (for a good sum of gold, too). But I assume that was their reason. Same reason why now the loot that drops is not restricted to the lootspecs in the raid. Blizzard doesn't like to much determinism in their loot, opposite to players who usually LOVE it (though if everything was deterministic, it could also possibly get boring - see loot in guild wars 2 for example).",

Or you could get tier pieces on classes that already had that tier slot, and there was no other player of that class to trade.\n\nSaying that you could get a bow with no hunter or glaive with no DH is a bad argument, because you should have one of each class for raid buffs. Group Loot is another tool for Blizzard to improve class diversity, and class diversity is always good for the game. No matter if you're a guild or a raid lead pugging, you should aim to have at least one of each class because it will make the raid easier.\n\nTier Token distribution is more fair this way, because tier tokens didn't exist with Personal Loot. If a mage got a tier shoulder they already had, they could trade it only to other mages, they couldn't give it to a druid or hunter, because the Mystic token only dropped from Group Loot, Personal Loot gave you the tier directly.\n\nIn my opinion, fixing Group Loot issues would be better: \n* Instead of weapons, bring back weapon tokens like in Castle Nathria, that way you fix the bow dropped but no hunter problem. \n* Make it so you can only win one piece of loot with need per boss. If you win two, pick one.\n* Bring back bonus rolls.",

            "body": "Because Blizzard can't compromise and \"fix\" things in moderate way. When they try to fix something, they very often go 120% in other direction and it takes them couple of patches to even things out. \n\nPrime example: dailies. \n\nCata - moderate amount of dailies for starter reputations, a little bit too many for Molten Front, but if you didn't start late, not really an issue. Also zone and raid top tier, so some leeway is allowed. \n\nMoP - Blizzard probably noticed that people liked Molten Front and related dailies, so they decided to give players more. Much, much more. Starter reputations had so many dailies, that you couldn't take them all at the same time due to journal cap of 25 quests. And each major patch added even more dailies. So obviously people complained.\n\nWoD - so what Blizzard does? Removes dailies completely. Players have mission table and that zone of choosing to get Apexis crystals and that's all. It was only with Tanaan Jungle when dailies came back. People obviously complained. \n\nLegion - so what Blizzard does? World Quests. A lot of them all over the place with different reset timers. I like this system in general, but it was just too many back then. Overshadowed by how good Legion was, so it went under the radar (as well as AP farm that caused people to burn out). So amount didn't really change until now. I think TWW has more reasonable numbers and reset timers. \n\nAnd it's the same with loot rules. People were complaining about loot system in LFR, so they introduced personal loot and for some reason enforced it even in premade group content. People doing premade group content were obviously complaining, so Blizzard removed personal loot completely instead of looking at pros and cons.\n\nSo after this wall of text I think it should look like this:\n\nLFR - personal loot;\n\nPUG, no guild group - defaults to personal loot, but there is option to change it to other variants - group loot (though as far as I can tell current group loot functions basically the same as \"need before greed\" that was removed with BfA prepatch and enforcement of personal loot) and possibly new option - transmog only (if you don't have appearance unlocked you can click transmo option. If it's your primary weapon or armor type, you get priority roll. If it's not, then second priority roll just like with need for offspec. And finally if you have appearance unlocked, you can click greed and get the lowest priorty roll);\n\nGuild group - defaults to group loot with current settings, but there is option to change it to master loot (available only for guild groups), personal loot or transmog only;",

It was listed as a tank trinket, but it was BiS for healers in high M+ and used by a decent number of squishy DPS classes (like hunters) in push keys, since it gave you an extra absorb shield that could take a huge hit.",
