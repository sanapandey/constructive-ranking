Therefore, the challenge might not be as intense as for other classes.\n\n**Start phase**: I attack the boss and position myself directly on the right side where the stadium curves. This causes the adds to spawn relatively close together. The boss will then perform his fire rain and leap. Just dodge these. After that, the adds and the bombs come. You should throw the bombs at the adds as quickly as possible so they die quickly.\n\nThe start phase essentially repeats itself over and over again. However, **you should pay attention to this**: The boss goes into his intermission at about 80% health, during which you need to beat down his shield so he doesn't heal for 25%. Therefore, you should time the boss's health so that he isn't just spawning adds when he goes into intermission, as this part could become very difficult. After that, the boss periodically goes into intermission, especially if you take too much time, like at 70%, 60%, etc.\n\n**Further course of the fight**: In the later stages, I moved counterclockwise in the stadium, making 2 laps around the stadium by the time the boss died. Eventually, oil puddles will appear on the ground, which are annoying but not too bad.\n\nIf you are a class with finishing moves, then from about 20-25% health, you can stop focusing on the adds and instead kill the boss. That's how it worked for me.\n\nHere are my stats: Warlock - Destruction - 647 Item Level \n\n**My setup:** CsQAYIOwXTfhprvln24ZeRPDbwwYmZmZmYMgZbmZGmlZzgZmZxsZWWMzAAAAAzMDLzMLzYBGYWMaMDIzWshBAAAAAAwYmZGAA\n\nI have aligned my talents for single-target and the health of my companion. I dealt with the boss using the Blueberry and had Brann as a healer.\n\n**What's most important:**  \n\n* Always position yourself at the edge of the arena and never run into the center. As soon as you or the boss is in the center, you run the risk of adds spawning on both sides, which makes it nearly impossible to kill all the adds.\n* Kill all adds. If you don't kill all the adds, new ones will spawn faster. Only ignore the adds if you have the chance to nuke the boss.\n* Save your CDs for the intermission. I would say I deal decent damage, but even for me, it was sometimes very tricky to defeat the boss in the intermission without CDs and just dodging.\n\nMaybe I helped someone with that little \"guide\". This Boss is crazy hard imho. Harder than Zek'Vir. Good luck to you guys. You got this! ",

Didn't I hug the border enough maybe ? Because of that I assumed to spawn was random but maybe not given your experience. \n\nAlso did you often deal with the bug when they spawn out of reach ? This is the main reason I gave up, it's insanely frustrating to see a decent try go down the drain :(",

                    "body": "Don't give up. I had this problem too, and here's how I solved it:\n\nWhen you enter the arena, you are in the entrance area. As far as I know, this area is not recognized as part of the arena by the mechanics, which is why the bots also spawn to the left of the entrance. So, when you start the fight, you should immediately run to the right. Almost to the end of the first curve. Then the bots should position themselves correctly.\n\nThe bots appearing on the other side is because you stood too centrally, or the boss was too central. Try to make sure the boss is almost cuddling with the wall, and you should also stand very close to the wall. The closer your distance to the wall, the safer it is that the bots will all appear on your side.\n\nWhat I also found out: Some remnants of the fight, like oil stains (I think) or already destroyed robots that are then burning, act as a barrier to new spawns. This means: If you have defeated a group of bots, you should continue to move, much further. Only then do you enable the bots to line up. If you stand too close to old broken bots, there is a high chance that a bot will spawn somewhere else.",

Also bind the interaction, I didn't even know this was possible to replace the clic for that\n\n  \n*Edit :* Btw, by \"out of reach\" I meant outside of the arena, but the advice to avoid spawn on the opposite side is also very valuable",

Hopefully this helps someone!  \n\nDefinitely bind your interact key for an easier time dealing with bombs. Stagger taking Brann's healing pots - the instant heal isn't what matters, it's the HoT, which is refreshed to full duration when taking a new pot.\nYour position (and the boss') is the key: cronies will spawn based on boss position - provided there is enough space nearby (read: boss isn't on top of dead cronies: this will mess up spawns almost every single time without fail.) Your position, relative to boss, matters for footbomb spawns - in my experience.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SU-d6RlYvoA",

There's also no real stressful mechanics like the egg spawning an add that can stun you, kicks, and dispels. You legit just hit the boss while moving around after each set of adds you kill with bombs, I think the only thing that could one shot were the orange swirlies on the ground at  640 ilvl, other than that there are no actual one shots unlike Zekvir who had multiple ways to instagib you or just brick your attempt by fearing Brann out of the room and resetting or spawning eggs in the cubbies while spamming frontals at them.",
