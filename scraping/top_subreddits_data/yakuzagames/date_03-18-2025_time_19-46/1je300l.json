It became a holding pattern of sitting and waiting for news if the next Yakuza title would come out internationally since it was so niche the conversation would end with how it doesn't have a strong appeal outside Japan. A loyal but small appeal. The plus side is I get to take my time enjoying them. Because I personally think these games were not designed to be binged played in succession. So savour them.",

As players, we feel threatened that the longer they sit on the IP, the less time we can get to play as that character.",
