If you want a flair that says something else, you can edit it to say something like [Discussion: Y1 spoiler] or [Majimapost: Y6 spoiler], etc. **THIS INCLUDES CONTENT FROM TRAILERS**.\n\nIf the post is not marked for spoilers, all comments that have spoilers need to be tagged \\>!like this!< along with indicating which game it's spoiling. Example: Y3 >!Kiryu sings!< \n\nIf the post flair is marked for spoilers, the comments don't need to be tagged for the game indicated and the ones before it (So a Y6 spoiler post can have comments with untagged spoilers for Y5, but not gaiden or 7). \n\nIf you see any of the above (or any of the other rules) not being followed, please report it so we can keep this place safe for newcomers and those that haven't finished all the games yet.

            "body": "Here is my full review. Long story short, i\u2019m disappointed. I will mostly be covering my criticisms of it since this sub can sometimes become an echo chamber of downvoting anyone that has legitimate, and harsh but fair criticisms of the game.\n\n\n- Sailing *sucks*. The whole thing is a blatant attempt to pad playtime as you fight the same enemies, do the same tactics to destroy them, sail at a snails pace until you get into another encounter, repeat. Exploration is redundant as well. \n\n\n- (This is subjective, so feel free to check for yourself) The OST is same-y and forgettable\n\n\n- The story >! is a major problem. It is more of a disney plot than anything. And this whole plot will likely be inconsequential to whatever happens next and the new cast will be thrown away. Also, Majima is never shown his solemn/serious side. His personality in this game is just \u2018the silly goober\u2019. And as a result of this light tone, no one ever feels in danger. When Jason was stabbed for example. In a Nagoshi Yakuza, if a non-main character is stabbed, they are almost certainly dead. But when Jason was stabbed, the tension wasn\u2019t there for me as the tone of the game gave me the expectation that he would survive (which he did, shocker)!<\n\n\n- Nele Island, Rich Island, and Madlantis have almost no content to them. Madlantis pales in comparison to the Castle in Gaiden. Madlantis is smaller, has a worse Coliseum, and has unavoidable encounters since the place is so fucking narrow\n\n\n- The contrast is way too high. Everything looks unnaturally bright\n\n\n- They completely ruined Heat. You cannot upgrade your heat bar, the selection of heat moves you can do are slim, and they deplete the entire bar. \n\n\n- At the beginning, I didn\u2019t care for Noah. But by the end\u2026I still didn\u2019t care, but just a little bit less\n\n\n- Combat is very good, but still not as good as LJ\n\n\n- The antagonists >!are one-note because they do not have time to be fleshed out, because all of the other potential antagonists (Shigaki, Rodriguez, etc) Majima ends up befriending anyway. Law has to shoehorn his motivations right at the end because they gave him like 5 mins of screen time in the whole game prior.!<\n\n\n- Raymond Law is modeled (and voiced) by Samoa Joe. Samoa Joe is a wrestler. >!So tell me why the fuck is he wielding a Naginata instead of, you know, giving him a wrestler moveset? They gave a wrestler moveset to one of the side characters, but not him?!<\n\n\n- Bosses are way too easy. Not necessarily from how much damage they do and receiver, but the types of moves they do, how fast they are, etc\n\n\n- Excluding completionist stuff. This game takes about ~15-20 hours to complete. Yet it is a full-priced game, IIRC the same price, if not marginally less expensive than IW. That is a disgrace.\n\n\nLong story short, I enjoyed the game mostly, but in comparison to the other games in the franchise, it is *weak*. I really hope this isn\u2019t the start of a downward spiral of mediocrity for this franchise",

For Gaiden I didn't care much for the story until the ending, same as Pirate Yakuza with its post-credit scene. Although, I liked Pirate Yakuza's story less.\n\nAs you already said >!Jason got stabbed for a shit reason. \"Eh I just wanted to threaten the kid\" yeah yeah. Tell that to the police. Also I knew it that he would survive despite the shabby attempt to have us think otherwise at the end from Tucker.!<Also >!Masaru's mini-betrayal felt forced and it was just for putting more content or maybe to explain Mortimer's betrayal 7 years ago with a twist.!<\n\nAnd other thing >!the suspension of disbelief with Noa's. I read somewhere here about they despise Jason at the beginning for doing like a normal parent would do, to not let a stranger kidnap your son. So right lol. Also with Noah I understand that wants to explore everything but please, don't be tagging along with Majima in dangerous places, you would get kidnapped or slow him down.!<\n\nThe combat felt nice but it's not the best. I dunno, I loved revisiting Hawaii but thought that \"Damn, I miss Infinite Wealth combat\".  Despite that, I had a good time with substories and minigames, although I cannot be arsed to play cannon baseball long enough to get the points for either the chest or the golden-tier character. Naval combat is fun at first but it loses the charm after a while. I hope that the character customization keeps being big in future entries but I feel like they only would put it in action games and not the turn-based ones. Minato girls sidequest was funny to me so RGG, please keep it coming with these silly substories.\n\nThe balancing is off with 1 single heat bar, raising max reputation too fast (making the vocational school not needed anymore with maxed pirate level) and maybe with few upgrades you are a killing machine. Granted, I played on normal but it felt that I was draining enemies heat bars with simple combos. Maybe coincidence or having the stats + gear too high but it happened 2 times >!The first combat against Saejima, after one fight scene, a heat move and 2 or 3 heats and he was defeated. With Raymond's combat, he had a lot of heat bars, but I used a dark instrument after they land in the ground (Raymond was using the sword) and finished the combat. Not sure if the monkey is op or maybe he only had 3 o 4 bars left.!<",

I know that's not a new concept for the series, but it is a little frustrating doing the same stuff for the majority of side stories and minigames for several games in a row. Anyways, all that means is that the game really has to stand on it's own legs where new stuff is concerned. That's the story and the ship based stuff. \n\nI'm like 2/3rds of the way through and so far the story has been a complete nothingburger. Majima has almost no personality in his amnesiac incarnation. We're regularly carrying along multiple children to our life or death ship battles where we mostly don't actually kill anyone. Even when the stakes are supposedly high. It stretches disbelief pretty hard. None of the new characters has really made much of impact, Noah included, which is disappointing as he's basically the game's secondary leading character. \n\nAs for the ship combat, it outstays it's welcome after maybe a dozen fights at best for me. Doing the devil flag and coliseum stuff was a massive slog. Some specific enemy types (grenadiers, sumo wrestlers) are incredibly annoying to fight as they just sorta push you around constantly without actually dealing much damage. I guess I can look past some of my complaints as it's a side game, but I really expected a little more out of the title.",

This story was one of the worst in the franchise, the pirate stuff feels like an afterthought and isn't all that fun for me due to the lack of depth. \n\nWith Gaiden, despite its blemishes I enjoyed the story a bit, but seeing the way the story was handled in Infinite Wealth and this one I'm just not all that interested anymore. I especially hate the story this time around and I don't want to see any kind of story in this tone again, even if it's a spinoff. It was clearly made to cater to the people who see the funny Yakuza clips on TikTok haha funny, instead of having the amazing serious J-Drama and silly stuff that the series often had before. The depth of the characters is gone, everyone and the plot in general just feels like a parody.\n\nWhatever. I feel I'm just watching my favourite series decline at this point.",

My one semi-complaint is that Majima feels pretty OP even with just a couple upgrades, but I spent a huge chunk of that time on sight-seeing and minigames so I'm still fighting some pretty early enemies. I say semi-complaint because the combat is still super fun, I just think it would be more fun if I needed to think a little more about what I'm doing instead of plowing through things almost like a musou character while nothing can touch me. Hopefully at least the Amon content is a decent challenge if nothing else. \n\nThe ship combat could be better too I guess, but that's the part of the game I was least interested in anyway so the fact that I enjoy it at all is honestly all I was really hoping for. I'm still on the base ship too so there's a lot of room for it to get better.\n\nAlso I'm playing in Japanese but I swapped to the English dub for a bit so I could hear Matt Mercer's karaoke, and it's such a big improvement over Gaiden and IW's English karaoke dubs imo. Not only did he do a great job, but they also didn't butcher the hell out of his performance with auto-tune.",

It's crazy that after all this time no developer has been able to recreate the fun of Black Flag despite this game taking the fundamentals of Black Flag's ship combat for this game. The ship combat is either really easy or crazy overtuned depending on which fight you are doing, but either way, it ended up just being boring.\n\nGoing around doing all of the side content on Hawaii was still fun despite most of it just being the same content from Infinite Wealth and the combat was really fun despite the game being way too easy even on professional. Big shoutouts to the final scene of the game which was the only good part of the story and them putting live action in the game and not just making it awkward pervy gravure. Though I'm sure the mileage will vary depending on if people find Ryuji Akiyama funny or not.\n\nOverall I don't think this is a bad entry, but I didn't like it by the time I was finished (I did everything but couldn't bring myself to finish the coliseum. so no Amon for me this time).

It\u2019s not ruining the game but full blown pirate battles in US territorial waters?  Like I can look away from a lot but that\u2019s just a bit much. Madlantis was fine it\u2019s just a theme park at the end of the day (one of dubious nature) but the other pirate stuff while fun \u201cish\u201d was a bit much for me to suspend my belief. \n\nMusic also kinda blows and all the dynamic intros and boss fights suck, like they dropped the dynamic intros ball HARD and those are some of my favorite things about Yakuza titles. Why do I fight Keith six times? He\u2019s hardly a step above a generic mook why do I keep running into him? \n\n7/10, not the worst RGG game but not in the top spots for me.",

The combat is just clunky and awkward as all hell and even with Max Upgrades, Max Equipment, and my crew having S/A ranks, I feel like I deal fuck all damage. Meanwhile the opponent just completely obliterates my asshole like nothing.\n\nThen the Pirate Colosseum takes it to a whole other level. The S rank time for Quick Clash would honestly be fine if it weren't for the fact that it takes 80% to 90% of that time just to get the main ship to 0 HP once you get to Gold, if you're even lucky enough to survive. Then when you get on board you're forced to already have the Dark God instrument charged to even make the time.

Ran through the highest difficulties with relative ease. Could just be a matter of tweaking your lineup until you find the right mix.\n\nAlso, if you haven't maxed out your pistols, do it.

Saejima got shafted, Noah is ever annoying, plot is all over the place. It had some great moments but we have seen all this before.\n\nShip deck battles with the crew were a novel idea and pretty fun, Dynasty Warrior style, only the game's combat don't quite lend itself to fighting against crowds with being CCed for so long all the time. Got really frustrating by the end.\n\nMost activities are just reruns from previous games. As far as sandbox Yakuza experience goes this was pretty decent, maybe 8/10 but as a Yakuza game full package with technical performance, story and how systems interact together I fear I have to say 6/10. Overall probably the worst Yakuza game I have ever played - should they fix technical state of the game it will be just mid or even pretty fun. Right now can't give it more than 6.\n\nWe need a palete cleanser game next, I have big hopes for Project Century. Right now RGG have a little shaky performance for me, if the next one is not a banger from the start I might stop buying them on release. I always wanted to make a point to support the games so we get more of them, but that is not a signal they can lower their standards and start releasing slop because hardcore fans will buy them anyway. The next one better have story on par with the first Judgment and 7.",

So to safe to say, I'm pretty good at playing yakuza, including the like a dragon series and Judgement. Yep. I love me some Tak. \n\nI will say this however, this is the first time a yakuza game actually disappointed me. Not as in this game is bad, but this game is way too easy. The said side content is good but it's so much of it I feel like I should be playing the said side content most of the damn time. This was Majima's magnum opus. And to say it truthfully. It was lackluster. \n\nAs much as the combat in the air was great, I feel like a lot of the said specials and movesets followed by the ongoing easy mode of AI, it just wasn't crunching my numbers correctly. Things were moving too damn fast and it felt like a slug fest at the same time. I can't believe it. The padding for side games officially wore out it's welcome but I understood why it was like that. If anything I welcomed it. \n\nBut this time? God damn dude, I got so damn annoyed with the amnesia bit. Don't care about Noah. Sorry. The sick kid from an island who saved me did not made me feel anything about his family problems. Anytime he showed up, I felt like he was a nuisance. At least with Haruka and Haruto, it made sense. But there was no reason why NOAH WAS FUCKING THERE ALL THE TIME. \n\nAND GORO. ITS A FUCKING TIGER CUB. HE CLEARLY IS ONE. GOD DAMN DUDE. >!NOTHING ABOUT NOAH AND JASON'S FAMILY MADE ME EVER FEEL ANYTHING UNTIL JASON GOT HURT AND EVEN THEN. I DID NOT CARE.!<\n\nI did not feel a thing until the end of this game and >!Majima gets back his memories, it was so lackluster. It wasn't during the torture scene. It was bits and pieces. I so wished that the player could've got more of Majima's memories by simply going around and reminding Majima about stuff that happened in his life.!<\n\nBut honestly, see the characters that I liked so much and many more individuals that I missed? It was kinda worth it going through the mud. And that special someone? Well, kinda glad we didn't get to hear them. That voice actor should spend some time away for a good minute for a break. \n\nHonestly? Combat was pretty great. It was something to chew while we wait for LAD9. \n\n8.5/10",

The story was in one ear, out the other for me. Parts of the main game just tell you to go do side stuff which happens in other games, but it's really noticeable when the game is this short. (Haven't played Gaiden since release, but I seem to remember the pacing for these moments being better.)\n\nI was originally pushing for more Gaiden style games, but after this I would much rather they have all hands on deck for the big releases. I'm getting worried that after 2 decades of consistent quality releases, RGG is starting to spread themselves too thin. (Even with their growing staff)\n\nThey're busy reviving Virtua Fighter and shaking things up with project century.

The only game I've played recently that had a localization that met the \"anime standard\" I outlined above was _One Piece Odyssey._  It's not even a pie in the sky standard, either\u2014as I said, the vast majority of Japanese media localized to English (anime) manages to hit that mark.

And this is why I provided the counterexample up front.  Anime localizations are 99.9% unassailable in this regard, and that includes dubs.  You have to cherrypick to find legitimately \"game localization caliber of bad\" examples.\n\nIf I rolled dice to pick an anime episode at random (from the last decade or so), and rolled again to pick a random minute from that episode, it is a near certainty that every line of dialogue in that randomly-selected minute would be an impeccable localization.  If I did the same thing for a Yakuza game, it is a near certainty that I would walk away with golden examples of the localizers making needless changes to the meaning of the words coming out of characters' mouths.\n\n> maybe if you provided examples this would be a little more agreeable?\n\nI linked one to another fellow in this sub-thread.  [They localized \u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046 as _\"You make me proud to be a mother.\"_](https://youtu.be/tLKyA33pOUM?t=710)\n\nIf your immediate reflex upon learning this is to leap to their defense then we are done talking.  It is not the localizers' job to provide for the English audience the inner feelings of the speaker if they aren't explicitly voicing them, or whatever they were trying to do there\u2014as if they believe understanding unspoken feelings, in a scene acted out with voiced dialogue, is a skill unique to Japanese speakers.  They took it upon themselves to rewrite that scene and that is simply not their job.  _Anime would never do this, full stop._  This also completely ignores the drop dead absurdity, which _anyone_ would pick up on, of trying to pass off a single word as carrying the meaning of an entire, nuanced sentence.\n\nOne example not good enough?\n\nHere's one I had to pause the game and research, because, as with the vast majority of dialogue in a given Yakuza game, it was not voiced, and so I was at the complete mercy of whatever shitty text the localizers decided to give me.  This is from _Judgment._\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/dLNOPDG.jpg\n\nAs I note in the blurb, this particular example ran afoul of the classic localizing snafu: Changing the dialogue also changed the character's persona.  Which is the gourmet numero uno no-no.\n\nWe _have a better standard_ that is delivered in quantities 50x+ more than the output of game localizers.  It's not some magical, unattainable ideal.  It is straightforward, literally day-to-day reality.",

We also had dead souls from Nagoshi which is even weirder than pirate yakuza. \n\nYakuza 7, both judgments and Gaiden (original) were good serious stories which proves that Yokoyama can do them but Ichiban and Majima are more outlandish protagonists compared to Kiryu so we see the world through their lens which is why there is a tone difference in recent RGG games which don't have Kiryu as the sole protagonist anymore",

Respectfully though, I don't think the weaker parts of Nagoshi's plots even comes close to the nonsensical lows of everything post Like A Dragon so perhaps we'll just have to agree to disagree on the quality drop. And to that point, Ichiban and Majima being outlandish characters is precisely why they're so hard to write without going off the rails as caricatures which is what they've become since his departure IMO.\n\nYakuza's tone is uniquely delicate as a serious crime story with charming goofiness sprinkled throughout - it's a balance that's extremely tough to pull off but incredible when executed correctly (and why it's so beloved to us). I just don't think RGG knows that balance anymore. I also think the game design in general has taken a huge hit, just in terms of fun factor and cohesion, but that's another story...",
