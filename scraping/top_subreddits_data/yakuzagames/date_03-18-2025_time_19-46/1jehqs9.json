Last time I came here Kabukicho Tower was still under construction but now it\u2019s done it almost dominates the skyline in Shinjuku. I\u2019m just glad I didn\u2019t get pulled into any substories!",

If you want a flair that says something else, you can edit it to say something like [Discussion: Y1 spoiler] or [Majimapost: Y6 spoiler], etc. **THIS INCLUDES CONTENT FROM TRAILERS**.\n\nIf the post is not marked for spoilers, all comments that have spoilers need to be tagged \\>!like this!< along with indicating which game it's spoiling. Example: Y3 >!Kiryu sings!< \n\nIf the post flair is marked for spoilers, the comments don't need to be tagged for the game indicated and the ones before it (So a Y6 spoiler post can have comments with untagged spoilers for Y5, but not gaiden or 7). \n\nIf you see any of the above (or any of the other rules) not being followed, please report it so we can keep this place safe for newcomers and those that haven't finished all the games yet.
