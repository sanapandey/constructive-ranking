IW is an especially bad example because you have to pay an extra $15 just to try a higher difficulty and see if it actually works decently well.\n\n\nDaybreak is by far the easiest Trails game.  Quest markers have gotten so overused that you just go to a point on the map and all but automatically complete any quest.  And combat is just pressing the automatic win button the game tells you to press x number of times to win the game.\n\n\nCyberpunk's very hard feels like Mass Effect's easy.  The former's hard is like ME's very easy.  And normal to very easy is like different levels of god mode enabled.\n\n\nEven going back in time a good bit you have Skyrim where compared to, say, Morrowind you can almost completely ignore fatigue, and don't really even have the option to build any kind of strategy around it, and just have to swing your weapon in the general vicinity of any enemy for guaranteed hits until they fall.  There's very little strategy or sense of having to figure out how to outplay the CPU at all.\n\n\nI could go on but since you just asked for examples I'll leave it at that.",

As I remember it, the orphanage was struggling financially and Haruka undertook this job in order to financially sustain her step-siblings and the Morning Glory orphanage. As for Kiryu, he was told that Haruka could never become big if she was tied to Yakuza, which is a logically sound reason for him to stay away from both Morning Glory & Haruka. This is proven by the nuclear fallout seen in Y6 following outcome of the finale of Y5 when Haruka revels her ties. Additionally, Dyna Chair would pay for the orphanage while Kiryu was not there, so the children could keep living there. \n\nI don't know what life philosophy you're referring to, but Kiryu made a sacrifice for Haruka, whom he loves. He wanted her to thrive and be happy, since she expressed to Kiryu that she would be content to become involved in the idol industry (take into consideration that Kiryu can't read minds, so when Haruka said it, he probably indulged into her request). Haruka also made a sacrifice for Kiryu, whom she loved as a father, to help him keep Morning Glory alive.\n\nThis was a mutual sacrifice that could only be made by strong and resilient personalities. Just because it didn't pan out in the end does not mean that Park had evil intentions. In life, everybody identifies and tires to accomplish their own dreams, which is the laitmotif of the game. Neither Haruka, nor Kiryu were happy to be separated from each other, so they couldn't live like that anymore. I see this game as a good step toward character progression, and I cannot blame the writers for including realistic human fallacies into a video game which has proven to continuously defy logic. This is, after all, everything that I personally want from a game. To make me feel. To make me empathise.",

Think:\n\n- Kiryu was receiving a stipend from the Tojo Clan, which explains how Morning Glory was able to function in 3 and 4.\n\n- Now in 5, the orphanage is...mysteriously struggling. What happened to Daigo's support? Was it cut off after the Tojo's near-bankruptcy in 4? Then why wasn't this mentioned?\n\n- Since Daigo isn't helping them anymore, why can't Kiryu go to Akiyama for a loan? Perhaps he doesn't feel like he can ask, or maybe he doesn't want to bother him. But he *did* accept help from Daigo, so what's the difference? This isn't explained either.\n\nThe money issue also isn't explicitly brought up during Kiryu and Park's conversation. It's mentioned **once**, by Haruka, despite supposedly being the driving force behind Kiryu's decision.\n\nBecause of the above unanswered questions, this scene may be hard to believe, which allows people to dismiss it altogether. Consequently, it is assumed that Park was not merely \"providing them with an incentive\", but trying to manipulate Kiryu - which worked - so that she could get her hands on her next big moneymaker, or alternatively, so she could live vicariously through Haruka.\n\nI'm of the opinion that Park is misunderstood and overhated by this sub (I've seen some disturbing comments about her!) but RGG did not help themselves at all with their writing.",

This is unlike 5, when enemy can just break out of hitstun even from behind, or break out of grab. It's also unlike 6 or K2, where blocking enemy give you hit recoil.\n* The balancing between the Komaki skills are fantastic. Tiger Drop isn't the all powerful, and Komaki parry is amazing to use, simply because the point above: a full combo is guarateed once you start hitting enemy from behind. In 5, Komaki parry is absolutely useless, while Tiger Drop is the bane of everything.\n* Amazing wall bounce. Again, back to point 1 of enemy having proper hitstun, getting them to a wall is easy and them bouncing off the wall is just so damn fun to abuse. Oh wait, guess which Yakuza game remove all wall bouncing? Freaking Yakuza 5.\n* No inertia movement like in the Dragon Engine games. Movement is snappy, precise. Also unlike Y6 or K2, grab combo actually works.\n\nY3 seems like a piece of turd at first glance but it's actually gold when you engage more with it.

All 4 characters in Y4 are fun because the game balance enemy around all 4. Each of them feels unique, especially Akiyama and Tanimura.\n\nY5 is the case of over-polished that things become stale.

Kiryu and Saejima absolutely destroy everything by playing the most boring way (with Kiryu Tiger Drop everything into oblivion and Saejima hyper armor through everything while having a gazillion HP). Meanwhile Akiyama feels less unique like how he was in Y5, and Shinada despite a very cool design concept, suffer because elite enemies would resist grab, making his kit obsolete in any Coliseum fight.",

I'll make sure I make it to Evo for Yakuza before I post an opinion I guess. Interesting take that the game having a high skill floor makes it better. Doesn't make much sense to me to say \"the combat is better you just have to have a ton of experience playing the games before it feels fun\" \n\nYou caught that I've 100%d or near 100%d every game and had no difficulty with circumventing the blocking and doing combos in Y3 right? Like, skill was not an issue. The games combat was just boring as fuck. The combat is super clunky(do not read: hard) and the enemies all have massive health pools so they take longer than they feel like they should. Sluggish, janky gameplay where I might be able to land a sick combo by circling to the back and then wall bouncing them was *not* what made me enjoy the other 10 action games in the franchise.\n\n>Again as I have stated, no proper hitstun, no wall bounce, this mean the way you approach a battle is actually severely limited. You have a lot of moveset but there isn't really much decision making in using them due to how terrible enemies are acting.\n\nSometimes it's fun to just brawl. Yakuza 5 was good at that. It was really fun to play Shinadas combat style for instance. Did not care that I couldn't wall bounce or stun lock the shit out of people in that entry. Had a lot of fun with every character.\n\n>Kiryu and Saejima absolutely destroy everything by playng the most boring way (with Kiryu Tiger Drop everything into oblivion and Saejima hyper armor through everything while having a gazillion HP\n\nThis is why these games are not meant to be Meta-d. You're supposed to have fun fighting. If you are standing there waiting for the Tiger Drop for 100% of the time you're playing Kiryu that's on you. None of these games are nearly hard enough to mandate that you play one correct way.\n\n>suffer because elite enemies would resist grab, making his kit obsolete in any Coliseum fight.\n\nIt makes you adjust what you're doing. Which would sound like a plus for you based on your complaints about the game making you play one certain way.\n\n>What does K2 have?\n\nSnappy, fluid combat where I feel like an actual brawler in a crowd instead of a tank on rails.\n\n> Terrible Dragon Engine physics,\n\nBad physics usually make things more fun, like Oblivion. That being said, I have over 100 hours in K2 with no significant complaints about the physics.\n\n >hit recoil against blocking enemy\n\nI thought hitting enemies block was a skill issue?\n\n >grab combo doesn't work more than half the time,\n\nWhat do you even mean by this? I had no issues with the functions of the grab attacks and follow ups. Sounds like a skill issue.\n\n>every thing is revolve around entering Extreme Heat and spam special heat action, which is pretty fun I dare say, but it's shallow and gets repetitive quickly.\n\nThis is a decently fair complaint. But there are a *fuckton* of various heat actions and it's really fun to play around the more specific and rare ones.",

You seem to equate being fun = being good, and being clunky = being bad. Clunky things can be good, a lot of old school masterpiece are clunky as hell by modern standard, doesn't mean they are somehow bad now; a lot of new things are also fun to play, but also pretty shallow.\n\nIt's amazing how someone cannot see the issue with hit recoil and grab/throw combo in K2, because those 2 things are mentioned again and again in any posts/videos that analyze Y6 or K2.\n\nThere is no Yakuza game before Y6 that has hit recoil. RGG being a studio that also make fighting game (Virtua Fighter) has brought a lot of basic fighting game design into the Yakuza games. In the old engine game, having no hit recoil means that you can still finish your combo even if the enemy is guarding, because well, god forbid you have a combo finisher that can guard-break right. If enemies want to break out of blockstring, they can do their version of Komaki Knockback, which only elite enemy can do. Meanwhile in Y6, every random trash mobs you meet on the street can give you hit recoil, such fantastic design right, I wonder why starting from Lost Judgement RGG has removed this mechanic.\n\nAs for grab/throw combo, everytime during a throw animation if the enemy hurtbox interact with environmental object, the combo is dropped. Great idea right, now grab/throw combo are useless when used near walls.\n\nAnother issue with K2 is the reduction in functionalities of the light-heavy combo strings. In the old engine games, depends on how many light attack in your string, the heavy finishers can have different purpose: one can cause a short stun allow you to keep comboing, one can cause hard knock down if you want to escape from pressure and do a heat action, one can guard-break against blocking enemy or if used against non-blocking enemy it can cause a very short juggle state. These options imrprove the decision making process a lot, players now have options they can use depend on each situation they are facing. In K2 however, most strings just cause knock down. They make Kiryu animation more realistic, more pretty to look at in Y6/K2, but they stripped off all the nuance that the combo system have.",

It's not by any means hard, it's just absurdly annoying, and just makes fights take a bit longer sometimes. I beat Y3 remastered without hardly doing any side content which means less upgrades, and I did it on Normal w/out continues. I feel like you really have to take advantage of bounding (beating up enemy near wall or while they bounce off floor so they keep bouncing and you get more hits in), but sometimes your final hit doesn't knock the enemy down, and occasionally it can be difficult to get them towards a wall. If you do break their block, they often instantly reblock. And forget throwing on anyone besides scrubs on the streets because your grabs get instantly broken. You can, however, try to find Komaki's sidestory ASAP, so that you can unlock Tiger Drop, Parry, etc. very quickly. Having these will also make the game WAY easier. However you frequently have to attack the enemies once before they'll even attempt to attack you. I had several instances where I would just be standing there waiting for an enemy to attack so I could tiger drop them and they would just stand there not attacking; when I would throw out a single punch then they would attack. Just odd combat AI behavior. The story is great, though. Y4 blocking becomes a bit better but the enemies end up grabbing more.\n\n  \nANYWAYS, all of the above are my opinion, but komaki's moves and bounding are what got me through the game personally.",

However if all your worried about is hardcore street crime violence or never played a yakuza game and picked up 3 randomly back in the day you were probably disappointed, so all this yakuza 3 hate is really just people repeating opinions that people who didn\u2019t even play 1 or 2 said about 3 in like 2011 lmao, if you like yakuza you will love 3 (combat still kinda sucks a bit but it\u2019s challenging at least)",

He got beat the first fight with somewhat relative ease whilst kiryu was very old and injured. The 2nd fight was the same and the same could be said with ryuji where he lost in the elevator with the sword. Yet I\u2019d argue that Shishido was probably a tougher fight than both mine and Ryuji if you compare all their finales. \n\nRyuji had more injuries than kiryu in the last fight. I guess it was the toughness and the willpower which made Ryuji rank over mine. Mine definitely is top 5 opponents for kiryu. I also think Ryuji probably had more potential due to him also being a dragon. \n\nI\u2019m just more confused on what do they want with Ryuji. Do they want to bring him back or something? Cuz they always hint that he could be alive. They bought back kashiwagi and even Richardson so if Richardson is alive then mine could also be alive? I\u2019m not sure.",
