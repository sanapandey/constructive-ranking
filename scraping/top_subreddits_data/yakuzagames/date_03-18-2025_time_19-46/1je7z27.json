            "body": "Tachibana. My man was perhaps the only ally kiryu had during the first half of yakuza 0, when everyone wanted him dead. Tachibana gave him a place to hide, saved his ass, paid for his freedom, and offered himself to certain death to an assassin just so it doesnt finish kiryu off.\n\nAnd kiryu tried his hardest to reunite Tachibana with her sister to repay this kindness, yet feel short to do so. So when kiryu shed tears it actually feels in character; he doesnt lose control of his emotions, he let a small cry of frustration, yet he was determined to make everyone else pay.\n\nWith Rikiya though? I really never liked that relationship as it felt one sided; kiryu wanted little to nothing to do with Rikiya at the beginning, being more of a hindrance than actual help during the story, it felt like taking a dog for a walk when you want to finish your business as fast as posible. \n\nAnd then the death. Really? Is Rikiya the one kiryu cries for? We had Yumi, the single woman kiryu loved, Kazama, the fatherly figure kiryu respected despite the truth, and hell nishiki, his brother whom kiryu missed on most games, having a song in 6 where it shows he still misses him. Hell even kashiwagi died on this game but kiryu gave almost no fucks about his death, and kashiwagi was perhaps one of the few people who could understand his grief, as he knew every person important to kiryu.\n\nBut nope, it had to be Rikiya. And dont get me wrong, i dont mind men crying for when the ocassion arises, but kiryu lost it for the random, to the point even date was like \"really kiryu?\".\n\nEven Haruka in yakuza 6 when she was in a coma, kiryu was certainly pissed, but not even a tear came from his eyes. And this is haruka, the most important person in the world for him was at risk of never awaken again but kiryu doesnt cry.",

The rest of the game had already jaded me, but it was especially ridiculous here. You're telling not a single one of them thought to kick the gun away from the injured homicidal bad guy on the ground? Then the character in question just jumps in front of the bullet EXACTLY like what happened in kiwami? Not to mention I found the character in question... Just fine. Some love him/her but the only good reason I've seen is apparently some missable side content. I'm not a total Y3 hater. People definitely should not skip it like people ask all the time, but damn it has some flaws and that death scene was one of them.",
