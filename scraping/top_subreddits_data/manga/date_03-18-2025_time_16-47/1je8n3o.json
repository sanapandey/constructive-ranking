The levels of cosmic batshit insane that have led to this point, the wildly broken relationship (if you can even call it that) and yet... It all works. I mean they're on a rooftop running from crazed cultists who want to make Kubaru their god, he's madly in love with her in an increasingly broken way and she's a literal psychopath. \n\nThis is such a glorious mess. None of this bullshit \"MC/FMC are smart and reasonable people but more inept that grade schoolers at communicating so there's misunderstanding\" or \"oh noes a love triangle and MC is both an idiot and an abject pants shitting coward who is incapable of making a decision or respecting anyone elses feelings\". \n\nThey're all insane. Like legit fucking crazy. *And it's still a better love story than 99% of romcoms*. \n\nSo here for it. You go Yuuto! She's your psychopathic master! Don't share her with those stupid cultists! Just jump - you've gone over a cliff that high before, it would not be the craziest thing you've done lately.",
