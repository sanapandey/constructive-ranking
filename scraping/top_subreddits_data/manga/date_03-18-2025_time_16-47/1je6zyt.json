If you were to reread it, the parts that you liked the first time reading, you probably would still find the same enjoyment you had. Oshi no Ko is different, the ending is extremely rushed, to the point that plot points gets told not shown to save time or straight up skipped or even worse retconned for no reason at all, but the ending still feels like Oshi no Ko, it has the same tone of the previous 150 chapters. Since the start Onk was a tragedy and it ended in tragedy. If it ended in a happy ending, I would have probably been more satisfied, because in all honesty, who likes an ending where all the characters end up sad, but it wouldn't have been Oshi no Ko. I'm not satisfied with its ending, of course I would have preferred to see \\[OnK manga spoilers\\]>!Aqua alive, Kamiki and Nino rotting in jail, even though Nino still probably ended in jail !<but I'm also fine with it.",

I agree the backlash on Kaguya's ending is overblown, as I feel it always happens when a major series ends, see MYA and JJK just last year, as well as Oshi no Ko, but I feel like if OnK ended before the other 2, it's ending wouldn't be called \"the worst one yet\", they would be saying it to one of the other two, it's just the last one so it's fresher on people's minds. I'd like to refute some of your points: >!Aqua's character arc happens before Kamiki tries to get Ruby killed so it makes sense he would escalate to wanting to get rid of him at all costs. Crow-girl isn't a pointless character, she acts as the bridge between the real world and the afterlife, she the one that gets Goro and Sarina to reincarnate as Aqua and Goro, she gets Ruby in the revenge plan and she's the one that comforts Aqua while he's dying, so that he wouldn't die regretting all of his actions to that point, regretting what he did and what he could have done if he continued living, since as you said, his wish was to keep living and live his life, but instead he would die knowing the people he loved could go on even without him without worrying, as Kamiki wouldn't be around anymore. Meanwhile I wasn't really Kana's biggest fan so her storyline wasn't really something that interested me so being forgotten isn't a big deal for me, I'm more of an Akane fan. That said you're completely right about Ruby becoming Ai 2.0, it's the plot point that spoiled it the most for me and the one that I occasionally still think about.!<",
