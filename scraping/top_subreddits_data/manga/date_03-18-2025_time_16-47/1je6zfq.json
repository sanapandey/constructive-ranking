            "body": "Rocofale is so funny, must be the first time he's seen a woman in millenia, poor thing.\n\nSo Lucifer can't leave his Gehenna else he would purify all the others instantly?! He's pretty OP indeed.\n\nI like that Mr. Priest has calmed down a little from how irrational he was before. He still has tons of regrets about his comrades and anger at Imuri for deceiving him, but she just wants her to be happy all the same. I like that.\n\nSo Verge is here? I'm kinda surprised, has he given up on the whole Baba Yaga ritual? Very bold of him to show up in Beelzebub's Gehenna after deceiving him. Also, who told him Mr. Priest was going to be here? Is he working with Satan now? \n\nGuess we're going on Dante's Inferno now huh?",

Rofocale, in turn, is an anagram for \"Focalor\", the name of another demon. According to other sources, the origin of \"Rofocale\" is closely associated with the very nature of Lucifuge. Just as Lucifuge is the inverse of Lucifer (Latin for \"light-bearer\"), so the name \"Rofocale\" is derived from \"Lucifer\" reversed - that is, \"Reficul\".",
