            "body": "**<Tatoe Todokanu Ito da toshitemo>** aka **If I Could Reach You**\n\n\nBeen a while since I read this yuri series. To the point where I couldn't remember much about the details of it. This being a story of a high school girl having a long lasting one sided crush on the woman and childhood friend her older brother married, and now she lives with them thanks to complicated manga-typical parent shit. But it was also a story I didn't read in a straight shot the first time so time + wanting to see how the general vibe of the story that I did remember held up when reading it in a straight shot.\n\n\nSo. This one is by no stretch is a \"happy story\". Much less a flashy or vibrant, or even a warm touchy feely one. This is a story chonicling the whole cast of characters and the complicated and oft imprecise thing we call love and affection (and just their emotional states in general). Because nobody's relationships in this series are so straightforward. Which leads to plenty of, and many different interpretations of, angst. But it's also not of a really overblown degree either. On a certain level you can kinda get where the cast's array of complicated emotions come from and how it affects the choices they make, and their interpersonal relationships with their significant others.\n\n\nSo yeah. It's complicated story of the characters involved, but it's not one that's actually *overcomplicated* to get. If that makes sense. It's not flashy but it's got more than enough emotional substance, and a whole cast of characters who bring different kinds of that substance to the table to keep things interesting. It may not be one to everyone's taste. But if you like character driven stories where things are seldom straightforward, it's more than worth a read.\n\n\n**<Navigatoria>**\n\n\nAdmittedly this one never really was high on my priorities list as it were. But it was very intriguing for the frankly dystopic world it established. But what held this one back was that it was clearly told at a certain point that it didn't have the freedom to weave the greater story it was trying to tell and given the wrap it up sign.\n\n\nBut even so. The cast of characters all coming from their own \"Planet of...\" tvtropes settings as it were made for some interesting character dynamics to watch bounce off of each other while it lasted. You got the one guy from a brutal warmongering regime now seeing what that kind of thing looks like from an outsiders perspective. To another character who from a peaceful background getting their flip switched and making their descent into some dark territory. And frankly of all the narrative facets of this getting cut short I'm frankly miffed over seeing that one not getting to fully play out.\n\n\nAnd then of course everything with Navi and the whole deck stacked against her.\n\n\nBut I guess I'm just rambling now. Point is, pity this one had to be so tragically cut short. Cuz this one weaved a good worldbuilding enough to keep me on my toes about where it was gonna go with it.\n\n\n**<Benkei in New York>**\n\n\n7 short stories of a man named Benkei. An artist, who also happens to be a hitman. Sometimes sought after by the mafia, but often sought after for those seeking revenge.\n\n\nMakes for a decent but stort noir read.\n\n\n\n**<To Heart>**\n\n\nWell, this was a relaxing bit of larger than life SoL romance. Considering two characters in here are gynoids. But it's an easygoing story of a nice high school guy being nice and helping his fellow students (though pretty much exclusively the female ones) with their problems, with his childhood friend who not so secretly loves him with him every step of the way.\n\n\nStill. This one really feels like a condensed version or just a vignettes version of a much larger story/franchise. It makes for an afternoon read. But it does give off the vibe of that there's a whole lot more to the worldbuilding at large than what's being said. You know what I mean.",

Already caught up on Weakest Tamer, Wistoria, Reincarnated as a Sword, Azur Lane (Akagi2), Catgirl and Doctor, Cockroa-chan, Reincarnated as a Slime (and their spinoffs), Reincarnated as a Sword, Cells at Work! Baby, and My Giant Nerd Boyfriend.\n\nPlot is optional, don't care if it's an American webcomic, Japanese manga, or Korean Manhwa, as long as it has an English translation. Not in the market for anime, I got a huge backlog of that, already.",

I didn't expect much from it, but the MAL rating was good, and I don't know how, but this has got me hooked for 3 straight days whenever I'm free. It's based on a real man's experiences in a manga form, so the characters and narrative do feel very real-life-like, unlike \"manga\". Do give it a try. It's wholesome, funny and I got invested in it. hopefully you will too.",
