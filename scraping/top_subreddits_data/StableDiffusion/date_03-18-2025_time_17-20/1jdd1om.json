Download the standalone installer from that website. **Make sure you go to the website linked on the git page**\n\n\nI reinstalled 4 times because the git archive kept breaking things (like the manager) but so far the standalone installer seems to be working okay",

In some of the other comments you're saying that's it's not particularly difficult.  This is a product imo.  I remember looking at old photo albums of my parents and grandparents and I think, this is fun and I'd do it if I'm visiting someone and the albums are right there... but with everything being digital now, would I ever like browse my grandma's Facebook photos?  Just be sitting bored as a 13 year old with my cousins and, \"let's look at your mom's Facebook profile!\"  I can't see that ever happening.  But if it was like magic Harry Potter books that brought the photos to life and had a soundtrack attached... I could see that being a thing people would want to engage with.",
