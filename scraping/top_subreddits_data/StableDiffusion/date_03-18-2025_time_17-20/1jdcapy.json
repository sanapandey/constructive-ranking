I rented an RTX A6000 and the VRAM usage peaked at about 40GB. The project is quite rough around the edges and restricted to very specific resolutions. It's possible to edit the code and make it work with vertical resolutions, but it will be squished if it isn't something compatible with 1024x576 or vice versa.",
