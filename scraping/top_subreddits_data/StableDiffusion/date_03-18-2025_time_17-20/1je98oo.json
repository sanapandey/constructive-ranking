My mom had religious psychosis, apparently 1 year into my sister's existence, God sent my mother a vision promising her my sister would be healed and grow up normal, she claimed to have had a vision of her playing like a normal kid in a field. This was before my mother's insane/abusive behavior had driven my dad away and become targeted towards her other children. My dad was still in the \"I would do anything to comfort you\" kind of love. My dad was always a tech guy, I could legit see a younger and naiver him using this technology to try and comfort the love of his life. To make that \"vision\" a photorealistic reality to try and bring her peace. It scares me to think about. I don't know if my mom could have ever gotten over the grief/psychosis if she had actually SEEN a video of what she claimed she so clearly saw. It took her almost a decade to recover from the grief/psychosis.!<\n\nThe man-made horrors we are currently witnessing are unfortunately very comprehendible.
