We promise to open model weights instantly when\u00a0**reaching a certain stardust level**\u00a0(The stardust % can go above 100%).\u00a0**Different models require different Stardust thresholds**, especially advanced ones.\u00a0For 3.5vpred and future models, the goal will be increased to ensure sustainability.\n\nBut the question everyone asked still remained: How much stardust do they want?\n\nThey STILL didn't define any specific goal; the words keep changing, and people are confused since no one knows what the point is of raising 100% if they keep their mouths shut without communicating with supporters.\n\nSo yeah, I'm very disappointed.\n\n\\+ For more context, 300,000 Stardust is equal to $2100 (atm), which was initially set as the 100% goal for the model.",

They are angry because you are doing it very wrong.\n\nRelease the model at 100%.Add discord benefits to supporters for over 100%. Tell that you will release training tricks for everyone at 150%. Release LoRA models and Controlnets at 200%. Literally anything.",

Or at the very least, a clear statement on *exactl*y how much community support they need for an exact release date.\n\nI knew something was fucky when they listed both the v3.0 vpred and v3.5 vpred models right next to each other, both for 300k stardust. Like... why would anybody contribute to 3.0 vpred? And listing for effectively $3000 when it costed them $180k to train? How does that make sense? And both of these things were listed before 2.0 is even available? They really seem to have no idea what they're doing. \n\nWill be excited to play around with it if/when it launches. Until then, not holding my breath.",

Why give each model its own copy-pasted funding goal instead of just having a single $10k target with stretch goals like every normal crowdfunding project out there?

The decision on which threshold to release the model is not on him but his company (onamaiAI). From what i can tell there is a gross miscommunication between the company and a 3rd party who made the website which lead to so many inconsistencies It's borderline comedy. Moreover the majority of the donation for v3.5 vpred (at least 75%) come from one person and they are already in contact with angel (Also let's be real, 2k dollars is almost chump change in term of whether one can push this into an actual legal lawsuit). It's likely that the actual number will be announced tomorrow in korean office hours as they will probably need to think long and hard for this clusterfuck and a half of a pr disaster they are in",
