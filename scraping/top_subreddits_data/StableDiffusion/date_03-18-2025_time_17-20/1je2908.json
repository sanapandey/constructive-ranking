    "selftext": "6 years back I made a block crafting application, where we can tap on blocks and make a 3D model (search for AmeytWorld). I shelved the project after one month of intensive dev and design in Unity . Last year I repurposed it to make AI images of #architecture using #stablediffusion . Today I extended it to make flyby videos using Luma Labs AI  and generating 3D models for #VirtualReality and #augmentedreality. \n\nP.S: Forgive the low quality of the 3d model as this is a first attempt. \n",
