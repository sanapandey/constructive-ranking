    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nDoes anyone know of existing methods or models (ideally compatible ComfyUI) that support conditioning video upscaling based on a reference high-res frame (e.g., the first frame)? The goal is to upscale the output of Wan2.1 I2V (which is downscaled for performance reasons) using the original high-res input image as a conditioning signal.\u00a0 I have tried methods like Upscale by Model node, Tile controlnet, SUPIR, but have not managed to get decent results. Any relevant insights and workflows would be appreciated.\u00a0\n\nThanks in advance!",
