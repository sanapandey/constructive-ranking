In Reno and Vegas tourism and hospitality are huge parts of the economy, but those industries earn us much more gentrification than good wages. Then there\u2019s our more rural areas, which are shockingly not as cheap as you\u2019d think. In fact, Elko is the most expensive part of the state because of money from mining. People doing administrative work for the industry live large but the service jobs that support them aren\u2019t paid nearly enough to keep up. Add to that the fact that we\u2019re a tax haven and most of the new housing we build is for rich people moving from out of state, and we\u2019re just plain fucked.",
