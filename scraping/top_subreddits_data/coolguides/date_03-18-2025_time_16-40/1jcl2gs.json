Best example here is the sirloin - one gets the impression of it being situated somehow like a continuation of the flank towards the back \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 when it in fact originates from the ventral part of the spine and the  inside of the pelvis a runs from there through the back part of the abdominal cavity towards the upper medial part of the femur.Get these guides correct!!!!",
