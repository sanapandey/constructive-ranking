            "body": "Wow I actually got cancer from this post.  Stage IV.  I'm fucked.\n\nBut really, this is inaccurate and labeled as \"the truth\" which bothers me.\n\n* Bittersweet moments don't have joy.  They're sad moments wrapped in a layer of knowledge that overall things are better, or happy moments wrapped in a layer of contextual sadness.  Joy cannot be bittersweet.\n\n* Anxiety and excitement are the same thing with different interpretations.  They have all the same physiological effects like alertness, heightened heart rate, potentially sweating or shaking.  Anticipation is waiting for something expected to happen.  Anxiety is worrying about what could happen, even unexpected things.  Excitement is welcoming something that is about to happen.\n\n* Anger and compassion make assertiveness?!  Fuck, I'm not doing this whole list.  Assertiveness takes neither anger nor compassion.  It usually requires being *dispassionate* and calm.\n\n* Fear and curiosity make caution?  No.  Curiosity is wanting to find out.  Caution is being ready in case of something bad.  Fear is expecting or knowing something bad is already happening or about to happen.  No overlap.\n\n* Confusion is not part of realization.  They literally cannot exist together.  Clarity and realization are the same thing in this context.\n\n* Hope and doubt are determination?  Ugh, no, they're literally not, and they're such common words that I'm starting to feel bad because whoever made this must not speak English as a first language.\n\n* Trust and letdown is skepticism?  No, if you trust, you're not skeptical.  If you've been let down before and you're skeptical, you don't trust.  Skeptical is literally a lack of trust.  The feeling of being let down has a name: disappointment.\n\n* Love and loss making grief is the first one that makes any sense, good job.\n\n* Pride and humility make balance?  Wow, back to bullshit I see.  Balance isn't an emotion.  Pride and humility don't have overlap.\n\n* Guilt and forgiveness are on two different axes.  You can't have forgiveness without guilt.  Redemption is a different thing than forgiveness.  You can forgive someone who isn't redeemed.\n\n* I've had burnout, and I'm not that ambitious a person.  Fatigue is a component of burnout though, so good job?\n\n* I don't think courage is about confidence.  It is about vulnerability for sure, but I think it would make more sense to be determination plus fear or determination plus vulnerability.\n\n* Gratitude and envy make contentment?  I think if you're content there is no envy, only gratitude.\n\n* Resilience doesn't come from peace or from uncertainty.  Resilience comes from hardship.  This is the worst one.\n\n* Joy and fear again, huh?  Oh, and excitement again.  Yeah I don't think excitement needs any fear aspect.  It's a positive emotion but I don't think it typically gets to the point of joy.  Joy is about something happening or that has just happened.  Excitement is about something upcoming.\n\nWow, I did the whole list, and it turns out I'm now at stage V with my cancer.  I feel such...assertiveness",

It is about vulnerability for sure, but I think it would make more sense to be determination plus fear or determination plus vulnerability.\n\nSo yeah, just taking \"courage\" for instance, several century ago, courage would means \"the courage to face adversity\", it would means to go fight a dragon, even if not fully prepared.. by dragon I mean an obvious menace to you or the community, usually in a physical sense which require a fight where there is no rule that get enforced. It wasn't about letting other known that you are a vulnerable person or someone which could be easily hurt by something, that some part of you are lacking defense against particular attack. In such context, yeah determination with fear would make much more sense.. even if perhaps, you had to known your vulnerability in order to conceal or cover them in some way for fighting the threat... yet in such context, not letting known your enemy an your vulnerabilities, was just part of being wise. If you were to be giving that information tho, it would certainly lead to a purest form of fight with no hidden information... providing that you had similar information against the enemy. But at this point, this is more about honor that courage.\n\nYet of course, in modern time... yeah, it could be associated most often in dating context, which can lead to pair up confidence and vulnerability in order to get enough courage and show your interest to someone in particular way which contain some form of risk against some degree of mental wellness/comfort, self-worth, possible social-link, etc. So yeah, in this context vulnerability has a place.. yet such scenario is only a subset of what the courage spectrum could means.\n\nThis guide could be dangerous for the real meaning of the word. From a linguistic perspective, it's over-simplify those term and can be misleading.. sure there is some component that can apply sometime, but it's still quite wrong. At best, perhaps the dictionary could have word to deal with these particular context where those make sense.. but that would miss the point of this guide about making \"emotion\" simpler to understand.",
