Plants per acre was wayyyy under most production vineyards (+/- 1000 is more common).  .25 to . 30#/cluster for most popular varieties.  5 tpa= about 4000 bottles/acre.  On 8x5 spacing, each vine can make 3.27 bottles of wine.  \n\nLong story short, the cost of fruit alone in a bottle of wine is about 1.875$ USD  at 5 tpa, $1500/ton, 160 gallons/ton.  The materials for bottle/cork/capsule/label are about equally priced for low-mid range bottles.  Winemaking costs, storage/aging, marketing, distribution, store markups.... They make up the majority of the cost of a bottle(from lowest cost to highest).  The same concept applies to other alcohols like beer and cider.  \n\nGives you something to think about with the value of your dollar knowing that the breakdown of your cost for convenience and luxury.  FYI, when you buy a bottle of wine at a store, the % of the cost you're paying that goes to the distributor is far, far, far more than what is paid to the winery, and even less to the farmer who grew it.",
