They get massive, intermix with all your other garden plants, and they taste excellent. Dehydrate them and vac seal, they last forever. Super easy for basically any level of grower\n\n* Pholiota adiposa or Chestnuts are also on my top tier. They're like shitake and buttons had a baby - excellent flavor profile, pretty easy to grow once you get the hang of it.",
