For many decades they knew they wouldn\u2019t be able to hold the territory so they would loot and withdraw back south into the Levant or wherever the border was at that time in the mountains north of it (modern day Turkey). This went on for decades in sort of a stalemate following the initial success of the caliphate\u2019s conquests while the Romans were not strong enough to offer battle to the Jihadists. They would alternatively let the jihadists pillage and then ambush in mountain passes as the jihadists return home with loot in order to salvage some of the lost loot and stolen citizens that were to be slaves or hostages for trade\n\nDuring this period, the seasonal Muslim pillaging caused citizens of Anatolia to bury their valuables in order to protect it from raiders. That\u2019s why we find so much buried gold and artifacts there. \n\nAll this is to say, there is the romantic definition of Jihad, then there is the corrupted reality of jihad.

To say that historically wars are not fought over religion removes probably 1/4-1/3 of all war. Is it all of it? No, but it also isn't none.\n\nThe original rules, as described in OP's picture were based on moral values, not to retain financial or land value in the event of a victory. I know we're all jaded by recent events of the last 100 years or so but come on... It's pretty clear that your view on the reasons for these rules is completely out of touch with historical reality. A just and Godly society relies on moral guidance above the value of worldy items, the wars fought over land/resources/power are started by immoral and greedy people while hiding behind religion. It's like people using Jesus as a reason to hate gay people. The \"war\" against homosexuality uses Christianity and Islam, etc. as an excuse to treat other humans terribly, when their own religious texts strictly instruct followers to treat their neighbors as family. Even if it is considered a sin, it directly contradicts explicit rules. Evil people are evil, no matter what they say they believe.\n\nIslam was once a religion of peace, tolerance, and science, but it has devolved into a barbaric bastardization of the original texts and philosophies. Most religions have become this over time because people like to use their beliefs as a shield to allow them to believe they are still on the moral high ground for the terrible shit they do.",

Our tradition to have maintained these chains and logs of transmission from antiquity to today is actually kind of impressive. These recorded chains are also used to debate and question the Hadith across hundreds of years. The quick spread of islam within the first 100 years all the way to Morocco to Pakistan makes a contamination nearly impossible. I guess theres a small chance, and I dont wanna be that religious \"this is fundamentally true blah blah\" guy but imo its pretty reasonable to assume the version every Muslim reads today is the same version the prophet revealed",

Religions that have very fuzzy requirements that mostly have teaching in parables and vague ideals (post-reformation Christianity, Buddhism, Shinto) tend to be more easily interpreted into a progressive mindset and liberal society.\n\nReligions that are treated as doctrine and demand absolute subservience tend to have more issues with that (Islam, pre-reformation Christianity, etc).\n\nOne of the problems is that in the time of \"holy wars\", it's fairly universal that the church dominated and/or controlled the state.\n\nThis is absurdly dangerous.\n\nModern reformed Christianity generally disavows control over the state.  \"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's\" and Christianity's core text is mostly spoken in parables about being a good person and not judging others.\n\nIt's much easier, as with Buddhism and Christianity, to convince people to interpret their vague text more openly. On the other hand, Islam explicitely demands the state to be subsumed by the religion and that non-religious be murdered.  It's very difficult to convince religious people that explicite statements in their own holy text should be ignored in a reformation.\n\n> Kill the polytheists wherever you find them, and take them captive, and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. For Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n> Quran 9:5\n\nAs a person who vaguely identifies as polythiest, that's a bit disturbing.  I don't know how much \"what about this oner person who's totally nice\" I could accept, when this is clear and unequivocally stated in the namesake text of the religion (it's not even a Hadith, open to interpretation).",

In these cases, however, the religion associated with terrorism was Christianity. In ad- dition to the terrorism associated with both Catholic and Prostestant sides in Northern Ireland, recent incidents of Christian terrorism include the shootings at a Jewish day care center in California on August Io, I999, the r996 bombing of the Atlanta Olympic Games, the r995 devastation of the Oklahoma City federal building, and a rash of abor- tion clinic attacks throughout the r990s. My attempt to understand contemporary religious violence around the world begins with these Christian examples. Although much of the world's attention has been riveted to incidents in the Middle East, I have chosen to initiate my search with a phenomenon that most American readers will find both familiar and strange: Christian militancy in the West. What is familiar is the setting. What is strange is the idea that religious warfare exists in some of the most modern of twentieth-century societies. Also surprising, at least to some, is that terrorist acts have been justified by Christian principles.\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=lpb1mbaHjGQC&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA19&hl=en&source=gb_mobile_entity#v=onepage&q&f=false",

Actually kind of a big problem with Islam is how codified it is. It makes it's reformation far more difficult, hence it's collision with modernity is much more difficult to navigate.\n\nAll that said, how it's \"supposed\" to be interpreted, and how people will choose to interpret it needn't coincide at all.

First of all, there are no contradictions in the Quran. That is what the Quran itself states and what Muslims believe. Contradictions stem from interpretation. One example of a principle of interpretation is generalization. The Quran often does not explicit what is a generalizable command and what is not. Commands often have a limited scope as they are revelation instructing a group of individuals in the prophets time on how to deal with a specific situation they were facing. \"Kill them whereever you find them\" is a famous example. Who is \"them\" and who is this command directed towards? To simply take that verse and generalize it so that it applies to any believer against any non-believer results in contradictions with many other verses. Not to mention the Quran makes exceptions and those exceptions arent always in the same chapter or section of the chapter as the command.\n\nSimply put abrogation applies when a new command is given that is of greater specificity or generality/scope. The commandment still must not be contradictory. A famous example, is the one where God first prohibits praying while drunk. Later God prohibits drinking completely/all together. You see, at first God did not prohibit drinking outside of prayer. God did not say anything about it. He did not explicitly say its ok to drink outside of prayer. He did not say you are allowed to drink outside of prayer. He only said you cannot join prayer while drunk. The reason for this is that that was a command to get people to adjust slowly before dropping the hammer on drinking alcohol. If you pray 5+ times a day, then you have to be sober at 5 separate times during the day. They were not forced to quit completely cold turkey but they had to be more responsible about it. Then, later, when got commanded to not drink at all, it was easier for the Muslims to adjust. Regardless, not being drunk does not contradict with not drinking at all. Presumably, if you dont drink at all, you will never be in a drunken state and thus, you cannot pray while drunk. But, then, which command applies to Muslims now? The time-frame of the first command (not praying while drunk) has expired and so the command that came later is the last operating command. It is thus deemed that the later verse abrogates the earlier one. The later does not eliminate the former (you cannot now pray while being in a drunken state), it only adds to it or completes it.\n\nAbrogation has many requirements.\n\n\\- Contradiction has nothing to do with it (because Muslims believe there are no contradictions in the Quran). \n\n\\- The verses must be related in topic, but differ in specificity or scope\n\n\\- And there are more requirements\n\nNote that most Islamic scholars believe there are 7-9 abrogated verses. Extremists play loose with the rules and let their desired interpretations (driven by their earthly aims) motivate their abuse of abrogation to eliminate very fundamental, first principle verses from applying to today (famous example: The verse that says there is no compulsion in religion. They claim that this verse is abrogated and end up disabling like a 100+ verses as a result). Their interpretations of the verses in the Quran results in many contradictions and in the end, they select what they want to be true for worldly aims. The latter is in my opinion, the difference between Salafism and Wahabism.",

Here are some clarifcations:  \n\nThe creation of man is described in diffrent ways because it refers to different stages. Adam was created from clay or dust, while human reproduction happens through a sperm-drop, which then develops into a clot of blood. These are not contradicitons but complemntary descriptions of different phases of human creation.  \n\nThe Quran explictly states that there is no compulsion in religion. Verses that mention fighting refer to historical contexts where Muslims were under attack. They are about self-defnse, not forced convresions.  \n\nEvery prophet was the first to submit to God in his own time. Moses, Abraham, and Muhammad all declared themsleves the first believers within their respective contexts. This does not mean there is a contridiction, just different moments in history.  \n\nGod does not forgive polythesim if a person dies without repentance. However, if someone repents, they are forgiven, just as the Israelites were forgiven after worshipping the golden calf. The condtion is sincere repentence.  \n\nGod\u2019s final words cannot be changed, but earlier revelatons were replaced by later ones for the purpose of guidance. This is called abrogation and was necessary as the Quran was revealed over 23 years, adressing different sitations.  \n\nPharaoh drownd, but his body was preserved as a sign for future generations. The two statements do not contradict each other but describe both his death and the preservation of his corpse.  \n\nWine is prohibited on earth due to its harmfull effects, but the wine in paradise is described as pure and without negative consequences. The Quran distingushes between the two, so there is no contradicton.  \n\nMost of these so-called contradctions come from taking verses out of context or ignoring the full pictrue :)",

If it\u2019s everybody, then it\u2019s not really a religion anymore, since there is no solid doctrine to be followed.

If it\u2019s nobody, then that text should hold no value and shouldn\u2019t be evangelised.  \n\nAnd sure, texts can be amended, supplemented or adjusted for guidance, but that also is in contradiction to the original \u201cword of the lord\u201d. Is the Jewish faith wrong, because they don\u2019t have a new testament, which in this scenario could be seen as an addendum to the Old Testament. \n\nThe Vatican is famous for editing, deleting or losing scriptures throughout the ages because the texts were not in line with their ideology at the time. Hell, just look at what Joseph Smith has performed with Mormonism. The Old Testament said \u201c1 man, 1 wife, and a couple of side-chicks are okay\u201d. Then later, the pope and Christian groups were saying: \u201cnah dude, monogamy is the way, otherwise it\u2019s hell for you.\u201d But I believe Joseph Smith really just wanted to bang some more, so he proclaimed himself a prophet and added polygamy (and other things of course) back on the menu. \n\nSo what is there still to believe? Why do you believe a prophet was actually visited by a diety and not just some Bronze Age influencer chasing clout?\n\nI honestly appreciate the explanations and personal views you are giving, but as an atheist with a Christian upbringing, I really don\u2019t buy all the religious bullshit and \u201cguidelines on how to live your life because a fictitious deity said so\u201d.

For individuals interested in the history of how imperialism took over Islam, look up events that\u2019s led to the event of Karbala. Study the events that led to it and the events that followed it. Islam and imperialism are antagonistic in essence, however all you see in Islamic history after the prophets death is grabbing of power and expansion hiding behind the cloak of islam! I promise you the information is all there but requires one to scrutinize and study the past without prejudice and try to seek the truth. Good luck.",

Why then should that not be their right particularly when so many broke the rules to come to their shores and they only opened up out of kindness, recognizing the desperation of the situation that they were led to believe existed in Syria (never mind that many of the people who came weren't actually from Syria).",

It's been is centuries, since you've heard that sort of talk from Christian leaders and even if you want to try to suggest that Hitler was some how a Christian (which I categorically reject as his effort wasn't at all about advancing Christianity) then even in that example, you would have to admit that it was Christian nations who were predominantly rhe omes who stepped up to stop him, thus further demonstrating that this wasnt the modern Christian world behaving as we see with islam today.",

Now I had a Reddit moment (I'm famous!). I cannot answer to all the comments, since there are too many. I will summarize it here instead.\n\nSo. ISIS are Muslims, there's no doubt about it (outside of Reddit! Well, that's as per usual, I suppose). But do they stand for all Muslims? -- Highly unlikely!  Do they behave like most Muslims? -- Seems very doubtful too.  So, what's the deal?  -- They are Muslim fundamentalists.  This means that they are a specific kind of Muslims who interpret the scripture very literally, reject auxiliary texts and try to recreate some fantasy system that they believe to be a historically accurate description of the old Muslim world (because their ethics system is so literal, they believe that the moral laws written in the scripture must be practiced in the exact way they are written, but since the rules were written a long time ago, there's no good way to apply them to the world today, therefore the world today must change (regress) so that the rules can be applied again).\n\nTo the Reddit experts who don't like to use dictionaries and encyclopedias: The above explanation doesn't describe *all* Muslims as equivalent to ISIS.  Fundamentalism usually doesn't represent the majority of a religion with a long history and many followers.  Such religions tend to fracture and adjust themselves to the environment in which they need to be practiced, which necessitates reinterpretation of the scripture, usually in a more symbolic / figurative way.  The humanism of the Western world became the predominant \"folk\" ethics system, and most religions that coexist with this ethics system keep adjusting themselves in order to survive.  This is how slavery, even though abundant in the texts of Abrahamic religions is outlawed today (but it's perfectly conceivable that there could be, eg. a Christian fundamentalist group that would practice slavery, and they would still be valid Christians!). Same thing with polygamy, abortions, divorces, women rights and so on. This universal shift towards humanism is what renders religious fundamentalists as extremists (which is also typical of sects that can branch out from a more orthodox religion).  This is what explains the confusion, where people who don't like dictionaries and definitions believe that ISIS is an extremist sect, and could be discounted as not Muslim.\n\nThere are some examples of sects in Islam, Bahai, or... recently I was walking by the train station and saw a booth with some youth circling it with t-shirts saying \"Muslims for Jesus Christ\".  Not sure if that's an actual thing, but let's say it was: those would be examples of an actual sect that split from the more mainstream version of religion and went so far as to not be associated with the parent religion anymore.",

How long before the assaults and talk about killing those that don't fit their agenda becomes mass murder and destruction of other religions holy places?  \n\nI'm not stupid enough to think that I wasn't just lucky that I had people with me that got me out of harms way.  LGBTQ people ARE being murdered in higher numbers, you just can't, or won't, see it because it's not plastered everywhere.  Try looking around at what is happening, and how ISIS and Nazis took power and how it looked at the beginning of their regimes and not at the end.  We're in phase 2 right now, the really evil stuff comes at phase 4, phase 3 is when people start vanishing or falling out of windows.  Just watch.",

Being a fundamentalist means rejecting any non-literal interpretations of the scripture.  Eg. Christian fundamentalists cannot accept the notion of dinosaurs not living at the same time as humans because that would literally contradict the scripture. Do most Christians believe that (non-avian) dinosaurs died some 50 millions of years ago, way before any humans were alive? -- yes! But this doesn't make those who believe in \"young Earth\" any less Christians.  That's why we have a word for it: \"fundamentalists\".",

There's literally no basis in the religion for those beliefs.\n\n\nWhat there is enormous basis for in Islam, however, is trying to emulate Muhammed in every facet of your being. Because he is literally the perfect man in the eyes of Allah.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd who was he? Well, he was a pedophile, a slaver and a conquering warlord, who spread his religion with the sword for his own personal gain.\u00a0\n\n\nSo then the actions of the Islamic State make a little more sense. The thing is that those guys were no slouches at all when it comes to Islamic scripture. Any moderate/liberal Imam would have an extremely tough time trying to argue against their actions based purely on Islamic scripture and theology.",

But western countries also do the right thing as well at times, and so each act should be reviewed. Islamic terrorism, on the other hand, does not get the benefit of that scrutiny. Terrorism is never justified and should be universally decried. My issue is that all of Islam doesn\u2019t do it, and in fact, a huge percentage doesn\u2019t do it.",

Nelson Mandela was officially a terrorist according to the US. Gandhi was called a terrorist by the British. The US is officially deporting people for \"terrorism\" if they say mean **words** about Israel. Speaking of Israel, they consider attacks on their soldiers to be terrorism, when it would be much more fairly described as an act of war, but they know that the t-word gets more sympathy and allows them to cast those they occupy as permanent villains rather than people resisting occupation (which the West would  call heroic in circumstances that benefit their geopolitical position, see Ukraine, Afghan resistance against the USSR, etc).\n\nNone of this should be construed as a defense of war crimes, my point is that, for instance, from the perspective of a Palestinian being pushed off their land by the IDF, \"terrorism\" is being done ***TO*** them.",

I care, quite simply, about tyranny.

                                                    "body": "Does ISIS Represent True Islam?\n\nYour post makes a fair distinction between Muslim fundamentalists and the broader Muslim population, but there are a few key points that need clarification:\n\n1. ISIS Is Not Just Fundamentalist\u2014They Are a Deviant, Sectarian Offshoot\n\nWhile ISIS claims to follow a strict, literal interpretation of Islam, they reject mainstream Islamic scholarship, including centuries of legal and theological tradition. Their ideology is not just fundamentalist; it is a sectarian deviation that has been condemned by the vast majority of Islamic scholars.\n\n* All major Sunni and Shia religious institutions have denounced ISIS as heretical.\n\n* ISIS cherry-picks scripture, ignoring core principles of justice, mercy, and legal procedure in Islam.\n\n* They ignore scholarly consensus (Ijma)\u2014which has always been a key part of Islamic jurisprudence.\n\n2. Fundamentalism Doesn\u2019t Always Mean Extremism\n\nYou correctly point out that fundamentalists interpret scripture literally and reject modern re-interpretation. But not all fundamentalists are violent extremists like ISIS.\n\n* Salafism, Wahhabism, and Deobandism are often labeled \u201cfundamentalist,\u201d yet not all their followers advocate violence.\n\n* Many orthodox Jews and Christians are also fundamentalists, but that doesn\u2019t automatically make them terrorists.\n\n* ISIS goes beyond fundamentalism\u2014they actively justify and promote mass violence, slavery, and genocide, which most fundamentalists reject.\n\n3. The \u201cIslamic World Must Regress\u201d Argument is Flawed\n\nYou mention that ISIS believes the world must regress to fit their interpretation of scripture\u2014this is partly true, but they are also modern in many ways:\n\n* They use the internet, social media, and digital propaganda to spread their ideology.\n\n* They rely on modern warfare tactics and financial networks, including cryptocurrencies.\n\n* Their vision isn\u2019t just about returning to the past\u2014it\u2019s about creating a violent totalitarian state that controls every aspect of life.\n\n4. ISIS Is Not a Fringe Sect Like Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed\n\nYou compare ISIS to sects like the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith or \u201cMuslims for Jesus\u201d, but there is a critical difference:\n\n* Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed peacefully diverged from Islam and does not claim to be part of it.\n\n* ISIS falsely claims to be \u201ctrue Islam\u201d while violently opposing all other Muslims\u2014especially Sunni scholars who reject them.\n\n5. Islam, Like Other Religions, Has Always Evolved\n\nYou correctly point out that all major religions have evolved under changing social conditions. Islam is no different:\n\n* Slavery was abolished in the Islamic world despite being mentioned in historical texts.\n\n* Women\u2019s rights expanded despite medieval rulings restricting them.\n\n* Religious minorities thrived under Islamic rule at various points in history.\n\nISIS rejects this historical reality and instead fabricates a myth of a \u201cpure\u201d Islamic past that never existed.\n\nAlso\u2026 \n\nYour main point\u2014that ISIS is Muslim but doesn\u2019t represent most Muslims\u2014is accurate\u2026\nHowever:\n\n1. ISIS is not just fundamentalist; they are a violent, sectarian offshoot that disregards Islamic scholarship.\n2. Fundamentalism \u2260 Extremism\u2014most fundamentalists do not commit acts of terror.\n3. ISIS is not about regression\u2014it\u2019s about authoritarian control using religion as a tool.\n4. ISIS is not just a \u201csect\u201d\u2014they are a self-declared terrorist organization, universally condemned by Islamic scholars.\n\nThe confusion comes from people conflating Muslim fundamentalism with violent extremism, when in reality, ISIS operates outside mainstream Islamic tradition and legal authority.\n\nToward conclusion\u2026 \n\nThe vast majority of Islamic scholars and organizations have unequivocally condemned ISIS as a heretical sect that violates the fundamental principles of Islam. In reality, the biggest victims of ISIS have been Muslims themselves, particularly in Iraq, Syria, and other conflict zones.\n\nIn short, fundamentalists who reject peaceful verses ignore the historical, contextual, and doctrinal reality of Islam. Instead, they create a violent ideology that has no legitimate basis in true Islamic teachings.\n\nFundamentalists who claim that ISIS represents the \u201ctrue\u201d version of Islam, while dismissing peaceful verses as \u201clies\u201d or \u201cmistakes,\u201d are deliberately falsifying Islamic teachings to justify violence.\n\nWhy Is Their Narrative False?\n\n1.\t\u2060Selective Quoting \u2013 ISIS and similar groups cherry-pick verses about conflict while ignoring the historical context and legal rules of warfare in Islam.\n2.\t\u2060Ignoring Islam\u2019s Core Principles \u2013 Traditional teachings emphasize justice, the protection of innocent lives, and the prohibition of killing civilians, women, and children.\n3.\t\u2060Breaking the Principle of \u201cIjma\u201d (Scholarly Consensus) \u2013 For over 1,400 years, the majority of Islamic scholars have interpreted Islam as a religion of peace and coexistence.\n\nHow Does ISIS Twist Islam?\n\n1.\t\u2060ISIS relies on an extreme, narrow interpretation that rejects centuries of Islamic legal scholarship.\n2.\t\u2060They disregard the authority of classical scholars, who have long maintained that Islam promotes peaceful coexistence.\n3.\t\u2060They use ideology as a political tool, recruiting followers through fear, misinformation, and manipulation.",

Every person who was following prophet noah, abraham, moses, jesus is as Muslim as any following prophet Muhammad-SAW. It's the same religion, not new but, in fact, continuation\n\nMost of the muslims also try to differentiate them from Judaism and Christianity, but it's incorrect. Yes, people who have invented/changed or not following holy scriptures or books are among all of the religions. Just because of them, we can not judge the whole religion\n\n\n\n>But surely it's fine to loudly pray to Muhammad during Christian festivities, right?\n\nThere is nothing wrong for any follower of Islam to praise prophets before whether it's jesus, marry, abraham and all. In fact, its mandatory for muslims to respect and believe all previous prophets\n\nTherefore, any praise during festivities for any prophet shall be respected. And not necessarily that muslims start in arabic they can praise even in local language for the same prophets.\n\n>there are a lot of Muslim extremists who do not practice what they claim to preach.\n\nWhat I have observed being muslim that most of muslims are only chery picking and just exercising religion what they heard or saw their elders doing. There are tons of instructions (including not to follow blindly elders) which muslims similar to other religions skip and just only stick to those which suits them. Therefore, God knows all, and such people are not following the religion of prophets but, in fact, spreading fasad (mischief and riot), and God will punish them.\n\nUnfortunately, if you tell this to any muslim, they will get offended, and then you show them quran, and they will start finding excuses to interpret differently. No doubt they are not deceiving anyone but themselves\n\nEdit: forgot to answer sharia part\n\nSharia is not as muslims think it's way of life and it shall start from themselves and Sharia is simply rule of holy book revealed upon prophets and every religion ask people to follow instructions given by God and most of the part is to person himself/herself and after that it's for others. Unfortunately, most of the people will use religion when it benefits them but will skip when it's against their interests.\n\nSharia can not be implemented it's adopted. If every individual start following religion and adopt in their life then if anyone exceeds the limit and snatch others right then instructions to be implemented by state to restore that and secure others right and punish the one who overstep/snatch others right",

(Qur'an 21:57-58)\nWhen we questioned, he made fun of them, left the largest idol intact and said \"that idol did it\" basically (Qur'an 21:59-63). Then when people tried to kill him for destroying the idol by burning him alive, Allah saves him (keeping in mind that Islamically speaking, defacing the Qur'an leads to a harsh punishment as we've seen) (Qur'an 21:68-70).\n\nMuhammad also destroyed idols himself (Sahih Bukhari 3020 and 2478).\n\nSince the picture uses Hasan Hadith, I'll also use the same source and mention how he also presumably planned to expel all Jews from Arabia and wanted no one in Arabia but Muslims (Sunan Abu Dawood 3025 but Sahih Muslim 2284 also says the same)\n\nYou can make any implications you wish from that. It's true that some temples were left intact with treaties as the islamic empire was in its infancy.\n\nOn the other hand, early caliphate (such as that of Umar) banned the practice entirely while all of them disallowed any practice in Mecca. Qur'an 9:5 and Qur'an 9:28 expelled all polytheists from Mecca for being \"unclean\" so yeah.",

What's the point of mocking their Gods if it's about waste?\nI used an example, many more exist and I'll provide more if you want .\n\nAnother example is that after the conquest of Mecca, Muhammad sent expeditions to destroy remnants of pagan worship. A very well documented one in the Sirah is when he sent Khalid Ibn Al Walid to destroy idols of Al Uzza and its associated temples.\n\n\nI'm not judging Islam based on the actions of past prophets, I'm just showing the general attitude about what happens to polytheists when they're either under Islamic ruling or in the case of Abraham, when the Muslim is under Allah's protection and can do whatever they want without repercussions.\n\nAbraham being his own man is fine by me but why did God approve?\n\nLike we can make the same argument about burning the Qur'an, it's the same exact thing.\n\n2. \n>kaaba is not originally place to worship multiple pagan gods\n\nAny proof to that?\nThere's nothing historically that says that, all you have is a religious claim, I have yet to see evidence.\n\nIf all you have is religious claims then there's no argument here.\n\n>that led to the destruction of the idols around mecca and kaaba,also the rule said do not destroys place of worship and idols are just statue \n\nOh so you're saying that due to a violation of the treaty (which I agree happened), they went into war and conquered Mecca which lead to the destruction of idols? \nIdols aren't just statues as well, they're also parts of shrines. \nIf someone places idols in a public area and people worship their Gods in that area then this area becomes a shrine to said God.\nDestroying the idol in that area becomes the destruction of that shrine.\n\nSo what you're arguing basically refutes the image as well and you're just making my argument for me.\n\n3. The first is Hasan, the second is Sahih from one of the two most authentic sources for Hadith in Sunni Islam so I'm not sure what you're arguing for if you don't know that.\n\n>don't have beef with the jews its been said he has many time been kind to them and treat them fairly\n\nFair like how he massacred the Jewish tribe of Bani Qurayza for being neutral in a conflict against Muslims despite an alliance? Do you need a reminder that he simply took every boy who's gone through puberty by checking for pubic hair and every man then killed them and following that enslaved women and children (including some into sex slavery)? \nOr a reminder of the examples of tribes that were expulsed from their lands?\n\n4.\n\n>After the war the victor can enforce laws that they see fit granted they use the power justly , if they want a group of people out thay need to provide with the necessary stuff for survival like a place to go, accommodation, money and stuff, but usually in islam its been ordered to just taxed theme high\n\nJustly is doing the heavy lifting, I'll just link to a comment refuting how they were being treating justly since I addressed that in a different comment.\n\nJizya only applied to Christians and Jews (and eventually Zoroastrian after Umar in some instances) who accepted being limited in their freedom of religion. Anyone else was either killed or forcefully converted or had to live in hiding about their faith.\n\nHere's the comment of mine I mentioned:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/s/zTiahqKaJM\n\nIf you're going to claim I'm ignorant, at least come with verses and hadith to refute me.",

Context Matters in Quranic Verses\n\nYou mention Qur\u2019an 22:40, which states:\n\u201cFor had it not been for Allah\u2019s repelling some people by means of others, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, in which the name of Allah is often mentioned, would have been demolished.\u201d\n\nYour claim that it only protects Abrahamic places of worship is misleading. The verse highlights places where people worship God, but Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) generally extended this protection to any non-hostile religious sites\u2014including Hindu, Buddhist, and Zoroastrian temples in later Islamic rule. History shows that many non-Abrahamic temples were not destroyed, even under strict rulers like the Ottomans or the Mughals.\n\n2. The Story of Abraham and Idol-Breaking (Qur\u2019an 21:57-63)\n\nYes, Abraham broke idols to make a theological point about monotheism. However:\n\n* This was an isolated act, not an Islamic command for all Muslims to destroy idols.\n\n* The Qur\u2019an does not command followers to repeat this event.\n\n* The same Qur\u2019an that narrates this story also commands Muslims to respect other faiths and avoid compulsion in religion (Qur\u2019an 2:256).\n\n3. Did Muhammad Destroy Idols? (Sahih Bukhari 3020, 2478)\n\nYes, the Prophet Muhammad removed idols from the Kaaba, but the Kaaba was already meant to be a monotheistic site\u2014it had been built by Abraham for the worship of one God before idolatry was introduced. Removing them was an act of restoring its original purpose, not a general rule to destroy idols everywhere.\n\n4. Expelling Jews from Arabia (Sunan Abu Dawood 3025, Sahih Muslim 2284)\n\n* The order for Jews to leave was political, not religious\u2014many Jewish tribes in Medina had sided with enemies of the early Muslim state, violating treaties (such as the Banu Qurayza incident).\n\n* Jews and Christians were not expelled from all Islamic lands\u2014in fact, they thrived under Muslim rule in Andalusia, the Ottoman Empire, and Persia for centuries.\n\n* The hadith about Muhammad wanting Arabia to be for Muslims does not mean he commanded global expulsion of Jews\u2014it applied to specific regions under specific circumstances.\n\n5. The Context of Qur\u2019an 9:5 and 9:28\n\n* Qur\u2019an 9:5 (\u201cthe verse of the sword\u201d) was revealed in the context of war with the Quraysh tribe, who had broken treaties and launched attacks. It does not apply to all non-Muslims indefinitely\u2014this is a common misunderstanding.\n\n* Qur\u2019an 9:28 refers specifically to polytheists entering Mecca, not a blanket ban on all non-Muslims. Even today, many religious cities (e.g., Vatican City, certain Hindu temples) have restricted entry based on religious significance.\n\n6. The Early Caliphates & Religious Freedom\n\n* The Caliphate of Umar did restrict idol worship in Mecca, but he did not enforce a global destruction of all non-Muslim places of worship.\n\n* Hindu, Zoroastrian, and Buddhist places of worship survived under Islamic rule in Persia, India, and Central Asia.\n\n* Islamic dhimmi laws allowed non-Muslims to practice their faith freely, as long as they did not provoke hostilities against the Muslim state.\n\n\nConclusion? \n\nCherry-Picked Arguments Do Not Represent Islam\u2019s Full Picture.\n\nYour argument, like that of many Islamic fundamentalists and Islamophobes alike, picks isolated incidents while ignoring broader historical and legal traditions in Islam.\n\nIslamic history proves that Islam did not enforce total destruction of non-Muslim religions\u2014and to suggest otherwise is misleading. Instead of focusing on selective hadiths and Quranic verses taken out of context, it\u2019s essential to look at the legal rulings, historical applications, and scholarly consensus that have governed Islamic societies for over 1400 years.",

The Rashidun caliphates (headed by the Sahaba) destroyed many Zoroastrian temples and worship sites or turned them into mosques. It's very well documented but I can always provide sources if needed.",

So they clearly were in a position of submission to their islamic rulers.\n\nQur'an 5:51 forbids political alliances with Christians and Jews meaning that they had no political representation and couldn't politically associate with Muslims and therefore advocate for themselves.\n\nQur'an 3:110-112 calls Jews and Christians as humiliated and impoverished under islamic rule and that their poverty is decreed upon them from Allah himself. \n\nSahih Muslim 1767 shows Muhammad's intention to expell all Jews and Christians from the Arabian peninsula.\n\nSahihh Bukhari 3947 shows Muhammad disrespecting Jews fasting during Ashura \"We have more rights to fast on this day than them\" and appropriating that practice which shows how Muhammad sees them as inferior.\n\nSocially speaking they were also marginalized, Muhammad mandated then they should be greeted using the Salam greeeing (which is peaceful in nature and not necessarily exclusive to Muslims) and to force them into the narrowest part of the road in Sahih Bukhari 2338 which shows how Muhammad considers interactions with Jews should be approached.\n\nThose are only examples so what are yours to show that they prospered?\n\n>If an apostate wants to live in an Islamic theocracy, that\u2019s on them.

Islam itself is not its root word, it means surrender, submission.\n\nSalam means peace, not Islam. \u201cReligion of Peace\u201d would be \u201cDeen us-Salam\u201d. \n\nThose scholars arguably twist the meaning around, but aren\u2019t wrong. You people attacking them over it, because whoop-di-doo - Muslims fought in wars like everyone else, is beating a dead horse. Their point is that Muslims are commanded to obey the law wherever they are, and that even in state sanctioned war, there are rules of engagement and no forced conversions, contrary to what you nut jobs believe. When it comes down to it, Muslims have been far more civilized in war than any of you. Saladin washed the streets with rose water when the Crusaders flooded them with blood, because we have clear limit on warfare.\n\nTo call me a terrorist like ISIS on the basis of linguistics - holy crap. You get called out on your subpar intellect and decide to start labeling people as in the same boat as ISIS? Yikes.\n\nMaking fetish jokes while arguing a point is stupid, and reveals you to be extremely stupid.

What about Qur'an 46:15 mentioning the age of wisdom being 40 and counting in months and years? What's the reference point there?\n\nIslamic sources mention Muhammad becoming a prophet at 40 years old (Sahih Bukhari 3851), according to what is that tracked? What about Usama ibn Zayd becoming a commander at 17? (Sahih Bukhari 3730)\n\nIt was the norm for age to be tracked in all neighboring empires, can you provide evidence that age wasn't tracked?   \nEven the biography of the Muhammad by Ibn Ishaq's contains genealogies across centuries.\n\n\\>People 15 years from now may well be calling you a pedophile for knowing that brain development continues past 18.

As a society we were ignorant and now we know better. The people of the past who accepted child marriage were pedophiles but they were products of their time and not an example to follow in that regard unlike Muhammad.\n\nIf in the future, due to new discoveries leading to attraction to people less than 25yo as wrong then we'll also be products of our time that didn't know any better. It's that simple.  \nIf Muhammad was considered a product for his time and that his marriage to Aisha didn't implicitly make it halal to marry a child then there would be no issue here.\n\n\\>does marrying them make you a pedophile, or your society pedophilic for sanctioning it?\n\nBoth? That's a false dichotomy. It wasn't even the norm to marry prepubescent children back then and especially to consummate that marriage at 9 years old even back then. \n\n\\>it doesn\u2019t give blanket permission across time to marry them  \nFirstly, the Qur'an says otherwise actually. \n\n\\>The law was in place because that was the best tool available.

Jesus Christ is another prophet in Islam, just not considered to be the Son of God. They actually like him and think he was a cool guy. Judaism is much the same, and shares some prophets with Islam as well. \n\nWhere you have problems, as you do in any religion, is when fundamentalist groups gain power. Imagine the Westboro Baptist Church, the one that protested soldiers funerals and had all the offensive signs blaming gay people for natural disasters, grew very large and spread their message successfully to people living in horrible conditions, who believed their message of hate. That's still a bad thing. \n\nI won't get into geo-politics or religion debate in here, but suffice it to say, many fundamentalists groups, probably several you've heard of have been funded and weaponized in proxy-wars by various hegemonic powers against other local groups or governments, to varying degrees of success. \n\nRemember that any religious militancy is always a reactionary force against something. You do not grow to hate others and disobey the tenets of your own religion without outside pressure, like say, decades of oppression and struggle.",

And that is the one whose menstruation has stopped due to her older age. Her Iddah is three months instead of the three monthly cycles for those who menstruate, which is based upon the Ayah in (Surat) Al-Baqarah. see 2:228 The same for the young, who have not reached the years of menstruation. Their `Iddah is three months like those in menopause. This is the meaning of His saying; (and for those who have no courses...)\n\nAsbab Al-Nuzul by Al-Wahidi\n\nAnd for such of your women as despair of menstruation\u2026) [65:4]. Said Muqatil: \u201cWhen the verse (Women who are divorced shall wait, keeping themselves apart\u2026), Kallad ibn al-Nu\u2018man ibn Qays al-Ansari said: \u2018O Messenger of Allah, what is the waiting period of the woman who does not menstruate and the woman who has not menstruated yet? And what is the waiting period of the pregnant woman?\u2019 And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\u201d. Abu Ishaq al-Muqri\u2019 informed us> Muhammad ibn \u2018Abd Allah ibn Hamdun> Makki ibn \u2018Abdan> Abu\u2019l-Azhar> Asbat ibn Muhammad> Mutarrif> Abu \u2018Uthman \u2018Amr ibn Salim who said: \u201cWhen the waiting period for divorced and widowed women was mentioned in Surah al-Baqarah, Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b said; \u2018O Messenger of Allah, some women of Medina are saying: there are other women who have not been mentioned!\u2019 He asked him: \u2018And who are they?\u2019 He said: \u2018Those who are too young [such that they have not started menstruating yet], those who are too old [whose menstruation has stopped] and those who are pregnant\u2019. And so this verse (And for such of your women as despair of menstruation\u2026) was revealed\u201d.\n\nIbn Hanbal is claimed to have set nine as the age at which a bride cannot be kept from her husband. Others like Abu Hanifa said maintenance waits until maturity (hatta tablugh). Shafi'i used phrases like her being able to tolerate (mithluh\u0101) intercourse or Abu Hanifa that she had come of age and could tolerate intercourse with a man (tudrik wa tu\u1e6d\u012bq al-rij\u0101l). Prepubescent consummation was explicitly discussed by Shafi'i, and implicitly by Ibn Hanbal given he (according to Ibn Qudama) specified nine.\n\nAbu Hanifa - page 97\n\nMalik - 116-7\n\nShafi'i (and Ibn al Mundhir) - 134, 179\n\nIbn Hanbal (and Ibn Qudama) - page 139 footnote 65, pages 212-4, 7, 10, 12, 17, 20\n\nThis is all based on the historic scholarship indicating that Muhammad consummated marriage with a 9 year old girl. Do you think 9 years old is an acceptable age to marry? Here are some hadith references (all Sahih, authentic) which indicate Aisha was a small girl, playing with dolls and swings:\n\nhttps://sunnah.com/abudawud:4935\n\nhttps://sunnah.com/abudawud:4933\n\nhttps://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130\n\nFrom the last hadith:\n\n(The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for `Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.)",

Some will have some logic and reasoning skills and will be skeptical (for good reason, since the story and the threat of punishment have no basis in reality and quite clearly a fabrication). So despite it not being a real thing, it takes a truly immoral person to even mention something as toxic as an idea that results in unimaginable suffering just for knowing it.\n\nSimilarly since babies and children go to Jannah when they die, the only moral action you can take is to kill them while they are children. Particularly before they can speak or understand religious concepts. If you end their lives early, they get to go to Jannah free of charge with zero risk, but if you let them live to adulthood they might hear this idea and out of those some will use the reasoning abilities to determine that there isn\u2019t any evidence that this story is more than a fantasy being used to manipulate them. The ones that are lucky enough to be created stupid and unable to discriminate fantasy from reality will be rewarded with Jannah, but the unlucky ones that Allah chose to create with skepticism and intellect will be compelled to use those abilities to discern a hoax. Then Allah will\nhave no choice but to send them to\njahannam since he created them with minds that are predisposed to not believe in him. Which makes complete and total sense when you see that Allahu alim and even if we can\u2019t understand why Allah does things this way, it doesn\u2019t matter. Everything he wishes to happen is right and good, even if our tiny brains can\u2019t see the grand wisdom in what could appear to us as a contradiction.",

If you truly love your child then the only moral thing to ensure they are not punished is to kill them before they have a chance to hear about the concept of Islam.\n\nAny good parent should be willing to sacrifice their soul for the eternal happiness of their child. I would. I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle finding out that I cursed my child to jahannam by letting them hit the age/understanding needed to be punished for not accepting this idea of Islam. If we can make sure they\u2019re not alive by then, we can ensure that there is absolutely zero chance that they will be punished by Allah. I completely understand it is haram, but I also understand that Allah created children in a way that he gives us a loophole where we can not leave it up to chance. We know in every population there are people that are capable of critical thinking, as well as some that were created to be gullible or unintelligent. We can\u2019t know for sure until they start growing up, but by then it\u2019s too late. If they get accidental exposure to the idea of Islam, we know how incredibly strict Allah is with this. remember, Allahu Alim. He knows best. So since we cannot know, and for those who love their children and want to guarantee there is no chance that they are punished, killing them before the trial period ends is the best thing you can do for their health. Well, not physical health, that is only for the dunya. I\u2019m talking spiritual health. I think if you asked most people they would be ok with doing a haram thing even if it ment perpetual torture, so long as their child is blissfully in Jannah. I just can\u2019t see how anyone would hesitate on that. How could you live with yourself knowing you had an opportunity to give your child eternal happiness and Bliss with Allah by killing them before they could potentially choose the wrong choice by accidentally using the reasoning abilities Allah gave them specifically for them to use in determining is Islam is more likely than not a man made mythology than any kind of objective proof? Remember, Allah created this child to think critically. He places them in a world where all the scientific evidence and study of human history and anthropology indicates that Mesopotamian death gave way to many of the monotheisms and including Judaism Christianity and Islam, and that through all of these there isn\u2019t any logical basis to suspend disbelief for an ideology that, as it appears to any rationally discerning individual, is clearly morally bankrupt and not worth investing the time to even try to pretend that it the true way. His plan for this child is torture, since he specifically created him to correctly assess the evidence in front of him and determine (even though it\u2019s not true and Allah is very real) that no sane person would believe this garbage. but\nThis is where Allah in all his wisdom subhan Allah has given us free will and we can save this child for the terrible punishments that Allah planned for him when he made the child have a functional brain. Allah needs us to use that free will to end the child\u2019s life before it becomes possible to use the reasoning abilities he gave that child specifically to misdirect the child and send him to\njahannam. It can sound complicated but in the end the child will be spared of the torture. We will\nBe punished because as you said it is haram, but it will be worth every excruciating second knowing that our precious child and his soul will be spared by our sacrifice. There\u2019s nothing more noble than that. Perhaps Allah will be impressed by that, or Perhaps he will be wrathful and angry that we are the way we are despite him making us that way.\nWe can never know. But Allahu Alim akhi",

Contemporary Islam might leave one in a worse situation than other contemporary ideologies, but it's still better than pre-Islamic Middle Eastern cultures.\n\nBefore Islam, Middle Eastern women had no rights at all, and female infanticide was more common than in Eastern Asia in the same time period. Islam ended female infanticide because it enforces a culture of strictness. Today, Muslim Middle Easterners almost never practice sex selective abortion, something practiced often in South Asia and East Asia where there is a Hindu or Buddhist plurality.\n\nIslam gave Middle Eastern women limited rights, which is still better than zero rights. Women in the contemporary Middle East can inherit half as much as their brother. Their testimony in court is worth half as much as that of a man - a stark improvement over pre-Islamic Middle Eastern cultures.\n\nIslam does allow adults to nonce kids, but it also sets an age limit for it (Aisha's age at the time). Before Islam there was no age limit.\n\nIslam sets an upper limit for the number of women a man is allowed to marry. Without Islam, a town's hottest, richest, and most charismatic man could theoretically marry all of the women, and then hundreds or thousands of other men couldn't marry any woman.\n\nMost Middle Easterners don't want to be progressive Western Atheists.

Islam persevered (in Medina as refugees), and flourished once a Muslim united the cities of Mecca and Medina. The peace that followed in the Arabian peninsula was only possible due to the war that ended the persecution.\n\nOf course Christianity had a more bloodless expansion as a tiny cult to state religion as they already enjoyed the conditions of peace once they controlled the largest Mediterranean empire to this day. Persecution requires a relative monopoly on violence.\n\nHence you need war to establish arms supremacy in order to enjoy peace under the hegemon.

You might believe it necessary even, to believe in military action against an aggressor in order to achieve a real and fruitful peace.\n\nThe alternative is submission to the aggressor, and Islam directly translates to submission. The caveat is that Islam teaches submission to Allah primarily, and then to the state, and then to the community. The very premise of Islamic philosophy presupposes a state that possesses a military in order to establish itself, because all states require a military in order to establish themselves. This concept is called the monopoly on violence and is the theory that a state\u2019s authority is derived from its monopoly over violence in a jurisdiction that defines its extent.",

No offense but it's a common theme among anyone that criticizes Islam or Muhammad, and it makes me just question how truthful the rest of the talking points are really going to be.\n\nHere is the main philosophy in Islam though, which is very thoughtful and wise: war is sadly an inevitable part of humans and their history, and the world will experience war whether we like it or not. Islam has rules on how to fight a war bot because Islam prefers or likes war, but in case a war happens and must be dealt with - the good ol' saying goes \"a peaceful man doesn't like war, but he is always ready for it\".\n\nAs for terrorist statistics- the thing I hate about the word terrorism is how much of a propaganda term it is. It's used to describe muslim groups like Hamas, but for some reason it's not used for IDF and American forces, who have broken rules of war as well. There were anti-muslim mass shooters, and the media doesn't call \"terrorists\", but \"mentally ill gunman\". I think it's a stupid word to use in order to prove anything, because it's just a propaganda term at this point.",

The news of this event, reached Ibn `Abbas who said, \"If I had been in his place, I would not have burnt them, as Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) forbade it, saying, 'Do not punish anybody with Allah's punishment (fire).' I would have killed them according to the statement of Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa), 'Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him.'\"\n\nSahih al-Bukhari 6922\nhttps://sunnah.com/bukhari:6922\n\nNarrated Abu Burda: Abu Musa said, \"I came to the Prophet (\ufdfa) along with two men (from the tribe) of Ash`ariyin, one on my right and the other on my left, while Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) was brushing his teeth (with a Siwak), and both men asked him for some employment. The Prophet (\ufdfa) said, 'O Abu Musa (O `Abdullah bin Qais!).' I said, 'By Him Who sent you with the Truth, these two men did not tell me what was in their hearts and I did not feel (realize) that they were seeking employment.' As if I were looking now at his Siwak being drawn to a corner under his lips, and he said, 'We never (or, we do not) appoint for our affairs anyone who seeks to be employed. But O Abu Musa! (or `Abdullah bin Qais!) Go to Yemen.'\" The Prophet then sent Mu`adh bin Jabal after him and when Mu`adh reached him, he spread out a cushion for him and requested him to get down (and sit on the cushion). Behold: There was a fettered man beside Abu Muisa. Mu`adh asked, \"Who is this (man)?\" Abu Muisa said, \"He was a Jew and became a Muslim and then reverted back to Judaism.\" Then Abu Muisa requested Mu`adh to sit down but Mu`adh said, \"I will not sit down till he has been killed. This is the judgment of Allah and His Apostle (for such cases) and repeated it thrice. Then Abu Musa ordered that the man be killed, and he was killed. Abu Musa added, \"Then we discussed the night prayers and one of us said, 'I pray and sleep, and I hope that Allah will reward me for my sleep as well as for my prayers.'\"\n\nSahih al-Bukhari 6923\nhttps://sunnah.com/bukhari:6923\n\nNarrated `Ali: Whenever I tell you a narration from Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa), by Allah, I would rather fall down from the sky than ascribe a false statement to him, but if I tell you something between me and you (not a Hadith) then it was indeed a trick (i.e., I may say things just to cheat my enemy). No doubt I heard Allah's Apostle saying, \"During the last days there will appear some young foolish people who will say the best words but their faith will not go beyond their throats (i.e. they will have no faith) and will go out from (leave) their religion as an arrow goes out of the game. So, where-ever you find them, kill them, for who-ever kills them shall have reward on the Day of Resurrection.\"\n\nSahih al-Bukhari 6930\nhttps://sunnah.com/bukhari:6930",

Mohammed never even told anyone to write any of his \"revelations\" down, which is questionable considering they were \"oh so important revelations\" by his alla, and he had to be reminded on multiple occasions what he was \"told by alla\" previously, man couldn't even remember his own words while he was alive. \n\nI mean seriously, they guy said surah 5:3 \"This day have I perfected your religion for you and completed My favour upon you and have chosen for you Islam as religion.\" he completed it by the 5th chapter, then why continue another 100 chapters? Unless he forgot what he said on chapter 5 lol",

Now to get to your point of the people getting arrested for being suspected, the thing is that all Muslim countries fall into the category of authoritarian regimes to different degrees so they do these things as a means of population control/oppression under a guise of keeping societal harmony or whatever sad excuse, but honestly there are so many things that you can't do or say that would get you disappeared/tortured/executed in those countries a lot of them not even related to religion, but that's a topic for another time.

This also doesn't address the fate of those who were simply born, raised with no alternative (indoctrination) into Islam. Just check the prosecution tracker and read some of the stories.\n\nLike in that regard, even if I agree that those who convert without knowing enough about the religion messed up, their punishment remains the same in a Shari'a compliant country.\n\n>if you harm your wife in anyway to even cause light bruising it is absolutely impermissible (What is \"allowed\" is often described as \"with a toothbrush\" or \"a folded handkerchief\" so nothing more than something you'd do in a playful manner).\n\nThat's not really true. It's one interpretation sure, but it doesn't have ijma' (consensus). If you want, I can bring up many sahih hadith where Muhammad himself condoned violent wife beating. The only actual restriction that has consensus is that a man has to avoid the face and avoid causing injuries (similar to how abusers avoid doing today to avoid getting caught). \n\nEven if we look at it logically, that interpretation falls apart, a man feels his wife is disobedient (or actually just fears her disobedience) so he advised her, stops sleeping with her both sexually and in the same bed, creates distance and when all else fails the next logical escalation step is hitting her symbolically with a toothbrush?

I don't see anything showing how it has to be a caliphate rather than simply a state ruled by someone who enforces Shari'a (the concept of Wali).\nI'm pretty sure that a country that enforces some Shari'a is Islamically considered better than one that doesn't because the idea becomes that it's \"striving\" to slowly enforce all of it.\n\n\n>The only country that HAD religious police was Saudi Arabia and that was abolished with the new regime. \n\nThat's not true, It actually still does have jt, it's influenced was weakened however.

Any evidence for that?\n\nAs of today, all 4 mazhabs agree that apostates of Islam get the death penalty. Where they disagree is whether they should be given a period of time to recant or not and they also differ on the length of the period.\nWhere's the nuance here?

When you start putting laws into place or follow scripture that mandate a punishment on someone for existing then you dehuminize them. That dehuminization is why they don't get those human rights you mention.",

In this\nrespect Islamic territory comprises all states where Muslims live even with non-Muslims\n(\u201cpeople of the treaty\u201d) if those regions were previously conquered (opened) by Muslims.\"\n\nAnd\n\n\n\"The modern interpretation of the Caliphate upheld by Sunni legal thought proceeds\nfrom the fact that Islamic power prioritizes the content of the activity not its form. Muslim legal\nscholars pay special attention to the fact that Sharia does not require the establishment of power\nnecessarily in the form of Caliphate. Fiqh does not view the Caliphate as the chief goal and does\nnot mention it among the religious cult precepts Allah rewards for.\"\n\nIn other words, it's sufficient for the majority to be Muslim for it to be legitimate for Shari'a related laws to be put into place.\n\n\n\n>As for your second point, you have to remember that hadith and Quran came to address human life in general across time but it came from a 7th century lens, now think back to that time what was the norm in treating your wife? basically property, men were extremely oppressive and abusive towards women to an unimaginable extent, so Islam came down to regulate all that clean it up and give women back their rights, so it's not about women being like dogs but it's about the men at that time being very casual with severe domestic abuse that it needed to be spelled out for them to understand not to do that, and it is sad that it was required in the first place.\n\nMy rebuttal is that the Qur'an according to Islam is written for all people regardless of the time period. It was simply revealed to Muhammad to be shared rather than written to suit Muhammad's people.\n\nUnless you're saying that Qur'an 34:28, 2:185, 21:107 speaking of Muhammad and the Qur'an to be for all people, mankind and all the worlds is wrong.\n\nThe second issue with that argument is that it picks arbitrarily what's only applicable back then and what's applicable now so it becomes arbitrary to interpret what was only \"back then\" and what's applicable for now. By that same approach, it becomes justifiable for a Muslim to do whatever they want as long as they follow the 5 Pillars since everything from premarital sex, alcohol, eating pork, adoption and so on can be justified today when contextualising those prohibitions to a 7th century lens.\n\n\nThirdly, for the apostacy, reread this section of the article you cited: The Punishment for Apostasy in the Islamic Juristic Tradition\n\nIt first goes to acknowledge that throughout history since Muhammad, apostacy in Islam was punished by death. It goes on to say that there's an opportunity given to recant which I agree is a thing but doesn't detract from the point I'm making, it condemns vigilantism and says only the Wali or the justice system can dispense the death penalty rather than individual Muslims which I don't disagree with.\n\nIt goes on to say how it's outward apostacy that is punished rather than what's \"in your heart\" which I mean of course?\n\nAll in all, it makes the argument that the killing of apostates is used to control public order. If people who leave Islam can never speak out about it then it avoids people being uncomfortable and acknowledging that people can leave Islam for valid reasons.\nIt argues that because of westernisation, religion isn't that important to public order anymore \" and makes a dubious interpretation like \n\n\"When the Prophet \ufdfa says that a Muslim cannot be killed except as punishment for murder, adultery or leaving Islam, he qualifies the apostate here as one who \u201cleaves his religion and forsakes the community (al-t\u0101rik li-d\u012bnihi al-muf\u0101riq li\u2019l-jam\u0101\u02bfa).\u201d\n46\n Or, in another version, one who \u201cmakes war on God and His Messenger.\u201d''\n\nWhich I think is a pretty bad argument because someone who leaves Islam leaves the Muslim community without waging war on them?\n\nLook, reread it without bias, it acknowledged everything I said, it makes a case for it to no longer be the case because public order and minority interpretations of certain hadith. I understand the Yaqueen institute's aims and it's good to reform Islam. \nThe act of accepting minority opinions on certain matters of Sunni Islam can't be taken as fact because despite those opinions existing, they don't hold to scrutiny in the Sunni Muslim community which makes them not \"ijma'\" which is essential for an interpretation to be valid and doesn't hold to consistency.\n\nI'm happy you managed to find an interpretation that works for you but I'm sad to tell you that this interpretation remains the minority, has nothing to do with Sunnism as of now and isn't what is and was believed or practiced by Muhammad, The Sahaba and most Muslims (which the article acknowledges).\n\n>I don't see any transparency or justice in them.\n\nJustice according to what? You or fundamentalist Islam?\n\n>I promise you Islam did not come to dehumanize anyone no matter how sinful, it really is the people and their ignorance/ego, tribalism, us vs them\n\nThen tell me this, did Muhammad and the Sahaba practice and preach the things I've said?\nDid he dehuminize polytheists? Kill apostates, arbitrarily kill those who criticised him? Instituted an us Vs them for Muslims and polytheists? Include all of the above into the Qur'an and the Hadith that must be followed without question in full submission?\n\nHow do you make this work with these verses?\n**Obeying the Prophet is the same as Obeying Allah**\n\n\"Whoever obeys the Messenger has indeed obeyed Allah; but those who turn away - We have not sent you over them as a guardian.\" (Qur'an, 4:80)\n\n**The Prophet is there to clarify the Qur'an and provides context**\n\n\"And We have not sent down upon you the Book (the Qur'an) except for you to clarify to them that in which they have differed and as guidance and mercy for a people who believe.\" (Qur'an, 16:64)\n\n**If you don't accept Muhammad's Justice and accept his decisions in submission, you have no faith**\n\n\"But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.\" (Qur'an, 4:65)\n\nI mean honestly the version of islam you're arguing for isn't acknowledged by most scholars, doesn't stand to scrutiny without contradicting the religion, was never followed by Muhammad or the sahaba, was never followed by all the caliphates and was never applied by a Muslim country up until Muslim countries lost their positions of strength. Even slavery remained in Saudi Arabia until western influence helped a abolish it in the 60s.",

                                            "body": "> In other words, it's sufficient for the majority to be Muslim for it to be legitimate for Shari'a related laws to be put into place.\n\nI specifically mentioned that a \"caliphate\" can be established without it being named a caliphate but there are requisite conditions for it to be valid, a country can be Islamic but not follow Shariah, part of a Shariah compliant ruling system is voting for example, and the caliph or equivalent needs to be democratically elected which is completely missing from all Muslim countries as they have severely corrupt governments which most are unelected.\n\nAs for apostacy I feel like we are trying to argue different things, I am talking about the situation where a person no longer wants to be a Muslim, the other scenario where you're actively fighting against Islam during a time where legitimate Islamic rule exists then it makes sense that a punishment like that can executed in a time of war, I just want to pushback against the popular idea of leaving Islam will immediately get you killed it's always more nuanced than that.\n\nI still believe that the article gives nuance without pretending that the punishment isn't there, and for me it does highlight the fact that in our day and age if a Muslim wanted to convert to another religion or just leave religion as a whole then that cannot in any practical way incur the Shariah mandated punishment by anyone especially with my previous point regarding establishing a Shariah compliant ruling system, which literally does not exist because every Muslim country picks and chooses their legislation + no way for Muslims to truly vote and be represented. If the foundation of an Islamic ruling system, (i.e. no democratically elected Muslim leader and no elected judges) then you can't claim that anyone can apply shariah rule. \n\n> The second issue with that argument is that it picks arbitrarily what's only applicable back then and what's applicable now so it becomes arbitrary to interpret what was only \"back then\" and what's applicable for now. By that same approach, it becomes justifiable for a Muslim to do whatever they want as long as they follow the 5 Pillars since everything from premarital sex, alcohol, eating pork, adoption and so on can be justified today when contextualizing those prohibitions to a 7th century lens.\n\nAs for how to pick what is ordered for all time vs current time this is not arbitrary not up to the individual and they need to defer to scholars and it is their job to ensure that they are keeping people updated in regards of how when and why.\n\n> I understand the Yaqueen institute's aims and it's good to reform Islam.\n\nThe Yaqeen Institute in no way seeks to reform anything about Islam if anything they explicitly say they want to revive the essence of Orthodoxy, so this is not some new version of Islam, the sources they use are deeply rooted within the Sunnah and Quran. Just because a lot of Muslims are ignorant of Islam that does not detract from the truth, it is right there for those who seek it, once again the Muslim world is in shambles nothing but a hollow shell.\n\nYou said it yourself that if a Muslim leaves Islam without waging war then there is no basis for any kind of killing, and you've highlighted the fact that they are not actually causing any disorder, I am not sure why that answer is not enough, I don't want to argue that Islam is pacifist and is all rainbows and sunshine, it is a system which governs your life and death, but it is not about killing anyone who just leaves like it is characterized elsewhere.\n\n> Then tell me this, did Muhammad and the Sahaba practice and preach the things I've said? Did he dehuminize polytheists? Kill apostates, arbitrarily kill those who criticised him? Instituted an us Vs them for Muslims and polytheists? Include all of the above into the Qur'an and the Hadith that must be followed without question in full submission?\n\nThe Prophet and the Sahaba dehumanized their enemies that waged war on them, and they did distance themselves from polytheists but they still had a place in their society, they had rights and protections under Muslim rule however people of the book had more rights and Muslims even more so, but still no polytheist genocides, if they fought against the Muslims obviously they would kill them but otherwise their humanity and human rights were protected.\n\n> arbitrarily kill those who criticised him?\n\nFrom my knowledge the prophet has never ordered someone killed due to them criticizing him unless they also were guilty of other matters that would warrant death, such as conspiring against Muslims for example.\n\n> Obeying the Prophet is the same as Obeying Allah\n\nYes obeying the prophet leads you towards the path of Allah therefore obeying the prophet is obeying Allah especially since we have explicit orders from Allah to obey the prophet.\n\n> \"Whoever obeys the Messenger has indeed obeyed Allah; but those who turn away - We have not sent you over them as a guardian.\" (Qur'an, 4:80)\n\nThis proves the point of the original post as well, where you are not responsible (being the guardian of) to convert everyone but you deliver the message and the rest is up to the person themselves.\n\n> The Prophet is there to clarify the Qur'an and provides context\n\nYes the prophet was sent to provide deeper understanding and be a living example of how to follow the teachings of Allah.\n\n> If you don't accept Muhammad's Justice and accept his decisions in submission, you have no faith\n\nYes, part of obeying the prophet is accepting his justice and decisions and if you disobey the prophet you're disobeying Allah when he commanded the Muslims to follow his prophet.\n\nEdit: You can think of apostesy and treason as closely related for the Muslims of that time, but there is still a clear line between both.",

If no, then then the current state of corruption in Muslim countries is irrelevant.\n\n>I am talking about the situation where a person no longer wants to be a Muslim, the other scenario where you're actively fighting against Islam during a time where legitimate Islamic rule exists then it makes sense that a punishment like that can executed in a time of war, I just want to pushback against the popular idea of leaving Islam will immediately get you killed it's always more nuanced than that.\n\nActually no, I'm arguing against the article you linked earlier, like I said read it to its completion. In the situation where a person no longer wants to be a Muslim, if they outwardly show that they're not a Muslim or speak of the fact that they are no longer are a Muslim, that makes them eligible for the Hadd of apostacy which is the death penalty.\nTo a consensus of scholars it also constitutes as a disruption of public order which Islamically constitutes an act of war against the community but that's secondary and I merely mentioned that to highlight the flaw in the article you sent.\n\n>it does highlight the fact that in our day and age if a Muslim wanted to convert to another religion or just leave religion as a whole then that cannot in any practical way incur the Shariah mandated punishment by anyone\n\nYes it makes that claim, I don't think it makes a good case. Can you in your own words explain how does that Islamically make sense in light of the things I've said before about the necessity to submit to islamic rulings?\n\nIslam never claimed that all it's rulings are practical. Inheritance laws today aren't practical in light of feminism allowing women to work but I don't see someone arguing for their removal. So I don't think it's valid to dismiss the punishment of apostacy for practical reasons.\n\n>establishing a Shariah compliant ruling system, which literally does not exist because every Muslim country picks and chooses their legislation + no way for Muslims to truly vote and be represented.\n\nThat's not exactly relevant. The study you linked doesn't speak for democracy as far as I understand but do quote the study if it mentions that. It says that a country that is majority Muslim that previously was conquered by the caliphate and whose ruler is Muslim is legitimate in applying any aspect of Shari'a they wish to apply.\nRegardless, if a democratically elected president goes all in on Shari'a and applies the death penalty, does it now become okay?\n\n\n>As for how to pick what is ordered for all time vs current time this is not arbitrary not up to the individual and they need to defer to scholars and it is their job to ensure that they are keeping people updated in regards of how when and why.\n\nGreat, so since the majority of scholars of all 4 schools of jurisprudence agree that the apostacy law is applicable to any Muslim who is caught leaving Islam and that the only recourse they have is recanting it within X days (based on the Mazhab) then there's no issue for apostacy anymore, is that it?\n\n\n\n>You said it yourself that if a Muslim leaves Islam without waging war\n\nNuance here is that leaving Islam is an act of war if we're being orthodox about it.\nClassical scholars agree on that, the hadith about killing a Muslim if they wage war against the community also includes a wording with \"if they leave the community\" and by definition when you leave Islam, you also leave the Muslim community because you no longer practice with them. It's not that complicated to follow logically speaking.\n\nIt isn't even relevant when you look at the big picture because it's not required to wage war against Allah or Muhammad to have the penalty applied. History shows this, Muhammad showed this (The war of apostacy happened after Muhammad died therefore the Hadith about killing apostates predate that being an act of war).\n\nSo you're obfuscating a bit by adding irrelevant points I feel.\nSo can you stick to explaining the legitimacy of apostacy as a punishment Islamically generally?\nIt's a simple question:\n\nIf a Muslim by birth or conversion leaves Islam for any reason, stop practicing it and is public and open about not being a Muslim anymore, does Islam mandate the death penalty for that person where Shari'a is applicable?\n\n>This proves the point of the original post as well, where you are not responsible (being the guardian of) to convert everyone but you deliver the message and the rest is up to the person themselves.\n\nSo Shari'a isn't a thing that is applied by a ruler anymore in a Muslim country?\nWhat's the point for hudud then?\n\n>Yes, part of obeying the prophet is accepting his justice and decisions and if you disobey the prophet you're disobeying Allah when he commanded the Muslims to follow his prophet.\n\nThe command to follow Muhammad applies to this day, so should a Muslim ruler who is legitimate in applying Shari'a obey Muhammad in executing apostates for their crime against Allah of leaving Islam?\nVigilantism isn't what I'm talking about. Obeying the prophet also applies to rulers and Muslim rulers are mandated by Allah and Muhammad to apply Shari'a on their Muslim subjects/people.\n\n\n>From my knowledge the prophet has never ordered someone killed due to them criticizing him\n\nI forgot but here's a few Hadiths:\n\nSahih Bukhari 4037-4038 about Ka'ab inn Al-Ashraf who mocked the prophet and Islam. The hadith is about the order Muhammad gave to assassinate him.\n\nSahih bukhari 4039 is about Muhammad ordering the assassination of the Jewish poet Abu Rafi' who made mocking poetry about him.\n\nThere's also a Hasan Hadith where Muhammad forgives the man who killed his slave after he told Muhammad that the reason he killed his slave was because that slave insulted Muhammad. (Sunan Abu Dawud 4361).\n\nMany apologetics will replace \"mock\" with \"abuse\" or \"harm\" but in all cases, theh will mean \"verbally\". It's a translation to obfuscate what happened and linguistic lexicons that cone from islamic sources refute that translation.",

Prime example of why one should also follow the commentary and footnotes of Tafsir by Islamic Scholars.\nCommentary clarifies that the verse puts both the things face to face and in contrast\nSo based upon the culture of Arabia, wine was widespread and a common beverage in the society. Makes sense to gradually phase it out over a period of time rather than abolishing it in one verse (and Allah SWT knows best because he is all-knowing and aware of everything).\nSo the first Verse of the Quran which quotes alcohol is (16:67) and faces the intoxication (tippling) with the good provision.

                            "body": "The question of Aisha\u2019s age at the time of her marriage to the Prophet Muhammad is a topic of debate among historians and Islamic scholars. While traditional Islamic sources often state that Aisha was around nine years old when the marriage was consummated, some modern scholars and researchers have questioned this narrative and provided evidence suggesting she may have been older. Below are some of the key points and evidence used to argue that Aisha was older than nine:\n\n\u2014\n\n1. Historical Context and Contradictions in Early Sources\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Some early Islamic sources contain inconsistencies regarding Aisha\u2019s age. For example:\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Ibn Hisham\u2019s biography of Muhammad does not explicitly mention Aisha\u2019s age at marriage, leaving room for interpretation.\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u2060Other historical accounts, such as those from Tabari, suggest Aisha may have been older based on the timeline of events.\n\n\u2014\n\n2. Age of Aisha\u2019s Sister, Asma\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Aisha\u2019s sister, Asma bint Abi Bakr, is a key figure in this debate. Historical records indicate that Asma was 10 years older than Aisha.\n\u2022\t\u2060Asma died in 73 AH (692-693 CE) at the age of 100, meaning she was born around 595 CE.\n\u2022\t\u2060If Asma was born in 595 CE and was 10 years older than Aisha, Aisha would have been born around 605 CE.\n\u2022\t\u2060This would make Aisha approximately 18-19 years old at the time of her marriage to Muhammad in 623-624 CE.\n\n\u2014\n\n3. Aisha\u2019s Participation in the Battle of Badr and Uhud\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Aisha is reported to have accompanied Muhammad to the Battle of Badr (624 CE) and the Battle of Uhud (625 CE).\n\u2022\t\u2060If Aisha were only nine years old at the time of her marriage, she would have been around 10-11 during these battles, which seems unlikely given the physical and logistical demands of participating in such events.\n\u2022\t\u2060Her active role in these battles suggests she was older and more mature.\n\n\u2014\n\n4. Aisha\u2019s Pre-Islamic Betrothal\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Some sources suggest that Aisha was previously betrothed to another man, Jubayr ibn Mut\u2019im, before her marriage to Muhammad.\n\u2022\t\u2060If this is true, it would imply that Aisha was of marriageable age before her union with Muhammad, which would likely place her in her mid-to-late teens.\n\n\u2014\n\n5. Cultural and Historical Norms\n\n\u2022\t\u2060In pre-Islamic Arabia, it was uncommon for girls as young as nine to be married. Marriage typically occurred after puberty, which was often in the mid-to-late teens.\n\u2022\t\u2060The idea of Aisha being nine years old may have been influenced by later cultural norms or misinterpretations of early sources.\n\n\u2014\n\n6. Alternative Interpretations of Hadith\n\n\u2022\t\u2060The primary source for Aisha being nine years old comes from Sahih al-Bukhari, a collection of hadith (sayings and actions of Muhammad). However, some scholars argue that the hadith in question may have been misinterpreted or taken out of context.\n\u2022\t\u2060For example, the term \u201dnine years old\u201d could be symbolic or metaphorical rather than literal, reflecting her youthful appearance or innocence rather than her actual age.\n\n\u2014\n\n7. Timeline of Key Events\n\n\u2022\t\u2060Aisha\u2019s age is often calculated based on the timeline of key events in early Islamic history. If Aisha was born around 605 CE, as suggested by her sister Asma\u2019s age, she would have been:\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u206018-19 years old at the time of her marriage in 623-624 CE.\n\t\u2060\u2022\t\u206025-26 years old at the time of Muhammad\u2019s death in 632 CE.\n\u2022\t\u2060This aligns better with her active role in early Islamic society, including her leadership during the Battle of the Camel in 656 CE, when she would have been in her 50s.\n\n\u2014\n\nConclusion:\n\nWhile traditional Islamic sources often state that Aisha was nine years old at the time of her marriage, there is significant evidence\u2014based on historical context, the age of her sister Asma, and her active participation in early Islamic events\u2014to suggest that she may have been older, possibly in her late teens. This interpretation is supported by modern scholars who re-examine early sources and consider the cultural and historical context of 7th-century Arabia.",

This is reason to doubt your sources so far. \n\nBut lets get back to that is it permissable? Depends on the context.\n\n If its baby, its not. if its a child, its not. If girl/boy have their first menstruation/ejaculation, it is. I remember My first ejaculation was around 12, my oldest sister had her period start around 11 and youngest around 13. \n\nSooo by the rule we were ready for marriage coz we can produce the kid now BUT by the state law we couldnt get married until 18 years old. \n\nso thats why context matter, in arabia in that time  it was normal after first period/ejaculation to get married. \n\nAs far as i learned from other comments and checked the source, Islam made rules to regarding to marriage so bride is allowed to choose who to marry. That means she could have said no? right? \n\nAlso her father didnt fight for her after the proposal, so that means he was okay with it. that means its normal in that society at that time. \n\nI talk like AI? okay thats new one, even tho i know i have million gramatical mistakes coz english is not my native. fells kinda like a compliment XD\n\nwhy would you think im his alt, tbh if i was him i would end it as soon as you started insutling me because thats mark of ignorant people and i dont deal with those often.

Do you realize how great of a sin that is in Islam? \n\nWithout the Hadiths, you have little to no context for the verses in the Quran. You don't even know how to pray and how many times to pray. \n\nYou can't pick and choose which Hadiths you believe in and which you do not simply because the idea of Mo being with a child disgusts you. You are not more knowledgeable about these events compared to those that lived closer to Muhammad's time. \n\nI am not trying to convince you any longer, but the people reading this post will see how slimey Muslims can be. Going so far as dropping a key part of their scripture just to defend Muhammad. \n\n>So clearly you actually don\u2019t know much.\n\nAnd so the 17 Sahih Hadiths? Sit down. \n\n>Also, you\u2019re clearly misinformed about the Quran if you think there isn\u2019t specifications on age of marriage,\n\nThere is no minimum age, idiot.

But in general, religious violence (i.e. conflict that genuinely arose primarily for religious reasons like the Crusade, Holy War, etc, thereby excluding ones like the Yellow Turban and Taiping rebellions which only used \"religion\" as a pretext) in East Asia is significantly lower in both scale, severity and frequency compared to the West and the Middle East. It is not just about the lack of deity worship or it being secondary or serving more of a ritualistic purposes for many religions, but also because of the lack of centralized organization of the religious establishment and the lack of direct involvement/participation in the state.\n\nAlso never said or implied anything to the effect of \"the East is more enlightened than the West\".",

This is because most religions tell you to not kill people, so religious wars by default are *sins in and of themselves*.\n\nAnd that last bit is key. Because Taoism never got any strong organizations for it, they never really got the chance to use religion as an excuse for war.\n\nIt\u2019s not because Taoism is somehow superior or more peaceful than other religions. It\u2019s because their internal politics made them weaker as a cohesive group.\n\nBecause East Asia\u2019s political climate was much different than Europe\u2019s or the Middle East\u2019s, they had different ways of going about these kinds of things. You can\u2019t point a finger at the difference in theology and go \u201csee western religion bad and violent\u201d, because it could have been any number of factors.\n\nBesides, the Byzantine Empire was asking for aid and the Seljuks were a threat.

What I meant by using religion as a pretext is that the \"religion aspect\" is completely phony or unimportant. There is no actual serious faith-fueled drive behind the conflict and the \"religion\" (if we can even call it that) was purely used to for the purpose of unity. For example, the Taiping Rebellion was started by a guy who supposedly dreamed about being the brother of Jesus one night and he just started his own brand of Christianity while trying to fight a civil war. You could have replaced the religion with anything else, or even remove the religious element altogether, but it won't alter the context of popular movements to overthrow the ruling Qing government of that period. \n\nThis is in major contrast to the European Crusade or the Islamic Jihad where religion is at the core of the conflict. Of course you are right in saying that all religious wars use religions as a pretext. But the defining characteristics of these conflicts are the religious forces and the doctrinal rhetorics behind them. \n\nBy the one hundred day reform, I am assuming you are referring to the failed movement to modernize the Qing? If so, there simply wasn't any religious context/background to the event that I know of, much less a driving force behind the violence (there was very little to begin with).\n\nAnd once again, never said anything to the effect of \"Eastern religions good and Western religions bad\". We were specifically talking about Taoism so I wasn't even talking about Eastern religions in general, and Taoism is just so different from the organized religions from the West and I personally see it more as a spiritual way of life and philosophy.",

In early Islamic texts, **Maj\u016bs** was used to describe **Zoroastrians**, as they were considered \"People of the Book\" like Christians and Jews, though their scriptures were later lost or altered.  \n\n### **Is This Letter Authentic?**  \nThe letter you found is one of the reported **letters Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) sent to world leaders**, including the **Byzantine Emperor, the Persian King (Kisra/Khosrow II), the Ethiopian Negus, and the Egyptian Muqawqis**. The general content of the letter is well-documented in **Islamic historical sources**, but the exact wording may differ.  \n\n#### **Sources That Mention the Letter:**  \n1. **Ibn Sa'd (Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir)** \u2013 A well-known 9th-century Islamic historian.  \n2. **Al-Tabari (Tarikh al-Tabari)** \u2013 A famous historian who recorded Islamic and Persian history.  \n3. **Sahih al-Bukhari (Hadith 4424)** \u2013 Mentions the Prophet\u2019s letters to various rulers.  \n\nThe **core message** of the letter is recorded in authentic sources, but different narrations **vary slightly in wording**. The part **\u201cif you refuse to accept Islam, you will be responsible for the sins of the Magi\u201d** is not universally agreed upon and may be a specific interpretation rather than a direct quote from early sources.  \n\n### **What Happened After This Letter?**  \n- **Kisra (Khosrow II)** reportedly **tore up the letter** in anger.  \n- When Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) heard this, he said, **\"May Allah tear his kingdom apart!\"**  \n- Later, the **Persian Empire collapsed** after the **Muslim conquest of Persia (651 CE)**.  \n\n### **Is Wikipedia\u2019s Version 100% Accurate?**  \nWikipedia is **not always reliable** because it can be edited by anyone. While the general historical event is true, the exact wording may have been slightly altered by the editor who added it. If you want the **most authentic version**, you\u2019d have to check **Islamic historical books** like Al-Tabari or Ibn Sa'd.\n\ni like to ask ChatGPT to simplify things and tell me stuff i dont understand... i checked your source with it, this is what i got...\n\nby this repsonse, your source is not 100% valid so there is a doubt in interpretation.\n\nIll check these books chat suggested if i could find online sources but so far i have many doubts in peoples responses and sources that are non muslim.",

It's also fairly straightforward, as you're not supposed to \"interpret\" it in any way; in the original Arabic it says what it means and means what it says. That's also why a translation isn't considered \"true\", because by definition a translation includes the translators interpretations.\n\nThe problem comes with the Hadiths, the \"teachings\" of Mohammed. These include day-to-day rulings of Mohammed as leader, or just random quotes, which weren't the words of God but of Mohammed himself. As Muslims seek to emulate Mohammed's way of life these are incredibly important as a guide to good living, even though the Quran itself warns repeatedly against this type of idolatry.\n\nMany of these sayings were \"remembered\" by people who knew him decades after Mohammed's death, and conveniently tended to support whatever argument they were making at the time. So, while Mohammed's views on women and warfare was about 1300 years ahead of its time (the West caught up in the late 1800s), many of the most misogynist parts of Islam were from one of the later leaders of Islam who hated women, who'd \"remember\" things Mohammed had told him. So, that's where most of the \"shut up and cover up\"-rules come from.\n\nMuslims are aware of the danger of people having lied, so hadiths are kind of ranked according to how many witnesses were there to hear it said, the character of the witness, etcetc. However, they're still open to interpretation and you can always find hadiths to support almost any argument. I'd argue that their very existence are counter to everything Mohammed tried to accomplish with the Quran, but there you go.",

A guy from my high school married a 15 year old with parental consent when he was 19.\n\nYes, this is disgusting and wrong. But to imagine that we do much better as a society right now is a fallacy. Child marriage is still very much a problem in the modern western world. If you're gonna single out a guy from hundreds of years ago for a thing *modern americans* do, just to direct hate and rage at an entire culture... doesn't that seem a little less than genuine?",

Her own father was literally nagging Mohammed to sleep with his 9-yesr-old daughter. Like I said, the tribes considered women as little more than cattle before Mohammed changed that, as weird as that seems to us today when Mohammed's views are the ones that seem archaic and misogynist.\n\nIt is awful TO US, but it really is useless to try to impose our morals on the past.",

The fact that it was revealed to someone from a humble background is another sign for us to never look down on people by profession (This is a capitalistic/materialistic mindset but I don't wanna get into that).\n\nArabs at the time got their best poets and writers to attempt to imitate the Quran but were not able to do so despite being incredibly competent wordcrafts.\n\nAs for the multiple interpretations as long as they are coming from reputable sources and scholars, and do not contradict the main principles of the Quran (Don't steal, don't murder...etc) then that is accepted but not as a means to reinterpret as one sees fit. The punishment for altering the Quran in meaning or in writing is a steep one (In the afterlife that is).",

Yes, religion is intertwined with politics but never has Islam been used as a reason for war. You'll want to mention Al-Qaeda and ISIS/ISIL but if you look at who was mostly affected and murdered by those assholes, you'd find it was muslims themselves. A Jordanian pilot was burned on live TV for all the world to see after he was captured. \n\n\nReligion has always been intertwined with politics. Have a look at the US and their evangelical hard right Supreme court and the overturning of Roe v Wade or how the Republicans are trying to abolish gay marriage. \nAgain, there are 2 billion muslims on Earth. The actions of an outlier does not vilify an entire religion. If it did, then the same logic should apply to every religion or group of people which is absurd.",

Ignoring the definition of terrorism entirely and ignoring the cause of these conflicts entirely, both of which are pretty big details. There is a massive difference here. One would is constantly being committed explicitly in the name of Islam while none of your examples other than the Crusades are acts committed explicitly in the name of Christianity. Your only example that is even remotely valid is from nearly a from 800+ years ago. If we really want to get into conflicts explicitly committed in the name of a religion from that long ago Islam still loses just through the Arab conquests alone. North Africa, parts of Eastern Europe, Western Asia, and the rest of the Middle East didn't just peacefully decide to make their culture and religion more Arab.\n\nThe difference here is wild, they are not even comparable. The vast, vast majority of the Christian world went through secularization during their enlightenment period while Islamic culture simply has not. Islamic culture today is in many ways more dogmatic and closed minded than it was hundreds of years ago during the Islamic Golden Age. It is one of the best examples on the planet of a regressive society/culture.",

Descendants of those people via the matrilineal line are still called Jews. Jewish. Like English. In the last 300 years (or really since Jews were exiled from the piece of land that defined them as a nation) in order to stay connected to one another in exile, the laws, religious practise, culture, traditions that the state of Judea instituted as laws in their country was packaged up into a suitcase that the people of Judea took with them into exile and replicated in the various places they lived. This later became known as Judaism. Not everyone can practise Judaism as it's a closed practise. Practising Judaism alone does not make you a Jew. Many of the people in Israel (in fact most) do not practise Judaism. They are Jews though. Also as an aside many aren't Jewish by Jewish law but have Jewish ancestors. The law of return is not for Jews alone but for Jews, and their 1st and 2nd generation descendants. Internally people not recognised as Jewish by Jewish law are not recognised as Jewish by the state either. This prevents them from marrying a Jew (not because intermarriage is forbidden it's that secular marriage doesn't exist in Israel and under Jewish law marriage is defined as a contract between two jews - Israel recognises non halachic marriages done outside of Israel) being buried in a Jewish graveyard or praying in a synagogue (in practise nobody would stop you though) as the Rabbanut controls Jewish identity in Israel. On the topic of conversion; yes it's possible. However the most widely accepted form of conversion: one via the orthodox movement is more akin to naturalisation. Whereas religions require you to simply adopt the religion in a fairly quick process (as it is simply adopting an idealogy) converting to Judaism is more akin to naturalisation to a country. It takes years. And a core requirement is you must live and take part in an orthodox Jewish community for a number of years, and key to finalisation as a Jew is acceptance and endorsement by the existing community. In many communities this also requires you to go and study in Israel for a period of time and live there. Like naturalisation to any country you must learn the laws, culture, traditions and pledge to uphold them. The key difference with say Xtianity or Islam is unlike those two which are religions and who say if you stop believing in the religion you are no longer an Xtian / Muslim, once you convert in Jewish law, you are always Jewish. You can be an ex Muslim or an ex Xtian but you can't be an ex jew. It's just something you are. Hence why so many Jews these days are Jewish and atheist. You can't be Muslim / Xtian and atheist. You can come from an Muslim / Xtian family and be atheist but you yourself are not one. Jewish identity works differently. This is why it's called an ethnoreligion. Jewish law obligates all Jews to uphold Jewish law that came from the Torah, but choosing not to does not change your Jewish status.",

Like 80 million people died in World War 2 but we don't call that a genocide, we call the Holocaust a genocide because of who it explicitly targeted and why. Do you think Gaza is being bombed because their people are brown, or because their government-sanctioned militia invaded Israel and brutally raped and murdered civilians then paraded the bodies of kids who had just been attending a music festival around their streets in celebration? And if you still think it's the former, and you're willing to overlook all the brown people living normal lives in Israel itself, I don't know what to fucking tell you.\n\nAlso, half of the Gazan casualties are *obviously* not children, even if Israel literally devoted every resource they had to ensuring they were killing exclusively children, they still would not be capable of achieving a statistic like that. I mean shit, if you're going that far, why not just say *all* of them were babies, and the jews drank their blood too? The fuck are you smoking?",

At this point, it is sufficient to know that Emigration from the homeland of Disbelief (Darul-kufr) was enjoined on all Muslims during the early period of Islam. It is for this reason that Allah Almighty has prohibited treating those who fail to carry out this obligation as Muslims. Consequently, when Makkah was conquered, the Holy Prophet declared: \u06be\u0650\u062c\u0631\u064e\u06c3\u064e \u0628\u064e\u0639\u062f\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0641\u064e\u062a\u062d \u0644\u064e\u0627 (There is no Hijrah after the Victory). It means: \u2018Now that the Conquest of Makkah has made it the Abode of Islam, emigration from there was no more obligatory.' This rule related to the period of time when Emigration was considered to be a pre-condition of anyone's faith. During those days, anyone who did not emigrate despite having the ability to do so was not taken to be a Muslim. But, later on, this injunction was abrogated1 and now this mode of Emigration has ceased to exist.\n\n1. It means that emigration no longer remained a pre-requisite for his being Muslim. However, if a Muslim lives in a non-Muslim country where he cannot fulfill his religious obligations, it is incumbent on him to emigrate if he has the means to do so. (Muhammad Taqi Usmani)\n\nThere remains, however, another form of Hijrah which has been identified in a hadith of Sahib al-Bukhari where it was said: \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0646\u0642\u064e\u0637\u0650\u0639\u064f \u0627\u0644\u06be\u0650\u062c\u0631\u064e\u06c3\u064f \u062d\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0651\u06cc \u062a\u064e\u0646\u0642\u064e\u0637\u0650\u0639\u064e \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064e\u0648\u0628\u064e\u06c3 . It means that Hijrah (not in the sense of abandoning one's homeland, but in the sense of abandoning one's sins) will continue to exist until there remains the time to repent.\n\n` Allamah ` Ayni, the commentator of al-Bukhari has said about this Hijrah: \u0627\u064e\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064e \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0644\u06be\u062c\u0650\u0631\u064e\u06c3\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0642\u0650\u06cc\u06c3\u0650 \u06be\u0650\u06cc\u064e \u06be\u064e\u062c\u0631\u064f \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0633\u064e\u0651\u06cc\u0650\u0651\u0627\u062a\u0650 (This later Hijrah means the abandonment of sins). This subject also finds elucidation in a hadith of the Holy Prophet \ufdfa where he is reported to have said: \u0627\u064e\u0644\u0645\u064f\u06be\u064e\u062c\u0631\u064f \u0645\u064e\u0646 \u06be\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0646\u064e\u06be\u064e\u06cc \u0627\u0644\u0644\u06c1\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0646\u06c1\u064f. It means that a Muhajir (Emigrant) is one who emigrates ('hajara': abandon, leave) from everything prohibited by Allah Almighty (al-Mirqat, v.1)\n\nThe discussion appearing above tells us that, technically, the word, Hijrah is applied in a dual sense:\n\n1. To leave one's homeland in order to save one's faith as was done by the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all - they left their homeland of Makkah and emigrated to Madinah and Ethiopia.\n\n2. To leave one's sins.\n\nThe words of the verse 89: \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u062a\u0651\u064e\u062e\u0650\u0630\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0651\u064b\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0646\u064e\u0635\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064b\u200c\u0627 (and do not take from them a friend or a helper) tell us that seeking help from disbelievers is forbidden (Haram). Pursuant to this, it appears in a narration that the Ansars of Madinah sought the permission of the Holy Prophet $ to seek help from the Jews to offset disbelievers whereupon\n\nhe said: v 'I (The bad ones! We do not need them). (Mazhari, v.2",

The context is that polytheists broke their treaty, attacked the allies of muslim. For those who wants to learn:\n\n\nSurah At-Tawbah (9:1-10):\n\n1. [This is] a declaration of disassociation from Allah and His Messenger to those with whom you had made a treaty among the polytheists.\n\n2. So travel freely, [O disbelievers], throughout the land for four months but know that you cannot cause failure to Allah and that Allah will disgrace the disbelievers.\n\n3. And [this is] an announcement from Allah and His Messenger to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage that Allah is disassociated from the disbelievers, and [so is] His Messenger. So if you repent, that is best for you, but if you turn away, then know that you will not cause failure to Allah. And give tidings to those who disbelieve of a painful punishment.\n\n4. Excepted are those with whom you made a treaty among the polytheists and then they have not been deficient toward you in anything or supported anyone against you; so complete for them their treaty until their term [has ended]. Indeed, Allah loves the righteous [who fear Him].\n\n5. And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them [go] on their way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n6. And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the words of Allah. Then deliver him to his place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.\n\n7. How can there be for the polytheists a treaty in the sight of Allah and with His Messenger, except for those with whom you made a treaty at al-Masjid al-Haram? So as long as they are upright toward you, be upright toward them. Indeed, Allah loves the righteous [who fear Him].\n\n8. How [can there be a treaty] while, if they gain dominance over you, they do not observe concerning you any pact of kinship or covenant of protection? They satisfy you with their mouths, but their hearts refuse [commitment], and most of them are defiantly disobedient.\n\n9. They have exchanged the signs of Allah for a small price and averted [people] from His way. Indeed, it was evil that they were doing.\n\n10. They do not observe toward a believer any pact of kinship or covenant of protection. And it is they who are the transgressors.",

So at the end of the day there is a balance to it.\n\nI think Arabs have to put in effort in the opposite direction in not becoming complacent and lazy because they were handed it on silver platter, different struggles I guess",

Same way how some people are born into a rich family while others born into a poor one. Some get to survive till 80 while others don't even get to live sadly... There are many differences but the real test is to strive even given THOSE conditions.\n\nTreat life like a game where you're generated a random seed. Some get lucky others not so much.

All the congregation shall certainly stone him, the stranger as well as him who is born in the land. When he blasphemes the name of the Lord, he shall be put to death.\"\n\n2 Chronicles 15:13\n\n\"That whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.\"\n\nOh, and here's a random one for good measure. This one really brings new contexts when people say it's a book of love:\n\nEzekiel 23:20\n\n\"There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses. So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled.\"\n\nNow let's play the game of how long before someone says, \"That's out of context,\" or \"the old testament doesn't count!\". Nuance only exists to those looking for it. Imagine a modern group so lost on the history of their own beliefs and how it propagated around the world that they hold any others as the aggressor. Please tell me, oh, followers of Jesus, how Christianity responded throughout history as it moved around the globe through all but the most modern of times. I'm sure it was just missionaries and pamphlet gently nudging everyone down \"the path.\", surely no one would ever go on conversion crusades /s.\n\nRather than crucifying anyone else, I'll just let his words speak, \"Let him who is without sin among you, cast the first stone...\". \n\nI was born and raised Christian, and Christians are the ones that made me turn my back on it. Religion serves a great good for many, but also enables terrible people to do terrible things. So let's not split hairs\n\nAll faiths find peace in their beliefs, defence in its words, and justification for or against anything anywhere it's needed if necessary. Imagine not grouping everyone into a thing, or just a modicum of respect, empathy, or leaning a little less on how absolutely sure everyone is of theirs being the \"right one\". If your faith isn't making you be a better person to those around you, regardless of thier beliefs, you're using it wrong. I'm pretty sure they damn near all say to be kind to everyone else somewhere in there. Maybe lean on that one a bit more, the world could definitely use it.\n\n(Apologies poster above me, this is just where I happened to land in my thoughts and it was in reply for to you. As-Salaam-Alaikum, Peace Be Upon You, Shalom Aleichem, or just a general Wishing You the Best.)",

So I did what I wasn't supposed to do, and read the other scriptures, books, etc., but most importantly I went to engage with those who believed different than me. I made friends, I traveled, and had them show me \"a day in the faith/life\" or however you'd like to call it.\n\nI went to mosques and temples, spoke with imams and rabbis, or anyone else i could get some authority from for answers. \n\nSome would consider this next statement sad, but I found myself moving further away from faith the more I dug. However, I landed so much closer to humanity, and ironically I now carry so much more respect for faith and belief than I ever had in the past. While it's not for me, I've shared others faith, because they wanted to, they offered to let me experience it how they do and letting yourself live in something so personal to someone else, if done genuinely, absolutely changes you fundamentally.\n\nWe are all just looking for purpose, to know we are here for a reason, and that there's more to everything past the \"end.\" Telling someone their purpose is crazy because the thing they follow is obviously the right one, is asinine. Even becoming faithless as some might say, I value others faith, as I know what I lost when I lost mine. It's part of who you are, part of your core. I would never try to convince someone the path I've taken is right, nor any other path is better regarding faith. \n\nI know this all sounds a bit utopian or cliche I'm sure, but even for all it's evils and self-righteousness, I found my faith in others. Maybe more of a spirituality. Respect and kindness given freely or without caveats (like having to be earned), is not only how I try to engage in every interaction with anyone, but I genuinely believe that it's the foundation to most every faith.\n\n(Edit: i wanted to add a huge emphasis on \"try\", someone people just want to push, I'm not above base emotions by anymeans)",

Look at the verses from 190-193:\n\n\"Fight in the cause of Allah \u02f9only\u02fa against those who wage war against you, but do not exceed the limits. Allah does not like transgressors. Kill them wherever you come upon them\u00a0and drive them out of the places from which they have driven you out. For persecution\u00a0is far worse than killing. And do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque unless they attack you there. If they do so, then fight them\u2014that is the reward of the disbelievers. But if they cease, then surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Fight against them \u02f9if they persecute you\u02fa until there is no more persecution, and \u02f9your\u02fa devotion will be to Allah \u02f9alone\u02fa. If they stop \u02f9persecuting you\u02fa, let there be no hostility except against the aggressors.\"\n\nThese verses were revealed because the Muslims were being persecuted and they had a treaty with a group of non-Muslims which had been broken by the non-Muslims. \n\nIslam is not a **pacifist** religion. Wars happen, people break their contracts and their treaties. This was what had happened and it was said that if you are being persecuted then fight the oppressors but do not transgress the limits (the limits are what are in the picture that OP has posted). You can read the verses yourself.",

He did so during an ongoing civil war and this put to end the persecution that had tried to 'stomp them out'.\n\nNext up was the fall of Rome, which the Papacy managed to endure, converting the barbarians into Christians from Pagans. After this came the dark ages which saw Christianity surviving the fall of Rome, civilising Western Europe (and interesting Ireland had a big part of this).\n\nThen we get to the Middle Ages, where indeed we have the crusades. These were very complicated affairs but it is enough to say that they were not spreading the religion as it was there already.\n\nThen comes the Age of Discovery, where we find Christian Europeans meeting Christian Indians who were descended from an apostles original teachers (sadly they were mistreated due to accusations of heresy). We find the New World being civilised by missionaries who are in step with the Spanish but not leading them. They are independent of the gold searching privateers and concerned for the souls of the pagans.\n\nSo it is really, very different from Islam which exploded out of Saudi Arabia via conquest, committed Genocide so severely that if you check an Ethnic map of Middle East and North Africa it all says Arab now, and they certainly didn't follow these rules given.",

It comes from the book. How else would multiple groups, in multiple locations, across multiple points in time, come to the same conclusion about a singular message? \n\n>why does the specific religion matter?\n\nThe Quran tells it's followers to kill nonbelievers. You don't get to say mass-killing isn't war just because it makes you look like shit. \n\nhttps://www.thereligionofpeace.com/attacks/attacks.aspx?Yr=Last30",

They have to wear a turban at all times, but will not hesitate to use it as a bandage / sling / whatever if they're passing sooner who needs it. They have pretty restricted diets and rules but any schoolkid knows that anyone can walk into any Sikh temple at any time and get food, and shelter if you need it too, they might just strongly suggest you take a scarf to cover up if you're not temple-decent.\n\n\n\n\nIncidentally, we think of the USA as very religious too, and some of the Christians I met there will always stand out in my memory as among the kindest people I've ever met. They didn't preach, weren't interested in spreading the word or dressing a certain way, they didn't even seem super interested in what my religion is (I'm northern European, so 'Christmas, Easter and church weddings style atheism'), they just took every opportunity they could to do good, be kind, and said grace before meals.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n99% of depictions I've seen on any media of any religion has been negative, inflammatory, unnecessary or just kinda 'well they're free to think those weird, faintly stupid things', but 99% of religious people I've actually met have been somewhere between normal, nice, and really inspirationally wholesome.",

At least have an informed critical opinion instead of spewing nonsense.\n\nFor example, I\u2019m an apostate of Islam and I\u2019m still alive and literally no one I know has done anything to me or even tried.

Leaves me alone and we get on just fine.\n\nYes, in some places you\u2019ll probably be persecuted or killed, in other places they\u2019ll leave you alone. Islam isn\u2019t monolithic, there\u2019s lots of different practices varying from moderate (who drink, so drugs and gamble), even total progressives to the extremists. There\u2019s lots and lots of middle-ground.\n\nJust look at the history of Islam and LGBT if you want an interesting reading, go back to the Golden Age and see how long it takes until we get to the persecution.\n\nHint: British colonialism and the import of extreme Christian doctrine and punishments. What? Am I saying it\u2019s a recent thing? Yes, yes it is.\n\nDo your reading.\nKnow your history.\nHave an informed opinion.",

                    "body": "Listen here little boy , stop babbling shit and understand it first \n\nThe verses you mentioned are often cited in discussions about Islam and violence, but they are frequently taken out of context or misrepresented. To understand them properly, they must be read within the broader context of the Qur\u2019an, including historical background, linguistic nuances, and traditional Islamic interpretations.\n\n1. Qur\u2019an 2:191 - \u201cSlay them wherever you find them.\u201d\n\nContext:\nThis verse refers to a specific historical event\u2014the conflict between Muslims and the Quraysh tribe in Mecca. The full passage (2:190\u2013193) makes it clear that fighting is only permitted in self-defense and against oppression:\n\n\u201cFight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed, Allah does not like transgressors.\u201d (2:190)\n\nThis means that warfare is not unprovoked but rather a response to aggression.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n2. Qur\u2019an 8:39 - \u201cFight them until there is no more Fitnah.\u201d\n\nContext:\nThe word fitnah in Arabic means persecution or oppression, specifically referring to the persecution Muslims faced in early Mecca. The full verse emphasizes that war should end when oppression ceases:\n\n\u201cAnd fight them until there is no more persecution and religion is for Allah. But if they cease, then there is to be no aggression except against the oppressors.\u201d (8:39)\n\nThis verse does not call for violence against non-Muslims in general but addresses a historical war against those who were actively persecuting Muslims.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n3. Qur\u2019an 5:33 - \u201cMaim and crucify the infidels if they criticize Islam.\u201d\n\nContext:\nThe actual verse refers to severe punishment for those who commit acts of treason and violent rebellion, not mere criticism of Islam:\n\n\u201cThe recompense of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and spread corruption in the land is execution, crucifixion, the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land\u2026\u201d (5:33)\n\nThis refers to criminals who spread \u201ccorruption\u201d through murder, highway robbery, or rebellion\u2014not simply critics of Islam.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n4. Qur\u2019an 8:12 - \u201cTerrorize and behead those who believe in scriptures other than the Qur\u2019an.\u201d\n\nContext:\nThe verse actually states:\n\n\u201cI will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. So strike [them] upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip.\u201d (8:12)\n\nThis verse was revealed during the Battle of Badr, when outnumbered Muslims fought against the Quraysh army that sought to destroy them. It is not a general command but a specific wartime strategy.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n5. Qur\u2019an 8:60 - \u201cMuslims must muster all weapons to terrorize the infidels.\u201d\n\nContext:\nThe verse actually says:\n\n\u201cAnd prepare against them whatever you are able of power and steeds of war by which you may terrify the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know but whom Allah knows.\u201d (8:60)\n\nHere, terror refers to military deterrence\u2014not random violence against civilians. The verse encourages defensive military preparedness.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n6. Qur\u2019an 9:123 - \u201cMake war on the infidels living in your neighborhood.\u201d\n\nContext:\nThe verse states:\n\n\u201cO you who have believed, fight those adjacent to you of the disbelievers and let them find in you harshness.\u201d (9:123)\n\nAgain, this refers to a specific historical context in which Muslims were at war with hostile tribes. It is not a general command to attack peaceful non-Muslims.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n7. Qur\u2019an 47:4 - \u201cDo not hanker for peace with the infidels; behead them when you catch them.\u201d\n\nContext:\nThe verse states:\n\n\u201cSo when you meet those who disbelieve in battle, strike [their] necks until, when you have inflicted slaughter upon them, then secure their bonds, and either [confer] favor afterwards or ransom [them] until the war lays down its burdens.\u201d (47:4)\n\nThis is a battlefield instruction for a time of war, with clear rules on treating prisoners afterward. The verse does not call for indiscriminate violence.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nThe Qur\u2019an does not command Muslims to wage an unprovoked war against non-Muslims. Many of these verses refer to specific historical conflicts where Muslims were being attacked and persecuted. The Qur\u2019an also contains numerous verses promoting peace, such as:\n\t\u2022\t\u201cThere is no compulsion in religion.\u201d (2:256)\n\t\u2022\t\u201cIf they incline toward peace, then incline to it [also] and rely upon Allah.\u201d (8:61)",

The full context (2:190-193) emphasizes fighting only those who attack first and stopping when they cease hostilities.\n\n>**Qur'an 8:39** \u2013 This refers to fighting against persecution and religious oppression. The phrase \"until there is no more Fitnah\" means until there is no persecution against Muslims for practicing their faith.\n\n>**Qur'an 5:33** \u2013 This verse does not say \"maim and crucify the infidels for criticizing Islam.\" It discusses the punishment for highway robbery and rebellion, similar to laws in other legal systems.\n\n>**Qur'an 8:12** \u2013 This was a specific command to the angels during the Battle of Badr, not a general instruction for Muslims.\n\n>**Qur'an 8:60** \u2013 This verse advises Muslims to prepare for self-defense, not to engage in unprovoked aggression.\n\n>**Qur'an 9:123** \u2013 This is about defense against hostile forces, not harming innocent neighbors.\n\n>**Qur'an 47:4** \u2013 This verse refers to the conduct of war and instructs to fight enemies in battle but also emphasizes the importance of peace when possible.\n\n>The Qur'an promotes justice, self-defense, and peace.

                    "body": "**Regarding Verse 2:190-193 (Kill them wherever you come upon them...):**\n\nEven with the context of persecution, this verse can be interpreted to justify offensive actions beyond mere defense. The phrase \"until there is no more persecution\u2014and \u02f9your\u02fa devotion will be entirely to Allah\" can be interpreted as requiring submission to Islam as the condition for peace, not just cessation of hostilities. AND HISTORICALLY THAT IS THE WAY MUSLIMS USED IT. They used this and many other verses to justify offensive jihad. This raises questions about whether the goal is truly just self-defense or the establishment of religious dominance. Also, who defines 'persecution'? This can be easily broadened to include any opposition to Islam or any law-system which is not islamic. Are we not familiar with the numerous insurgencies in secular states which have islamist jihadists killing everyone left right and center for the political demand to create an islamic state?\n\nWhat you're missing is that *EVEN ISIS USES THIS VERSE TO JUSTIFY ITSELF*. Because Muhammad and sahabah used this verse and similar ones to justify offensive warfare to spread islam. Its the same reasoning as Russia has \"ethnic russians in your territory are being oppressed\". So lets maybe try to stop lawyering the most unislamic and moderate interpretation of a verse which muhammad/his companions interpreted in the most violent way possible. Remember, the sahabah (companions) and muhammad decides how to interpret this shit. You as an ordinary islamic follower don't. and they chose the violent interpretation through their **actions**.\n\n**Regarding Verse 5:33 (Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah...):**\n\nThe terms \"wage war against Allah and His Messenger\" and \"spread mischief\" are open to interpretation. Throughout history, and even in contemporary times, these phrases have been used to justify violence against those who criticize Islam, leave Islam, or challenge Islamic political authority. The definition of \"mischief\" can be very broad and subjective. While the verse mentions these specific actions, the application of these terms can easily extend beyond actual warfare to include religious or ideological opposition.\n\n**A**lso, here's a few more to chew on:\n\nQuran 9:5 (Surah At-Tawbah):  \n\"But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war); but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practice regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\"\n\nQuran 2:191 (Surah Al-Baqarah)  \n\"And slay them wherever ye catch them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out; for tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter; but fight them not at the Sacred Mosque, unless they (first) fight you there; but if they fight you, slay them. Such is the reward of those who suppress faith.\"\n\nQuran 5:33 (Surah Al-Ma\u2019idah)  \n\"The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter.\"\n\nQuran 47:4 (Surah Muhammad)  \n\"Therefore, when ye meet the Unbelievers (in fight), smite at their necks; at length, when ye have thoroughly subdued them, bind a bond firmly (on them): thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or ransom: until the war lays down its burdens.\"\n\nQuran 9:29 (Surah At-Tawbah)  \n\"Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the Religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.\"\n\nQuran 8:39 (Surah Al-Anfal)  \n\"And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression (fitnah), and there prevail justice and faith in Allah altogether and everywhere; but if they cease, let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression.\"\n\nQuran 8:60 (Surah Al-Anfal)  \n\"Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into (the hearts of) the enemies of Allah and your enemies...\"\n\nQuran 4:34 (Surah An-Nisa)  \n\"Men are the protectors and maintainers of women... As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) strike them\"\n\nQuran 8:12 (Surah Al-Anfal)  \n\"I will instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips off them.\"",

However the man he picked was on his deathbed having received a deadly wound in the battle.\n\nHe ruled the men to be beheaded and the women and children be sold into slavery. So the women and children were spared and reintroduced into society. Some reverted, some were bought by other Jews. Prophet Muhammed didn't disagree with the ruling as it was a befitting punishment for the Banu Qurayza for their treason and breaking of the treaty.\n\nThe decision to attack them was also from a command from God so again not something Muhammed did at his own whim. God's commands can override other commands.\n\nIslamic jurisprudence is complicated and for scholars and law makers to figure out in a very complex and vigorous methodology that'd been set from the time just after the death of the prophet.

Turns out research puts the rate of mortality and major disability rates between sibling union or parent-child union between [22-36%](https://books.google.com/books?id=OW1nuQxcIQgC&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false).

I don\u2019t derive morality through personal experience and feelings. I view morality from what I believe is an objective truth based on rationality and objectiveness.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m engaging with you and seeing where you get your morality because if there is a better truth, I would follow that. Subjective morality is definitely not better tho. It\u2019s fickle and changing and self-serving. And riddled with inconsistencies. \n\nFor me, incest is objectively wrong mostly because God says so but also theres obvious wisdom in that (social contract of familial relationships that are essential for raising children and maintaining order in a home) There are roles in a family unit and sexual relationships within siblings or parents or other familial power dynamics would cause harm in families, thus hurt societies. \n\nSo, only physical harm to others is wrong then? Do you see how that\u2019s also not gonna work\u2026\n\nNo, that\u2019s not what you should do. Actually, I would argue that slavery was rampant because people just accepted it rather than objectively think about its morality. It was considered societally moral at the time so people were ok w it. \n\nIf \u201cdo not harm\u201d doesn\u2019t work, You should be sincere about that, investigate other forms of morality and find one you think is true and not problematic. there\u2019s hundreds of them!

But that said, it is fair to say that, the behavior of marrying a child, is not acceptable in modern times, is it not ?\n\nCan we agree that, even if at the time of the Prophet, even if his actions were not unjust, through the lens of progress, we should abandon that thought process ?\n\nThere is no such thing as a fully mature woman, when we are talking about 9 year olds. The human brain isn't fully developed, the human body isn't fully developed. The differential in power dynamics is completely messed. When we talk about adults, who are capable of making their own decisions, we can say - if two people are fine with it, then its alright. But when we are talking about children, who are easily manipulable, we don't force them into such irreversible decisions. \n\nBeing engaged to another man, doesn't absolve anything. It still is what it is. Even if it was the norm back then, it cannot be anything more than an outdated idea (at best) in modern times. \n\nThere are many sides to a story, but after the dust settles, its important to learn what to take away and what to discard. Some people's actions may have been justified in their time, but as time marches on, standards shift and society needs to evolve and adapt to continue its path of progress. \n\nI find clinging to such ideas a detriment to the progress of humanity. As living beings. Our greatest strength has been our ability to understand the world around us and learn to make use of it. Abdicating that for the unknown is not something I can see, in an lens, to be anything aligned to our path forward.",

Doesn't matter the climate, doesn't matter the geology, race, whatever. There's a reason such a thing was wide spread before modern times, but there's also a reason we have abandoned such practices as a more humane society. \n\nI'm sorry, but if that is the point we are debating, then I'm afraid, I have to withdraw from this discussion. This is as patient as I can be, when talking about things like this. \n\nWe haven't been given a brain, to mindlessly follow (if we believe, we were infact, *given* one), but rather to question and evolve.

Not so with Islam, because everything down to how you are allowed to use the toilet (no speaking or distractions while you poopoo or peepee because that offends :( Allah) is addressed with a command. \nChristian men sometimes married minors because they wanted to and the morality of interrupting her development didn't concern them. Feminists and social progressives in the 1800s began promoting the idea of 18 being the age of consent and this idea was able to be adopted by western majority Christian countries because the Bible doesn't explicitly say that the dude who lived the most perfect life a human male can live married and consummated with a 9 year old child and that in all things his example should be followed. There is no possibility of progressive social reform under Islam because Muslims point to something a warlord did 1500 years ago and say that they have to be able to follow his example. That's why Islam is dangerous. \nAlso, please name 5 Christian kings who married and consummated with a girl under the age of 12...\nThe only example I can think of is Owen Tudor (not a king) marrying Margaret Beaufort who was 13, but that is not under 12 and it was even a scandal in the 1400s. \nBetrothals to children which were consummated much later don't count either.",

They lived in a specific time and context, and their actions were often meant to address the issues of that time, not necessarily to follow the standards we have today. Just because someone acts differently from what we expect doesn\u2019t automatically mean they\u2019re corrupt or not fulfilling their divine mission. It's about understanding the deeper purpose behind their actions, not just judging them based on our modern-day perspective. Prophets were meant to challenge and guide, not to follow the corrupted norms of society. But that doesn't mean their actions were always meant to be replicated exactly in today\u2019s world.",

Let\u2019s see what kind of verses the Quran revealed after having a strong army, while it initially advised peace and refraining from war when it was weak. \n\n1. Nisa 89 (Surah An-Nisa 4:89)\n\"They wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike. So do not take them as allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper.\"\n\n2. Maide 33 (Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:33)\n\"Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world, and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment.\"\n\n3. Tevbe 5 (Surah At-Tawbah 9:5)\n\"And when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, let them [go] on their way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\"\n\n4. Nisa 24 (Surah An-Nisa 4:24)\n\"And [also prohibited to you are] married women, except those whom your right hands possess as captives of war. This is the decree of Allah for you. Beyond these, it is lawful for you to seek [wives] with your wealth in marriage, desiring chastity and not unlawful relations. So, for the enjoyment you have with them, give them their due compensation as an obligation. There is no sin upon you in what you mutually agree upon beyond this. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing and All-Wise.\"\n\n5. Tevbe 5 (Surah At-Tawbah 9:12)\n\"And if they break their oaths after their treaty and attack your religion with words, then kill them and fight the leaders of disbelief, for indeed, they have no regard for their oaths. Perhaps they will desist.\"",

It's often said that young basketball players worshipped Michael Jordan or LeBron James. They don't literally think they are God, they just look up to those people and wish they could be more like them, which from my understanding is the exact relationship most Muslims have with the prophet Muhammed, just in life not in basketball.\n\n\n\nNot trying to be mean but is English your first language?

The 2 million Arabs who live in Israel are descendants of Arabs that did not flee in 1948,  and are referred to as 48 Palestinians. The Palestinians that live in the West Bank and Gaza were the Arabs that were displaced/expelled in 1948 \u2014 but Egypt controlled Gaza and Jordan annexed the West Bank. Israel conquered and occupied those territories in the Sux Day War in 1967. Those Palestinians never accepted Israel along with the surrounding Arab countries.

I'm genuinely uncomfortable to say it if it carries baggage in Israel's case in particular, but the idea itself is all that I meant by it--That most if not all countries are dominated by a single culture/ethnic group, and racism and ethnocentrism naturally evolve because of it. Romania is 89% ethnic romanian, Japan is 98% Japanese, sure, but even if a country is 50% group X, if the second highest group is only like 20%, and the next 3%, and it just keeps going until 100%, then realistically the 3% is probably gonna experience bad racism, the 20% may or may not, and the 50% is unlikely to in any governmentally-significant way (though that still occurs sometimes, of course).",

And that is the one whose menstruation has stopped due to her older age. Her Iddah is three months instead of the three monthly cycles for those who menstruate, which is based upon the Ayah in (Surat) Al-Baqarah. see 2:228 The same for the young, who have not reached the years of menstruation. Their `Iddah is three months like those in menopause. This is the meaning of His saying; (and for those who have no courses...)\n\nAsbab Al-Nuzul by Al-Wahidi\n\nAnd for such of your women as despair of menstruation\u2026) [65:4]. Said Muqatil: \u201cWhen the verse (Women who are divorced shall wait, keeping themselves apart\u2026), Kallad ibn al-Nu\u2018man ibn Qays al-Ansari said: \u2018O Messenger of Allah, what is the waiting period of the woman who does not menstruate and the woman who has not menstruated yet? And what is the waiting period of the pregnant woman?\u2019 And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse\u201d. Abu Ishaq al-Muqri\u2019 informed us> Muhammad ibn \u2018Abd Allah ibn Hamdun> Makki ibn \u2018Abdan> Abu\u2019l-Azhar> Asbat ibn Muhammad> Mutarrif> Abu \u2018Uthman \u2018Amr ibn Salim who said: \u201cWhen the waiting period for divorced and widowed women was mentioned in Surah al-Baqarah, Ubayy ibn Ka\u2018b said; \u2018O Messenger of Allah, some women of Medina are saying: there are other women who have not been mentioned!\u2019 He asked him: \u2018And who are they?\u2019 He said: \u2018Those who are too young [such that they have not started menstruating yet], those who are too old [whose menstruation has stopped] and those who are pregnant\u2019. And so this verse (And for such of your women as despair of menstruation\u2026) was revealed\u201d.\n\nIbn Hanbal is claimed to have set nine as the age at which a bride cannot be kept from her husband. Others like Abu Hanifa said maintenance waits until maturity (hatta tablugh). Shafi'i used phrases like her being able to tolerate (mithluh\u0101) intercourse or Abu Hanifa that she had come of age and could tolerate intercourse with a man (tudrik wa tu\u1e6d\u012bq al-rij\u0101l). Prepubescent consummation was explicitly discussed by Shafi'i, and implicitly by Ibn Hanbal given he (according to Ibn Qudama) specified nine.\n\nAbu Hanifa - page 97\n\nMalik - 116-7\n\nShafi'i (and Ibn al Mundhir) - 134, 179\n\nIbn Hanbal (and Ibn Qudama) - page 139 footnote 65, pages 212-4, 7, 10, 12, 17, 20\n\nThis is all based on the historic scholarship indicating that Muhammad consummated marriage with a 9 year old girl. Do you think 9 years old is an acceptable age to marry? Here are some hadith references (all Sahih, authentic) which indicate Aisha was a small girl, playing with dolls and swings:\n\nhttps://sunnah.com/abudawud:4935\n\nhttps://sunnah.com/abudawud:4933\n\nhttps://sunnah.com/bukhari:6130\n\nFrom the last hadith:\n\n(The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for `Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.)",

This friend decided that they should be punished according to their religious law. So, my point is that Islam is very critical against betrayal, and the harsh punishment is given according to bani qurayzha 's religious law. The prophet is a holy man (he forgave the Makkah people during conquest of Makkah, and he forgave the people of Thaif even though God allow him to wish disaster upon them), but he is not someone who will overlook betrayal.",

Is he a banu qurayza spokesperson or is he a prophet meant to bring a truth superior to other truths? That he would even stoop to such a thing betrays a lack of character: instead of being the bigger man, replacing an old ignorance with new truth, he went for the worst he could get away with.\n\nAnd I can't help but notice that you made no issue of the fact that Islam allows slavery and rape.",

He ordered the assassination a woman poet who had made fun of him. He gave his men the order to destroy the Kaaba of Yemen (and to kill every worshiper/preacher there).

When explicitly asked if there was a risk of enemy women and children being killed during one of his raids, he stated this as a means of giving the OK: \"**They are from them**.\".\n\nThis list is only useful as a spark for reminding people just how bad it actually gets in Islam.",

Every major power today has killed off or jailed propagandists who threatened national security.\n\nMeanwhile Muhammad PBUH stayed silent when an old Jewish woman mocked and insulted him every day. Instead he visited her when she fell ill and stopped.\n\nCaptured slave-women from enemy camps during battle were universally put in harems, from before Judaism through to Christianity and Islam, across the globe. The only difference with Muslims is that they afforded them extra rights and protections, and strongly incentivized freeing them. It\u2019s not like they were going into towns and raping the populace.\n\nEven now and in recent history, women captured in war and routinely raped.\n\nHe was asked about women and children being killed in a *night* raid on an enemy camp, because of the ban.

And here's a cool guide to how Islam mandates war and violence against non-Muslims:\n\nhttps://sunnah.com/muslim:22\n\nSahih Muslim 22\nIt has been narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. 'Umar that the Messenger of Allah said:\n\nI have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, and they establish prayer, and pay Zakat and if they do it, their blood and property are guaranteed protection on my behalf except when justified by law, and their affairs rest with Allah.\n\nhttps://quran.com/9/111?translations=39,33,25,31,27,43,23,75,32,38,52,77,20,101,18,22,19,21,17,84,95,85,34,83\n\nQuran 9:111\n\nIndeed, All\u0101h has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties [in exchange] for that they will have Paradise. They fight in the cause of All\u0101h, so they kill and are killed. [It is] a true promise [binding] upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur\u2019\u0101n. And who is truer to his covenant than All\u0101h? So rejoice in your transaction which you have contracted. And it is that which is the great attainment.\n\n\nAnd here's some light reading on slavery in Islam. Remember, kids, enslaving others is fine in Islam, as long as they are non-Muslims!\n\nhttps://atheism-vs-islam.com/index.php/islamic-slavery/47-crimes-of-islamic-slavery-against-humanity",

I thought they did but by speaking with Muslims online and a some friends I have, it turns out they don't. I think most good kind Muslim people just kind of ignore the wild passages and focus on the one speaking about kindness, good deeds, etc. But those passages are still there and anyone can use religious tribalism to conduct violence based on those, with very little chance of resistance internally. \n\nSee for example how they threat so called \"blasphemy\" in Pakistan, there is a linchying every now and then because someone accuses someone else of blasphemy, and it's a mob that carries out the violence. Do you think that mentality does not permeate to the army? The army is just a statistical sample of society. \n\nSo again coming back to your original point, I highly doubt they will actually engage with this rules. Maybe some will try but it will be impossible for good people to go against the mass specially in a conflict",

There must be a reasonable chance or hope of success.\n\n4. The act of self defense cannot escalate things so as to cause further death or hardship than what is to be expected from the beginning.

But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun(the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.)\"*\n\n[Tabari 7:97](https://www.kalamullah.com/tabari.html)\u00a0*The morning after the murder of Ashraf, the Prophet declared, \"Kill any Jew who falls under your power.\"*\u00a0Ashraf was a poet, killed by Muhammad's men because he insulted Islam. Here, Muhammad widens the scope of his orders to kill. An innocent Jewish businessman was then slain by his Muslim partner, merely for being non-Muslim.\n\n[Sahih Muslim (19:4294)](https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/quran/muslim/019-smt.htm#019.4294)\u00a0\\-\u00a0*\"Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy war... When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withhold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them... If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah's help and fight them.\"*\n\n[Tabari 9:69](https://www.kalamullah.com/tabari.html)\u00a0*\"Killing Unbelievers is a small matter to us\"*\u00a0The words of Muhammad, prophet of Islam.\n\n[Quran (3:151)](https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/quran/noble/sura3.html#151)\u00a0\\-\u00a0*\"Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority\".*\u00a0This speaks directly of polytheists, yet it also includes Christians, since they believe in the Trinity (ie. what Muhammad incorrectly believed to be 'joining companions to Allah').\u00a0\n\n[Quran (4:74)](https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/quran/noble/sura4.html#74)\u00a0\\-\u00a0*\"Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward.\"*\u00a0The martyrs of Islam are unlike the early Christians, who were led meekly to the slaughter. These Muslims are killed in battle as they attempt to inflict death and destruction for the cause of Allah. This is the theological basis for today's suicide bombers.\n\n[Quran (5:33)](https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/quran/noble/sura5.html#33)\u00a0\\-\u00a0*\"The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement\"*\u00a0\n\n[Quran (8:12)](https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/quran/noble/sura8.html#12)\u00a0\\-\u00a0*\"(Remember) when your Lord inspired the angels... \"I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them\"*\u00a0No reasonable person would interpret this to mean a spiritual struggle, given that it both followed and preceded confrontations in which non-Muslims were killed by Muslims.\u00a0 The targets of violence are \"*those who disbelieve*\" - further defined in the next verse (13) as those who \"*defy and disobey Allah*.\"\u00a0\n\nthere's like a hundred more of these",

If it interests you, then get a copy and read it and make your own judgement.\n\n12:101 - Joseph: \u201cMy Lord! You have surely granted me authority and taught me the interpretation of dreams. \u02f9O\u02fa Originator of the heavens and the earth! You are my Guardian in this world and the Hereafter. Allow me to die as one who submits\u00a0and join me with the righteous.\u201d\n\n12: 102 - That is from the stories of the unseen which We reveal to you \u02f9O Prophet\u02fa. You were not present when they \u02f9all\u02fa\u00a0made up their minds, and when they plotted \u02f9against Joseph\u02fa.\n\n12: 103 - And most people will not believe\u2014no matter how keen you are\u2014\n\n12: 104 - even though you are not asking them for a reward for this \u02f9Quran\u02fa. It is only a reminder to the whole world.\n\n12: 105 - How many signs in the heavens and the earth do they pass by with indifference!\n\n12: 106 - And most of them do not believe in God without associating others with Him \u02f9in worship\u02fa.\n\n12: 107 - Do they feel secure that an overwhelming torment from God will not overtake them, or that the Hour will not take them by surprise when they least expect \u02f9it\u02fa?\n\n12: 108 - Say, \u02f9O Prophet,\u02fa \u201cThis is my way. I invite to God with insight\u2014I and those who follow me. Glory be to God, and I am not one of the polytheists.\u201d\n\n12: 109 - We only sent before you \u02f9O Prophet\u02fa men inspired by Us from among the people of each society. Have the deniers not travelled through the land to see what was the end of those \u02f9destroyed\u02fa before them? And surely the \u02f9eternal\u02fa Home of the Hereafter is far better for those mindful \u02f9of God\u02fa. Will you not then understand?\n\n12: 110 - And when the messengers despaired and their people thought the messengers had been denied help, Our help came to them \u02f9at last\u02fa. We then saved whoever We willed, and Our punishment is never averted from the wicked people.\n\n12: 111 - In their stories there is truly a lesson for people of reason. This message cannot be a fabrication, rather \u02f9it is\u02fa a confirmation of previous revelations, a detailed explanation of all things, a guide, and a mercy for people of faith.",

They manipulate those who do not read or do not understand Arabic, feeding them a distorted version of Islam that serves their personal, political, or ideological goals.\n\nThe Quran itself contains clear messages of peace, respect, and religious freedom:\n* \u201eThere is no compulsion in religion\u201d (Quran 2:256) \u2013 Islam does not allow forced conversions.\n* \u201eWhoever kills a soul\u2026it is as if he had slain mankind entirely\u201d (Quran 5:32) \u2013 Killing innocent people is a major sin.\n* \u201eAnd do not argue with the People of the Book except in a way that is best\u201d (Quran 29:46) \u2013 Muslims are instructed to engage with other religions peacefully.\n\nYet, many so-called \u201cimams\u201d ignore these teachings. They selectively quote verses out of context to incite hatred, promote violence, or justify oppression. Their audiences, often lacking proper religious education, take these words as absolute truth, never questioning their legitimacy.\n\nThis is not just an issue of theology\u2014it\u2019s a problem of power, control, and ignorance. Those who spread violence in the name of Islam often do so not because of faith, but because of a corrupt interpretation of it, given to them by people who exploit religion for their own benefit.\n\nIf more Muslims read and understood the Quran themselves, rather than relying on biased and politically motivated preachers, much of this radicalization would lose its grip. The real battle is not between Islam and the West\u2014it\u2019s between true Islam and those who twist it for their own agenda.",

That\u2019s something that has been twisted in the endless maelstrom of power struggles between all the factions/clans ever since.\n\nWhat\u2019s sad is, today we\u2019re living in a world with mostly Sunni/Shiia Muslims who seemingly follow the more dominating version of Islam. \n\nBut there are many Muslim groups today that are basically never heard about but focus a LOT more on peace.\n\nLike the Sufi or Ahmadiyya and even the Ibadi groups.\n\nIslam, like Christianity, is splintered. Some groups follow one way of thinking and others follow another and just because they have the same pinnacle of god doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the same in practice.\n\nI\u2019m Catholic and travelled a good bit and Muslims (of all sects although less so Sunni/Shiia from personal experience) are some of the most welcoming people I\u2019ve ever met. Especially in places like Oman.\n\n\nNote: I\u2019m not justifying the original foundation of the religion. It was steeped in war and conflict and just lack of seeing other humans as human.
