Nazi Germany(I\u2019m not saying the US government are nazis, just drawing a parallel) were ultra nationalist. I\u2019m sure a lot of its soldiers were incredibly patriotic. Still happened. Current day Russia surely has a lot of patriotic soldiers in its army. Still happened.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue of \u201cprivate citizens owning guns to fight tyranny\u201d as there\u2019s no fight. History shows that time and time again, people won\u2019t fight until it\u2019s them on the chopping block, and by that point it\u2019s too late. You can have 100 million people with guns willing to fight, but if they\u2019re split up and dealt with over time, all of the sudden, there was no fight to begin with. You guys aren\u2019t France. You\u2019re Germany. (Again, not that I ever think it\u2019ll reach that point, but don\u2019t act like \u201cit can\u2019t happen here\u201d, because it absolutely can. It can happen anywhere.)",

How about the massive trade war he is raging on allies for absolutely no reason? Declaring a state of emergency to tariff what has historically been the best friend of the USA? Threats to annex several allies? This is the president of the United States. Not some random guy saying these things. \n\nTrump is not using DOGE to fight corruption lmao. While I agree with some of what DOGE is doing(mainly the DEI stuff), cutting funding to Social Security, Education and USAID is insanity, and should absolutely 100% not be close to Elon Musk at all. Acting like it\u2019s anything but a way for him to make money and Target the IRS is also insanity. He is a billionaire who is now advising the president for some reason, and using that position to further himself.\n\nAs for the illegal immigrant stuff, sure. I agree with that. But having read into the stuff with the Khalil guy, he\u2019s actively suppressing your freedom of speech now. Reading online, it looks like Khalil has permanent residency in the USA, so silencing him like that is absolutely in breech of several of his human rights as declared by the UN. Furthermore, under his administration, the USA has been put onto a civic rights watchlist due to, you guessed it, threats to your civic freedoms as a citizen, the usage of his power to \u201cunravel democratic institutions, rule of law and global cooperation\u201d. \n\nSo do I think if he tried a \u201cHitler-esque style takeover that there wouldn\u2019t be an uprising?\u201d No, I don\u2019t think there\u2019d be an uprising, because you guys are, in the grand scheme of things, teetering on the edge of a \u201chitler-esque style takeover\u201d. It took Hitler ONE YEAR to gain complete control of Germany. First step of that was his obtainment and use of emergency powers. Something your boy Donny has shown SEVERAL times he is willing and able to do to expand his own power. You\u2019re already past step one and working on a few other of the big events that allowed Hitler to do what he did. You know what the last big step was? The Nazi\u2019s infiltrating, and controlling every major aspect of government. Does that sound familiar?\n\nAgain, do I think an actual full tilt authoritarian government will happen in the USA anytime soon? No. Do I think this shit is cutting it *really* close? Absolutely, and acting like it\u2019s not is the very reason these swathes of people you describe won\u2019t do anything about it. It\u2019s never close, until there\u2019s no one left to say anything.",

Everyone else who lost in those elections was gonna be against him, but the other far right psycho, which put the russian ass licking team at a total of 38%, at best. If we dont count for this huge threat making more people come to vote, that hadnt done it in the first round. \n\nSecond, as i already replied above to your fellow bot farm colleague, it's BECAUSE the democracy here still works that the highest court in the country was able to decide the russian puppet broke the rules in multiple ways and the elections had to be anuled and retaken! And further investigations proved way more ties with the kremlin, therefore he is forever banned from running for anything in this country! Hopefully they have enough evidence to put him in jail, with everyone who helped him get that far!

That is true of many countries, unfortunately.\n\nBut things like voter suppression, or systemic issues such as gerrymandering have been less problematic here than in many places.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that Australia certainly didn't score 'perfectly' on this measure, nor should we.

The only country in the world that would like for Ukraine to fall is Russia. And that's for Putin's own historic designs. \n\nTrump's decision to treat the Ukrainain president like a child, scolding him awkwardly weakens Zelensky's global position, and pulling funding puts Ukraine directly in Russia's hands. There is no reason for Trump to take this strategy other than to 1) Peacock, and/or 2) Pop Ukraine's tires - a move that Putin would cheer like nothing else. Why else would Trump want to take down Zelensky? A personal hatred for Ukraine? I'm struggling to find another reason for his actions short of an agreement with Putin. \n\nI'm not screeching about Trump - I'm just stating facts since it sounds like you might be confused about what's actually happening.",

Decided to go the other direction and support Russia. Ukraine could have gone that route as well - and probably would have been easier for them.\n\n*\\* Actively supports European and American military stations in their borders for two decades,*\n\nThe military stations were not intended to defend Ukraine, they were to permit military assets on the edge of Russia. Ukraine didn't get anything out of it. Well, other than the our having a quick and easy way to defend Ukraine once they were attacked. But no one believed that a land war was even in the cards until it happened.\n\n*\\*\u00a0Permitting the flying of drones and spy planes into and through their sovereign air space, putting themselves at extreme risk,*\n\nSame as above. Ukraine put itself in grave danger by permitting Western countries to use their air space to spy on Russia. The several times that I can recall where drones were downed in Russia, they had just crossed into Russian space from Ukraine. Not great. \n\n*\\* Possesses the vast majority of fossil fuel in Europe and most of Asia, permitting Americans to search and produce fuel, buying it at at a steep discount (BTW: This is why Russia is attacking - they want the fuel and access to the Black Sea)*\n\nSelling fossil fuels to Europe and US at below market rates. Should be self explanatory. Let me know if you need further clarity.\n\n*\\* Has been requesting to join NATO since the fall of the Soviet Union*  \n*\\* Has been prepping documentation for EU status admission for over 15 years*\n\nUkraine's pushing HARD for these groups has definitely pissed off Russia, but Ukraine is decidedly pro West, which, I can't tell you, has been a God send for the West in a very difficult Eastern Europe.  In many ways, it would be easier for Ukraine to follow Belarus. They certainly wouldn't be fighting a war right now.  Ukraine has take risk after risk and hit after hit in support of the West.\n\nLooking at all the pieces on the board, the decision is pretty clear to continue defending this incredible little country that could. They continue to hold the line for the West, and at that against one of only two enemies the US has in the world. It feels like fall-on-the-floor obvious. And defending Ukraine does not preclude conversations with Russia.  International Relations 101.",

We have a hunger index already, peruse it at your leisure. \n\nFundamentally, you fail to understand that there are conditions that make up a democratic state of which India fulfilles (mostly) and the autocratic socialist shitholes you admire do not. \n\nIf you're upset with Modi's primeministership I suggest you engage in the democratic process which India so exemplifies and make a case for his removal from the position in 2029 when elections are held. Until then accept you do not hold views in accordance with the majority of Indian society who diligently partook in the democratic process in 2024 to hand Modi a plurality in parliament. \n\n>I would bet you were put through English medium schools one after the other.\n\nI would prefer to type this in pure Vedic Sanskrit but unfortunately that would lead to more undue judgements from people of your political inclination and temperament.",

For them, they do have the power to fund a political party that gets them what they want, ie, change the parliament which would give them their raw materials, suppress their workers, steal from another country etc; ie being able to change the regime.\n\nEven if you had far more MPs, only people with money get elected, and hence only the rich and their interests will be represented in the parliament.\n\nMillions die from hunger, malnutrition, treatable diseases in India per year, despite there being so much food that we export food; so how can you call this democratic? None of us want this. We all want free or cheap education, healthcare, employment guarantee; in what kind of a \"democracy\" can't people ever get what they all want by any means?\n\nSome of these problems are directly solvable without any large initiative.\n\nOf course, it is stupid to complain; RoI is a republic inherited from British Raj, it will only serve the national and international bourgeoisie, we cannot expect it to work in the interests of the working class. But when you exclude 80-85% of the population from your democracy, then it really just is a plutocracy.",

Instead, the findings show Russian state actors and affiliates had a strategic interest in the convoy and reveal a pattern of activity that is characteristic of Russian influence campaigns.\n\nLiterally nowhere in that piece was the claim that Russia was behind the protests made. Please stop outright lying to people.\n\nAlso, a federal judge ruled the use of the war measures act (emergencies act) unconstitutional and the head of the RCMP said it wasn't needed which makes the Liberal government's use of the act a blatant abuse of government powers and is in fact more authoritarian than anything Harper ever did while he was in power.",

It is a separate branch of government for the express purpose as acting as a power check against the PM. Our system worked how it was supposed to.\n\nHarper literally centralized power of the PMO. Centralization of power *is* authoritarian as it's laying all the power at the feet of a singular person. Ministers had to speak to the PMO before speaking publically. This silenced indepedent voices in the party.\n\nHarper also muzzled scientists, and civil servants. Anything about climate change and enviornmental issues were heavily restricted, and research findings were sometimes blocked from publication or removed from government websites.\n\nHarper prorogued parliament multiple times to avoid accountability.\n\n1. 2008 - to avoid a non-confidence vote after he introduced an economic update that suspended public sector workers' right to strike. planned to end public funding of political parties (which would've crippled opposition parties), and failed to include a significant economic stimulus despite the 2008 finacial crisis. This \n2. 2009 - prorogued to dodge the Afghan Detainee scandal. Canadian troops in afghanistan had tranferred prisoners to afghan authorities who then tortured those people. The government had suppressed information about this to avoid embarrassment. MPs were calling for a public inquiry and release of the documents related. There was also the threat of another non-confidence vote.\n3. 2013 - prorogued to reset Political agenda. Harper was currently dealing with the Senate expenses scandal, where several conservative appointed senators were accused of misuing taxpayer funds. Harper\u2019s former chief of staff, Nigel Wright, had paid $90,000 of Duffy\u2019s expenses in secret--raising questions about Harper's direct involvement and potential cover-up.\n\nCompare that to Trudeau who prorogued parliament so that his party could just... elect a new leader. He wasn't avoiding accountability or denying the democratic process. He was resigning, and wasn't going to run in the next election. He couldn't leave us without a PM or his party without a leader.\n\nCharities critical of Harper were hit with tax audits to tie them up in bureaucratic red tape. the CRA also disproportionately target left-leaning and enviornmental orgs for audits.\n\nHarper undermined press freedom. Reporters had to send in questions ahead of time, press conferences were rare and when they did happen Harper took minimal or no questions. Journalists were often denied direct access to gov data and officials. And once again, ministers had to run interviews and talking points by the PMO first.\n\nBill C-51. The \"Anti-Terrorism Act\" passed in 2015. Massively increased the gov's surveillence powers. Gave CSIS the power to disrupt *percieved* threats instead of just moniter them. Lowered the threshold for arresting people on the suspicion of terrorism. Allowed more information sharing between gov agencies without proper oversight.\n\nThe Fair Elections Act passed in 2014 is often seen as voter suppression. Restricted Elections Canada to encourage voter turnout. Tightened voter ID requirements, which disproportionally affected indigenious people, students, and low income voters. It even prevented Elections Canada from investigating certain types of election fraud.\n\nThere's so much more too. Harper was more authoritarian than Trudeau ever was. Harper would've cracked down on the convoy protest way faster--especially if it was originating from a left-winged cause or enviornmental issues.",

Then they just quietly did it anyways. \n\nThese last four years - you seen the last administration squash free speech, start using words like disinformation and misinformation.  The government also weaponized different branches to come after people that they did not agree with.\n\nIf I compare your current administration and your last administration to see which one would be more fitting to coincide with the book 1984.

However I ask for quantification of what \"full democracy\" entails.\n\nWhat exactly is it which the internet artist and the source of opinion for this \"cool guide\" believes is different about Canada's democratic system versus others that are less than a full democracy?\n\nCurrently, Canada has a Prime Minister who has never participated in an election.\n\nWhile Canada has had a few interim Prime Ministers in the past when a PM has stepped down, never before has that person not already been an elected official (Member of Parliament).\n\nThe Prime Minister at this moment has never ever participated in, nor won any election.\n\nEven outside of that fact, the Canadian Government has and does engage in propaganda, and very often the party in power will abuse process to stay in power. It is not limited to one party but the most recent example is the former PM Trudeau shutting down cabinet in order to avoid any possibility of a non-confidence vote that would force an election.  The specific reasons employed to accomplish this have never been done before and this was very much a unique use of the function in order to hold onto power for the Political Party so that the Party could re-brand themselves and perform a PR-wash.\n\nRegardless of one's political stripes, surely this has to be admitted to qualify as at least a little less than a \"full democracy\". And it is but one example.",

Here is the definition \u201cAccording to Merriam-Webster, \u201ctotalitarian\u201d refers to a political system where the government has complete control over the people, and \u201ctotalitarianism\u201d is the political concept that citizens should be totally subject to an absolute state authority\u201d\n\nI now believe that you are confusing government administration concepts with dictatorships. Which ultimately seems to be the common goal with these \u201ccharts\u201d and \u201cmaps\u201d looking to generate an \u201cevil\u201d point of view of states that are not aligned. \n\nChina\u2019s Xi Jinping probably has as much support from its population as the UK monarchy. But in the end they both are totalitarian schemes of power. \n\nOne would have to look into the concepts the authors of the maps created to understand how they have chosen to make the selection. But for me, any population that does not directly elect their representatives, no matter how ornamental these positions are, is not a real democracy. Most of them only have a majority rule system for decision making that came from a totalitarian form of ruler, and this is confused with democracy; in which the flow of power is the other way around.",

But I'd suggest that electing a representative, and having that representative make decisions on your behalf is indeed democratic.  That is what the Executive branch of the US government does, after all.\n\nI don't see the party selection of a leader as undemocratic.  Sure, it runs contrary to direct democracy, but direct democracy is an ideal rather than practical in any large sense, and no democracies, be it Canadian, Australian or American move away from representative democracies to direct democracies.\n\nSure, US citizens elect the President as well as their local member.  But that President is also allowed to make unilateral decisions without reference to Parliament that seem positively undemocratic to many of us outside the US.\n\nEqually, term limits are something you can fall either side on, but in and of themselves they don't speak to how democratic a country is.  Rather, they are a guardrail which can protect democracy in certain instances.\n\nSince it is not a directly elected position, the whole concept of term limits is a little divorced from how our system works.

I\u2019m under the assumption you assumed I was knocking indirect democracies, while I was just using the shortest version that reflects the same meaning. It\u2019s literally in the definition on Wikipedia. I define the type for the distinction since there\u2019s multiple forms of indirect democracies.\u00a0\n\nEvery scholar on the subject has defined the number 1 problem with representative democracies is they slide into oligarchies. Known as the \u201ciron law of oligarchy\u201d. There are commonly 2 key elements that lead to this. The restricting of free speech & removing the right to defend themselves with weapons. Every western parliament nation is undergoing this change currently.\u00a0\n\nThis was something I researched during the war in Ukraine. I was confused why \u201callied\u201d nations were powering down nuclear power plants in the name of \u201cclean energy\u201d, while simultaneously powering on coal plants & other forms of fossil fuel plants. Giving more money to Russia, than aid to Ukraine. There was no scenario where coal plants made more sense than nuclear for reducing CO2 emissions. Unless the main goal was to undermine the Biden administration\u2019s plan on drying up funds for the Russian war machine.\u00a0\n\nHaven\u2019t looked into Australia, since I didn\u2019t see them doing this. Glad you guys at least have a say in your senators unlike some democracies. The US is also under attack. The Executive branch was drastically increased under T.R. & FDR. That\u2019s when we truly transitioned from a constitutional republic, to a legislative democracy. Something that can hopefully be undone.\u00a0\n\nTo have any country ranked at full democracy is laughable. The fact that it was countries where citizens have less say in the ruling class seemed ironic & worth commenting upon.\u00a0",
