All should be used at night time and it's important users use SPF.\n\n\nPHA is like an AHA but weaker, due to larger particle size so again wouldn't use them together and would recommend a PHA to someone that finds AHAs too strong.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd some people avoid mixing AHAs with Azelaic Acid, as they find it irritating, but they can be complementary.\u00a0\n\n\nLikewise some people avoid mixing BHAs (salicylic acid) with AHA, but they work differently, AHA is water soluble, BHA oil soluble.\u00a0",
