    "selftext": "The head moderator of the subreddit LiveStreamFail Stale2000, has once again removed a majority of the LSF mod team - this time for confronting him for not removing a powermod who he randomly added months ago when stale needed support when the prior mods brought up issues about stale\u00a0 - that mod is on the mod council, actively moderates over 200+ subreddits, and was found to be into underage problematic content. This current group of mods who were removed were chosen by Stale along with two leftover mods from the original team that he purged most of in 2024. After only a couple of months, this new mod team began noticing the same issues the last team had with Stale.\u00a0 The team grew frustrated that he actively promoted content he was in favor of while removing any content that saw fit in the moment. When confronted he ignored criticism and kicked a member of the team who brought it up at the time.\u00a0\n\nMembers of the team found evidence that the powermod was openly viewing, favoriting, and active in multiple communities that promoted problematic content about minors and other associated media.\n\nConversation with powermod admitting the accounts associated with the problem content was his:  \n[https://imgur.com/a/slsXism](https://imgur.com/a/slsXism)\u00a0\n\nMuch of which is sexually suggestive art involving minors, with tags such as #preteen and #12yo.\u00a0\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/4EfLiKQ](https://imgur.com/a/4EfLiKQ)\n\nIn addition to threatening to 86 other mods and trying to sabotage other mods, by attempting to take over subreddits behind their back.\u00a0 Not to mention the powermod\u2019s antisemitism and use of anti-LGBTQ insults.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/AUovsU3](https://imgur.com/a/AUovsU3)\n\nWhen this was brought up to Stale, he didn\u2019t think it was egregious enough to remove the powermod. Later, he stated that he didn\u2019t remove the powermod because he was afraid of losing his position as top mod. Stale refused to even discuss it with the powermod, or take any actions at all. The only action done during this time by Stale was to add 3 alt accounts of his to the 2,3 and 4th spot on the modlist.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/fGrjbia](https://imgur.com/a/fGrjbia)\n\nComplete conversation with Stale about the powermod:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/I9nm03o](https://imgur.com/a/I9nm03o)\n\nDue to Stale\u2019s inaction we went to the powermod directly who admitted that everything we found was indeed his and that he saw no issues with it and that he was \"just a weeb\". After making it clear that we did not want him on the team due to what we found, the powermod voluntarily left.\u00a0 Stale made sure to give him some kind words on his way out:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/7zWmQxB](https://imgur.com/a/7zWmQxB)\u00a0\n\nReddit was informed about the situation but did nothing due to it being off platform. Stale was aware of this for a week before members of the team were forced to act on the team\u2019s behalf and ask for the powermod to step down. Obviously upset about the situation, many of the mods once again expressed their concerns to Stale. Stale continued to claim that he did not remove the powermod because he was worried about making Reddit admin\u2019s angry. A week later he removed all but three moderators because they expressed concerns with how Stale handled the situation.\n\nWe thought it was important to get this information out there as LSF affects a lot of streamers careers and can have a life changing effect in countless different ways. We didn\u2019t want LSF to turn into an echo chamber based on one moderator's wishes who happened to get control of the top mod position and is now holding it hostage. Two groups of moderators completely separate from each other have both independently found the same issues and come to the same conclusion that Stale is unfit to run the largest streaming-focused subreddit and unless some sort of action is taken the same set of circumstances will play out over and over again.\u00a0\n\nTLDR: Top LSF mod treats subreddit like his own personal playground, protects powermods who openly views underage suggestive media, then purges mod team for confronting him.\u00a0\n\nThis is just a portion of what proof we have. There is quite a bit more, but due to the nature of the content it\u2019s not appropriate to post.",
