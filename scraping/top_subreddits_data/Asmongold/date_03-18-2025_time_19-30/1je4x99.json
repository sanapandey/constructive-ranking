And people don't have to hide it.\n\n  \nThe other side would say it's because we've allowed radicals in the space indoctrinate children.\n\n  \nI'm sure it's a combination of both.  If you can make a child atheist or religious through upbringing it seems pretty easy to say you can make them want to change their sex.\n\n  \nKids are pretty na\u00efve and malleable to be honest, they can be convinced of anything if the adults around them reinforce it enough.  Take Santa and the Easter Bunny.  The Tooth fairy for example.\n\n  \nBut the first part is also true, because in the past persons of the trans community and even just gay and lesbian persons have been treated poorly and violently.  These people have a right to exist, but they don't have the right to push this on anyone else's children through the public school system for example.  Much like religions don't have the right to push their beliefs onto other children through the school system.",

The last 5 years or so society was accepting and pushing trans inclusion in schools and such.  I had a high school ages Son during this time.  And I told him, that's just how the world works here now pal.  You might think it's dumb, you may not like it.  But that's just how it is.  \n\n  \nAnd I think this is an easier pill for men to swallow because honestly if I walked into a restroom and a woman was in there using the bathroom, which by the way I have had happen, I'd just ignore them, and use a stall instead of urinal that time.  Not because I was afraid or whatever, but because I'd assume she likely wouldn't want to see me piss.\n\n  \nThe issue arises mostly from men using the women's restrooms or locker rooms.  As typically it's men that physically assault women, sure there are fringe cases and exceptions, but that's just the truth of the matter.  Women's spaces were created to protect women from men, to the best of my knowledge.  And if that's not the case, it has turned into the case recently enough as to not matter what the original reason for it was.\n\n  \nSo yeah, I would conform to whatever society enforced as the laws of society.  Are their outliers I wouldn't conform to?  Maybe, but bathroom usage isn't one of them.  My preference though is to split men from women, based on biological differences.  If you have a vajayjay be over there, if you have a weewee be over there.\n\n  \nBut maybe I'm a transphobe, so who knows?",

It shows them acting obtuse and playing stupid when any reasonable person would have understood the implications of what she was saying by \"parts\", the insistence of a written policy further highlights their immaturity and it's painfully obvious to the normal person that they are antagonistic. \n\nEvery retail worker's nightmare are the POS's behind the camera in this video. These are the same people to call your bluff when you say you are going to have them trespassed because they are under the impression that no minimum wage worker has the ability to trespass and get upset when it actually happens.",
