Marriage is a societal solution to some large problems - producing the next generation to a good standard, reducing male violence by distributing women, and some other stuff.\n\nGay marriage does not do much of this (the distributing women part not so much a problem in your case...).  On the individual level of course it has a large impact on those peoples lives, but not on a societal level where it was designed for.\n\n> Im not allowed under current law to adopt children.\n\nI was on your side for this until I saw the utter insanity from far too many examples of \"lgbtqmnop\" parents.  Children deserve to be brought up in what is normal for the society for the best chance at a happy life.  No, heterosexual people aren't all normal either but it's a reasonable requirement to help in that regard especiallly given the evidence.\n\n> I couldn't visit my partner in a hospital the same way a straight cople could.\n\nThis shit needs to change and where a \"civil union\" deal would fix the problems imo.  No its not marriage, yes it would allow for a lot of the non-societally oriented things such as this.  Depending on country there's a number of them like shared bank accounts, wills, next of kin etc.\n\n---\n\nMany changes in the west over the last 50 years have had a crippling effect on our societies.  Even if it means some small treading on individual liberties for a short while, we need to correct course or we're on the way to civilizational suicide.  Related, marriage should also be taken much more seriously with it being harder to annul.",

Death, torture, violence, dehumanization,  ostracization... It's difficult to put into few words the full range of horrors LGBT people went and still are going through. \n\nTaking all that into account, it's perfectly logical that LGBT people would start to fight back against that when the right moment occurred.  Which was in the 60s. At least globally speaking. Pride is just one result of that fight.\n\nThe reason straight people don't have pride parades isn't because \"it's just who straight people are\" it's because straight people never had a remotely similar experience and reason as LGBT people did. Not only historically, but even currently on a day to day basis. It takes a conscious effort for straight people to even try to understand the LGBT experience and the hardships that come with it because, like I said, they never experience those kinds of hardships and discrimination. If straight people had any real need or want for Straight Pride, it would have been held in every country in the world a long time ago. \n\nNow, is it better today than it was before? Yes. Not everywhere, but generally: yes, definitely. Which doesn't mean that it's equal or that there isn't a long way to go still. And whether or not it's equal is not something that straight people can decide on since... well, that's not the experience they're having and can judge.\n\nAnother thing to consider with Pride is that it is also a cultural thing. A symbol. A holiday of sorts. And how would you feel if someone would ban an event that you hold dear and that is important to you and your culture? And while we are talking about sexuality, a subculture has grown out of the shared experiences of the people of that sexuality.\n\nAnd let's be completely honest: for all the (un)deserved criticism of Pride, Pride is not what's holding back the acceptance of the LGBT community. If LGBT people all over the world suddenly decided to stop holding Pride parades this instance, nothing would change. Things wouldn't get better not even a little bit. So, the issue isn't Pride, but something else.",

I really dont see the problem in banning the promotion of homosexuality to children, its not like its banning people from being gay, talking about being gay or even promoting it to other adults who are old enough to decide for themselves. \n\nThere is however a difference between promoting and educating. And i think people should be taught about different people existing from an objective point, without promoting being like them. Pride celebrations do not do that, so i dont see why they cant stay in the privacy of people's homes and away from children.",

Also parents shouldnt be forced to keep their children inside any day because they want to avvoid this. the public should be public and open for anyone to go about their day normally.\n\nit may not bother you, but it bothers allot of people that this may influence young minds, just like porn may, but that does not mean i want to ban either one of those for adults or think that their existence is wrong in any way. if you as an adult want to celebrate pride in your own home or in a private party, then good for you, this law does not ban that.",

It wasn't even a week ago when he literally called EVERYONE who opposes him a cockroach (he used another bug in his analogy, but that's the Hungarian equivalent of cockroach).\n\nHe is rapidly losing ground, and he tries EVERYTHING to make every independent media (there aren't many in the country as 90% of it is owned by Fidesz), every opposition a Soros agent. Meanwhile, he stuffs his own, his family's and his friends' pockets with EU fundings that he diverts from actually meaningful projects. He had multiple top-class football stadiums built in the country (one LITERALLY in his home village that has a population of 1000 people) while in the upper two football championships the average attendance is about 4000 viwers. At the same time, several hospitals got closed because the buildings were close to collapsing and medical doctors and skilled nurses left the country due being severely underpaid (even compared to neighboring countries like Slovakia). He made his bloodhound the Home Secretary, and since the teachers, and other school workers revolted against the attrocious state of the education, he simply merged the Secretary of Education under the jurisdiction of the Home Secretary. The Home Secretary is a former police chief, and has zero knowledge of education (also, during the 90s, it was an open secret that as the police chief he was also the head of the oil-smuggling and petrol-falsifying organized crime in the country).\n\nSo no, don't think that this is the fight of a goodwilling man against the decadency of the west. It's the battlecry of a despot who clings to his power when FINALLY after 15 years of rule, a worthy opposition rose that can dethrone him.",

With military especially in combat you need trust. Yes youre not wrong in saying its not fair however trust needs time. Someone whos never been exposed to a gay man or has been raised to distrust/dislike gays will automatically have a problem with said gay man being someone he has to trust with his life. Now with the dont ask dont tell it was something that made it work and ultimately brought men together who would normally not. We're still in a funny spot where being gay is accepted but still looked at as unnatural for a lot of people. Once you build friendship/trust/respect then drop the \"im gay\". Coming straight out of the gate with it instantly raises walls. Obviously its not like it was in the 90s and is a lot more socially accepted now but not there yet. The same can be said about the lgbtq blitzkreig of the last 4yrs. I believe it was waaaaay too much way too fast for people to accept. If they stuck with like 4 pronouns instead of 77  and built it up slowly and didnt try to be so damn entitled about everything it would prolly have gone a lot better. Trans athletes and anything involving kids and hormone blockers/surgeries i dont think will be accepted for a long time tho. As fucked up as it sounds being lgbtq is unnatural. Doesnt mean its wrong but it goes against what a lot of people believe is \"normal\".",

Reading about the history of the movement did change my views on it though. \"Pride\" is and was a protest against overbearing governments. I like this quote about it:\n\n\"At its core, pride is a protest against the criminalization of our identities. It is a refusal to be confined to the shadows, to be denied our humanity, and to be stripped of our rights.\"\n\nStates still had laws targeting homosexuality in the 2000s, and gay marriage wasn't fully legalized until just under 10 years ago. There are people who want to remove the rights of Americans (or Hungarians in this case), and pride is a form of protest against that.\n\n>I think it legitimately encourages people thinking sexuality is this huge thing about a person and your life and it should affect your thinking and generally your life\n\nFor a lot of people it is, but not by choice. When your sexuality would prevent you from having the same rights as the person beside you, it becomes a huge thing about your life.",

The concept of being openly gay is modern phenomena that only started happening around 50 years ago. \n\nWtf are you even talking about, you saying \"gay people need to be normal and they will automatically get rights\" has no basis in historical reality.
