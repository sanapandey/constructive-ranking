In the past like 8 months we've had:\n\n\nCandlelight vigils for Yahya Sinwar(the poster had a picture of him with poppies and said \"lest we forget\" lol...) with the mayor calling him a freedom fighter\u00a0\n\n\nPeople had to beg the mayor to cancel a convention that called for Shariah law and a caliphate in Canada\n\n\nA school played an Arabic fight song during remembrance day(a day to honor our veterans) and nothing else. They then issued that histories too focused on white guys...lol fuck my grandpa I guess\u00a0\n\n\nSoldiers weren't allowed to wear their uniforms during ceremonies because it might trigger immigrants\n\n\nA lecturer at York university yelling fuck you at veterans on remembrance day\u00a0\n\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/DCUhibtJbhu/?img_index=1&igsh=MzA3dGViMnVwZWI1\n\n\nThis is just off the top of my head, add to this corporations prefer hiring temporary foreign workers from India over citizens, it's not uncommon to walk into a business in downtown Toronto and see a 90% Indian staff even though the city is diverse as fuck.",
