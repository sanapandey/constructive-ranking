He said that while he felt all non muslims should convert or die, he didn\u2019t believe they needed to carry out suicide bombings. His reasoning was that the \u201cwest has opened its doors to the wolves in sheeps clothing, and within the next century we will breed them out of existence\u201d Those words were more frightening than bomb threats imo. It is a much more successful strategy",

With a quick Google the estimate for \"honour killings\" is around 12 a year.  A similar Google shows 42 toilet related child deaths.

Again from a quick Google the number of domestic abuse deaths involving white people was in the hundreds. Again I'm not saying you are wrong to be angry at any of it but to pick the one you have over others has to have something to do with the people doing it and not the crime itself.",

The Boriswave was like 2 million people in 2 years. Boris and Sunak absolutely ratfucked us.\n\nI feel fucking bad for Labour because they are just fucked. The devastation of the tory immigration policies is nuts. There is zero chance they can fix it before the next election.\n\nThe other thing fucking us is disability stuff. People claiming money and cars because they have \"adhd\" etc. Governments on the news trying to cut it today and everyone is screaming like the government is trying to kill them. We have millions of people living in this country who are emotionally invested in having everyone else pay for them to live. \n\nThere was a guy complaining about the government cutting PIP in one of the threads a few days ago, looked at his post history, free car from the government which he took racing around the scotish highlands and the rest of the money he spend on a full F1 racing sim rig and like 20 collectable edition lego car models. And this guy was acting as if the government has no heart because they say they can't afford that sort of thing.\n\nThe guy has genuine mobility issues and I really feel for him, and I'll happily pay taxes for the government to help people like him live a normal life. But I don't remember signing up to pay for someone to race around scotland or funding their lego addiction. And every penny spent on stuff like that is money not spent in situations where someone really needs it.",

Switzerland only allows it's citizens to bank in the country so unless you're born there can't use that. All you would need is a politician and a following that backs the idea of taxing I mean why not seize the entire 200 billion since technically the money doesn't belong to anyone what are they gonna do? Most other countries are starting to make you disclose who the real owners are anyway so the world is starting to go after them.

To go back to the original subject of this post, a lot of non-whites in London have been there for generations, the house I rented in Finchley when I lived in London was from an Indian landlord who was born there same as his father, it was his grandfather who came to the UK in the 40's.\n20 years ago it had roughly the same composition racially but now it's a problem because trump said it ...",

You're wrong again or just being dishonest - most countries, especially outside of the western world - protect their traditions and cultures. That's partly why we have different countries with different borders and different cultures and traditions. It's not about keeping a populace \"pure\", it's about preserving the populace's cultures, traditions, and way of life. One more, I'll state again: the migrants also hold this viewpoints and would not allow a large foreign populace to enter their home countries to put reproduce their native population. If natives are replaced then those cease to exist and in current scenario will be entirely replaced with the winning populace. \n\nIt's pretty simple logic to understand: if the Brits have a reproduction rate of .9 and migrants have a reproduction rate of 2.4, what do you think will happen? The British culture will be replaced. This isn't an innocent \"sharing of ideas and cultures\", lol, how dishonest and ignorant.\n\nEdit: one more point, again you're being dishonest or you're incredibly ignorant / super narrow world view: most countries in the world have strict immigration policies with distinct traditions, cultures, and peoples.",

Blindly following. on a long enough time scale the life of everything goes to 0. So if you don't have an influx of population then a tribe would die. New people means that old customs and new customs are shared and exchanged. It's only through this western culture that has financially segregated everyone into their echo chambers. Also here is a thought for you in 100 yrs when everyone you know is dead You Are Already Going To Be Replaced. That's what time does. The fact that you use British culture as an example proves you know nothing about history or culture. British culture is a made up word it comes from when Celts , Danish and Anglo Saxons all invaded the island so where do you even get this idea of British culture the island has been invaded hundreds of times n each time the culture changed. Did you know the original Celts had chariots similar to ancient Egypt so isn't that proof that ideas and cultures can be exchanged. I also shouldn't have to mention sometimes these culture changes happen at the sword point as the Germans that destroyed Rome if that didn't change things. Fundamentally history has been people coming together sharing ideas to face the problems sometimes they did so peacefully the  impact of Buddhaism is just one example a religion originally in India now dominants all of Asia and many parts of the world. So just because you don't know how to research doesn't mean the information isn't out there.",

Most rational people don't want their country, economy, politics, traditions, etc.. suddenly overrun and replaced. \n\nWhat's happening in Europe isn't some natural evolution of people sharing ideas and cultures, you again keep trying to frame it that way.",

Not a power that he has. You literally don't know anything. Obviously because you are still granted due process in America under the Constitution. It's in the Bill of Rights.",

Then few moron came up with idea that some verses sent to 6th century which were all about fighting against pagans during that era is practicable in modern era too because they hate west and they need excuse to be barbarian. Because just like Asmon said, some cultures are really inferior especially in 21st century. Those people need education but they refuse it. Educated muslims becomes the SECULARs who understands that in modern society you cannot practice sharia which is nothing but lunacy, especially if person reads quran with modern mindset, including other religious books, it is simple: Be a good person, help poor, believe in god .. etc If a lunatic reads , focuses on the specific era , he can easily ignore the biggest fact of the all religions : BE A GODDAMN GOOD PERSON, NO KILLING , NO VIOLENCE , GOD IS WATCHING.   \nAnd we are lucky that we had a historical person like Ataturk who turned country in the secular. we could end up just like them. \n\nanyway, your stupid government especially in US(democrats) let many lunatics to walk in, there are probably got sleeping ISIS cells and Taliban cells waiting for the right moment.

It's actually crazy how much it has grown in the last few years.

Though that's mostly because of the immigrant laws being retarded and protecting the immigrants doing crime. A couple of months ago there was an article on the news that the police was looking for a fugitive, but they censored his face, and gave no name lol.. Granted, they always censor the face and name when it comes to crimes going on, which is just insane imo. Almost every day there's a new article about a murder by stabbing, or mugging on the open streets. Even just 10 years ago it wasn't this bad. \n\n  \nThere's a saying in Norway that we are about 10 years behind Sweden when it comes to crime rate due to immigration. Sweden is 100x worse though so hopefully our government will actually make a change before it's too late.",
