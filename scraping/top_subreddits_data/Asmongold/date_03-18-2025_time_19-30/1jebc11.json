First, the 2nd Amendment wasn\u2019t just about fighting tyranny\u2014it was also about self-defense and deterring government overreach, which is still relevant today. Saying the Founders wouldn\u2019t support it now is pure speculation. If we\u2019re tossing out rights because they were written in the past, should we also ditch the 1st Amendment because they couldn\u2019t predict social media?\n\nThen there's the contradiction\u2014guns are useless against the government, but also such a massive threat that they cause constant violence? You can\u2019t have it both ways. If they\u2019re powerless, why do criminals use them? Why do politicians have armed security? Guns are clearly effective, and taking them away from law-abiding citizens just means criminals have the upper hand.\n\nAnd the \u201cbad guys have easy access to guns\u201d argument? Most gun crimes are committed with illegally obtained firearms. Cities with strict gun laws like Chicago and D.C. still have high crime rates, while places with high legal gun ownership have lower crime. Why? Because criminals think twice when their target might be armed.\n\nAt the end of the day, the issue isn\u2019t legal gun ownership\u2014it\u2019s criminals who don\u2019t follow laws anyway. You don\u2019t stop crime by disarming the people who obey the rules.\n\nI'm blocking your ass, because I can't be bothered with smooth brain leftoids who want to bend over and allow the government to ram it up their sphincters raw.",

Unfortunately, just like those other states the most populated area is deep blue, that being Minneapolis/St. Paul in this case, more commonly known as the twin cities here in MN.  I cannot begin to understand why they vote the way they do, so I won't.  \n\nIlhan Omar is Somalian.  Minnesota has the largest Somali population on the entire planet outside of Somalia itself.  Most of these Somali's live in the twin cities and surrounding areas, all of which now suffer from Somali gangs and the massive spike in crime they brought.  Even much smaller cities, such as St. Cloud and Owatonna have a Somali gang problem.  This, however, is besides the point.\n\nHow does a monster that hates our country, hates white people and commits immigration fraud get elected to the senate?\n\nFucking weird white people, that's how.  It's the same way these weirdos get elected everywhere.  Weird fucking white people that live in urban areas.  Exit city limits and the political map turns bright red.",
