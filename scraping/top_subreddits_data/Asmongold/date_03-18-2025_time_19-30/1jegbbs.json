And the weird false PoE flex didn't help his case any.  I don't trust him.\n\nBut even if he had a sparkling clean record, it's still not a good idea to worship him like a golden calf.  The human tendency to idol worship has historically never ended in a net positive.  It usually ends in some sort of social or political disaster.  Nobody should ever be above scrutiny and criticism.",

I have a paper from a bullshit assignment in college that was basically \u201cwho is close to a modern day super hero?\u201d I wrote about Elon in 2012. I don\u2019t agree with that now. He more closely lines up to a Lex Luther type, consolidating money/power, cozying up to govt. officials to deregulate his own industries, cutting other industries govt. contracts with private he guise of cost cutting, ruining towns near space x facilities in south Texas, promoting free speech but banning the lead singer from Dropkick Murphys for something he did irl instead of on X, etc.\n\nPeople can change for better or worse. I personally think he\u2019s changed for the worse, pulled inward, completely focused on himself and his tight circle. The left liked him at the time because he wasn\u2019t involved in personal benefit politics and focused on EV and space exploration.",

This was an accomplishment by thousands of engineers, standing on the shoulders of decades of work by countless engineers. \n\nJust like Tesla... Just like Starlink... Just like anything decent Elon has ever taken credit for. The guy buys companies that employ great minds... he isn't an ubermench with the thinking power of 10 thousand normal men. He rarely contributes to the hard science... He hasn't invented *anything* personally, as a technical lead, in aerospace... or any other engineering field, really. These are just facts.  \n\nIf Elon Musk managed a company of scientists who cured cancer, on the back of a century of cancer research... I'd celebrate the discovery, but I sure as shit wouldn't be giving all the credit to a venture capitalist...\n\nYou know who was responsible for todays rescue? Mission commander, NASA astronaut Nick Hague - leading a team of consumate professionals at the top of their fields, from a wide diversity of space agencies, and nationalities- using a combined system of spacecrafts, from different generations, ingeniously designed to interface with one-another. It was a goddamn group effort - and I'm tired of the accomplishments of real, hard working heroes, being gobbled up by the billionaire narcissists who are rich enough to pay the media for credit.\n\nAnd yea. If Elon goes into a fucking labratory hermitage, like an old-timey mad scientist, and literally cures cancer with his own deep researched knowledge of oncology- then the world will absolutely celebrate him. He will be considered the greatest mind of a generation, and the hero that saved millions of lives. But thats not going to happen, because thats not how science works in the 21st century.",
