Organisations like the BNP and Nationalist Front (NF) for example. They were often seen as loutish and openly racist, and for the most part they were. \n\nOver the years more mainstream parties have risen and won a few seats here and there like UKIP for example, but they seem to lack enough mainstream appeal to have any real influence. I'm pretty sure UKIP no longer even exists.\n\nWe also had the conservative (mainstream British right wing) in charge for about 14 years prior to the current government, and they often promised to address the immigration issues but their efforts amounted to close to nothing. I know from speaking to my friends at the time that the real driving force behind Brexit for the working class was a desire to take back control of our borders. \n\nThe current UK government seems hell bent on protecting minority groups at the expense of the domestic populations, but they are not very popular with anyone at the minute so I can't imagine them staying in power for long.",

What you're seeing in the UK isn't just a freak thing, it's part of a very deliberate plan that's baked into the religion.  And deceiving Westerners about the goals of the religion is also part of that plan.\n\nBut don't take my world for it, I'm no expert, but I encourage anybody to read the Qu'ran and related material themselves and talk to ex-Muslims for clarity.
