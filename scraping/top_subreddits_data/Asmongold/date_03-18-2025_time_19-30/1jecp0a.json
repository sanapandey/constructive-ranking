So USA know this doctrine because it is since the cold war and yet they push and push! They think that Putin would bluff, but why would he! Also their war doctrine is - No Russia than No World! Why would any sane person test the Russians ? They push and push and push untill Russia reacts and than they start - aggressor, killer , etc. Putin is no saint, he has killed many Russians too, do not get me wrong!\n\nThere is a funny example with the Pearl Harbor incident. If you read the whole story now, one could say that Japan were pushed into attacking Pearl Harbor - it was the same as is today - financial regulation, no oil, no energy, no food for Japan and this forced them to attack!\n\nthe United States imposed severe economic sanctions on Japan before the attack on Pearl Harbor, which played a significant role in escalating tensions.\n\nBy the late 1930s and early 1940s, Japan was expanding aggressively in China and Southeast Asia, aiming to become the dominant power in the Pacific. The U.S. and other Western nations saw this as a threat and took economic and political actions against Japan:\n\nU.S. Trade Embargoes on Japan (1939-1941)\n\nThe U.S. restricted exports of key materials like aviation fuel, scrap metal, and machine tools.\n\nThese were essential for Japan\u2019s military expansion\n\nThe U.S. Freezes Japanese Assets (July 1941)\n\nAfter Japan occupied French Indochina (modern-day Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia) in July 1941, the U.S. froze all Japanese assets in American banks.\n\nThis prevented Japan from accessing funds to buy necessary resources\n\nThe Oil Embargo (August 1941)\n\nThe U.S., Britain, and the Netherlands cut off Japan\u2019s oil supply, which was devastating since Japan imported 80% of its oil from the U.S.\n\nWithout oil, Japan\u2019s military and economy would collapse within months\n\nFailed Diplomatic Negotiations (Mid-1941 - December 1941\n\nJapan saw these sanctions as an attempt to strangle its economy and force it to abandon its expansion in Asia\n\nThe U.S. demanded that Japan withdraw from China and Indochina before lifting sanctions\n\nJapan refused, believing that war was the only way to secure resources.\n\nALSO - USA needed the attack so that they have excuse to join the WW2 conflict.... All is lies and theater for the \"goyum\" and the \"unilluminated\" . Do not believe anything they say to you ...\n\nDo you see the similarities between Japan back than and Russia now ... There is nothing new under the sun\n\nEurope is dead without Russia. Europe can not exist economically without the cheap gas and oil from Russia. Europe has been building this infrastructure for cheap gas from Russia for 25 years now! But the world is at a stage of reshaping. Europe has lost it's part on the stage and now China and other countries are stepping up.\n\nEurope has no resources to either fight or ti produce anything besides food. And even food is hard without Russian chheap pesticides and food growth stimulants produced by the oil industry. Currently Europe is dead financially and economically and the EU is going to disband soon!\n\n\u00a0",
