That will leave mostly women and foreign terrorists in the country. Thus there will be no one to oppose the absolute authority of the government.\n\nIf they fail to start WW3 with Russia, they will continue to work on building hatred toward Islam, in the hopes of starting a West vs Islamic countries world war instead, where again they can do conscription to get most of the young men killed.\n\nThe smart thing is, the people are not hating their government enough, they are hating the terrorists the government is bringing in, but they are blaming the terrorists and not the government for importing them. Thus when a future government suggests a war on terror, people will go for it, when reality what they should be doing is turning against their own governments.",
