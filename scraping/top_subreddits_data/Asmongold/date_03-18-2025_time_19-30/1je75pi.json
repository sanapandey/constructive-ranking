And while I will take the time to stop and encourage them along, it seems others go out of their way to hit them. And either way, no one else seems to care. It's a turtle, a raccoon, a deer, what have you... animals get hit on roads.\n\nNow, my question is, if a person identifies as a turtle, makes that publicly known through all platforms and is hit by a car, should anyone care anymore about that individual than they would an actual turtle?\n\n\"Oh, my goodness, you've hit that woman!\"\n\n\"Nah, it's okay, they use 'turtle' as a identification.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay then...\"",
