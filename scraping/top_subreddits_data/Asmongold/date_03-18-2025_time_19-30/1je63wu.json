Lies by omission are also lies. \n\nFor example under Joe Biden they said two consecutive quarters of GDP reduction isn't a recession. All the main stream media outlets defended this and told everyone it's wrong.\n\nJoe Rogan brought on an economist who said two quarters of GDP reduction is literally the textbook definition of a recession. It's been printed in textbooks for decades. That's literally what I learned in economics, that's my major. \n\nCNN didn't say, that was the textbook definition but this time is special and different. They went with the narrative that it's not the definition at all. Never was. You are dumb for thinking so. \n\nThat's called gaslighting. \n\nWait, didn't CNN literally do the \"mostly peaceful protest\" quote with cars and buildings burning in the background? Not a lie because \"peaceful\" is subjective but they are pissing on you and saying it's raining. That's what they do. It's obnoxious and annoying. \n\nJoe Rogan brings on the crazy UFO guy and everyone knows he's crazy. Joe Rogan doesn't really editorialize or gaslight you. He directs the conversation a little bit but it feels genuine.",

Long before COVID and ivermectin nonsense. \n\nWhat's this CNN info you want now?\n\n\nToday, ivermectin is continuing to surprise and excite scientists, offering more and more promise to help improve global public health by treating a diverse range of diseases, with its unexpected potential as an antibacterial, antiviral and anti-cancer agent being particularly extraordinary.\n\nSince the prodigious drug donation operation began, 1.5 billion treatments have been approved\n\nRecent research has confounded the belief, held for most of the past 40 years, that ivermectin was devoid of any antiviral characteristics. Ivermectin has been found to potently inhibit replication of the yellow fever virus, with EC50 values in the sub-nanomolar range. It also inhibits replication in several other flaviviruses, including dengue, Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis, probably by targeting non-structural 3 helicase activity.97 Ivermectin inhibits dengue viruses and interrupts virus replication, bestowing protection against infection with all distinct virus serotypes, and has unexplored potential as a dengue antiviral.98\n\nIvermectin has also been demonstrated to be a potent broad-spectrum specific inhibitor of importin \u03b1/\u03b2-mediated nuclear transport and demonstrates antiviral activity against several RNA viruses by blocking the nuclear trafficking of viral proteins. It has been shown to have potent antiviral action against HIV-1 and dengue viruses, both of which are dependent on the importin protein superfamily for several key cellular processes. Ivermectin may be of import in disrupting HIV-1 integrase in HIV-1 as well as NS-5 (non-structural protein 5) polymerase in dengue viruses\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/ja201711",

I still maintaim that the sentiment is not completely baseless as it would seem like Ivermectin prior to covid was primarily used as a parasite medicine (and thus its use for covid was surprising).\n\nIf CNN has truly said that ivermectin is just a horse medicine, that is then of course completely false.",

I have an article here from 2003 stating that SARS-COV1 is similar in mode of action to HIV which would indicate similar anti viral treatments. \n\nWould it not then be easy to believe that any doctors who were up on this research would try prescribing ivermectin (as I already shown you this medicine is extremely safe, and widely prescribed) to treat SARS-COV2? Then when it worked don't you think that would spread? Why would it's use for COVID be surprising. I'm not even a doctor, I just stay up to date on medical news and as soon as COVID started to spread I thought \"oh they should try hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin\"\n\nWhy don't you watch the CNN video where they put a filter over joes Instagram video to make him look sickly and then where they said he was taking \"horse dewormer\" which I already proved to you he wasn't.",

However, in the same speech, Trump made it clear \"[I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally](https://youtu.be/nQezreVKzXU?si=h52wvI0zTKOcwEKu&t=119)\" \n\nThis hoax becomes the foundation for all Trump is a racist nationalist for many years to come, it was even still repeated by [Obama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyviE_UNu2w), [Biden ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlCyYvLqHR4)and [Kamala ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZbuciwT6lI)in 2024. Consider its significance and lasting effect, I believe this is undoubtedly their biggest lie. Second biggest lie is probably the drinking bleach hoax",
