But didn\u2019t address the whole point of why she got deported\u2026 \n\nThat\u2019s why when anyone brings up that she supports terrorist organisations and went to a gathering of those terrorists it\u2019s immediate default to \u201cWell Trump is basically worse than Hezbollah anyway\u201d and all these whataboutisms. \n\nAs I said - She has the opportunity to appeal the decision. That\u2019s due process. But like it or not - Citizens of any country live under different rules to those on Visas. You may not like it\u2026 but if you are part of a group or support one that openly hates America and everything it stands for and you are residing in America\u2026 you can\u2019t exactly be surprised when they tell you to leave. \n\nTLDR: Don\u2019t openly support anti western terrorist organisations that openly hates the west, openly wants to get rid of the west, openly hates America and views it as its greatest enemy\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s literally that simple. My comment was more about the fact that people are actively trying to pass over the fact that she supported a terrorist, admitted to it and is trying to frame it as if she is just an innocent doctor who was deported because she is from Lebanon because it serves their political needs. \n\nFunny thing is - I\u2019m not even a lover of Trump either, so you are literally barking up the wrong tree.",

Look it up. \n\nA funeral is also a pretext for meeting and planning. \n\nYou\u2019re literally defending an established JIHAD oriented group, which is Hezbollah. \n\nThose are facts!\n\nAnd the attacks on US/US#2 (Israel) was done by who in the name of what?\n\nJihad.\n\nIf the policy is to deport people for having ties with any Jihad-oriented group, then it\u2019s perfectly valid to deport her to. \n\nAnd this is why I mentioned Hamas. It was too shiny not to us given the recent events.\n\nBy going to a funeral of any party in any circumstance, you support that organization / individual tacitly. I don\u2019t even know why we\u2019re debating this. All you\u2019ve done is try to surf on emotions thinking that \u201cas long as it\u2019s a funeral, I can go to any terrorist organization without problems\u201d. \n\nThe second you get noticed in that sphere, you\u2019re on a list. And if policy is zero tolerance for that list, then there\u2019s nothing you can do except whine because you don\u2019t agree with it. \n\nBut sorry, democracy is that too.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not projecting anything. I\u2019m very relaxed actually. I\u2019m still waiting for rebuttals that are worthy because until now you\u2019ve been defending the right to attend a funeral, even if it\u2019s a terrorist organization. \n\nIt\u2019s unbelievable actually.

Talk like this, completely ignoring nuance, detail, and throwing all the blame on the \"other\" is entirely and completely counterproductive to a good debate and to convince other people of your point.

They helped 5 Nazis immigrate to the US who played a significant role- like Klaus Barbie. Am I missing something?\n\nYou are correct on the FBI. I concede to that.\n\nFollowing Operation Paperclip, numerous Nazi scientists and engineers, including Wernher von Braun, were brought to the United States to work on rocket and space programs, despite their Nazi affiliations and involvement in the war effort. \n\n[Source](https://time.com/6322156/history-of-nazi-immigration/) | \u201cThe most well-known instance of Nazi collaborators immigrating to the U.S. was through Operation Paperclip, in which some 1,600 Nazi scientists and engineers were employed by the U.S. government and given residence and citizenship in the ensuing years. German scientist and pioneer of space flight Wernher Von Braun was notably recruited through this program. His contributions to the U.S. space program have been celebrated; Huntsville, Ala., has both a day (Feb. 24) and a 9,000-seat arena named after him. Yet the work that earned him the reputation that enabled his immigration to the U.S. was indefensible. Von Braun contributed to the use of brutal and enslaved labor in the Mittelwerk rocket engineering complex during his time as a Nazi.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m just sharing information.
