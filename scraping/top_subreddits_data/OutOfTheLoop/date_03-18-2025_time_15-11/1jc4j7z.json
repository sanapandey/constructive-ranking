            "body": "Answer: they were a monopoly , so they forced local yarn and fabric shops out of business. Now that they are closing, there is a huge gap left. \n\nThey were sold to a private equity company. They basically are choosing to close so the owners /shareholders make a bunch of short term money when the locations liquidate. \n\nMeanwhile, tens of thousands of people (mostly women) are completely stranded now when it comes to anything involving yarn and fabric. So many small (Etsy and craft) businesses rely on Joann fabrics and there isn't another good option. Their in-house yarn brand also has great LGBTQ pride yarns for cheap. \n\nIt's kicking people while they're down.",

So just because the competition \"exists\" doesn't mean the niche will be filled quickly\n\nEdit to add: If you want to boycott unethical companies and vote with your wallet, apparently Hobby Lobby is a no go due to various actions they've taken as a company (stealing artifacts from other countries, denying coverage for certain medications for their employees, etc. )",

A photo on an online storefront just isn't good enough.\n\n\nWith how popular cosplay and similar hobbies have gotten, in addition to the smaller etsy-like businesses, there's really no reason Joann should be going under other than corporate vampires and poor management.",

Have you ever tried on (or ordered online) a piece of clothing that you thought would be great, but it just felt or looked wrong when you tried it on? Too-stiff fabric, or it\u2019s an awkward color with your skin tone, or the material was too hot, or too cold, or too see-through, or too scratchy, or the photo online was photoshopped on the model\u2026 that\u2019s an even bigger problem buying fabric for handmade items than it is with normal clothes shopping IMO, because once raw fabric is cut from a bolt, it\u2019s hard to return it and you might not get all your money back, and it can be pretty expensive in the first place\u2014much more so than a Shein haul or whatever people are doing these days. You need to know what you\u2019re buying. Light summery almost-see-through linen and heavy winter wool can look almost identical in a bolt in an online storefront photo. A lot of online storefronts are full of shitty knockoff materials whose quality doesn\u2019t match the advertisements and sale page info. Buying fabric in-person is infinitely better if you can make it happen. \n\nLighting in online photos can also be inconsistent, so it\u2019s hard to tell if colors match. Do they look nice together? Is this a blue green or a yellow green or a grey? How saturated will this color be in *my* house? I crochet, and many big crochet projects require multiple skeins of the same color yarn, so this is my personal bugbear. The precise shade of the dye used on fabric can vary between dye lots, occasionally with very obvious results. It\u2019s important when buying yarn to get as much yarn from the same lot as you can to avoid your finished work looking weird. An order from an online store will rarely if *ever* all come from the same dye lot, making online yarn orders a crapshoot for a decently sized project. Some places will try, but nobody can promise anything. Physical stores are the only 100% reliable solution. \n\nI\u2019m lucky to live near a Michael\u2019s that keeps a big stock of yarn, but a lot of people don\u2019t, and that Michael\u2019s and the local Walmart are my only options. The local indie fabric and yarn stores are only open, like, 10-2 Tuesdays and half an hour every fifth blue moon or whatever, and they only cater to quilters and knitters who have different needs. Joann\u2019s dying to corporate BS shenanigans sucks.",

I think I was supposed to have been charged $40?  It kept getting delayed. They charged me when I finally got it, and charged $50ish dollars. \n\nMy first thought was, well this is why everyone buys from Amazon. \n\nWhen they announced the bankruptcy I wasn\u2019t surprised just based on my 1 interaction. \n\n\nOn another note, I got into crocheting in January and bought a ton of yarn from actual in Joann stores. I very much did my part to help haha \n\nI\u2019m now going to try Hobii and LindeHobby for yarn. Hoping it works out. People in crocheting seem to like them",

Taffetas ate stiff, light silks and thin fabrics drape except for say starched voile. Spandex is damn spandex and you can tell how it'll work from a scrap. Swatches is how design companies, costumes for stage and screen start. Thats how I was trained in college: know how different fibers and fabric types behave, light on fire to see what it really is and how to test draping on one of those life drawing stick men. You don't make a huge order to see how it drapes. You pick and go from there. There was a very high end fabric store in Detroit we always went to that had Swatche books for their imported goods like Italian lace, fully beaded and you pick from there. My grandma made wild wedding dresses in sizes places didn't carry and brides picked from swatches. \n\nJoann's didn't carry high quality fabrics.  You couldn't even get a decent bottom weight without a print half the time and good luck finding 100% cotton outside of quilting. I got really good at dye work since the only time found something decent it only came in ivory. We made it teal, we color they didn't carry in anything. \n\nIf you're looking for really specific stuff online is rhe way to go and many times small mom and pop stores will show you on camera.\n\nTldr: learn your fabric types and fibers and you will know from a swatch and Barbie. Just takes practice. Once you learn a store it's easy too. Every color of silk taffeta at Silk Baron behave the same for example.",

Lucky Brand Jeans actually provides an interesting case study since they also had a denim line at Joann\u2019s. \n\nComparing without sales: Buying new pair of Lucky jeans is around $100. \n\nMaking them is a bit more complicated. The Lucky denim is 20.99 per yard. You will need 2.5 yards, so ~$53. Some muslin($2per yd) for pockets, so ~$1. A jeans zipper is going be ~3. A 6 pack of Jean buttons is ~$5. And if you need a pattern that will be ~19. So all told your at about $81 for making jeans. \n\nSo you can make jeans for around $19 less then you can buy them in the same quality denim. That is before you consider sales. Patterns are almost never bought full price for non-emergancy purchases. Usually at least one \u201cBrand\u201d is on sale for between 2-5 dollars. Joann also had regular fabric sales and I almost always had a 40% one full price item coupons.",

I was taking a beginner's sewing class just before the pandemic hit and it was about $50 in materials for a long-sleeved shirt (my class got cancelled so I never did finish learning how to sew properly).\n\nThat said, if you're really fussy about wanting something that fits perfectly to your body or with a certain material, that can be the appeal of sewing. That and actually sewing can be kinda peaceful, at least it could be once I got the hang of the basics but I still can't make nice stuff.",

So, the company is forced to pay back the PE over the course of 5 years, while still owing it's entire purchase price to the PE.\n\nIf the company sells for more than that balance, their are various company shares that then get paid out.  Typically the PE shareholders own about 75% of those, and the remaining 25% are generally paid out to various owned company employees.\n\nThat is sort of the high level and simplified version.  But no, this is not globally legal, it is generally an American thing.\n\nBy making deep cuts, the companies short-term profitability can be siphoned off for interest payments while coasting on the company's brand and loyal customers to continue stable revenue.  Eventually the decreased staffing takes it's toll, but by then, they may be onto their 2nd or 3rd PE ownership.",

For example, the parent company could own the IP rights for Joann Fabric, and would then license it to a toootally, definitely, take-my-word, pinky-promise, definitely independently run company that just so happens to actually own/operate/manage Joann stores (and which also happens to accrue all the debt).\n\nNow, it's possible for owners to be so egregious with companies that the legal authorities decide they aren't actually separate entities. This is called \"piercing the corporate veil\". For example, if that restaurant owner didn't have a separate bank account for the restaurant, or if they took money out of the restaurant's bank account for personal things like mortgage payments or a vacation or something, then you can tell that the business and owner aren't really operating as separate entities. \n\nI am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice, and I have no proof that any such set up was used. This is just a hypothetical about how separation between a business and its owner may work, and how that's not necessarily a bad thing. You don't necessarily want to ruin a business owner's whole life just because the business failed. We're more sympathetic in the case of mom 'n' pop shops, but the basic principle is the same.\n\nThere are of course other ways to extract wealth from businesses. Being an executive and receiving extreme pay. Being a shareholder and receiving dividends. Lending money to the business at a significant interest rate. The list goes on and on. I'm sure that many of these would be thrown out as illegal (or as fake ploys to avoid financial responsibility) if push came to shove, and if it was obviously not in good faith.",

If those businesses had remained all the prices would have remained more reasonable and the communities intact.\n\n Instead, because of predatory business practices our communities, both the workers and the artisans are shattered yet again and subject to the price hikes of new commercial leases, new business creation and new wholesale relationships.

There are TONS of legitimate criticisms about private equity, but the idea that anyone buys a business to saddle it with debt and sell it for parts and declare bankruptcy makes no sense. The basic core of the private equity model is to buy a company with debt and then sell it for 3-5 years for more money. If you succeed, because you used debt to buy it, it significantly enhances your return\n\nJust to show the absurdity of this - the lenders to private equity are often Goldman Sachs, JPM, Morgan Stanley, etc. Why is Goldman Sachs lending money to a company, letting the PE fund scavenge the company for parts, and then leaving Goldman Sachs holding the bag as the debt holder of a useless shell? They\u2019re not doing that because it would be the dumbest business model ever.\n\nIt makes for a fun, evil sounding story, but the stories even behind toys r us, red lobster, etc. are way more complicated than Reddit would have you believe. The day to day mismanagement that led to the collapse of toys r us is written about in business books",

Bankruptcy will first pay off the debt that they were saddled with, which never would've existed if not for the buyout by Leonard Green (the PE company) using debt. Leonard Green likely didn't make money in this particular instance, however their loss is likely not as substantial as one would think.\n\nThe ideal PE company playbook usually looks like this:\n\n1) Buy a company with debt. Said debt now belongs to the company, not yourself. Since this company now has several billions of dollars worth of debt, they need some way to pay it off. Previous shareholders dgaf because they got paid for their stake at the sale. \n\n2) To pay off the debt, enlist consultants (usually from the PE company), paying them excessive amounts to address the debt problem. Liquidate assets for short-term profit to make the company's financials look better. An example of this would be Red Lobster, which sold all of its locations. This led to them having to rent the locations in future for above-market rates, but in the short-term selling the locations reduced their debt.\n\n3) Sell the company for a profit before shit hits the fan. This isn't always successful (as in the case of Joann's) but due to the leveraged debt buyout tactic, the amount of risk PE companies expose them to is far, far less than you think and also far less than the potential reward. \n\nMore info on the Joann PE acquisition can be found [here](https://www.privitas.com/leonard-greens-twice-bankrupt-joann-a-cautionary-tale). \n\nMore info on general PE shenanigans can be found [here](https://pestakeholder.org/news/dont-blame-the-shrimp-how-private-equity-is-bankrupting-america/).",

The bankruptcy closing went from only some stores will shut down to ALL stores will shut down. This was pretty disappointing for the people who were hoping there was at least one good JoAnn store within a reasonable distance.\n\n\n2. At the stores everything is 20-50% off currently. Anyone who has been a regular shopper knows this isn't really a deal yet. Even this is a lie because big ticket items like sewing machines are still 10% off. Customers are asking when the prices will drop and the employees have no clue. Many have resorted to wearing buttons that say \"I have no idea when we are closing/when sales drop etc.\"\u00a0\n\n\n3. Somehow in 2025 people still don't think to check the signs that says \"Up to 50% off!\" mean \"UP TO 50% off\" and get mad at employees for not giving them 50% off at checkout because they can't read.\n\n\n4. They stopped accepting any remaining gift cards at the end of February. There was not a lot of ways to know this was going to happen unless you caught it on the news or were looking into it online at the right time. Obviously not a lot of the older customer base did that and are now harassing employees calling them thieves for not accepting cards anymore even though they can't accept them as payment if they wanted to.\n\n\n5. Great America (the liquidation company) is hiring temp workers to help with the demand at stores that are being paid more than the long term employees that are sticking around to the end.",

I follow a lot of creators on social media and I\u2019ve been delighted to see men and women create really amazing things. Groups like the cosplay community, and drag queens and kings, have also revitalized it. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed a downward trend in fabric, both in the clothing we wear, and fabric/yarns etc at craft stores. The quality has gotten exponentially worse. I used to be able to go to thrift stores and easily find good quality linens, wools etc. Now even the thrift stores are full of cheap polyester fast fashion.  \n\nThe same is true of fabric on the bolt. Places like Walmart, hobby lobby, and Michael\u2019s, carry the absolute most trash fabric, in terms of quality. Even the 100% cotton is cheaply produced and horrible. Joanns had its share of that, but it also carried some good quality fabric for reasonable prices. I\u2019m really going to miss that. \n\nThere are still very successful smaller stores that carry nice fabric and yarn. It\u2019s more expensive, with a much smaller stock, but they are successful. For someone like me who can\u2019t always spend that much, Joann had a reasonably large stock of pretty good quality fabric, so I could plan a project, and say to myself: \u201cI want to make this out of a lightweight stripped linen in warm colors.\u201d And I\u2019d be likely to find what I need. I\u2019m going to miss that, too!\n\nI agree that sewing and crafting has been declining overall since probably the 80s, but I\u2019m sad that we\u2019re losing a resource like Joann, just as it\u2019s been picking up again.  \n\nIn short, I don\u2019t think this happened because \u201cno one sews anymore.\u201d I think Joann was still very busy and profitable, and could have adapted to what the market wanted. This happened because of corporate greed. One sign of that was how they paid their employees absolute dogshit wages. There were people at the top just milking every last dime out of the place. And then the private equity firm bought it purposely to sink debt into and bankrupt it.",

Now barely any have one.\n\nJust because there's a niche on Instagram, Pinterest and Etsy doesn't mean it's really kicking.\n\nMany of those stores even just resell items imported for 3rd world countries.\n\nThe truth is that now most people buy their costumes, throw away their clothes when they are prematurely worn and if they need any kind of fixing, adjustments or tailoring, they outsource it to a dry cleaner's.",
