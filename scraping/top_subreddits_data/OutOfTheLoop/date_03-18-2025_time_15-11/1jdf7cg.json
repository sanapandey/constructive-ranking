But last year I clicked on a Michael Tracy YT video criticizing the narrative, so lately my feed has been bombarded with a back and forth between the two, and it's too much to dig into for a casual viewer with spotty attention span. \n\nHere's the latest Tracy video, from today:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGMlsuP3e78\n\nHere's the latest Krakauer video, posted about a month ago:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfUg1PZO2PI\n\nHere's a reddit thread posted 4 months ago:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Mountaineering/comments/1ge93on/response_to_jon_krakauer_michael_tracy/",

            "body": "Answer: Krakauer's account of the 1996 Everest tragedy, initially published as an \"Outside\" magazine article and later developed into the book, \"Into Thin Air,\" leaves room for criticism.  And there have been differing accounts which have criticized Krakauer's version. He has admitted mistakes. But Tracy seems to be making a meal of things - stretching legitimate critiques beyond what is reasonable. \n\nSome of Tracy's criticisms center on a purported defense of Sandy Pittman, \"a hateably rich white woman who wrote dispatches of the climb for an NBC website and was friends with Martha Stewart\\[.\\]\"\n\nThis Slate article offers a good summary & does not seem to think much of Tracy's efforts: [https://slate.com/culture/2025/02/into-thin-air-book-story-youtube-debate.html](https://slate.com/culture/2025/02/into-thin-air-book-story-youtube-debate.html)\n\n\"Tracy initially claims to be defending Pittman from misogynistic attacks in the first of 17 videos he has posted to YouTube about Everest 1996 over the past year. However, it soon became obvious that Krakauer is his real target. Replete with impressive-looking info dumps, sketchy arguments, shameless speculation, crude taunting, and juvenile A.I.\u2013generated images, Tracy\u2019s videos come across as quintessential YouTube crankery. Either despite or because of this, they\u2019ve earned him 134,000 subscribers.\n\n...\n\nTracy objects to what he asserts is Krakauer\u2019s preferred \u201cnarrative\u201d: that \u201cinexperienced climbers,\u201d particularly Pittman, were \u201cthe root of all evil on the mountain.\u201d This is a gross misrepresentation of *Into Thin Air*. Pittman was certainly widely reviled in the aftermath of Everest 1996 (and in the years since), but this was largely the result of a [dishy Vanity Fair profile](https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/1996/8/snow-blind-ambition), not Krakauer\u2019s book.\"",

It is like asking a bunch of extremely hungover college kids what they did last night. They'd likely get the gist of everything down vaguely correct, but details and specifics become extremely fuzzy and different people might remember different parts of an event and at best you can sketch a decent idea of the sequence of events but ultimately you throw up your hands and have to say, \"good enough\".",
