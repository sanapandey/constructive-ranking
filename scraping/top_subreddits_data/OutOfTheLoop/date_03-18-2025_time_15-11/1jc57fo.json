Is this related to the rapid decline of Trump's approval rating over the past month or so?",

Founder Nate Silver left in 2023, taking the rights to his forecasting model with him to his website Silver Bulletin. 538's new owner, Disney, hired G. Elliott Morris to develop a new model. On September 18, 2023, the original website domain at fivethirtyeight.com was closed, and web traffic became redirected to ABC News pages. The logo was replaced, with the name 538 used instead of FiveThirtyEight. On March 5, 2025, the website was shut down by ABC News and its staff was laid off.",

And I see that line of reasoning often - if there's a 1% chance of something happening, and it happens, that doesn't mean the prediction was wrong, it's just a very unlikely thing happening. \n\nFair enough, but how does one actually evaluate these models? The only thing I can think of is to see if the models more reliably point towards the most eventual outcome.\n\nIf that 1% prediction happens once, then fine, it was an unlikely event. But if I predict a 1% chance of something happening and it happens every time, then clearly there's something wrong with my model. The chances of a 1% event happening over and over and over are theoretically possible but approach an infinitely small amount.\n\nSame thing, just to a less dramatic degree, with different probabilities. If I predict X has a likelihood of happening 60% of the time and the event occurs 10 times out of 100, then the actual outcomes aren't matching my prediction, and the model is likely wrong.\n\nSo I know that elections have all kinds of crazy variables that can't be quantified. There's also the fact that we can't run the 2024 presidential election 100 times to see what the distribution of outcomes is. I know the actual variables change from day to day and every new election is a unique event that can't be predicted fully from past elections. \n\nBut I also think it's a little disingenuous to slap people down and say that these predictions are not soothsaying - if an unlikely outcome takes place according to the model, it's perfectly valid to criticize the model. And if the models can't consistently give us confidence about the outcomes then they are not worth it. At best, they're the only thing we have - fine, but then people really shouldn't care about them as much as we do.",

And he has been *extremely* accurate in pretty much all of these elections.  Far more so than conventional wisdom.  This includes the last election when he was basically dead on the money.\n\nThere's also a fair amount of a complete lack of understanding of how statistics work.  For example, people will insist that Silver was \"wrong\" in 2016 because he only gave Trump a ~40% chance of winning.  After all a 40% chance is less than 50%, so it can never happen.\n\nThe nonsense you see here is another example.  Silver had the odds near 50/50, so if you're innumerate, you think that means that he must be predicting that the final margin will be razor close.  But that's not how things work, as Silver carefully explained over and over ahead of time.",

            "body": "Answer:  I'm going to look at 538 from a bit of a more wide angle lens.  538 started out as an extremely wonky poll-data analysis blog, independent of any major news organization.  Following Nate Silver making some good predictions of upcoming presidential elections, as well as having gained a reputation amongst politics junkies as a good site to get information on upcoming elections, 538 was bought by ABC News.\n\nThis was inherently a problem for everyone involved.  The big issue is that what 538 did well was very niche, interested in by a narrow group of people, and really only relevant for 6-12 months every presidential election cycle.  That's fine when you're a small number of people running a blog, it's not OK when a major news organization acquires the site for millions of dollars.\n\nOne the things that ABC News did for many, many years following the acquisition was try to to turn 538 into a brand that had more appeal and penetration to a wider audience.  They tried to incorporate it into the national news broadcasts, they tried to simplify the polling data analysis into more easily digestable morsels, and they tried to apply their polling analysis methods into other news spheres (i.e. sports, science news, etc.).  What ABC News found was that the audience 538 initially had was not sufficiently interest in other topics, and there wasn't enough of an audience for those other topics to justify the expense of the site.\n\nThis is all a long way of saying, the amount of interest in what 538 did was enough to support a blog, but maybe not enough to support a division of a major news organization.  It's sad that 538 is going away, but there will be other people doing this type of analysis, though hopefully they will be smart enough to keep it at a small enough scale that it will be sustainable.",
