Coyote. \n\nTesla supporters are having a fit. However, every single engineer and safety expert has said relying on cameras only is a huge mistake and will kill people. Mark Rober just made a cool video showing what everyone else already knew.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/IQJL3htsDyQ?si=MX-W092eloM43Thv",

And we don't just have eyes, we have a whole bunch of other senses. One of the ones I use the most while driving is feel, you can feel going off the road surface, or if the car is speeding up or slowing down, or in the winter especially the very beginning stages of losing traction. Before you see the back end kicking out, you feel it.\n\nThere's also sound. Sound is huge. You can hear other people on the road at times you can't even see them.\n\nAnd second, Jesus christ if I could also have lidar built into my chest and have a super enhances radar sense, I would. It would make me better at everything.\n\nExcept driving I guess, in that specific case. Since I guess a chest mounted lidar wouldn't really do much inside the cabin. But you get what I mean.",

Elon basically believes that AI can dramatically outperform a human being and therefore \"if a human can drive very well with only eyes, then a car can drive even better with only cameras\".\n\nThis is basically how you can tell that Elon absolutely DOES NOT know anything about engineering. Not only are cameras not even close to how eyes operate, but like... if humans had LIDAR-like senses then we could dramatically outperform humans without LIDAR-like senses anyway.",

A car doesn't need to have that limitation, it doesn't need to risk that something has changed to your left while you're looking right.

Which do you believe?\n\nWhy do I only have one bit of information from each sensor?\n\nI mean, the obvious change you could make here is to add a probability:\n\n* One says it's 90% sure it's clear, but there's a 10% chance there's an obstacle in the way. The other is 100% sure it's clear. Probably nothing there, maybe slow down a tiny bit just in case.\n* One says it's 80% sure it's clear, but there's a 20% chance there's an obstacle in the way. The other is 100% sure it sees an obstacle. Probably brake now and ask forgiveness later if it was nothing.\n\nYou could even compare the sensor to previous readings -- if it saw no obstacle a millisecond ago and now the entire view is obscured, maybe that's a glitch. Or just apply some pattern-matching to see if the picture you're getting back from it even looks like a picture at all, or if it looks like there's some dirt or something in front of the sensor.

Ordinarily, when these sensors disagree wildly, the pilots are notified of that disagreement. There are scenarios in which *they* can choose which sensor (or group of sensors) to trust. Often, the simplest way is to split the sensors into two groups, one for the captain and one for the first officer, and then they can just see whose display makes sense.\n\nOne of the biggest problems the Max had was that they *didn't* do any of that for MCAS -- that was based entirely on *one* set of instruments. So never mind trying to figure out how to switch them over automatically, IIRC they couldn't even *manually* choose which instrument MCAS should believe.",

Road lines aren't clear anymore, GPS may be interrupted and spotty.\n\n\nWhat do you propose the result will be? If the cars just decide not to drive, suddenly everyone in the city is stranded with a car wherever they happen to be. There's not enough taxis and tow trucks for everyone to get home when their cars decide not to drive. Practically speaking, the only acceptable solution drivers would accept would be the cars attempt to drive in inclement weather regardless. And predictably, if they do a bad job of it, it's going to cause a lot of crashes and accidents.\n\n\nLike, self-driving can't target just working 80% of the time, people need their cars all of the time, even during emergencies. The self-driving has to be good enough to handle the worst situations.",

There's a certain amount of chaos and randomness that will occur in mistakes that a human makes.\n\n\nA software program that is bad at something, will be bad at the same things that other copies of the software are bad at. They will all make the same mistake.\n\n\nLets take an example of \"Do you notice a stop sign in front of an intersection.\" Humans might miss a stop sign occasionally, but it's going to be unpredictable and spread out across the country randomly. No individual intersection will be the result of every crash nation-wide, and city tow trucks, hospitals, police, and policy makers have a manageable problem to deal with.\n\n\nBut what happens when a software program misses a stop sign? It's the exact same program in every car, if there is a problematic sign, every car that goes past the sign will have the same problem and crash at the same intersection. Even if nation-wide the rate of missing stop signs went down overall, now one community has *all* of the cars crashing at one sign. Easily overloading a local community who can't deal with such a hotspot of car crashes. They would need to shut the intersection down, the local economy would crash, locals would be forced to update their self-driving program before going on the street again, what if their car no longer gets updates? Who is responsible for fixing the situation?\n\n\nAnd that's even assuming everyone is playing by the rules. What if car CEO decides self-driving cars should perform worse in liberal cities? They could send updates at any time that could destroy economies. Who is in charge of auditing the driving algorithm to make sure that doesn't happen?\n\n\nIt's a very complicated topic that is not just solved by making the goal to do better than humans in one statistic.",

The people who criticize this approach do so from a perspective that says that certain driving conditions would benefit greatly from input beyond standard vision- I.e limited vision conditions such as night and rainy condition (although rainy conditions can lead to other problems for other systems).  \n\nThere are pros and cons to both approaches. \nMy understanding is that most researchers (see Andrej Karpathy\u2019s comments on the topic) agree that using cameras alone would suffice for human level driving. I don\u2019t think anyone would say that adding lidar would be detrimental to the system but it definitely has diminishing returns and I don\u2019t think Tesla believes that the benefits from it would justify the cost.

                            "body": "FWIW while I agree with the conclusion, I don't think what you said are the proper arguments for / against vision-only self-driving.\n\nVision-only driving cars also can feel the road via accelerometers and gyroscopes (which a car has plenty of), and can probably do it more accurately than a human could. They also can sense sound. A car also has more than 2 cameras and has larger coverage than a human does. The real superpower a human has over a vision-based self-driving car is really our brains, where we could analyze a situation with contexts and deal with the edge cases that come up every day. Computer algorithms aren't there yet and need the extra help a lidar could give.\n\nAs for the reasons for the argument for a lidar-less car, part of the argument is mostly that lidar fails in some environmental scenarios where cameras *have* to work by themselves (let's say in a heavy downpour). In the best case scenario a lidar would work, but for engineering you should engineer for the worst case, and if you are already doing that and vision has to work already, then it's better to just focus on making that work. Over reliance on lidar may result in optimizing for a local optima that doesn't fix the edge cases. There's a reason Google Waymo started its rollout in Phoenix where these environmental edge cases don't exist. Also, roads today are designed to be driven by humans, and therefore in *theory*, a camera-only car can drive just fine because it can replicate what a human could do. If a road condition is such that a camera-only system wouldn't work, then it's also unsafe for a human to drive on to begin with and it should be closed.\n\nTaking the video for example, in the fog / rain test cases where the Tesla failed, I would argue the issue isn't with the cameras, but the control logic. It's clear the car could not see through the rain (neither could the lidar-based car). The correct human-like behavior is to simply slow down and crawl through that area. The Tesla just drove through it with a high speed. For the last example (fake wall with a road painted on) some could argue it's an unrealistic situation, and some could argue it's yet another edge cases that the vision based system isn't good enough, since a human could still tell it's not an actual road based on vision alone. If a human actually *couldn't* tell it's a fake road, then maybe that road is really dangerous and shouldn't be open to the public.\n\nThere are more nuances to these arguments but I think that's a better framework to think about them and understand where the debate is.",

Musk refused to accept Lidar because it cost (at the time) thousands of dollars to install it in a car while cameras were a couple of dollars each. His take was that with sufficient machine learning, you wouldn't need lidar. The problem is that everything in software is predicated on the input being as accurate as possible. There's a software term \"Garbage In/Garbage Out\" which is meant to blame bad outcome of software on bad input. Well, this is a great case of bad input. His decision has literally killed people. The first crash I heard about was a Tesla driving full speed into the side of a semi truck that was painted white. The camera thought it was the horizon. They of course blamed the driver for not taking over, but that's the problem with autonomous driving. If the car is doing everything, expecting a person to maintain vigilance isn't practical. In this case, he got bored and started watching Harry Potter on his laptop. You look at the safety records of the lidar based systems, and they are leaps and bounds ahead.",

With cameras it's impossible because it won't drive in rain or fog which is conditions found in most nations. And back in 2014 even with lidar you wouldn't really get anywhere. We are over a decade later and the autopilot Elon promised every year is nowhere to be seen.\n\nBut today it's getting possible. Back then Elon was sorta correct, it was overkill. The idea was to put lidar in all cars and then keep updating the car until it was self-driving. But that's $15K extra a car for something that does absolutely nothing yet. It was easier to call it totally useless and a waste.\n\nUnfortunately even the people marketing it are underselling it as they are not Elon. It can see round corners which humans can't. So it can see cars that are incoming. And it looks past fog and rain. For these cars prediction is everything and you have corners in all cities. Lidar will drive way better than humans. Cameras will never see past corners.",

Which system do you believe in that case? Lidar is more accurate in more situations, but cameras are significantly more accurate but only in a minority of situations. And lidar has absolutely no idea or ability to tell when it's in a situation it can handle, or a situation it can't whereas vision doesn't have that issue with proper training.\n\nDon't get me wrong--I think both sensor suites are best.

Lidar doesn't work well in precipitation events, and lidar isn't capable of telling whether it's undergoing a precipitation event or if there's a lot of semi-trucks nearby in heavy traffic. To lidar, the two situations look identical--big walls surrounding you.\n\nIf you don't believe me, just look at Waymo. They have a several year head start over Tesla, but their self driving system is still only capable of functioning in deserts or no-precipitation days in other climates.\n\nThe only system that's likely to be better than vision-only, is vision-dominant where it's smart enough to know when lidar will assist and when it will be giving false positives. But again, that means the vision side must be superior to the lidar side, which is not the approach the desert-locked automakers are taking. Lidar-only is a dead end for driving outside of deserts to anyone who comprehends the tech, pending brand-new lidar technologies that we have not yet invented.\n\nVision-only itself is fine. That doesn't mean that it can take on superhuman tasks, nor is that a good idea because we need to coexist with pedestrians and human drivers. Ask any actual FSD owner in real life (not anonymously on reddit where people are incentivized to lie for karma) about how FSD is doing today. It slows down in situations like what was showed in Mark's video, except for perhaps the Loony Tunes situation. There is absolutely no way that you'll be able to get your Tesla to move so fast through heavy fog or rain that heavy if you are actually using FSD and aren't manually pressing down the gas pedal. It's incredibly easy to disprove Mark's video by simply owning and driving a Tesla yourself.",

Their point cloud densities for cars are all roughly the same (general design requirement is *can you see a child reliably). The only exception that comes to mind was Ubers test vehicle where they mounted the LIDAR so high on top of the car with so little down angle that their car ran that person over in AZ. Generally downward pointing or low mounted LIDARS would only struggle with the water test. That may be the only one that a normal car would have failed vs the testbed shown in the video.

You can make a decent prototype with these. But then you need supply chain, service, recalls, software upgrades etc. Making a real product you are ready to let customers use in the real world, tuning down false positives etc. We don't know how well this system actually performs in the real world...\n\nThere are reasons why their stock is down so much:  \nLuminar Technologies Inc 6.42\u00a0USD -139.98\u00a0(-95.61%) past 5 years",

Instead they kept the patents and ownership of the tech and still sold patent licenses, and simply made a pledge that they wouldn't pursue lawsuits on other companies violating the patents \"in good faith.\" [which they define as a party refraining from](https://www.tesla.com/en_ca/legal/additional-resources#:~:text=for%20so%20long%20as%20such%20party%20and%20its%20related%20or%20affiliated%20companies%20have%20not):\n\n1. Asserting, helping to assert, or financially backing the assertion of any intellectual property rights against Tesla or third parties using Tesla\u2019s technologies related to electric vehicles or equipment.\n2. Challenging, assisting in challenges, or financially supporting challenges to any Tesla patent.\n3. Marketing or selling knock-off Tesla products or providing any material assistance to another party doing so\n\nMost notably, point 1. In order to qualify as \"acting in good faith\" you have to **let Tesla violate your patents in return** because you must not make the assertion that Tesla is violating any intellectual property rights.\n\nImagine you're in charge of Toyota's EV division. Are you going to do this? Of course not. It would be monumentally stupid. The end result was that no major players actually took advantage of this \"Patent Pledge\". Tesla lost nothing and still got the appearance of moral high ground, which at the time was a very important thing to EV buyers, since it was largely a moral decision back when gas prices were lower.\n\nCompare to Toyota's similar actions. Toyota gave out (and is still giving out) free licenses for HEV and EV tech used in their Priuses starting in 2019.

We humans can interpret our surroundings and map them to a 3D \"map\" of where things are in relation with each other. Even before we get to object recognition part, we don't need to really identify object to know how far it is. Having a constant real time 3D map is FAR easier data for computers to handle, the most important part of the process is done by the imaging device itself: gauge distances. We don't need to know what it is to be able to make decisions.\n\nImage recognition is ass backwards: utilize sophisticated algorithms that require a lot of processing power and are almost impossible to make fool proof to achieve something that a LIDAR/RADAR can do without ANY processing: we simply list all the points in XYZ space and check where they are in relation to our trajectory. We can do further processing but it is very simple and fast, points close together in 3D space are most likely part of the same object.. It is all just pure logic, it is not complicated at all. The entire problem with them resides in the hardware that is used for sensing.\n\nSo, they are not using the expensive hardware but instead try to do it the hard way that is guaranteed to fail more just to save some money but from engineering standpoint it is INSANE idea. Even if the end goal is image recognition alone, it should be trained with LIDAR in place for a LOOOOONG time because of safety. Tesla is beta and alpha testing with end consumers on the public roads. Everything they do is ass backwards from safety and engineering point of view but absolutely logical if saving and making money is #1. Which it is for every company, traditional car companies just used to operate in space where fucking up meant bankrupcies.

We don\u2019t have politicians fighting for us the way we used to so now it\u2019s in the hands of the people. At least we have stuff like YouTube to offer rebuttals to all the nonsense, even if it\u2019s also platforming all the wrong info too. That\u2019s a broader regulatory issue though.",

At least with a regulatory body there can be focus and pre-emptive certification mechanisms as well as guidance on any legislation necessary to ensure safety.\n\nWith markets deciding, where we are headed absent of regulatory bodies, people will need to die first.  Money will need to be dug up from somewhere to do the research.  People will need to call their reps and demand action.  Those who already paid money are left in the lurch unless the company is responsible enough to do the recalls necessary and self-regulate.\n\nPeople boycotting due to safety concerns also does not always work (see Amazon and its sourcing), as without a regulatory body we're relying on influencers and a disorganized mess of information sources.  Not saying Mark Rober is inexperienced here of course, but in no way can he reasonably address EVERY safety concern with every vehicle like this...he would burn out, as well as run out of a budget for it.  Just seems like we're setting ourselves up for a wild west of painful regression going down this path we're going compared to the Nader days (and like you said, misinformation is definitely an issue too).\n\nI'm not really just thinking about cars here too...but all sorts of things, like plastic products we buy, food, infant care products, our waterways, all sorts of things that are facing deregulation.",

            "body": "answer: For years, Elon Musk has been dismissive of using LiDAR in autonomous vehicles. Each year, he promises that Tesla will have fully autonomous cars \"next year\" or \"very soon\" \u2014 a claim he's made annually for the past decade. He insists that Tesla's self-driving cars will rely solely on cameras and radar. Musk believes that with enough computational power and AI, the car can overcome challenges like optical illusions.\n\nIn contrast, LiDAR is primarily a \"reality capture\" technology that uses lasers to scan the environment with sub-centimeter accuracy from hundreds of yards away, which is crucial for high-speed driving on highways. Companies like Luminar, the leading LiDAR manufacturer in the U.S., have been developing this technology for years. Many automakers are adopting LiDAR as they recognize the grave safety risks of relying only on cameras and radar for autonomous driving. LiDAR enables cars to \"see\" through rain, fog, darkness, and snow\u2014conditions that cameras and radar alone cannot handle effectively.\n\nSome believe Musk has been trying to suppress or bet against Luminar's stock price, given that it\u2019s a publicly traded American tech company (checkout r/LAZR) and struggling despite its groundbreaking technology. Luminar is working with major automakers, universities, and other organizations to bring its product to market and create automotive standards for autonomy. Their LiDAR technology is already featured in the Volvo EX90 and will soon be incorporated into additional car models this year.",

            "body": "Answer: Mark Rober did an advertisement for a LIDAR company showing some of the flaws of teslas camera based systems. The examples he uses are extremely cherry picked to show issues with camera based systems, and he doesn't show any of the similar issues in LIDAR based systems. He successfully is cashing in on anti-elon musk sentiment. I don't think he was intentionally faking results, but the \"tests\" were designed to only show flaws in cameras.\n\n\nCameras, LIDAR, and radar all have significant issues individually, and the eventual ideal solution would use some combination of them. Tesla used to use multiple systems at the same time, but now only uses cameras due to the amount of false positives they would get when one system reports something bad is happening and another system doesn't. Waymo is generally considered the leader right now in autonomous vehicles while using LIDAR. Teslas current camera based systems are amazing for making drivers jobs easier, but have too high of a failure rate to be used fully autonomously. Teslas advertising around their current systems is just as misleading as Mark Robers tests.\n\n\nThe main complaints:\n\n* He doesn't actually use the tesla full self driving features, instead using manual driving or autopilot.\n* The examples he picks are cherry picked to highlight issues with cameras but doesn't point out similar issues with lidar. You could also contrive 50 tests that the tesla would pass but the Lidar company wouldnt. For example he uses a test where he shows lidar stopping for a massive deluge of water but doesn't point out the fact that cameras are actually better than lidar when it's raining. (this is a really dumb test, this situation wouldn't occur on an actual road).\n* In the example of the car driving into a painted Styrofoam wall autopilot was disengaged (this is a really dumb test, this situation wouldn't occur on an actual road). Another commenter has showed the full video, and the tesla disengaged the autopilot on its own a half second before collision.",

And they stopped using RADAR shortly after a TESLA ran into a parked fire truck, because they ignored RADAR for things on the side of the road.\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/tesla-autopilot-why-crash-radar/\n\n>For example he uses a test where he shows lidar stopping for a massive deluge of water but doesn't point out the fact that cameras are actually better than lidar when it's raining.\n\nBoth systems passed this test, so he didn't say LIDAR was better, just pass fail.  Also, I think there is a myth that LIDAR won't work in the rain, or is terrible in the rain.  This is not the case, as Rober's video showed, and this article covers.  https://ouster.com/insights/blog/lidar-vs-camera-comparison-in-the-rain\n\n> (this is a really dumb test, this situation wouldn't occur on an actual road)  [Regarding the rain deluge test]\n\nThere have been many times this has happened to me.  Driving in heavy rain with wind gusts would sometimes put up a wall of water that I could not see ten feet through.  It would only last a second, but it does happen.  Also, a semi passing could cause it as well.\n\n> In the example of the car driving into a painted Styrofoam wall autopilot was disengaged\n\nIf you go frame by frame through the video, you can see it shut off just before it hit the wall.  This is something Tesla is known to do.\n\n>On Thursday, NHTSA said it had discovered in 16 separate instances when this occurred that Autopilot \u201caborted vehicle control less than one second prior to the first impact,\u201d suggesting the driver was not prepared to assume full control over the vehicle. \n\nhttps://fortune.com/2022/06/10/elon-musk-tesla-nhtsa-investigation-traffic-safety-autonomous-fsd-fatal-probe/\n\nThe raw footage shows that it was active, but shut itself off. https://x.com/MarkRober/status/1901449395327094898",

The wall test is to emulate a parked semi truck with an add painted on the side or an actual painted wall at the side of the road. Obviously these will never match the road this perfectly, but a combination of tricky conditions could trigger this issue.\n\nThirdly, so autopilot disengaged on its own before the collision. Why?

We don't really know if the end results would have been different if he enabled AP sooner or kept it enabled.  My opinion is he still would have crashed into the wall but why enable it so late and disable it at all?\n\nHe posted the raw clip of him going through the wall here:\n\nhttps://x.com/MarkRober/status/1901449395327094898\n\nIf you look at the youtube video here:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/IQJL3htsDyQ?t=936\n\nThis is clearly a different take because:\n\n1. The speed in the youtube video never goes below 40 mph.\n\n2. The wall is slightly different.  (has wrinkles vs no wrinkles).\n\nUsing multiple takes is fine but I can't seem to find any clips of him going though the wall the first time so it is up to speculation if the AP applied the brakes or why the footage wasn't used.",

I personally just wish the experiment used FSD as I've always wondered how/if you can fool it with a painting like in the road runner cartoons lol.  I personally think you could but now we'll never really know unless another rich person wants to spend $$$ on an experiment like this.\n\nI've actually changed my mind a little since seeing Mark's raw footage.  You can see the painting of the wall is not color-matched with the road.  In the youtube video they edit it to match better with the sky/road.  There's a large enough difference that I believe FSD would see this as an \"object.\"  It would see some rectangle that is increasing in size as the car approaches it.\n\n> It'd be neat to have others try similar testing with some of the variables changed to see what other things can be learned. For science.\n\nThis is all I want.  I have my biases just like everyone in this thread.  I have a Tesla and use FSD all the time, I can pull up screenshots showing I've used it for 2 hours through Dallas without any interventions... on the flip side, someone can show me tons of instances where FSD does something stupid.  What they can't show me is FSD going through a wall painted to look like the road, because that isn't what Mark Rober did here.  \n\nEveryone is 100% correct when they say that the emergency braking should have stopped the car regardless, it is a bit of a failure that the active safety features couldn't detect a giant block in the road... but its still not using the FSD features.",

I have to wonder if FSD picked up on that and decided it was an obstacle or maybe even a semi truck.  He also used multiple takes approaching the wall with AP enabled but AFAIK there's only one take of him going through the wall.  \n\nIn that take he enables AP 3 seconds before hitting the wall and for some reason disables it 0.5 seconds before hitting the wall.  I don't think that 0.5 seconds matters but the question is why disable it then?  It was pretty deliberate.\n\nI think there's a non-zero chance that they tried with FSD and didn't get the results they hoped for and had to do a few takes with AP to get the car to go through the wall.

So the alternative is to use autopilot, and that assumes the driver isn't paying much attention and while the downside is you get way more phantom braking and false positives, the upside is you're less likely to be charged with vehicular manslaughter because you can see here, on autopilot, it actually stopped in time.  So i decided to be nice and call the score 1 to 1, and then I'd be even nicer and use the more conservative autopilot on the Tesla for all the remaining tests.",
