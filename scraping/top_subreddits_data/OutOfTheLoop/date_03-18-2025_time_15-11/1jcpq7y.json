    "selftext": "I came across a post about retired Park Ranger John Goodwin, who traveled from California to Washington, D.C., to organize a protest at the Lincoln Memorial. The protest was in support of public lands and National Park Service rangers.\n\n\n\nAccording to the post, he gave a speech and spoke with visitors, including kids, about the importance of public parks. While only about 10-15 people initially attended, a high school choir coincidentally arrived and sang This Land Is Our Land, making the moment even more special.\n\n\n\nDoes anyone have more context on his background, his reasons for protesting, or the broader movement he\u2019s part of?\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1jc49w7/retired\\_park\\_ranger\\_john\\_goodwin\\_at\\_the\\_lincoln/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1jc49w7/retired_park_ranger_john_goodwin_at_the_lincoln/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",

            "body": "Answer:  John Goodwin is a park ranger who worked for the National Parks for 27 years.  He would later write a book about his experience called \"Echos of the Badge\". Mr. Goodwin grew up visiting the parks and fell in love with them, wishing to become a ranger at a young age. \n\nHis reasons for protesting are quite clear, as the Trump administration is currently attempting to sell off park land, and firing a number of park workers and rangers under the guise of \"reducing the size of the government\", when in reality, it's just an attempt to funnel money into the pockets of companies and his family by the selling of land and mineral rights from protected public lands to private hands. \n\nThe broader movement he's a part of are those who are trying to stop this shift of public lands, which will forever destroy them by logging, mining and drilling.",
