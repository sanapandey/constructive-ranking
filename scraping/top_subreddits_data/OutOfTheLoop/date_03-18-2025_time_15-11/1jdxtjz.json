There are actual plans to dismantle it entirely. If that happens, what happens to public school funding? Special ed? Title IX?\n\nLike\u2026 is everyone just okay with states deciding on their own what kids do and don\u2019t deserve?? Because that\u2019s where this is headed. And I feel like nobody is even worried?\n\nI literally pulled over to get my thoughts out because I cannot believe this isn\u2019t a bigger conversation: https://youtu.be/YUr3YctyQMk\n\nAre people just not realizing what\u2019s happening or how it will affect them?",

The Trump admin is flooding the zone. Many regular people are already becoming fatigued. There are different groups, attorneys general, and other state officials that are filing lawsuits against the federal government to stop what is happening. Unfortunately the administration has shown they aren\u2019t necessarily going to do what the courts tell them to. So people are being left feeling confused and unsure what they can do.\n\nI tried very hard to be neutral on this but it\u2019s not very easy.",

But also, because he's taking the firehose approach, there's more room for the people who are supposed to stop him to miss something. They similarly can only fight so many battles at the same time. And lastly, he knows most of this is going to court, but because he's stirred such a massive shit storm all at once, it's going to clog up the courts fighting it, because again, they can only fight so many battles at the same time. So while they are focused on things A thru F, he's already onto thing Q and just trucking along...\n\nMy favorite part is, if any of this was done by a Dem, the republican base would be up in arms calling it treason, screaming that they can't do that. But because it's their guy, it's fine.",

And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.\u201d\n\n>This idea isn\u2019t new, but Bannon articulated it about as well as anyone can. The press ideally should sift fact from fiction and give the public the information it needs to make enlightened political choices. If you short-circuit that process by saturating the ecosystem with misinformation and overwhelm the media\u2019s ability to mediate, then you can disrupt the democratic process.\n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/steve-bannon-flood-zone-strategy-explained-trump-policy-blitz-2027482\n\n>\"The media can only\u2014because they're dumb and they're lazy\u2014they can only focus on one thing at a time.\"\n\n>\"And all we have to do is flood the zone,\" Bannon said. \"Every day we hit them with three things, they'll bite on one, and we'll get all of our stuff done.

Political rant incoming, hopefully it wont come across as disrespectful because disrespect is not my intention. I'm up late and presumably so are you. \n\nNoise fills silence. But that's literally it. We all know how our friends feel about the dismantling of the government, we dont need to talk about it because EVERY TIME that conversations ends with \"goddamn this sucks man\". \n\nFrom the prospective of power, elections matter most, the next one is 1.5 years away. So what should I do, phonebank for the democratic party? I\u2019m not convinced that's an effective way to persuade people into voting my way. The good people in America are opposed by a massive cult trained by a lifetime of practicing religion and valuing never questioning authority from their superiors (God, Trump). They don\u2019t understand politics is a reflection of personal values at scale; I'm horrified by who a meaningful percentage of this country has revealed themselves to be. It's not right that they won, but they did and now the only potentially-meaningful opposition party gives up power any time there's a potential for governmental conflict. Delay is a victory when legislating and democrats won\u2019t even fucking do that. \n\nI feel defeated because I am defeated. Truth and the seeking of truth are important, definitional part of mt identity. If this much political power can be gained from lies, I'm no longer certain the truth matters from a political perspective. I think politics mechanically might just be branding and bullshit, two things I fundamentally hate. There's no good way to end this rant, that's kind of the point. It's been 10 years, anytime friends and I talk politics we lose more hope. Or we realize hope was foolish to rely on, but even more foolish to hang on after hope fails. It sucks.",

Even though ED doesn't set the curriculum, it sets the guidelines for the same and if those are not followed, funding to the school can be affected. This restraint and the inclusion of all children has affected the testing criteria (according to the parents). Many support that the states should have the control for the funding and those parents who don't wish to send kids to public school, can send them to private schools instead(with vouchers). The funding for programmes for special needs children and those with disabilities will be allocated by the states. The takeaway is that people who voted for Trump want more control of their kid's education and feel that education is not something which should be dealt with at federal level. \n\nThese are not my views, information I gathered from that post. Most people like me obviously are against it(but I am not American) but I don't know what non-redditors think.",

While title IX and other efforts from the feds were really beneficial, other portions were not. No Child Left Behind (Bush II) was supposed to be inclusive for students. What it really did was slow the rest of the students to the speed that the \"inclusion\" students could manage. It also locked us into a test teaching spiral that has not ended to this day. The federal funding is NEVER enough to cover their mandates. For the last 30 years or so, the feds have been dictating to schools how to spend most of their budgets, underfunding their own requirements and demanding ever increasing testing performance. None of that crap actually leads to effective education of students.\n\nOut of all of the chaos and hysteria that this administration is generating, this item concerns me the least, because it has needed a thorough re-think for a long time. I do NOT think this administration is the correct one for a reasonable, effective re-think, but the next one might be, as it sorts through the rubble.",

I think the way they are going about it is not right, they should first probably set up where and how the currently funded schools and programs are going to get their funding before completely dismantling the system. That way, the less fortunate and vulnerable kids do not have to suffer. I do agree with most redditors that this will definitely affect the vulnerable kids in states where the budget is tight since less allocation of funds for these group of people. This also has the potential for discrimination, since states like Texas which has already tried to pass several anti trans bills can potentially succeed in setting up systems which will not allow/segregate based on gender or race. They already passed one for teaching the 10 commandments. This will also enforce teachings (religious) where population following that particular religion is in majority, leading to the minority population feeling side lined. May I know what you think about these points?",

You guys seem to be behaving like in some way any of this is okay or normal and looking to normal fixes. We in the rest of the world cannot understand why you are rolling over in this fashion. And we are and will all suffer as a result. People are and will die in increasingly greater numbers as research stops, aid dismantled, long standing alliances trashed.\n\nLearn from other countries, France - they march and protest and riot. South Korea- president declares martial law. Entire populace immediately pour out into the streets as one. Parliamentarians climb the walls to break into Congress. Martial law cancelled.  UK - poll tax riots. Oddly, to this day, Britain does not have a poll tax. Which reflects directly on your point, the riots were against the elected government. If Brits had sat around going \"they were voted in by a majority so what can we do\" that would never have happened\n\nGreat danger requires strong measures. Your systems and structures are being demolished as you wait for the next election.  I suspect your Founders would be ashamed of you.\n\nEdit: as an outsider it's maddening. As a consequence of mRNA vaccines we are very close to a vaccine for certain cancers. Your Secretary of Health is planning to cut all funding for rMNA research. We will all suffer and more than a few of us will die while you wait v19 months or more",

If you honestly think that this would be no different if Kamala had won and magas were cross I don't know what to tell you. You are actually in so many words saying they are all the same. It's just a ridiculous thing to say. \n\nYou don't \"think\" that they have the brain power to do irreparable damage. Meanwhile VOA has been dismantled, national land is being diverted, research and research institutions have been stopped or closed. You've cut Tues with nearly every ally in the world. Allies will never trust you again. Indeed your former allies are currently meeting to plan life without the US. You have nearly entirely lost the soft power you have spent decades building up. The world is moving away from America and you haven't even noticed.  I could go on and on.  To say the way you've always done it has always worked is even more ridiculous. Nothing that is going on has ever happened before in your country.  And if you think of martial law is declared then is the time to do something I don't know what to tell you. If martial law is declared you can do nothing about anything. Thank you for demonstrating the veracity of my comment. Your passivity will be your end. Good luck!\n\nEdit: one more thing. You are setting the entire world back on climate action and medical research.\n\nAnother one because I can't get over this reply. Government officials are disregarding Court orders. If this trajectory continues the rule of law will have totally broken down. As an example, as reported this morning, you just sent a number of Venezuelan workers to be imprisoned while you are being told they are gang members with zero public evidence. And your fellow countrymen are cheering. No doubt in your head Kamala would have been just as bad.\n\nI'll just leave this here\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/18/nx-s1-5326118/segregation-federal-contracts-far-regulation-trump",

It is time for everyone to reap what they sowed, and that is what is happening. We need to let them enjoy the fruits of their labor a while longer, because evidently Trump did not do enough damage the first time for enough people to get the message. Maybe the second attempt will suffice.\n\nIf you think that he elections will be \"canceled\" in two years, or in four, then that just shows me that you do not understand that the states run the elections, not the feds. The federal government can \"declare\" whatever they want, but the states will have elections as scheduled. If the red states choose not to participate, then only blue votes will be counted. How likely do you think that outcome is?",
