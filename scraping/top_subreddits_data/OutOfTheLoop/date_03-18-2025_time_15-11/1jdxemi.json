            "body": "answer:\nThe last mod /u/TJOcraft8 was the only moderator for the sub and let it get flooded with spam from advertising bots, specifically IPTV ads. There was so much constant spam that it was almost unusable. Several people reached out to the admins of reddit about this and the admins decided to remove the old mod and open a discussion for new mods.\n\nThe new mod team has started cleaning up spam and implementing rules and auto mod tooling to better manage the subreddit. This has lead to some contention as all power changes do. So far user activity has increased in just the past day so its looking like the sub will become healthy again in the near future.\n\nSource: Member of new mod team.",
