To explain further though, it seems the OP in the post you linked is a Joann\u2019s employee getting a little slap happy while writing sale signs as the company is clearing out stock in preparation for final closure. Joanne\u2019s doesn\u2019t sell propane. You can see other employees in the thread joking around about having to write a bajillion of these signs and kind of losing it.\n\nLater in the thread the OP clarifies she was laughing at the thought of the employee tasked with putting the signs up coming across this one in the pile.",
