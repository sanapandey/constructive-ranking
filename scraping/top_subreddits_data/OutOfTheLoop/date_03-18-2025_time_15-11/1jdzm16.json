    "selftext": "I was at my clients house today and they had fox news on and when I looked up from my book I saw them mention the deportation of these people but also them having their heads forcibly shaved, in shackles. Without context the scene really rubbed me the wrong way and it made me uncomfortable. \n\nI tried searching why they did that but I couldn't find anything about it. I figure maybe hair could be a status symbol in this gang, or perhaps a way to communicate gang affiliation perhaps? Is the only reasoning I could come up with for the shaving of heads. Does anyone know why they did that? \n\nI don't really know much at all about this news development so if I mistakenly labeled them illegal in case they aren't or whatever else, my bad. I'm just curious about the shaving. \n\nThis is an article that talks about it, shows the picture, but doesn't describe why it was being done- https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/16/deportation -alleged-gang-members-el-salvador",

There is a history of this being employed by all governments in different ways, you can also look up why the US military uses human silhouettes as targets after ww1.",

Jack Horner, who, despite making wild claims every so often, was revolutionary in the field had a bachelors of science in Geology and Zoology, and built his Paleontology career from the ground up. Yes, Zoology and Geology help a ton, but he did not go to any grad school or take any classes directly related to Paleontology.\n\nStill in the Paleontology field, Mary Anning, who was basically the mother of the entire field and the worlds first expert in the field had zero formal training. Her only schooling was a Sunday school.\n\nCharles Darwin went to medical school but was famously bad at it. He was introduced to entomology by his cousin. He had no relevant degrees when he went on his voyages with the Royal Navy, and thereafter wrote On The Origin of Species. He did obtain a BA from Cambridge, but this was not relevant to his foundational work in Evolution and Natural Selection.\n\nMichael Faraday, who discovered field inductance, and who's work is foundational to Field Theory had zero formal education.\n\nThis is just a few examples.\n\nAnyone can do science, and if they do it well, they can publish their work. Science education provides a baseline of knowledge and an understanding of the scientific process. Formal education is just one path to learning the basics.",

It's also worth noting that there was both precedent and motive for both explanations, and I'm not about to try to convince anyone one brand of evil is 'better,' the German nightmare was on a sadistic level and a massive scale, Japan had an unhealthy obsession with killing prisoners slowly for forbidden medical knowledge.  A huge chunk of todays EMTs and Doctors are taught with information gained from Japanese torture, sadly.\n\nEdit 2:  If you genuinely think I'm defending Germany at this point and can't see the sarcasm in calling them humane in comparison to Japan then I don't know what you expected from any of this besides someone to try and argue with to be 'right' about the holocaust.

The context of this discussion is the in-general treatment of prisoners/hostages/victims not their overall evilness.  Cynicality aside that's still the default for the majority of the world, right?  Certainly is for me, I still owe my grandfather to punch one in the face if I meet one.\n\nThey also made victims load the crematories and had victims pull the teeth of their own people for gold fillings.  The reactionary aggression's misplaced here, I'm talking about them accidentally doing a good thing and their general philosophy for their prisoners/victims.  By and large, German efforts were the efficient use and execution of 6-8 million people via logistics, infrastructure planning, ways to use their 'resources' before killing them, and ultimately chose its methods based upon practical factors like ZyklonB availability or guard manpower.  The Japanese essentially doubled as leaderless slaving parties regarding prisoners and half the reason we know about any of it was because some of the enterprising ones started getting scientific about it.  Germany was, without a doubt, a more 'humane' captor in the way we build 'humane' slaughterhouses.  They let their evil individuals do all that creepy shit because it served the purpose (and they genuinely liked it.)  \n\nI think you're fixating on one definition of the word humane here, when I hope it's abundantly clear that it's in a sarcastic and undercutting presence when discussing Nazis.\n\nGermany also allowed their doctors to vivisect 'subjects' as they saw fit and conducted dozens of variations of 'medicine' that deserve their own horror film, but they were *clinical* about it and unintentionally went about using good practices in the evilest ways.  Japan just let anyone with a knife figure shit out and paid a few people to take notes.  Germany was psychologically cruel with physical reinforcement, Japan was just carnal.  \n\nSee, nothing's humane about all of this, the only part about this was motivations on 'were they more afraid of lice, or did they just hate them enough.'  You've created this false equivalency and I'd like to show you that demonstrating an evil you know and are familiar with is still an evil, I'm not downplaying anything by up-playing something else.",

Clearly not correct. \n\nThe initial post was regarding the treatment of these Venezuelan men in a Salvadoran prison, not the deportation process.  They are not \"in this country\" at this point. \n\nI know nothing about how these people were deported, and I am not arguing that point.  (And unless you were part of the process, neither do you, because the press reports nothing accurately.) \n\nMy point is that once they are outside the borders of the US, they have no protection from the US Constitution.  The US government has no authority over or responsibility for how Salvadoran prisons are run or how they treat non-citizens within the borders of their country.",

Gitmo is outside the US; that's how they got away with what they did.  No Constitutional protection.  \n\nLook, I'm not defending it.  I'm just saying this is the law.  And hoping US citizens realize what a blessing our Constitution really is. \n\n*IF* any of these dudes are indeed citizens of the US, or were in the US legally, then the *deportation* was indeed a violation of US due process.  \n\n*BUT* that is an entirely different set of facts as to what is being alleged.  I think it's pretty commonly accepted that they are foreign nationals with multiple international warrants outstanding, nothing even close to a Visa or a green card. To my knowledge, the facts are not being questioned.\n\nThe case before the bar is *not* whether they should have been deported.  It is whether the use of the Insurrection Act of 1807 was the correct administrative vehicle to do so.   \n\nAnd as I said before, once you are outside the US, you are outside its protections.  Once that plane hit international airspace, there was no calling it back.  \n\nSince they are now in Salvadoran custody, they are at the mercy of the Salvadoran legal system, such as it is, and their only potential advocate is the Venezuelan authorities.

I have only ever seen that in the military. \n\nIf there was a lice outbreak, we spent time picking nits off each other and had a lice shampoo. \n\nI will edit to add that shaving is always an option, but only if an inmate requested it. The people who shave their heads are typically tied to a certain gang, so most people (my self and my peers) would never allow our heads shaved. The only other type that would shave their heads were black people who didnt want to fuss with hair maintenence, and again, that was a very small minority because styling hair was a good way to make commisary money. \n\nFor those curious, and hopefully I won't doxx myself, but the states were New York, Georgia, and Ohio.",

You have no idea what thinking I align myself with you just want to argue with some one you perceive to be on the other side even though I said ten times the deportations are wrong . Trumps rhetoric is wrong . All of it is wrong . To talk about humans like they\u2019re animals is wrong .

The judge is claiming he issued a \"verbal order\" to turn the planes around, but they were already in international air space and that direction doesn't appear in his injunction.\n\n>Because trials are public; if there had been a trial, we'd know about it.\n\nHow?

If they lose, they'll have to provide all the records to the courts and they are saying all of them demonstrate that these are criminal gang members.  We'll have to wait and see I guess?",

When the White House ignores legal process, everything else goes out the window. Look at Mahmoud Khalil\u2014a green card holder and legal US resident kidnapped from Columbia University by plainclothes DHS agents who told him he was being deported, even though that is illegal.
