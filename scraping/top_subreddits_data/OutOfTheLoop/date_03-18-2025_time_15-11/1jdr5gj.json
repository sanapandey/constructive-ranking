            "body": "Answer: \n\nThe Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is a federal presidential memorial. It\u2019s board of trustees have been presidential appointees who serve 6 years. It\u2019s former chairman, David Rubenstein, and the former trustees, have poured Hundreds of Millions into the building to bring in National shows, international arts, and local DC scene arts.\n\nIt\u2019s established by congressional order, which includes the mechanism for Presidents appointing trustees. There is no language about removal, but nor is there any hard responsibility for a trustee to contribute. Congress funds roughly 20% of the building budget, ticket sales and donations are the rest.\n\nTrump pulled this because last go around, the first set of Kennedy Center Honorees expressed their distaste and refusal to sit with the President. 45 dodged the embarrassment by not attending any of his four years.\n\nThis time, he\u2019s made clear he wants to pick the honorees. Best I can tell, that\u2019s the whole move to exact his revenge against a now deceased Norman Lear.\n\nArtists have reacted, as they\u2019re within their rights to do, and many have revoked their positions or associations, canceled shows, and refuse to participate in a Partisan Power Grab.\n\nPart of me would rather he be distracted with piddly bullshit like Arts Shows and stops poisoning international relations. Who knows",

All they did was just complain in online echo chambers, like these armchair reddit losers who rail about him on here when they will never change someone's mind or even meet someone who thought otherwise. All while whining about the echo chambers of the right. Abject fucking failures. No one does anything of merit. \n\nWhy the utter hell should us around the world care about their cultural exports when their culture seems to revolve around worshipping corporations, standing by while children are slaughtered and a festering and never-ending apathy/laziness. \n\nI am so fucking tired of pretending like Americans do anything other than whine, project opinions and then sit on their ass. They expect everyone else to fix their problems and then when they have to do it themselves they just whine and do it with the least amount of effort and efficiency humanly possible. Both sides are not the same in politics but they are the same in their failures and complaints. They both use the same tactics and same bitching and moaning, saying they're better than the other while not doing a single THING to prove it. \n\nJust talk. Talk. Talk.

You know that kid who didn't pitch in on the group project and still got credit for what everyone else did? Well about 5-15% of your country are the kids doing the work. The rest of you? Messing about on your phone while Whoeverthefuck finishes the assignment. And if you're wondering what side of that percentage you're on?

But I think your argument is built on a bit of bad faith. \n\n>half of the eligible voting population even turned up\n\nYeah, I agree. This is a problem we\u2019ve been dealing with for a long time. The reality of the situation is we vote based on an antiquated system that predates the Internet, radio/television, a modern postal system or even reliable interstate travel. Yeah, it sucks. We all know it sucks. I hate that states like Wyoming are given disproportionate representation in an election over states like California. Or states like Vermont are given unfair representation over states like Texas. It goes both ways. The electoral college system is one I would definitely like to see collapse. Because that\u2019s part and parcel why our elections are poorly represented. Because voters in predominately red or blue states just don\u2019t feel the need to vote, because either their vote isn\u2019t needed (as the state always votes in their favor), or their vote won\u2019t matter (as the state always votes against their beliefs). \n\nBut far right ideologies and facism are on the rise everywhere. Not just the US. This should be troubling to everyone. Not just people who want to blame the US for everything. \n\nJust know that there are a lot of Americans who simply want to go to work, raise their families, be good, normal people, and then have a couple of beers on the weekend. \n\nBut that frustration and ire you\u2019re feeling? Yeah, a lot of us are feeling that too.",

You throw your hands up INSTANTLY and give up without offering any resistance or any effort at all. Go \"Well there's nothing I can do myself to change everything so therefore it isn't worth it at all.\" \n\n> What can I, as a single voter, do to disrupt the electoral college system?\n\nSo fucking much. Mainly you could stop whining, engage with other people, form collectives and DO SHIT instead of complaining? So like, oh I dunno, forming protests? Actually engaging with the political process instead of just saying \"It broken\" and not bother? Try actually talking to other people outside of your echo chamber? Try and convince other people with the same mindset to do stuff? \n\nYou all just go \"THE RICH ARE THE PROBLEM\" and basically give up because ***none of you care about anything other than yourself.*** Wanna know how I know that? Because your entire comment was you talking about yourself when I spent my entire comment talking about a **collective.** \n\nMy issue is that people as a whole don't do anything and then you give me a bunch of excuses but the thing is I don't remember seeing anyone ***even fucking try.*** You give up before you start. You go \"Well, it aint gonna work\" and don't bother. Apathy and laziness runs so rampant within the country. You just go \"Well, I cannot do anything as one person. The only people who can are those who have money. Ergo, there is no point.\" When it should be more like \"We as single individuals have no voice in comparison but we are much louder when talking together.\"\n\nYou all seperate and run off into your own little rooms and echo chambers. You DON'T. TRY. TO. DO. ANYTHING. You don't try to convince people one way or another, you just get snarky towards people or angry at them for what they think and then entrench yourselves further and make a wider divide. \n\n> I didn\u2019t prove your point, I just don\u2019t think you totally understand the nuance of our system. \n\nNo. I completely understand it. **You don't.** You're too blinded by apathy. \n\n> If you\u2019re implying that i should go stockpile guns, shoot everyone who opposes my views or go build bombs in my basement, that will do nothing.\n\nJesus christ. Only an American would hear a call to action and then immediately assume that I'm implying physical violence.\n\nThere is ***no hope for you*** until you bother to help yourselves. Wanna know how? We've been saying it for years and I've been saying it in this comment thread. If you can't see it then yeah. There really is no hope for you and you all do completely deserve what you've gotten.",

I\u2019m a CS PhD dropout, so I love this topic.\n\nIf you reduce a computer to its core calculative and logical function as a digital device, the premier argument actually goes to a device called the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (colloquially ABC) that was invented at Iowa State University. It\u2019s essentially the first copy of the unit that now forms the functional core of every modern CPU.\n\nThat said, Turing pioneered a relatively dense concept at the intersection of mathematical logic and information theory called \u201cTuring Completeness\u201d, which is a set of three macro-criteria that define a conceptual device called a Turing Machine. We call a computing device Turing-complete if it\u2019s asymptotically equivalent to a Turing machine in replicability. No computer is *actually* Turing-complete, since they all have limited memory, but that\u2019s why we use asymptotic equivalence; it\u2019s the \u201cIt *would* be like this if it had infinite memory\u201d approach.\n\nAnyway, the ABC wasn\u2019t programmable, so it couldn\u2019t necessarily replicate the functions of any other asymptotically Turing-complete device, so some folks discount it as the first computer. The device you\u2019re thinking of was Turing\u2019s Bombe device from the late 30s, which was essentially just a special-purpose machine; it was even further from Turing-complete than the ABC.\u00a0\n\nThe device that you\u2019re probably thinking of, which Turing seems to often get erroneous credit for inventing, was the UK\u2019s Colossus machine that they developed in WW2 and that Turing used. It was actually designed by a British man named Max Newman and then implemented by a *really* interesting Brit named Tommy Flowers.\n\nThe first device to be completed as a Turing-complete implementation was Konrad Zuse\u2019s Z3 that he built in his parents\u2019 spare bedroom a few years before the Colossus was functional, but that the German government decided wasn\u2019t going to be useful to the war effort. Terribly ironic.\n\nSo you could definitely say that the Brits developed the first industrial-scale computer, but saying that Turing did more toward the invention/development of the computer than anyone else is a pretty serious stretch. He was a brilliant, pioneering computer scientist, but he\u2019s certainly behind at least a couple of other Brits, Americans, and a German in contributions toward the invention/development of the computer.",

Trump made the announcement after the 2017 slate of honorees was announced. One of them, Norman Lear, said that while he would attend, he would skip the pre-ceremony reception at the White House in protest of the president\u2019s proposed cuts in arts funding. Other honorees followed in their pledges to boycott the event\n\nNorman Lear was a screenwriter and producer ; responsible for sitcoms like jeffersons, sanford and son etc, who got Kennedy Center Honors in 2017\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Lear\n\nSo this time around, Trump is looking to pack the board of trustees presumably so that the Norman Lears of tomorrow don't get honored and cause Trump such an embarassment",
