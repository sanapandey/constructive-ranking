            "body": "Answer: Lots of moving parts here. \n\n* Indigenous remains have been treated as property rather than human remains in lots of places, and Australia has a pretty rough history in particular. Some of the last native Tasmanians/Torres Strait Islanders (this status is complicated, but close enough) had their bodies desecrated in pretty horrific ways for science. \"King Billy\" was dug up and dismembered for study, Truganini demanded a cremation but was instead also dug up and stuck in a museum like an animal on display, for a hundred years. So, partially, the AUS gov't is trying to make up for the really egregious sins of the past, and tribal entities want to make it VERY FUCKING CLEAR that their bodies don't belong to anyone but them. \n* AUS also has an unusual history when it comes to the legal status of its indigenous folks. The official policy was for years that Australia was *terra nullius*, \"empty country.\" The Empire just took the attitude that Aborigines did not exist and therefore had no rights. This lasted until 1992, with the Mabo decision, at which point tribal entities began being able to fight for recognition of their ancestral lands. Removal of indigenous artefacts and bodies for scientific study feels, to a lot of indigenous folks, like additional attempts to erase them and deny them rights. In this case, it's removing evidence that they've been there for 40,000 years, and removing connection to their history.\n* I don't know enough about the current science to say if we could still learn more from the bodies. Schmaybe.\n* In this particular case, the relevant elders said, \"Hey, give us back the bodies of our people,\" the AUS gov't said, \"Okay,\" then didn't do so immediately, instead putting them into storage. Then the AUS gov't never got around to deciding whether they cared enough to store the remains in a way they could still be accessed, so the tribal bodies decided enough was enough and just buried them.",

            "body": "Answer:\n\nIndigenous communities in Australia tend to treat death, the necessary rituals and the respect given to remains **very seriously.** Exactly what this looks like differs across groups - there are several hundred, these two bodies were found on the land of the Mutthi Mutthi people - but it\u2019s enormously important to the vast majority of indigenous people that the \u201csorry business\u201d of death and mourning be honoured.\n\nThe Mutthi Mutthi people have a continuous presence in and connection to that place that IS, in fact, 40,000 years old. It may be older.\n\nThis means that remains get returned and interred, and any more recent finds are studied as much as possible in situ - if it can be studied without being moved, it is. They\u2019re family, and they want to do it right.   \n\n\nIf it were your grandmother\u2019s body, you would.",

If these remains proved to be a different people it would show current Aboriginals conquered and displaced them. Similar incidents have happened with Maori people in New Zealand\n\nThe Aboriginal claim these remains are Aboriginal (no evidence to the contrary, nor to it's favour) and they demand the bodies are treated with respect which in their case means reburying them",
