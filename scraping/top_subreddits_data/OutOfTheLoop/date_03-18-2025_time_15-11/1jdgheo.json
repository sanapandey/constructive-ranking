Right-wing politics typically involves attacking labor power and any organizations that aren't part of the state, which serves as a useful counterbalance to the \"people's power\" that communism strives for. \n\nNow, the \"[Imperial Boomerang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_boomerang?wprov=sfla1)\" has returned to the US, and the intelligence agencies are being dismantled by the same kind of people that they propped up for decades.

This is nothing like the America that was theoretically promised. The only patriotism I feel is toward the ideal of inclusion and equality that was denied over and over under our governing body. But we don\u2019t need to be born on the same side of a geopolitical border to share the same vision for humanity. \n\nThe U.S. has been historically dreadful at its treatment of immigrants, from Chinese exclusion to Japanese internment and plenty of other heinous policies. So it\u2019s scary to think our own government might want to kill/enslave us while other countries slam the door shut on Americans by virtue of being associated with the bigotry of others \u2014 *if* they decide to practice even a modicum of what the U.S. has done to others over its lifespan. And people have vastly different opinions on letting Americans into their spaces. Most of us aren\u2019t good tourists on the whole, after all. Other nations could have a fairly rational interest in not letting us join, though it would be a humanitarian tragedy. Bigots double shot us in the foot.\n\nAll I want to do is be productive to earn a living so I can eat snacks with my loved ones. Sigh.",

Sometimes that comes in the form of the helping far-right governments take over, such as in Guatemala or Chile. Other times, it comes in the form of providing aid and resources which heavily incentivize those countries to build their economies around fulfilling our needs. It's not always *necessarily* bad for the target countries - some of that aid funds disease prevention, for instance. But the upshot of all this is that America gets to extract a lot of resources, goods, and labor from these countries without the need to get our hands dirty with direct military intervention (though obviously we do that too sometimes).\n\nTrump and Musk seem to view the existence of these programs as charity or waste; money we're spending on other countries without getting any immediate, obvious return. They've been making huge cuts to foreign aid, disrupting intelligence programs, and isolating us from our allies. All of the mechanisms that help the U.S. maintain a global hegemony without keeping our boot on half the world's neck are basically being dismantled.\n\nSo if the current administration maintains its current course, we're likely going to see a big decline in soft power for the U.S. over the next few years. Whether that's a good or bad thing for other countries probably depends a lot on which countries - and which people in them.",

Some of their declassified programs from decades ago sound like the most unbelievable conspiracy theories; that would be laughed at if they weren\u2019t confirmed  true.  \n\n3. The CIA is supposed to be limited to foreign actions and espionage but has meddled within the US before.  Many accusations are labeled as \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d but on the other hand their literal job is to conspire so it can be difficult to draw the line between fact and fiction.  \n\n4.
