            "body": "Answer: Following his beef with Drake, Kendrick has presented himself kind of as a man of high morality who has a problem with the predators and abusers in the music industry (see his interview in Harper\u2019s Bazaar and his song Watch the party die). He especially called out Drake for this behavior. A lot of fans are now disappointed that he worked with Carti, who\u2019s confirmed to be a deadbeat father and has been arrested before for choking his pregnant girlfriend, though I don\u2019t know if it was ever proven. Now the fanbase is divided because Kendrick has worked with known abuser in the past before, and some are arguing that they are disappointed again by that, while others reference Kendrick\u2019s previous work, where he portrayed himself has a flawed man, a hypocrite and \u201cnot your savior\u201d.\n\nThe whole thing with Kanye is just him ranting again for publicity, just look at his twitter page, he\u2019s been posting a lot of unhinged stuff again in the last two days, including way too many Swastikas. I would also speculate that Kanye is jealous that Kendrick got so much positive public recognition following the beef, and when he tried to insert himself into it on Kendrick\u2019s side he pretty much got ignored, so I guess he\u2019s pissed about that too",
