            "body": "Answer: Mahmoud Khalil is an activist who was arrested for his participation in pro-Palistinian protests at Columbia University.\u00a0 By all accounts his participation was peaceful and law-abiding.\n\n\nThat's what makes this so unusual and so important - There isn't even the accusation of a crime in this case.\u00a0 Mahmoud is a legal US resident. A permanent resident, no less - a green card holder.\n\n\nAlso unusual is the way he was arrested.\u00a0 Agents, presumably ICE agents, came to his residence in plain clothes, in unmarked vehicles, and without showing a warrant, arrested him.\u00a0 they did not give their names, and even though they told his wife the name of a facility, he was not there.\u00a0 He was then taken out of state, and based on the most recent reports I'd read, he is to this day being held incommunicado, with no access to his lawyer and no way to talk to his wife.\n\n\nThat makes this a case of rendition, imprisonment, and likely eventual deportation of a lawful US resident for participating in lawful political speech, without due judicial process or oversight - and given the wording of the recently-passed Laken Riley Act, if they can do this to a lawful permanent resident, they can do this to a citizen.\n\n\nIt is not sensationalist or hyperbole to say that this case could spell the death of free speech in America.",

That's not to say it would have been a worse outcome than what we're facing now, but that is essentially where things stood.

                    "body": "You are right that this is relatively unprecedented.\n\nTo play devil\u2019s advocate, here is the case under which Mahmoud Khalil could be removed.\n\nFirst, it is possible to be denied permanent residency or immigration based affiliation with the Communist or any other totalitarian party. This is part of a broader set of laws passed by Congress to address threats to the safety and security of the United States. Its original purpose was to protect the United States against subversive activities that were considered threats to national security.\n\nIn general, any potential immigrant who is or has been a member of or affiliated with the Communist or any other totalitarian party (or subdivision or affiliate), domestic or foreign, is inadmissible. There are some exceptions, such as if the person stopped being a member at least 5 years before, or worked against communism or totalitarianism, etc.\n\nAs a permanent resident (\u201cgreen card\u201d) holder, you can also have your privileges revoked if you commit a felony or if you commit a \u201ccrime of moral turpitude\u201d (CIMT), which can be a felony **or even a misdemeanor** - just something very morally objectionable.\n\nSo while we don\u2019t know exactly what Mahmoud Khalil did, we can make some educated guesses:\n\nHe was a leader of Columbia United Apartheid Divest, a coalition of over 100 student groups at Columbia University. They organized and participated in the protests in support of Hamas\u2019s coordinated and planned attacks on October 7, 2023 that led to hundreds of dead civilians - hundreds of men, women, children, infants, and elderly being raped, tortured, killed, and hundreds more of them being taken hostage. And they declared support for it. a lot of organizations and coalition across numerous universities and college campuses in the United States also declared support for the attacks. as these were not attacks on military bases, but on a dance festival and on kibbutzes and civilian homes, this would be seen as acts of terrorism.\n\nIn the wake of student organizations announcing their support of Hamas\u2019 action of October 7, \u201c*Jews and Israelis at Columbia University were ostracized from student groups, humiliated in classrooms and subjected to verbal abuse as pro-Palestinian demonstrations shook the campus last year, and their complaints were often downplayed or ignored by school officials and faculty, the university\u2019s task force on antisemitism said in a report released Friday.*\u201d\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/campus-protests-israel-palestine-columbia-f2984f21aa38a4f637982af7b98fed5e\n\nThe coalition stormed and occupied Columbia University\u2019s Hamilton Hall in April of 2024. They vandalized the building and destroyed furniture to create barricades. They prevented other students from being able to go to classes in that building. They didn\u2019t clear out until the police were sent in.\n\nColumbia United Apartheid Divest on their own Instagram account stated on August 7, 2024, \u201c*We are Westerners fighting for the total eradication of Western civilization. We stand in full solidarity with every movement for liberation in the Global South.*\u201d\n\nAs Muslim mobs in Bangladesh demonstrated against quotas in government jobs for descendants of freedom fighters in June of 2024, they fought police and then went on to terrorize and rape and kill minority Hindus on the street, in their temples, and in their neighborhoods. In response, the Columbia United Apartheid Divest student coalition wrote, \u201c*As the movement for Palestine faces draconian censorship and counter-insurgency in the [United] States, we must learn from our comrades in Bangladesh and continue to escalate until the [American] empire crumbles.*\u201d\n\nIn October of 2024, even the New York Times reported: \u201c*The pro-Palestinian group that sparked the student encampment movement at Columbia University in response to the Israel-Hamas war is becoming more hard-line in its rhetoric, openly supporting militant groups fighting Israel and rescinding an apology it made after one of its members said the school was lucky he wasn\u2019t out killing Zionists.*\u201d\n\n\u201c*\u2019We support liberation by any means necessary, including armed resistance,\u2019 the group, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, said in its statement revoking the apology.*\n\n\u201c*The group marked the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by distributing a newspaper with a headline that used Hamas\u2019s name for it: \u2018One Year Since Al-Aqsa Flood, Revolution Until Victory,\u2019 it read, over a picture of Hamas fighters breaching the security fence to Israel. And the group posted an essay calling the attack a \u2018moral, military and political victory\u2019 and quoting Ismail Haniyeh, the assassinated former political leader of Hamas.*\u201d\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/nyregion/columbia-pro-palestinian-group-hamas.html\n\nKeep in mind that Hamas was designated a foreign terrorist organization since October of 1997. So supporting Hamas\u2019s violence can be considered support for a terrorist act.\n\nTake a look at this part of the State Department\u2019s **Foreign Affairs Manual** (FAM), a guide for U.S. consular officials, which predates the current administration. The section is on \u201cinegibilities based on terrorism-related grounds\u201d.\n\n\u201c*(U) INA 212(a)(3)(B)(i) renders ineligible any applicant who:*\n\n\u201c*\u2026you know, or have reason to believe, is engaged in or is likely to engage after entry in any terrorist activity*\u201d\n\n\u201c*\u2026is a representative of: a terrorist organization\u2026*\u201d\n\n\u201c*\u2026is a representative of: a political, social, or other group that endorses or espouses terrorist activity\u2026*\u201d\n\n\u201c*\u2026endorses or espouses terrorist activity or persuades others to endorse or espouse terrorist activity or support a terrorist organization\u2026*\u201d\n\nThe document further provides a background on how the definition of terrorism and terrorist activities, and the support thereof, has been widened, especially in the post-9/11 PATRIOT Act, etc.\n\nhttps://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM030206.html\n\nBut keep in mind, it may be still be difficult to remove Mahmoud Khalil using the reasons listed above.\n\nInstead, there maybe an \u201ceasier\u201d way.\n\nUnder section 237(a)(4)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, any alien can be deported \u201c*whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have POTENTIALLY [my capitalization] serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States*\u201d.\n\n(Side Note: Permanent residents are still legally considered aliens, and in fact the \u201cgreen card\u201d (later pink) had the words \u201cResident Alien\u201d very prominently displayed on the \u201cgreen card\u201d until 1997. I know, since I had one when I legally immigrated in the 1980s. Also note that everyone called the pink card a \u201cgreen card\u201d from when it was green before the change to pink.)\n\nBack in 1995, a former deputy attorney general of Mexico was deported for not declaring $26,000 in cash, because:\n\n\u201c*under section 241(a)(4)(C)(i) of the INA, the pre-1996 precursor to section 237(a)(4)(C)(i).*\n\n\u201c*That charge was based on a determination by then-Secretary of State Warren Christopher that a failure to send Ruiz-Massieu back home:*\n\n\u201c*\u2026would jeopardize our ability to work with Mexico on law enforcement matters. It might also cast a potentially chilling effect on other issues our two governments are addressing. \u2026Should the U.S. Government not return Mr. Ruiz Massieu to Mexico, our support of such reforms [of the Mexican judicial system] would be seen as hollow and self-serving and would be a major setback for President Zedillo and our combined efforts to chart a new and effective course of U.S.-Mexican relations.*\u201d\n\nIt was appealed, but the Board of Immigration Appeals determined: \u201c*A letter from the Secretary of State conveying the Secretary\u2019s determination that an alien\u2019s presence in this country would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States, and stating facially reasonable and bona fide reasons for that determination, is presumptive and sufficient evidence that the alien is deportable under section 241(a)(4)(C)(i) of the Act, and the Service is not required to present additional evidence of deportability.*\n\nhttps://cis.org/Arthur/ICE-Arrests-Palestinian-Activist\n\n(Side Note: this deportation occurred under Bill Clinton, and yes, Secretary of State Warren is the same Warren Christopher of the Christopher Commission that investigated the video-taped beating of Rodney King beating by the officers Los Angeles Police Department.)\n\nThat is why you\u2019ll notice that the remarks and statements from the current administration specifically refer to the arrest and detention of Mahmoud Khalil as under the authority of the State Department, and not under Homeland Security nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nSo while the opposition is focusing on the free speech and due process aspects, the focus of the current administration is on existing laws that already in place. While an American citizen can join the American Communist Party, for example, being a member of a communist party is grounds for denial of entry. While an American citizen can call for the destruction of the United States or verbally support the terrorist actions of Hamas, support for such actions are grounds for denial of immigration. So it is important to keep that in mind free speech is not absolute - especially for aliens. And we are about to find out what the judicial system will say.",

Where is that unclear to you?)  \n\nThis bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to detain certain non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) who have been arrested for burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting. The bill also authorizes states to sue the federal government for decisions or alleged failures related to immigration enforcement.\n\nUnder this bill, DHS must detain an individual who (1) is unlawfully present in the United States or did not possess the necessary documents when applying for admission; and (2) has been charged with, arrested for, convicted of, or admits to having committed acts that constitute the essential elements of burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting.\n\nAny non citizen can be deported on national security ground or international reputation based ground. It is 100% legal and no crime is required to be committed. Is it unusual? Yes, pretending there isn\u2019t justification or legal precedent is a bold lie to manipulate people. Say you disagree with the interpretation do not intentionally withhold the legislation at issue to create a deliberately false demonstrative. \n\nNote: one does not need to support any of trumps decisions or the actions of his puppet congress to acknowledge facts.",

They do not need to be charged with any crimes, just breaking the law is enough.\n\nAlso he was a part of a violent riot that took hostages, and a supporter of a terrorist group that has the stated goal of exterminating the jews in Israel.\n\nYou people don't get to call everything a protest. The protest ceases to be a protest when it turns violent. He is by all rights a terrorist supporting foreigner who had a large part in a violent riot that made national news, and he is being deported as such.",

Please show me the law that states that people who participate in protests should be deported. Hurting your feelings is not illegal!\n\nI agree with you on one thing, the pro-Israel students should be deported, because they are terrorists who attacked people with chemical weapons and acted violently, so they are indeed terrorists who do not belong on the US.\n\nThe peaceful pro-Palestine protestors still should not be deported though, because graffiti might hurt your feelings, but it\u2019s not an act of terrorism. \n\nA fictional kidnapping is not a crime either, because it\u2019s fictional, just like the beheaded babies. Unlike the chemical weapons attack that was actually investigated and they were found guilty.\n\nThanks for agreeing with me that the Israeli and pro-Israeli students who committed these violent acts are terrorists and should be deported though; glad we found some common ground!",

They literally swear an oath to do what the Constitution says to do and one thing it says that the executive must do is not openly disregard the rulings of the judicial.\n\nThe executive taking an unprecedented action of which the constitutionality has not been ruled does not indict the constitution because the constitution can't possibly account for every possible situation ever conceived.  But once the court rules and establishes precedent the rule of law states that the executive must heed it.  \n\nThis instance is not without precedent.  The executive has attempted to detain and deport green-card holders for \"unlawful demonstration\" and attempted to do so without due process in the past and the Supreme Court ruled that they cannot do so.  That a green-card holder is beholden only to the same laws as citizens and that the executive must apply the same due process to green-card holders that they would apply to citizens.\n\nThe executive arresting a green card holder for engaging in a lawful protest and holding him without arraignment, preliminary, or trial and attempting to deport him IS unconstitutional and their doing so is therefore an indictment OF the constitution which is the one thing they are sworn to NOT do.",

Perhaps I should have been more clear in my comment.\n\nJust because he hasn\u2019t been charged with a crime doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s innocent.

Khalil holds a green card, which comes with more protections than say someone who overstays their visa, Rubio just instructed ICE to ignore that and to just ignore those protections. He hasn\u2019t been charged with ANY crime. He is married to a US citizen. His only alleged crime is being a part of the Columbia University Palestine protests, AND BROKE NO RULES. It\u2019s a trampling of the First Amendment and the fundamental right to free speech and free protest. If you haven\u2019t seen any discourse on Israel/Palestine, all Israel critics have been shut down by crying anti Semitism over and over even when it wasn\u2019t there to justify Israel\u2019s collective punishment on the people of Palestine, which is considered a war crime by all reputable international human rights organizations. It\u2019s their trump card, no matter how ludicrous in application. And Donald Trump and his gestapo basically used that argument and are trying to deport Khalil while also using dirty tricks like relocating him from New York City to a detention center all the way down in LOUISIANA, roughly 1,000 miles away from where he was detained for the purpose of getting more conservative leaning judges to rule in favor of deportation and to separate Khalil from his lawyer and his family.\n\nKhalil is being made an example of, and even if you don\u2019t agree with his cause, you should be worried because you are next. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re white, if you\u2019re a man, if you support Israel\u2019s alleged war crimes, or if you voted Trump three times. One of these days, they will create some arbitrary rule like no porn, or no alcohol, or something equally insane, and if you don\u2019t go along with it, you will be an enemy of the state.\n\n*First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out\u2014because I was not a socialist.*\n\n*Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out\u2014because I was not a trade unionist.*\n\n*Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out\u2014because I was not a Jew.*\n\n*Then they came for me\u2014and there was no one left to speak for me.*\n\n\u2014Martin Niem\u00f6ller. 1946",

Do you think anyone who flies a confederate flag should be given the same treatment? Don\u2019t act like the confederacy wasn\u2019t a hostile entity that\u2019s primary goal was to sustain slavery which also fought against the union in the civil war, you know, killing people? Do you think that someone who dresses in a confederate uniform is supporting a terrorist organization? How about that group of neo nazis a couple weeks ago in Cincinnati? Surly you would agree that a group of people collecting on the road with nazi flags and dressed in neo nazi attire would be supporting terrorism? Something tells me you don\u2019t, because your view on this matter is not motivated by a desire to uphold the law, it is driven by your preconceived notion that any support for Palestinians or any criticism against Zionism is something to be quelled. I challenge you to honestly come up with a reasonable response to the examples I provided.",

            "body": "Answer: The US Federal government is choosing to use fear rather than policy to achieve its goals.  Perhaps the debacle aims to weaken the FBI and CIA.\n\nYou can search online to see that illegal border crossings into the US are way down since the November election, and learn that this is happening **mostly** not because of how the Federal government is actually behaving differently but because of what people *worry* that the Federal government might do.\n\nThis is similar.  There is legal wiggle-room (due to historical precedents) and a very slim chance that SCOTUS would agree that the holder of a green card does not have free speech protected the same way a US citizen does.  But that decision is really unlikely, and it would be bad for the US if that decision was made.  So we are seeing the Federal government make an action it expects will be overturned **merely** to make non-citizens *worry* about being anywhere near criminal protest.\n\nThere are pros and cons of using fear instead of policy.  In the short term a climate of fear is unhealthy for society.  In the short term, using fear allows a government to look active and significant while actually devoting very few resources.  In the long term, once a new administration is in power they can reverse a climate of fear more easily than reversing policy.  In the long term having society discuss issues such as \"what type of involvement should count legally as being an accessory to criminal protest?\" might help create better policy decisions.\n\nTangential is how the administration's current efforts to increase Federalism in education.  (I use the word **Federalism** to describe a desire to shift authority from the Federal government to the state governments.)  Trump likes Federalism: look at his policies about regulations, and what happened during his previous term with abortion.  Trump also believes the FBI and CIA are in some way his enemies.  Currently the five-year anniversary of the US COVID lockdowns are prompting articles ([example](https://archive.is/PjdV9)) critical of Federal over-reach that make the *timing* of the Mahmoud Khalil debacle so terrible that a reasonable person could wonder if an *intended* consequence is increasing Federalism for policing, to weaken public support for the FBI and CIA.  (That would normally seem like a conspiracy theory to me, because no one has actually suggested how state policing could or should replace what the FBI and CIA does.  But in this case I won't categorize \"Trump getting revenge on those whom he perceives as having hurt him, without working through all the consequences\" as a conspiracy theory because it fits his established patterns of behavior.)",

Many people who are upset about this view it as an infringement on freedom of speech and due process. Additionally, the way he was detained was unusual and caused some to believe this is a gestapo style detainment.\n\nMahmoud is a greencard holder which is a privilege not a right and like any other privilege it can be revoked with or without reason at any time prior to naturalization. A greencard holder does not have the same rights and protections as an American citizen. Committing crimes is the easiest way to lose this status. In the event the federal government decides to revoke green card status, it would be ICE who would be responsible for detaining the greencard holder and this would happen without a warrant or due process.\n\nContrary to popular belief, freedom of speech is not unlimited. It is a federal crime in the US to provide resources or support for any designated terrorist organization. In this case, HAMAS has been designated as a terrorist organization since 1997 and Mahmoud was on video chanting support for them and screaming \"death to America\".\n\nAlthough the US is well within its rights to deny him due process, I do think Mahmoud will have his day in court. That being said, given the video evidence and the landscape in the US these days, I believe he will ultimately lose.",

The link to the USCIS website you provided says the same (\"As a permanent resident (Green Card holder), you have the right to: ... Be protected by all laws of the United States\"). Here is some case law anyway:  *Zadvydas v. Davis*, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001) (holding that due process applies to all aliens in the United States, even those whose presence is unlawful); *Ferreras v. Ashcroft*, 160 F. Supp. 2d 617, 629 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (holding that even aliens who have not achieved legal permanent resident status are entitled to protection under the  Fifth Amendment's due process clause); *Yick Wo v. Hopkins*, 118 U.S. 356, 369 (1886) (the Equal Protection Clause is \"universal in its application to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction, without regard to differences of ... nationality.\"); *Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding*, 344 U.S. 590, 598 (1953) (Neither the First nor Fifth Amendments \\[free speech & due process\\] \"acknowledge any distinction between citizens and resident aliens.\")  \n  \nThe fact that the government must follow a legal process to revoke a green card or deport someone is also not disputed--the government is following that process here (they already issued him the required Notice to Appear in immigration court.) The procedures the government must follow are outlined in the Immigration and Nationality act (see sections 1533, 2391(a)(1), and related regulations). The green card holder has the right to be represented by counsel (not for free) at these proceedings. INA 240(4)(a). Under the specific provision the administration is using here, the gov has the burden to prove by \"clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence\" that the Secretary of State has set forth a \"facially reasonable and bona fide basis\" for his determination. *Matter of Ruiz-Massieu*, 22 I&N Dec 833 (BIA 1999).\n\nIn addition to a plain text reading of the statute, the fact that handing out flyers (even explicitly in support of a terrorist group) does not fall within the definition of \"providing material support\" for terrorist organizations can be found in the Supreme Court case of *Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project*, 561 U.S. 1, XX (2010) (holding that the statute \"makes clear\" that it does not cover \"independently advocating for a cause\" and that \"material support\" typically \"does not take the form of speech and when it does, the statute is carefully drawn to cover only a narrow category of speech to, under the direction of ... \\[terrorist\\] groups\\[.\\]\"). And finally, the Supreme Court has long recognized that the First Amendment prohibits government officials (including Marco Rubio) from retaliating against individuals for exercising their First Amendment rights. *See*, *e.g*., *Hartman v. Moore*, 547 U.S. 250, 256 (2006). Judicial review of a First Amendment retaliation claim is guaranteed by court precedent and the civil habeas statute, 28 USC 2241.",
