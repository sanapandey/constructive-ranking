Polls should not be taken to heart unless they show their sample pool, since they tend to extrapolate upwards severely. A poll should be used a guideline and also compared to a multitude of others to get an in general grasp of on-goings, especially when compared to news articles and your own personal real world experiences.",

For the US population, if you surveyed 2400 people in a representative way, you'd be 95% confident whatever result you got was within +-2% of the real value.",

You want to know the opinion of those Ds and Rs in that region, but you want to maybe slant it in your views favors. So you choose to have 100 people polled, and you'll extrapolate from that, but skew it so that you favor one side over the other. So you poll 70 Democrats and 30 Republicans. Say you ask them if they favored X, Y, and Z yet only 5 Democrats say YAY and 28 Republicans say YAY. Well 28/30 is 93% of the Republicans while 5/70 is only 7% of the Democrats.\n\n  \nBasically without knowing the exact details of every single poll, the area they're in, and how they're projecting this data onto large populations, we shouldn't take them as absolutes.",

It was 52% of people who answered that poll. If you polled the audience after a Taylor Swift concert you could say \"99% of Americans say that Taylor Swift is the best artist of all time and should be Queen of the World\". \n\nSo the telephone game happens and people just hear \"60% of people approve of DOGE\" then repost it when in reality they just polled a group of fist bumping frat bros standing outside a Trump rally. \n\nThe true sickening and dangerous thing is how flippantly and confidently the actual administration will quote these polls.",

            "body": "Answer: The US is very politically divided right-now so any polls you see in the main stream media and going to be extremely biased one way or the other. There's also been a lot of cherry picking of data.\n\nThe 76% number that's going around has been taken out of context.\n\n76% of Americans see tackling fraud and waste in government as important. That's not really surprising, and arguably a good thing on either side of the aisle.\n\nTaking this poll number to mean they all support DOGE and its actions is a significant stretch.\n\nOther polls show upwards of 60% of Americans are concerned about DOGE and its current actions, but these polls are from left-wing sources.\n\nThe original poll was from February, and seems to use data from October as well. As time goes forward the number of people concerned about DOGE and its actions appears to be increasing.\n\nIt's hard to get to the facts here but what seems clear is:\n\n- The majority of Americans support the idea of tackling government waste and fraud\n- Left-leaning Americans are more likely to be concerned about DOGE and its actions\n- Right-leaning Americans are more likely to support DOGE and its actions\n\nRight-wing media is pushing the narrative that there is wide spread fraud and waste in government and many are actively cheering laying off government workers they see as holding 'pointless jobs'. They are also taking whatever Elon posts on Twitter at face value rather than digging into the facts.\n\nIt's important to note that the Right-leaning Wall Street Journal was the first to breakdown and expose the DOGE ledger of savings as being most fraudulent or misrepresented.\n\nThe reality is the consequences of what DOGE is doing won't be fully felt for at least 6 months to a year and by then Musk will likely be long gone.",
