    "selftext": "[Why are people protesting at Tesla dealerships](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/hundreds-protest-tesla-showrooms-over-musk-s-doge-work/ar-AA1B2s9i) instead of at capitols, town halls, or the offices of their elected representatives?\n\nWouldn't it be more effective to put pressure on the people who could make changes?  Is it because they're in smaller towns more distant from state capitols?  Do they feel safer protesting at a car dealership than anywhere else?\n\nI don't live in the US so I'm seeing this on social media and US-based news, which admittedly may be ignoring those types of protests instead of ones at Tesla.\n\nHey mods, why do I have to use something like \"what's up with\" or \"what's the deal\" in the title instead of a plain question such as \"Why are people...?\"  *neurospicy confusion*",

That is a different impact from protesting at government facilities and events.  Many of the republicans have dismissed those protestors as being paid by Soros so they have deliberately said they will ignore them.  While elections have consequences, none of the federal positions are up for election until late next year.  \n\nTesla stock however is business.  It skyrocketed around the election and doubled.  It has taken a beating and has lost all those gains.  I don't know much about how he does his finances, but his much touted net worth is largely tied to Tesla stock, some of which is collateral for loans when he bought twitter.  I don't know where this is headed, but things can get painful for him eventually.",

As they don't pay federal income tax on loans but can use the money in the same way as income.  \n\nAlthough Musk tried and failed to get about a $60 billion one year salary from Tesla.

Then the people he borrowed the money from, can force the sale of his shares to pay them back.   A so called Margin Call.  That sell off could then cause a positive feedback loop.  Where the more he sells the more the share price drops, so that other loans that he has then call in their margin calls, prompting more sell offs, causing the stock to fall further......\n\nSome of the money that he used to buy Twitter, was based on loans secured against Tesla shares.  Initially it all was going to be but then he switched to getting other people to join in and using cash.  But people hope that if the Tesla share price crashes enough, then he'll be forced to sell his share of Twitter.  \n\nAnonymous, the Internet hacktivist group, claims based on anonymous sources.

VOTE YOU OUT!\" as their Republican rep retreated. These Republicans are getting booed and jeered and laughed at when they lie during these town halls. Some Republicans are publicly claiming that protesters and upset constituents at town halls are just paid actors or Democrats, but I don't think any of them is stupid enough to actually believe that. The Republican establishment has recommended they stop having in-person town halls at all, because their own voters are so disgusted with them.

They are protesting specifically at Tesla dealerships to block or shame people supporting Tesla and therefore Musk.\n\n>I don't live in the US so I'm seeing this on social media and US-based news, which admittedly may be ignoring those types of protests instead of ones at Tesla.\n\nThe protests are mostly being covered on local news, with infrequent mentions on larger scale news sites. National level news sites are often owned by large companies/wealthy individuals and are either intentionally suppressing or just unable to adequately relay the sheer amount of protests happening nationwide right now.",

No, I dont expect this to be the one thing that makes a difference, nor do I expect any positive change to come quickly.\n\nYou seem like one of those people who are always going to look for reasons to dismiss any kind of protest. This is very common, unfortunately, among Americans. We have been trained to think this way. If you think we should give up on a boycott after only a few weeks because it didn't have the desired outcome fast enough, then you frankly haven't spent enough time learning about how the world works. It was never going to be that easy. Buckle up, because we have a very rough road ahead of us.\n\nFor one, dont expect any one form of protest to be the end-all be-all. Its going to take organized effort on the part of many many Americans trying many different things. Dont let perfect be the enemy of good. As long as it impedes the neo-monarchist revolution, it is useful to do. That could mean showing up to a peaceful demonstration, it could also mean doing things like clogging up ICE tiplines with false reports, starting community food banks to subvert the need of government assistance, and even enforcing the boycott of a potential dictators main source of income through coercive property damage.\n\nMusk is not going to fold easily, nor is Trump or anyone in that circle. They are way to deep at this point. We must apply constant pressure in every possible way and at every possible moment to keep this group weak. That includes attacking Elon's wallet. It includes a lot of things, killing Tesla is only one single piece, and it's only the start. Now is not the time to roll over and concede on anything.",

While nearly half the population didn't vote for Trump, and a fair number of Trump supporters are changing their mind about him, literally nobody voted for Elon Musk. So, to have him taking power from the people, firing hundreds of thousands of federal workers, demanding cuts to social security and medicaid, and just overall interfering with government irresponsibly is a bigger affront than an elected leader making decisions they disagree with.",

Elon has been making people lose their jobs and if you take away someone's job it's pretty easy to get them to turn on said person. Protesting Trump's \"policies\" does very little to change peoples minds who support him. But we have seen many Republicans and Democrats come together to protest Elon. Elon and Trump are basically linked together in people's minds now. So you start with the common ground of Elon being terrible and corrupt for the government and hopefully along the way it gets people to also realize how completely corrupt the entire administration is.",
