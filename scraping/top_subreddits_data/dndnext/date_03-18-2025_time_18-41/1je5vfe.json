    "selftext": "One of my players recently asked to join a secret order that worships an ancient god of agony and pain. Inspired by flagellant sects and mysterious cults, this order has multiple initiation levels, each with painful trials and intriguing benefits. From blinding yourself in combat to marking your body with a sacred symbol, the trials test both the body and mind. But with each trial comes power and rewards.\n\nI break down the first and second levels of initiation, explaining the trials and their benefits, and how to incorporate these dark and mysterious elements into your own campaigns. If you're interested in dark cults, secret religions, or eerie organizations, this article might inspire your next adventure!\n\n[https://bocoloid.blogspot.com/2025/03/mr-gm-guide-me-into-cult-of-agony.html](https://bocoloid.blogspot.com/2025/03/mr-gm-guide-me-into-cult-of-agony.html)",
