And that loot goblin has very simple needs..... they want loot!  \nThis booklet contains loot tables for each monster introduced in the Quests from the Infinite Staircase module, along with a simple method of determining what loot is received. This loot is much more than \"The Android was carrying 7 ep and 2 pp\". Instead, you can take parts from that Android and make them into new and existing magic items!\n\n[The Loot Goblin's Guide to Quests from the Infinite Staircase](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/515665/The-Loot-Goblins-Guide-to-Quests-from-the-Infinite-Staircase)\n\nHappy Looting!",
