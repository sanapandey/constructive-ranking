    "selftext": "Hi. I am a relatively new dm and I have trouble when it comes to making adventures/campaigns/quests. I wrote an adventure for my players a couple weeks back and they really enjoyed it but now I am stumbled on what I should write next. Here\u2019s some backstory on session 1\n-a thieves guild stole gold from a bank and is keeping it in a secret hide out\n-players receive a quest to find and return the banks security wizard back to his house\n-players find the wizard\n-players return the wizard.\n\nAfter they have done all of that I am now confused on what should I add next. All I have in mind is make a spying quest for the players on snow giants that were used to transport the gold into a secret mine. ",

            "body": "Homebrewing your first-ever campaign is TOUGH. I agree with u/DarkHorseAsh111 \\- I'd strongly suggest a pre-written module for your first foray into DMing. How much you allow your players to deviate / how much you're willing to supplement with homebrew is up to you - but it's ok to tell your players that since you're new you do want to stick pretty closely to the adventure module as-written just so you can get your head around DMing.",

            "body": "So, the general consensus on prepping campaigns and non-one-shot adventures is to prepare Places, Situations, and NPCs, ***not*** solutions.\n\nWhat does that mean? Well, it means that you have the problem set up, let's say children are disappearing from their homes in the middle of the night. Relevant NPCs might include the town elders (righteous, stuck-up bunch), any religious leaders in the town (kind, but passive), the guard captain (caught between elders and religious leaders), and the goblin party that are taking the children away. There's also the question of *why* this is happening, and that would be that the goblins feel slighted by the encroaching expansion of the town's farmland into their nearby woodland territory, and any attempts at negotiation have been shot down by the town's elders. So, in revenge, the goblins have been kidnapping the kids until the elders take notice and are willing to negotiate. The Places where all this happens are the Town (I would also select a couple buildings like the temple, tavern, and town hall), the nearby woodland, and the Goblin Camp.\n\nNow what? Well, you have all the elements in front of you, now drop the PCs in there and see what happens. All the NPCs have their own goals and desires, and the PCs must navigate that to a solution they deem appropriate. This could mean they broker a peace deal between the two groups. Or maybe they kill all the goblins and rescue the kids that way. Or maybe they side with the goblins and raze the town! But ultimately, you don't know how they're going to attempt to resolve this, so preparing a solution is less than ideal, and preparing for *all* possibilities is also too much work.\n\nNow that, obviously, is a bit simplistic of a storyline, but the same process can be expanded for most, if not all, storylines. I would also highly suggest looking at [Worlds Without Number](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/348809/worlds-without-number-free-edition), as it has a plethora of GM tools designed to help with this exact sort of thing. Yes, there are some TTRPG system rules at the front of the book, but the GM tools are system agnostic, and are honestly amazing. Plus it's free, so there's really no reason not to look at them.",

Like, if they want to go to another town, set up an ambush by bandits and hey, there's a treasure map in their camp. They go for the treasure and hey, it's actually cursed. So they need to un-curse it and the mage who could do it asks a favor... and so on.",
