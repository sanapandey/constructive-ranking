I didn't know for a while, read the raw rules, and thought it was the dumbest thing I've ever read. And I disagree with a lot of points in the raw rules - mostly because they feel written to counteract abuse where as my players tend to competly forget about resources they have and use little strategy.\n\nIn world in my campaign Scrolls are single use consumables designed to be easy to use. If I had a party memeber with the ability to make them maybe I'd consider some restrictions , but otherwise I don't even understand why they are limited. Unless you have a player trying to mass produce high level spells it seems pointless. Even if that happens, there, are better ways around it than limiting who can use a scroll.",

Either way it's not something I really think about after the first session if even then.

Only difference is I'd probably allow that to be considered a focus.\n\nIf a player really liked wands for whatever reason then either it's just a focus and is purely a flavor thing or same properties as a charged staff.",

In dnd losing a turn can mean not doing anything for 15 minutes assuming 4 players and a dm each taking 3 minutes per turn. So if you go down and have to be brought back up thats 15 minutes. If you then lose another turn thats 30 minutes. If you then get downed again because you couldnt move thats 45 minutes\n\n\nI get the idea of challenging, and how yoyo healing is...
