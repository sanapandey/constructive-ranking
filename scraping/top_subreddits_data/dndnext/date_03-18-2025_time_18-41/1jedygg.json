    "selftext": "Hi! About a year ago, I shared my lore document for my fantasy campaign setting, Aceon. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-rAYaD-3yPZhgK4eCGMrBR2ut_moWQlB8GIOt9w6hzU/edit\n\nI had around 15k words then, and now it\u2019s reached 50,000. I\u2019ve formatted it and very nearly completed it. I have written:\n\n- a creation myth\n\n- dozens of gods and their planes\n\n- more than 20 religious traditions \n\n- 3000 years of history for over two dozen nations and territories on a planet the size of Mars, structured in an easy-to-follow manner.\n\n- detailed explanations of the state of art, technology, science, and culture\n\n- an original calendar complete with constellations, a unique astrological system, and holidays\n\n- a chapter on plants, animals, and monsters unique to my setting\n\n- an account of the two largest cities in the world which dives into their local culture and goes district-by-district to expand on landmarks and social organization.\n\n- a hyperlinked table of contents to help navigate all of this! \n\n\nI REALLY encourage everyone to check it out and give your thoughts. I had some issues with malicious commenters the last time I posted so if you have anything to say please post it here! It\u2019s about 95% done, with 3-5k words expected to come out of this final push. I fully plan on shopping around for publishing options once it\u2019s done, so let me know if you\u2019d be interested in that.  \n\n\nThe document is meant to be viewed in its print format, where it\u2019s sized as a standard 8.5 by 5.5 inch novel layout and numbers around 250 pages with the page number in the corner. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1-rAYaD-3yPZhgK4eCGMrBR2ut_moWQlB8GIOt9w6hzU/edit\n\n\nOne final note is that I\u2019m a little unsure of how to use the OGL and what exactly is allowed, so there may be some elements which seem adapted from Forgotten Realms (because this setting is the one I run for D&D 5e games) but I\u2019ve made signifcant transformations in both name and content. The similarities may be noticeable but I think I\u2019ve made it my own. ",

They also experience large amounts of it through gameplay. I weave the history and geography stuff into gameplay pretty often, especially last campaign which was a trek through the war-torn deserts of the continent Trecothum. The next campaign will involve the astrology, calendar, and giant lore really heavily, etc. \n\nIn terms of how it relates to a novel, my next project is in fact a novella in this world, but yeah I\u2019m really just referring to length in the post.",
