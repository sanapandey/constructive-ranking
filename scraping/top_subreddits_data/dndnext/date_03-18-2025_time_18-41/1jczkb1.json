And then we\u2019re convinced a tower during a random road encounter was haunted when it\u2019s actually one of my players back story biting them. Also\nEnded up with a new trio of NPC in Phandalin who will tie into one of the player back and future post mines story if the group decides to continue past level 5. It\u2019s my second session as DM and the players are supportive, playing their characters, good to each other, and active in our discord between sessions. I am so happy and have fallen in love with the DM role. 3/4 of our session today was improv based off a random encounter that I scaled up because they got through too easy and it wasn\u2019t fun",

Any time something else comes up, he drops the game to go do that. Like the dnd game is just the placeholder until something better comes along.\n\nWe needed all hands on deck for the fight, so I ended up having to cancel the game. Next game sometime in April.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 insulting. No respect for the time and effort I put in to run this game.",

My players are normally pirates on their own ship. For the one shot they played as the crew of another pirate ship. They raided a shipwreck to recover a magic artifact. Then I revealed that crew works for the guy they suspect of being the BBEG. Now they are terrified the characters they created are going to become NPC minions they will have to face later.",

In the first room, after a boss fight, the party (4 level 8 adventurers) were attacked by 4 revenants. Upon seeing how hard they hit with each attack, the DM toned down their damage, but the fight was still one of the toughest in the campaign so far. We decided to abandon the quest for the time being and return after buying magic items in Neverwinter. The DM hadn't planned for this, so we ended the session immediately after.",

Our DM let us play out the nonsensical tragedy of performance that Endelyn wanted in the following way:\n\nEach player (we are 2) says a number between 1 and 80 and gets and random sentence, that needs to be part of our performance and fit into our script and we had 90 seconds to do it every time we get a sentence. It was incredibly fun and honestly more stressful than any possible I did so far xDDD\n\nWe did it in the end though (not perfectly, but good enough).",

They were stationed in a bathhouse, and all 3 other party members, including our leader, the Gauntlet, got massages while on work. I'm playing the Dungeon Dudes Apothacary, an intelligence based pact caster with a support focus. I'm a mad surgeon, emphasis on the mad. When the enemies showed up, my character lost it, sick of his colleagues getting massages when we're hunting down a group of murders. He went into a mad rage, swinging around his bonesaw and screaming about how he would carve them to pieces.",

It wasn't exactly a win, it was more of a \"I'm tired of this, you're going to do what I want anyway\" and then teleporting them all outside. But also, the warlock has a new patron, the self-proclaimed God of Chaos. Literally popped into the warlock's head in the middle of the fight to telepathically tell him that his old patron was \"playing dirty\" and he would give him a small, one-time loan of phenomenal cosmic power, purely to piss off his sister, and that they could \"work out the details later, I know you're busy.\"",

I went into this session feeling pretty anxious, a little sad, and curious about what comes next from that fallout. I felt like the players didn\u2019t share my shock or sadness, and I felt like this was the session where I\u2019d be saying good-bye to her. We\u2019ve all played our respective characters for a really long time and my character (Druid using optional spells from TCOE) acted as the healer of the party, bringing others back to life or buffing them up to prevent death. I felt like I save everyone else, but who\u2019s there to save me? \n\nWell, I was definitely proven wrong. There was a sense of urgency and sadness in character, and my friends expressed out of character how they\u2019ve had shower thoughts of what could have been done differently since our last session. The PCs have learned that my PC\u2019s soul was captured by our Warlock\u2019s cursed gold eye and they might be able to retrieve it from her Patron in the Hells. The PCs performed a ritual to preserve her body and each provided an offering (diamond dust, sage, a honey scoop, a lucky ring, and Rod of the Pack Keeper). Our gnome player cried when the rogue, my PC\u2019s partner, kissed my PC and assured her that he was coming to get her. It was all really sweet and I felt like my silly worries were relieved.",
