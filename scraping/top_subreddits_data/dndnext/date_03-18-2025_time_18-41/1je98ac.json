    "selftext": "This invocation seems so flavourful; it gives off magneto like vibes. \n\nMy concerns, how useful is this invocation in actual game play. I find with my warlock I like to concentrate on hour long summons spells in an attempt to get as much value from my pact slots as possible. \n\nBut I supposed by level 9 I could just levitate out of melee reach and just spam Eldritch blast and synaptic static. I don\u2019t know. \n\nHas anybody used this invocation and how did it go? ",

It's just not that great.",

Yeah, it is at will flight for small gaps and stuff like that, but at level 12 you don't really plan on a wild river to use up any ressources anyway.\n\nI am a rogue focussing on telekinesis magic and fighting with a bracer of flying daggers, so flying above everyone only makes me a target without somewhere to hide. I could levitate others, but that would waste my turn and make them immobile. We have a caster with the fly spell for that.\n\nI am still waiting for a strong melee-only enemy to cast this on, since those types get completly disabled by the spell, but they probably have high enough Con to be completly immune.\n\nMy honest review is that it is great for flavor and can be used to some effect. But it will never trivialize something that was hard before.",
