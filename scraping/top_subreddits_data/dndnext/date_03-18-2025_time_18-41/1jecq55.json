In both 2014 and 2024 edition, Prone grants advantage on attacks made within 5 feet, and Paralyzed/Unconscious grant auto-crit on attacks made within 5 feet.  \n\nIf you have some method to remove the ranged attacker disadvantage(such as spell sniper, crossbow expert, sharpshooter, or if the prone target is incapacitated), then the ranged attack will have advantage.  \n\nSome other notes: using a reach weapon on a prone target 10 feet away will have disadvantage.  \n\nYou also auto-crit Paralyzed and Unconscious targets as long as you are within 5 feet of them, even if you use a ranged weapon.",
