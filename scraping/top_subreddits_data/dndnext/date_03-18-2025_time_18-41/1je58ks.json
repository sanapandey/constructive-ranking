Most of them have ways to deal other forms of damage too, but B/P/S Resistance remains relevant to high tier play.",

            "body": "This is at 15th level, yeah? Or even higher. I'd say probably not worth it in the long run. Tough would end up giving you more HP then this would effectively. To reach 30 hit points, you'd need to save 30 hit points of damage, but the best case senario is you reduce damage by 3. \n\nThat means you have to get hit 10 times in ideal mathematical situations where all of them max their effectiveness before Tough starts losing out. (I.E 26/2 = 13 vs 21/2 round down = 10.)\n\nIt is, however, more likely that you'll be reducing your damage by 2 instead of 3 each attack, and that means 15 attacks vs 10 to reach tough effectiveness. If you can get a short rest in and reach max health, then it'll be better. If you don't think short resting will consistently get you to max health, then maybe HAM will be better.\n\nThis also presumes you'll be fighting monsters with non-magical weapons. As it's 2024, I don't think the statblocks specify magic vs non-magic anymore since it's not relevant to the system anymore, so we can hopefully say, yes all the relevant attacks will be resisted. A reprint of the subclass would also likely remove that restriction all together, allowing it to work on spells like Catapult and Blade Barrier. \n\nI suppose there's nothing stopping you from picking both Tough and HAM though. Tough is a great background feat after all, though Magic Initiate for some good ol' expeditious retreat is some great mobility for a melee fighter, so I tend to pick that one. Either that or for the shield spell.\n\nHonestly, Shield is also great at stopping so much more damage then anything else, and with the new 2024 printing, you can use your paladin spells to cast it as well. At your level though, Defensive Duelist will offer the same protection, but is resourceless. I don't know if you're a dex paladin though, which you'd need to be to use it.",
