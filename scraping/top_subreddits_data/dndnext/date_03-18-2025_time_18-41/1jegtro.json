I would also love to hear any suggestions in the comments if anyone here has any ideas for how to replicate his abilities in dnd. Thanks!\n\nEdit: My players are high level so I'm looking for tier 4 level abilities, like 27-30\n\nEdit2: I'm focusing on the end of the series (not the very end) when Deku is at the height of his power",
