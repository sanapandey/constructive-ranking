    "selftext": "According to what I read: \n\n> If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell. A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell's material components -- or to hold a spellcasting focus -- but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.\n\nDoes this mean if I\u2019m wielding a great sword I can use spells that require a free hand to use materials? \n\nI\u2019m really sorry if this is dumb. I have my first game in a few days and I\u2019m trying to be as ready as possible. ",

That is to say, holding it is but one of multiple options to use it, because the Holy Symbols, themselves, contain specific wording that lets them bypass the general rule for spellcasting with a focus. A Holy symbol worn around the neck, in 5e14, counts as being worn visibly, and thus, already satisfies the requirements to use it to replace material components; unless it's covered, of course.\n\nIn 5e24, the holy symbol can be an amulet (worn or held), an emblem (worn on cloth or a shield), or a reliquary (held only). If it's an emblem, it can be part of a cloak, robes, so on and so forth. In such a circumstance, it does not need to be held.",

It should be noted that most paladin bonus actions don't require a material component, at most a hand free which you can do basically whenever you want.\n\nThis of course gets into the rules to a level no one really cares to track so who cares?",

I still find it hard to imagine someone doing all this fluidly without giving up movement or something for it, but raw it\u2019s what it does.\n\nIt might not be classified as a drawing action but I mean in this instance it is the movement being performed in relation to the sword and the action for stowing or readying applies to the item being used in the related action, so in using an attack with a great sword you wouldn\u2019t stow a different item. \n\nI also find it hard to imagine you\u2019re going to reach into a pocket, grab a totem, cast a spell with it and then put it back while also coordinating your movements to attack with the sword, especially in six seconds. Not to mention all actions technically happen simultaneously so you\u2019re also dodging/blocking while doing this.",

You're already holding the sword. You're not drawing it, you're not stowing it, you're not sheathing it, you're not picking it up. You are already holding it, you've already done the object interaction to get it into your hand.\n\nWhether you hold something in one hand or two has *NEVER* been anything but free. If that were the case, two-handed ranged weapons simply wouldn't work, because as part of fighting with one, you are letting go, drawing an object, loading that object, and then grabbing the weapon again.\n\n> the action for stowing or readying applies to the item being used in the related action\n\nSays what? There's nowhere in the rules that suggests that what you draw or stow is something that must be used at that moment. That is an assumption.\n\nIf I'm wielding one sword, I can use the attack action, draw a sword in the other hand, and attack with the first sword; and that is completely RAW. \n\nEven in 5e14, the wording it uses in one of it's examples of a free object interaction is \"or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.\" It doesn't say \"draw the weapon you intend to attack with as part of the same action you use to attack.\" In 5e24, it just says you may draw or stow one weapon, again; it doesn't specify any conditions regarding what the weapon does after it is drawn or stowed.\n\n> I also find it hard to imagine... while doing this.\n\nThen don't. We're playing a fantasy game where a Samurai Fighter can fire a musket 18 times in 6 seconds without magical assistance, generating an amount of force that would result in an individual dislocating their own shoulder, and it's completely RAW. \n\nThe rules are rules, they don't have to make physical sense; they're just how the game works and nothing more.",

People just don't even bother to learn how spell components work half the time, so you're doing great by actually reading the rules for how your features work and seeking to understand them. \n\nSo, two-handed weapons only require two hands *while you're attacking with them*. The rest of the time, you're okay to hold your greatsword in a single hand, which leaves a free hand to do stuff with. \n\nTake a holy symbol associated with your oath, hang it around your neck. Boom, 99% of your spellcasting is good to go. For any spell that requires a material component that doesn't have a gold cost and isn't consumed, you just manipulate that holy symbol with your free hand, and that covers your material and somatic components just fine. For any spell that doesn't require material components and does require somatic components, you have an empty hand to do the somatic component with. And for spells that DO require consumed and/or costly components, just have those available on your belt, and you're free to utilize them as part of the spellcasting anyway. Casting spells is usually very easy with a two-hander. \n\nIf you end up going weapon+shield instead, things are still almost all good. You can put a holy symbol on your shield, so you're good to go for material spells that don't have a cost and aren't consumed. If you have costly spells or non-material spells, you'd then need to use your one free object interaction per turn to stow your sword before casting, which can be a bit awkward, but isn't the end of the world.",

So if you are fighting with a longbow or greatsword and decide to cast a spell you can go on holding your weapon in your right hand while you cast with your left.\n\nThat said, note that a paladin's holy symbol can be worn as an amulet or painted on a sheild, so you can usually safely go into battle with both hand full and count on being able to cast your spells.",

Rather an arbitrary choice from Crawford some months after the 2014 release because many people were wondering, that has been sanctuarized as the official RAW afterwards.\n\nConsider that a character that has enough strength when using both arms to make waves and strikes in a fast enough fashion to hit even guarded enemies, \"probably\" has enough strength in a single arm to carry it one-handed a few seconds even while moving and/or focusing on doing something else. :)",

You just need both hands free to wield it, which you can do again after you're done casting your spell. \n\nThe reason you cant do so while holding two weapons or one weapon and a shield is that you'd have to drop one of those first to cast your spell. Now you can theoretically do that but then you'd have to use an action again to pick up and equip the dropped item",

You do get a free interaction with an object which can be used to sheathe a weapon to cast a spell though, and you can draw it as part of an Attack action later (I'm using 2024 rules here) - note this means you can't make an Attack of Opportunity though.\n\nYou'll also note a lot of the Paladin's damage on Bonus Attacks only have a verbal components for this reason, which lets you use them with a 2H weapon strike.\n\nIts also worth noting that a Holy Focus can substitute for somatic and simple material components (those that arent consumed and don't have a listed cost) and that your shield can be your Holy Focus as a Paladin if you have it engraved with your holy symbol (something to talk with your DM about). So you can get past a lot of somatic/material costs as a paladin just with your shield. A shield/one-handed weapon might be a better combo then if you want to rely on your non-verbal only spells in combat.",
