    "selftext": "Working on a basic introduction to D&D that I can use to teach people the fundamentals, and I'm trying to hit the highlights of classes (with examples from common media). I'd like to sum up the idea of subclasses with a single, thematic term, and there used to be ones in the PHB but some have just defaulted to Subclass, which is boring.\n\nWizards used to have Schools, but that's changed with 5.5e. Monks had Ways and now they're Warriors. Fighters, Rangers, and Rogues all had Archetypes, but I'm trying to change things up a little bit to paint a bit more difference between the classes.\n\nHere's what I have so far:\n\nBarbarian Path  \nBard College  \nCleric Domain  \nDruid Circle  \nFighter Archetype (the old name)  \nMonk Warrior  \nPaladin Oath  \nRanger Specialization (used to be Archetype but want to be different from the Fighter)  \nRogue Profession (also used to be Archetype and Profession seems to fit Rogue well)  \nSorcerer Origin  \nWarlock Patron  \nWizard Savant (used to be School, Savant seems interesting to use)\n\nSo, Fighter, Ranger and Rogue all used Archetype. Wizards used to have Schools, but Savant is in the feature description. Any thoughts? Probably thinking too much but trying to flair things to make it as easy to differentiate between classes for new folks as possible at a glance, and don't want to re-use the same word or just say Subclass.",

For all you gain in power with Illusion, your evocation will be lacking. \n\nI don't expect that scheme to continue when WoTC release wizard subclasses that don't revolve around a school of magic, though.",

Monks aren't warriors to me, they're a divine class seeking enlightenment and one with the divine through different physical and mental practices. \"Way of the Shadow\" sounds much cooler than \"Warrior of Shadow\" to me.
