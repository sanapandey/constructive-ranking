    "selftext": "I know a this is VERY case-by-case for a lot of people, but as DM\u2019s or players, where do you personally draw the line with reusing characters? \n\nAs an extremely casual player of 8-ish years who\u2019s only recently gotten more serious about my campaigns, I\u2019ve met a lot of people with differing opinions on this. A handful of people insisted players must make characters specifically to fit into their campaign, but I\u2019ve also known a handful of others who are entirely fine with players using the same characters in multiple campaigns (obviously with stats not transferring between them). \n\nAs someone who has never actually seen the game from a DM\u2019s point of view, I\u2019ve been curious to see where other people stand on this and the pros and cons of either side",

He's too injured to be a fighter again, but he's slowly learning interesting abilities through the spirits he contacts. He was a Spirits Bard.",

For example, if you made a character for a more medieval campaign and brought them over into the sci-fi campaign, it could be fun but now you have to explain why and how they got there. It's doable, but tailored characters I find are much better. And, as always, if the DM is willing.\n\n\nFrom a DM's perspectice, one thing I personally like doing is having alternate versions of the same character. Example: I have a stat-less NPC shopkeep who has a wide stock of cursed items who shows up in all of my campaigns. He's a reoccuring cameo who occasionally shakes up the story by asking a big favor if the players buy enough from him. He's a little different each time but the idea is consistency so players know what to expect from him each time and will be rewarded for taking advantage of the mechanic.\n\nYou can always do a throwback character for your longertime players as a nod to previous campaigns, so long as you can explain it. (This is where I use multiverse theory. You may see the medieval character in the sci-fi setting, but that's because this is this world's version of the character.)",

Playing through different campaigns with the same character, is like a \"choose your own adventure\" book. You know, the kind where after a few pages, or a chapter, you're presented with two choices, and based on your choice, you're sent to a different part of the book to continue the story.

For example, if the starting level of the campaign is Level 3, your Level 3 character isn't a famous adventurer who's slain many notable monsters and villains, and that Level 3 adventurer hasn't killed or assassinated hundreds of people at this point of their adventuring career.\n\n* One situation I wouldn't allow a player to reuse a character of theirs is if I'm DMing two campaigns and the character in question is already being played in one of them.  I wouldn't allow the player to play the same character in two campaigns that are ongoing at the same time.  This is both for world building reasons, making it easier to manage the character sheets for each campaign (managing two different sheets of the exact same character could get very confusing), and not wanting every character a player plays to be a carbon copy of another one.\n\n* If your character dies in one of my campaigns and they don't end up being resurrected, you're not allowed to reuse that character in another one of my campaigns.  I understand that someone may really enjoy playing a particular character or character archetype, but usually I want character death to actually mean something in one of my games instead of character decisions that put a character in harm's way not mattering (such as if someone plays a reckless character).\n\n* I would generally discourage a player having a backup character who is a carbon copy of that player's current character.  I certainly don't mind if a player wants to play a character that may be similar, share the same base class as the previous one, or maybe have some relation to their first character (like being a friend or family member that would make sense to slot into the story).  But I do notice this a lot with people who play characters like Rogues, Warlocks, psionic characters, or witch/edgy type spellcasters in campaigns I've played in as a player.  Those players want to play a particular class or archetype and play it frequently.  And there's nothing necessarily wrong with that.

I'm a forever DM who's had a chance to play in a few one-shots & abandoned campaigns, so I have a few PCs that I want to play again and who have very little campaign history. \n\nAs a DM, I don't mind it, but for our group, it has to make sense for the same PC to be in both campaigns so it doesn't break immersion. We always check with the DM(s) of the original campaign(s) when PCs or NPCs cross-over. There have been no vetos yet. We've done some creative and fun world building to make it work.",
