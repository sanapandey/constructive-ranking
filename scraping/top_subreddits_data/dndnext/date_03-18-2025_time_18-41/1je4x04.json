    "selftext": "So I'm an okay lying experienced DM (I've DMd several one shots, a few medium sized campaigns, and 1 multi year long campaign), and have some new players who are interested in learning 5E, but I don't want to get them started on a full campaign or anything. I know I can't fully teach them DnD or anything with a one shot, but I would like to at least try. \n\nDoes anybody have any good recommendations for a one shot for 5E for introducing new players to DnD?

In my case, I had the added limitation of also having to fit the session within a 2 hour timeframe (but the players already some familiarity with D&D and provided their own character sheets).\n\nOf those, I think any world work, but I think **A Most Potent Brew** stands head and shoulders above the others, as I think it does a better job of highlighting the variety of aspects within D&D.",
