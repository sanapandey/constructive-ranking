Technical reason and speculation to follow...\n\nFirst off, this is likely covered under the \"Diagnostics & Usage Data\" people blindly hit \"I agree\" to all the time. Should it ever be discovered, that's going to be their defense. Second, they are most definitely not sending in a continuous stream; if they are sending voice data, it is likely curated to remove periods of silence or too much noise to only send usable data and is packaged up as part of the diagnostics & usage data I mentioned at some interval. But that's where it gets dicey...\n\nIn order to inspect what is being sent, you'd have to first need to break SSL to do a man-in-the-middle attack. Doable. However, if the Echo can't verify SSL authenticity, it is highly unlikely they are going to send anything but the most innocuous of data (i.e.. leaving the audio out) if they even send any data at all. Let's say, though, that you could get a full payload with the potentially incriminating data inside. There is nothing to say that it wouldn't *also* be encrypted meaning now the only path towards even sort of getting at the data is through inference... which is going to be a weak argument in court.\n\nYou could establish an experiment where you try to artificially influence the bandwidth utilization of the device by feeding it generated/recorded audio data throughout the day. This might prove difficult as it would all originate from a single point in space and their directional microphone system would clue them in on this and likely see it and at very minimum be notated that the sounds were not coming from a human moving throughout the environment. You would then probably need to create a scenario where you create believable sound - likely humans speaking in the room, repeating various phrases or keywords - across multiple Echo's across multiple accounts to see if the volume of vocalization or the types of words used affects any transmissions by the Echo itself. This is also not foolproof as they could do something like say \"hey we upload 5mb of data every day, regardless\" in which they send the most useful 5mb of data or simply empty data to take up the same amount of bandwidth irrespective of any audio observed.\n\nI highly suspect that, if this is being done, they have people thinking about all of these vectors of reverse engineering and have covered their bases considering the nature of this revelation, to your point, would have catastrophic legal and cultural consequences. If they haven't covered their bases, however: Amazon, give me a job.",

In the Amazon app you can view a history of your commands that have been sent. \n\nSo the way it works for most of these types of devices is they have minimal processing built into the smart speaker to reduce costs. There's enough though that they are constantly listening to the audio for certain keywords that it can recognize, like \"Alexa.\" So if you're talking with your friend in a room with an Echo it's always catching the audio and if it doesn't recognize one of those activation keywords it drops the data. If it does hear it, it compresses and sends the speech after it to their servers to decode and act on. \n\nWhat you can do, and many people have done, is route the traffic from the echo through a device on your network that can monitor the traffic for analysis to see when and how much internet traffic the device is generating. If it's uploading everything it hears, they should be able to detect that. As far as I know nobody has been able to find any evidence that it does send everything to the cloud. You can find several studies and lots of articles from hacker and network analyst types that have been looking for evidence that these devices are always spying on us.",

It depends on what your router is capable of and how much detail you're looking for. Since you don't know what your options are I'd suggest googling your router model and network monitor. Check out r/HomeNetworking and search there for things like network monitor and monitor traffic and start reading. There are a huge variety of free software solutions but what will work effectively depends as I said on if your router can provide you the data or not.\n\nIf your router can't, then you'll want to either buy a more manageable router or do [a setup like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE90T4WMF9k)\n\nAlso be aware if you do start to monitor that it's normal for devices to have a lot of traffic for their normal non-nefarious operation and can be overwhelming to look at so you'll want to take the time to learn what it all means before you start blocking stuff. It does make for a fun project and a great learning experience though to have a better understanding of what all your stuff is actually doing and how it all works.",

Echo devices are equipped with a microphone off button. When the button is pressed, the power to the microphones is disconnected and a dedicated red light is illuminated. When the microphones are turned off, your device cannot record and stream audio to the cloud, even when you say your chosen wake word.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GVP69FUJ48X9DK8V",

They do not send anything up to the cloud until they hear this word (or until you press a button in some cases).\n2. Most older Alexa devices have to send the audio recording captured after the wake word up to the cloud for NLP (Natural Language Processing). Let's call this \"remote NLP\". NLP takes an audio file and turns it into text, like \"Alexa, start a new timer for 10 minutes\". It's like OCR but for audio data. That text is processed within Amazon's cloud services.\n3. Some newer Alexa devices have powerful enough CPUs to do NLP locally. Let's call this \"local NLP\". You can currently opt in to say you want all NLP to be local NLP and never send audio recordings up to the cloud. This still sends the text of the request up to the cloud to be processed by Amazon's cloud services.\n4. The appearance of a new LLM-based Alexa feature called Alexa+ coincides with Amazon disabling local NLP. The reason for this is not entirely clear, although the functionality of Alexa+ appears to involve analyzing users' audio and video images as context for answering questions (\"Alexa, do I look happy?\")\n\nTl;dr: Amazon is not going to start recording everyone's Alexa devices 24x7.",

            "body": "Thanks for sharing our piece. Here's a snippet for more context: \n\nSince Amazon announced plans for a generative AI version of Alexa, we were concerned about user privacy. With Alexa+ rolling out to Amazon Echo devices in the coming weeks, we\u2019re getting a clearer view of the privacy concessions people will have to make to maximize usage of the AI voice assistant and avoid bricking functionality of already-purchased devices.\n\nIn an email sent to customers today, Amazon said that Echo users will no longer be able to set their devices to process Alexa requests locally and, therefore, avoid sending voice recordings to Amazon\u2019s cloud. Amazon apparently sent the email to users with \u201cDo Not Send Voice Recordings\u201d enabled on their Echo. Starting on March 28, recordings of every command spoken to the Alexa living in Echo speakers and smart displays will automatically be sent to Amazon and processed in the cloud.\n\nAttempting to rationalize the change, Amazon\u2019s email said: \u201cAs we continue to expand Alexa\u2019s capabilities with generative AI features that rely on the processing power of Amazon\u2019s secure cloud, we have decided to no longer support this feature.\u201d\n\nHowever, there are plenty of reasons people wouldn't want Amazon to receive recordings of what they say to their personal device. For one, the idea of a conglomerate being able to listen to personal requests made in your home is, simply, unnerving.\n\nFurther, Amazon has previously mismanaged Alexa voice recordings. In 2023, Amazon agreed to pay $25 million in civil penalties over the revelation that it stored recordings of children\u2019s interactions with Alexa forever. Adults also didn\u2019t feel properly informed of Amazon\u2019s inclination to keep Alexa recordings unless prompted not to until 2019\u2014five years after the first Echo came out.\n\nRead the full story:\u00a0[https://www.wired.com/story/everything-you-say-to-your-echo-will-be-sent-to-amazon-starting-march-28/](https://www.wired.com/story/everything-you-say-to-your-echo-will-be-sent-to-amazon-starting-march-28/)",
