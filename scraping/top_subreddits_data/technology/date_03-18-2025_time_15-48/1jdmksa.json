When you signed a PDF using this system it locked the PDF so it couldn't be edited using encryption. If someone tampered with the PDF in any way, the signature was broken. It was pretty high end encryption so not easily broken. It met the standards set by the US Government for such things at the time and the company eventually got a major contract with the US Navy - then got sold to IBM. \nHere is an (old) manual I found online:https://novascotia.ca/sns/pdf/PEViewer_UserGuide_62.pdf\n\nIt was a great piece of software. It was officially announced in a ceremony where the US president signed the first official document signed using a Digital Signature if I recall correctly. Canadian product by the way :)",

The only things I signed in paper in the last five years that are still consequential are as follows: doctor\u2019s offices, car loan, roof and ceiling repairs, local tax till last year, and marriage license. All others were electronic in one form or another. My student refinance/consolidation loan, homeowner\u2019s insurance, car insurance after being a dummy and forgetting to pay one month required a signature, internet, cellular provider, trash hauler, taxes, two credit cards, electricity\u2026\n\nOne area of government inefficiency commonly attacked by the public is the use of hard copy paper documents. The basis of this is CROMERR compliance in which legal documents cannot be digitally signed unless you have a sufficient authentication system to back it up. \n\nThe idea is that a defense could be used which says, \"I didn't digitally sign that document, my secretary did.\" In theory this could result in an effective defense, but in practice I don't believe it ever has. At the same time it is fairly common for a secretary or device to sign documents on behalf of high level employees (such as a CEO) anyways, so who cares if it was the digital or not? \n\nIf your local government requires that you submit something in hardcopy there is a fairly decent chance it is because CROMERR compliance and the local municipality hasn't dumped $250k into setting up a system to be able to receive digital signatures.\n\nAs silly as this attack on Biden seems, this is an area in which government is currently having a very public debate.",

The average person doesn\u2019t need to worry about their electronic signatures being invalidated by some court case Trump brings. That case would focus on a very narrow issue of whether presidential pardons (or all proclamations) must be \u201cwet-ink\u201d signed. It would take some broad act of Congress to invalidate the use of electronic signatures, and that won\u2019t happen because it would blow up the entire business world.",

The President physically had to put, by his hand, a symbol of his authority on the bill.\n\nThink of what that would have meant in the Founding Fathers' time: in those days, documents were signed by multiple ways. They could be stamped with a wax seal, signed by a pen, stamped with a wooden imprint, or even scratched into clay or metal. All of these things would constitute \"the President's signature\" in originalist interpretations.\n\nHowever, if George Washington had his aide sign the pardons of the Whiskey Rebellion using his signature, it would be void because the President did not sign it. If George Washington stamped his name on it- assuming he did the stamping -it would be valid if there were witnesses.\n\nMy point is that having a machine autonomously sign for the President is the same as Trump delegating another human being to put his signature on the paper. Neither the machine nor the aide is the President.\n\nThe same goes for pardons, even if pardons are not bills going through Congress. If the President is incapacitated, he cannot sign. The reason the Twenty-Fifth Amendment exists, besides securing Presidential succession, is to prevent the fiasco that happened when the devil got impatient and wanted Woodrow Wilson to come home faster, causing him to be a vegetable for the end of his last term. Unfortunately, history repeated itself perfectly with Biden's incapacitation, as his administration was too cowardly to pull the trigger and declare him incapable.",

If he did each pardon by hand, that's over 9000 seconds, which is 150 minutes, or two-and-a-half hours of continuous signing. If his administration claims he pardoned them all in the first hour, that means one of the following happened: \n\n1. He's sloppier when he knows his signature won't be seen, cutting his time down to 2 seconds per signature. \n\n2. They used an autopen or some other artificial signature method (a stamp or a copied digital signature).\n\n3. They had him sign pardons before he was inaugurated, which means any that occurred before the literal first hour of his administration would be illegitimate. \n\nThe answer is 1 or 2, probably 2.",

Congress surrendered its non-budgetary power to the administrative state a hundred years ago. Now, Trump is trying to scourge that very abomination.\n\nThe professionalization of the civil service created a parasitic, entrenched special interest group with a nearly monolithic hive mind of identical political and state interests. Every member of the federal government's civilian civil service is either a misanthrope, works for one, or enables misanthropy. Hatred of the American people is their glue.\n\nThe transformation of the civil service from instruments of the President's will to a permanent career path almost completely eliminated the ability of the President to govern and enact any facet of his agenda within the confines of the weakest head of government's office in the New World.\n\nBy eliminating the Spoils System, the President (and not just Trump, ALL PRESIDENTS) were enjoined from firing employees that impede their mandate and undermine the entire point of an unitary executive branch that is wholly separate from the legislature.\n\nANY President should be able to fire ANY employee of the federal government, at any time, and for any reason. There are noe exceptions, no party exemptions, and no limits on the ability of any President to fire any person in the executive branch.\n\nAny limit on it is both immoral and unconstitutional. Yes, a hypothetical President Harris should be able to fire a Department of Energy Employee for wearing a MAGA hat or picking his nose.",

One set of rules for Trump, another set for everyone else.\n\nNote, for example, that most people misunderstand or mischaracterize the Supreme Court's immunity ruling. They did NOT rule that Presidents have blanket immunity from the law. They ruled that they get to decide, on a case by case, instance by instance, basis which of a President's actions can be prosecuted and which can't.\n\nSimilar to how Loper Bright didn't actually say the courts are supposed to automatically deny deference to experts but rather they can decide on their own, in each individual case, when they will and won't allow deference to the experts. \n\nThe two of them are a masterful work of power grabbing and an assertion of the SCOTUS as the true rulers of America with the President subject to their will, assuming they can enforce their rulings. I'm betting Trump will ignore if they rule against him too much.",

It was already broadly assumed to be the case already. Prior relevant cases include:\n\n- Nixon v. Fitzgerald (1982) \u2013 The Supreme Court ruled that presidents have **absolute immunity from civil lawsuits** for actions taken within their official duties.\n\n- Clinton v. Jones (1997) \u2013 The Court ruled that this immunity **does not apply to unofficial acts**, meaning presidents could be sued for private conduct (like Clinton\u2019s actions before taking office).\n\nThe Trump ruling specifically addressed criminal prosecution for official acts, and did not specify it was absolute. Key points:\n\n- Presidents have **absolute immunity for \u201ccore\u201d official acts** \u2013 If an action is part of the president\u2019s constitutional duties (like signing laws, granting pardons, or commanding the military), they cannot be prosecuted for it \u2014 ever.\n\n- Presidents **do NOT have immunity for private acts**. Consistent with the Clinton decision. \n\n- Some acts fall in a \u201cgray area\u201d \u2013 The Court suggested that for actions that are arguably both official and unofficial, lower courts must analyze them carefully and decide.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

If that means that they selectively enforce it or have SCOTUS take it back, doesn\u2019t matter.

The \"investigation\" of its use seems to have gotten the signature images from the federal register website which typically has the autopen image on digital documents regardless of how the documents were actually signed so as far as I can tell there's no evidence that it was used for these particular pardons or any other pardons and even if it was used for these particular pardons the argument that Biden was unaware of them or didn't approve them doesn't pass muster since he publicly spoke about them shortly before or after they were signed.",

The actual use of the autopen isn't under question, it's whether or not a staffer was signing without the president's knowledge or understanding. That would effectively be a forgery case. \n\nMike Johnson made similar claims in the past regarding a Biden executive order for LNG exports. Not that that gives any credence to the claims, just that they're not especially novel right now.\n\nIt's going to be a weird case because I don't think there's precedent for burden of proof. Does the former Biden admin need to prove he was aware at the time of signing or does the Trump admin need to prove he wasn't? I would normally expect a judge to throw it out and say the burden is on the Trump admin. That being said, the court is pretty packed with conservatives so Trump probably has a shot.",

He was not investigating Hunter's business deals when he was removed.\u00a0\n\n\n\n>His son a felon with a gun charge and questionable child porn getting a full pardon\u00a0Pardoning judges who bank millions off locking children up in private prisions\u00a0\n\n\nYou can certainly disagree with a pardon. I've disagreed with many from multiple presidents. They're still explicitly included in the constitution, so hardly count as a constitutional crisis.\u00a0\n\n\n>Oh his keeping classified materials in his unlocked garage in Delaware\u00a0\n\n\nDidn't a conservative judge decide this was fine?\n\n\n>that later the investigation claimed he was mentally unfit to answer the questions or remember The 28th amendment that he tried to enforce that isn\u2019t real\u00a0\n\n\nA conservative investigator found that there wasn't enough evidence to move the case forward. This is stated numerous times in the report.\u00a0\n\n\n>The total amount from China, specifically with CEFC and their related entities, to the Biden family and their associates is over $8 million.\n\n\nMore of a conspiracy theory than anything else.\u00a0\n\n\n\n>Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris claimed the migrants were being whipped by horse-mounted US Border Patrol agents.[1][2]In July 2022, the US Customs and Border Protection concluded after an investigation that no migrants in fact had been whipped.\n\n\nI'm not familiar with this, but a president lying about something isn't a constitutional crisis.\u00a0\n\n\n>The list goes on and on but you\u2019ll find every single reason why he is a god amongst men and he is perfect infallible a beacon of hope\n\n\nI'm not asking for reasons you dislike Biden. I'm asking for an example of a constitutional crisis under his administration.\n\n\nI haven't even said anything positive about Biden, so I'm not sure why you think I believe he's a god or somehow perfect.\u00a0",

The only thing in the Constitution that says specifically \"signed\" is laws in Article I, Section 7.\n\n> before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated\n\nSo it'll be up to Trump to define what \"grant\" means and then indicate that whatever that meaning is, isn't discretionary.  Because if Trump can make the argument that he thinks something is declassified, it becomes declassified.  Then Biden can say that \"grant\" means to him that him thinking someone is pardon is pardoned.\n\nAdditionally, Trump keeps trying to say Biden knew nothing about the pardons except for the fact that he gave several interviews about the pardons and talked about them at length.\n\nSo I'm game for this, let's see how they twist this to only apply to Biden.",

Can a president authorize someone else to use the autopen in his absence? Courts have not ruled on this issue, however Obama ran into some controversy over his authorizing its use over the phone. The constitutionality of that has never been tested, but in that case, it was a bill, and even if the signature was found to be invalid, an unsigned and unvetoed bill becomes law anyway.

He, for instance, refused to turn over the Branch tapes to the National Archives, claiming that he, as the President, had the right to dispense of confidential and classified information as he so saw fit. In the case of those tapes, he kept them in his sock drawer as momentoes.\n\nThe courts sided with Clinton against Judicial Watch, ruling that the President was within his rights to take official records home, regardless of what he chose to do with them. The tapes, since they remained in the possession of the President who created them, constituted \"personal records\" instead of \"official presidential records.\" In other words, if the President takes home a document that he created while he was President, it is his property for life.\n\nThis case is just one of many examples of the impunity of the President to dispense with executive records as he sees fit.\n\nBill Clinton's decision to take home those tapes and classified material was completely legal, ethical, and acceptable, and he literally did nothing wrong.\n\nNeither did Trump.",

Bush actually asked for a legal review on the legality of the use of the autopen and received a favorable finding from the DOJ that authorized use to represent the President's signature is as valid as an original signature itself.

Adding that they did this as part of Campaign effors and used fraud to hide the reason for the reimbursement elevates it to a felony. Again, as found by an actual judge and jury not by random people on the internet.\n\n2. >The President has the unlimited, unquestioned, and absolute right, at any time, to dispense of classified material in any way he sees fit.\n\nWrong. There are 2 classification systems, one by the executive and one by the law. Nuclear secrets for example are classified by law not by the presidents authority. Those cannot be unilaterally declassified by the President, like other documents can.\n\nSecond declassification must follow a process to be legal. You can't just think or say \"declassified\". Documents must be properly marked. The president could have declassified the documents but if they are not properly marked they must be treated as classified until properly marked. If you don't believe me, believe Trumps lawyers who litterally argued this after he tweeted out he \"declassified\" certain things and then people asked for them under FOIA requests and they went to court on his behalf to argue that \"just tweeting doesn't count he needs to follow proper process for it to count.\"\n\nIf he was still in office doing this, here is no crime. But as soon as he stopped being president and brought them home anway any powers he had no longer apply.\n\nYou are also ignoring that the FBI requested the documents back, and a judge ordered trump to return them, making the classification issue moot. There was a court order to return them. Trump LIED to the FBI and judge in a sworn statement signed by his lawyer that the documents were returned when he knew they were not. This in and of itself is unquestionably a crime. If he had in good faith returned all the documents when asked then I would disgaree with them charging him, but he didn't and instead lied about top secret documents he was keeping.",

A \u201cwet signature\u201d can be very important for some  legal contracts. I worked on The Hill in the 90\u2019s and frequently used an autopen to sign letters and documents for a US Senator. This was extremely common. At the time the autopen was in the basement and you brought metal plates to the machine that we put into the machine so the pen knew how to write the signature. These plates were grooved and led a metal arm through the motions to sign the document. My senator had two plates. One that informally signed his first name and one that was a formal official signature. I signed thousands of letters for the Senator, and this was common across all of congress. I spent hours - if not days - in that basement room placing a paper in the desk in a slot and pushing the pedal under the desk.  I honestly am stunned these are still used, but I can see how a photoshop or a printer would be challenged to replace this, especially since with an autopen you can see the indentations in the paper showing it was actually signed. \n\nWhile I do not doubt Biden may have used an autopen (as people get older arthritis frequently restricts how much someone can write), it is the intent of the signature making the item a valid document of communication. So unless Mr. Trump can prove that Biden did not review and approve the pardons being signed, these documents should not be invalidated. There are decades upon decades of precedent allowing autopen signatures to be legal. Obviously, fraud could happen here, but for me, in my era, those plates were in a locked safe and were guarded like they were the Crown Jewels. I can not even imagine the security around the autopen of POTUS. \n\nOne of the things I personally find odd is how often Mr. Trump\u2019s signature looks as if it was signed with a sharpie. I guess this is only tangentially related, but it is very different than most other presidential signatures. I wonder if in his age if his struggles with arthritis and holding a smaller pen barrel or if this is just stylistic.",

The topic is more interesting than is given merit here. \n\nAn autopen is technological device that physically produces a wet signature that is a replica of the signatory. It is intended to be used only with consent of the signatory. But as you can imagine, like most technologies it has a security vulnerability - it can be hacked and used surreptitiously by someone without the signatories knowledge or consent. All signatures can technically be \u2018hacked\u2019 via replication, but the existence of an autopen makes fraud that much easier to conduct. \n\nFor any document signed via autopen, the risk of potential fraud opens up any such document to legal inquiry as to whether or not there was consent by the signatory to use the autopen on their behalf. Circumstantial evidence surrounding its use may be used to bring about an inquiry. This inquiry can be satisfied by affirmation of the signatory after the fact, or, in absence of that, presumably by contemporaneous witnesses to consent being given and potentially others who witnessed the signatory discussing their consent after the fact. \n\nAs others have mentioned, the constitution doesn\u2019t require the President sign a pardon. But the President must *make* the pardon, either verbally or via signature. Since Biden did not make a physical formal address to the public or press regarding the pardons that happened his last day as President, the issue again becomes one of confirmation via his own testimony or that of witnesses.",

This explains why you think everyone is upset the entire time they're engaging with you. \n\n1. Start rambling about CNN, no matter the topic or what is said about it. You double down if someone tells you they don't watch CNN. \"Denying you watch CNN means you definitely watch it\" and other closely related nonsense. You do this because you think you \"win\" if you frustrate someone, and because it's easier to dismiss people as using \"CNN talking points\" instead of admitting you're misinformed or providing actual proof of your claims. \n\n\n2. Start saying that anyone who disagrees with you is belittling you or invalidating your feelings. The reality is that your feelings are not relevant to most conversations. Having feelings about it does not magically make you able to diagnose any neurological diseases at all. Telling you that what you typed does not make sense is not belittling you. Not every interaction results in you being a victim. \n\nYou abandon the core conversation really quickly.
