Further destroying Comcast, charter, and the other servants of the cable devils. THE BEST PART! They're not a publically traded company, they're a \"co-op\". Their end goal isn't just profit for the consumers and the consumers have a vote in how things are run!

I mean these new guys are literally pushing a mile to get 3-4 clients. Odds are good that most of their route is just branching off of a master plan to join smaller towns together but it's still kind of crazy.\n\nStill miss the old wireless guys though.

They do the dumbest tunnel to get IP's and I've found it impossible to do any sort of VPN through it making it half way useless to most business I've dealt with.",

I'd go fiber in a heartbeat if I could, but even if they laid cable on my county road, they likely won't bring it to me as the house is a 1/4 mile down my driveway from the county road. It's certainly my choice as to where I live, so I'm not complaining, but that's the rural landscape, and I don't see the fiber companies running long cable lengths like that all over rural America for single homes. Certainly they will for small towns or where there are clusters of homes, but for many of us, some type of wireless is our only option for the foreseeable future.",

The Starlinks actually work great as well but more latency along with odd routing/hardware etc. \n\nThe key word is you need to be with a good company and you need to be in their coverage area.

Evan Feinman, who directed the program for the last three years, wrote in a departing email to staff that Starlink\u2019s satellite internet is \u201cinferior\u201d to alternatives, \u201cdelivering slower speeds at higher costs to the household paying the bill.\u201d\n>\n>...\n>\n>Howard Lutnick, the new Commerce Secretary, has said the agency would review BEAD and remove burdensome requirements that have slowed down deployment as well as, crucially, eliminate any preference for fiber.\n>\n>\u201cShovels could already be in the ground in three states, and they could be in the ground in half the country by the summer without the proposed changes to project selection,\u201d Feinman wrote in his email, adding these states should be allowed to move forward with their plans while program changes remain in flux. Internet access, being just about as important as other basic necessities, is considered by many a utility today, but internet providers have not had much incentive to expand into rural areas that would be less profitable. BEAD was meant to address this with subsidies and incentives.\n>\n>...\n>\n>Starlink is generally more expensive than broadband fiber. The satellite dish itself costs $349 (sans promotions), with service typically going for $120 per month. Feinman argues that while fiber might be more expensive to deploy upfront, households will be left with faster and more affordable internet service for years to come.\n>\n>Elon Musk himself said from the early days that Starlink would never replace fiber broadband for those who already have it, as the service inherently has limitations that ground-based infrastructure does not. The service is a good option for remote areas without access to fiber, and SpaceX has partnered with cruise and airline operators to offer internet in moving vehicles. Starlink is good if it is the only option. If the government supports the development of broadband in rural areas, however, it would make Starlink a harder sell. By potentially eliminating the program\u2019s preference for fiber, states might be pushed to adopt Starlink for its lower roll-out cost.\n\nThis all comes down to will rather than ability. If companies could connect almost every home in the nation by telephone in the middle of the last century, then companies can provide almost every home in the nation with wired internet access in this century. Better yet, corporate lobbying aside, local governments should be encouraged to build out this critical infrastructure for their residents, rather than rely on the whims of private companies to build it instead.",

They had the city at 100% fiber, but couldn't go beyond city limits due to being tied up in court. Eventually the city won, and a year or so later Comcast and AT&T offered slower fiber at a higher monthly fee  Comcast and AT&T didn't have a joint monopoly of the area, and if it were not for the city fiber service they would still be using copper and existing DSL connections.\n\nThe benefits of having city services on fiber alone justified the upfront costs, and there's more than enough bandwidth for business and consumers to ride it. Fiber is the best publically available data transfer medium, and once again this administration wants to reverse universally beneficial progress because they stand to personally profit from doing so.\n\nEdit: stupid typos.",

And it does nothing. You could do that 100 times and not one subscriber would notice because the whole system is dynamically redundant. It remaps all the traffic continuously because each satellite is overhead for just a few minutes at any given spot, there's at least 7 visible to the dish at a time. Obviously shooting them would be inordinately expensive and conspicuous. Every other country in the world is going to be giving you a stern talking to after the first one.",

This funding is funneled through the states and requires them to follow specific processes but they can to an extent, administer those requirements how they see fit. \n\nThe government started by identifying where service is needed based on the speeds they set as a threshold. From there, they allowed companies and communities to review these maps and protest any inaccuracies. Now they would move on to the contractor selection phase. From there the intent is to pick contractors to provide durable and easy to maintain infrastructure to communities that need it while stimulating the economy via the buy America requirement and added jobs needed to build and then maintain the infrastructure and the added customers. There also is a requirement for offering an affordable plan for low income folks.  Preference given to open networks. \n\nHaving *stable* high speed access allows members of rural or underserved communities to attend classes, work remotely, and many other things that are now major parts of our economy and everyday lives. The program was intended to make investing in rural communities attractive to businesses from an initial capital expense perspective and to connect the US with what is considered a necessary utility these days. It is an enormous undertaking but seemed to be going ok. I live in an area where some communities qualified for the program. It was causing quite the stir w current service providers who haven\u2019t updated their service in years because they have had no reason to. They were/are about to have competition. People generally seemed very excited to finally get reliable service.  Hopefully that still happens.",

Essentially you have two options. You have other satellite providers who will give you like 3-10MB download speeds with 0.5MB upload speeds. The other option is line of site. Which essentially you put a receiver on the highest point on your property where you, which is usually your old TV antenna, and it gets pointed at another one and that one goes to another one and so on until it's connected to the main source. Speeds for that is about 10MB down and 3MB up. Obviously dial up is still an option, but even with that you're looking at like 48kb a second and it's almost totally useless at this point, however I do know of some farmers who still have it. \n\nThe best option being line of site, can fail, and sometimes for extended periods of time if any of those links through the network fails. So if one falls off, or gets obstructed by a tree, or a bird's next or something like that it can cut off your internet totally or compromise the speed. \n\nAll the things I have listed are from first hand experience. Currently we have line of site internet and it has gotten better over the years for sure, it is not as good as people who I know that have Starlink. Their connections are way more stable, the speeds are 10X faster and you can even play online games without connection issues. Imagine having to watch all your videos online at 240 or 480.

It might even allow them to gather troves of data on the elderly in rural Americans for nefarious purposes without a warrant, and without challenge.  Maybe even use it to strengthen bullshit claims of SSA fraud? Nah, surely such covert corruption would be unheard of.

Valley Electric Association Inc. is receiving a $542,281 Cooperative Agreement to promote the deployment of high-speed fiber networks to the rural areas of Clark, Esmerelda, Lyon, Mineral and Nye counties\n\nhttps://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2024/12/18/biden-harris-administration-connects-people-and-businesses-rural-areas-reliable-high-speed-internet#:~:text=Press%20Release-,Biden%2DHarris%20Administration%20Connects%20People%20and%20Businesses%20in%20Rural%20Areas,Speed%20Internet%20in%2018%20States&text=USDA%20Secretary%20Tom%20Vilsack%20today,to%20reliable%20high%2Dspeed%20internet.\n\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpolicy.org/publications/detail/the-42-billion-internet-program-that-has-connected-0-people\n\nI would agree that it has been a problem far before Biden and Trump though. Somehow the ISPs keep pocketing the money without actually doing the connections. https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6c5e97/eli5_how_were_isps_able_to_pocket_the_200_billion/",

And I rarely received the speeds they claimed. I'm not supporting Musk by any means, but I tried TMobile out here and they would throttle too, only to up the speeds when I called. No joke I tested this on multiple occasions as I WFH. Then you got the other satellites which, holy hell are insanely expensive and terrible.  I imagine though once those options are gone, Musk will do that exact thing and charge you for over 300 gigs of data, which I can use in a weekstime. I am hoping forsome true free market competition out here in the boonies, but with mountainous terrain I won't hold my breath.",

Fiber to **absolutely everyone** isn't the solution, because in a lot of cases it doesn't make fiscal sense.  You need a phased approached.  Fiber to every town no matter how small. And fiber to everyone within a specific distance of every town (2-3 miles out for small, further for larger, basically trying to cover 95% of the population density), and then fixed 5Ghz wireless from there to the far far edges.\n\nI used to live way way out in the middle of nowhere, and while sure, I would have loved fiber, it wouldn't have made sense for the tax payers to subsidize running fiber 8 miles down my dirt road to just service me and my one other close neighbor.  In my area, there were roughly 5 houses in a 5 mile radius, and none of them were clustered together.  Because of the way the roads ran, you would have to have run about 15 miles of fiber from one end to the other to connect just 5 houses.  2 of those houses were old farmers who really didn't care about internet (1 still had a flip phone and no computer).\n\nI used to pay $160/m for 3Mbps wireless internet that rarely gave me 1/2 of that when it worked at all.  After almost a decade of that, I took matters into my own hand.  I started my own small ISP and rented a tower in town next to the Telco and provided 100Mbps wireless to myself and a lot of people in my area.  The cost of providing fast low latency (1ms) wireless to an area covering 176 sq miles cost \\~$2000 worth of equipment on my side and a $40 CPE on the client side.  That makes way more sense than the millions of dollars it would have cost to provide fiber to those same people.  Most of my clients never spiked above 30 Mbps and most averaged less than 6 during the wakeful hours.  A semi-fast reliable connection is all they really wanted and required, not 1Gbps.  \n  \nI know every geographic region is different, so different solutions will be needed in different places (pine trees are a bitch for 5Ghz) but there is no reason we shouldn't be looking at what is best for the people **and** what is best for the taxpayer (thank you John Nash Jr).  Oh, and Starlink is not the answer.  While it may be a life saver for now for some people, it should eventually be phased out with more local solutions (fiber/wireless) and definitely should not be subsidized.",
