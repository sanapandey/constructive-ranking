Idt insurance companies have any reason to offer it. If you insure with them great, if you don't and your vehicle gets stolen you're out 80-100k. It sucks bcuz we were interested in an EV but there's no way unless we somehow have it listed in another city. Better off buying a work truck for 10k.",

Of those 63, only [13 of them are Teslas](https://imgur.com/a/QAsdO4D). So that's 50 different options that you can peruse through. Other sites I'm sure will have more options.",

Making replacement parts isn't sexy, but auto manufacturers do it and it's just part of the business.

Ideally you'd have the option to do both depending on the situation but I can definitely see why companies would go for slower charging if that's not an option.\n\nThe really annoying part is that this \"upside\" to Tesla's in terms of charging network coverage is also one of the worst things about Tesla. They refuse to work with other companies toward creating a universal charging standard for EVs, meaning there's competing standards and we aren't making progress towards a system that benefits everyone. Tesla wants to drive other EVs out of business and be the only option, they don't actually give a fuck about what is good for consumers OR even what is good for the environment.\n\nHell Tesla batteries potentially wearing out faster due to their fast charging is probably an upside as far as Musk is concerned; it forces you to replace your car sooner!",

My car is just an older model before they came out with the new tech to allow for faster charging. \n\nAnd for those of us that do 95% of our charging on a home charger, I'm not too concerned with battery degradation from the rare times when I'm on the road and need to charge.  \n\nAnd FYI, the US market is slowly moving towards Tesla's charger (NACS) being the standard. I think 2025 Ford models might already have a NACS port, and I know Hyundai/Kia will within the next year or two. I think VW is also switching over. Ultimately it's mostly about Tesla caring and other manufacturers not caring enough to fight. If Tesla allows Ford to use their chargers then Ford will happily use Tesla's charge port.",

FSD is available on HW3-HW5, but HW3 gets a degraded version.\n\nAnd again, even if ol' Melon Husk got up on stage and said FSD doesn't exist, it wouldn't change the fact that my car, today, drives me to work and back autonomously, and so do millions of others'.

Over reliance on the self driving/safety features, plus the increased acceleration. People who drive Teslas tend to have worse driving records which make them riskier, I don't know if that is related to the type of people who buy the car (like RAM drivers) or just the car itself being difficult for already average drivers. \n\nI'm not an actuary, I just see the notes when they come through to be popped into production and so I get nosy and ask. It is pretty rare for us to completely pull coverage, especially on an entire brand. I don't know that we did it with Kia or Hyundai or not during that whole debacle, I'd have to go back and look.",

It DOES make sense to me that a car that is entirely electronic is less forgiving of repairs. It's typical to use every piece of available space when designing electronics and imagine if your cell phone had a crumple zone when you dropped it.\n\nI think as the market for EVs grow, there will be a growing market for \"dumber\" EVs. Instead of adding a billion cameras, the ability to drive automatically, a fucking computer, and just every piece of tech gadget you can think of, I think some manufacturers will have analog dials, simple interior, and the only thing fancy and tech heavy will be the actual drive train and battery pack. That in itself would make a simple front end collision a lot less of a headache.",

A **6 year** car loan for a new vehicle which starts at \\~$21K? \n\nThat monthly payment is only achievable if one takes the most expensive trim, offers no trade in, no downpayment, and middling to bad credit. The site basically cherrypicked the worst case scenario to make a bad situation seem even worse in comparison which just undermines the point they are trying to convey.\n\n  \nAlso, avoid 6 year auto loans like the plague. And if you must take them, **buy gap insurance for the love of God.** You absolutely **must** get gap coverage with those long term loans or you **will** be holding that loan to term even if someone totals your car a day after driving it off the lot.\n\n  \nSo many people don't have gap coverage, and they get screwed over big time when this happens with these long loan terms. Especially considering the car is worth basically half its value shortly after buying it more or less. And you're at the whim of every idiot on the road.\n\n  \nTl;dr: **buy gap insurance if you have an auto loan.** Unless you like the idea of finding a loan issuer which will let you roll over you old loan into a new loan for an even bigger debt trap essentially paying two auto loans for a single vehicle. This is how people get stuck in that 10 year auto loan cycle.",

When I look at my policy documents it isn't much more expensive than my Toyota Corolla, despite being 10 years newer.  \n\nThis happens all of the time with EVs, most people only know Tesla so they think Tesla issues are EV issues.\n\nFor example, when I got my EV in 2020 everyone said that EVs suffered from a lot of road noise. The theory was that, without the engine making so much noise, you heard a lot more road noise. I test drove my Kia and the thing was quiet, far quieter than any car I had ever driven. It turns out that Teslas just had really shitty soundproofing back then, and didn't soundproof their windows at all. But people didn't distinguish and just said that EVs had bad road noise when it was actually a Tesla problem.\n\n-edit- so it appears that /u/NYG_Longhorn replied to me (it's in my inbox) and then immediately blocked me so that I couldn't argue against his dumb post below, so I guess I'll do it here:\n\nMy entire point is that as the dominant US EV Tesla skews the numbers to make a Tesla problem appear to be an EV problem, and you come back to me with stats that include Tesla? OF COURSE EVs are more expensive to insure in the US - Tesla dominates the US EV market and Teslas are expensive to insure.\n\nWhy don't we try comparing a Chevy Bolt to a similar non-EV Chevy, or a Hyundai Kona EV to a regular Hyundai Kona. You wouldn't want to do that, though, because it would prove you wrong.",

Insurance rates are far less brand specific than people imagine. 99% of insurance is your driving record and relationship with the company the rest of it is distributing costs amongst all policy holders to normalize insurance costs for the company. When Kia\u2019s were going bonkers a few years ago during the Kia boys timeline we all saw insurance rise. Criminal actions targeting a brand don\u2019t mean that that particular brand or model is the problem to insurers instead they view all policies as a liability because of the economic interpretation of the human element and increase prices for everyone. Most likely scenario here is going to be a rise in insurance for anyone near a hot bed of anti Tesla activity, ie major cities. There is also this assumption commercial insurance is somehow different than consumer insurance but just know Tesla uses commercial contracts with the commercial side of a consumer insurance company. Any and all claims they make on that side get normalized across both for the sake of the company. Commercial.geico.com vs geico.com for instance are the same products to geico.",

If you look at track tests, despite the car's ridiculous straight-line speed, it tends to put up pretty lackluster track times. (And it leaves drivers shaken up and terrified.) Especially the braking is fucking criminal on that thing -- it's got basically the stock Model S brakes and those are already barely adequate for how fast and heavy a base Model S is. For the even faster and heavier Plaid...\n\nWell, let's just say if you actually want to push one of those things to its limits, you'd better be a *very* expert driver, and you'd better hit the brakes *way* earlier than you would on any other performance car.",

IIHS also does not measure fatality per miles driven but by number of registered years. If fatalities or number of registered years for a certain vehicle are not large enough to be statistically significant, they are not included.\n\nThe IIHS data is broken down by categories; in the only category where Teslas are represented (mid-sized luxury vehicles) they take the #2 and #6 spots, out of 9.\n\nModel 3 4WD has a 52 rate.\n\nModel 3 2WD has a 15 rate.\n\nAverage rate for all 2020 cars is 38.\n\nHigher/more powerful trim having a higher rate than average, while the lower trim of the same model having lower, could suggest that hotshot drivers are responsible for the excess deaths, or perhaps the presence of premium self-driving features. From a crash safety perspective, Teslas generally do well, so that is probably not a significant factor, though current crash safety tests don't have any particular focus on volatile batteries for EVs or some largely Tesla-specific design features like overcomplicated methods of emergency egress.",

I'd also like to point out, in the real world, accidents aren't always the fault of the person it happens to. Have a Tesla? Fine. You can be the safest driver in the world and it doesn't matter when some idiot with NJ plates just plows into you because they think they are more important than everyone else on the road. \n\n  \n**Even if you aren't at fault, your rates can and do rise.** They access and set overall rates based on risk, not blame (although blame is a multiplier; it means even not at fault owners still shoulder higher rates for morons hitting their vehicles *statistically).* And in the couple no fault states? Your rates will rise simply because you always claim against your own insurance even if someone hit you while you had the right of way or they operated illegally. Sure, insurance companies will still attempt to subrogate. But that's for them. Risk is based on occurrence, not moral determination.\n\n  \nIt's a meme about BMW drivers, just like it is a meme about Tesla drivers. Confirmation bias in action.\n\n  \nBut insurance companies know better because they use actuarial science and have to defend their rating decisions in each state and some districts. Here's an example of the normalized vehicles most likely to be involved in an at fault accident:\n\n[https://insurify.com/car-insurance/insights/car-models-with-the-most-accidents-2023/](https://insurify.com/car-insurance/insights/car-models-with-the-most-accidents-2023/)\n\n  \nLots of Subaru vehicles on there despite their reputation. And you'll note a total lack of BMW and Tesla vehicles.\n\n  \nThis isn't just because some of these cars are popular; it's a percentage within each cohort. You are significantly more likely to cause an at fault accident if you drive one of these 10 vehicles.\n\n  \nSubaru has the opposite reputation as BMW, being a brand which intentionally markets toward basically laid back hippy-ish lesbians (and I'm not making that up; it is an intentional image they crafted  for themselves and market to this day). But on the road? The absolute worst drivers overall. Aggressive, entitled, distracted, pick your poison. \n\n  \nNow that I point it out, maybe someone reading this will notice it the next time they drive. And it puts into perspective how memes influence our worldviews despite the data.",

But even I am seeing Teslas being driven around vandalized. \n\n  \nAnyone who excuse makes for it would absolutely lose their shit if it became politically excusable or rationalized for someone doing something to their property. Imagine, the next time one is out and about, people just slap you phone out of hands and stomp on it for pick-a-reason-from-the-bingo-card.

I honestly think they are still terrified of protests and riots which is why they are trying to shut down the protests and pretend to do things by the book. They don't have enough power to get away with it yet, they are biding their time until they know the people can't hold them accountable anymore. We still have a chance. Once they stop lying, we are fucked forever because they will know that no one can stop them.",

We're talking about cars being spray-painted, set on fire, having windows shattered and even being shot. And all of it is seemingly pointed back to Tesla's controversial CEO, Elon Musk.\n\nTesla vandalism isn't exactly a new phenomenon. It's a tale as old as Tesla and has been so prominent across the brand that it spawned popular YouTube channels like Wham Baam Teslacam which showcased folks keying the cars even before Elon Musk started down his political path.

Even if you have a lot of money, trading in cars every few years is a losing proposition every time.  You don't stay wealthy by making choices like that.  Especially with EVs which can last much, much longer than gas cars.\n\nAlso, just from a moral philosophy standpoint, your suggestion only works if there is someone else out there who is willing to buy the Tesla from the used car lot.  So...the number of net Tesla owners didn't change, and so your line \"you are still making a choice\" doesn't really work since the only way THIS person can make the choice you want them to make is if SOMEONE ELSE made the opposite choice.  If no one else was willing to buy them, car dealers wouldn't accept the trade in.",

If you bought a Tesla, that's partially on you EVEN THOUGH you're probably a progressive that is horrified by it.  That's why many people are choosing to buy stickers to make it clear to their friends and neighbors where they stand on the issue.  People are afraid, and seeing supportive messages on Teslas helps identify that their neighbors see how bad this is and they can be trusted.\n\nIf you don't want to make that stand, that's fine!

Also you saying \"You are only creating more division\" and then calling me a fool is beyond ironic, so good work there.  But since that's the tone you are taking, let me meet you where you are at.\n\nThe people doing the vandalize Teslas don't give a fuck about Tesla owners' struggle here because they see upper middle class people's struggle with property value as unimportant compared to the existential threat to democracy we are seeing.  If you are buying a tesla you can weather the storm and quite franklin, some paint on your car doesn't render it useless.\n\nAnd the point that you keep trying to argue which is verifiably wrong is that \"this crap\" doesn't help their effort.  It literally does, we can see the effects with our eyes.  I can read charts, I can read articles like the one we are literally commenting on *right now*.  It is working, unquestionably.\n\nIf you want to argue about the morality, go for it.  That's not an argument I was having.  But your inability to differentiate between \"I don't like this protest\" and \"This protest doesn't work\" is doing you no favors.  You are calling people \"fools\" in conversation because you are becoming emotional about destruction of property and missing the point here.\n\nTesla owners that are anti-trump are not going to become pro-trump because someone fucks with their car.  They might be pissed, it might really fucking ruin their year, but the fact of the matter is, the protesters see much more to gain from these types of protest than lose.  And the real world actual effects are apparent, even if they make you and tesla owners upset.",

Insurance rates skyrocketing, repair costs increasing, parts less easy to come by, the aftermarket demand crashing.

But it will catch up to you, and you will have to make a choice.\n\nSell or drop the Tesla off at a junkyard for all I care. Find a way. If you could afford a Tesla, you can afford a used junker until you get the opportunity to buy a different EV. There is public transportation as well. But is not our job to teach you or show you the way. \n\nBut if you feel any shame or anger about people calling you a Nazi for owning a Tesla\u2026 well maybe you should ponder why that is.",

None of the traditional car makers seem interested in really prioritizing EVs, and Tesla's charging network is still the only one widespread and reliable enough to make long distance trips easy to do.\n\nIt's been frustrating over the years to be a normal Tesla owner. There has always been a ton of negative press about Tesla even before it became common knowledge that Elon Musk was an evil idiot. My personal conspiracy theory is that oil companies and short sellers spent massive amounts of money trying to create a general negative opinion about the only successful electric car company in the US. These days it's hard to argue with people about it when the CEO is doing Nazi salutes on TV. It's still crazy to me that with climate change being arguably the most important issue of our time, somehow we got to the point where owning the most popular electric car is considered morally wrong.",

They are now trying to see whether they qualify for some kind of incentive option with Polestar but not sure how that will work with a lease.  \n\nI hate Elon and own a position in TSLZ (an inverse ETF).  I\u2019m actively cheering the fall of the stock but I also objectively think the company is screwed.  It\u2019s unfortunate because there is some good technology they\u2019ve created.  \n\nI also know some people who have gone to work at Tesla in finance roles.  They are good and hardworking people but these roles are usually enticing because they come with equity.  I can\u2019t imagine they aren\u2019t looking to sell and exit as soon as they can at this point.  \n\nAt the end of the day the car business is tough.  Margins are thin and you hear lots of stories of big car businesses struggling to make a profit despite having decent revenue and sales.  Elon FA and now he\u2019s FO.  It\u2019s likely why he is trying to get that pay package again right now- there is a good chance it won\u2019t have the cash in a year.

Consumers need to be informed, make informed purchases, AND consider their budgets when making said purchases. Tesla leadership has been dubious at best for nearly half a decade as have their goals, intentions and claims.\u00a0\n\n\nHow many times have they had to push dates back? Failure to meet deadlines is a very indicative health marker of how a company is doing.

Since things are going to shit, I don't know how long it will take to save that much.\n\nSo, all this said, fuck Musk and let all of his companies burn. He already took my money, don't let him take someone else's too.",

Am I that \"we\" and if so, who am I being sold to? The founders thought and fought for language which I now participate, so who is this \"we\"?\n\nLet me tell you something about this \"we, the people\" subscribed here in America. It is a newly-upgraded populace, now with global intelligence. Many feel AI is regional, with the old ideas about borders and protection. We all feel AI means Augmented Intelligence, and no one can restrict your intelligence.\n\nThere will always be a melting problem here in this pot. Do we have too much freedom? Part of that problem was that some people lived a different life, they simply decided how to live and that decision was different. How do I make them pay a little bit towards how I live and think?\n\nAugmented Intelligence helps here, you can ask it to replay your own life as someone else. Is Empathy a detriment or a virtue? Should humans born elsewhere have any rights at all? Empathy is knowing your part in history, and realizing you might be seen as a villain in the future. It takes a village to raise some adults.\n\nDivision makes us weak.\n\nThink about those you lost, and multiply their hopes and dreams. That is the promise of AI, augmenting our intelligence not by their slop but by their unique human contribution. We all add something.\n\nMy grandparents were raised divided and racist, because they were born white. Their perspective on the last world war, the American civil rights movement, the continuing immigration here due to our sand and current politics was slanted. Everyone crossing into democracy, through birth or border is new. How do we treat our new citizens?\n\nWho makes an American? If you have a child, who teaches them to be racist? Did you vote against the suffrage of women, should they be property? Do rich people deserve different, and more elevated rights than those struggling? We ask who we are.\n\nWe are we. Always have been, divided by special interests and their ambition, but rejoiced in the tiny gestures of unity. We never needed help dividing, but division creates an electorate.\n\nWe are the future, and the side-effects of that drug do not slow our progress. A king forcing cruelty does not make us strong. A king measures his foot, while stepping into his grave. We, as Americans, are people of strength. Eventually we will notice the weakness of division and rejoin the strength in unity.",
