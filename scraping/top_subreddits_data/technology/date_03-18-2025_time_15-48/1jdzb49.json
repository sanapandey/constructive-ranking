It's about a measurement of magnitude, it's not a characteristic. You can experience a certain amount of \"g\" through any sort of external force.\n\nYou claimed the don't experience any g forces, when in fact they do. They experience, as you said, 95% of the force as someone on the surface.\n\nThe reason it's called zero g is because they don't experience the reaction forces on their body (contact with the ground for example) or inside their body (spine/joint compression etc).\n\nThey are subject to the gravitational force fully, but don't experience any reaction forces - as a result are constantly accelerating and it's the direction of this acceleration that keeps them in orbit. The only reaction forces they feel are when they push off/touch the station or other objects, and even then they only feel the difference between them as both have a major component of unreacted gravitational force.\n\nThe free body diagram for the astronaut is *unbalanced*.\n\n\"g force\" is just a mass-specific force that uses standard gravity for scale. In orbit an astronaut is experiencing the exact same g force as anyone else, they just don't *feel* it.\n\nEDIT: Just to include some additional about your comment on \"extreme g forces\". Wether they're experiencing extreme g forces (say in a liftoff condition) or low g forces (while in orbit) they're still experiencing them as a body. It's just a matter of perception.",

Think if your job was to do something and you signed up for a 20 year stint for it only to face reality that due to limited space time available and astronauts to spread it over you'd only do that for maybe 8 months of your entire career. If you ended up having 15 months instead (or whatever this is, I think 15 is about right for Butch, more for Suni) do you really think you'd be upset?",

So it's not an appropriate word.\n\n> I never said I know better.

There is no way this can be true.\n\n> I said it was a complicated situation given the political climate and that we probably won't know their true feelings, despite what they might publicly say. That's not an unreasonable take\n\nYes, it's an unreasonable take. You are calling them liars because you know better what they wanted. They didn't have to say anything. All the conversations were in private and nothing needed to come out if it was problematic.\n\n> You can sign up for the Army, be put on some raid that's supposed to last X amount of time and if something gets cocked up due to materials or weather, or some other circumstance and you're there 30x longer than you thought you would be, most people would be upset.\n\nWhat if you spent a lot of effort to get into a program few are accepted for and you wanted to go space and then you went to space? You'd be upset?\n\nThey were *assigned* to this flight in the first place. There's no way to know what their desires were for how long they wanted to be there. But somehow you act like you know and that they are upset they are there longer. They got an assignment for one short flight with years of delay and somehow you turn this into an assumption they don't want to be in space. Even when they say they do. You're working hard to make this situation what you want it to be.\n\n> So on one hand, you chide me over having conjecture about what the astronauts were feeling\n\nLove it. When you say they are surely upset to be there that's cool. When I say that you need to look at it from the perspective of a person who signed up their career to go to space and doesn't expect to get a lot of space them then I'm the the one making stuff up.\n\nSure thing.\n\n> Reddit has such a hate-boner for anything Orange Man that we can't even be happy a couple of astronauts came home.\n\nYou're adept at making yourself the victim. This has nothing to do with you. And it has nothing to do with Trump except he and his pinhead friends are politicizing a decision NASA made. And you're doing it too.",

Their extended mission was due to **technical issues** with their return spacecraft, Boeing's **Starliner**, which experienced **thruster malfunctions and helium leaks**.\n\nOriginally, they were supposed to return **eight days** after their arrival at the **International Space Station (ISS)** in **June 2024**, but because NASA deemed the Starliner unsafe for reentry, they had to **remain on the ISS** while a safe return plan was developed.\n\nDuring their extended stay, they continued working on ISS tasks and research, but **they did not have a choice** about staying longer. NASA has since arranged for them to return to Earth via a **SpaceX Crew Dragon** capsule, which is expected to bring them back soon.\"",
