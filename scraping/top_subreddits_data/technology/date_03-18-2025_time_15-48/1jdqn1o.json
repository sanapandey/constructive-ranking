The more concrete the evidence, the better.\n\nMy State has seen a few of these Tolls scams going around the past year or two. They are taking advantage of the fact that my State recently switched from Cash Tolling to fully Cashless, and many people still aren't sure how to pay their tolls. There are signs on the toll roads saying the State will send them a bill, and at that point they can register for an online account to see and pay any future tolls. Or if they use EZ-Pass or Toll Tags, that the vehicle will debt the charges from the tag's toll account. Or they can dial a specific three digit star code to pay. But, with that said, the State never sends SMS for unpaid tolls.\n\nSome of the confusion I'm sure also comes from people mistaking SMS for E-mail, as you CAN send an e-mail to special SMS endpoints, and also text e-mails via SMS.",

I\u2019m 46- I grew up analog, but digital first started to take the stage when I was a teenager/early 20\u2019s. I usually recognize scams a mile away. I was tired and the timing was just spot fucking on. Fortunately I realized I might\u2019ve just fucked up and quickly changed my bank login password. Sure enough, I got several emails from the bank telling me someone was trying to log in with the wrong password. I narrowly avoided being completely wiped out. I\u2019m still not convinced there wasn\u2019t something fishy with the website where I paid that school fee, but I called them and they \u201cinvestigated\u201d it. My point is that these things seem to be getting a lot slicker. Either that or I\u2019m now so old that I\u2019m starting to be easier to trick. Or both.
