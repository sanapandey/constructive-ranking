They have no productive value. The cloud is an inherently flawed concept from a security stand point and the next generation of tech entrepreneurs are moving towards onsite, in house data-storage.\n\n\nAlways connected, remote data-stage protected by the kind of SaaS crap that Wiz offers seems to grow your attack surface by orders of magnitude. Ransomware is basically killing the cloud. It turns out that handing all your data over to a stranger makes it easier for other strangers to access your data. It seems like a no-brainer from a social engineering perspective but the industry refused to acknowledge the obvious until ransomware became a problem of epic proportions.\n\n\nGoogle buying Wiz as the industry abandons the cloud is a farce. The more you learn about tech mergers and buyouts the worse it looks. Google is part of a financing cartel that used to inflate the value of productive companies with useful products but now they're just systematically overpaying for worthless chits because that's the game. When a cartel company can't be inflated anymore, it's retired by being purchased by one of the cartel's top level consolidators; Microsoft, Apple, Google.",

Their big differentiator is that they do a really good job of helping you prioritize where to focus your remediation / best practice efforts. The dirty secret in the security industry is that we never actually fix every problem (it's simply not possible at scale), so we do our best to focus our remediation where we get the biggest bang for the buck. Wiz can gather context and helps deliver a prioritized list of what to fix and why. Previously this would have to be done by a fairly experienced security engineer and was quite the grind.",

                                                    "body": "Before I give an example, a quick reminder that Wiz is especially popular with orgs that have highly scaled deployments. In these situations you might have thousands or tens of thousands of workloads and there's not a single person at the organization who fully understands what all of them are for / what they do. And their names are like, \"battlecoin\" or \"walleye\" or some shit lol. \n\nIn the old way, you get a vulnerability notification that you have some package in a docker container and it is vulnerable to, let's say, remote code execution. Is that something you wake an engineer out of bed to fix? Can it wait a day? Can it wait a month? Can the vulnerability even be triggered? Does a code path exist which would allow exploitation? Is it a workload that you can reach from the public internet? Does that workload have access to really sensitive data? Does exploitation require having some sort of privileged position on the network / host, etc?\n\nAs you can imagine, you have to have somebody with quite a bit of domain expertise about your systems and the way they are designed to get that calculus right. \n\nWiz comes with a lot of really cool capabilities out of the box to help answer the prioritization question. For instance, it can actually resolve which S3 buckets a workload can read from, and Wiz will scan (sample) those S3 buckets to try to understand what the types of data stored within those are. It can also look at things like the network traffic path, and it can do that at a really deep level. So for example, it can resolve that a workload is public even if that workload is behind one or even two levels of load balancing.\n\nSo with Wiz, when we get a notification of some sort of critical issue, it is providing us all the context about why it's confident this is a big problem. This saves a tremendous amount of time and prevents a lot of human error in the investigation phase.\n\nWiz also just has a really good data collection capability. For example, if you have an SSH private key that has been lost or leaked or needs rotated for some reason, you can ask Wiz to give you a list of all the systems where that SSH pubkey has been placed within the authorized_users files. There are 100 little things like that within the solution which just makes life easier.\n\nThere are a lot of older competitors in this space (Lacework was probably the top dog until about 2022), and as Wiz started eating their lunch they tried to add more of these features. But those platforms just weren't designed for that and everything felt very much bandaged on. Lacework specifically eventually added some of these features, but it was too little too late, and their underlying data model is just not efficient. So if you do have a problem and you're trying to more deeply dive into it, you can't afford to sit there and wait 15 minutes for your query to return. And god help you if you didn't select the proper fields on the first try or something. Obviously I don't know the underlying technologies of Wiz but it's pretty clear they have some sort of graph database capability under the hood, and it can return results to complex queries with extreme haste.\n\nBut like I said, Wiz knows that they're the top dog and they charge accordingly. The price is already quite painful and Google will want to see a return on that investment. I'm afraid of getting priced out \ud83e\udee4",
