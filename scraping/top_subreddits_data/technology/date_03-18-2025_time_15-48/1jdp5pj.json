He did this a lot during his first term as well to hide the many controversies but this time is much different as he seems to no longer care about the controversies which is what should really worry people.\n\nHe's putting targets on elites, minorities, lgbtq, elderly, veterans, removing Black Medal of Honor recepients news articles, information about the Windtalkers in world wars, every demographic is under attack and the ones that think they're benefiting are only thinking that because it'd be stupid for him to attack supporters first while he lights things on fire. He's deepening divides that have always been in this country with every action and everyone seems to think it's a get rich scheme...\n\nWell, Republicans put together a [nice couple reports](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/publications/report-select-committee-intelligence-united-states-senate-russian-active-measures) detailing all the times his campaign interacted with Russians, how they benefited, and knew what the Russians were doing. Why wouldn't they do something? Well, why would they visit Russia on 4th of July? A lot of things aren't being answered due to the misdirection fogging things up. It's easy to fight each online, spread bullshit speculation, or get distracted by things that don't paint the full picture as people worry about when they'll be attacked again but in the big picture we really need to ask ourselves why's he doing this? \n\nA lot of people aren't interested in working with Republicans, saying they're getting what they deserve, which is exactly the kind of sentiment Trump is going for.

They provide short-term relief for some workers but don\u2019t address larger issues like income inequality, stagnant wages, or corporate tax loopholes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n2. **His Overall Tax Policies** \u2013 Trump's 2017 tax cuts heavily favored the wealthiest Americans and corporations. While some middle-class Americans saw temporary tax reductions, the biggest long-term benefits went to the richest individuals and large businesses. If his focus were truly on regular Americans, he'd be pushing for structural reforms that benefit the working and middle classes more significantly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n3. **Cuts to Social Programs** \u2013 While eliminating taxes on Social Security sounds beneficial, the bigger question is how he plans to fund Social Security in the long run. In the past, Trump has proposed cutting programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, which are crucial for regular Americans. If taxes are cut without alternative funding sources, these programs could be at risk.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n4. **Who Really Benefits?** \u2013 Even if certain tax breaks help workers, they don\u2019t fundamentally change the fact that the wealthy and corporations still get much larger benefits. If Trump were truly against elites profiting off workers' backs, he would take a harder stance on corporate tax avoidance, raising the minimum wage, and ensuring healthcare affordability\u2014none of which have been central to his policies.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n5. **Wait-and-See Approach** \u2013 This person says that \"proof will be in the results,\" but we already saw Trump's economic policies in action during his first term. Despite some short-term growth, wealth inequality widened, the rich got richer, and the national debt skyrocketed due to tax cuts favoring corporations and top earners. If the results didn\u2019t trickle down meaningfully then, why would they now?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIf Trump were truly fighting for the working class, why do billionaires and major corporations overwhelmingly support his policies?",

This is also in part because these corporations themselves are IP holders and/or service providers with stipulations that data hosted on their service may be used for this purpose.

I narrowed my scope from \"all AI\". Generative AI isn't all LLMs. It isn't all Mixture-of-Experts, either. It isn't all using Multi-head Latent Attention.\n\nNo AI needs to contain copyrighted works, whatsoever. That isn't a *requirement* for training. It's just desirable for most, for current intended purposes.\n\n---\n\nThey aren't talking reproduction. They are talking derivative works. And derivative works are *already protected by copyright*. They're asking for an exception. They're asking for generated content to be seen as fair use.\n\n> A \"derivative work\" is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a \"derivative work\". [United States Copyright Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101).\n\n---\n\n> There are no legal rules permitting the use of a specific number of words, a certain number of musical notes, or percentage of a work. [US, Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-fairuse.html)\n\nIf I turn around and build a new Star Wars universe, but don't mention Luke Skywalker, that's a derivative. I still have to get permission. It's not a reproduction, but it damn well ain't fair use.\n\n> This means our AI model training aligns with the core objectives of\ncopyright and the fair use doctrine, using existing works to create something wholly new\nand different without eroding the commercial value of those existing works.

The house and senate under the control of the people elected by the citizens of this country, just as they always have been. Nor has anything changed in the Judiciary.\n\nSeriously, what are you getting at? Political parties have won all three corners of the executive and legislative branches before. It's pretty common. Both W. and Obama also had such control at the beginning of their presidencies. This is how our democracy has always worked. Absolutely nothing has changed.\n\n>State houses, election offices. Literally any and all offices that can do anything related to elections.\n\nYou're still talking about ordinary people running for office and getting elected just as has happened for a couple hundred years. Actually, over those couple hundred years, much, much bigger changes have been made from time to time. From 2024 to 2025, litterally NOTHING HAS CHANGED in the process.\n\n>You think we have checks on power now ? Please explain to me what happens in 4 years. Do you seriously think that he just hands over power if/when he loses an \"election\".\n\n.... of course. Well, not Trump since he can't run. But whoever wins will peacefully take office just like has happened dozens of times.\n\nLet me turn this around on you. Are you telling me you seriously expect some kind of interruption of democracy? Really? Be honest now. What do YOU think that will look like? \n\nI'll be blunt. I have an easy job here. You ask me \"what happens in 4 years\", I just point at the same sequence of events that has happened every 4 years for hundreds of years. I don't really have to demonstrate anything because nothing has changed.\n\nThe burden is on you to show some event or factor that has completely altered that to the point of destruction. Go ahead, I'll wait.  \n\n\n>Let me say this again very slowly. America is done. That election was the end. Period. Full stop.\n\nOh, just grow up. If this is what you believe then there's no hope for you. What a stupid and weak belief to have. Do you have no agency? Are we all just helpless?\n\nNot a single thing you have said is even true! \"It's all in control of him now.\" is blatantly a lie. It's just ordinary fortunes of politics. At the midterm elections, a lot of power is going to swing, JUST LIKE IT ALWAYS DOES.\n\nI'm just going to say it again because it's the only valid answer to your paranoid screeching. *Nothing has changed*. And you have cited no changes in your comment.\n\n>FYI - I work at a Political science ThinkTank thats wheelhouse is global trade and digital security.\n\nI couldn't care less. You might as well have described yourself as a partisan hack, that's what all \"think tanks\" are. That PROVES your bias and hyperbolic nature. It reduces the value of your opinion. Like a \"scientist\" that works for the petroleum industry.\n\nYou're in the same category as the framers of 2025.\n\nI need only your own words to know how irrelevant your opinion is. You are treating the outcome of elections as some kind of fracturing of the political; process.... that's nuts. Parties win control of things. That's just how it works. And then they loose control. You have not cited a single things that has changed to prevent that.",
