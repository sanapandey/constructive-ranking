People weren't rushing out to buy Teslas, so what's up with that?\u00a0Sure, you might expect a slight uptick if they're cancelling rebate programs, but not like *that*.

Having spent the better part of the last decade in Dealerships myself, ranging from CDJR and Toyota up to JLR, there is **absolutely no chance** that's legitimate. 1,200 is a figure for an entire month, maybe, at a volume Dealership. In one day, all individual sales? There's a better chance of Helen Keller throwing a Snowball at an Igloo in Hell and hitting it, than that being any kind of legitimate.\n\nBest case scenario, they could've claimed to have misfiled those 1,200 sales and made an attempt to file correctly; **no**. When asked directly by a reporter, the **Store Manager** of that Tesla Dealership responded to the question of [Could it just be a case of misfiled paperwork, perhaps?], the SM responded with a deafening \"**I cannot comment.**\" [(sauce for that claim)](https://motorillustrated.com/suspicious-tesla-sales-surge-triggers-canadian-government-investigation/149947/) Bro. The out was there, they spoonfed you the ability to clear the air and fly this one under the radar. Declined. Denied. Allegations = Unbeaten.\n\nI don't think the SM was incompetent from a PR standpoint, either, especially with reading all the articles that have come out about it in the following days. It's gonna come out from Canadian Investigations that these were falsified sales meant to prop up financial figures, specifically financials that qualify Tesla for what are called \"EV Tax Credits\" iirc, which is what Tesla sells to other larger corporations to offset their emissions-based taxes. Without these EV Tax Credits, Tesla would be quickly underwater and insolvent. If I understand it correctly, those Credits are basically the lifeline that Tesla lives off of, and one of Musk's more liquid assets that he leverages in the overall Tesla/SpaceX/Boring Company business structure.",

When asked (right after the trial) which criterion had not been met, the foreman said \"I can't remember\"... and then later claimed it was because it wasn't reasonable to assume the tweets were about Unsworth.",

Back when Tesla started launching their advanced ADAS features a decent resolution Lidar would have set you back a few tens of thousands.\n\nI used to work on Autonomous vehicles at work, our early development vehicles had 3x 16 channel Lidars that cost $30k per vehicle and they were mostly useless because the resolution was too low to perform proper feature detection.\n\nThe earlier lidars also had tons of reliability issues because the early ones would all spin at quite high speeds and the motors would wear out. You'd never be able to put them on a production ready car with a plausible 2 decade lifespan.\n\nNowadays the technology has improved a lot (high resolution sensors without moving parts like the one on the car in Mark Rober's video) and the sensors are much much cheaper than they used to be.\n\nRealistically Tesla _should_ consider adding Lidar to their new vehicles, but ultimately they went all-in on the idea that it could be done camera only (which seems plausible to me, given humans can, but it's not clear that it'll not take much longer than with LIDARs). Not only do they have a lot of ground to catch-up on (they'd need to build new machine learning capability to train models and build a lidar data set) but they also already made the promise that their current vehicles without Lidars could be FSD. I imagine Tesla will continue to pretend that they should continue with Camera only because the alternative is too expensive.",

Having seen a lot of the commentary and how Elmo operates, it's pretty clear he thinks that software can compensate for any lack of hardware. \n\nBasically, his logic is that so long as the hardware input matches the input a human brain gets, the rest can be done with software. The issue with that is threefold. \n\nFirst, we aren't even close to mimicking the human brain in it's full capacity. We can mimic aspects in isolated systems, but the whole is still very far away. \n\nSecond, with additional hardware, the software side gets a lot simpler and easier. \n\nThird, It has to be better than the human brain because people are going to be less cautious with it and yet will have a lower tolerance for failure. For example, if I'm driving in a snowstorm, I know my own limitations on what information I'm getting, such that I'm going to drive slower, and adjust my driving style to match the road conditions. With self driving, people won't inherently know the limitations and will be more likely to drive at the speed limit instead of slowing down to give the computer more time to detect and react.\n\nWithout radar and lidar, full self driving is pretty much going to be exclusively limited to clear dry roads. Great for California, not so great if you live in a place that has a proper winter, or gets a lot of rain or snow.",

They have a much lower resolution and have noisier point clouds. IIRC the main reason for removal initially was due to supply chain issues. \n\nOne of the reasons why Radars can be super valuable in autonomous vehicles is because they can give you incredibly accurate relative velocity in the longitudinal plane (Essentially the doppler effect - they can measure the change in frequency to tell how fast individual points are at moving towards or away from the vehicle). This makes them great for adaptive cruise control because you can get a good reading for how fast the vehicle in front is moving.\n\nRadars outside of that aren't super useful, and I can believe Elon's claim that the cars mostly behave better without them. Because of how noisy the point clouds are you generally have to ignore any points that are stationary so you'd never use Radar for collision detection on a static object (e.g. a wile coyote wall).\n\nRadars also have other issues in certain environmental conditions like snow.",

Try to imagine any other company that: \n\n1. Has only produced a single new car in 5 years that is absolutely a flop on every level. Very low sales, multiple recalls of the entire model and even with the tiny sales it has seems to generate a new headline every week like \"don't take your cybertruck out in the rain or it completely stops working.\" \n2. Is beset on all sides by competition after squandering a fairly large lead and has virtually no product differentiation. Just about the only novel thing about Tesla was an all EV that didn't look like and drive like a golf cart, lots of others have caught that. \n3. See also: the entire line has been getting a ton of fair criticism that the build quality isn't befitting a $16k Kia, much less a $70k+ \"luxury\" car and getting them serviced is a nightmare.\n3. Has virtually no where to go. Other markets don't even have to pretend to care about Elon, and where Tesla really needs to be successful in places like China, they have BYD with which they are not even close to competitive on features and especially price. \n4. Is now notorious for vaporware. FSD is coming \"next year\" for nearly a decade, CT is basically \"bulletproof\" but can't even stand up against a ball in a staged event, and the list goes on.\n6. And then there is Elon. Try to imagine literally any other company in the state that Tesla is in that has a CEO that is: a) extremely generously part-time b) spending all of their time posting verifiable nonsense on social media c) doing nazi salutes on stage d) is actively denigrating its main customer base in all of this e) is actively working to make it so fewer people can even afford a Tesla. And that's to keep it brief. \n7. With a BOARD DOING NOTHING. Even if you know that Tesla is run by Elon like I would let my toddler drive by handing them their Playskool wheel in their carseat just the fact that the board does nothing about any of this is enough of a sign that sane people should not own this stock. \n\nThat TSLA hasn't sank like an absolute rock is the real mystery.",

If you read that reddit reply his fanboys always love to trot out as an example of how well he responded to such issues, he never actually even acknowledges such things as problems in and of themselves, but that the *execution* of all the deeply problematic things they do was handled poorly. He also slimely entirely failed to address the human trafficking, misogyny, and awful cultlike behavior of the church and make the issue entirely about lgbtq issues when asked as a distraction. Absolutely spineless and unscrupulous about the plight of others unless it affects his paycheck (such as the thing with Amazon), a sizable portion of which he gives to his church so they can keep funding active hate groups. The asshole even had the gall to state, indirectly, that having several token gay characters in his books does more to help lgbtq people than donating millions towards groups actively seeking to harm them.

Nothing you said was convincing, or had any grace. your a loose cannon.\n\nI'm gunna go drive my 10MPG jeep with massive rubber tires out on my land now and shoot my AR-15 at paper targets. I must have sold my soul to capitalism and have too much money if I can afford to waste $120 on bullets on a monday afternoon, I must support nazis because I think the trendy hippie car seems cool even if it is electric. I must have stolen this land from Indians. I must evil because I have a AR15. I must hate minorities and the various communities that are currently under attack. This must be true... because you can just lump millions of people together with zero nuance. Its not like what's happening in American and our administration is a massively complex and a hard problem, we need to fix this shit. But calling everyone nazis makes you look dumb and its not helping.\n\nGet with the program and help the reasonable people of America get control from both the extreme right and left. unity will get us where we wanna be, not fighting and name calling.",

I do think it also provides a useful insight for people to understand the technology anyways. A big part of the reason Tesla is currently over valued is the expectation of autonomous driving popping off with a software update. There are millions of teslas around the world and the chance that an update could suddenly roll out making them all fully autonomous would make their value astronomical. So showing people publicly data like this should educate people on the risks and honestly, potentially lower the value even more as it lowers the likelihood that it\u2019s even feasible.",

His format is usually just wacky experiments where he or another engineer builds some wacky device to prove things.  A lot of people own TESLAs (including popular youtubers) were blindsided by the behavior of the CEO. There were certain stages of accepting this... Some had enough at the cave diver pedo comments for example, and some right up until the sieg hiel.  In my opinion lets welcome all the different levels.   I'm looking for how popular youtubers cope with this in different ways. I get the sense from this take he knew the TESLA was going to fail these experiments before he ran them.  I see this as his contribution to take a jab at TESLA's cost cutting decision to omit LiDAR in their design.",

While speculation plays a role in stock prices, especially in growth stocks, there are fundamental metrics that investors use to evaluate a company's worth, things like earnings, revenue growth, profit margins, and debt levels. Traditional automakers like Toyota and GM have stock prices that are largely tied to these fundamentals.\n  \nTesla, on the other hand, has been valued more like a tech startup than a car company, based on future potential rather than current performance. That\u2019s not inherently bad, a lot of companies are valued similarly.  But it does mean that a lot of Tesla\u2019s stock price was based on belief in Elon Musk\u2019s vision, rather than just numbers on a balance sheet.\n  \nThe rise of individual investors and social media hype has definitely contributed to some wild valuations in recent years (not just with Tesla), often disconnected from traditional valuation models. The market isn\u2019t always rational, and stocks can swing based on sentiment as much as financials. But when sentiment shifts, those sky-high valuations can come crashing down.",

I suspect the price will fall a lot more especially if the next earnings report is bad. Even the techbros don't want to be left holding the bag if Tesla declines.",

Elon seems to be changing vehicles, from Tesla to Starlink to controlling the government itself. He is going all in into becoming a state-enforced oligarch. Hopefully he crashes before that happens, people are doing their best to punish him for his unhinged behavior.",

In fact, I would argue that this is the normal outcome under Republican policies. As a specific example, tariffs are regressive, meaning that they disproportionately affect lower income and working family households. Income taxes, on the other hand, are progressive, which means that income tax cuts primarily benefit high income earners and the wealthy.",

If he can hold onto stock that has a more balanced valuation and step back from operations it would put him in a position where he he could eventually pull even more out of it down the road.

Until that time, the stock price will continue to fall, allowing him, and his cronies, to buy stock back up at lower prices. \n\nEverything he does drives the price down.

What I find fascinating is how little the actual car business matters to analysts one guy values the entire vehicle manufacturing part at just $40 per share while putting hundreds of dollars of value on the self driving tech that's still in development.\n\nMusk's political stuff definitely isn't helping, but the sales dip from the Model Y refresh is probably temporary. Still, when your stock is valued mostly on future robotaxi promises rather than current revenue, you're super vulnerable to sentiment shifts. Weird that most analysts still have Buy ratings with targets way above the current price. Either they see something the market doesn't, or they're slow to adjust to reality.",

They've already shown a propensity for pump and dump style crypto schemes and rug pulling. Using the executive office to do it through not only a trump coin but melania as well. At what point to we start to ask if this is a pattern they are profiting off of? It's become a very predictable loss and rally the last month.\n\n\nThey have so much control over perception right now it's unreal. Both in a positive and negative sense. Not even just using the white house lawn and oval office to sell cars or say dumb shit that caters the stock price. But using x to amplify these sentiments depending on what they want the stock to do.\u00a0\n\n\nI feel crazy like tin foil hat conspiracy shit cause it cannot be that obvious. But it also feels that obvious. People wanna see musk lose it all so bad they can't see how he may be profiting off this. I mean the guy just spent another 100million on influence. What more do we need to see. This isn't killing him. It's making him richer. At least that's my opinion. They are straight up treating these stocks like it's crypto scams. It's the same playbook.

More interesting is how long can this down trend last and what would cause the slide to stop or potentially reverse?\n\nMy thinking is based on the price/earnings (P/E)ratio which is roughly 15 times higher than GM's. The definition is simple enough per investopedia  P/E Ratio = Stock Price \u00f7 EPS, where EPS is earnings per share. \n\nPart of Tesla's high valuation is based on the claim made by Musk that Tesla is more than a car company being also an AI company, and a robotics company making Tesla a small herd of unicorns. DeepSeek being free means AI is not going to be a major source of income: Senator Josh Hawley wants a $1,000,000 fine and 20 years in jail for people downloading DeepSeek and US top AI companies e.g. OpenAI are asking Trump to ban DeepSeek. You don't do that stuff unless your apple cart gets blown up real good.  As to humanoid robots, the real stuff not Tesla's actors in robot costumes sham, China is developing those too and they will be priced like inexpensive China EVs not Tesla's overpriced offerings. iRobot, makers of the Roomba robot vacuum cleaner is filling for Chapter 11 because competition: other makers have lower prices and better features. \n\nAs Tesla's vehicle sales shrink/collapse Tesla's revenue also falls and that makes the P/E go up unless of course the share price falls to compensate.\n\nAll Tesla big markets are shrinking. In China domestic equivalents are cheaper and packed full of better features, in the US Musk and Trump are busy pissing California (biggest EV market) and rich liberals while the MAGA morons still love rolling coal.  In Europe Musk's anti union stance, messing around in local politics, and defending Hitler massively pissed off the locals. Trump starting a tariff war with the EU also negatively impacts Tesla due to Musk's role in Trump's administration.\n\nSo how low can Tesla stock drop? Penny stock? Zero?  Unknowable at the moment but I'm remembering that Richard Feynman lecture \"There's plenty of room at the bottom.\"\n\nAs always, interesting times.",
