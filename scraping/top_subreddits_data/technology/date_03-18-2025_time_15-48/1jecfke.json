Here's a snippet for more context: \n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s Federal Trade Commission has removed four years worth of business guidance blogs as of Tuesday morning, including important consumer protection information related to artificial intelligence and the agency\u2019s landmark privacy lawsuits under former chair Lina Khan against companies like Amazon and Microsoft. More than 300 blogs were removed.\n\nOn the FTC\u2019s website, the page hosting all of the agency\u2019s\u00a0[business-related blogs and guidance](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance)\u00a0no longer includes any information published during former president Joe Biden\u2019s administration, current and former FTC employees, who spoke under anonymity for fear of retaliation, tell WIRED. These blogs contained advice from the FTC on how big tech companies could avoid violating consumer protection laws.\n\nOne now deleted blog, titled\u00a0[\u201cHey, Alexa! What are you doing with my data?\u201d](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/06/20-million-ftc-settlement-addresses-microsoft-xbox-illegal-collection-kids-data-game-changer-coppa)\u00a0explains how, according to two FTC complaints, Amazon and its Ring security camera products allegedly leveraged sensitive consumer data to train the ecommerce giant\u2019s algorithms. (Amazon disagreed with the FTC\u2019s claims.) It also provided guidance for companies operating similar products and services. Another post titled\u00a0[\u201c$20 million FTC settlement addresses Microsoft Xbox illegal collection of kids\u2019 data: A game changer for COPPA compliance\u201d](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/06/20-million-ftc-settlement-addresses-microsoft-xbox-illegal-collection-kids-data-game-changer-coppa)\u00a0instructs tech companies on how to abide by Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act by using the 2023 Microsoft settlement as an example. The settlement followed\u00a0[allegations by the FTC that Microsoft obtained data](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/06/ftc-will-require-microsoft-pay-20-million-over-charges-it-illegally-collected-personal-information)\u00a0from children using Xbox systems without the consent of their parents or guardians.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the message to industry on what our compliance expectations were, which is in some ways the most important part of enforcement action, they are trying to just erase those from history,\u201d a source familiar tells WIRED.\n\nRead the full story:\u00a0[https://www.wired.com/story/federal-trade-commission-removed-blogs-critical-of-ai-amazon-microsoft/](https://www.wired.com/story/federal-trade-commission-removed-blogs-critical-of-ai-amazon-microsoft/)\u00a0",
