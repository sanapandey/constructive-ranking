Who can make the most the cheapest and who is more advanced. Everyone then naturally ends up relying on them for everything increasing their wealth, power, and control over all those that come to them. They aren't playing with petty rules and regulations. That's why all countries jobs are getting replaced by machines made in China and all parts/support is from china as well. Every other country needs to either do what they can to keep up or fall behind and be subservient accepting what happens to them. No matter what you will not have a job and you WILL be replaced either way. One just gives your country a chance of a foundation for a better chance at jobs staying there for a tech job or manufacturing job at least if you're the one's ahead.\n\nDoesn't matter about your morals and ethics it will continue without you and leave you in the past as everyone else around you progresses because countries like China is not gonna stop progressing technology. Look at all our old ass people crying about \"back in my day\" and everyone responds with \"It's not how it was back in the early 1900's anymore grandpa; stuff doesn't work like that anymore\".
