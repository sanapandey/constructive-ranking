The market is being flooded with used Tesla which drives the value down and makes people not want to buy new. \n\n\nIt\u2019s tough for me to see the brand ever being cool again, which does matter. I would be really surprised if the brand could survive as like a Midwest MAGA soccer mom car. There\u2019s definitely a market there, but that means Tesla\u2019s sales have 100% peaked, and for a car company, that\u2019s not good news. \n\n\nThe board should try to remove Elon.
