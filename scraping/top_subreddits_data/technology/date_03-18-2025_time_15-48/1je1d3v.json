Within a month after registering it in my state, I started getting tons of junk mail from extended warranty companies trying to sell me an extended warranty on it.\n\nThe reason I'm sure it was my state's DMV that sold my info is that the vehicle descriptor on the official DMV paperwork, title, and registration was odd and not used by the auction house or anybody else involved.  But the junk mail I got all used that strange descriptor.  IIRC it was something like \"2014 GMC TK\".",

For the extended warranty companies, it's a race to get you to sign up with their company before you receive ads from all the other companies.

About 15 years ago I created a fairly sophisticated property info site for the 600,000 or so parcels of land in Austin, TX (technically Travis County as that\u2019s where land is managed).  Not like Zillow or something, it was just super data rich and had all kinds of \u201cprivate\u201d details. \n\nI wrote it just because the public county one was lacking so much info and didn\u2019t join all of the data from other public entities that happened to be relevant to land. \n\nAnyway, it got a surprising amount of hate from the nicer neighborhoods as people thought I\u2019d somehow harvested private data. I hadn\u2019t. 100% of it was bought from the county for $80. At the time they\u2019d put it on a DVD in a series of giant CSV files. 100% of it was public information. Every county was required to keep and make available the data \u201cfor a reasonable price\u201d. I only ever used Travis county. \n\nSo my argument to people used to be that I kind of agreed - some of that data probably should NOT be available, but you\u2019ll have to take it up with the government since they\u2019re the ones making it public.",

Trump did what fascists do and lie he acknowledged that yes there was economic difficulty so he told people these other people are the problem and here's how I'm going to do something about it. Every interview for Biden and Kamala they said the economy was doing and working fine, they didn't bother developing an answer to it because it didn't align with their class politics. It doesn't align with Trump's either but he's not in this to be honest, he's in this to grow his own power.\n\nHowever, are some of those people fucking racist shit heads? Yes.

Most of their sales are the model Y and the model 3.  Roughly the same price as a new Toyota RAV4 hybrid, but the tesla isn\u2018t burning fossil fuels for the rest of its life. People who bought the car years ago bought it because they were being environmentally conscience. That\u2019s what I did, and it was a big fucking stretch financially to do that, but as a progressive, I felt it was important to reduce my contribution to climate change.\n\nNow that I know that Musk an evil asshole, I\u2019d like to have a different car, but I CANNOT afford it right now. I can afford a very cheap used gas car, but I will not go back to a gas car and contributing to the damage done to the whole earth on an existential level for humans and other animals. Getting another EV right is too much for me financially. I can\u2019t go without a vehicle, I live in an area with no public transportation. Not everything is as black and white people would love to make it. Life is complicated, and it\u2019s important to have enough empathy to see the nuance. People who bought this car years ago are not supporting Elon Musk.\n\nEdit\u2026 additional idea\n\nGroups like Dogequest shouldn\u2019t be threatening Tesla owners. Instead, they should  be sending stickers/window clings to every owner with saying something along the lines of \u201cI will not buy a Tesla again.\u201d (They could even have fun with it and make it look like you\u2019re writing the sentence over and over again on a blackboard as punishment from the teacher.) The advantage of doing it this way is that every time the car is taken in for service Tesla employees are going to see current customers that they will be losing as the years go by. This will help create pressure inside the company as current sales dwindle and future sales are bleak. It also spreads the Tesla regret to the general public.  Would you be interested in buying a car that most of the current owners regret having?\n\nThis would be way more effective than property damage. Most Americans do not like extremism, and vandalizing or damaging others property is seen as extreme by most Americans and most voters. That\u2019s a good way to get people to ignore your message and dismiss everything you have to say.",

Do you think that all Teslas being tossed into a tire fire will somehow create world peace?\n\nwhere am i saying any of these things in this thread? is MostlyHereForKeKs here in the room with you now?\n\nThe very simple message, which appears way too complex for you, chuckles, is that the average tesla owner could totally afford to sell them.  that the claim that there are all the throngs of hard-working taxi driving single mothers that own teslas and (clutches pearls) will be devastated if they sell them are **just lies**.\n\nYou are asking some mildly reasonable questions, in that mangled dross of a post.  But the absolute lack of reading comprehension skills on evidence here prevents us discussing them.  This whole thread is an absolute shitshow of bad faith, bad reasoning, and ill intent.\n\nperhaps if you would stop being a reactive arsehole and **just fucking making up** what you want the other person to say, that would be nice.\n\n>And then you quote statistics that will become completely irrelevant...\n\nThose are current facts about the current state of affairs.  Like you may not like them, but they are facts. ikr, so inconvenient!\n\n>These cars will eventually end up in the hands of people who can't afford to sell them for a loss.\n\nThis is what happens with all cars.  Have you heard of 'used cars' that they sell on these things called 'used car lots'?  And have you heard of these things called 'junk yards' where they put cars once the alien and magical process of 'depreciation' has had its way with them?\n\nffs.\n\n>so that you can label whoever finally keeps it as a nazi?\n\nThis is also part of this thing that you may have heard of, called 'capitalism'.  Items or services are exchanged via fungible units of exchange, and their value is based upon a complex interaction between scarcity and psychology called 'supply and demand'.\n\nSo yes, while it has nothing to do with me or what l think, classical economic theory says that if people sell their tesla *because it is associated with being a nazi*, eventually only *self-identified nazis* will own them.  yadda yadda adam smith, yadda yadda invisible hand, whha whha market forces, no shit sherlock.\n\nffs^(2)",

Once all the **original** owners of Tesla cars sell them off to the poors, you'll have no beef with Tesla owners anymore. That's pretty fair, thanks for clarifying. Hopefully everyone that does vandalism can tell the difference between original and secondhand ownership!\n\nHave a good one!",

Certainly no one should be buying a new Tesla now.  And I fully support people who already have them selling them.  But really the ones already sold should be used and driven.  Rebadge them or what ever!  I think that in and of itself proves a point.  But Ssuggesting all Teslas should be off the road.  Thats crackers.",

Its leadership actively amplifies and profits from Nazi ideology, driving harmful policies that hurt hospitals, universities, and countless communities. Every tweet, every interaction, every moment spent on that platform strengthens the very forces undermining democracy.\n\nThere\u2019s an old saying: if you walk into a bar and there\u2019s a Nazi there, it\u2019s a Nazi bar. The same applies to Twitter. If you stay, if you engage, if you keep posting as if nothing has changed, you\u2019re helping normalize a platform that empowers fascism. Silence isn\u2019t neutrality\u2014it\u2019s complicity.\n\nThe solution is simple: disengage. Deactivate your account. Urge Democratic officials, companies, universities, and media outlets to do the same. Twitter is vulnerable\u2014it relies on engagement to survive. By walking away, we deny it the legitimacy and revenue it needs to operate.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about rejecting a toxic platform; it\u2019s about taking a stand against those who use it to spread hate and misinformation. Deactivate your account and remove the icon from your website. Make it impossible for any credible institution to justify staying. The fight against fascism starts with refusing to give it a platform.\n\nWe all need to do the right thing now before it\u2019s too late.\n\nRespectfully,",

It's the insistence on running unpopular candidate after unpopular candidate, and the inability to learn from their mistakes. It's also this insistence that everything has to be played 'by the rules' when they other team threw out the rule book 20 years ago. It's caving to their opposition instead of diggin their heels in and fighting (looking at you spineless Schumer!)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEvery single poll prior to Trump 2015 said that Bernie beats Trump beats Hilary beats Bernie.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd what happened?
