The iPhone of cars will eventually arrive.\u00a0\n\n\n(and if I knew exactly what that was I'd be rich rather than sitting here wasting time on Reddit).\u00a0",

Have a capacitor bank that is just held at the ready and re-charged in-between cars.  Maybe they could do somethign in a car if they have a capacitor system that can gradually store power to a battery?  That way you could charge quickly and leave but then mitigate the leakage issue",

This was the aforementioned teething issues. If you're swapping 2-3x a day, then your battery will get beaten up far too quickly. This is what killed the scheme in china. It caused too many battery failures and fires.\n\nA fully automated system with an overhead crane can do it, but you need every truck stop to have a multi million dollar swapping station and at least two of each battery size. Then you need maintenance staff, and you need to regularly bring in batteries from elsewhere. All this on top of the charging hardware (which either needs to be as capable as the non swapping version or you need more buffer batteries).\n\nIt also has a huge impact on the design of the truck, which is much more important.",

Also as the previous poster said, a lot of the more recently built coal is used as backup when the energy provided by renewables is lower (for example they had droughts in 2023 which means they had less hydro power available so they had to make up the difference using coal).\n\nOn average, coal as a percentage of their total energy mix has been steadily declining over the last few years. It was around 75% in 2016 and it's now close to 50% with a downwards trend",

And the people downvoting me simply don\u2019t understand how electricity works. I am not saying this is a bad tech nor am I saying it doesn\u2019t work. I am saying that the resistances required to contain 1500v to get 1MW is crazy high - you would need 700 amps of current to reach that power. The higher the voltages, the higher the risks. 600V will still kill you but it\u2019s much easier to contain 600V over 1500V. \n\nMath ain\u2019t that hard.",

Where did I say I\u2019m an engineer pal? And I will not disclose my \u201cauthority\u201d, even though I never once pushed said authority??? Or attempted to\u2026 But it truly doesn\u2019t matter what I say to you, you\u2019re an engineer. I know plenty, have many as friends and coworkers, I know how that degree makes most of you feel superior to those without. Let me ask you, do you have your PE? Do you have first hand experience dealing with power generation OR power generation design and implementation? Bet you don\u2019t\u2026 Just because I don\u2019t design a system doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t understand how it works, same applies to you. But let me break everything down for you so you can understand it all. \n\nWhen talking to people regarding electricity, who typically follow conventional flow, saying electricity is being PUSHED by the voltage is true enough for most people to understand. Similar to that of a water pipe and its pressure. Except once you get into resistances the water pipe analogy kind of goes out the window (larger conductor means less resistance means more current, the same isn\u2019t true for water pressure).  \n\nDo the semantics truly matter? I think not tbh. You\u2019re trying to call me out for something that I do know about, and it\u2019s very easy for anyone who knows anything about electricity from an elementary engineering point of view to recognize the dangers of Human + Electricity = Potential disaster. Same applies for combustibles and other energy sources. Each have their own innate dangers and risks. Electricity and its risks have been solved as you stated, so why do people get electrocuted? \n\nSo if I am not an engineer, it therefore means I don\u2019t design the systems correct? Agreed! That\u2019s one thing we agree on, yay! Instead I ensure it is safe for the end user AKA the client, AKA the consumer. I am very well aware that engineers don\u2019t typically think of the practicality of most of their designs or how they will be implemented. \n\nI am also NOT against EVs like this echo chamber of a sub somehow thinks I am. Just try to read what I said instead of getting upset about the potential dangers of holding the equivalent of a service feeder in your hand. Is there danger just by it being there? NO. That is not what I\u2019m saying nor implying. Never once did I state that these will kill people just cause. My initial comment was regarding shielding failure.",

But he's still correct - 1500v is extraordinarily difficult to properly insulate, and certainly not within the realm of materials and components to be handled by Joe Public. And if we're charging an EV battery pack then we're probably somewhere in the range of 500 kW, at 1500v that's going to be about 300 amps and even with a DC GFCI device shutting it down quickly, you would not want to survive getting zapped by that.",

And thanks for the intro to voltage video! I will explain why this has nothing to do with anything we are talking about in just a moment. After reading the article again, and doing a little more research - the battery packs are 1000V and are at 810kwh. The chargers operate at 1000kw, AKA 1 MEGAWATT. Which is why it can charge 810kw in 5 minutes!!! Crazy huh. I know engineering is hard, so I don\u2019t expect everyone to understand it. But did you know you can hold 1000000000000 volts and live! As long as you\u2019re grounded, OR as long as the amperage is near zero and therefore has no power. Death by electrocution requires roughly 50 voltage (there are exceptions especially when you get to very high amperages or your skin is wet) to pass through our skin, and then a high enough current to cause damage, plus time exposed to said current.

What was wrong with my statement of 1000000000000000 volts, as long as the amperage (the current) is sooooo low, once it does overcome skins resistance, it won\u2019t kill you. Want to know a perfect example of this\u2026. Well not 1000 blah blah blah volts, but static electricity. It is enough volts to literally cause an arc. 25kV+ at times. Thats plenty enough voltage to get through the skin. Why aren\u2019t we all dead?! We\u2019ve all been shocked by static electricity before right? \n\nYou can have 50v touch you and live, same with 200kv. It all depends on the path of the current (where it grounds), the exposure time to said current, and the amount of current flowing. If your power supply has a differential of 200kV but a power supply of microamps and you\u2019re only exposed to it for fractions of a second - you\u2019re totally fine! If you hold onto a 50v circuit and your power supply is rated to provide milliamps, or amps, you may as well be toast. \n\nThe CURRENT is what causes the damage, not the voltage. The voltage dictates the current but the current of the circuit can not be greater than what is being produced by the supply. It generally takes 50+ volts to pass through the skin barrier, once inside your body your resistance may as well be ZERO. But you keep going on with your googling bud. I\u2019ll give you a tip, try looking up Van de Graaf generators. The voltages are crazy high with a continuous low current. If static electricity was continuous, we\u2019d all be dead for sure. But thankfully that\u2019s not how static works\u2026 Do you want me to also explain to you how static discharge is the flow of electrons from a more negatively charged source to a more positively charged?",

If you have any kind of lead off of your generation source, you indeed can have a power supply of microamps at high voltage. Like I just said in my comment, a Van de Graaf generator for fucks sake man. \n\nIf you have a power supply of a 9V battery - and you try to pull a load of greater than like\u2026 an Amp I think, maybe it was 0.1 I can\u2019t remember, the voltage will drop heavily as power draw increases. But the point is the amount of total power in said battery isn\u2019t much at all compared to the battery of an EV. So. Like my previous statement, if you had a MICROAMP POWER SUPPLY pushing HIGH VOLTAGE (yes I know I fucked up by switching the verbiage, sue me), but are only exposed to if for milliseconds if not nanoseconds, you can live no problem. It only takes roughly 0.2mA across your heart to kill you. That\u2019s a 9V battery directly to the heart. If your voltage is high, and your amperage is high, time doesn\u2019t matter. If your voltage is high, your amperage is low, time is CRUCIAL when figuring life or death.",

We aren\u2019t talking about 120v extension cords pushing 5 amps man. We are talking exponentially higher. The risk of dying from an extension cord is VERY low. Even with the human ability to destroy that cord in every which way possible yet keep it working. Now, apply that same line of thinking to an extension cord that is literally able to power a whole house. Sure, as is, the cord is engineered and designed 100% to have no fault or error. I agree. I am not talking about the engineering or design. I am purely speaking of human error and interaction. The possibility for a human to trip over it, to swing it around like it\u2019s a toy, or constant use such as bending or warping causing wear in the internal conductors causing a break which would melt the insulation quickly and once through, would shock and probably electrocute everyone nearby. \n\nWith power at this level, the risk is much higher compared to an extension cord. The current implementation for EV chargers is begging for death. Current EV chargers in America cause shocks and injury, but fail safes keep those cases as injuries and not death. When you crank the power up 10x, those fail safes need to be even more strenuous and bulky. Unless we discover some sort of new superconductor that takes up next to no space in which case - cool.",

While the concept of holding a battery charger with voltage and current is the same, the risk doesn\u2019t scale the same. With increased current requirements comes increased conductor size, which comes with increased insulation/shielding size. Current EV chargers use several failsafe features to prevent electrocution such as power won\u2019t flow till fully seated, and locking ports etc. I\u2019m sure as well as a basic GFCI somewhere in the mix. There have been many many many cases of people being shocked, and badly, by chargers of these sizes. They\u2019re only shocked because of the safety features. I am NOT downplaying this tech whatsoever, I am very excited for it to work and be implemented properly. But if you try and hold a battery charger plug with 1500V with roughly 600+ amps running through it, it\u2019ll be a much different experience than one 1/10th the size. A nick in insulation or a partial failure of the safety features on a 800v/300kwh charger can cause a shock. Imagine if it was 10x as strong.

If there is a problem it's very unlikely that both ends of the charge won't recognize there's something wrong. Furthermore, The EVSE cable is never energized unless it's plugged in, locked into place, and a car has started communicating. The initial communication is done over low voltage, and once the EVSE and car agree it is safe to charge, only then is the cable fully energized. The car tells the EVSE how much power to supply, and if the car ever stops telling the EVSE how much power to supply, it stops supplying power.\n\nI'm sure you know all this but I don't want people reading worst case scenarios and assuming that L3 chargers are constant high voltage beacons of death to anyone around them as if an engineer didn't already consider the possible dangers of handing end users a 10x concentrated Magic Smoke dispenser",

I am only speaking of the elevated risk of introducing larger, movable, operable, bulky components to a standard consumers daily life. And then of course the exponential increase to the risk of death involved with larger power sources. \n\nIf using a 120v extension cord has an imaginary death factor of 1. A 240V doesn\u2019t have an imaginary death factor of 2, it\u2019s an exponential increase in risk. It\u2019s the same concept of working with 10000V or 100V, the concepts are all the same.

No, you should not be putting your car into launch mode and accelerating to 150 MPH on a residential road. But the fact that you *can* do that if you want is an interesting problem to think about.\n\nThese cars are just as easy to drive as \"normal\" car...if you are gentle on the throttle and are a good defensive driver who minds the rules of the road. On the other hand, if you stomp on the accelerator, you will find that driving a road car at 150 MPH is actually a lot more difficult than driving one at 70 MPH is!",

Is China just giving the US free money if we choose to agree to import it at those subsidized prices?\n\nIf China is subsidizing R&D (as opposed to subsidizing each production car), then clearly that subsidy has benefitted China and benefits the world in helping with climate change. The US subsidizes a lot of R&D here too (for instance grants to Universities, or defense companies/NASA etc.), and yes the world benefits from that subsidy too.",

Not only that, EVs have 100x less moving parts than a gas engine, so they don't need massive linear assembly lines like gas cars do. So having \"forced labor\" is actually a burden lmao. This is cheap stupid propaganda that doesn't even make sense.\n\nWanna know why EVs are cheap as hell in China? Because their government actually cares for the industry - Chinese automakers have insane levels of vertical integration of ALL components, and they enjoy massive subsidies. Sounds like a western skill issue to me.",

Then the Chinese government pumped billions into their solar industry.

As you said, China has pumped billions into their solar industry - but not subsidization, rather research and development.  They've been the top leader in renewable energy development for a long time now.  \n\nSecondly, they have a competitive advantage of being on the world's biggest and most accessible source of rare earth minerals.  \n\nIt more than makes sense for them to have overtaken everyone else in solar production in particular, considering this fact.  They do subsidize some industries to a degree, but the biggest challenge for other countries is just that their production capacity is so dang huge.  To put it into perspective, 1.4 billion population in China and Germany has 83 million.  For the sake of comparison, let's say normal production of solar panels uses 5% of the population to produce a number of panels to fulfill domestic needs or 4.15 million in Germany and 70 million in China.  Increasing production rate of panels in China by 20% would produce an additional 14 million, which would fill Germany's needs 3 times over.  Yet, Germany would have to dedicate their entire population to producing solar panels in order to do the same.  \n\nMy point being, large countries don't...actually need to subsidize their products in order to accidentally drown out domestic production.  Their size alone means that they need only slightly increase production to absolutely dominate foreign markets if it's something they are good at.  \n\nUSA hesitancy towards China is largely grown out of this happening in the Clinton years, when tariffs were suddenly lowered on China, and unlike with Japan or Korea, China's production capacity was on par with our own, and they were actually able to provide enough of a given product to choke out domestic production, when this wasn't possible before.  A lot of people remember losing their jobs, and aren't too thrilled out it.",

They also put money into research, of course, but that wasn't what pushed Germany out of solar and it also wasnt production capabilities. Otherwise Germany also wouldnt be one of the biggest players in the car industry. But when China decides to pump billion after billion into their industry to massively undercut other countries to the point of selling modules at half the production price in other countries then that isnt a free market situation any longer. There is a reason why the EU has also put up a lot of tariffs on Chinese products in fields where it's know that Chinese companies can only sustain their price point because the Chinese government is paying for it.",

China didn't subsidize solar power because they wanted to undercut others, they did it because the 2008 financial crises dropped demand heavily for solar so the government stepped in to save the companies and their jobs. Germany didn't bother to do that for their own companies (like Solon, Q Cells), so when the economy recovered, guess who was around to fulfill the demand again? \n\nDon't blame China for Germany's stupidity in refusing to support the solar industry. \n\nhttps://chinafocus.ucsd.edu/2021/02/16/solar-energy-in-china-the-past-present-and-future/",

There are simply so many better options for EVs/hybrids now.\n\nThat said, Tesla absolutely revolutionized and mainstreamed EVs \u2014 in every way. Marketing, excitement, performance, style. I still have the first article I ever read about the  (1st gen) Roadster a new EV company called \"Tesla\" was coming out with. I was downright giddy that someone was FINALLY coming out with a modern, hot looking, high performance electric car. I told anyone who would listen about it, and how damned brilliant it was for this Musk guy to target the luxury, performance market. \n\nThen came the Model S. It looked and performed like no other family sedan on the market. It even broke the NHTSA crush testing machine on its way to scoring the highest safety rating ever handed out for a passenger car. When Musk announced that Tesla would make their patents open to the public \u2014 free to use \u2014 in 2014, it was absolutely revolutionary for the industry.\n\nAll this makes the company's decline \u2014 which, IMHO falls squarely on Musk \u2014 nearly as historic as its rise.",

A widespread roll out of the necessary charging stations to facilitate these rates, and the necessary infrastructure changes to, in turn, facilitate these the charging stations, will take a looong while still. At least in the EU and US.\n\nHell, here in Europe we are seeing current brand new fast charging stations with rates up to 300 kWh struggling to actually deliver up to 300 kWh when multiple cars are pulled up to a station and charging at the same time, simply bc the grid cannot deliver the required power. Especially next to high ways during holiday periods. And thats often after changes to the grid have already been made to facilitate the charging station...\n\nI'm all for what BYD has developed here. But unfortunately we have to be realistic. it'll be several years before we can take advantage of this tech en-masse.\n\nSee demo of the charging process with charging power over time;  \n[The EV That Charges as Fast as a Gas Fill-Up! 1,000 kW BYD Megawatt Flash Charge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOL2XSaYB8c)",
