Let them remain in the wastelands they have created, rather than enjoying refuge in the societies they neither built nor deserve.

The money needs to go to non-established players and let them innovate/decimate ATT/Verizon/so forth. The problem is, these company have lawmakers in their pockets, and the money is squandered.",

What we don't know, besides their internal financials, is whether or not they have been able to maintain service quality while growing their customer base. On the financial side, we don't know if their special arrangement with several different governments have essentially been subsidizing their consumer market. However, it's entirely possible that they have managed to drive down the costs of production and deployment to the point that they are at or near profitability, but as this is a musk company with all the important data about it hidden, I am inclined to believe it's all smoke and mirrors like pretty much every other enterprise he is involved in.

They ban internet up to the satellites to redistribute it down. So that terminal in Colorado has to send a signal to Starlink which then sends the signal back down to earth as a receiving station near your terminal. Then that signal is sent through the same connections in land that regular internet uses, then it's banned back up to Starlink near your location to be sent back down to you yet again. You're adding additional transmission distance to the signal",

That's kind of on purpose though, since it's more meant to compete with small business and rural/remote.  You can suddenly compete with anyone, anywhere, and you don't have to negotiate access to other networks too.  \n\nFor example, if you are a tiny business in a business district, business internet *starts* at like $150 for basic speeds.  They gouge the fuck out of you.  \n\nIt's also notable that Starlink exists to fill capacity for SpaceX launches when they have more capacity than they need.  You simply fill in test launches, etc with Starlink satellites, and they pay off the launch with some bonus.  I think the long-term goal would be that Starship would end up launching satellites for maintenance, and this would end up reducing their launch costs to single digit percent of what it currently costs.  Though, I doubt this will reflect much into the final price, it would allow them to handily tackle ISPs.\n\n**TL;DR:** In the US, ISPs gouge you if you can, to the extent that it actually is a reasonable thing to launch low earth orbit satellites in mass quantity as alternatives.",

That's not an issue for privately-held SpaceX, and so Elon assuming control of the government's purse in the shadows completes a loop of potential graft in which private SpaceX is on the receiving end, also outside of public scrutiny.\n\nI think Elon also is tuned in enough to realize SpaceX has much higher chances of obtaining a kind of monopoly over launches and satellites and space travel, and higher prices over time to reflect that -- especially with being so chummy with Trump and access to the payments system and all government contracts, which his competitors certainly do not have.\n\nTesla on the other hand is emerging as just another electric car company, and with rivals catching up fast I think Elon might realize his baby cannot for much longer demand such insane stock valuation as a wider, more sophisticated \"tech\" company. He accomplished that valuation promising many things -- self-driving, robo taxis -- that have failed to materialize.\n\nSo while Tesla is the largest part of his wealth currently, I think he knows its days are numbered to maintain that market share, and is pushing his chips all in on profiting from his government access and SpaceX.",

(Keep in mind this was started and built as a 10 year program). BEAD isn't perfect, but it is vastly more comprehensive long term than what Trump is suggesting.\n\nThere is a good article that concentrates on Virginia which talks about the problems BEAD has had over its first 4'ish years.

Two things can be true.\n\nLet\u2019s ignore politics for a moment. The rollout of broadband and fiber to rural areas has been an absolute boondoggle to the point it is a punchline. At this point, the Starlink technology is superior to hardwired when factoring in the complications of running fiber to remote areas - and I say this as someone who runs Ethernet whenever possible over WiFi (not a perfect analogy, but close enough for this point) and recognize that there are situations when some sort of WiFi solution is preferable when optimizing across more dimensions than just max throughput and availability. The satellite internet technology has come a long ways to the point the average consumer may never notice a difference between fiber and starlink in their daily lives, and starlink is a fraction of the cost.\n\nNow let\u2019s add back in politics. Yeah, it looks bad for Trump to be giving contracts to the guy who funded his campaign and is stumping for him every day. It sure as hell seems like a kickback and pay-to-play. *hopefully* there is a very clear process we can follow to show that musk wasn\u2019t simply given the contract and had to bid in a free and fair competition for the government deal - which is complicated by the fact that nobody else can provide what starlink does at the same quality and scale \u2026 so of course they would win the bid on its merits too.",

I do think that there is a lot of benefit to the service and we have only scratched the surface of it. I can't wait to see it integrated into smart phones, and you could have connectivity just about anywhere on earth. \n\nThe one thing I really want to see though, is whichever method of high speed internet is government funded, needs to be classified as a utility and have their service regulated.

Anyone that believes it still in place has let themselves be fooled.\n\nFor example here in Florida there\u2019s a law that says that you cannot go after a doctor for medical negligence resulting in death if the patient was over the age of 25, not married, and did not have kids under the age of 25.  The reason why? They said if they allowed that to happen that malpractice insurance would be too high and no doctors would want to work here in Florida.\n\nPeople have tried getting the laws to change, including my mom and my grandma who went on a big tirade after a doctor\u2018s negligence resulted in the death of my uncle. They were able to get bills submitted but they\u2019ve always killed the bills and not let them go. One of the politicians who is a chair of one of the committees said that as long as he\u2019s there he will never let it pass. \n\nIn the way it works is he is able to choose what bills get called to the floor to be voted on. So what happens is anything that he doesn\u2019t like he never lets get presented to the committee and then it dies without ever getting a chance to be voted on .\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just my mom and Grandma that have fought for these changes but there are other groups that have tried many times before but still can\u2019t get it done. And these groups are continually pushing and trying to pass it but it\u2019s not happening. Here\u2019s an article from this year. https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/state/families-hopeful-florida-lawmakers-will-let-free-kill-law-die-this-session\n\nIf it was a democracy it would be able to go up for voting and the people would have a chance. But instead it\u2019s the people in power who make it happen. \n\nAnd as much as we want to say that the people get there to be empower through the Democratic process really calls a lot into questions as well. We have absolutely no transparency in the voting process. Except for them knowing that someone signed in and submitted a vote there\u2019s nothing else. I could take your vote and shred it and replace it and nobody would ever know. Even in a recount they don\u2019t have access to a lot of this. All they can do is check to see how many people showed up at that polling location compared to how many votes are tallied in which ways those votes were cast. But there would be no way of knowing if it\u2019s actually the vote that you submitted",

And not do a \"No fiber, Starlink instead\", it'd need to be a new investment into Starlink in addition to the fiber investment. \n\nRight now, it's an obvious payout, bribe, protection money, gang payoff, whatever. And, with all the excuses I've heard time and time again in support of Musk and these dealings, not a single one has any merit that Musk is not doing all this for his own interests and Trump is paying him off. Conspiracy theories aside, it's all out in the open for those deals and favoring Musk (including the Tesla Car Lot at the White House). \n\nThe program is being ruined. Many of those programs have really helped rural America with solid, high speed, long term internet services. Many of them being more local independent ISP's, but a lot with much larger ISP's.  This is beneficial to making America great again, and benefits education (which isn't just for liberals as some keep screaming, it's for those home schoolers, curious kids and adults, etc., but it also teaches facts and gives them the real news... along with the BS news and weird nonsense... We've all seen those places! But, better than \"Mamma said....\").",
