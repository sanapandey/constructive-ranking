            "body": "Hey there!\n\nI work from home a lot now and I\u2019m trying to put together a setup where I can easily switch between the company laptop and my gaming PC. I\u2019m looking for a KVM switch that fits the purpose (Level1Techs being the top reference right now), but I\u2019m not quite sure which one is the one. Here\u2019s my setup:\n\nDesktop:\n- 1x 21:9 DisplayPort monitor \u2014 3440x1440@100Hz\n- 2x 16:9 DisplayPort monitors \u2014 1920x1080@60Hz\n\nLaptop:\n- 1x HDMI out\n- 2x USB-C out\n\nThe main problem is that the laptop is either HDMI or USB-C. This means that I\u2019d need a KVM switch where I can connect the laptop with a USB-C cable and the KVM switch would output to 3x DP but that still has 3x DP inputs for the desktop. Level1Techs has the [Combo USB-C Power Delivery & DisplayPort 1.4 KVM](https://www.store.level1techs.com/products/p/combo-displayport-usb-c-kvm-with-usb-power-delivery), which is close, but lacks the third DP input for the desktop.\n\nThe other requirement is that I still want to be able to get 100fps at 3440x1440, potentially more when I upgrade my monitor down the line.\n\nIs there any recommended switch that can do what I need?\n\nThanks!",

However may want to run some services like immich + jellyfin for external users. Also typically may have a miniPC running torrents while i'm browsing on my macbook wirelessly\n\nI'd ideally like to buy only 1 device and not 2 (router + switch) just to keep clutter down.\n\nWhat's the cheapest router that would:\n\n1. Provide security/IDS from internet up to 1Gbps\n2. Provide full 2.5Gbps LAN speeds between NAS, miniPC, etc that are local. Also flexible if these are SFP or faster ports if they can negotiate down to 2.5Gbps\n3. Good SQM to keep data flowing to my macbook prioritized vs torrent or other traffic flowing into miniPCs\n\nI saw the Ubiquiti Max at $200 which was kind of more than I wanted to spend. However I noticed that IDS was limited to 1.5Gbps. Woudl that slow down my internal 2.5gbps LAN transfers as well? Or fine since incoming internet is only 1Gbps?\n\nI do realize I could buy a separate router + switch, but pricing seems like it would end up about the same and I'd just have more clutter and devices. Fine with buying used.",

There were a couple things I did get running in Docker a couple years ago, when I was just fooling around with it and barely knew what I was doing. I've also only kept up on maintenance to a minimal degree. I'm on top of everything at my IT job, but like the saying goes, the shoemaker's kids go barefoot. \n\nSo far on a test Pi I've got Nginx Proxy Manager, Portainer, PiHole, Unbound, Wireguard, and Uptime Kuma up and running. I have Gitea running but need to reconfigure it to match what I had set up on bare metal and test migrating my repos. I have a wiki spun up that's going to store all my network documentation, because figuring out what past me did or where to find a config file when I need to quickly edit it to fix something has not been fun. Tonight's project was getting Kea DHCP Server figured out, which was a big success in that it works and that I managed to test it without it handing out addresses to anything it shouldn't have.\n\nI still have a lot of work ahead before I'm ready to rebuild all of this for real on a mini PC running Debian and move over to it, and it will likely coincide with a much-needed re-IPing of all my network devices that is probably not going to be enjoyable. But I've come a long way in the last few weeks, I'm feeling good about myself right now, and just needed to [strut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_Lo2kSaFNQ) a little.

Well, I lied. \n\nI currently have an EX3400-48P for my homelab core, and an EX3400-24P for WAN aggregation. I was considering replacing both of these with a single C9300-24UX-A, with the 8x10G SFP+ module. \n\nSo my main concern, is that this switch would handle all of my internal traffic, and also be at my WAN edge. I don't care about this with the 3400, because the only IP on the system is on the MGT port, which I have configured to hardware lock all of that traffic solely to the MGT port, which is uplinked to my core. But with the 9300 it's not like I have another switch to uplink to (and it is not just going to solely handle WAN traffic), the IP would need to be on an SVI or RVI or whatever Cisco calls it. \n\nI was assuming I would do an identical setup, as I have on the 3400, where the two ports up to my two Palos are on VLAN 201, as well as the uplink out to the WAN. Then the actual internal uplinks up to the Palo are trunked for all VLANs except 201?\n\nOr would it be better to just replace my core and keep the WAN 3400 in place?",

So if I spin up a new node all the DNS gets setup automatically for me. The main problem ended up being the lack of automated DNS challenges for let's encrypt. So I'd to have manually update the txt records anyways defeating the entire point.\n\nFor now I'm just manually adding A records on cloudflare so I can use automated DNS challenges like you suggested. It's easy enough to add and delete those as I spin up nodes.",

I have a couple of questions.  \nThey are quite generic, not sure they deserve a dedicated topic: most likely they have been already answered but I'm horrible at searching stuff.\n\n# Context: \n\nI realized I did end up accumulating half a dozen or so of disks, between mechanical and SSDs. Completely different sizes and all.  \n\nI thus though \"Why, I should use them for a NAS\" which evolved into \"why not a full-on self-hosted multi-services system? I already have my own domain!\"\n\nCurrently plan is to self-host(behind a VPN):\n\n* a PiHole instance   \n* some sort of backup solution?\n* a RSS server\n* something to share\\access files and directories between devices\n* IMAP\\SMTP mail server(s)\n* Newsgroup server?\n* IRC server\n* some ActivityPub instance(mastodon or pleroma?) meant for single-user use\n* probably a Matrix\\Element server  \n* most likely a bittorrent client\n  *     perhaps a emule one as well?\n* a Nextcloud instance(might or might not replace other services), \n* the VPN manager, I guess   \n* probably other stuff to see what I use\\can use\\just to play with it.\n\n# So the questions:\n\n**What would be the cheapest way to do this?**   \n\nI was thinking either buy a pre-made NAS, possibly with enough disk bays, or use a Raspberry Pi4 or 5, though I'm not 100% a raspberry would keep up with all this stuff which, I guess, would end up running on docker.   \nI think the main issue right now is how to manage the disks: a separated DAS perhaps?  \n\nit's kind-of a long-term plan, to be as self-hosting as possible.   \nSo I think accessing the disks might be the first thing to do, I can then attach them to whatever system I might whip out later... and to my current system for now.",
