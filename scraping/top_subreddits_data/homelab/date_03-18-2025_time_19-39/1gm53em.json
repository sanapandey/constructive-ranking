NAS2 serves as my testing box, on which I test the beta versions of apps as well as the OS.\n\nI plan on upgrading the UAP AC Pro to a U7 and replacing the N1548P with a Pro Max 24 PoE.  Eventually the Sophos is getting replaced but haven't decided on what I'm going to replace it with.\n\nEventually, I'm going to upgrade the drives in NAS1 so that they are all the same capacity.  Currently, 1 vdev has 4 12TB drives while the second has 8TB drives and the third has 4TB drives.  I'm going to put all 12TB drives in.",

Seems it\u2019s documented differently everywhere, and it all assumes a base level of knowledge I clearly don\u2019t have. \n\nThat and I\u2019m missing a fully supported terraform provider, so things are taking a lot of \u201ctry this.  Did it work? Ok try this\u201d iteration. \n\nWhy Broadcom?  Why did you ruin the nice bubble I had going?",

            "body": "My Ubiquiti Dream Router keeps dropping connection to ISP, so Ubiquiti is having me send it in via their RMA process.  Presumably for replacement.\n\nIn the meantime, I can either\n\n1) buy and set up a different brand router;\n\n2) go back to using the ISP's DSL modem/router (Zyxel C3000Z) as my router.\n\nSo that's super fun.\n\nMaybe I chose the wrong router in the first place.\n\nWhat would you do, assuming the cost of a new router is no object?\n\nI almost bought a MikroTik or GLI.net router instead of the UDR, so maybe it's time for a second look at that.\n\nNot real confident in Ubiquiti at this time.  Sure, I get a (probably remanufactured) replacement unit, but maybe it does the same thing again in a few months.  Might be time to cut my losses and move on.\n\nupdate: Having received zero responses, I removed the UDR from my network and went back to using the telco device as router, temporarily (ugh).  It's a big step back, particularly in not being able to serve both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz devices under one SSID.  UDR is shipping off for repairs.\n\nI might get something else in the meantime.  Aside from the lack of device reliability, there were some other things I didn't like that much about the Ubiquiti \"experience.\"\n\nupdate2: Shipped the old router off for RMA on Monday (2 Dec).  They are sending out the replacement unit today (6 Dec).  not bad for turnaround!",

Planning to replace with a Truenas built on an R720 I have, once I pick up the drives and a 10gbe sfp+ nic for it.\n\n\nVirtualization:\n\n* vCenter 8 with a single esxi; old lab being turned down, only really used for testing at this point\n\n* VergeOS 2 node HCI cluster /r/vergeio - KVM/QEMU hypervisor with vSAN.  Runs about 20-30 VMs usually at any given time for \nAD, home assistant, 3d printing, AMP servers, etc. Home Prod. Possibly destructive testing inside tenants.\n\n\nHypervisors:\n\n* 2x Minisforum MS-01 13900H systems, 96GB RAM/ea, 4TB nvme drive/ea in vSAN. 10gb DACs between hosts for VergeOS HA core fabric, 2x2.5gbe/host to clients today. Eventually will likely give up the HA for more usable client bw and take one of the 10gb connections to a switch.\n\n* 1xDell R720xd - 8x512GB SATA SSDs, 2x Xeon E5-2680 v2, 384GB RAM, 12x1Gbe NICs LAGGd to the Brocade.\n\n\nI was able to get an NFR license for VergeOS earlier this year; it's a BYOHardware HCI platform. Compute, vSAN, networking, tenantization.  Full VDC and even includes a VMWare backup function for import/migration.  Been really digging it.  UI is a bit 'eh', but it's plenty serviceable and extremely configurable.  For a home lab, particularly, the tenantization is wonderful for mocking up multiple networks and scenarios quickly. There's good API functionality; you can actually completely automate system control and could write your own UI or something I believe with the amount of access you have.\n\nVMWare right now I think I have about in it's minimal state.  I'm going to keep it around in some form since VMWare is still very much the done thing, but a lot of places are moving away from it, so getting experience on something else felt prudent and specifically learning to move things from VMware to KVM/QEMU *more* open things.  Verge isn't OSS, but from what I've seen it's nearly entirely based on it, other than the vSAN component I think.\n\nI'll probably turn the VMware hardware down a little more at some point, or maybe just use idrac to bring it up when I need to do something particularly with vmware.  We'll see. Considered using esx for the truenas I'm building, rather than install bare metal, so I could have a minimal vmware there, but serving a good purpose and not just idling.",

Will be adding a 3060 and hoping to aim for a voice home assistant. From what I'm seeing, having a dedicated box for AI is common, but would adding to a current system cause problems? **rambling over for now**  \nJust realized this is a November 2024 thread, so \"Hello future me!\"",
