    "selftext": "\n\nSo after acquiring a hp prodesk g3 800 i7 and a hp microserver gen10 plus a month or so ago.... I've now got all this.... \ud83d\ude02  It's this groups fault I swear. \n\nSmall network cabinet from Facebook market place  \u00a335\nThis came with a free hp2910al-24g and shed load of cat6a patch cables. (yes they could be shorter and when I'm. Confident it all works as it should I'll. Make some shorter ones. \nAnd an extreme networks 210 poe+ switch .....again included. (\u00a335 for two switches and a cabinet!) \n\nCat6 patch panel. \n\nI got a nice 3d print rack mount for the elitedesk \n\nNow that I have poe+ I've bought 2x u6 pros (these will be relocated one upstairs and one downstairs) but I have a stone house to need to channel out for cat6 runs. \nI have hidden this under the stairs.... It was there a week before the wife noticed.\nI'm currently waiting on some IP Cameras to replace my Google nest cams and doorbell and I'll finally be google free...... Typed on my pixel 8 pro. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nSo what am I running.. \n\nProxmox on both\n\nOpnsense as my router and firewall with unbound \nUnifi Controller for the APs\nPihole as a dns\nTrueNAS as storage (well it's installed and running I've not messed with it yet) \nHome Assistant (migrated from home assistant green)\nPlex \n\nI'm not using the hp2910al-24g procurve yet. But it does have 2 10g sfp ports.... Whixh I would run to my workstation and truenas server I guess.\n\nI'm a Baker by trade and I'm basically self taught in this area not done too badly so far, made my own cables and everything! \n\nNext plan is to teach myself VLANs as my wife's work got hacked by Medusa and she works from home so I don't want to loose anything. \n\nAnyway.... \n\nCheers all great group for inspiration. \nTWN\n\n",
