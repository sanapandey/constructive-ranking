The only thing a HomeKit hub does is allow you to use HomeKit when you're not on your home network.\n\n  \nHomeKit is still a somewhat limited ecosystem. However, it does support Matter and Thread so the options will only continue to grow. Additionally, you can use Home Assistant or HomeBridge to add devices to HomeKit that lack Matter and/or official support.\n\n  \nFor me, HomeKit (with Home Assistant) is a no-brainer. My partner and I both use iPhones and Mac computers so being able to control everything in the house from a built-in app that is easy to use just makes sense.\n\n  \nIf your household isn't fully committed to the Apple ecosystem, I'd go with something else.\n\n  \nAs an aside, I'd generally recommend against connecting a bunch of IOT devices to your WiFi. Privacy is a big component here but you can mostly get around this with VLANs and some FW rules that don't allow the devices to talk to the internet. For me, it's about the noise. I have a lot of IOT devices and many of them are poorly coded to just scream into the void that is your wireless network even when you're not using them. The more of those you have, the less airwaves you have for actual network traffic.\n\n  \nGoing with something like Home Assistant allows you to use a Zigbee/ZWave/Thread network for your IOT devices to communicate with each other. Everything connects back to Home Assistant which does get a connection to your network. Then you talk to Home Assistant over the network and it relays those commands to each device through their own network. Much less chatter and HA basically acts as a router between your network and your IOT devices.",
