    "selftext": "It was quite a challenge since I was so stuck on building it in the LianLi A3-Matx case even though it was super impractical compared to other options out there. Eventually down the line when I can afford more drives I believe I\u2019ll be able to fit 8 drives in here, either that or I\u2019ll move all the parts to a different  more NAS friendly case with swappable drive bays and do a gaming build in this one down, but this will work for now.",
