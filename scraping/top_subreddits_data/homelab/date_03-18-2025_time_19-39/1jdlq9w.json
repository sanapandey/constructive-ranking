These are monetary extraction machines driven by board meetings, shareholder interests, and stock price. We are in a permanent state of war between corporations and end users. Corpos try to milk more money, end users get fed up and find ways around the paywalls. We still get what we want or need, and the corporation that wants to act all exploitative just suffers and starves til it collapses. This is the nature of the beast. This is the competition that supporters of capitalism always seem to have an issue with. You try to paywalls something excessively, we take it by force. I just pirated Starfield because I'm not spending $70 on a subpar starship simulator. I love starship simulators, and I love space games, but even the current sale price of $40ish is too much for me. The devs at Bethesda are still getting paid. Bethesda isn't sinking. They're a huge corporate game development studio with several subsidiaries and shit.

In <current year>?\n\n> for the cost of 1 500GB drive\n\n[*] Assuming you've got ten 2.5\" slots for free on a backplane somewhere, just waiting on an existing configured and running server with no plans for other usage.\n\n> low power, low heat, quiet storage\n\nYou can't be talking about cheap ex-enterprise server hardware, because that's almost certainly either not low power, or not quiet, or not low heat. So you probably mean some kind of consumer chassis with hot swap bays, or we're talking about generic cases with 5.25\" bays to slot in at least two 2.5\" drive bay adapters. Which need cabling! And probably need a HBA too, because your mainboard probably doesn't even have 10 native SATA lanes, and you probably didn't pay through the nose to upsize your first HBA with enough spare room to just plug ten more drives in at will.\n\nNo - more than likely, to backplane these, you'll be buying the backplane and some other hardware. To be honest - that's more expensive, in time and effort and money, than these drives are worth. You're probably talking about spending more on the hardware surrounding them than all ten drives would cost at full price.\n\nAnd you won't get 5TB usable out of it. Not unless you're gonna stripe it and risk a single drive bringing all that data down. We're talking 1-2 drives of parity at minimum for this block of drives, or maybe MergerFS with its overhead and inefficiencies. Even if you got the full 5TB... That is simply not a lot of storage. Not for all the adjacent components and effort involved actually making them useful.\n\nFree is free, and they're not bad. If you've got a system spare and only need a little bit of redundant storage, throw these in and go to town. But if you actually want to get serious about your storage - these are not ideal. They're not BAD - they're just not ideal.",

Lmao.\n\nNo kidding it requires only 2 power cables. 4x SATA power connector cables exist, that's 8 drives in two cables even if you don't have a backplane? You still needed to wire up data. You still need to build the system in the first place. You need that 8x backplane chassis and the hardware around it. And you still don't get to use all ten of the drives, duh. You're making my point for me - not even you can make use of ten drives for free. How much money does this system cost? Probably the same as a 4TB m.2 drive that's way faster and you'll actually have a free port for on an existing system to make full use of. Then you can put some *actually* large storage in your dedicated mini ITX NAS.\n\nI'll say it one more time because it doesn't seem to be sinking in. I keep trying to explain it and you keep making character attacks because you feel like your intelligence is being insulted, I guess. Ten free drives are not bad. But they're not a free lunch, either. You don't get to automatically benefit from them without further investment and effort. And further investment in running these drives in RAID probably isn't the most cost effective way to increase your storage, except for the fun of it. That's a fact. You can keep attacking me if you like, but unless you can show that the hardware required to actually connect ten drives to the average user's setup is actually free or close to it somehow, you don't have a leg to stand on with this strange aggression.",
