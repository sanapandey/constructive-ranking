SO, because hate crime laws' punishment is not severe enough to fit the crime, the record will not reflect that a Black, Transgender man was lured by a woman feigning romantic interest in order to convince Sam to come to New York so SEVEN PEOPLE could rape and torture him, and then force small children to torture them, as well. \n\nThere have been charges butte investigation is on-going and no trial information will be ready until it's complete, so, no.

Moses recognized one of the men who took Till and decided to accuse him and ensure there was a trial. This was incredibly rare in the Jim Crow south, insanely dangerous for Moses, and the outcome of any trial was predetermined by the impossibility of a guilty verdict being given by an all white jury. But he did, and the trial was covered in the news all over the country. In the most hostile and appallingly racist atmosphere imaginable, surrounded by the most powerful and hateful men in the town, when asked to identify his nephews killer he stood up, leaned across the witness stand, pointed at the man and said \u201cThar he\u201d. The man was of course found not guilty, but thankfully Moses and his wife made it safely out of the south after the trial.\n\nEdit: I bungled the names here, I learned about Moses through Robert Caro\u2019s LBJ biographies. Robert Caro also wrote the biography or Robert Moses, who was ironically an awful racist. As for what he said specifically, Caro says it\u2019s \u201cThar he\u201d so take it up with him.",

To them, to acknowledge is to admit responsibility entirely. As an autistic person these are people you cannot make a simple environmental or behavioral observation around without them automatically and immediately internalizing it as a highly offensive, permanently damning, and personalized act of character violence.\u00a0\n\n\nI study development and the majority of the problematic people we are expecting compassion out of are very clearly stuck at an elementary school level in foundational areas like emotional and intellectual ability. If you don't take Critical Thinking 101, you can't even enter 102, much less be anything other than intimidated by 401.\u00a0These folks haven't even figured out how to be self-aware or properly apologize... They're baby-gripping onto fear and therefore also hatred like it's their mothers' cable knit, melting down when their stunted perceptions of their needs for comfort and safety are not sufficiently satisfied.\n\n\nPrompting people this underdeveloped and fear-steeped to ground into reality quickly and willingly is not just difficult but dangerous and inefficient. Even the most horrifically literate and organized racists don't truly understand race or racism... If they did, they wouldn't be racist-- Unless they're severely disordered in very specific areas, some of which have yet to be researched at all. This is why rehabilitative/restorative justice and anti-sanist/abolitionist-reformed psychiatry are so incredibly important to our revolution.\u00a0",

Here is a quote where Critical Race Theory explicitly endorses segregation:\n\n>8 Cultural nationalism/separatism. An emerging strain within CRT holds that people of color can best promote their interest through separation from the American mainstream. Some believe that preserving diversity and separateness will benefit all, not just groups of color. We include here, as well, articles encouraging black nationalism, power, or insurrection. (Theme number 8).\n\nRacial separatism is identified as one of ten major themes of Critical Race Theory in an early bibliography that was codifying CRT with a list of works in the field:\n\n>To be included in the Bibliography, a work needed to address one or more themes we deemed to fall within Critical Race thought. These themes, along with the numbering scheme we have employed, follow:\n\nDelgado, Richard, and Jean Stefancic. \"Critical race theory: An annotated bibliography.\" Virginia Law Review (1993): 461-516.\n\nOne of the cited works under theme 8 analogizes contemporary CRT and Malcolm X's endorsement of Black and White segregation:\n\n>But Malcolm X did identify the basic racial compromise that the incorporation of the \"the civil rights struggle\" into mainstream American culture would eventually embody: Along with the suppression of white racism that was the widely celebrated aim of civil rights reform, the dominant conception of racial justice was framed to require that black nationalists be equated with white supremacists, and that race consciousness on the part of either whites or blacks be marginalized as beyond the good sense of enlightened American culture. When a new generation of scholars embraced race consciousness as a fundamental prism through which to organize social analysis in the latter half of the 1980s, a negative reaction from mainstream academics was predictable. That is, Randall Kennedy's criticism of the work of critical race theorists for being based on racial \"stereotypes\" and \"status-based\" standards is coherent from the vantage point of the reigning interpretation of racial justice. And it was the exclusionary borders of this ideology that Malcolm X identified.\n\nPeller, Gary. \"Race consciousness.\" Duke LJ (1990): 758.\n\nThis is current and mentioned in the most prominent textbook on CRT:\n\n>The two friends illustrate twin poles in the way minorities of color can represent and position themselves. The nationalist, or separatist, position illustrated by Jamal holds that people of color should embrace their culture and origins. Jamal, who by choice lives in an upscale black neighborhood and sends his children to local schools, could easily fit into mainstream life. But he feels more comfortable working and living in black milieux and considers that he has a duty to contribute to the minority community. Accordingly, he does as much business as possible with other blacks. The last time he and his family moved, for example, he made several phone calls until he found a black-owned moving company. He donates money to several African American philanthropies and colleges. And, of course, his work in the music industry allows him the opportunity to boost the careers of black musicians, which he does.\n\nDelgado, Richard and Jean Stefancic Critical Race Theory: An Introduction. New York. New York University Press, 2001.\n\nDelgado and Stefancic (2001)'s fourth edition was printed in 2023 and is currently the top result for the Google search 'Critical Race Theory textbook':\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=critical+race+theory+textbook\n\nOne more from the recognized founder of CRT, who specialized in education policy:\n\n>\"From the standpoint of education, we would have been better served had the court in Brown rejected the petitioners' arguments to overrule Plessy v. Ferguson,\" Bell said, referring to the 1896 Supreme Court ruling that enforced a \"separate but equal\" standard for blacks and whites.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20110802202458/https://news.stanford.edu/news/2004/april21/brownbell-421.html",
