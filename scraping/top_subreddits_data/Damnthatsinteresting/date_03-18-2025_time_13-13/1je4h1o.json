And unfortunately, the detection threshold for a test to be considered positive has been set to stupidly low levels.\n\n\nIf the \"expensive\" tests made any difference, it's probably just because it took a while to get them, and in that time their bodies eliminated the small amount of opiates, returning down to levels below that threshold.",

I don\u2019t have chronic pain, I take it purely recreationally.
