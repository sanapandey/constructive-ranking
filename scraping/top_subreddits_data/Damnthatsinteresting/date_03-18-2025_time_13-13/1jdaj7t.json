But we do have a whole solid concrete rockpool for example, and I know at least one of the 3 main tanks has concrete rocks in, as it had to be soaked for a long time to leech out any chemicals before animals could be added. It may be as you say that it was a concrete cover on a lighter cheaper material though.",

            "body": "Addressing the allegations:\n\n[From](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/trecms/pdf/AD0634074.pdf), summary:\n>Throughout the technical literature, there are many claims (some supported\nby experimental data) that shotcrete is stronger, denser, and more resistant to deterioration than conventional concrete. Whether or not shotcrete always possesses these attributes is a moot question, since its quality depends mainly on the nozzleman and the inspector. Premixed-dry shotcrete has been in use since 1910 and often is referred to as Gunite. Premixed-wet shotcrete is a recent development, having been in use since\n1955. Aggregate as large as 0.750 inch was first used in 1960. The use of premixed-wet shotcrete offers the following advantages over premixed-dry shotcrete: (1) aggregates may be delivered to the mixer in any moist condition; (2) constant water-cement ratio is assured after correcting for the moisture content of aggregate; (3) the constituents are thoroughly mixed before transmission to the gun; and (4) the nozzleman need be concerned only with properly gunning the\nshotcrete into place. Though the published technical data concerning physical properties of hardened shotcrete indicate a wide range in values, good hardened plain shotcrete is generally quite similar to hardened plain concrete or mortar having the same mix proportions and that has been fully compacted. The water-cement ratio (by weight) of shotcrete usually ranges from 0.31 to 0.53, which is equivalent, respectively, to 3.5 and 6.0 gallons per bag. The average shrinkage of shotcrete varies between 0.05 and 0.15%, whereas that for conventional concrete or mortar ranges between 0.05 and 0.08%. The ultimate creep of premixed-wet fine shotcrete is about seven times that of premixed-dry fine shotcrete, if the sustained compressive stress is 1,000 psi beginning at age 28 days. The average durability (i.e., resistance to failure caused by cyclic alternate freezing and thawing) of premixed-dry shotcrete (fine or coarse) is about twice that of premixed-wet shotcrete (fine or coarse). At age 28 days, compressive and flexural strengths may be as high as 13,000 and 1,400 psi respectively, tensile strength may be nearly 600 psi, and modulus of elasticity may range between 2.5 x 10^ and 6.5 x 106 psi, all depending on shotcrete mix design and method of production. The strength of shotcrete is a function of the velocity at which ejection occurs, all other factors being equal. Shotcrete made with high-silica cement cracks less and creeps more than if it is made with either\nnormal or high-early-strength portland cement. The average unit weight of hardened shotcrete made with common aggregate lies between 140 and 145 pcf. If shotcrete is correctly gunned into place, its bond to steel is greater than that of conventionally placed mortar or concrete. The coefficient of thermal expansion of premixed-dry\nfine shotcrete, incorporating common aggregate, is about the same as that of conventional concrete or mortar, lying between 5 x 10\"6 and 7 x 10\"6 in./in. per degree F. The average swellage, due to moisture gain, of premixed-dry fine shotcrete at age 1 week is about 2 x 10-4 \u00a1n./in. The abrasion resistance of hardened premixed-dry fine shotcrete is greater than that of hardened conventional concrete or mortar at comparable water-cement ratios. The permeability of hardened shotcrete appears to be of the same order of magnitude as that of fully compacted and properly cured conventional concrete.",
