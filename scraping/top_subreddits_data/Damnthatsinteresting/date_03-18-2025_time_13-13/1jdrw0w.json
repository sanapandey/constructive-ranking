The pawn shop let us talk them down to about 80 bucks but for some peculiar reason insisted that we took four or five drills with us. A couple Ryobi and a DeWalt and I forget what else. None of them had batteries, all of them had been sitting there for months as evidenced by the price tags showing changes over time. I was too confused by the rationale to understand exactly why they had to be part of the deal, but we were all pretty amused when we left with five screw guns and a bike for just a little tiny bit of our budget.....",

Her clothing is not chaste, but is fairly modest and unadorned; she is a modern woman though likely someone of limited means. The nun looks taken aback, as if the woman is defying her in some way, while the statue (or painting) of Mary looks at her almost disapprovingly. The contrast between the vibrant colour and bright light of the young woman against the stark, more dim lighting and dark clothing of the nun could signify the idea of unfair religious practices towards the poor. The young woman is also physically above the nun, looking down on her. \n\nThis is just what I have gathered from seeing the painting. I\u2019d be interested to hear who it was painted by and what they were trying to convey",
