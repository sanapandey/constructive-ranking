It's good, but it contains trade-offs vs. other strong designs.\n\nEg. A circle works quite well because it creates easily recognizable shapes like a triangle, pentagon and hexagon that are completely distinct (and remain so even if a pip is damaged or unreadable)\n\nA spiral gets visually larger as it goes, which optimizes for quickly reading which is the larger number.\n\nThe current/popular pattern is potentially harder to read in cases where the pips are worn out or lighting is poor, since eg. 4, 5, and 6 share pips in the exact same places, as do 2 & 3. Which isn't to say it's bad, just that it has its own issues and is just \"differently good\".\n\nDesign always includes trade-offs like this, which is why it's interesting that this design hasn't changed.\n\nETA: If I were to pick the thing the current design wins at, it's actually ease of hand manufacturing. You can consistently lay out the points with a 3x3 grid that's easy to measure with a straight edge.\n\nMost of the other options would require more advanced math or measuring tools.",

Some manufacturers compensate for this with subtle adjustments to each side, but the fool-proof solution that Vegas dice employ is to fill in the holes with a paint whose density matches the density of the rest of the material.",
