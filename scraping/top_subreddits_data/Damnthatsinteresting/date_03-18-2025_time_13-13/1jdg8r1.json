I'm glad to live at a time where different forms of intelligence and communication are being recognized more widely across the animal Kingdom.\n\nI'd add that the implication that chimpanzees are somehow like more primitive versions of us, which the narrator hints at, isn't true at all. Evolution isn't directed, we're not at the \"top\" of some evolutionary hierarchy, and contemporaneous species like humans and chimpanzees are both equally evolved. They're just different because of different selection pressures and evolutionary histories.\n\nEdit: sigh. Downvotes. Why do I bother? Like WTF are you downvoting, basic concepts of evolutionary biology? Get some fucking perspective.\n\nEdit: Sorry for complaining in my edit above. I got downvoted immediately after my initial comment. I felt bad because I offered what I think is a reasonable science-based opinion. I know that is just Reddit, and I shouldn\u2019t be so sensitive. But that's just who I am. And to me it\u2019s not about the karma or any of that stuff. I am just bummed out with the way some people just dismiss each other without any thoughtfulness about it. Like if I'm being a dick in my reply, downvote away! But if something I said was wrong, then explain it... Anyway, I didn't mean to confuse folks, because now my original comment seems to be getting many up votes. I hope that clarifies things.

This provides our advanced civilization an opportunity to gain insight into the methods of how humans conduct their research and their 'human centric' beliefs of superiority. This limits their perspectives and so has made our ability to observe them as they 'observe us' easier. We have been able to do this thanks to the brave, ongoing efforts of other elite actors, such as the camera-ape observing the human researcher. I know this one as an old friend and he has assumed the identity of Hugh Mann from Witchita. He explained to that his 'human-sona' has an interest in automobiles, likes dogs, and spends perhaps too much money on Legos, which is only mildly better, but considerably cheaper, than table-top figurines. Yes, that will be on the test next week.\n\nUnfortunately, it has been deduced that their progress has hit a bit of a slow down due to various socio-political issues, which will, as we predict, have decades of lasting impact. However, if they achieve the appropriate level of development, they may prove capable of joining our people's various research and development divisions. Ah, that is the bell, students. Please enjoy your weekend and remember your humanity studies essay is due in two weeks and will count for at least half of your grade.\"",
