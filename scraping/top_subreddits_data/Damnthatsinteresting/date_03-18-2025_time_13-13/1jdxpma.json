Legacy is always the result of our actions, the echos of what we leave behind in the people who love us. \n\nI\u2019m not a legacy chaser either. It\u2019s folly, egotism in its purest, unrefined form. A desire to create rooted in a fear of death, a fear of existential erasure. The fear of an ego that hasn\u2019t seen the full picture. \n\nPeople like that fail to recognize that we live on, regardless of whether or not there is an afterlife. \n\nI feel like we are arguing, but not arguing, we\u2019re refining our thoughts. It\u2019s like we both have pieces to this big picture. \n\nIn a way, you are macro looking at the scope of it, I\u2019m focusing on the micro.\n\nWe\u2019re both not wrong, we\u2019re both not right.\n\nBut together- our thoughts complete. Even though they may read as paradox.\n\nYou\u2019re stronger than you think dude. Don\u2019t limit yourself because we\u2019re not egomaniacal kings or doctors that innovate.",

Gameplay is pretty good as well, instead of having designated quests you need to complete, you will have a breakpoint system where you just need to help around the region enough to progress the game.

He was opposite Terrance Howard (not too far removed from his Oscar win), James Earl Jones, and Phylicia Rashad. Giancarlo absolutely stole the show. Despite the other stars in the show, we specifically waited for Giancarlo to come out to tell him how much we enjoyed his performance. He stayed and chatted with our small group for about 20 minutes. I was thrilled when he unexpectedly showed up on BB. I still have a great picture of him from that night I have been hoping to get to him.",

Losing our faculties and joy in life. And, by that logic there are some people who choose to have the same EOL treatment at a younger age. Like that women recently who was approved to use a suicide booth at an early age (depression where treatments weren't helping, iirc).\n\nSo anyway, it is sad, but i think i reserve the most sadness for those who die needlessly. Eg easily treated depression, financial decisions like this, etc. Things where society could have helped and fixed the problem.",

It's just interesting that some of us experience so much chronic pain, that several root canals needed in a week are just another Tuesday.\n\nChronic pain or a rough childhood leave a mark. Actors who actually went through that kind of life probably have a lot more lived experiences where the feelings they're now portraying were at one point for them entirely genuine.\n\nA very wealth kid born two very wealthy and powerful people will have their own set of problems, but going hungry or going cold usually aren't it.\n\nSome of them can go a very long time with no real challenge or obstacle in life, such that a *minor* toothache can to them feel like the end of the world.\n\nIt's important to have empathy, because it doesn't matter that to you it's just a \"toothache\". To that human being, it's still suffering.\n\nThe remarkable (or tragic) thing about humans is that suffer enough and long enough, and survive it, then you can possibly just endure more than the average person.\n\nYou may also die a lot of younger, though.",

I learned about this when I was a software dev at a life insurance company back in the 80's.\n\ngoogle for \"life insurance suicide\".

Otherwise, you could start paying for life insurance when you were in your 20's, and then 50 or 60 years later (having made payments that entire time) you end up with an incurable and incredibly painful health issue, you commit suicide, and the insurance companies would tell your family essentially \"screw you, he committed suicide, so we're not paying out, we're just keeping the money.\"\n\nThe time can vary by state, but 2 years is the most common by far.  That legal system has decided that is long enough to keep people from signing up just so they can kill themselves and leave the money to their family, while protecting the people who buy the insurance from being take advantage of by the companies.",
