During the last glacial period, sea levels were significantly lower, exposing vast areas that became rich habitats for flora and fauna. As the climate warmed and glaciers melted, rising sea levels gradually inundated these landscapes, submerging forests and creating what is now the North Sea. Archaeological findings, such as preserved tree stumps and peat deposits, indicate that these forests existed approximately 6,000 years ago before being overtaken by the encroaching sea. \n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fens\n\nhttps://hakaimagazine.com/features/conjuring-the-lost-land-beneath-the-north-sea/",
