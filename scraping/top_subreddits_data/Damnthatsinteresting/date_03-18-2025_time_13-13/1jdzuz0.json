Fast forward about a century, and the government enacted a law where preserved body parts had to have the permission of the original owner, or family, for them to be destroyed. Because the doctors didn't care about anything like recording who they stole body parts from, it suddenly left a lot of medical institutes in this weird awkward position where they had buildings full of preserved body parts that they weren't allowed to get rid of.",

Children were much more independent back then and could take care of themselves at an early age. By the age of 6, children were already starting to learn to do housework as helpers. By the age of 12, they were already independent. He could go fishing with his peers. Not for fun, but for food. Preparations for the winter or food for the evening. Most likely, the child, if he had a body part cut out, was not from a rich family. What rich person would allow their child to be abused like that? He should be buried in a Christian way. Most likely, his parents were from disenfranchised peasants. I could be wrong, I am not a historian. Did he do something stupid? Yes. Typical teenage behavior, he is still a teenager, even though he works. He brought the fish to his mouth and showed that he was going to eat it, but it slipped out of his hands and tried to run away. Or he held it with his teeth, and the fish is slippery, it went further. The spines on the fins do not allow him to pull it back out. This requires surgery. I think even adults, if they were nearby, would hardly help.",
