Later they decided Palestine is the best place for colonization. In zionist congress of 1897 they called themselves \"colonists in Palestine\". They have migrated there with the goal of colonization when Palestine was occupied by the British. They have said Palestine was \"a land without people\". And they finally colonized parts of it. To this day, they still take more and more of Palestinian land. They still expell Palestinians from their land. And now they are on a genoicde phase. Why would you doubt they are colonizers? They were proud to be colonizers until the term started having a bad meaning in peoples mind.\n\nIn the last few months, they invaded more of Syrian land. And they have been inaving parts of Syria for decades and have built colonies on it. Why would you deny that Israel took parts of Syria?",

I told you that zionists in zionist congress 1897 called themselves \"colonists in Palestine\". Can you say that this is not true and if this is true that you will believe they are colonizers who chose to colonize Palestine in order to replace its people?\n\nI will not waste anymore time trying to teach you history and reality while you tell me provide proof again and again. Educate yourself and do not join the colonist genociders. This is not something any person should do. You don't even know Syria is being invaded even more by Israel? Try getting your information outside genocide media then.",
