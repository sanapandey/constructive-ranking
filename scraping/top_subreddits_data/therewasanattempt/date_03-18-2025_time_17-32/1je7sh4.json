As was said during the last Trump administration, there is little motivation to negotiate with the US when policies can rapidly flip a few years later. Unfortunately for those of us who are sensible, smart, and compassionate, the United States got exactly what it voted for. I see no regret from Republican voters, I see nothing but gloating by Republicans online, and even those who appear to have misgivings about how they voted (or didn't vote) if they lost their jobs, or if their partners were detained, or whatever, would very much vote for Trump or a Republican again if given the choice, so nothing has been learned.",

Un-isolating trade will take years if not decades.\n\nAnd moreover all the fascist and foreign plants will still be in their cushy jobs. See Louis DeJoy, that Biden couldn't legally remove.

I guess you are one of those who voted for him. \n\nJust some quick questions. Do you really think the tariffs on Canada makes any sense? I can imagine some fentanyl is flowing over the Mexican border, but over the  border with Canada that problem most be the other way around. You two has been good neighbors for ages. Why the tariffs?\n\nHow could it be a good strategy in the negotiations with Putin to show your card before hand and say what you are willing to accept and threaten to end the support of Ukraine and get in to a public argument with Zelenskyy?\n\nHow will the tariffs and trade war with Canada, Mexico, Europe and China help with the inflation?\n\nWhy would the US need control over Greenland when its under governance of Denmark that is a NATO ally to the US?",

Unfortunately the way of mass poultry farming in the states makes your system far more susceptible to bird flu. In Canada the same thing happens if an infected bird is found, the entire farm gets killed yeah it\u2019s sad but it\u2019s what happens and is the best way to stop the spread, except when that happens here it\u2019s a farm with (avg from google) 36,000 birds maybe maybe at most 100,000 birds on it which is again shitty but not devastating to the overall \u201ceconomy of eggs\u201d, versus in the states chicken farms more often than not have hundreds of thousands if not millions of laying hens together, why have this system in the first place? Because it does give cheaper eggs hence why eggs have been so affordable in the states for so long, the downsides now come out now though when the centralized production gets hit by things (bird flu) that can completely wipe out the farm.",
