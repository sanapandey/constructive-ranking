Most Americans aren't paying attention to the news because they're working and just trying to live their lives like most people throughout history. Some people never stop looking, while a very large portion only take occasional glances into the news. Project 2025 was designed to hand the US government over within 6 months of Trump taking the presidency. That's a very fast consolidation of power, too fast for most people to process all the news at once. There's so much happening so fast that only the cherry picked pieces get a chance to appear. \n\nNot to mention there is a very large portion of the population that is actively supporting this clusterfuck who is known to have the support of the police during protests. Look at university protests compared to January 6th. How do you think a violent riot will go when people reach that breaking point? \"Yeah people have to die for change to happen.\" Be the first to volunteer. Most don't think it's bad enough to put their life and job on the line yet. It is bad enough, people just don't think or feel that it is. \n\nIt's sad, I think of 2 of my coworkers who will both be directly affected by this administration and still voice support for Trump and his practices.

You're correct that you literally can't avoid the truth in the news here. But these people have been so brainwashed to believe democrats are pure evil that anything they see painting republicans in a bad light is fake news while anything bad about democrats is completely infallible. \n\nI watched my parents actively switch from Fox news to NEWSMAX for a couple weeks because Donald Trump said to. Of course Fox news is still their favorite shit spewer along with half of America. I'm not even kidding. Fox news is playing in dentist lobbies, airports, restaurants, and more. It's not as common in cities as you might imagine, but rural areas will scream and cry if they can't have Fox and Beer. \n\nSome are coming to their senses, but most are still in the finding out phase. \n\nPersonally what I think isn't being talked about enough is project 2025's plans for nuclear deterrence. Basically, they plan to erase the idea of nuclear deterrence and increase the amount of nuclear weapons we have. I was afraid when Trump got elected that he really would rely on project2025, and then I was proven right. I'm fucking terrified for the world for the next 5-10 years.",

Despite his green card\u2014which confers the right to live and work indefinitely in the United States\u2014immigration officials are now threatening deportation, casting a shadow over his future and that of his family.\n\n# A Green Card vs. a Visa\n\nA green card is widely recognized as a symbol of lawful permanent residency. Unlike a visa, which is often temporary and accompanied by various restrictions, a green card represents a long-term commitment to the United States and carries with it protections under U.S. law. However, in this incident, the protest activities have led to actions that seem to undermine these protections.\n\n# The Arrest and Its Aftermath\n\nThe controversy began when authorities detained the protester during a demonstration in 2024. Although the demonstration was an exercise in free speech\u2014a right enshrined in the First Amendment\u2014the protester's involvement led to his detention by immigration authorities. The exact circumstances of the protest remain under investigation, but questions are now being raised about whether his arrest was justified given his permanent resident status.\n\n# Family in Peril\n\nPerhaps the most distressing aspect of the case is its collateral impact on his family. His wife, who is currently pregnant, now faces an uncertain future. Advocates argue that the potential deportation of a green card holder, especially one with a pregnant spouse, could inflict profound humanitarian harm. \u201cWhen a person with proven residency rights is treated this way, it sends a chilling message to all lawful residents,\u201d said one immigration attorney who requested anonymity.\n\n# Legal and Human Rights Concerns\n\nLegal experts are now closely examining whether the detention and potential deportation violate the rights of lawful permanent residents who engage in protected political activity. \u201cIf his removal is based purely on protest participation, we may have a situation where free speech and the right to peaceful assembly are being undermined by immigration enforcement,\u201d explained the attorney.\n\nHuman rights groups have quickly weighed in, calling on federal authorities to clarify the basis for the arrest and to ensure that the protester's constitutional rights are upheld. They assert that the current situation could set a dangerous precedent, particularly at a time when protests and civic engagement are pivotal in American democracy.\n\n# The Road Ahead\n\nUntil a formal statement is issued by the relevant immigration authorities, the full details remain shrouded in ambiguity. For now, the protester\u2019s legal team is preparing a robust challenge against the deportation threat. Meanwhile, family members and community advocates continue to rally for transparency, urging officials to reconsider the use of immigration detention in cases involving lawful permanent residents exercising their First Amendment rights.",
