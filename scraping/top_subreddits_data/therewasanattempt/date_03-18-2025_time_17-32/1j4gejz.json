This is Reddit\u2019s latest policy which will penalize users who upvote violent comments. You need to know about this, and as the \u2018initiative\u2019 has just been launched, we do not know how it will play out. We also do not know what constitutes \u2018violent\u2019 rhetoric but given the flagging of even innocuous comments over the past few weeks, it\u2019s best to be cautious.\n\nAn excerpt:\n\n\u201cSo, starting today, users who, within a certain timeframe, upvote several pieces of content banned for violating our policies will begin to receive a warning. We have done this in the past for quarantined communities and found that it did help to reduce exposure to bad content, so we are experimenting with this sitewide. This will begin with users who are upvoting violent content, but we may consider expanding this in the future. In addition, while this is currently \u201cwarn only,\u201d we will consider adding additional actions down the road.\u201d",
