In the past few weeks we have seen an uptick in comments that violate the [Reddit Rules.](https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules)\n\nLeaving comments that violate the [Reddit Rules](https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules) puts your accounts and this subreddit at risk for being banned. [Violent comments violate the Reddit Rules.](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513151-Do-not-post-violent-content ) Leaving violent comments that are explicit threats puts your own self in danger of being investigated and possibly charged by the FBI if you are a U.S. resident.\n\nFor those unawares, some weird person is doing weird things with the United States government. That person *is* terminally online enough that he will not hesitate to sic a government body on Reddit in an attempt to compel Reddit to hand over personal data about you. \n\n**Just don\u2019t do it. We will be issuing temporary-permanent bans depending for violent comments like this going forward.**\n\n*We understand that a lot of people are frustrated and worried right now..* **We are too.** *We don\u2019t even want to name the dipshit who caused this frustration because fucking ew and you already know.*\n\nWe ask that you all respect the rules of this site so that you all can continue expressing yourselves here. This is real life. The things you say on the internet can come with consequences that affect you and more than you.",
