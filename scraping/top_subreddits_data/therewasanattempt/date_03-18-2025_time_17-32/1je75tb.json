If you think about it why do you think he\u2019s crashing everything making the American public pay for not voting him in in 2020 he doesn\u2019t give a shit about the stock market because he knows everyone has their retirement money in it, releasing criminals that killed people on January 6th, constantly constantly blaming everything on Biden AND bends over backwards for Elon, he can never turn his back on him because Elon rigged the election for him.",
