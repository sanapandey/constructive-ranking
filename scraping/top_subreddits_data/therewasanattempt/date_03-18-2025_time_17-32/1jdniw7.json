I had to take a college course on global history to understand the difference between what the kids in public school are taught vs what actually has occurred. A good example is Andrew Jackson and the Trail of Tears. We are taught about it in school, but its never mentioned in the course that he explicitly ignored a supreme court ruling to take land away from native americans. We are taught in school that the US was some great liberator during WW2. When the truth is the US was fine with leaving Europe to deal with Hitler and his ilk until we suffered during Pearl Harbor. \n\nHistory repeats itself, often in a violent manner as is the case now. But when the generations are propagandized by whatever weak sauced history courses we have now, its no wonder people have trouble connecting the dots between what Andrew Jackson did then, amd what is happening now.",

On the other hand they do have the benifit of being able to stop the army from doing things that are unethical, or have sway in the government when it\u2019s necessary on an issue that affects the people (which has been done in the past by Queen Elizabeth the second), or in extreme cases overrule a government that becomes corrupt ect. Yes it\u2019s extreme hypothetical but the courts are just one check and balance, why\u2019s another one in the royal format a bad thing?\n\nPlus the system of the constitutional monarchy (in UK, Canada, Australia, ect) really dosent cost taxpayers much of anything, it\u2019s certainly not like hundreds of millions of dollars a year are going into the kings personal bank account as many people seem to think.\n\nThen again, pretty much everything I said is purely my own personal option as a Canadian. Definitely a topic that\u2019s debatable with differing viewpoints that all have merit:)\n\n(Why did I write some of this like sounding like chatGTP \ud83d\ude2d)",
