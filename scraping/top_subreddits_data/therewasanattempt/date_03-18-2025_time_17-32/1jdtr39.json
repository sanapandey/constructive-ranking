Voting doesn\u2019t work anymore, if it ever really did at all.\n\nThe system is not broken, though - it\u2019s working exactly as it\u2019s supposed to. Wealthy people founded this country to protect the wealthy - themselves - and the government they created granted them the power to overrule the people whenever they see fit. Back in the 1800s, Mark Twain said, \u201cWe have the best Congress money can buy.\u201d Nothing has changed in the power structure. The wealthy still call the shots and run things for their own benefit.\n\nThe game is rigged, as it\u2019s always been, and the only chance we have to save our society for the people and the planet is to flip the board and very specifically create a society intentionally designed to meet the needs of the people and the planet.\n\nWealthy \u201cowners\u201d have no place in this society. They do not have a right to hoard wealth created by our collective labor and the plundering of earth\u2019s resources. Those belong to us all, and we belong to each other. This vision of society is called socialism, and it works, despite all the capitalist propaganda that attempts to brainwash us to the contrary.\n\nCapitalism is inherently unstable and unsustainable, so it devolves into fascism, which holds the social order together by increasing amounts of brutality. As the social order devolves, however, it opens an opportunity not just for fascism and barbarism, but for socialism, for a new social order based on humanity, abundance, and justice.\n\nThe good news is that there is a proven method for seizing such an opportunity and decisively taking political power for the people. Raise class consciousness and join a socialist organization, and we may have a chance.\n\n\u262d",

Many of the responses to my post included fringe and radical statements that advocated for ignoring due process and straight up tyranny. It appears that supporting the rule of law and the Constitution of the United States is considered blasphemy by many in the Republican party.\n\n\u201cChiming in here from the left. When a judge rules for an injunction on a case, it means you\u2019re not allowed to take any irreversible action while we pause to hear the arguments on this case. It\u2019s a common thing to do in our judicial system, and this judge followed the book in ruling on our laws.\n\nWe liberals don\u2019t want to keep evil people in America. We want to ensure our government proves the people are evil before shipping them away. We believe in due process. Anything less is un-American in our book. As for guilty evil people, get them the hell out of here using our justice system.\n\nTo call for the impeachment of this judge is a step toward authoritarianism that feels extreme, un-Constitutional, and un-American.

If we\u2019re on Reddit, there\u2019s a good chance we already agree with you and want the same thing.\n\nBut how do we get there? That\u2019s the problem. Our politicians are straight up ignoring us - they don\u2019t appear in public, don\u2019t answer the phone, don\u2019t care about the protestors with signs.\n\nThe government isn\u2019t following the law, they are going against the constitution, ignoring judges orders.\n\nSocial media sites are cracking down on anyone organizing protests, look at Reddit\u2019s actions and the types of comments they\u2019ve suddenly started deleting for \u201cinciting v*olence\u201d. \n\nThe police are corrupt AF. They let insurrectionists into the capitol building. They were called to stop Elon\u2019s team from illegally invading the US Institution of Peace today, and instead they let him in. \n\nMost people - friends, family, colleagues either have no idea what\u2019s going on, are so terrified they have decided to just turn off the news and pretend everything is fine, or are so angry and overwhelmed they can\u2019t figure out where to direct their efforts. There is no clear organized movement to join to push back. People are scared to even pick up the phone to even try calling their reps, because they are scared they are going to end up on a list or something. \n\nSo please tell me how your average individual citizen of a suburb thousands of miles away can do anything about what\u2019s happening in DC under these conditions? I know that sounds sarcastic, but I genuinely welcome any ideas or discussion.",

There must always be an enemy, and thus fascism always eats itself.\n\nConservatives, if you think you're safe because these people are \"your people,\" you're not. They will always create reasons to make a new enemy when they run out of others. Thus, there are three possible outcomes for you if you continue on your current path:\n\n1. If you're okay with most of the other stuff, there will eventually be a line you can't or won't cross - and you'll be labeled the enemy.\n\n2. If you're just a sellout who doesn't actually believe in the fascist cause but are trying to save your own skin by parroting their beliefs, you will get tired of masking. Most people cannot maintain a facade forever, and you are not a trained spy. You *will* be found out - and you'll be labeled the enemy.\n\n3. If you are truly without empathy and remorse and are completely okay with every part of fascism, you will find yourself without any friends or supporters as everyone else gets eaten up by the machine for not being \"pure\" enough. You will have nothing and no one over which to rule. Thus, the methods by which you intend to implement your worldview will be rendered pointless. Your life will have ultimately amounted to nothing other than being an enemy to the rest of humanity.\n\nIf you support fascism, you only doom yourself, one way or another. It is inevitable. Alternatively, you could work toward the good of all people and make the world a truly better place, but that means standing up. It means turning against fascism now, before it's too late. Do you really want to look over your shoulder forever, trying to perfectly fit ever-narrowing standards of behavior and belief, and waiting for the other shoe to drop?",
