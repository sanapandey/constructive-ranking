It points out the hypocrisy of a group of people whose ancestors went through such horrible atrocities, committing those same atrocities against another people. Obviously, it's not on the same scale, but the acts themselves are eerily similar. There's also similarities between Zionism and Nazi beliefs, with both viewing one group as a chosen people and any others as needing to be exterminated or driven out of their land. And if anything, Zionism is an extension of Nazi beliefs, perpetuating that Jewish people only belong in a certain place, rather than being accepted and valued anywhere they are, just like anyone else should be.",
