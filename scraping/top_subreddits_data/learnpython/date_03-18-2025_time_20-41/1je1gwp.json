Since AI has evolved and changed almost everything; like how some jobs could be replaced with AI, I have got interested in learning ml so I could contribute to ai or even do some cool stuff. And since ml works in hand with Python, I would love to get recommendations on where or how I should start learning Python. ",

If you\u2019re totally new to Python, I\u2019d suggest starting with something like **\u201cAutomate the Boring Stuff with Python\u201d**\u2014it\u2019s free and really beginner-friendly. Once you\u2019re comfy with the basics, check out resources like **Kaggle** for hands-on machine learning projects. They have free datasets and mini-courses that\u2019ll help you see how Python fits into ML.\n\nIf you ever want more structured help or a mentor to guide you (especially once you start diving into machine learning), let me know. Happy to point you to good resources or discuss a plan to level up your skills. Good luck and have fun learning!",

Finally I really recommend staying away from ChatGPT when learning or use it sparingly. Code as much as you can, experiment, solve problems and have fun.",
