I've run through extensive steps to install pyzbar/the zbar libraries including using Home Brew and using the terminal to ensure that it's in the right directories, but it won't stop throwing the infamous import error that says: Unable to find zbar shared library. I've even found another post in this subreddit, but I didn't understand the solutions people were offering. Please tell me what to do!!!\n\nI'm using a VS Code on a 2020 M1 Macbook Pro\n\n    import os\n    import cv2\n    from pyzbar.pyzbar import decode\n    \n    # Make on method to decode the barcode\n    def barcode_reader(image):\n    \n        # read the image in numpy array using cv2\n        img = cv2.imread(image)\n    \n        # Decode the barcode image\n        detected_barcodes = decode(img)\n    \n        # if not detected then print the message\n        if not detected_barcodes:\n            print(\"Barcode not detected or your barcode is blank/corrupted!\")\n        else:\n            # Traverse through all the detected barcodes in image\n            for barcode in detected_barcodes:\n                # Locate the barcode position in image\n                (x, y, w, h) = barcode.rect\n    \n                # put the rectangle in the image using\n                # cv2 to highlight the barcode\n                cv2.rectangle(img, (x-10, y-10),\n                            (x + w+10, y + h+10),\n                            (255, 0, 0), 2)\n                \n                if barcode.data!=\"\":\n                    # print barcode data\n                    print(barcode.data)\n                    print(barcode.type)\n    \n        # Display the image\n        cv2.imshow(\"Image\", img)\n        cv2.waitKey(0)\n        cv2.destroyAllWindows()\n    \n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        # take the image from the user\n        image = \"4.jpg\"\n        barcode_reader(image)\n    ",
