    "selftext": "Hi all, I'm still learning python but would say I've got the fundamentals. However, i am currently working on a bit of a passion project of a F1 history manager like game. And I'm currently having issues with making my GUI scrollable. I've tried looking online but nothing is helpful. I would particularly like this when the race results are displayed and on the display race history page (I know this page needs working on alot). Please have a look at my project on my github: [github.com/EdLack](http://github.com/EdLack)",

You also have to use binds for that, instead of just setting the scrollbar as the scroll of the canvas... it's pretty macguyverism, and in the end you're almost programming the scroll effect from zero, but at the end it works...\n\nI wouldn't recommend doing it without some experiencs, and you'll be knocking your head against a hard wall while learning it.",

It unreasonable to ask people to search through a lot of code to try and guess where the \"race results are displayed and on the display race history page\" is.  Post some example code that demonstrates what you want to do either here or on pastebin.com (automatically preserves indents).",
