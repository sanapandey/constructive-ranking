President Trump issued an executive order attempting to erase the existence of trans, intersex, and nonbinary people, and denying them equal rights and treatment under the law. But trans, intersex and non-binary people are our friends, our neighbors, our coworkers, and our family members. I do not support this discrimination.**I urge you to reject this policy change.**\n\nAll of us, including transgender, intersex and non-binary people, need accurate and consistent identity documents that reflect who we are. That\u2019s what identification documents are for. These documents allow us to travel, start new jobs, open bank accounts, and enroll in school.\n\nEvery citizen deserves a U.S. passport that matches who they are to ensure they can safely travel with dignity and safety, obtain employment, interact with law enforcement, and go about their daily lives without fear of harassment, undue scrutiny, and discrimination.\n\nIt is a burden on passport applicants to be asked for evidence of sex assigned at birth, and it is a waste of government time and resources to require State Department employees to research this information. Such measures amount to a violation of right to privacy.\n\nThis new policy targets an already marginalized population of the United States and denies them identification documents they need to safely travel and live their lives.\n\n**I urge you to reject this policy change** \u2013**do not take away the rights of trans, intersex, and non-binary citizens to obtain a passport that reflects who they are, a right they\u2019ve had in the United States for over 30 years.**\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n",
