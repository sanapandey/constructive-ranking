It was exactly the same thing as Power Rangers did in live action, only even cheaper, because almost no extra footage was produced. And while I'm sure they did their best, these 70s, 80s, and 90s anime imports were often terrible representations of their source material. There are similar stories in other markets, when the US version wasn't just exported with even more subtitles.   \n  \nBad translations, bad and super-fast dubs, terrible cuts for censorship, or just cramming unrelated shows together to get enough episodes for syndication, it was a wild west of business and production.   \n  \nVoltron and Robotech are famously so butchered compared to their original series that they're basically their own entities outside of Japan. The Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and Yu-Gi-Oh dubs are so bad in places that there are entire generations who have a markedly different experience of their respective franchises. \n\nThe \"japanimation\" you remember from when you were a kid is about as authentically Japanese as the instant ramen in my pantry.
