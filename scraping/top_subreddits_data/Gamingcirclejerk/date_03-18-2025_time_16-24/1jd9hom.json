These women did night raids that did a pretty significant psychological damage on German troops since they would turn off their engines before bombing, gliding in the night over enemy positions and drop their bombs. The only noise from them was the wind over the planes, which to the Germans sounded like what you\u2019d imagine a witch flying on her broom would sound like.\n\nThey flew over 23,000 sorties when at their largest they only had 40 two-person crews and many pilots flew over 800 missions in a time when going on 50 was considered pretty good for the Americans and Brits.\n\n23 of the \u201cNight Witches\u201d were awarded Hero of the Soviet Union.",

Just like I assume most people wouldn't want a movie with a realistic audio/conversation/daily living reel.\n\nImagine the next marvel movie including all the scenes where the protagonist greet, small talk, brush hair and teeth, wash face, clean dishes, go to work, drive Toyota Corolla to work and home, get stuck in traffic, kiss wife, do sex, go to sleep etc.etc. and maybe 15 minutes of the movie is of them using their powers.\n\nThe interesting thing about gaming discourse is there's some sentiment where we don't want reality... Average looking women being everywhere = bad, paraplegic supporting character that is useful = bad, Minorities in Miami on GTA6 = bad, Modern day politics = bad. But then two post down that same person arguing against realism will claim that a game is bad for not having realism. There's so much Hypocrisy in gaming discourse it's actually wild these bullies actually expect to be heard.",

And its often overlooked, but it came down to women to defend their homes from raiders if the regular fighting men were away, so many women throughout our history would have had to have been competent at fighting even if they didn't go to war.",

Unfortunately, when you mention Sargon of Akkad, you have to be clear you mean the historic figure, so, bleh :/",

Seems to fit the catholic church doctrine to me. The whole purpose of life is to suffer and eventually die to be rewarded in death by a place in heaven. And if you feel like you're suffering unjustly, then you're either not a devout enough follower and are being punished, or you need to think about what lesson God might be teaching you and what the purpose of this suffering is so that you can be rewarded when you die and go to heaven. It's a great ideology for keeping the poor and undesirable in their place, hence it's usage by kings, slave owners, and oligarchs. \n\nAnyway thank you for taking my shitpost seriously, for some reason.",

                            "body": ">It just shows a lack of genuine imagination.\n\nHave you considered that it requires a lot of imagination to work within confines? I often remember the requirements of Gene Roddenberry on the writers for Star Trek - things like 'no interpersonal drama, no relationship issues' etc. And while they hamstrung some aspects, it really drew out the creativity of the writers.\n\nIt's not exactly required to be fully immersed in a fantasy world, but if that world has magic that precludes certain physical conditions then there's an argument made of that to be breaking immersion. Whether or not that's a group priority is another question, but it's not exactly moot. While the goal is to have fun, people seek different means and ends for their entertainment and so it would require an imaginative solution to find a compromise, rather than insisting one way or the other.\n\nWhile there's always the 'curse' option, that still insinuates a desire for the player to have a goal contradictory to their motive. So perhaps there's a playable species without legs, or there's a religious vow (might be up Ilmater's alley), or like polymorph gone wrong where their lower half is an ooze but it's actually working out pretty good. There's obviously a lot more, and better ideas out there, but if this is something you care about then hopefully you can bring something innovative to your next session.\n\nI'm not trying to judge anyone's creativity, though I'd encourage you to do the same if the response to hesitation results in other players losing immersion.",

Historians warn, that you cannot have an exact picture, how they lived, because most of the records were made by nobles, merchants and (edit)priests on their perspective, not of the peasants.\n\nSo the most truthful answer is: \"we don't know\" and can only make educated guesses.",

It's about the fact that they had to reach to find the one black person in Japan at that moment in history... in a franchise where none of the playable protagonists have \"actually existed\" up to this point.\n\nThe point the other side doesn't make is that this decision is absolutely a fall-back decision so that any and all backlash to the assumed mediocrity (they haven't had a stellar reputation for output lately) can be chocked up to \"racism\". There is absolutely no other reason to reach deep into the most obscure japanese lore and pull out \"the one black guy who actually existed.\" So we get a black guy in the Egypt game (bayek), but now instead of getting an asian guy in asian part of world, especially one in a period notorious for not having a whole lot of diversity, we get this fucking clown?\n\nDenying that it's pandering is just as stupid as caring that much about it. But I guarantee you if the game sucks and people call it out it won't matter how solid their points are, a large part of the \"fanbase\" are going to defend it for whatever weird social rhetoric it inspires about \"racism\"..\n\nThis is the exact type of shit people complained about when The Last Samurai came out, pretending that it's suddenly ok when it's \"literally anyone but a white guy even if it's MORE absurd\" is simply hypocrisy. Which only applies to the people who gave that movie shit or other \"whitewashing\" of a similar nature.",

See people tend to gravitate to other people who share their beliefs and ideas; if the people you're speaking to are agreeing with you it's likely because they belong to the same cohort as you do.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of gamers in Japan probably care about the same things as gamers in the rest of the world... fun and engaging gameplay. If they're upset about historical inaccuracies in a series that's rife with historical inaccuracies, but *only* the one time those inaccuracies involve a black protagonist... well it's probably not the historical inaccuracies that they're *actually* upset about.

They see Japan as an ally of the white race and China as an irredeemable enemy of it.  They've always seen blacks and every flavor of Muslim to be the enemy, and in recent decades have made Hispanics their biggest enemy of all followed by LGBT folks and leftist women.\n\nAny movie or game that promotes any of those forbidden \"enemies\" stepping outside of their \"lane\" is immediately attacked by these bigots as DEI.  Black dude in feudal Japan, women soldiers in WW2, trans person in a fantasy world with literal magic, all of these are immediately attacked in the modern era.  None of these things would've been seen as a problem prior to the rise of Gamergate in 2014 and the MONUMENTAL amount of Russian money and psyops thrown at turning angry incels into their weapon to destroy the US from within.",

Yes, but there are also many people who dont have a racist bone in their body who look at this and also get annoyed.\n\nYou are actively defending willful ignorance via bias in your statement here. This is what I was responding to. I was not off-topic, and you are actively lying and engaging in deflection by insisting otherwise.\n\n>This is why society is starting to turn away from the liberal strangle hold that has been applied since 2008, it is impossible to talk to yall objectively. \n\nNow you've assumed I'm liberal with no evidence whatsoever to suggest that.

For example, instead of inserting black people into Lord of the Rings, why not create a whole new epic story based on African mythology? Id LOVE to watch that, and learn the lore that comes from Africa, but instead they just say \"I have an idea this character is white originally, let make them black!!!\"\n\nBy this point . . .

Your insane ramblings are getting *out of hand*.\n\n>You are just defending your ideology, not taking things into consideration, I can agree 100% there are racists who will just hate anything with a black person in it, of course, but that a blanket statement because they will always be there, when the point im trying to convey is there is also groups of people out there who are simply tired of the insertion for insertion sake, but thats too much for your brain to comprehend that people can dislike things based on other things. \n\nYou have yet to respond to the questions I asked and the reasoning I provided without deflecting, lying, and engaging in fallacious reasoning.\n\nYou have demonstrated yourself to be biased, dishonest, and critically incapable.

But we do know he was considered a close-friend and ally of Nobunaga, was granted a stipend and possibly sword (we don't know for sure if he had his own shinken or had the honor of carrying Nobunaga's shinken), and was well respected.
