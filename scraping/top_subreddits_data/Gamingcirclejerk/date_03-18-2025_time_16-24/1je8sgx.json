To the guy that's like \"the game is, quite literally: Kill Nazis, then some more.\" I can't speak on Enemy Territory, but the game that guy is talking about sounds like Wolfenstein 3D. Which has a paper-thin plot and had Nazis be the bad guys is because they don't want you have remorse in killing other humans. Which, that's still political, it expresses the view of the devs of who they find to be pure evil. Ya can't deny the Bethesda games have more going on in their story.",
