I waited. \n\nThey got uncomfortably silent for several minutes and then just walked away. \n\nPeople who screech about Woke being bad are just cowards who don't want to say what they really mean.",

Some dude said some shit like he doesn\u2019t know about airplane pilots but DEI is a huge problem because unqualified people are being put in serious positions of power due to DEI & it\u2019s concerning. I asked the dude to give me 5 examples & he ghosted the conversation.  I think I broke his brain.",
