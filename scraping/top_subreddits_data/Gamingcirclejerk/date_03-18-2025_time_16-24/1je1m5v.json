Imagine his shock when he comes to find out that Rockstar has been making fun of Republicans in ways that still apply to this day since 2008. He'd be calling the game woke once he heard all of the Weazel news radio segments and how they're absolutely clowning on right wingers and their politics. The Angels of Death have a website and they basically say something like \"We're not racist but we do just make the tests to get in harder if you're black\".  You ever notice how GTA makes fun of both sides but when it makes fun of the right, it doesn't just make fun of Republicans but also what they believe and when they do the left, it's only a cartoon character of a person they're making fun of? I don't think OOP did.",
