I think that what you're hinting at is that Liberalism has always favored those in power with nepotism and cronyism, there is inherently an in and out group and everyone in those days wasn't a part of \"the people.\" Native Americans and enslaved Africans never got a piece of the American Liberal Ideology, but White settlers did, absolutely. \n\nIf we're talking about the government providing a decent life, what constitutes that life has changed dramatically in the past 300 or so years. During and before Manifest Destiny all that meant was systemically defending your right to conquer and own land, it soon evolved into a government mail service, expansion of Western civilization, and a right to own people namely and property subsequently. \n\nIn our modern times, this is not substantial for a \"decent\" life, and as such Liberalism has expanded greatly, but a left liberal and a right liberal were completely different, though Liberal all the same. I think that you may be underestimating the value of government assistance in a time where there was no electricity or running water. The fact that you could get the government to send marshals to kill Native Americans indiscriminately was a significant part of White settlers living a \"decent\" life, for example.",

It's been happening since the controversy around Mass Effect, they know just having a gay or POC MC is enough to incite online trolls.  Since trolls don't actually think things through and just fly off the handle with knee jerk reactions, they provide tons of free advertising in their half assed attempts to attack the properties.\n\nThe real problem is when the trolls go too far and start becoming stochastic terrorists.

But it turned out Blizzard kept him in an office far away from everyone because of how hated he was. A former co-worker outed him as the breast milk thief that was part of the shit that went on in blizzard during the 2000s and 2010s under Mike Morhaime (this started before Vivendi bought Activision and put them under the Activision-Blizzard holding company).\n\nLeft/Sacked and founded a new company, was such a terrible person they got rid of him.\n\nThen tried to make a name for himself jumping on the demands for blizzard to make wow vanilla servers (before wow classic was announced).\n\nStarted a crowdfunding for a game he's supposed to be developing but instead in the past few years cries about \"woke\" in games about the same amount as Jk Rowling cries about the existence of transgender people.",
