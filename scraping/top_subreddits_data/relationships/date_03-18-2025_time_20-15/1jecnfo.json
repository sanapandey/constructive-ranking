    "selftext": "\nMy partner and I recently started living together in his newly bought home, a 4-bed. He requested that I not pay rent, which I suspect is because he wants to avoid any potential claims on the property if we get married and later divorce. However, I contribute to other expenses like groceries, internet, energy, and water bills.\n\nThe issue is that I like a cozy, decorated home with rugs, pictures, plants, and general home decor. My partner, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t see the need for these things. Since he wasn\u2019t interested in getting them himself, I volunteered to buy rugs for the bedroom and living room, throw cushions, plants, a center table, and other small decor items.\n\nWhen I mentioned this to him, he insisted that he needed to see and approve everything before I bought it. While I understand wanting a say in what goes into the home, his wording made me uncomfortable. He said, \"You cannot just bring anything into my house. If I don\u2019t want or like it, then it can\u2019t be here.\"\n\nThis level of control extends to other things too, like not being able to buy something for the kitchen without him questioning why I got it when I bought it and why I didn\u2019t ask first. Because of this, I\u2019ve started to feel like I\u2019m just a guest in his home rather than a partner building a life with him.\n\nHe has also mentioned that he wants a prenup, stating that what he had before marriage remains his. But if that\u2019s the case, why does it matter if I decorate? No matter what I add to the space, the house is still his legally, right? I am also not doing too much, just bits and pieces there to make the house less naked.\n\nPart of me wants to just leave things as they are and stop trying. If he doesn\u2019t see this as our home and isn\u2019t open to us making it one together, then maybe I shouldn\u2019t bother. At the same time, I wonder if I should try to work within his boundaries and get his approval first, and maybe he\u2019ll come around once he sees the changes.\n\nBut then I ask myself: why should I try so hard to contribute when he doesn\u2019t seem to want me to?\n\nHe gave me a room that also doubles as the house storage and my studio, which, despite sharing it with \"things,\" I am grateful for. He has told me I can make some changes to it, but how many changes can I make with the equipment I share the room with? Also, I have always wanted my home to look a certain way, and now being denied of that just feels very sad.\n\nIt's quite tough because when we were assembling the bed, he didn't let me help out. I sensed that it was because he didn't trust me to do well. The only thing he allowed me to assemble was the bathroom cabinet and when I was done he was like, \"did you do it well, are you sure you screwed it well\".\n\nRight now, I feel like I\u2019m living in a borrowed space, with nothing truly mine beyond my clothes. It all feels temporary, and that unsettles me. At the same time, I feel guilty for even feeling this way. Some people have partners who don\u2019t care at all about the home, and here I am, upset that mine is involved and wielding so much control over it.\n\nI don\u2019t know if anyone here has experienced this before and will be willing to share some insights into how to deal with this. \n\nThank you.\n\nTL;DR: Moved in with my boyfriend (M29) into his newly bought house. I don\u2019t pay rent but contribute to groceries and bills. I like a cozy, decorated home, but he sees no point in decor. When I offered to buy rugs, plants, and a center table, he insisted on approving everything first and said, \"You can\u2019t just bring anything into my house.\" I can\u2019t even buy small kitchen items without being questioned. This makes me feel like a guest rather than a partner. How can I deal with this?",
