    "selftext": "I\u2019m in a friendship that I think might be toxic for the past year and a half. I\u2019m single 42F, he\u2019s a single 37M. \n\nI am attracted to him, and he\u2019s admitted attraction to me at times, but he also struggles with his sexuality so I don\u2019t feel comfortable trying to move past friendship when I think he\u2019s still trying to figure that out. He\u2019s also admitted being attracted to other people but no relationships with anyone in about 4 years.\n\nHe\u2019s also admitted being a functional alcoholic. This is a big issue for me partially because I worry about him, but also because I have alcoholism in my family and I don\u2019t want that in my relationship. Sometimes this makes it hard to even be friends because all he wants to do is go drink, or he doesn\u2019t have \u201cdeep conversations\u201d unless he\u2019s been drinking.\n\nHe\u2019s very up and down as well. I don\u2019t always know what to expect and sometimes that makes it hard to count on him as a friend and he\u2019s hurt me a good bit because of this. Everything tends to have to be convenient for or about him.\n\nI truly believe he\u2019s a good person and I care about him. However, I feel like he completely deregulates my nervous system when I spend much time with him. I feel physically safe but for some reason, not psychologically safe. He would never purposely hurt me but he stresses me out so much sometimes because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming next. \n\nThe kicker\u2026 due to recent changes at work, we have to work together now. So I can\u2019t just go no contact but I don\u2019t know how to back away from him without hurting him. But if I don\u2019t, he will continue to hurt me. What do I do?\n\nTL;DR A toxic friendship has developed and I don\u2019t know how to handle it, especially now that we work together. \n",

Tipsy or buzzed people, I can deal with, but someone who's gonna be a messy drunk and get mad like that, I'd sooner leave.\n\nAnd leaving that situation isn't bad, Hun. He can be a good person deep down like you said but just no be on a speed setting you can deal with at the moment. I had a neighbor who was quite nice. She was also addicted to crack.\n\nI'm not a bad person for not wanting to be around that. I just am not going to put myself in that situation.\n\nI think, at 42, it's time to tell him you can't hang out as much as you used to. You're a grown woman, and you can say hey I don't wanna be around alcohol or people who are drinking right now, it's just not for me. Hell, make yourself less available to be around him. Go out with some friends more often, get into a class, pick up a hobby to spend your time on. \n\nBe polite at work, but just stop hanging out with him outside of work.",
