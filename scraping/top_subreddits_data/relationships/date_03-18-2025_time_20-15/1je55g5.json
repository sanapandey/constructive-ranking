    "selftext": "First off sorry for the long post. Please bear with me. TLDR at end.\n\nI (F33) have been with my partner (M36) for almost 16 years. The past 5.5 have been with kids. \nHere is the issue, my partner is kind of a miserable human to be around during vacations. For example, our son gets really car sick on extended car rides (he will puke if it's 30+ minutes long). It's a for sure thing he will puke. My partner gets pisssssed with a capital P, when our son pukes. My partner will say things like \"are you f*ing kidding me?! Why do you always have to do this sh*t?!...\". I get so pissed at him because I am always the one to clean him up so idk how it affects him personally.\nAnyways that's just one example. \n\nThe issue is, my partners great grandparents are pretty old (90s) have a lot of health issues. This is the reason he wants to go back to his home land, so the kids can meet them and his mom (her first grand kids). I get the excitement of wanting to introduce them to his family back home (I get it especially since I lost my grandma 2 weeks before my son was born) but I am anxious to go because I know what's to come.\nLet's put it this way, we just recently went to the happiest place on earth and he was complying the WHOLE time that is was \"boring\" and nothing of what he expected. Didn't help with the kids until I asked. Just a lot of stress and anxiety. \nI don't like to travel/vacation with him but I understand why he wants to go.\n\nBasically I am asking for advice on how to deal with his immanturaty during this trip while also having fun myself?\n\nFYI: I honestly wouldn't let him go without me if he were to take the kids. He knows I don't trust him alone with my kids - not because he does anything innapropriate but because he's an easily triggered individual that snaps at anyone really quick. I have told him how I feel before but he is dismissive of my feelings, both of vacationing with him and him being alone with kids.\n\nTLDR; my partners great grandparents are old/sick in homeland so partner wants to visit them with our kids but I am anxious because he is a miserable person to travel/vacation with. How do I deal with his immaturity while also having fun myself?",

Did you say, for example, \"if you cannot be calm about our son getting sick in a moving car, we should just not go on this trip\".   You say \"I have told him how I feel before\", what did you actually say and when? IE, did you tell him in the moment \"you're ruining this trip\"?\n\nYour partner is being a turd, what you can do about it is things to initiate a change beforehand.  Basically, you need to tell him either he changes his behavior or you refuse to go on the trip, it's not worth it. Cite specific examples, give specific things you need to see changed.",

Don't subject your kids to his temper. Please reevaluate your situation. I know in some circumstances it's better to stay because you don't want to risk shared custody and him being alone with the kids- but man. This is really sad. You can't manage his immaturity or temper- he has to do that. All you can do is refuse to be around it. Go without him. Or send him on his own. He already ruined the happiest place on earth. How much more is he going to ruin?",

You didn't mentiom the son's age but even toddlers can learn to use them (sort of). \n\nAs to your guy being a miserable pos during trips, there's not a lot to be done unless he agrees he's a miserable pos and should learn some coping mechanisms and stress reduction skills so he doesn't ruin it for everyone (again). And that's basically what I would tell him \"You ruin every trip with your moods and inability to deal with stress. I'm sorry your grandparents are aging and not doing well but we're not doing family trips unless you stop being such a miserable, snappy jerk\".",

I've been with my now fiancee for over 6 years, no kids yet. We don't fight, argue, call eachother names. We talk things through like adults. We aren't some stuck up old people though. We love to have fun, go out, play video games daily. We communicate though.\n\nIf this happened to me we would sit down after and I would say,\n\n \"Hey, what can we do in the future to make sure you enjoy our family vacations? I would like to figure this out so they aren't all like the last one where I feel like you were sissy, and just checked out. A relationship is 50/50, and that's what I need from you. When it comes to road trips, unfortunately we know our kid has issues. So I would like to not make a big deal of it, and maybe over time find some ways to mitigate it. I feel like it doesn't really effect you though, as i take care of all the cleanup and fuss. While we're on the subject, we need to discuss a more equal spread of chores and taking care of the kiddos. Again we are partners, a team, and im starting to feel like i do a large share of the work\"\n\nThen you have a discussion and figure shit out. There's no other magic words this reddit or anyone else can tell you. This is how healthy relationships work.",

            "body": "Damn, I can't imagine spending my life with somebody who I didn't look forward to vacations with, or who I didn't feel comfortable leaving our kids with because he has such anger problems.\n\nHave you talked to him about his anger problems and how it turns what should be a source of joy into a source of pain? What ultimately needs to happen is he needs to get anger management/emotional regulation help. I would suggest communicating your expectations for the trip to him in advance, and let him know that if he can't keep it together and be pleasant and not have any outbursts, then you want him to start therapy to improve his emotional regulation. If he is not open to that, then I don't know how comfortable I'd be spending my whole life with somebody who sucks the fun out of every trip we go on, who I can't trust to be alone with his own kids, and who is a terrible role model. I'd think long and hard about what your kids are learning from seeing how your husband comports himself, and about what they are learning by seeing you stay by his side no matter how awful he gets. I would really push for the therapy, for everybody's sake.\n\nIn terms of managing the vacation itself, I'd talk about expectations in advance - sometimes being primed in advance to handle a problem like your son puking can help with the emotional regulation in the moment. I would ask how your partner is going to react when that happens, and get some buy-in from him. It might feel a bit infantilizing to be doing that, but he's acting like a child, so that's what has to happen. I would also let him know that if he has any outbursts, that you are not going to let it ruin the day for you and the kids, so you are going to send your partner away from the family for the rest of the day to cool off while you and the kids do fun stuff together. If he can't just have a fun time with you and the kids, then don't let him drag you three down. Ultimately, none of these management strategies are ideal - what really needs to happen is that your partner needs to grow as a person and make a commitment to being a better partner and father.",

I wouldn't want to go either, but it is understandable that he wants to visit his aging grandparents.  Usually we have these conversations in the heat of the moment when everyone is already tired and overwhelmed on vacation and this is rarely productive.  If he really is adamant about wanting to go, sit him down and ask him how you can mitigate the inevitable stresses before they ever happen.  For example: Get your child motion sickness glasses, fly instead of driving and make sure to schedule travel times to accommodate normal sleeping schedules.",
