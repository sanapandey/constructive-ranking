    "selftext": "Throwaway obviously. My husband and I have been together for 9 years, married for a few months. We bought a home and have been disagreeing on how bills and discretionary income should be split. I (30F) am the breadwinner, I make 3x his salary. We have agreed to split the bills proportional to our income (his idea, but I think it's fair). \n\nOur issue is that I think the money leftover after bills should be split the same way, 2/3 to me and 1/3 to him. He thinks our discretionary income should be split 50/50 or that we should be making joint decisions on all of the leftover money and is adamant that I'm not viewing things the right way, and that we are supposed to be a unit and a team and make decisions together.\n\nEven though I get where he's coming from, I ultimately don't think it's fair for me to pay for most of our expenses and not be able to spend a portion of the money how I want to. The whole thing makes me feel claustrophobic and trapped. I had initially wanted a prenup, but he was against it and I ultimately compromised because I do view us as a team and want to be more open to sharing our life in all ways. Im trying really hard to compromise and be a good wife. I'm just frustrated right now and could use some perspective. For additional context, before this relationship, I was in a really abusive relationship and have become a bit hyper-independent as a result. I am in therapy and working on that.\n\nMarried folks of reddit, how do you manage money? Am I completely in the wrong here?\n\nEdited to add: my husband does almost all of the housework (cooking, cleaning, groceries). I hire a maid to come once or twice a month for a deep clean but otherwise don\u2019t contribute to household chores.\n\nTLDR; Husband wants us to approach discretionary income as 50/50 or our money. I think it\u2019s fair that if I am proportionally contributing more to the bills, I have more spending money.\n",

            "body": "Yeah, it sounds weird to want to split bills 70/30 but discretionary money 50/50 -- especially when one person is pushing for both of those things. The fact that he was against a prenup because y'all are a \"team\" is also a red flag to me, but I don't know your relationship.\n\nFinance options include:\n\n\\- Pooling all of your money (only if you trust him not to spend all y'all's money or track your spending and hold it over you)\n\n\\- You both put money proportionate to your income into a shared account for household expenses (bills, repairs, furniture, family vacations) and have your personal bank accounts for discretionary spending.",

He was the breadwinner in his former marriage but his late spouse totally mismanaged the money. I mean IRS/ bankruptcy level mismanagement. I was the breadwinner in my former marriage with a man who couldn\u2019t seem to keep a job over three years at a time. \n\nThose are experiences neither one of us want to relive as we are both within 5-7 years of retirement. We very much love and trust one another\u2014 we do believe that this marriage will be til death do us part .. but neither of us is naive to think the worst couldn\u2019t happen. We have decided to have one account for household expenses. I make about mid six figures and he averages about a third of what I do. \n\nWe will live in my home as it\u2019s paid off and sell his with some of that cash set aside in case we need improvements on my property over the years. He is paid weekly and I am paid semi monthly. Our plan is to take two checks from his pay (at his insistence) and one from mine for bills and savings. His other two pay periods and my other semi monthly payment will be personal discretionary savings.\n\nShould the marriage unfortunately end we plan on creating a prenup that says we split the money in the shared accounts, he keeps his inheritance money and the rest of the money from the sale of his house, I keep my property, and we each keep whatever is in our separate accounts.  For us, this was the fairest, most logical decision for our circumstances. \n\nThe fact that your husband refused a prenup, wants to pay proportionally to income for expenses but wants to split discretionary income in half gives me pause, OP. Not to compare our situations but I had to argue the point with my fianc\u00e9 about how he wanted and is more than willing to put half his income into the joint account for our benefit. He is always trying to find ways to give me more and not take anything away from me that he feels I\u2019ve worked hard for. We will split the chores and also have lawn service. \n\nIn your position, I would probably say that a post nuptial agreement may give you more security about your assets prior to your marriage to allow you to feel comfortable with what he\u2019s proposing. We all want to believe that we are in relationships that will stand the test of time but practicality also has a place in a romantic relationship. \n\nJust my two cents. What works in my house may not work for everyone else but I do urge you to consider what your gut is saying to you.",

We came to an agreement pretty quickly, but I think it ultimately came down to the fact that it would feel super weird if my husband was living lavishly and I was living like a pauper all under the same roof. \n\nWe pool our money, so we\u2019re both contributing to bills and both have access to basically the same amount of fun money. I think you and your husband might like a budgeting app. We use Monarch. It\u2019s great because you can both talk about your financial goals, set budgets for all the categories in your life, and track your spending in real time. Since you have a history of abuse, it might make you feel more comfortable to be able to know with certainty that no funny business is going on with the money. And your husband might benefit from the clarity of a budget. It\u2019s hard to fight about money when you\u2019ve set up your parameters in advance and hold yourself accountable to them. Then you both can spend freely in line with what you\u2019ve agreed upon in the budget. \n\nIt\u2019s hard because no one ever talks about this. My parents have been happily married for 30+ years and have good finances, but even they never talked to me about managing money. I grew up with them, and I\u2019m still unsure of how they managed the budget on a daily basis. All that to say, it might feel a little weird at first to have an in depth \u201cproject meeting\u201d basically about your budget. But that weird feeling is just because it\u2019s new to you, and a lot of us are experiencing the same thing. Once you get the hang of it, it\u2019s awesome though and gives you so much mental freedom and less anxiety. \n\nAlso! You\u2019re going to want to have a little money meeting at the end of each month. Just to see how you did, what\u2019s working, what\u2019s not working, what should be changed, etc. Another thing is that you get to see if you have any extra money left over from the month, and you can roll that into next month. Monarch lets you do that in your budget, so you can track it easily. \n\nYour budget also doesn\u2019t need to be your be all and end all. Obviously don\u2019t be reckless for no reason, but if your fun budget is $100 over this month, that\u2019s ok. You can compensate in other areas. Something I like about Monarch is that you can roll leftover money in one budget category into another category. So if you didn\u2019t spend much on eating out this month but you spent extra on car expenses this month, you can move that money into the car category. I promise this isn\u2019t an ad for Monarch lol it\u2019s just been SO helpful for me and my husband!",
