    "selftext": "We were high and cuddling in bed last night when I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to have sex. He said he was tired and wanted to sleep, so I said okay and that I would probably have to move to the couch and take care of myself before I could go to sleep because I was a little too worked up to ignore it and I didn\u2019t want to bother him.\n\nHe got really offended at that and I was confused. He said if the roles were reversed and he had blue balls but I didn\u2019t want to have sex, I\u2019d get mad at him if he said he was gonna go jerk off to take care of it. I did not actually feel that way, and told him if that happened I would understand it\u2019s not about me and he has physical needs, so if I can\u2019t help him with that I\u2019d totally understand him having to go and take care of it himself.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything for a moment and then when I prompted to ask him what he thought about that he suddenly pushed me off of him saying \u201cget the fuck off of me.\u201d That took me really off guard and I can\u2019t stop thinking about it, because up until that point I had no idea he was actually getting mad.\n\nHe started pacing around the room and locked himself in the bathroom for a while, and when he came back and saw I was still in bed he said \u201cwhat, not gonna go grab your vibrator? not gonna go to the couch and beat your shit?\u201d in a mocking voice. I just stayed silent and got up and went to the couch cause I had no idea what to do. He got really mad at that and grabbed his keys and up and left. At this point I was quietly crying and I finally asked him if this was something he wanted to break up over right before he went out the door (I was getting super emotional and had never seen him like this even in past arguments, and he\u2019d never stormed off this angry at me before, so that\u2019s what made me ask) and he said something along the lines of wishing I just wouldn\u2019t say shit that makes him go to the gym to get over it.\n\nHe left around 12 AM and then like 10 minutes later he texted me saying he was just gonna drive around because he had work early. My head had gotten a little clearer at this point so I texted him about how he had pushed me out of anger because that had bothered me. He told me it was because he didn\u2019t want me touching him after saying \u201cthe vilest shit\u201d but apologized if he pushed me too hard and to do what I want because he doesn\u2019t control me.\n\nHe then started sending me concerning messages saying it was getting harder to keep his emotions in check and about being suicidal, saying he didn\u2019t want to be anyones problem anymore. I called him immediately and I told him to come home right now and he refused. I checked his location and told him I\u2019d call the cops if he didn\u2019t come home, so he finally did.\n\nHe got home around 3 AM and I was still on the couch in the bedroom. He got into bed. After 10 minutes I asked him if I could rejoin him on the bed because I was just really concerned about him now. He said okay and I tried to comfort him by cuddling again and he seemed to reciprocate, so we fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms. I thought all was well for some stupid reason.\n\nIn the morning however once he woke up it was like a switch flipped again and he would barely look at me before he left for work. While I was still sleeping he passive aggressively pulled off the covers off of me, said bye and left.\n\nNow I\u2019m just left feeling really weird and I don\u2019t know how to move forward.\n\nTLDR; boyfriend too tired to have sex, I said it was okay and I\u2019ll just masturbate. boyfriend pushes me and storms off, later texts me that he pushed me because what I said was vile and that he has suicidal thoughts.",

Next time around, look for a man from the current century, someone who appreciates women who can take care of their own needs when partnered sex is not on the table.

All these freedoms go out the window with a guy with these traits and behaviors which will only escalate. If you call a domestic violence hotline, you can get someone to talk to about what happened, resources and next steps. \n\nIf you\u2019re conflicted because of your feelings for him, know this: a relationship where one person is the therapist to the other is not real love. You are not responsible for him in that way and you aren\u2019t qualified to help him as you are not a therapist. There\u2019s a balance of leaning on the other but angry moods where he acts like a toddler tyrant and doesn\u2019t listen when you are being yourself, then making you have to manage his emotions is wrong. You can\u2019t thrive if your autonomy isn\u2019t respected. Please choose yourself.",
