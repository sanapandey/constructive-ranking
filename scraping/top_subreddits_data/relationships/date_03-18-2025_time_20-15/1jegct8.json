    "selftext": "Please help\n\n\nHey everyone,\nI am so stressed out. Basically me (22,f) and my girlfriend (21,f) of about 18 months now,have got an opportunity to move out together. The apartment is really easily obtained as her step mum works for the people who are leasing it. \n\n\nA few months ago I was sure that I wanted to move out of home, things were stressful and I had decided I wanted to. \n\n\nFast forward to the apartment being ready. I have no idea what in the world I want. We are applying tomorrow and I can\u2019t decide what the hell to do, everytime I think about it I choke up. I don\u2019t want to leave my mum. We have been through so much in the last few years. Mum lost her best friend and I lost mine too. I\u2019m also worried for my sister as she is a bit depressed. Recently also my granny died unexpectedly (she lived with us so it hit hard).\n\n\nMy main issue is that I so badly WANT TO WANT to move out if that makes sense, I want to be excited for this but everytime it\u2019s brought up I try and beat around the bush/ do anything but talk about it. My girlfriend knows how I feel and she is fine with it, she\u2019s being great. But some part of me just wishes I wanted to do this with her. \n\n\nI definitely think I need some sort of therapy cuz I always have this irrational feeling that my family\nIs gonna die, especially after all the previous traumas. I\u2019m just so upset and don\u2019t know what to do. \n\n\nOh also must mention- her home rn is very small and shared with young siblings, she doesn\u2019t have much space and it\u2019s dfieintly never independent space. However me, I\u2019ve got a great big house in the countryside with space for everything! If anyone has any two cents please do add. I am so lost. I feel like a shell of myself. Thank you for reading\n\n\n\nTL:DR my girlfriend wants to move out and I don\u2019t know if I do",

You know how to cook, do laundry, pay bills, all that good stuff?\n\nDo you feel your relationship with your girlfriend is stable? You've been together long enough to know each other fairly well, so you should have good feelings about cohabiting with her.\n\nIf both of those are true, then moving out should be fine. You can be supportive of your family even when you aren't living with them. It may be that you would feel more needed at home...but would you be doing something that might hinder someone else from doing what they need to do?\n\nHow far away would you be moving? Hours away, or just fifteen minutes?",

Myself, I ended up moving into an off-campus place late in my freshman year of college, and just stayed put.\n\nUnless your mom and sister have some sort of debilitating condition, it is probably better for you to move out, and get yourself established as an adult. Even if they *do* have something, you should only postpone your moveout until your mom can arrange some sort of alternate care (I mean, what would she do if you weren't around, anyway?).\n\nAs a parent, I try to encourage my kids to learn how to do things, and to figure out what they can do when they are on their own. I will not always be there for them. I'm not kicking them out, but I want them to feel it is right to go elsewhere and be on their own, that they don't have to keep coming back.\n\nAs you said, you might need therapy. You shouldn't feel like everyone is depending on you. You should feel helpful, but not essential, to your family. if you are afraid something terrible will happen if you aren't there, you need to examine those feelings. Do you have some reason for that? Has anyone said anything to you that suggests they are in danger, or might harm someone, or anything like that?",

Lots of things have been ripped away from me and I feel like they will be too . \n\nMy mum is supportive of the idea and isn\u2019t making it a scene and giving me a reason to stay, it all solely comes from me. \n\nI am sure that everything will probably be fine if I was to leave but I just can\u2019t stop thinking that they will die or something. \n\nI know I sound so silly but I just can\u2019t help it",

It may be that you just fear the loss. moving out is a mini-loss, in a way. You are surrendering the daily experience of living with your family. Maybe that prospect reminds you that you will (likely) outlive your mom someday.\n\nIt can take some effort to come to terms with mortality in people we love, let alone in ourselves. you've had a big dose of this recently, though. That won't make it easier. Getting help is probably the best choice.",

In the meantime I would look in to therapy as it is understandable for you to want to be close to family after what you have all been through but your feelings that your family are going to die sound very uncomfortable and I think you need to seek support for this. Even one of those events is very hard emotionally, so to be dealing with all of that must be very tough. You have a lot going on in your family life at the moment, moving itself is stressful as is navigating living with a partner for the first time.  \n\nI would be brutally honest with your girlfriend and put an end to this at the moment. Hopefully in time you can get therapy / other support and you will feel in a better position to do this which will give it the best chance. If she is a good partner she will understand that it is a not right now rather than a never at all. All the best.",

            "body": "OP, I think it's high time that you moved out of your family home and in with your GF, precisely BECAUSE you are so reluctant to do so.  It's time for you to spread your wings and fly away from the nest, especially if that idea terrifies you!  That's the only way to learn that you are much stronger and more capable than you think you are.  Your family isn't going to die because you left home, and it's not like you're planning to move to another country.  You can still stay in close touch with everyone, and talk to them as often as you wish. \n\nMoving out is a major milestone in the process of becoming an independent adult.  Unfortunately I have seen what happens when people your age never quite manage to escape the gravitational pull of their home planet - and the results are not pretty.  I get that it's painful and difficult to think about leaving your comfort zone, especially while you are still mourning the loss of close friends and relatives. But you are not doing yourself, your GF, or your birth family any favors by staying at home and remaining overly attached to Mama. \n\nTherapy is an excellent idea for addressing your irrational fears around death, which after all is something that will come for all of us sooner or later.  But you shouldn't wait for therapy to take advantage of the great opportunity you have RIGHT NOW to move out and live independently with your GF.  Stay strong, OP - you got this!",
