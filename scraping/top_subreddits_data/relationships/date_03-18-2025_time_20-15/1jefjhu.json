    "selftext": "Saw someone's post yesterday about navigating life with a partner who has fibromyalgia and felt inspired to post here! I'm hoping y'all can give me some solid advice.\n\nI (26F) have been with my boyfriend (30M) for a little under two years. In the time we've been together his chronic pain (which isn't connected to any particular/known condition as he refuses to go to the doctor) has gotten worse and worse. It's reached a point where he's almost incapable of doing chores or house projects, is usually too exhausted/in pain to make or agree to plans and getting him to do anything outside of the house together is like pulling teeth. His objections always revolve around his pain and fatigue. I've never suffered from chronic pain (and thank god), so I'm not one to judge or accuse someone of \"making it up\" since the pain itself is invisible and my boyfriend looks perfectly healthy, but he's now been unemployed for about 4 months and I'm starting to question things.\n\nI'm starting to feel doubtful for a number of reasons, and the main ones are that a) he never turns down his friend's invitations to hang out, even when the activity is something physically intense like kayaking, or going hiking, or going to a music festival and b) he is never too tired/in too much pain to have sex. Over time it's almost made it seem like he's conveniently in an unbearable amount of pain when he has to do something he isn't all that interested in (i.e. chores) and I'm starting to feel hurt that he just...doesn't seem to want to hang out with me outside of what we do lazing around the house?\n\nI've never accused him of faking or exaggerating his pain, but I have tried to talk to him about doing more fun stuff together, and it always circles back to his pain or him accusing me of trying to keep him from spending time with his friends (which I'm not trying to do by any means). I've done a ton of research into autoimmune disorders and other conditions that could be causing his problem, always bringing my findings and suggestions to him, but he just doesn't believe a doctor or any traditional medicine will help him. I'm also bothered because when we go to family outings or parties that we're both invited to (it's rare, but it does happen), he will talk anyone who will listen's ear off about how bad his chronic pain is and how frustrating it is to not be able to find a solution. The thing is, he's not actually looking for a solution. He just smokes weed every day and calls that good enough while lamenting and complaining that his body is the way that it is. He also refuses to return to work because of his pain. (For additional context: he seems to have really extreme muscle spasms/tightness, particularly in his back). I'm happy to support him through hard times, but the fact that he won't work is getting concerning and I feel severely stuck. I'm not interested in supporting him financially on a long-standing basis, but at the moment I partially am by covering some of his expenses.\n\nIf this post makes me a total asshole for questioning the degree of my boyfriend's chronic pain, so be it. I just need help and answers.\n\nSo, here are my question(s): Where do I go from here? Do you think it's possible that my boyfriend is using his pain as a crutch? Should I put some kind of ultimatum in place that will get him medical care/attention? Your advice is appreciated!\n\nTLDR: My (26F) boyfriend's (30M) chronic pain is highly questionable and I'm not sure how I can motivate him to get better. I'm worried I may just be getting taken advantage of at this point.",

But it kinda just sounds like he's slowly made you into his bang maid. \n\nEither he's faking it so he doesn't have to work or do any chores, or he has no interest in improving his situation, which isn't sustainable if the person isn't going to pursue medical help or disability benefits.",

The Somatics book is on Spotify premium too. \n\nIt may be worth tracking your water intake. My doc has recommended 90 oz per day with 30oz being electrolyte heavy. We don't process water like other people, you may be dehydrated. Also, compression socks help me soooo much on bad days! \n\nJust wanted to chip in and share :) best of luck!",

I'm sure all pain is different so I don't want to make any comments about if it is or isn't real (though I will say that lots of physically demanding activities are just totally out of my ability ATM so... I do feel that's at least a bit suspicious). However, I have been to the doctor/physios/masseuses etc etc and probably done every test in the book over the last 10 years to figure out what's happening. i haven't got good solutions from doctors, but I also haven't just given up and I do my best (it's not always easy but I try) to make lifestyle changes to help me get better. \n\nThat being said, I also know that I can't do everything and sometimes I have to make hard decisions about where I commit. Being an adult with responsibilities, sometimes that does mean that I prioritize work or chores over socialising. Sometimes it means that I accept that my house isn't perfect but I got to do something that made me happy.\n\nIt does really suck. I wish I could just not be in pain, but it's not that easy. However (and again assuming your bf is telling the truth), what absolutely isn't ok is they are unwilling to do *anything* to change this situation and putting all the domestic and financial labour on you. Like, who is paying for his music festivals and other socialisation if he's not working? You? And I guess also without any formal diagnosis they don't even qualify for any type of disability benefit. \n\nI would be worried about staying in this relationship. If you were going to give an ultimatum I would start with going to the doctor or you're going.",

So I've got perspective here.  \n  \nI hate to say it, but this does sound like it's in the realm of faking and/or maladption. This was the breaking point for me with a friend of mine -- her pain or symptom whatever was so bad....unless she wanted to do something. Her 'good days' all magically fell on the days that she had something fun planned.  Whenever it was hard stuff; suddenly she was much, much more disabled.  She could go over to clean a friend's house for Internet Points, but her own room was a pig sty of uncleaned catboxes. She would drive for 5 hours to see a concert, but be 'too exhausted' to drive to work. I do genuinely believe she had issues, but she either overstated them when it was convenient for her to do so, or she managed her disease in a way that maximized fun but crapped on her support network consistently.\n\nIn the end, the truth didn't matter that much. What mattered is that she constantly dumped on other people or leeched on other people. She didn't self-regulate or even try. She left a wake of people who felt used up. Her behavior was pretty consistent with addiction, in retrospect. Anything that got dopamine going was prioritized to a crazy degree. And I think your boyfriend sounds similar.\n\nAnd I'm not saying I think sickies should only use their energy on chores -- god no. They should go kayaking, they should go to a concert. But they should also carry some of their own weight. 50% maybe should go to fun, and 50% should go towards steering the ship as it were.",

It really sounds like he is lying. That's all I can think of atm to know for sure. Also, I would absolutely sit him down and tell him that if he doesn't see a Dr about his condition that you're leaving. Who tf wants to take care of someone physically and financially all the time just because the person doesn't want to see a dr? Any sane person with a legitimate problem would see a Dr and probably 15 to try and get a diagnosis. He's lying to you imo.

I think it is important to approach the situation like he's telling the truth because it will be easier to convince him of solutions.\n\nImo, he needs to see a doctor. If he's hurt bad enough the state might be able to help him, but it will take a while. He needs to get this problem worked on. Ideally this will relieve some of the financial burden on you. That would be the approach I'd have to the doctor conversation, tell him it's hard for you to pay for everything and if he does this it will help you. You could also tell him how hard it is to see him like this and you'd like to know what's happening to make yourself feel better.\n\nWhen I was really bad I had to aim for small victorys. Today I will make myself some food, I'll study a language, something that allows me to move forward even if it's small. By doing this I eventually learned to be more functional regardless of the pain. It could be worth asking him to do little things every day that eventually lead to him being more productive.\n\nI have two chronic pain issues, with one making it more difficult to walk and stand. Interestingly, I almost never notice I can't walk much. I do chores based around my inability to walk. I clean the toilet, do dishes on a stool, fix mechanical problems, and stretching which allows me to walk enough to do shopping. I actually take on more and grosser chores than my partner; which makes me feel good. She does all the standing chores like sweeping, vacuuming, putting clothes away after I wash them, etc. maybe there's a way to find him chores that he can do and I bet it will make him feel better. I'd hate to see my gf having to struggle to keep me well again.\n\nMy second issue is nonstop migraines which were very difficult to work through. \n\nWhile I was at my worst I still made time for my friends. They are an important support system like a partner. It's definitely weird for him to be doing physical stuff with them. I was always capable of bike riding because my leg pain was impact related so maybe something like this is going on. I typically just hung out with my friends online.\n\nFunnily about my legs, doctors have no idea why they are like this. We tried to solve it for years but it is just a mystery. It's okay because we are pretty sure it is not going to kill me and I have ways of mitigating it. It was really bad when it first happened. I lost a lot of weight and I was around 110 lbs because I couldn't get myself food. Now I forget I have leg issues unless they stop me from doing a project. My gf sometimes trys to figure it out but I tell her no one knows. My doctors aren't trying to solve it because they don't want to X-ray me and cause potential problems if it's not getting worse.",

Imo once you're in ultimatum territory it's on the downhill. But if you want to confront him and try, I hope it works. \n\nChronic illness can look different on everyone. For me personally, I struggle with fatigue and pain levels daily. While neither one of these things is visible or measurable, here are some ways they manifest in my life - \n\nI do my best to adhere to the things I know will help/I can reasonably do while exhausted. I always go on a walk, even if it's a short one. Ideally I walk multiple times per day. I usually spend a few hours throughout the day lying on a heated blanket. I prioritize drinking water. Sometimes I need to break out the compression socks or tens unit. I often smell like minty vapor rub bc of the topical pain relief /muscle relaxer gell I use. Very occasionally I'll reach for pain pills (trying my best not to get addicted). I go to physical therapy twice a week, tai chi once a week, and acupressure once a week. At PT I also do dry needling and electro acupuncture. I try to never sit at my desk chair for more than an hour, I'm consistently switching up my positions. All these are the lowest tier rung of daily or weekly things I do in order to manage my chronic illnesses. \n\nIn an ideal world I'd eat a low histamine, no processed diet. I'd meditate every day, swim multiple times a week, and I'd do my PT routine at home. I'd also get to bed by 9pm so I could reasonably be up by 6am to spend the first hour of my day slowly waking up with a book (instead of violently ripping myself out of unconscious via my phone at full volume/doom scrolling). The reality is I eat whatever I can make quickly, I only do my pt at  the clinic, I never meditate unless I'm in a really bad headspace, etc. I'm working on it lol! \n\nI spend a lot of time laying down. And a lot of time feeling guilty that I'm not healthy. I'm not able to do a lot of the fun things I want to do, I often only have enough energy to keep my life going. \n\nI always hit my out of pocket max bc I'm constantly going to different doctors. I usually go to at least one specialist appointment every month, sometimes it's closer to once a week. This week I have an MRI, a nerve conduction test, and a blood panel. I'm constantly putting myself through uncomfortable or sometimes painful testing to try and find answers. I'm trying different supplements, different diets, different meds, trying to find anything that will help me live a normal life. I'd trade almost anything for it. \n\nI have a full time job (thank God a remote one). I worked in an office for almost a decade and retail before that. My fatigue would get so bad I'd just sit in my car and cry after work. Sometimes I'd have to pull over in hotel parking lots and sleep because I knew falling asleep at the wheel was a possibility. It sucked a**. \n\nMy husband and I have domestic chores split in a way that feels fair to us. He does all the dishes and all the laundry (every day activities that I wouldn't be able to keep up with when I'm in a flare), and I do all the cooking and finances. I usually do the grocery shopping and cook fresh food every few days, I pack his lunches and I make sure we have balanced meals. On days where I can't, I'll grab us a take and bake pizza or something. Regardless we always have food in the fridge. For our finances I categorize every dollar we spend and reconcile our budget every month. I also make sure we're on track with all our retirement accounts, I balance our checking/savings every month and I move money into CDs or HYS as needed. I also make extra payments on our mortgage if we have a good month. \n\nWe both sweep, both clean bathrooms, he usually vacuums. I decorate for holidays. You get the picture! We both put effort into our shared life. \n\nAlso, I'm just as likely to not be able to make a date as I am a friend hang out due to illness stuff. I never really thought about it, but I probably go on more dates than friend events. Mostly bc if I'm feeling to sick to do something we planned as a couple, we shift plans later on in the day/week. With friend hangs I encourage the group to hang out without me since it's so hard to get everyone's schedules aligned. I hate missing stuff, but sometimes I just can't make it. \n\nPersonally I think he's lying. But he may be telling the truth! Regardless he isn't putting effort into y'all's shared life.",

            "body": "He could very well be making it up. One thing you should ask  yourself... if he isn't making it up, is this a situation you can live with?\n\nI will share a situation from my past in case it helps you at all.\n\nMy ex-husband had what seemed to be chronic pain. He would hurt all over, back pain, and his back would go out to the point he couldn't breathe (really, it was a rib slipping out of place). He would only be able to walk and walk until he \"went numb,\" and then he could rest. He didn't want to go to doctors because they never helped him, and he also refused to pay for insurance. I am fairly certain he has undiagnosed ADHD as he wouldn't do chores either. He would promise he would help, but never would.\n\nHe also had a temper. He was cranky all the time. I felt like I had to walk on eggshells to keep from upsetting him. It wasn't like that at first, but it got worse over time. He was exhausted all the time and would sleep 12 hours every night if he had the chance. He would hold down a job, but he never advanced very far. He also didn't have much body hair... no chest hair, and he only a goatee naturally (this is relavant). He had a lower libido than me but was almost always down for sex if I initiated. He just wouldn't initiate himself and had trouble finishing sometimes. He would also get angry if I didn't initiate often enough because he claimed he didn't feel desired (neither did I, but that's another issue). He also frequently had gut issues/diarrhea that made him feel icky.\n\nOver time, I realized he may have low testosterone. The lack of body hair, the fatigue, the anger issues, the lower libido, and potentially his body hurting as well. He didn't have any issues with ED... but I figured maybe his long refractory period fit in with that. He got angry when I suggested it. He said testosterone would make him angrier, like 'roid rage,' and it wouldn't help anything. He was also offended. I even suggested he had a lower libido. For 8 years, I gently suggested he just get it checked. He refused. Eventually, his brother got checked, and his was low. He told my ex to get checked for low T as it was likely hereditary. My ex listened to his brother and got checked... finally. He DID have very low testosterone. \n \nOnce he started his testosterone shots, his attitude improved significantly, he had much more energy, and he hurt less. Things improved some. They said that testosterone wouldn't cause joint and body pain, but he said anectotally that he felt better on testosterone.\n\nLater on, after we divorced (we had a lot of other issues), he was diagnosed as diabetic. When he started diabetic medication, his gut issues cleared up. He felt even better, and his joint and body pain mostly went away. He said that his chronic pain was a combination of low testosterone and diabetes/pre-diabetes. He needs to eat a low sugar diet and take testosterone shots, or he feels awful and isn't capable of doing anything that doesn't bring him dopamine. The dopamine rush is needed for his ADHD. He won't admit that. I have ADHD and so does our daughter. I see the signs in him and his executive disfunction. He isn't able to do a lot of the day to day chores he needs to. Now that I'm not around, he wants to do better, but he says he just \"can't make\" himself do it. That is executive disfunction in a nutshell.  However, fun things that give him dopamine, he can do those as his brain craves the dopamine. It is the nature of ADHD.\n\nI can't speak for your BF or his issues. But my ex-husband was very similar. I will admit i thought he was exaggerating for a long time. I was with him for 17 years before we finally divorced. In the end, him refusing to get things taken care of early on killed my love for him. I didn't feel safe in the relationship. He was verbally abusive if I didn't meet his expectations. Your situation may not be so bad. But don't feel like you have to stay to \"take care of\" him. He will figure it out, or he won't.",

If he\u2019s genuinely unable to work he can get benefits/help from the government. \n\nI\u2019d explain to him that you aren\u2019t invalidating how he feels or that he\u2019s sick, but he needs help or treatment because it affects you as well. Your partner\u2019s, you should lift each other up. In terms of financial, ask whether he\u2019s looked into alternatives, and say that you can\u2019t keep paying for everything.",
