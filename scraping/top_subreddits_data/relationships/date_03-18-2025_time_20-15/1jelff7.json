    "selftext": "My 20f boyfriend 24m doesn\u2019t want to meet my grandparents, I\u2019m fine with that. The reason he doesn\u2019t want to is because he doesn\u2019t want to, and that is the only reason. The problem is every time they want to meet up I have to be the one making up excuses and feeling like an asshole. I want to just tell the truth because I hate lying and being always stressed getting caught it a lie. But he doesn\u2019t want me to outright tell them he doesn\u2019t want to meet and to just keep making excuses. Any suggestions on how to handle this without people\u2019s feelings being hurt and not have to force my boyfriend into a situation. We have been together for 2 years\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\n  \nboyfriend doesn\u2019t want to meet family, I don\u2019t want to lie and make up excuses to avoid them for him",
