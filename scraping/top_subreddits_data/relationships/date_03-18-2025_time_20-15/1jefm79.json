    "selftext": "tl;dr i make all the decisions and im tired\n\nprobably deleting this asap bc i don\u2019t like to complain but i need to vent\n\ni (m20) and my bf (m21) have been together for two years and living together for the past 7 months.\n\ni want to preface with the fact that i knew this was a trait he had. i knew he was very indecisive and prefers to just \u201cgo with the flow\u201d of whatever someone else wants.\n\nlately it feels like i make all of the decisions. what we\u2019re having for dinner. where we\u2019re going. what route we take. sometimes his choices are dependent on mine as well, like if i don\u2019t want x food he won\u2019t get it either, or if he\u2019s out doing something and deciding between two choices, and i am involved in any way, the decision will be pawned off to me.\n\notherwise, we are great. i just feel exhausted by all the decisions, as someone who can be quite indecisive myself at times. is this valid? how do i talk to him abt it? what do i do?",

It's like having a kid, but what you want is an equal partner. \n\nHe may think he's being easygoing and undemanding, even doing you a favor by going with the flow and being accepting of what you'd like to do. So approach it by expressing how tiring it is to have to do all the mental labor of planning and deciding. And then ask him to start small, maybe by taking ownership of planning one date night or something.",
