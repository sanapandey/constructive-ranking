    "selftext": "Clarification in the title: 'parents' refers to his dad (54M) and step-mum (54F) who have been together around a decade. His mum lives elsewhere, doesn't talk to them and doesn't think we are in an abusive relationship.\n\nThis is going to be a very long post so tl;dr will be at the bottom.\n\nMy boyfriend (19M) and I (19F) have been together since December 2023. He has a large family who are all fairly close, except for their stepmum who most of the siblings dislike but my bf specifically dislikes.\n\nSince September I have been at university, which means our relationship has been strained as with all long distance relationships would be, but it is by no means abusive. We live about 2 hours apart now, compared to us being so close in the summer we practically saw each other everyday. Because of this, we have got into arguments about god knows what fairly often (we video call every night). This is exacerbated by the fact that we are both struggling mentally. Despite this, we are very happy with each other, he is my best friend and I couldn't imagine life without him.\n\nThe other day his step-mum overheard a particularly heated argument we were having. He was shouting at me over the phone (we were shouting at each other). He was not insulting, berating or belittling. Just pure frustration and miscommunication. A while later she called me to tell me that that sort of behaviour towards me is unacceptable, that it will escalate and hinted that I should leave (\"you should have a long think if that's what you want to put up with\"). While I agree with her that we shouldn't be shouting at each other and I assured her that it won't escalate, my words seem to unaffect her opinion of my bf. His dad also called me to discuss it, basically saying the same things.\n\nWhile I appreciate the concern and I really don't mind the intrusion because I know they're only trying to help, I am not in an abusive situation. He is not an aggressive person, has never hit me or threatened me. Me and my bf have talked about our recent challenges, we are both not happy about it and we have both taken each others communication and made changes on our behaviour. We are both neurodivergent (he is diagnosed, I am trying to be) so communication has always important to us. He is an amazing boyfriend, is so kind and always there for me.\n\nOne of my concerns is that they seem to think he is controlling and has made comments on me always having to be by his side, and have talked about the fact that we are always together (he often stays with me in uni for days at a time, and I go home on the weekends quite often). He has never stopped me from talking to anyone, never told me to not go anywhere, never stopped me from going clubbing or out to see friends at the pub, never told me what to wear, etc. They are under the impression he is and I don't know why or how to prevent them from thinking that. Maybe it's because I am a very quiet person and pretty much go where he goes in his house? However at family functions I am not always with him as I like all of his siblings and family friends and I do try socialise.\n\nI am really convinced that his stepmum is escalating the situation unnecessarily; she has never seemed to like me or my bf much and has never made an effort to have a connection with me except this phone call, which was to basically tell me that her stepson isn't a good bf. She's never been accepting of me staying over despite my bf's brother's gf basically living there last year- something which I didn't bother arguing with because I don't want problems, and it is her house. Another time I wanted to take a shower at their house after the gym and she was angry at my bf, saying it was embarrassing (?) and that it's the only time I'm ever allowed to do that. She is generally welcoming but there is always something small that she does that irks us but isn't worth putting up a fight about.\n\nHis dad's negative perception of him is so devastating to my bf's self esteem and general happiness, especially because he looks up to him a lot. His family are very very progressive politically and are big feminists despite it being a household of 6 boys and 1 girl. I know that for my bf, being perceived and treated as an abuser or as controlling is his worst nightmare, he hates anyone who is like that.\n\nI hope anyone has any similar experience or advice on how to deal with this? This is a truly horrible situation and we feel as though we are going crazy. His family is very family-orientated and very big, and he is at risk at being ostracised by almost everyone he loves because of this.\n\ntl;dr Me and my bf had a heated argument on the phone which his stepmum overheard and is now convinced that he is abusive and is urging me to get out before it escalates. He does not abuse me and I do not want out.",
