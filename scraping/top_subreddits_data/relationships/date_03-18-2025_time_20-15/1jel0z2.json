    "selftext": "My (30M) fianc\u00e9 (30F) and I live in northern California and have done so together since we became engaged in August 2024. We've been together for almost 2\u00bd years.\n\nThrough 2023 and early 2024 my fianc\u00e8 was suffering with mental health issues during which time she was working in social care. Early on she would end up taking sporadic days off for her mental health, but these grew into a week or 2 weeks, and eventually a 2-3 month leave granted by her doctor. I was totally fine with all this because I get its important to look after you mental wellbeing, but when she returned she couldn't string consecutive days together without calling out or leaving early and the care facilty she worked at eventually just let her go.\n\nSince being let go she's basically shut down in terms of working and it's put us under serious financial strain. My paycheck covers around 75% of our bills and I've so far been making up the gap with savings I had from before the relationship. But as the month go by those savings reserves have shrunk and shrunk.\n\nI could stomach it perhaps a bit longer if there were signs of positive change but, if anything, since November (election) its gotten worse as she's stopped trying completely and just sits at home sleeping (during the day), smoking weed, drinking wine and/or playing video games or watching TV.\n\nIf the current situation continues I'm going to have to start borrowing just to cover our expenses which I'm very reluctant to do with no end in sight. What options do I/we have to resolve the current predicament?\n\nTL;DR - I can't afford to pay all our bills and my fianc\u00e8 doesn't seem to want to seek work. What options do I/we have?",

If she\u2019s not working she should qualify for medi-cal and can receive services to help her address what sounds like major depressive disorder. I would also see if she qualifies for any income assistance since she has had a doctors note before to be on leave of absence.",

If she\u2019s drinking and smoking instead of being on medication that could mess up a disability claim. \nIf she is unwilling to seek proper MH care then you are left with the choice of either accepting that this is how it will be, or needing to end the relationship. I\u2019m sorry you are going through this.",

I can only imagine how hard it must be to have 80m+ people cast a vote against your own bodily autonomy. It must be traumatizing.  And that\u2019s only a part of the big societal step backwards she\u2019s likely processing. \n\nYes, the financial situation will be difficult as a result. Are there areas you can reduce expenses? Is it possible to find supplemental income temporarily?  Is moving an option?  Don\u2019t give up on her, and don\u2019t let money put a wedge between you.",
