    "selftext": "Tldr: I, European 26, f doesn\u2019t want ro relocate to India with my husband Punjabi 29, m due to cultural differences and lifestyle changes being too much for me to handle. \n\nMy husband is a Punjabi and I am a European NZ. We have been married for three years and he has been living in New Zealand for 10 years. I have been to India many times for three months at a time each go. \n\nMy husband has decided he wants to relocate us to India permanently, I really don\u2019t want to. I would never force him to distance himself from his roots but I honestly don\u2019t think I could cope with India for atleast 6 - 8 months a year, he said we could visit NZ yearly apparently. I made a compromise with him that I visit India for three months  a year and he can stay 6-8 months a year. He says life in India would be better for us because we would have more money and he has more connections in business there etc. My husband didn\u2019t agree to this and said where ever and whatever the husband says the wife should follow. He said he Weill buy me a car in India and I can get a job teaching English to pre schoolers. I can only speak the basics on Punjabi and no one in Punjab but his parents and a few of his relatives who don\u2019t speak English anyway. \n\nI am really conflicted and cry about this often because I feel like I\u2019m going to be giving up my freedom and individuality. \n\nThe times I have stayed in India have been hard at some points as my husbands house is rural and I can\u2019t leave or go anywhere without him. I don\u2019t get to wear what I like and to be honest if I say I don\u2019t want to eat or drink something that is culturally Punjabi I found his family judged me so much. His parents also told me to stop watching English tv shows in the house. I followed their instructions and turned it off but felt super sad after wards. \n\nI think that maybe I am being selfish for not wanting to live in India but I don\u2019t want to be trapped with no where to go. I think I will go mad. Any insight on my situation would be appreciated. Sorry my paragraphs and words are all over the place, my thoughts in my head and just a mess at the moment. ",

No support system, a dominating husband, inlaws who judge you and don\u2019t let you watch TV? This is terrible even by Indian standards. Don\u2019t go. No man is worth the mental and who even knows, physical torture. If you leave him you\u2019ll be sad for a while then move on. If you go with him that whole thing is going to include a lot of extra years of suffering. \n\nPlease don\u2019t go. I\u2019m very worried for your safety and mental health if you follow this man to a place where you have no support whatsoever.",

I've worked with a ton of them who will seem totally nice and normal and then 3 years into knowing them they'll drop literally the most insanely sexist opinion you've heard this century (usually when butting heads). Not to mention I notice the most changes in their behavior going from blonde to brunette and back - there is some truly wild fetishizing that goes on. I had someone I thought was a friend say my hair was \"too dark now\" and completely revealed he thought he was angling to date me at some point and was mad I \"ruined\" my hair. Of course he was over ten years older than me and also insanely ugly with terrible hair himself, no wonder he was trying to go the \"trick women into thinking he's safe\" route.\n\nOn the flip side Indian women who have tried to distance themselves from that have been my smartest and most badass coworkers and friends. But it's just not worth it to me to even risk friendship with Indian men anymore. Especially when I make the mistake of being blonde in public and wanting to be open minded and friendly \ud83d\ude44",

We have done China and now we are in Malaysia. China was terrible\u2014 but in its terrible-ness brought us together. Our daughters were born in China. Malaysia is a VERY welcome relief from China, we can road trip to his family in Thailand\u2026 win win all around. Now, ten years later, I will happily move to Thailand when we save a bit more money.

I got my Residence permit a year ago to get out of the country I am living in currently, but\u2026 my wife does not want to immigrate for her reasons.\n\nYes she\u2019s trying to compromise and make me fulfill my dream of getting a strong passport. But as a husband, I will not be happy if she\u2019s not completely in with my idea.\n\nYour husband would not have had met you if he did not believe that your country (New Zeland) is better than his country (India) and decided to stay in his country (India). But, I am sorry to say, that some immigrants still view their people to be better than the country he immigrated to (and I am telling you this as an immigrant - and this is what\u2019s corrupting western society, its a one way valve of cultural movement.\n\nExample: If I ever go to NZ, and someone there tried to tell me how should I act or what should I watch, I will be pissed off (and thats me as an immigrant). So you going back to his home country and being judged is not acceptable.\n\nBut to continue: I know its better for my wife to immigrate with me (she\u2019s currently jobless) and she can get a better job and a better education in the westren country where we got our resident permits. But she does not see that. My luck to marry the only refugee on earth who does not want to immigrate. I am not manipulative: I married her here, she values her family and the country she was born in (although she\u2019s never given citizenship) so I decided to find a middle ground <- and this what a life partner does.\n\nWe sat and discussed that our families are at an old age (they wont stay there forever). So why would we stay where we are\u2026 and the decision was: to live in a country that is best for our children.\n\nWe made a list of countries where we could live in (me having the ability to get up in my career path by job hopping) and she being near her family and the children being raised in countries of our same faith and moral principles. \n\nSo we found a middle ground for all of us to grow (I know I will regret not moving to Europe) but I will not drag my wife and cause her unhappiness even though I know many other ladies would wish to be in her shoes, and even though I know she could fullfill her potential - she rejecting that is her decision, not mine, and is never mine to decide what\u2019s best for her.\n\nHope it was useful",
