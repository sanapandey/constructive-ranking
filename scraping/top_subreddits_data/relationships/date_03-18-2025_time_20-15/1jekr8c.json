    "selftext": "I (F24) have been with my fianc\u00e9 (M29) for 4 years, living together for the whole time and just the two of us for the past 2 years. We got engaged last year, and things are generally great \u2014 except for tidiness and communication issues that are starting to strain our relationship.\n\nMy partner is naturally tidier than me, and I often leave small messes without realising, like putting something on the bin instead of pushing it in, forgetting about washing in the washing machine, leaving clean washing out too long, leaving paint or makeup out etc. I genuinely don\u2019t notice some of the mess, and my standard for \u2018tidy\u2019 is lower than his \u2014 but I desperately want to change because I know it bothers him.\n\nWe don\u2019t have a rota because he doesn\u2019t want to commit to specific tasks, and since I was working from home (and then unemployed), I handled most of the housework. Now that I\u2019m a week into full-time work, it\u2019s become more of an issue with balancing new responsibilities. We've had many conversations where he has expressed that I am too messy, and I feel like a fool because none of the methods (apps/schedules/cleaning buddies etc) seem to stick, and I always miss things or forget tasks and it must look like I'm not even trying.\n\nTonight we had an issue. We both had days off of work, and I came home from seeing a friend at around 4pm. He was visibly angry and very quiet but refused to talk about it. I left it an hour, asked again what was going on, and he said that 'life' was the problem. Confused and increasingly concerned, I asked what part of life and if it is something I had done, to which he replied 'to be honest I am sick of going in circles with you, so I don't want to talk about it'. I began to get very anxious, and I got emotional fearing a breakup, but he said that wasn\u2019t the case and refused to look at me. I cooked dinner, made him coffee, we watched a movie, and after 7 hours, I asked again. Then, he admitted it was the mess \u2014 I had left a fallen razor in the bathtub, cake crumbs on the floor, my shoes in front of the front door, plus 'other bits and bobs not put away and tidied'.\n\nI\u2019ve told him before that the \u2018silent treatment\u2019 makes me incredibly anxious and I need him to tell me when he\u2019s upset rather than making me guess. But he shuts down and says that\u2019s \u2018just the way he is.\u2019 It took 7 hours tonight for him to finally put me out of my misery and let me know what I had done wrong. I find it terribly hard not to get upset or frustrated when he hints at being angry, then denies it, then says he won't say why he's angry. I've tried to ignore it, but I just spiral and search for anything in my memories or in the house that may be angering him.\n\nI\u2019m worried about the growing resentment and really want to fix this. How can I stop being so messy when I don\u2019t seem to notice the mess? And how can I improve communication with my partner when he tends to bottle things up? Or if I can't improve communication, how can I be less stressed when this happens again? I have a stupid knack for assuming he's going to leave me every time he is upset, so even advice on how to stop this would be great!\n\nTL;DR: I struggle with tidiness and don\u2019t always notice the mess I leave, which is frustrating my fianc\u00e9. Tonight he gave me the silent treatment. I\u2019ve asked him to communicate more directly when he\u2019s upset, but he tends to shut down. How can I get better at tidying and improve communication with him?\n ",

Honestly what he's doing is a form of emotional abuse. \n\nYeah, it sucks that you're a little messy, and you should work on it, but my god acting like a toddler and pouting for hours and not communicating is a HUGE red flag.",

I'd be lying if I said that him sharing his feelings have never ended in a bicker, but I'd always much rather a fight than an evening like this!",
