    "selftext": "My (26F) husband (27M) plans to give me an ultimatum. The other day I woke up after a nap and heard him on the phone (on speaker) with his mother and since he didn\u2019t notice I was awake I listened for a while. A little backstory, We are moving in with friends while he finishes his schooling, they agreed to a lower rent than we have now so we can save money to leave when he is finished. The friends happen to be near where my family lives. My family moved away about 4 years ago (around the same time we got engaged) and we\u2019ve stayed near his family until now.\nWe\u2019ve talked about where we want to go when we move out after he finished school and he suggested a state but I also suggested staying near my family. We never really agreed on a state after that conversation since we don\u2019t know if we will like the state our friends live in that we\u2019re about to move to. \nGetting back to the phone call, I heard him say that once he\u2019s finished I\u2019m going to have to choose between him and my family because he\u2019s not staying in that state. His mom said that she\u2019ll be coming and staying every chance she gets if she feels welcome or not. \nI\u2019m not sure how to take this and we\u2019ve been together for 6 years, I shouldn\u2019t be the only one to compromise and move to a state I don\u2019t want to right? \n\nTLDR: My husband told his mom I\u2019ll have to choose between him and family.

His mom said that she\u2019ll be coming and staying every chance she gets if she feels welcome or not.\n\nWhy does his Mom not feel welcome?\n\nWhy the fixation on your family when they moved away 4 years ago?\n\nHis mother isn't demanding that he stay near her, but seems to be assuring him that wherever he chooses to live,  she will within her power visit as often as she can.  They don't seem the usual enmeshed per OP's comment that the mother only lives 25 minutes away from them now, and does not insert herself into their lives.\n\nWhat I do find disturbing is that your hubby is telling his mother about the planned ultimatum.  I could see him talking about his being conflicted about staying in the state.  His mother should have told him to talk to his wife.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of missing information in this post.\n\nOP, you need to sit down with your husband and hash out a scenario that is a win-win with some minuses due to the compromise itself.\n\nWhat is the missing information that makes him feel it's him vs. your family?  Are you the one that is overly enmeshed with their family?  \n\nHis mother appears to give you both space to do your thing.  She assured her son that wherever he lands, near or far,  she will  make the effort to visit.\n\nSo, IMO,  tell him that you overheard him talking about his planned ultimatum.\n\nThen start talking to one another.\n\n* Why does he feel that it is him vs. your family?  \n  * Is his perception accurate? How can this feeling second to them be improved?\n* Seems like there is a lot of missing information or some acute lack of self awareness about your interaction with your family if he is willing to walk away from his marriage.\n* Why does his not wanting to stay near your family considered you compromising in your eyes? Do you feel that you are always the one 'sucking' it up? If so, that is a problem in an of itself.  Why isn't the current move considered a bonus for this life foundation building period of your relationship?\n* Talk about what your ideal is for a move\n  * Rural, urban, or suburb \n  * Apartment vs house\n  * Climate\n  * Travel distance via car or air plane to either parent's house\n\nI also note that you two got married very young, well before the magic 25/26 year old mark.  You may have grown into different views of the world, wanting different life experiences, and being different people than you were when you got together as baby adults. \n\nBrace yourself as this may turn out to be an overall issue of incompatibility.\n\nIMO, talk it out now so that you both get a better feel for where your marriage is headed.  It also gives you both time to do research on alternative states to move to while he finishes his schooling.\n\nMy two cents.",

So tell me what you're thinking!\"\n\nThat's how I would personally approach it. But it depends what your goal is. Is your goal to find a resolution that makes everyone happy? Or is your goal having a discussion about ultimatums and him communicating his feelings more directly? Or is the goal to discuss his relationship with his family and dynamics you find problematic? You could go into this conversation with various different objectives and they will guide which questions you ask and how you approach it. \n\nSo I would suggest thinking about what you want out of this conversation, and then choose questions that will help you achieve that. Start in a way that will not make him feel defensive, but if there's something you really don't like and want him to change, you can say that. I always suggest speaking face to face, however if it would be more effective over text based on yours or his personality, you can always consider that option",

He's told his mother he's giving you a binary choice and has not talked to you yet. There can be a difference between what Mumma's boys say to their mumma's and what they say when they talk to their partner. Wait until he presents the ultimatum to you if indeed he frames it as an ultimatum. Try to reframe it as a request and see if there are other options that would be acceptable to him.  Better option is start talking to him now.  I'd want to know why he is so against staying where your family is.\n\nThird problem. Possible overbearing MIL. Again, the statement of staying all the time, welcome or not, is not the reality. \n\nSome of this will be changed if you can have open conversations with him about living arrangements.
