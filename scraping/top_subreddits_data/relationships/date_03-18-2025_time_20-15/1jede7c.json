    "selftext": "I (33M) have been dating a girl (28F) for about 8 months now.  She's great in a lot of ways - kind, thoughtful, creative.  And we were off to a great start, and for awhile I was legitimately excited about the relationship.  But in the last couple of months, I've started to feel like this isn't right for me.  Maybe it's me, or maybe I'm just not as attracted to her as I originally thought; it could be both.  But I just don't think continuing is best for either of us.\n\nI'm worried that I'm going to hurt her by ending it though.  Her enthusiasm for the relationship is very obvious, and we've texted almost daily throughout the months.  Lately I've found myself only really trying to keep pace with her enthusiasm (both by text and in person), as opposed to interjecting my own.\n\nSome extra background: while we've dated for 8 months, and we're exclusive, we've had barely any serious conversations.  From the start, the whole thing has felt casual.  The closest thing to a serious conversation was a *very* quick chat about wanting kids early on, which lasted all of a minute.  I feel that we've just never gone into depth about ourselves, this despite me knowing a lot about her family and personal life.  In my view, this is on both of us, as neither of us has really made the move to grow closer.  And the more I think on it, the more I believe I don't want to bridge that gap.  This is a major reason why I feel I need to end this - I can't let us stay in this casual limbo forever.\n\nSo my concern here is how gently to do this, because I don't think I can avoid breaking her heart.  My plan is to do this in-person, and be upfront about all of this.  But how do I set this up during the day?  Do I just text her a few hours before that I want to talk to her?  I'm worried that will make her worry in the hours before.\n\nTl;dr I believe I am ready to end things with my partner but am trying to figure out how to minimize her hurt.",

I appreciate that, and it's nice that you care about her feelings. But like I told him, you cannot continue with a relationship based on that reason alone. Staying with someone because you don't want to hurt their feelings by breaking up is a recipe for an unhappy relationship. \n\nIt is valid to want to end a relationship for any reason or no real, tangible reason at all.  There is no super easy way to do it that will avoid hurt feelings altogether. Whether you say sweet words or hurtful words, it will probably hurt her either way, though of course to varying degrees. Just because you end it nicely doesn't mean she will not have her feelings hurt. It's better to end it than to string someone along when your heart isn't in it. Personally, I would rather someone end it with me than to just go through the motions and not actually enjoy his relationship with me. \n\nI would avoid laying blame or going into great detail if you're trying to avoid more hurt feelings though.  For instance, \"there's a lack of connection\" rather than \"you haven't been trying to connect with me and I don't feel any connection with you\". \n\nThat may help soften the blow, but there WILL be a blow either way. There's really no way around it. It's never a nice feeling to be broken up with.  Especially in a case like this when they haven't done a specific thing to upset you or break a boundary etc. All you can really do is try to be as respectful as possible and try not to \"blame\" her so that It's not more hurtful than it needs to be.",

Genuinely find out if this relationship is worth pursuing. \n\nYou don\u2019t need a reason to break up. But this doesn\u2019t sound like a rip off the band aid moment. \n\nPut in enough work to know.",

Give her space to react and talk even if it takes hours, hopefully that will bring her easy closure",

Which does not seem to be a possibility for you. Hence, I'd keep the reasoning as vague as possible. You will break her heart, and you will be the bad guy. The nicest thing you can do for her is to accept that role and not try to keep face with your breakup reasoning. Giving her as definitive of a closure as possible is most beneficial for the breakupee.\nThat is my advice to you. Good luck!",
