    "selftext": "I don\u2019t know how much information to include about our relationship that is relatable to the situation but here I go. \nMy bf (24) and I (female 23) have been together for about 3 years. We met in college (graduated now) and I don\u2019t know much about his dating history prior to me. From past social media posts I know he had a gf from high school. I\u2019ve never asked about her or heard him talk about her. I know nothing about their relationship duration or breakup either.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have a lot of female friends. Often he goes out for drinks with guy friends who are single and I worry about him talking to other girls because I don\u2019t think his friends are good influences.i  often question him about what he\u2019s doing and who he\u2019s with and he seems to be honest. Being long distance I am always worried and I tend to get myself worked up even when things are actually fine. \n\nThis past weekend I was visiting my boyfriend because we\u2019ve been doing long distance for about a year and half. I want to preface this next part by saying I have trust issues due to him cheating in the past. But, while I was at his apartment I was snooping and found 3 Polaroid pictures of his ex girlfriend and him in his bible in his nightstand. I don\u2019t think he regularly, or even at all really uses his bible. This drawer is more so filled with junk. I\u2019m wondering if I should be concerned or bring it up to him? It\u2019s been almost two weeks since and I\u2019ve been thinking about it from time to time. I only feel uneasy because of our past incident with cheating I don\u2019t really think he\u2019s secretly reminiscing on these pictures but then again I never thought he would cheat on me. \nAlso- in one of the pictures the ex is wearing a pair of his Pj pants that I now have in my possession that kind of upset me and made me feel uneasy. \n\nAny advice? (Besides to stop being so nosey) \n\nTL;DR\nDo I say anything to my boyfriend about finding pictures of him and his ex girlfriend from high school in his bible? Or do I leave the situation alone?  What would I even say as to how I found those pictures? \n\nEdit: I have NOT asked about the photos. I felt bad after finding them due to snooping. Is it weird for him to have those photos kept there? Should I ask about them? \nAnd I don\u2019t really want to end our relationship. ",

If his explanation sounds believable to you about the photos, will you be able to trust him in the future about other things? IMO once the trust is broken, it\u2019s usually better to cut our losses and move along.",

Also, I think you should stop overthinking and keep away those negative thoughts. If you can\u2019t really trust your boyfriend, then might as well end the relationship so you\u2019ll have peace of mind.",

            "body": "Look, having photos of exes in your junk draw is probably not that big a deal especially if he has just all his random stuff in there. \n\nBut I worry you really bury the lede on yourself when you focus on that sort of thing. Like this guy cheated, he has sketchy friends, it is long distance... this is all a recipe that forces you to be constantly anxious because he just isn't that trustworthy. \n\nThe question becomes whether this is really the life you want. You'll never be able to drop your guard with him again, you will always remember he cheated and likely stuff like these photos will always pop up to set you off. If he hadn't cheated in the past you'd probably have not even thought about having old photos in a Bible he doesn't use, but because you have to be on the lookout of course it sets you off. \n\nThat's more to do with him than anything and something you have to face. LDR is tiring enough, one where you can't relax will just burn you out.",
