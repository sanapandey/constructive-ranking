    "selftext": "TL;DR: I\u2019ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 5 years, but my family refuses to accept him because of cultural and religious differences. I\u2019m struggling with guilt and shame, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s wrong to choose my partner over my family\u2019s approval. How do I cope with this?\n\nPost:\nHi everyone,\nI'm a 22-year-old woman, and I've been with my boyfriend, also 22, for five years. We come from very different backgrounds \u2013 I grew up in a strict Arab Muslim household, and he\u2019s Christian and Latino. We've been in a loving relationship for a long time, and I truly see a future with him. He\u2019s been an incredible partner, and his family has welcomed me like one of their own, which has meant so much to me. We live together in an apartment in a different city now, and I\u2019m financially independent after graduating and starting my career.\n\nBut here's the thing: my parents will never accept him. My dad, in particular, is very adamant that I should marry a Muslim man, and he believes that women should only marry within our faith. The issue is that my mom always sides with him because he\u2019s verbally abusive and dramatic, and it\u2019s just easier for her to go along with what he says.\n\nI\u2019ve been keeping this relationship a secret from my parents, and lately, I\u2019ve been feeling so guilty. The love I have for my boyfriend feels like it\u2019s being overshadowed by the constant guilt and shame I feel about loving someone they would never approve of. I know I don\u2019t want to give him up, but I\u2019m struggling to navigate this pressure. I just want to love him without feeling shamed or torn between him and my family.\n\nI know I can\u2019t control my parents\u2019 beliefs, but I don\u2019t know how to stop feeling guilty for loving someone they wouldn\u2019t accept. I don\u2019t want to lose my relationship, but I also don\u2019t want to keep hiding or feeling this constant inner conflict.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation where you had to balance your relationship with family expectations, especially when your family won\u2019t accept your partner? How did you cope with the guilt or navigate these difficult cultural expectations?\n\nAnd here's the part I\u2019m struggling with the most: is choosing a partner over family wrong? Is it wrong to prioritize my own happiness and love over family approval, especially when it comes to something as personal as who I choose to spend my life with?\n\nAny advice, support, or stories would mean the world to me right now.",

Under no circumstances should you choose a partner based on family approval. It should be your choice based on how YOU actually wish to live your life. \n\n  \nNot for religious reasons, but my wife's family wasn't really accepting of me and I don't talk to them. She still has a relationship with them although it is more strained than it used to be, but she does still talk to them and sees them. It's not ideal but it is what it is. She would have driven herself crazy trying to be with someone else they would have more approved of, rather than the person she actually wanted to be with.",

            "body": "Ultimately, you have to accept that your parents' reactions are their own responsibilities. If they are going to get upset and lash out at you (or worse) because you choose to be with somebody who loves you and treats you right, then that speaks poorly of them as people. Not that they're necessarily bad people in every facet of their life, but they would rather control you than have you be happy. You've seen how your father has bullied your mother into submission over the years, and it's kinda tragic - don't let yourself be bullied into submission too.\n\nUltimately, doing this will only change your relationship with them if they choose to start treating you poorly. As you've seen with your bf's family, it's perfectly possible for a family to embrace somebody with open arms - and if your father wants to push his own daughter away instead of welcoming a new person to the family, that is his choice, and he will have to live with being more distant from you. In order to come to peace with all this, you need to accept that the only thing holding your family back from having a great parent-child relationship with you is their own choice to reject you over something that makes you very happy and barely affects them.\n\nTalking to a therapist to discuss how to approach all this would be a great idea.",

If they try to control your life, you cut them off for a couple months. And then offer to resume contact on your terms: they don\u2019t try to control your life, and you\u2019ll stay in contact with them. They try to control your life, you cut them off again for another couple of months (cut: phone, socials, message from other people, passenger pigeon).\n\n  \nand you enforce consistently. And your folks then have to decide what is more important: having any contact with you or trying to grow beat you at every opportunity.",

Considering how deeply rooted the misogyny is in Islam, women from other religions are hardly lining up to marry into that particular religion. However, if Muslim women continue to marry non-Muslims, many Muslim men won't be able to find a wife. So, put pressure on your womenfolk to \"marry within the faith\", and the crisis is averted.\n\nThat being said, I have no advice. Just this tidbit to think about. Hopefully, it makes your path clearer.",

It\u2019s your future so make the decision on what will make you happy not what someone else wants to hear. I suggest you make plans to leave to a safe place taking your key documents etc with you if you choose your relationship. Then tell your parents.
