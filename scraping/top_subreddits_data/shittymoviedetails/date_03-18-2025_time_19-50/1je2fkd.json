The internet was young and it was harder for people to spoil movies for you.\n\nEveryone thought Drew was going to be the MC.  Killing her off early really set the pace for the rest of the movie and truthfully helped relaunch Drews career.\n\n(simular to how Pulp Fiction relaunched Sam Jackson, Travolta, and Bruce Willis's careers a year or two before)",

These possible reasons include Warner Bros. \"punishing\" Seagal because of his antics on the set of On Deadly Ground, his primadonna behavior, or both. In actuality, Seagal's character (Travis) was always meant to die in the finished film. The earliest draft of the script (written in April 1991) had Travis die in the exact same way, with the only difference being that he didn't have a final line telling Grant to keep the team safe, and the team originally used the umbilical of a refueling airplane instead of a stealth jet to get onto the plane.\n\nhttps://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Trivia/ExecutiveDecision",

The terribly schlocky American Outlaws as a star-making vehicle for the Irish hunk Colin Farrell was released only 18 months before the worst filmed adaptation of Daredevil with Farrell\u2019s godawful interpretation of Bullseye. \n\nSo many *big* and great movies were released in 2002 that it almost seems impossible that the timing between those two movies was only 18 months. Raimi\u2019s Spider-Man was notably one of those 2002 movies that revitalized Daredevil\u2019s production and got its budget raised; Farrell was also in the much better Minority Report and Phone Booth in 2002. \n\nBut so much good shit came out between American Outlaws in 2001 and Daredevil in 2003 that it really does feel like a vast ocean of time between the two, not simply 18 months, which is like a blink of the eye when you\u2019re over 20. \n\nThere was also one of those silly li\u2019l space opera Star Wars movies released in 2002 that apparently made quite a bit of money; whodathunk it \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

The fact a lot of her work is legit is purely by accident in the same way that Nic Cage is considered successful.

Cruise is especially surprising, because his 2005 antics after firing his publicist that kept a lid on his crazy pissed Steven Spielberg off so much that he swore to never work with Cruise again; that\u2019s stayed true 20 years on, and he only directed Cruise twice in Minority Report and War of the Worlds. Paramount specifically blamed his 2005 meltdown on Mission: Impossible III not performing as well as expected, so they broke up with him and Paula Wagner for five years until he was unexpectedly announced to be reprising his role as Ethan Hunt in Ghost Protocol. \n\nBut the new hotness, Jeremy Renner, was being rumored as a potential successor to the face of the franchise, so it kinda made sense that Paramount would being Cruise back for one more \u201cpassing the torch\u201d movie. 14 years and almost four box office successes later, he\u2019s still Ethan Hunt and Renner had to tap out of the franchise because he was kinda tied up in another massive franchise thanks to a little indie hit released five months after Ghost Protocol: The Avengers. \n\nStill amazes me how easily both destroyed their careers for what seemed like forever, but both are still relevant in that industry, one *very* fucking much so. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\\*money and illegal coercive tactics aside, I mean, because that\u2019s already an obvious explanation.",

Tv actors were definitely viewed as lesser, and honestly the quality difference in what directors would accept from TV vs film actors was readily apparent back then. \n\nSo yeah, Friends was 2 seasons in and Cox was a main character on a fairly popular tv sitcom, but Drew Barrymore was a child movie star from a multi-generational family of actors and hollywood royalty who had been in the news and tabloids nonstop for like a decade at that point. In terms of celebrity she was by far the biggest one in the film at the time.",

I have no idea how they handled their finances over the years.  They could have pissed it away and need to pay the mortgage I suppose.\n  \nBut...Grint?  Seriously?  His initial earnings were a million dollars, BUT he also took a percentage of the movie's profits.  How the hell does going from the single largest modern time kid's movie series to playing a supporting role in some obvious shlock garbage about farting?  His parents must have been wading in media offers of all types after HP was released.  And somehow this was the best one?  After taking in literally a million dollars plus box office percentage?\n  \nOne could argue that they might have considered the potential for boosting his image seeing as how he was the...<ahem>...red headed stepchild of the HP crowd.  But holy hell.  If you want to boost a star's potential, putting them in a fart movie just doesn't seem like the best move.\n  \n*Hey, today on 'Stars Are More Important Than You' we're talking with Rupert Grint whom we all know played Ron Weasley in Harry Potter!  Hi, Rupert and welcome to the show.*\n  \n*Hi, its great to be here.*\n  \n*So Rupert, now that you've played a major role in a global box office smash, what could be next for you?  An action thriller?  Broadway?  A sequel?  Music perhaps?*\n  \n*Well funny you should ask because I've just signed on for Thunderpants.*\n  \n*...and that is...*\n  \n*A movie where I play a side character (again) in which the main actor saves the world by farting.*\n  \n...\n  \n...\n  \n*Annnnnnnnd...we'll be back after these messages!*",
