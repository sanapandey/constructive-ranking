Not really? I'd say so bc Pleakley isn't trans, he's just in drag. However, the decision to remove it definitely has something to do with the MAGA crusade against Drag Queens, which is parallel to their hatred of all trans people by reducing us to \"male predators in women's bathrooms,\" which definitely pisses me off.",
