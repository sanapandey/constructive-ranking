Ted makes them each a martini (which we do not see him finish). Jake puts Caroline in the car and gives them a 6 pack. We see Caroline drink at least two of them while Ted is driving. \n\nThis is clearly shown in the scene where he drives her to his friend's house so they can take a photo as proof he got with her. He doesn't appear drunk at all, and she is semi-conscious. So even if he got black out drink later off camera (off his 1/2 martini and up to 4 beers), he still knowingly planned on having sex with a passed out girl.",
