He's essentially saying \"no\" to experiencing someone's artistic creation the actual correct way *and* the way the creators intended it to be experienced. Watching someone play TLOU or God of War (or really most narrative driven games now) or reading about it is not enough of an experience to fully understand it or feel as fulfilled if you *were* the one playing. It's sad he's so nonchalant about saying something like that, try harder, dude. This doesn't bode well for the GoW show that's for sure",

Thus, he spent his time working to nail the material he was given by Nolan and Co. It was amazing because the showrunners and writers were amazing at matching the world and tone of the games, and Goggins is a great actor who was enabled to focus on acting \n\nIdeally, the God of War showrunners do the same. Considering both are produced by Amazon, i actually feel very good about them sticking to the formula that Fallout established where the focus on staying faithful to the game comes from the writing. \n\nTl;dr: Actors dont need to play the games, the writers and showrunners do",

Goggins' character in Fallout doesn't exist in any of the games, and that benefits him in the way that he can take some real creative liberties. But if it is someone playing a beloved character with a well defined personality that has been around for decades then people will have certain expectations on how that character should be acted.\n\nNot video game, but when Jodie Whittaker (no hate to her mind you) had never watched and was told not to watch Doctor Who at all before becoming The Doctor it did not do her portrayal of the character any favor. I'm not just blaming her, but it was very clear in her era that she was barely anything like the previous Doctors. None of the ancient wisdom, or slightly rude yet charming attitude, none of the \"look at me, I'm the most important person in the room and everyone needs to shut up and listen to me\" moments. Her character did have the positive attitude and the charisma to some extent, but to many it didn't even feel like the same character.\n\nAll this to say, I think it depends on the circumstances tbh",

From Borderlands to Witcher, there\u2019s been some real stinkers lately. So him coming out and saying \u201cI\u2019m not a gamer, I couldn\u2019t play it\u201d just doesn\u2019t inspire confidence.

When Atreus stops listening to Kratos, you could actually feel how he was attacking and wasting cooldowns without your input: the gameplay was telling you how much he was fighting in his own, while perhaps watching it from the outside looks like a normal battle.\n\nIt's not a huge difference, but many little things can lead to a big loss in media translation.",

We\u2019d try to play co-op or 1v1 games and I would just get demolished. He finally had mercy on me and set me up with some fun single-player games, as well as limping along with me in Portal 2 co-op. It probably took me a couple months to really get the hang of it, and it was a process. For a while I had to invert the axes of the sticks because the normal movement wasn\u2019t intuitive to me. I only stopped doing that because a game I wanted to play didn\u2019t have that option, so I just brute-forced my way through it. I only did all that because I had the time and energy to spare, and I really wanted to get back into gaming. I don\u2019t blame the guy for giving up; he\u2019s a sixty-year-old man with a family and a Peabody award, I\u2019m guessing he doesn\u2019t have a ton of free time.
