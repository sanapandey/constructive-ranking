            "body": "Well that's literally what happened. Because the movie was (at least in part) based on real life media mogul William Randolph Hearst, Hearst's papers absolutely buried the movie. And since Hearst basically ran like half the American media at the time this hurt the movie's financial prospects significantly and despite its critical acclaim it ended up not being able to turn a profit and thus it faded from memory pretty soon after release. It was only over a decade later when the French discovered it that it started getting a revival. So at the time of release Citizen Kane genuinely had basically *no cultural impact* whatsoever.\n\nOh wait, right this is a shitposting sub... uh, here's the Cane from Citizen Kane:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hn5c3xfh0dpe1.jpeg?width=544&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba0e2de83e0809f477b721648596411dd0e348bf",

There's a really interesting documentary about it from the 90s called *The Battle Over Citizen Kane* if you're interested in more detail. Don't get me wrong: Kane *is* one of the most influential movies ever made (up there with stuff like Birth of a Nation, Battleship Potemkin and Breathless as far as defining the grammar of cinema) but, thanks in part to the bad press spread by Hearst's papers, the film didn't do too well at the box office and was largely forgotten after release for about a decade-ish until it was rediscovered, mostly by the French in the mid 50s, and started being reevaluated as a masterpiece.\n\nIt was actually the *next* generation of filmmakers who came of age in the 50s/early 60s who got really inspired by it, the movie brat generation types like Scorsese, Spielberg, Friedkin etc. In fact there's a great video where William Friedkin (legendary director of The Exorcist, The French Connection, Sorcerer) talks about how seeing a screening Citizen Kane in the early 60s changed his life forever and what the true meaning of the film is. However for some reason we can't post videos on this sub so here's a picture of William Friedkin instead. Just pretend he's talking about the movie and how it changed cinema - it's close enough:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sduxo000xfpe1.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f75385a07cecbbded2d4759fa51e017b2322b2a\n\nAmazing right? I mean I do like Citizen Kane a decent bit but hearing him talk about it (and Friedkin is one of my favorite directors) really puts it in perspective how life-changing seeing it back then must've been.",
