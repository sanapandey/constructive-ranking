You heavily highlight the good quality of one and you\u2019re likely making someone else in the group feel more insecure about how they\u2019re not that thing you just complimented their friend for, even if the insecurity is irrational or not even true.\n\nThis scene was depicting 2 woman bonding over something that they both value. And that almost all females in general value. \u201cFeeling\u201d beautiful.  Not being, but feeling. When girls help each other feel beautiful, it\u2019s a powerful bonding experience for many of them. Because not feeling beautiful is a great insecurity that almost all women have and/or experience at many points in their lives.\n\nBlame it on patriarchy or society or some other scapegoat all you want, but women like feeling beautiful.  It\u2019s present in just about every culture in human history. Males like looking at beautiful females, but females also just like feeling beautiful.  Almost like those 2 things complement each other. Crazy right.\n\nShe didn\u2019t change everything about herself here. She bonded with another woman who accepted her and then did one of the most common \u201cfemale rituals\u201d of dolling oneself up with another girl (common in that era at least, not sure how it is today).  Then proceeded to present herself in a different light to the others in the group who had their perspectives on her changed even more as a result.\n\nSo annoying how quick many will be to interpret things so pessimistically when there\u2019s such obvious nuance if one can get past the overly negative outlooks they endorse in themselves.",

She realized that if she kept shutting the world out, other people can never really know or care for her.\nAndrew was one of the first people who really tried to get to know her. He cared so much that when she tried to push him away like she probably did with most others, he fought to get her to let her guard down. It turned out that the jock and the invisible, antisocial girl had more in common than either would've ever considered. Their budding romance had little to do with the makeover. Their connection started much earlier on that Saturday.",

Ever guy in the groupe gets to tell their story in depth and we are meant to see things from their point of view. The girls do not get this. The weird girl's story, which she only tells the jock ( as opposed to the guys who tell their story to the whole groupe) is a measly \"my parents ignore me\" . The popular girl gets it even worse. She's sexually assaulted by the bully, and when she tries to tell her story to the groupe she doesn't even get the chance because she is repeatedly interrupted by the same guy who just sexually assaulted her. \n\nThe thing about the Breakfast Club is that we are supposed to like all the characters, but we are meant to relate and sympathise with the guys.",

I like that black shit.\u201d \n\nThat speaks to me as an actual personal preference as opposed to this idea that Allison feeling somehow coerced into playing some kind of a role. \n\nThe other part that always bothered me was that stupid bow on the side of her head. It almost feels as though Claire is presenting a literal gift to Andrew or, worse, almost as if Allison was a cute little pet who\u2019d just come back from the groomer\u2019s, \u201cnew and improved.\u201d\n\nI just didn\u2019t get a vibe that Allison felt emancipated and thusly empowered from her make-under. It felt like she was to abandon all signs of her \u201cunhealthy\u201d identity to now be \u201chealthy.\u201d The reality is, though, that neither goth nor preppy (nor any style) is objectively less pathological than any other. \n\nBy the way, \u2018purposely smells bad\u201d?

            "body": "People talk about the makeover being a horrible idea and I get that but I think the intent was that it was to make Allison feel happy. Like at the end of the movie she\u2019s still herself and nothing has changed there but the makeover was a way for her to open up to the others and for Claire to open up to her. I don\u2019t think the movie is trying to say \u2018gawd she was ugly but now she\u2019s a prep she\u2019s great!\u2019 but more showing that she\u2019s been affected by the others and has put down that defensive barrier and in turn she\u2019s affected them. Idk that\u2019s at least how I saw it. I think Andrew immediately falling in love with her at that point is pretty fucking dumb though lol",

I was a ridiculously awkward teen girl once and if a girl like Claire had given me a makeover and therefore \"accepted\" me I'd have thought that was a great thing.\n\nBut now looking at it as a ridiculously awkward middle aged woman I wish they hadn't changed how she looks but how they all see her. There needs to be room for the shy, awkward weirdos to be who they are without being perceived as just a problem to fix",

Like her big flaw in the movie is that she\u2019s spiteful and mean to others because she\u2019s the popular girl and that\u2019s what she\u2019s required to do. But on the flip side Allison is closed off, keeps people at arms length and acts out because she\u2019s lonely. The makeover is Claire\u2019s way of being nice and doing something selfless for another person while Allison is actually letting someone into her personal space and not immediately forcing them away. I don\u2019t think the movie is saying that her style is something that needs to changed but by doing so it helps both Claire to do something nice and for Allison to get the positive attention she needs. The movie implies that come Monday they\u2019ll probably never speak to each other again and things will go back to how they once were but they\u2019ll all have changed inside and understood themselves and each other a bit better.",

I just think that, because this movie was mainly targeted at teens when it came out, no teenager is analyzing the makeover scene *that* critically. Which is why there's the other (probably more common) read on it, that Alison had to change herself to really be seen by the others. \n\nIt can be read the way that you're reading it, sure, but it could've done well with some extra scenes to reinforce those ideas, or making it more overt somehow. Idk how exactly, it's been a long time since I've seen it. It's also an 80s movie and simply doesn't hold up as well to 2020s social norms",

It was simple minded filmmaking and it fit too much into the general anti-goth/punk sentiment that many parents had at the time.\n\nIt was possible to be into alternative clothing AND be friendly and sociable.

She\u2019s just the weird anti-social girl. \n\nSecondly, everyone seems to misunderstand the makeover scene. It\u2019s not about making her \u201cpretty\u201d. It\u2019s about Claire opening up and realizing that these people aren\u2019t \u201cbelow her\u201d like she previously thought, and also helping Allison open up and bond with another girl allowing her to come out of her shell. She probably doesn\u2019t have the confidence to talk to Andrew at all without Claire\u2019s help. A large part of the movie is about these people growing out of the tropes they\u2019ve boxed themselves in. \n\nStill one of my favorite movies of all time.
