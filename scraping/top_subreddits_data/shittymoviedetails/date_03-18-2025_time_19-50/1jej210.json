They weren't banned, but cinemas were, as the fear was that they'd allow for gender mixing to occur (Saudi Arabia, surprise, is almost pervertedly conservative). The first movie shown in an actual cinema after the ban was lifted was Black Panther in a private screening, but the first movie to be shown publicly in any place was The Emoji Movie, shown in a makeshift tent with a projector inside of it.",

It's like deaf people realising that farts make a noise when they gain their hearing.",
