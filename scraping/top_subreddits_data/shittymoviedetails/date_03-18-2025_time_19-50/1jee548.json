Both former employees ended up owing mid 5 figures, and it took them years to pay off.  \n  \n  I was promoted to fill one of their slots and I watched the drama unfold from the inside, including my work computer having hidden notes with more details about how they were planning to do worse before they got found out. I just pretended to never see those, tho. I figure the shit was hot enough, and I certainly hated the company enough to where I wasn't about to enable them to have even more leverage.  \n  \n  I'm not saying this will happen to you, just be careful.",
