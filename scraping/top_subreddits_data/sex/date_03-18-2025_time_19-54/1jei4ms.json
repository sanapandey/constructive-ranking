I have a large level of guilt whenever I have sexual thoughts, dreams,  or masturbate or anything like that. Its something that just makes me feel like a disgusting person for some reason, and im aware that its supposedly normal and that its our human nature but I just wish I wasnt like this lol. Its something that I feel weighs on my mental health alot and sort of hinders alot of my social relationships. I do have a therapist but bringing this up sounds so awkward and weird to me, I think partly due to her being a woman. The whole thing just makes me feel like a very gross person so I hate to imagine how talking about it would go lol. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.",

I'm sure your therapist would not find it awkward at all and you are likely not her first client dealing with this. If you don't wanna talk to her you could also find a sexual therapist. \n\nHave you thought about what this shame is rooted in for you? I think understanding it is key to overcoming it.",

This is completely natural and normal.  Animals of all species masturbate. I think society sets the tone for embarrassment or shame about this.  When in reality, everyone does it.  You\u2019re normal.  This is normal and there is nothing wrong with you masturbating.  Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself, the world is hard enough on you.  \u2764\ufe0f",

            "body": "Hello friend! Firstly, I completely understand how you feel. I was raised in a household where sex was only spoken of in a negative way. I don\u2019t know if that was your experience but know that you\u2019re not alone in feeling this way. I know that talking to your therapist sounds uncomfortable. Just know that she, as a therapist, has heard it all and that will not even phase her. \nThough I would encourage you strongly to speak to her about this (because it is hurting you,) if you still don\u2019t want to tell her then I encourage you to think about a few things:\n-Think about a person that you love and care about. If they brought this problem to you, what reassurances and encouragement would you offer to them?\n-If you are having disturbing sexually intrusive thoughts that persist, this may be OCD. You may want to address with a pro.\n\nAgain. You\u2019re not alone. You are not bad or dirty. You are just human. Everyone has those feelings because they are a feature of our biology and nothing more. \u2665\ufe0f",

It sounds like you were exposed to others who have/had very negative inhibitions regarding sex and probably the human body.  Such people are common in fundamentalist religions, especially Christian ones.\n\nTalk to your therapist. Maybe start out by explaining the difficulty you have opening up to her about this and why.  Then, you and she can work on methods to allow you more freedom of expression on these topics.",
