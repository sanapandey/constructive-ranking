Reverse cowgirl is OK. Side-lying, spoon reach-around is OK... but, again, I usually get annoyed by it and just take over, because you, yourself, get caught up in your own moment, and then it's just kind of a hand-flail that's not very precise.",

Her leg closest to you is over your hip, her other leg is between yours. You can kinda lock in and move against each other with your legs. \n\nYou're on your side, she's on her back. \n\nIt's not taxing for anyone, so you can go for a while, and it gives great access to the clit for either of you.
