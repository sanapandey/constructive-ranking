However, I only started trying to finger myself when I began using tampons, as that\u2019s when I stopped feeling weird about it. But even so, that sensation hasn\u2019t completely gone away, and I can\u2019t seem to figure out how to enjoy fingering. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing it wrong or not, but it feels strange, even a bit uncomfortable, and doesn\u2019t bring me any pleasure. Obviously, I\u2019ve done it relaxed and with proper lubrication, and I\u2019ve tried several times over the years. Is this normal? I refuse to believe it feels like that",

It only feels good when someone else is doing it lol. It\u2019s misleading though since there are a lot of sexy videos of solo women getting off this way and it still fascinates me, but come to terms that\u2019s just not my preferred way of pleasuring myself. G-spot vibes are a good replacement. That I can do and the combination of vibrations and curved shape for hitting the spot is way more comfortable and efficient, for me at least.",

I still get a lot of pleasure from being penetrated by a penis, dildos/fingers do nothing for me. It\u2019s completely normal for a lot of women. Although I am fascinated by the lucky ones that can get off 10 times in a row just by being penetrated.",
