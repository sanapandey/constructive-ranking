When in missionary position I  just feel so stuck!\n\nI usually go into a push up/plank position with my arms placed on the bed at her side and then I just stroke but it feels less intimate and isn\u2019t missionary supposed to be one the most intimate positions? \n\nI want to touch her more rather than just stare, sometimes I want to press on her stomach a bit to help with pleasure for her but I\u2019m afraid the weight imbalance might be too much pressure or maybe even choke her a bit depending on the girl and if she\u2019s into that or even just squeeze her boobs but I can\u2019t \n\nFeels like any action other than thrusting my lower half is going to lead to an accident. Is my form wrong or something? Is it because of a height difference or maybe an exercise I should do? Any advice would help, I feel like this position stops me from being present due to overthinking\n\nThinking the only answer is be strong enough to do one arm plank but that seems really irrational and I\u2019d be too focused on that. I know standing missionary is also a thing but I want to lay on the bed with her for intimacy purposes ",

I think this is called coital alignment or something? Idk you can feel it when you hit the right spot)\n\nHigh posture: you can use your finger on her clit at the same time as thrusting, or put one or two of her legs on your shoulders (bonus points if you push down on her lower stomach at the same time), , you can cross her legs over each other for better stimulation for both of you or push her knees towards her for way deeper thrusts\n\nOh and just a general tip, put a pillow under her hips, it makes the angle way better and everything both feels better and comes easier position wise\n\nAnd ofc kiss her! That's like the best part of missionary, it's super intimate",

            "body": "Slide one arm under her shoulders, which leaves you leaning on your elbow. That's far less tiring than holding yourself up in a plank position, leaves your face close to hers so you can kiss her, and also gives you access to give her neck and collarbone kisses. This position also leaves your other arm free, which gives you a ton of options as well: touch her body, play with her titties, or you can grab her ass and pull her closer to you which is very intimate and lets you fuck her deeper.\n\nIf you start to get tired, you can stretch your arms out around her head and lean on your elbows on the bed. That gives you a break and also puts your face right in front of hers, which makes making out much easier.\n\nDon't worry about the weight of your body unless you're very heavy; the combination of distributing your weight across a lot of her body, plus the fact that you're leaning on your knees and at least one elbow, should make it okay. Besides, some women really like the feeling of their partner's body weight on their body; your lady may be one of them.",
