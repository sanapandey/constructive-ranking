    "selftext": "Hi. After I got divorced with my ex husb. who sexually abused me during our marriage and after I got through some psychological treatment I finally started having sex with other people. Just to find out that I panic when there are certain things happening. For example, if I think that he theoretically can cum inside me. No realistic reason to be scared of it. Just whenever I think that I feel something odd I really get a silent panic attack. My trust with them has never ever been broken. Just that previous experience is how influencing my life. I enjoy sex very much until I get a panic attack. \nMy question is when and how can I cope with these side effects of my past? What is your experience? ",

            "body": "For years I hated the idea of bjs because I was forced at a party with a dude I met there. I hated them and it always made me sick to think about it. YEARS later, I decided one day to tell the guy I was seeing\u2014right before we were about to have sex actually\u2014that I\u2019m not really comfortable and why. He was so comforting and cool with not making me do so that I finally felt like I got my power back. When I was ready I told him how I didn\u2019t think I was good at it at all, but if he\u2019d be patient with me, and never put his hands on my head to push it towards him, I\u2019d like to try. He helped me overcome, and now it\u2019s one of my favorite things to do during sex. It\u2019s such great foreplay and makes them want to flip me right over and go to town. So sexy now. I think the key is finding your power and taking ownership. I\u2019m so sorry you were hurt so deeply.",
