We had sex for the first time, and used a condom so thick I couldn't feel anything. My penis slipped out and I didn't notice. Then her mom came home in the middle of the act and we scrambled to get dressed. Afterwards she kept asking if it counts as losing your virginity if it gets interrupted and nobody gets to cum. I didn't know the answer. She told me it didn't count, so we're both still virgins, then she admitted she wasn't a slut at all and had only ever kissed one boy before that day. \n\nA few months later, I had a new girlfriend named Nikki. She thought condoms were dumb, and wanted to feel what a \"real\" orgasm was like, which meant not pulling out, and not using condoms. I knew it was a bad choice, but I was 14, so I did it anyways. Very lucky I never got her pregnant. I consider this to be my virginity losing moment.",
