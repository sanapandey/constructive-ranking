Even during the act he's not verbal so am not sure whether he likes the sex or whatever I do to him and I have no way of knowing.He was my first and he's usually patient and only doing what am comfortable with but I want to know whether he really enjoys it or is just doing it for my sake. Plus am so insecure about my blowjobs and how I ride him because he had many experienced sex partners before me so am not sure if I give him the pleasure they used to give him and that makes me even more insecure.

Believe it or not more awkward than learning to talk to each other.  I would start by asking him what you asked on the subreddit.   Cheers and good luck.",
