    "selftext": "We have been in a relationship for 5 and half years, living together for 2 and half years. \n\nAt the beginning of our relationship we were long distance and I was horny all the time. When we saw each other we would have sex multiple times a day. Then my libido decreased little by little and for about 2 years now I was completely uninterested in sex. Never wanted to have sex, never feeling aroused, nothing. I could go months without having sex.\n\nWe're having issues with my boyfriend and decided to take a break and think about our relationship. I moved out on March 5. We saw each other again this Saturday (March 15) and had sex, now I can't stop thinking about it. I find myself just like at the beginning of our relationship, thinking about him constantly and imagining us having passionate sex. I'm so horny, I haven't felt that way in a long time. \n\nI know it's not just distance and not seeing him because I went abroad a couple times without him for a week and didn't feel that way. I don't know what's happening to me. ",

If you move back in all those small things will be back and the sex will leave again. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of like how people go to hotels to have a romantic date with their partner and have sex, because at home there is all these stressors like laundry and dishes etc that cause the mood to not get there.",

Typical would be that it lasts until you feel secure again. \n\nThat's not to say there aren't other ways to get better acquainted with how to turn yourself on and feel more sexual. But it will probably be a long term process with lots of trial and error. Do not hold out hope that the issue is just resolved now...",

They just get turned off and might not even think to ask why. \n\nIn my experience with this, I was initially quite attracted to my partner, but over time, we both changed in multiple ways that made me lose that attraction. I quit smoking while he continued, he stopped showering for a while, he lost a lot of weight and muscle mass, we went in polar opposite directions politically which lead to a lot of fights and general tension, he refused to work or clean the house, etc. In the end, I'd just gotten the ick so completely that I didn't want anything to do with any man for a while.\n\nFor many of us, libido is more responsive, not so much intrinsic. If I don't perceive anything that excites me, I don't think about sex all that much. If I'm around people I find sexually attractive, I'll think about it much more. But I don't experience horniness outside of the few days near ovulation without a reason.",

They create their own space where they can maintain some sense of intimate individuality.  Being in close intimate proximity to one's mate constantly can result in the elimination of every and any \"mystery\" about them. Attraction has always included an element of wonder, curiosity and mystery. When living together one can come to know and be familiar with every minute detail of their mate's everyday life, resulting in nothing being left to the imagination, especially in the realm of bodies and sexuality. Resulting in the loss of attraction and desire. There's an old saying, something like \"we all love sausage! But nobody wants to see how it's made.\" \n\nAnother old saying may be applicable here too...\"familiarity breeds contempt\". I've lived this myself within long term relationships. I've come to believe that maintaining some degree of \"mystery\" is healthy for couples. Consider the simple practice of sharing a bed every night. It's a cultural construct, an expectation, maybe even a signal. There's actually no rule requiring it. Could not sharing a bed every night turn the occasions in which you do sleep together into special occasions that encourage more enthusiastic sex?\n\nMaybe you and he could consider the idea and logistics of maintaining separate bedrooms. Remember how thrilling it was early on when you got to go to his space for the night, and vice versa? I've read accounts by happily married couples who take it a step further and maintain separate residences entirely. \n\nAbsence can and does often make the heart grow fonder. Maybe in your case \"absence\" could be no further away than just down hall?  Good Luck",

That didn't help either, but wasn't the cause).\n\nAs soon as we were no longer together, it was like a wall was gone and I had serious libido! Turns out I don't like being pressured into things I don't want, and I don't like being forced to play mommy to a man child.\n\nCould there be something similar going on with you and your boyfriend?",

When we saw each other we would have sex multiple times a day. Then my libido decreased little by little and for about 2 years now I was completely uninterested in sex. Never wanted to have sex, never feeling aroused, nothing. I could go months without having sex.\n\nWe're having issues with my boyfriend and decided to take a break and think about our relationship. I moved out on March 5. We saw each other again this Saturday (March 15) and had sex, now I can't stop thinking about it. I find myself just like at the beginning of our relationship, thinking about him constantly and imagining us having passionate sex. I'm so horny, I haven't felt that way in a long time. \n\nI know it's not just distance and not seeing him because I went abroad a couple times without him for a week and didn't feel that way. I don't know what's happening to me. \n\n***\n\n*AutoSaver v1.0*\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
