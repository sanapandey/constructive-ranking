He is handsome, super kind towards everyone, intelligent, you get it. \n\nThe only problem I can imagine would be our sex life. He does care a lot about my pleasure and is great with his fingers and mouth but he has really big troubles lasting long in PIV. He says it has always been like this for him and he has tried basically everything to help beside antidepressants and no success so far. He barely lasts close to 1-2minutes max, sometimes second round is better but not always.\n\nNow I\u2018m not sure what to do about that situation. Right now I\u2018m not really unhappy with our sex life as he always makes me cum with his tongue but I don\u2019t know if I could go without longer PIV sessions for years in a potential LTR. I know he is very insecure about that and I would hate leaving him for it but I also don\u2019t see myself in a sexually unsatisfied relationship\n\nSo what would you do in my situation? Would you accept only 1min PIV sessions long term if everything else was great?",

Condoms tend to make me last longer. And keeping my hips still (which usually means girl on top) actually helps me last the longest. You two will likely be different but perhaps you can discover something that works.\n\nAfter trying everything you can think of, and coming from someone who considers good sex to be a crucial part of my romantic relationships (I know this isn't true for everyone, okay?), I would strongly consider moving on.",
