Decades of practice still isn't going to make oral with a condom good for either of you. It pretty much defeats the object. So you either make the best of it, or hold off on blow jobs until you've seen clear STI panels. You don't have to go down on someone you just met and why would you if it's not going to be fun for you?",

Eye contact, dirty talk, warm your coconut oil in the microwave beforehand so it is body temp and liquid. You can use all kinds of techniques with your hands to make it feel good. Use your breasts as well. There is no fluid interaction with hands and penis, so you don't need a condom (assuming you don't have cuts on your hands - If you do wear vinyl/latex gloves and play up the naughty nurse angle). Moving your hands like a pepper grinder, putting your hands in prayer position with him in between, moaning as you stroke him. It can be super hot.",

But I've also never once seen a guy do that move on himself...which leads me to believe I might be onto something..? lol\n\nLike I'm sure that with a lot of lube, it's not **not** pleasurable...but I feel like that's something that could so easily go wrong, if there's suddenly not enough lubrication for whatever reason\n\nThoughts on that one?",

Sex journalists and sites often run a product roundup for condoms that work well for blow jobs (search the web for e.g. \"best condoms for oral sex\")\n* Consider putting a few drops (or even more) of lubricant \\_inside\\_ the condom. When you're going down on him, a bit of lube inside the condom will help the condom slide back and forth against his skin and strongly improve the sensation.\n* Practice using your hand! Using your hand to stroke his cock while you're sucking it is always a useful trick, but will be extra helpful when he's wearing a condom.\n\nGood luck! This absolutely can be done in a way that feels good for your fella but may take some practice. It sounds like he's receptive and open to trying different things, so hopefully he'll be up for encouraging you to practice!",
