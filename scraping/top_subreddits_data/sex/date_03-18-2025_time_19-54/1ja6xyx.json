            "body": "I rarely vent about my \"sticky cummer\" (as I like to call it), but... last night was so frustrating!\n\nHadn't seen FWB in a couple weeks, and have been not masturbating to kind of save it up. Last time, I was able to get myself there during PIV surprisingly quick (I usually need to get myself there without other stuff in the mix, or have him hold pretty much still), and it was lovely and happened so easily. I thought I'd broken through.\n\nWe both had kids last night. He has a large van. Last time we hooked up in his van, he squashed me up in the captains chair and \"unlocked\" my a-spot and I was nearly there- which would have been first time having a partner make me cum AND first PIV orgasm. A-spot has been my masturbatory fascination of late.\n\nI tried to set up a re-do of that, but he was feeling feisty (which I love), so he grabbed me by the hair and flipped me against the chair and went at things primarily doggy (an always with him). He usually doesn't do this, but it was cute that he was pulling my head around by the hair to look at him every time I tucked my head into the seat. Moved to the back bench, and he came when we were face-to-face (anal with my knees over his shoulders) he was exceptionally expressive this time (I think he'd stocked it up, too) and it was like a waiter walking past your table with a sizzling plate of fajitas when you haven't had a meal in two weeks.\n\nSo, I'm like \"My turn... can you help me out?\"\n\nI'm trying to get myself there. He's rifling the clothes on the floor of the van searching for his underpants and clothes with one hand, distractedly poking at my vagina with the other. A few \"that's so hot\"s thrown in.\n\nHe gets his pants on and is sitting in the turned-around captains chair, I'm on the side bench... so close, so close. \n\nHe decides he wants to see better, so he flips on the rear cabin overhead lights, and they are BLINDING.\n\nAnd, thus, the moment was ruined.\n\nOh, and he's nearly 50, but I was literally having to move his finger to where my clitoris is when we were making out clothed earlier. He was like \"Oh, that's where it is?\" (Um... yeah.) Then, he moved his finger back to where he always has it, which is like tweaking that tendon that runs through the groin-- NOWHERE NEAR the clit.\n\nDunno if maybe his ex wife liked her adductor tendon tweaked or he's just never bothered to locate a clitoris, but... Jesus Fucking Christ, man! We're fully grown adults, here!\n\nI do love our chemistry, he's a naughty boy and just utterly expressive and vocal and all-around adorable. I do love all the fond memories I get to take back with me into alone time. But... yeah.\n\nNights like last night, I just have to shake my head at the idiocy of the whole thing.",

            "body": "I am 40ish year old Male with a huge thing for legs, I just love thighs and legs, and calves etc. It is such a turn on for me. My eyes automatically wander to a womans legs, I am such a fan. I never really thought I was into anything about feet except for when a pair of high heels are attached to them. High heels make legs look even better!!\n\nA couple of weeks ago I met up with a girl I am sleeping with and she positioned herself seated in front of me on the bed with her legs out in front and started masturbating, I started stroking my cock as well while admiring her body and legs, I then moved her feet over on to my cock and squirted some lube on it and then she started to rub my cock between her feet. Was completely new for me and one of the biggest turn ons I have had in a while.\n\nBeing able to watch her play with herself while rubbing my cock with her feet (she has very petite cute little feet) was extremely hot. She also mentioned afterwards that it was a huge turn on for her as well, especially as she saw how much I enjoyed it. She also said the next time we meet up that she will make me cum with her feet. I cannot wait for that. We have both come out of long relationships with very boring sex, and we really enjoy trying new things out and seeing what new things turn us on.\n\nAnyone else enjoy feet on cock?",
