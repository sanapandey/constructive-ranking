    "selftext": "*The mods of /r/sex make it our policy to review the rules of the sub on an ongoing basis, tweaking items as necessary.  In an effort to stay abreast with the growth of the sub and with the evolving moderation that requires, we have decided to re-sticky the updated rules to serve as a reminder for our membership.*\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nr/sex is for civil discussions pertaining to education and advice regarding your sexuality and sexual relationships. It is a sex-positive community and a safe space for people of all genders and orientations which demands respectful conduct in all exchanges.  There is **ZERO TOLERANCE FOR CREEPY/HARASSING BEHAVIOR here** \u2014 in posts, comments, messages, or any other contributions. No exceptions.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nThis is a large community dedicated to an extremely popular topic.  If you wish to participate, it is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with our rules of conduct **BEFORE** you participate here.  Failure to do so will result in your removal from the community.  \n\n**PLEASE READ** the [FAQ](https://reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/index) with the most asked and answered questions - **BEFORE POSTING!!** Posts that do not follow the posting guidelines in the FAQ will be automatically removed.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n**THE /R/SEX RULES**\n\n**1) ENGAGE CONSTRUCTIVELY AT ALL TIMES.**   \nThis means ensuring that ALL of your contributions here are constructive, on-topic, mature, sex-positive, civil and respectful.  Disrespectful conduct will see you banned from the community on the spot.  Hitting on other people, asking for pictures (joking or not), making any sort of sexist comment or insult, body shaming, or trolling of any sort will result in your immediate ban.\n\n**2) DON\u2019T SKIP THE FAQ OR THE FORUM RULES.**  \nWe\u2019re serious about this. Dozens of posts get removed every day because they\u2019re covered in the FAQ or violate the forum rules.\n\n**3) DON'T OVERLOOK PAST POSTS.**   \nWe\u2019re serious about this, too. Many questions may be new to you, but are very common in our community. Before you submit a post on a common topic, search the forum.\n\n**4) ALL CONTRIBUTIONS MUST BE SEX POSITIVE.**   \nWe demand that consenting adults be free to express their sexuality as they see fit. Kink shaming, slut shaming, and similar conduct will not be tolerated.  Links or references to sex negative communities or websites (No Fap, Porn Free, etc) will not be tolerated.  Attacks on the lifestyle of other consenting adults will not be tolerated.\n\n**5) POSTS SEEK ADVICE, COMMENTS PROVIDE IT.**   \nThe main forum is focused primarily on posts seeking specific actionable advice for distinctive personal situations. Giving advice should primarily be done in the comments. General discussions are often allowed, so long as they adhere to the group rules and restricted content guidelines. If you want to make an exception, please request approval from moderators.\n\n**6) DO NOT TROLL OR ENGAGE WITH TROLLS HERE.**   \nDon\u2019t try to challenge, question, tease, fight, or outwit trolls here. Instead, use the Report button to alert moderators, who will review every single reported item.  Trolling of any sort merits an immediate permaban.\n\n**7) ALL DISCUSSION MUST BE DIRECTED INTO THE PUBLIC FORUM.** Do not seek private conversations here, via Private Message or any other method. And do not seek to draw attention or clicks to an outside site of any type (unless you have received prior moderator approval, such as for academic research projects). Every comment here must be a clear attempt to engage with an ongoing public discussion in the forum. Violations of this rule will result in permanent bans without notice.\n\n**8) RESTRICTED CONTENT** \nThis sub is generally only for seeking advice, education, or discussion about sex and sexuality. We restrict or forbid many types of content here.\n\n**9) NO USE OF AI FOR POSTING/COMMENTS, NO REPOSTS**  \nReddit uses AI detection software to spot potential bot-posts and spam but people are encouraged to report posts that look fake, AI-generated, or are reposts of content created by other users.  \n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n**EXAMPLES OF CONTENT RESTRICTED IN /R/SEX:**\n\n**1) PROMOTIONAL POSTS.**   \nThis means any post containing any kind of promotional element, especially one which seeks to lure traffic to another site or promote a product. Links to specific product descriptions are permitted if they\u2019re PRECISELY on-topic in the context of the post, AND the post itself is clearly seeking advice in good faith.  If you're trying to sell something, conduct market research, etc - these posts will get you banned.  Linking to sex-positive blogs or podcasts is allowed, provided you make an effort to start a conversation here about the topic and use the link as supporting material.\n\n**2) LINK POSTS.**   \nLinked material must be sex positive and precisely on-topic to stay up here, and needs to be introduced with a workable framework for discussion. Please see the posted [Link Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/linkpolicy) **BEFORE** you post links!  Bare links to youtube, images, blogs, podcasts, etc are prohibited.\n\n**3) ACHIEVEMENT POSTS.**   \nThese include appreciation, humblebrags, \u201cI just had to share,\u201d \u201cI just want to say,\u201d etc. These belong in the Daily Sexual Achievement Thread, not in the main forum. Posts which are JUST sex stories belong somewhere else entirely \u2014 like r/sexstories or a similar forum.  \n\n**4) LOW EFFORT MATERIAL.**    \n\u201cDoes anyone else...?\u201d, \u201cIs [X] normal/weird?\u201d, \u201cIs [y] wrong/bad/okay?\u201d, and so forth.  Human sexuality is incredibly varied; yes, someone else likes what you like, and labels like \"normal\" or \"weird\" are meaningless - and in a sex positive community, we do not allow any moral judgments against sex acts or behaviors that are consensual.  Title-only posts, posts with no effort at an actual conversation will be removed and may get you banned.  Comments that consist of nothing but memes, \"this\", \"lol\" and such are highly disfavored.  If comments do not further the discussion, they may be removed; a pattern of these may result in your ban.\n   \n**5) SEEKING FAP MATERIAL.**   \nDo not ask for sex stories, do not ask for the hottest/strangest/most unusual/etc encounter someone ever had.  Do not ask for lists of other people's kinks.  \n\n**6) PORNOGRAPHY, EROTICA, OR PERSONALS.**    \nYou may not post or link pornography or erotica here.  You may not share pictures of your genitals here - even if you are seeking medical advice (if you need to post a picture, you need to be going to a doctor).  You may not recruit sex partners here, look for dirty chat, ask for someone to private message you, etc.\n\n**7) DISRESPECTFUL CONTENT.**   \nPersonal attacks, insults, name calling, or disrespect of any sort are not allowed here.  Sexism, racism, or any type of hate speech will result in your immediate ban.  This is a community for **ALL GENDERS** - refusing to acknowledge a trans individual's gender flies in the face of this, and will result in your ban.  \n\n**8) OPINION SEEKING, POLLS, VALUE JUDGEMENTS, OR VALIDATION POSTS.**    \nThis forum is not for simply collecting opinions - \"do you think [X] is hot?\", \"Women, do you like [Y]?\", \"What is your favorite sex position?\" and so forth.  This is not a forum to discuss your penis size, breast size, labia size, ask about other body image issues, or ask for feedback on your photos.  See the /r/sex FAQ for help regarding body image issues.  Do not post your pictures and ask people to rate or critique you.  Do not ask if given consensual sexual interests are good/bad/okay/wrong, etc.\n\n**9) ACADEMIC SURVEYS.**   \nThese require prior moderator approval. Moderators will review the question formats and will review the documentation of institutional ethical oversight (please provide). Non-academic surveys are seldom allowed.  Please contact the moderators BEFORE you post a survey or study.  \n\n**10) GENERAL RANTS, ESSAYS, EDITORIALS, VENTS, CONFESSIONS, PSAS, AND AMAS.**    \nThese don\u2019t belong in the main forum unless you have obtained prior moderator approval. Save them for story-based forums. Or Tumblr.\n\n**11) FREQUENT/FAMILIAR TOPICS.**   \nThese are addressed in either the FAQ, past posts, or both.  In case you are confused, this means that we **do not do penis size posts here.**  \n\n**12) VAGUE TITLE/TOPIC.**   \nIf a moderator can\u2019t identify your issue or the type of advice you\u2019re seeking, your post will be subject to removal.  Titles should be at least several words long and adequately express what your post is about.\n\n**13) NONCONSENSUAL OR ILLEGAL CONTENT.**   \n/r/sex is for the discussion of consensual sex among adults.  We do not permit posts that advocate pedophilia, bestiality, rape, or incest here under any circumstances, nor do we allow these topics at all in most instances.  Note that BDSM and CNC (consensual nonconsent) are perfectly valid topics in /r/sex.\n\n**14) OTHER OFF TOPIC ISSUES.**    \nThis is not the place to discuss politics or religion, to seek dating advice, to ask for how to pick up women, to rant about how you have never had sex.  Posts that appear to be dedicated to stirring up arguments - particularly about hot button topics like circumcision, the evils of pornography and/or masturbation, and other toxic subjects - will be removed and will result in swift bans.\n\n**15) IMPORTANT NOTE ON DISCUSSIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.**  \nSexual assault is an important and emotional topic which can be discussed (constructively) in r/sex. But posts which simply seek opinions about whether a given scenario counts as sexual assault do not do well here. This is true for several reasons, including the fact that assault laws vary by jurisdiction, and we don't encourage debates about jurisdiction issues here. Therefore, we ask that you refrain from describing a scenario and then simply asking \u201cIs this rape/assault?\u201d Instead, ask for specific advice: About how to respond to the scenario, how to avoid it, or how to proceed with next steps. **Posts which simply ask \u201cIs this rape/assault?\u201d are subject to removal without notice.**\n\n**16) POST LENGTH.**   \nFor ease of reading and reviewing, please get to the point of your post quickly \u2014 in the post title, first paragraph, etc. Consider adding a tl;dr to long posts.  Posts which are inconveniently long \u2014 over 600 words, approximately \u2014 are subject to automatic removal. Also, line and paragraph breaks are VERY HELPFUL for readers and reviewers \u2014 walls of text that lack these are subject to removal for readability.\n\nFurther information about the /r/sex rules and policies can be reviewed on the [rules page](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/rules).\n\n***\n\n**Other Relevant Sub-Reddits:**\n\n\u2022 [BDSM Community](/r/BDSMcommunity)\n\n\u2022 [DeadBedrooms](/r/DeadBedrooms)\n\n\u2022 [Dirty Pen Pals](/r/dirtypenpals)\n\n\u2022 [Gone Wild](/r/gonewild)\n\n\u2022 [Ladyboners Gone Wild](/r/ladybonersgw)\n\n\u2022 [LGBT Sex](/r/lgbtsex)\n\n\u2022 [LGBT](http://reddit.com/r/lgbt)\n\n\u2022 [Normal Nudes](http://www.reddit.com/r/normalnudes)\n\n\u2022 [One Y Chromosome](/r/OneY)\n\n\u2022 [Polyamory](/r/polyamory)\n\n\u2022 [Redditor for Redditor (Personals)](/r/r4r)\n\n\u2022 [Relationships](/r/relationships)\n\n\u2022 [Sex Stories](/r/gonewildstories)\n\n\u2022 [Sex Toys](/r/SexToys)\n\n\u2022 [Swingers](/r/swingers)\n\n\u2022 [Transgender](/r/transgender)\n\n\u2022 [Two X Chromosomes](/r/TwoXChromosomes)",
