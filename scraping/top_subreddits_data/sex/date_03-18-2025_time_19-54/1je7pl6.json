Secondly, if he can go in just a little way, pause, let your muscles relax, then a little further, and so on. If you are on top you can control the depth exactly and hold his penis to maintain the right angle. Stick with the lube. \n\nIf that doesn't work, consult a doctor to check for any physical difficulties.",

The natural lubrication and softness of the skin might help it go in. They also seem to mess with my natural ph and I get sore more easily with condoms. I repeat Do not risk pregnancy or STDs tho.",
