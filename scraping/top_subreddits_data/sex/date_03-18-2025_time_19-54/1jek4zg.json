    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI think I'll talk briefly about myself first. I am male, 20 years old, have ADHD and think my preferences are too extreme. I was in 2 longer relationships and again and again after some time (about half a year) a feeling of dissatisfaction with the sex life opened up. I had good sex with both partners, but after that time it was just not enough. We often tied up and used toys, which made the whole thing more interesting, but somehow was not enough. After the time I had more and more desire for more extreme things, such as more dominance, face f*cking, making your own movies for yourself, anal, ... I think you already know in which direction I mean. Of course also everything with limit so with pee etc. is a Limit for me. So far at least...\n\nI have always communicated this openly, without forcing anything of course, but unfortunately this was not really discussed. Of course, a whip would be used here and there or something would go in the face etc. But that was only twice a year. In general, I would just like to feel sexually free with a partner (relationship or just sex) and live my needs. I'm not a fan of getting into the bed with any person, but would like to let off steam with a single partner. I have therefore always refused One Night Stands, although I really have the Changse without wanting to give in. But that's not my way. Since I've had such problems with ADHD, this desire has also increased and is getting bigger and bigger. I would love to let everything out with someone reasonable.\n\nHence to my questions. Are my fetishes too extreme? Is it already a sex addiction? Has anyone had similar experiences? If so, how has it improved? Or how did you find common partners for something like that? Aren't such fetishes already questionable and abnormal? What do you just think in general?\n\nOh, and if anyone gets it wrong. I have always been very respectful to my former partners, I absolutely respect boundaries, but simply openly communicate my preferences.\n\nThanks to everyone who writes a comment, I'm happy about every single one. If you report on your own experience, you can also write to me privately if you don't want it to be public.",

It was like hell for me, living with my ex girlfriend and Watch her flawless naked Body every Morning and evening, with the Knowledge that my Lust is held in chains. I was at the verge of exploding. \nYou sound like you had issues with something simular as well? How did you deal with it? \n\nThanks for your coment btw",

You're a sub. I do what I want and you like it. That's how this works.\"\n\nOnly, it did NOT work.\n\nBasically, I learned a lot about myself and that I do need to find ways to keep things new and fresh, and a partner aligned with keeping things new and fresh. \n\nI try to \"ration\" new experiences when I get into relationships vs \"everything, all-the-time, all-at-once\" which, yes, sounds lovely, but you run out of (legal, appropriate) stuff pretty quick.\n\nIt's ultimately a dopamine addiction, so I follow a lot about that online-- just because it might be showing up for you primarily in a sexual setting, it might also be in play elsewhere in your life (hence, why I'm where all the time while working.) \n\nYou can find healthy ways to scratch that itch 9I like fitness stuff where you can always have goals and \"new things,\" like Crossfit or distance running). Learning new things. Anything that gives you that feeling of new and then conquering something (I have a STRING of hobbies I've gotten just good enough to say I was good at and then abandoned.)\n\nIn partnerships, it's about finding someone equally novelty-seeking... even if it's not sexual, doing something new that neither of us have done (I dunno... rock climbing, axe throwing, new food experiences, etc.) brings the zing back sexually for me, too.\n\nNot getting too familiar with each other to where you say, \"You'll never guess what happened this morning!\" and they say, \"Yeah, I know. I was there.\" \n\nAnd... I am a bit like you that I am also a weird sideslice of Demi, so casual sex isn't for me... it's not about the partners, it's about the experiences.",
