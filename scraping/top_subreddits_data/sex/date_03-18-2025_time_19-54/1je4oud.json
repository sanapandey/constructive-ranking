Another option is a sex swing. It is possible to make the hook unnoticeable in the ceiling. It is an excellent option for people with mobility problems or pain in certain positions.",

Throw a towel or blanket over the pillows to keep them a little cleaner. My spouse and I use pillows to prop up and support our bodies during both \u201cdoggy style\u201d (hate that name: Woman-on-all-fours instead) and cowgirl/woman-on-top missionary. \n\nProps, pillows and supports are a normal part of sex for us and we are healthy and well.

We actually shot one of our videos of us on the esses chair.   I just wish it was a bit narrower.  I have short legs and it\u2019s tough for me to stand with my legs around it sometimes.  I think they do make thinner ones other companies.    . We also have the wedges which are super nice. You haven\u2019t done a movie with those yet though might be coming.  We actually just use those on top of the bed so yes, I recommend them specially for geriatric folks like myself or anybody who might have some mobility issues. Cheers, and good luck.",
