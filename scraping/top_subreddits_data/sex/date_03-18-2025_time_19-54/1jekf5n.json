We still live together because we have 2 kids and because housing is too expensive for us to afford two separate places. We get along fine, but the intimate and sexual part of our relationship is done. \n\nI have not had sex in 3 years and I\u2019m getting to the point where it\u2019s making me crazy. I have considered having an affair. But I work remotely, and after work and on the weekends I\u2019m busy with family and home stuff so I don\u2019t really have the opportunity to be out and about all that much. And even if I could get out more, I think I\u2019m too awkward and plain to attract a woman, and even if I could, I would have no idea how to navigate the weird limbo state my marriage is in. \n\nSo, as the headline says, I\u2019m thinking of seeing an escort. I have questions for those of you who have done this. \n\n1. How did you feel after you were with the escort? Did you feel satisfied? Relieved? Sad? Something else?\n\n2. During your time with the escort, did you ever feel like you were degrading them, or did it feel enthusiastic and consensual?\n\n3. Did you feel that you got \u201caddicted\u201d to seeing escorts, or did the experience scratch your itch?\n\n4. How did you minimize risk? I\u2019m not worried about my wife finding out. More that I\u2019ll get arrested. I\u2019ve been on Tryst and Eros and The Erotic Review, and it seems like pursuing an escort who presents as more \u201chigh quality\u201d and doing my research before booking is a big part of managing risk.\n\nThank you very much for reading and again I\u2019m sorry if this is not the appropriate place for this.

            "body": "I have never hired an escort, but I have 2 thoughts. \n\n1. How is it an affair if you have agreed to separate? Have you explicitly said you are not in a romantic/monogamous relationship anymore? If yes, this is not an affair. If you haven't spoke about ending the romantic relationship and sleeping with others, you need to do that first. \n\n2. I knew a guy who grew up with certain cultural expectations around relationships which he felt he could not meet. So he did not date or seek a gf. So he went to a sex worker regularly- always the same woman. Once a month or so i think. \n\nHe spoke about her with a kind of affectionate respect, without being romantic or too personal. Kind of like the vibe you'd have with a really good mechanic or hairdresser you've been going to for years. Respect for the trade and skill, some kind of personal relationship, a friendliness, while also recognising you're paying for a service that they're good at. It takes time to develop that rapport I guess, but the intent of professional respect can be there from the start. \n\nA risk of arrest is a whole different thing and a different risk to manage depending on your legal context.",

                    "body": "1 - Good question\u2026I guess it would only be an affair in a technical sense, since we are still legally married. When we first talked about it, my wife said she was interested in a co-worker romantically, and I told her I\u2019d have no problem with her pursuing him. We didn\u2019t explicitly talk about me pursuing other women, but I suspect she\u2019d be OK with it. \n\n2 - This is an interesting perspective. I have often doubted that I am truly capable of maintaining a healthy romantic relationship. I definitely have my shortcomings, which is why I am where I am. Maybe I should consider this kind of arrangement for myself. \n\nThank you for the thoughtful response.",

(And, I don't mean that in a puritanical, emotional-connection way. I just mean in it in a chemistry-- probably with a sideslice of being wanted and validated for more than having the appropriate amount of cash-- way.)\n\nAlso, you're pretty unlikely to get arrested (at least, if in the US and both people are consenting and you aren't picking trafficked people up off a street corner where there might be a sting that goes FAR higher than whatever you and an autonomous, consenting human decide to do. Also-- good evidence SHE'D be in more of a mess than you.)",

I have never had a one night stand and have only been with 3 women in my life so I\u2019m not 100% sure I could even perform. A big part of what I miss about sex is kissing, touching, and physical closeness. It\u2019s not just about the sex act. And I\u2019m not sure how much (if any) of that intimacy I would get from this kind of interaction.",
