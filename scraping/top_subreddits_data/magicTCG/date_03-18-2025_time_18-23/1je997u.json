It should be noted that they have shifted where the value is in releases: Every set now comes with chase variants (for Tarkir Dragonstorm there's a serial, there's the SPG fetchlands that can even come in a special treatment) which generally account for a chunk of booster box EV. This helps put downward pressure on the base versions of cards in these sets. Yeah sure, there are usually 1-2 format warping cards that get propped back up from high demand, but most sets only have like 3-5 cards that are worth 2 digits in their base version around release nowadays. Think of something like Foundations were Twinflame Tyrant (I'm going off of EU prices from Cardmarket here) is around 13,50\u20ac in it's base version, 30\u20ac in full art foil, 50\u20ac in mana foil and even more in the textured foil. \n\nDon't forget that most sets are standard legal. You cannot simply reprint any card in a standard legal main set, the health of the format needs to be considered. There's a lot of powerful dragons that could have used a reprint but that simply have no place in standard. Special Guest and Bonus Sheet reprints usually don't put much downward pressure on the price due to the scarcity, but thematically the ancient dragon cycle from baldurs gate would have been a great include there.",

Why would you choose the worst case scenario when you're comparing her to Anointed Procession? Worst case Anointed Procession is spending all your mana on turn 4 to play an enchantment that does nothing this turn and requires you to have another card (a token generator) to do anything the next turn. \n\nThe ceiling on Elspeth is multitudes higher. That might or might not be compensated by Anointed Procession by coming down a turn earlier and being harder to remove. And since that depends a lot on the deck you're playing I find the cards to be too different to directly compare them. \n\nI play a token centric deck and have recently removed Anointed Procession from my list because of the tempo loss on my 4th turn. Mondrak remained because he's a body that can defend me for a turn. \n\nI'll gladly include Elspeth for her versatility and the random oops I win factor.",

Could you please make an Elspeth that has Anointed Procession stapled to her and also, has a +1 that makes creature tokens? The other abilities can be, like, an anthem and/or removal, or something. And if she only costs 4\\~5 mana, that'd be great, thanks.  \nSincerely,  \nu/X_Marcs_the_Spot",
