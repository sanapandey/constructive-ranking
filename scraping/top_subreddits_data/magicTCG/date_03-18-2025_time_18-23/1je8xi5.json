Not only is that great in Isshin decks, it's great with this card, since a crazy spam of strong deathtouch tokens can quickly win the game even off of just one extra combat. You can't chump a board with deathtouch more than once unless your shit's all indestructible or has first strike.\n\nThis could go absolutely apeshit with Urabrask's Forge, since deathtouch + trample means you can no longer meaningfully block any of their damage without first strike. The first damage kills your creature and all the rest tramples through. Get ready to see this in FOMO + Forge decks.",
