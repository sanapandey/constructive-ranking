                                                    "body": "Here is one retelling at lesson # 1 \n\n[https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/twenty-years-twenty-lessons-part-1-2016-05-30](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/twenty-years-twenty-lessons-part-1-2016-05-30)\n\n  \n\\>My first lesson begins back in October of 2006 with the set\u00a0*Time Spiral*. In it, we had a mechanic called suspend.\n\n\\>Suspend was a mechanic that let you trade time for money\u2014or mana, in\u00a0*Magic*'s case. Normally when you play a spell it resolves right away; with suspend, you got to pay much less for it, but in exchange you had to wait some number of turns before it got cast. Let's take the card\u00a0\\[\\[[Errant Ephemeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant+Ephemeron)\\]\\]\u00a0as an example.\n\n\\>If you want to cast this card normally, it takes seven mana\u2014but if you cast it with suspend, it only takes two mana. The catch is that you have to wait four turns before it enters the battlefield. So, here was the problem. In playtesting, we found that players kept wanting to attack with the suspended creatures as soon as they were cast. But the\u00a0*Magic*\u00a0rules don't normally allow creatures to attack the turn you cast them unless they have the ability haste, which lets you override this rule.\n\n\\>When we explored the issue, what we found was that because they had waited so long to get the suspended creature, players associated the creatures finally getting cast with them mattering, so it felt appropriate to attack with them right away.\n\n\\>We tried rewriting the cards to remind the players that they weren't allowed to attack. We tried visual cues. We considered having the creatures enter the battlefield after combat so they wouldn't be able to attack. In the end, the solution was actually a simple one\u2014let the players attack. We gave all suspended creatures haste so that the players could just do what they expected. This leads us to my first lesson:\n\n**>Lesson #1\u2014Fighting against human nature is a losing battle**\n\n\\>In game design (and most things where you interact with an audience), there's a saying: \"Know your audience.\" Well, guess what? Your audience for game design is humans. They come with a complex operating system. It's quirky at times, but it can be understood. Just remember that humans are quite stubborn. They like to do things the way they like to do them and it's hard to change their behavior.\n\n\\>What I've learned over the years is that you shouldn't change your players to match your game; you should change your game to match your players. Don't get yourself into a fight you're probably not going to win. Human behavior is a powerful force. We are creatures of habit and instinctually fear change. Yes, there are things that come along\u2014like the cell phone\u2014that humans change their behavior around, but don't assume your game is going to be one of those revolutionary things.",

They're just a specific type of counter. Suspend isn't the only thing that uses time counter. Examples: vanishing mechanic, like [[Dreamtide Whale]], or cards like [[As Foretold]], [[Cursed Recording]]\n\nThe suspend keyword itself is what allows you to cast cards exiled with time counters. I also don't believe that cards are considered suspended if they don't have the suspend keyword, which is relevant for effects that can add/remove counters to suspended cards.\n\nI think [[Alaundo the Seer]] is the only card/mechanic outside of suspend that allows you to play exiled cards with time counters by removing the time counters. Though, you could technically play exiled cards like Squee, the Immortal if they got suspended.",
