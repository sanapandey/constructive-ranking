It'd work if you could replace the hippocamp with a cmc4 [[Extraction Specialist]]/Karmic Guide variant, but I don't see one that works without adding even more resources.\n\nIf you add [[Blood artist]] to the opening hand then you can do t1 elf, t2: wall of roots+sidisi, t3: buried alive for deceiver exarch & [[crypt champion]], play blood artist, sidisi wall of roots into crypt champion, returning deceiver exarch to play, sacrificing the pit champion, and draining them for 1, demonstrating a loop. This line isn't too bad because you can do it a turn later by getting blood artist on the buried alive and using the first sidisi activation to put the blood artist into play from your elf.\n\nIf you replace the blood artist with a 0-2 mana historic spell you can instead buried alive for exarch, [[Teshar, Ancestor's Apostle]], and Kiki. Teshar lets you play the cheap historic card to bring back the exarch, then sidisi the Teshar into Kiki and make infinite deceiver exarchs.",

The templating should be closer to [[Scrap Welder]] than pods.\n\n> Why does it have to specify that you have to sacrifice a creature \"you control\"?? \n\nFortunately, Felothar uses the regular wording for this, so it's likely a mistake.\nI would guess they were originally going to make it exile instead of sacrifice (like [[Fabrication Foundry]]) to prevent easy infinites with [[Corridor Monitor]] or similar. Later in design, they might have decided to make it \"sacrifice for exactly X+1\" instead of \"exile for X+1 or less\" and forgot to change the wording.",
