    "selftext": "RULES:\n\n1. No stores or dealers selling on here.  We won't stop stores from responding to sell posts with buy offers, though. At that point, it's up to the seller to accept or reject the offer.  \n\n2. Do not spam this thread. Your sell/trade offer(s) should be confined to one post per week. If you list multiple cards as separate orders, or multiple lots of cards as separate orders, do so in the same post with a clear delineation. As a seller, you may post whether you want offers within the thread or whether you want a private message. If you want to make this different for different listings, that's your prerogative. State what country you're shipping from and include shipping price+method for your own country. If you are willing to ship to other countries, say so. \n\n3. **No eBay posts.**\n\n4.  If a card is sold/traded, edit your post and invalidate any pending offers for that card. \"Short selling\" is not acceptable here, since we're dealing in physical goods and shipping times may be an issue, especially if the buyer is a tournament player. Do not short sell cards.\n\n5.  Buyers: Post your offer directly underneath a sell listing, unless you are topping someone else's offer, in which case you should post directly underneath that offer.\n\n6.  Buyers: Feel free to post a \"want\" list. \n\n7.  For the sake of preventing identity theft and/or harassment, do NOT post identifying information (name, address, paypal info) in the thread.\n\n8.  No throwaway accounts.\n\n9.  Needless to say, we're Magic players. We don't necessarily have to pay in cash. It's entirely up to the seller whether to consider \"2 Force of Will\" as a higher/lower bid than $160.\n\n10.  There is also a deckbox.org trading area that can be used as well, at \nhttp://deckbox.org/communities/reddit_mtg_trades.\n\nIf you have any comments about the rules rather than about a particular auction, feel free to discuss them here.\n\nPAYPAL FEE INFO:\n(Quoted from Paypal)\n\nFree when the money comes from PayPal balance or bank account.\n\n2.9% + $0.30 USD\nwhen the money comes from a debit or credit card or PayPal Credit\n\nMAILING INFO: See [USPS Link.](http://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/101.htm)\n\n**SCAMMER INFO: I will not link it directly here, but be sure to check out the scammer list on deckbox before doing any trading to ensure yourself to having a safe trade!**\n\nYou probably can't mail off more than one toploader in a normal envelope+stamp due to it being too rigid; and you shouldn't do this for more than $10-20 worth of cards anyway since there's no tracking. Get a bubble mailer and get it tracked.",
