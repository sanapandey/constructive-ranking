Show and tell is the only one with both AFAIK, and it wants stock up anyway because A) it's not BUG, B) stock up sees more cards, and C) SnT doesn't use its graveyard or beanstalk. The main reason to play this over stock up is to trigger beanstalk or if your deck uses its graveyard (Uro, loam, etc). But Yorion beans is mostly not in black right now, and neither it nor BUG beans is playing stock up, and it's not even clear this is better than stock up in those lists. I guess we'll find out.",
