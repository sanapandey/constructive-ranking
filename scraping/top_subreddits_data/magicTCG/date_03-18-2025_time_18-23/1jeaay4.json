For example if you wanted to play Jeskai (W/U/R) and you wanted a fetchland that was able to fetch all three of those colors ... you'd run the U/B fetchland alongside a W/U dual and a B/R dual. You got access to black for free in your deck.\n\nSo 4 color soup is what people did, and Standard was dominated by it.",

At the time in standard there were also dual lands that were land types so the lands that fetch can go and grab those. The issue is Tarkir is a \u201cwedge\u201d set, meaning it\u2019s based on three color pair \u201cwedges\u201d. Basically, look at the back of a magic card and you\u2019ll see the color pie. Each color has two allied colors (next to it) and two enemy colors (far from it). A wedge has two enemy color pairs and one allied color (so jeskai is UW which is an allied color pair, and UR/RW which are enemy pairs). This caused issues in that standard because Tarkir was designed around these wedges, but the fetch lands supported allied color pairs. Combine this with the allied color lands that can be fetched and it caused a situation where four colors was actually easier to do than three colors",
