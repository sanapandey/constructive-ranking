However most of the time if you have Tron online you\u2019re already winning so instead of wanting to raise that ceiling you want to play cards that are decent even without Tron online.\n\nYou can see that in this Tron list I pulled from mtggoldfish where the only cards that are 7+ mana are Devourer/nulldrifter (essentially labyrinth fodder that also do stuff early) and all is dust (also lab fodder and works with E temple)\n\nhttps://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/tron#paper",

This on the other hand does all of that, PLUS has an ultimate that can and will literally win you the game with the Chromatic Orrery combo, plus you can use the mana made from him on your Upheaval, Treasure Mage, and even in the worst case scenario where you're using the 3 mana to just cast a map that uncounterably exiles a creature, you also get the added benefit of being able to also tutor a land with that same mana.\n\nOn your upheaval turns, using the -11 for Orrery (assuming it's not on the battlefield already), Karn TGC, and a second Ugin is a deterministic win that can win through basically everything except Orim's Chant, since you can grab all of the pieces in Main Phase 1, and then pass to Main Phase 2 and go off there.",

The Ugin Planeswalker doesn't help smooth out your draws, but it is a must answer threat if it hits the battlefield. Both pitch to Eldrazi temple and have an exile on cast effect. \n\nI think the Ugin is slightly better if it hits the battlefield because it can help with card advantage or dropping a bigger Eldrazi the next turn. If the plus 2 draws a cheap colorless spell then it can exile 2 things the turn it drops. \n\nThe downside compared to Devourer of Destiny is that it is easier to counter since its not a creature. It also can't block which could be relevant against aggro decks like boros energy. And swapping Ugin for Devourer of Destiny doesn't help against Combo decks so I don't think it will make a huge difference in Modern.",

Those decks play colorless enablers that this exile effect can't hit. I agree that this will see some modern play, which already makes it a really strong card.

Before that was arguably Amonkhet (2017) but that was also the entire Gatewatch's idea so I feel blaming him specifically is a bit much. So Jace messes something up every 4-5 years but also does a lot of useful things in the mean time (helping win War of the Spark, helping with the Phyrexians).",

And of course it's a cast trigger, so a counterspelled Ugin still gets you a removed threat for your trouble. Even if you're not into a colorless strategy, you could just run him as an overcosted removal piece if, say, you're a Dimir deck needing enchantment and artifact removal.
