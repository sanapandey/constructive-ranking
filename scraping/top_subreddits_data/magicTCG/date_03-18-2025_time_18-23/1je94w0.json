Considering Foundations is more or less an \"evergreen\" set, it makes sense that stronger versions of similar cards are in rotating sets. If the design team's goal is to have archetypes gain and lose strength over time with rotations, but for there to always be an underlying \"base\" or archetypes via Foundations, you are required to creep the Foundations cards occasionally.",
