That's true for the variations, too: Fuse, Aftermath, and even Flip cards are consistent in that.\n\nMeanwhile, cards that are a combination of a permanent and a non-permanent have all been double-faced cards *or* used the inset frame. \n\nWhen you cast the spell half of a MDFC (e.g. [[Spikefield Hazard]]), it resolves normally and goes to the graveyard. But, when you cast an Adventure, it exiles itself instead. \n\nBy using the same inset to shuffle the card rather than exile it, I assume WoTC is saying that the inset half of a card should tell players \"pay attention, this isn't going to the graveyard.\"",
