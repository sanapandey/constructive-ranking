    "selftext": "This is a place for asking simple questions that might not deserve their own thread. For example, if you have a question about a rules interaction, want sleeve and accessory recommendations, or suggestions for your new deck, then this is the place for you.\n\nWe encourage that you post any questions that you may have concerning Magic the Gathering here rather than make a separate thread for each question, though for now we won't require that you do so.\n\n**Rules Questions**\n\nRules questions and interactions are allowed to be posted here, but if you need an answer quickly it may be best to use a dedicated resource like the [24/7 Magic the Gathering Rules Chat](https://chat.magicjudges.org/mtgrules/).\n\n**Deckbuilding Questions**\n\nIf you're trying to get help with a deck, it is recommended that you post your decklist to a deckbuilding website so that it is easier to view. Some popular sites are Aetherhub, Archidekt, Deckbox, Deckstats, Moxfield, MtgGoldfish, and TappedOut.\n\nAdditionally, please include some description of what you are trying to accomplish. Don't just give us a decklist with no explanation, and don't ask extremely vague questions such as \"what cards should I add to my deck to make it better?\", because it's hard to give good advice in those cases. Let us know details, the more the better. Are you building with a particular strategy or theme in mind? Are there any non-obvious combo lines or synergies that people should be aware of? Are you struggling with a particular matchup, or are you finding yourself missing consistency in an important area, and need some help specifically for it? Let us know.\n\n**Commonly Asked Questions**\n\n> _I opened a card from a different set in my booster pack, is this unusual?_\n\nDon't worry, this is completely normal. If you opened a set booster, you have a small chance of obtaining a bonus card from a previous set. This is an extra card that does not replace any of the other cards in your pack, and is from a curated set of past hits that Wizards of the Coast has selected, which they call \"The List\".\n\nYou can view the contents of The List on Wizards of the Coast's official website. For example, the contents of The List for Streets of New Capenna boosters can be found [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/whats-new-list-streets-new-capenna-2022-04-14).\n\n> _My foil card has a shooting start symbol over the bottom left. I can't find anything about it online._\n\nAll old-bordered foils have the shooting star symbol. Most sites that display card images just overlay a generic foil graphic over all foil cards, which doesn't include the shooting star. Your card is normal.",

I'm basing my preference for red/white because I like to be able to play aggressively while having the ability to \"back myself up\" and heal or do buffs to be able to keep the momentum of the more aggressive play up. My play partner told me white tends to be more healing (although I didn't have any healing cards in the deck I played, mostly flying and mana-generation, which I didn't mind) which is why I picked white :) But if anyone has any alternate suggestions, I'd be interested!",

                                    "body": "A couple of things here:\n\n\\- \"Standard\" refers to a specific 60-card format, which only allows for certain sets from the past \\~3 years (Commander cards and sets like Modern Horizons and Lord of the Rings, are excluded, for example). But if you're just playing casually with your friends, then you probably don't need to worry about format legality. I bring this up because the Boros guild kit won't be legal in \"Standard\" format games, but it will get you a 60-card deck you can play casual games with.\n\n\\- There's an inherent contradiction between playing an aggressive deck and trying to gain life to \"keep the momentum up.\" If you like aggressive decks, red is definitely a good place to start, with either white and green as supporting colors. But life gain isn't generally a good secondary theme for these decks - your goal should be to outrace your opponent, not prolong the game. As an example, even though \\[\\[Boltwave\\]\\] and \\[\\[Healing Salve\\]\\] both generate a 3-life swing, Boltwave is the much, much better card in r/W decks. Your goal should be to reduce your opponent to zero ASAP, without worrying about your own.\n\n\\- If you do want to lean into a lifegain deck, white/black is the preferred combination. Black brings with it a number of cards that let you spend life for a number of beneficial effects, or can directly combo with lifegain to drain your opponents.\n\n\\- What should be apparent from the above points is that lifegain on its own is a weak strategy. While it might help you not lose the game, it doesn't help you win either. To put it another way, life totals aren't a score - they're a resource. Spending life, either directly via abilities or indirectly via not worrying about damage dealt to you, is fine as long as you don't hit zero yourself.",

You are not \"targeting\" the permanents that your opponent is untapping.\n\n> If so would I get a trigger for each untapped permanent?\n\nEven if you were, Desperado says \"this triggers only once each turn\".  So you will never get more than one Desperado trigger in a given turn.",

I cast [[Trait Doctoring]] and change all instances of \u201cwhite\u201d on Aragorn to \u201cblue\u201d until end of turn. Imagine further that I cipher TD onto a creature that allows me to cast again and change all instances of \u201cred\u201d on Aragorn to \u201cblue\u201d until end of turn. If I then cast [[Spark Double]] targeting Aragorn, does the copy also list the updated colors? Will the copy keep the updated colors past the end of the turn? What about if I use [[Exchange of Words]] targeting Aragorn and a Grizzly Bears\u2019 instead of casting Spark Double? Will the Grizzly Bears switched text box last longer than the turn? Or in either situation would I need to use a more permanent text-changing effect like [[Sleight of Mind]] to be able to copy Aragorn or switch text boxes like this? Thanks!",

What would you rate the condition of the card based on my picture?\n\n3. Should I let the cards be graded? Since they are not nm I would say no. But does it make sense anyway?\n\n4. Is there a better place for selling high value german cards than cardmarket? Of course I want to try to make the best deal I can get when selling them.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/784b2auxlhpe1.jpeg?width=4760&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fdf98c01967d78d91bba3ab3e5fb4820e9f831c\n\nThank you.",
