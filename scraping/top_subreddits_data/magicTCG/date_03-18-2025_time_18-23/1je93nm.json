Even one a turn is fine. If you have double strike, Jeskai can draw two cards a turn sometimes, and with Temur, trample makes it perfectly likely you'll do damage with *something.*\n\nAs for calling it bad Coastal Piracy, let's be honest, we don't need another one of those in Standard. We already have Enduring Curiosity, which itself is already a power crept Coastal Piracy, and I'm *still* sick of that card. I don't think it would be a good idea for Standard to power creep Enduring Curiosity on a modal spell that costs less, especially not so soon after it both released and dominated the meta.\n\nI think it's fine to put the brakes on a 3-mana damage-to-draw option when the same card could also give +1/0, haste, and trample, which when combined, makes it incredibly likely for multiple copies of the card to always draw instead of get stuck being chumped all day like Dimir Midrange.",

The Temur option is GREAT, but only once. Making a 2nd copy of the card not be functionally dead is huge. Sometimes you'll want to cast it for the Jeskai option first too - choice is never bad.",

The beast tokens would love trample, and Narset would love Haste and +1/0. It being modal, though, means if I get a second one I could make it about card draw. :3c\n\nI'm going to be putting new Elspeth in that deck, and I already run Kykar in it, which means I'm about to be getting a buttload of very powerful tokens with trample and haste.
