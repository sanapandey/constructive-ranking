It was never a small contingent that would have forced anything. It was the political norm in 1930s America to see Jews and Negroes as nothing more than dirty vermin, as impurities in American society\u2019s clean white blood. It was Japan\u2019s desperation and Hitler\u2019s vanity that pushed the USA out of a near neutral stance. The only reason the USA didn\u2019t align with Germany was because of blunders by Hitler in negotiations. \n\nSunset towns, Jim Crow laws, segregated schools, redlining, etc.: being entirely honest, the 70 years between 1946 and 2016 were an abnormality in the American experiment. Hell, the entire structure of Nazi society was based off of American racial theory and how it had been legally implemented. The USA was the fucking blueprint.\n\n>Mistaken regard for what are believed to be divine laws and a sentimental belief in the sanctity of human life tend to prevent both the elimination of defective infants and the sterilisation of such adults as are themselves of no value to the community. The laws of nature require the obliteration of the unfit and human life is valuable only when it is of use to the community or race.\n\nYou may think that to be a Hitler quotation or from some freak sidelined racist. Nope; Madison Grant was an American lawyer, who advocated for and helped pass anti-miscegenation laws, anti\u2014non-white immigration laws, and racial purity laws across the United States at both the federal and state levels. Hitler referred to Madison\u2019s 1916 book *The Passing of the Great Race* as his personal Bible.",

Or else they'll get simply overturned/repealed/nullified when the political winds shift again.\n\nThe only way to truly cement such anti-corruption rules into place with sufficient enough lasting power is probably through a constitutional amendment, but the bar for achieving that is even higher. And even then, we already see examples of SCJs simply ruling that \"no, that's not really what the literal text means\" and effectively neutering it (see the lack of prosecution against Trump and certain subordinates for engaging in insurrection and storming the US Capitol building).",

This is their military theory -- China somehow gets their DF21 missile and fires it at a USA aircraft carrier. The Chinese run interference and say it is a natural event or disaster and save thousands of US sailors out of the sea. Chinese nationalism runs rampant and the UN gets involved. Despite all the evidence and proof, nobody believes the USA. \"Cooler heads\" prevail and due to multilateralism, entangled alliances, treaties and so on (probably even DEI) there is no vengeance or punishment taken for the death of thousands of Americans. The Chinese narrative is believed and American power is forever altered due to too much collaboration and external obligations.\n\n\nI shit you not, this is their belief that going it with others makes you unable to respond decisively to aggression. That is why they want transactionalism, they want financial (money) justification and they want clear immediate hard benefit. The fact that American soldiers become mercenaries at that point doesn't bother them. They don't want to fight for values like democracy, because they don't actually believe in democracy.

It's always been there. Their last fight for it was during the revolutionary war. They have no direct historical experience with modern totalitarian regimes outside of fighting them somewhere else in the world. They refused to listen to the experiences of immigrants from totalitarian countries, such as Central and Eastern Europeans or South East Asians. \n\nNot only that, Americans also don't generally understand that there are different types of democracies and are constantly surprised that forcing democracy, especially their style of democracy, upon countries that lack democratic culture fall apart, like Afghanistan. \n\nAs a Czech, I might as well have a big check list, look at the news about US and check boxes every day. For me, it's transparent, for them, it's not.",

As press freedom in modern Russia has grown increasingly stifled under President Vladimir Putin, RFE/RL and VOA have again been deemed \u201cenemy voices\u201d as they were by Soviet leaders.\n\n>The Kremlin was especially irritated by RFE/RL\u2019s regional affiliates that broadcast in local and Indigenous languages across Russia and former Soviet countries, as they undermined the wartime censorship Moscow imposed after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0\n\n>Two current and two former Russian officials told The Moscow Times that these outlets\u2019 reporting had created serious problems for Kremlin propaganda, damaging Moscow\u2019s influence in the post-Soviet region.\n\n>Trump\u2019s administration over the weekend started laying off staff at VOA and other broadcasters including RFE/RL after freezing their funding.\n\n>Publicly, the Kremlin issued a brief statement that downplayed the move\u2019s significance for Russia.\n\n>\u201cThese media outlets can hardly be called popular or in demand in Russia; they are purely propagandistic. This is an internal sovereign matter of the United States; it does not particularly concern us,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\n>But unofficially, the Kremlin is glad to see these outlets go, one current Russian official and a high-ranking Kremlin official who recently resigned told The Moscow Times.\u00a0\n\n>\u201cA dog\u2019s death for a dog,\u201d said the former Kremlin official, using a Russian phrase\u00a0previously used\u00a0by ex-President Dmitry Medvedev following the murder of a Russian military defector in Spain.\n\n>\u201cIt was an outdated, stupid tool. But I would pray not to accidentally anger Trump,\u201d the ex-official continued, stressing that he supports many of Trump\u2019s actions beyond his moves to dismantle RFE/RL and Voice of America.\n\n>Russia's Foreign Ministry has not commented on the Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of RFE/RL and VOA.\n\n>One Russian diplomat acknowledged to The Moscow Times that the ministry sees the decision as a positive development from the perspective of Russian foreign policy, especially in the former Soviet states that Moscow considers part of its sphere of influence.\n\n>\"They undoubtedly caused us harm in post-Soviet countries, as their work was aimed at dividing us and our allies,\" the diplomat noted.",

It was them \\[RFE/RL and VOA\\] and foreign agents stirring things up and pouring fuel to the fire,\" Simonyan said on a Sunday evening news show on the state-run Rossia 1 broadcaster.\n\n>\"They spread their tentacles across Russian regions like an octopus and brainwash our compatriots,\" Simonyan added.\n\n>VOA started broadcasting in Russian in 1947, and RFE/RL followed in 1953. The Soviet Union had launched its international broadcasting even earlier. Moscow Radio began operating in 1929 and was later rebranded as Voice of Russia and later as Sputnik.\n\n>Washington designated Russian propaganda outlets RT and Sputnik as \u201cforeign agents\u201d in 2017. After Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, they were blocked in the European Union and subjected to sanctions.\n\n>In response, Moscow labeled VOA and RFE/RL as \u201cforeign agents\u201d and later banned them as undesirable organizations, making it illegal to cooperate with them in any way, including by giving interviews to them or sharing their content.",
