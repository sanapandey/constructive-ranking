Go walk in front of politicians' houses and protest, show *very* loudly how against the stuff you disagree with you actually are.\n\nAny small group can do this, it's much more fun to do with a group, even more if yourselves organised it. It might not feel it will move the needle too much but the more of people like you that get together to be fucking loud, the better it will get.\n\nCommiserating in reddit comments won't help, it won't make us feel pity of you anymore than what we already do, we are all being affected by this bullshit while we can't do anything about it, so your rooting changes absolutely nothing, go do something about it, you are the power that can actually make the change you are rooting for.\n\nAgain: be fucking loud, together, join others being fucking loud and become an even bigger group of loud Americans.\n\nOtherwise you'll not avoid the disgust of the world because you are one of the \"good\" ones, the world doesn't fucking care, you are a nation and everyone shares the burden, do something about it.",

Even the other protests at most inconveniences them and they just get police to take care of it. I\u2019m fully down to do whatever if people have an actual plan that will work but people seem to think these horrible people are just gonna give in for virtually no reason. You might as well ask people to overthrow Russia or China with protests.",

I have seen reporting on alternative US media. I have seen it in Canadian media. I have seen it in international media. It is good that it is happening. \n\nI have read that non-US citizens just don't understand. But most citizens everywhere have jobs, many have families, some live under more authoritarian regimes than the US is currently. Police violence and police brutality is a thing across the world; that is not to discount the role of the US police and their continued targeted (lethal) violence against POC and particularly black men. The majority of the time the military has been deployed against civil rights protestors in the US.\n\nI saw in a crafting group today that a person recommended another person take PTO to grieve the death of a YT content creator, while in other forums, people claim they do not have time to protest. Maybe both of those people are GOP ride or dies, I don't know. \n\nBoycotting institutions takes time in finding alternatives, and some people cannot boycott products due to allergies or dietary restrictions. But sustained boycotting will have an effect on people who can wield power over the administration.\n\nMaking a flyer and distributing it to combat misinformation is a day or two of writing, a lot of photocopying, and days to distribute. I recognize that it is happening everyday. Pick a few salient points that are relevant to everyone. \n\nStriking may not be protected, and it may be prohibited for certain employee groups. But if enough people who _can_ do it, they cannot fire everyone.\n\nLockdown or not, as people still had to work during lockdown, the largest protest in recent US history was the BLM movement. People need to take tips from those organizers (and Beyonce) and learn how to get in formation.\n\nI don't deny the risks. I don't deny the danger. I don't deny the fear. But the US has already started to deport people to labour camps, falsely invoking an act from 1798 to justify their actions. An act that was last in the news for the shame of having used it against Japanese people in WWII.\n\nPastor Martin Niem\u00f6ller's WWII poem _First they came_ has never been more relevant than it is right now.",

This includes the ability to defend ourselves and contribute to our own interests.

The majority are Canadian truck drivers aka \"jumpers\" that bring the major loads across from the US.\n\nGovernments are not companies and I never said they were. In that same breath, the USA has no obligation to help Canadians. This was clear during Covid when they withheld vaccine and masks, and it is even clearer now. I am not defending anything Trump or Doge has done, I am just pointing out that we also put ourselves in this position.  We could have diversified and made an economy that is far more independent and robust. It's not like the warning signs have not been there.  We could have built pipe lines decades ago coast to coast and built refineries to make our own fuel.

Nothing like this happened. Our dollar was lower when I was a kid back in the 1990s. \n\nAnnexation definitely trumps \"trade dispute\" in being a motivating factor.",

As a nation, we confederated to ensure that we wouldn\u2019t be absorbed into the US. \n\nThe threat of annexation strikes at the very core of our identity and so we are reacting strongly and passionately.\n\nYour news hasn\u2019t been reporting on the threats of annexation much. Ours has. Remember, over half of Canadians have a post secondary education. We are one of the most educated countries on earth. Yes, we do read the news. And even if we didn\u2019t, we\u2019re inundated with these abhorrent threats almost daily, it\u2019s not possible for us to keep our heads in the sand. \n\nA few years ago when NAFTA was renegotiated into CUSMA, we had tariffs from Trump. We didn\u2019t react then the way we are now because we weren\u2019t told they were a strategy to annex us by economic force.",
