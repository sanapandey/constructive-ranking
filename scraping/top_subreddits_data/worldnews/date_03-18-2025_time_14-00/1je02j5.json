I think his main goal in acquiring Canada and Greenland is the waterway as climate change eliminates the ice cap. Then the USA and Russia in alliance could have somewhat of a monopoly on trade and be the world superpower. It\u2019s why he wants Panama too. I wish I saw news about this. I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s being largely ignored. Or maybe I\u2019m just not seeing it. I\u2019ve only seen it mentioned by other readers in comments.\n\nIt\u2019s terrifying. As an Alaskan, I have recently started learning basic Russian on DuoLingo. I don\u2019t think we will be given away- too many resources here and I don\u2019t think Trump is interested in ceding territory to anyone- but I can see us becoming a strategic joint military location at the least. Here in Alaska they are already talking about reopening the Adak military base.",

For commercially available, mass-market goods, sure, but a lot of military stuff comes in small batch sizes at exorbitant prices. \n\nIf it would take a million dollars of research and physical capital to cut the cost of a $100k part or system down to $20k, but you're only going ever going to make 10 of that part, the manufacturer is going to skip the investment and keep making the part for $100k.  A government with some foresight could decide to make the investment anyway, recognizing that a part that is today part of a 10 unit run could scale to a 10,000 unit run in a time of war, but I don't see a lot of foresight in our government right now -- especially where foresight requires spending money",

Taiwan will go down swinging and China will need time to recover. Same for the Phillipines.\n\nDon't get me wrong, we should really (with a level of urgency) start building our own stuff now, and in particular focus on drones, but we could very likely defend ourselves.\n\nA distinct advantage we have is that because of the distance between China and ourselves, they \\*can't\\* perform a sneak attack.\n\nSo if we can get good with drones (which is our interest in working with Ukraine, because they've been embarassing the Russian navy there) we'd probably be able to fend off China (again, assuming they ever decide to invade, which I doubt.

Eventually those three parts of Germany were stuck back together into West Germany (to be a counterbalance to the Soviet's propping up their part of Germany, and creating the GDR).\n\nThe GDR however, did not really do much of a denazification programme, because they looked at the West Germans who admitted what they (as Germans in general) did during the war and went \"See! Look! It's all the Capitalists faults! *We* the ~~Communists~~Socialists were persecuted during the War and are thus victims! We did nothing wrong!\"\n\nWhich is *why* the AfD (effectively the German Neo-Nazi Party) has much more support in the former East Germany than in the former West Germany (also the economic output of the former East German *Bundesl\u00e4nder* is still less than the former West, so there's more poverty).",

Trump mishandled classified information on multiple occasions, requesting a list of spies, keeping classified information at mar-a-lago. And CIA agents died at a much higher rate than before.\n\nI should've kept better track of sources, hard to recreate a timeline. But let me try:\n\n**Timeline:**\n\nBack in August 2019, it was reported that Trump asked the Office of National Intelligence for an inventory of all employees at top pay scale who worked there for 90 days or longer. Take this one with a grain of salt, was reported by \"the daily beast\".\n\nA month later in September 2019 they had to extract a high-level mole out of Russia, who had been there for decades and also allegedly confirmed interference in the 2016 election, due to fear of Trump having compromised him in a meeting with Russia, as reported by CNN. The CIA denied this allegation.\n\nBack in October 2021 the CIA declared that a troubling number of spies had been captured or killed over the past years in Russia, China, Iran and Pakistan. Reported by many, such as NY Times\n\nPossibly unrelated in November 2021 a White house employee flew to Mar-a-Lago to request in-person for Trump to return all documents. \n\nIn January 2022 Trump returned 15 boxes, including sensitive info, such as operations conducted abroad.\n\nTrump claimed he had returned everything, which was of course, a lie.\n\nAfter some back and forth of requesting the remaining documents, a criminal investigation was opened in April 2022. NARA concluded that a lot of documents were missing, some of those which were, as reported by NY Times, \"so sensitive in nature, and related to national security, that the justice department had to act\".\n\nWhich led to the search warrant for the raid on Mar-a-Lago in August 2022, this warrant was obtained for violations due to Espionage Act, and two other violations. In this and following raids, they seized over 13000 documents, which allegedly included nuclear secrets.\n\nSadly this case was delayed and post-poned so hard that we'll never know the truth on what documents were in there, and whether he's linked to the deaths.\n\nWhat we do know, is that he shared secret documents with others, such as Kid Rock, just to paint a picture of how freely he was sharing intel.\n\nOn February 28 2025, he reclaimed several boxes of seized \"personal\" items.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCIA agents died at faster rate, could be completely unrelated to Trump and it's unsure if this sped up the raid on Mar-a-Lago or not.\n\nWe won't know the truth until much later.\n\n\nAnd him requesting data on CIA employees happening again: https://www.justsecurity.org/107584/what-just-happened-security-implications-of-trumps-efforts-to-trim-the-cia-workforce/",

The same followers who did not believe in Project 2025, because Trump said so, by now they support it. They've perfected double-think, \"Trump does not support it, but if he does then it must be correct\". Sometimes you notice some dissent in their echo chambers, for example on taking over Canada/Greenland, but after a couple of days/weeks of foxbraining it becomes normalized as a joke, slowly adopted by his sycophants and ultimately they go through with it.\n\nTrump somehow managed to paint his mishandling of classified documents as an unjust political prosecution, got aided by loyalist judges and while he was at it, he also got himself unprecedented levels of immunity from the supreme court, which he's now abusing.\n\nPerhaps, one day, once Trump is gone, they might come back to reality, but they'll just come up with excuses like: \"I did not know\", \"the media was lying to us\", \"everything was being done in secret\", \"we were just following orders\",...\n\nAt times, I sincerely hope I'm wrong, that I'm misguided and that this is just a huge nothing burger...  But I fear things are going to get worse first, based on rhetoric from England and France, interests rising on loans due to increased defense budgets, ... \n\nAnyway, my apologies for the rant",

It is currently cold in Ukraine, particularly at night. Both sides use observation UAVs that primarily scout using thermal cameras to make identifying vehicles/infantry easier. \n\nIt's much more likely Ukrainian infantry are being spotted by observers via thermals than it is starlink is being used to target them. I also feel like, if it were doable, Ukraine would have been using Starlink to target Russians back when Russians were getting their hands on terminals through third parties last year. \n\n\nUnfortunately, Ukraine being forced to pull back from Kursk is more a matter of troop numbers than direct result of Trump admin action. The Russians have pulled quite a lot of troops from eastern Ukraine to bolster their forces in the north, and have been levelling entire villages/settlements with Artillery instead of clearing them building by building as you would normally expect when trying to retake your own territory. Russia is taking advantage of the difficulty Ukraine has with breaching and combat engineering (preventing them from making a push through *heavily* mined and fortified areas in the east controlled by Russia) to make a desperate push at Ukrainian-held parts of Kursk, and try to get themselves a marginally better \"negotiating\" position. \n\nDon't forget, Russia's lines are stretched thin. Ukraine faced almost no resistance pushing up from Sumy initially, they fully expected the Kursk operation to fall back after the main bulk of Russian reaction forces arrived. This didnt happen though, and they held the captured areas of Kursk for *months*. Expect them to repeat this kind of probing attack in other places in the future to further stretch Russia's forces.",

Am I that \"we\" and if so, who am I being sold to? The founders thought and fought for language which I now participate, so who is this \"we\"?\n\nLet me tell you something about this \"we, the people\" subscribed here in America. It is a newly-upgraded populace, now with global intelligence. Many feel AI is regional, with the old ideas about borders and protection. We all feel AI means Augmented Intelligence, and no one can restrict your intelligence.\n\nThere will always be a melting problem here in this pot. Do we have too much freedom? Part of that problem was that some people lived a different life, they simply decided how to live and that decision was different. How do I make them pay a little bit towards how I live and think?\n\nAugmented Intelligence helps here, you can ask it to replay your own life as someone else. Is Empathy a detriment or a virtue? Should humans born elsewhere have any rights at all? Empathy is knowing your part in history, and realizing you might be seen as a villain in the future. It takes a village to raise some adults.\n\nDivision makes us weak.\n\nThink about those you lost, and multiply their hopes and dreams. That is the promise of AI, augmenting our intelligence not by their slop but by their unique human contribution. We all add something.\n\nMy grandparents were raised divided and racist, because they were born white. Their perspective on the last world war, the American civil rights movement, the continuing immigration here due to our sand and current politics was slanted. Everyone crossing into democracy, through birth or border is new. How do we treat our new citizens?\n\nWho makes an American? If you have a child, who teaches them to be racist? Did you vote against the suffrage of women, should they be property? Do rich people deserve different, and more elevated rights than those struggling? We ask who we are.\n\nWe are we. Always have been, divided by special interests and their ambition, but rejoiced in the tiny gestures of unity. We never needed help dividing, but division creates an electorate.\n\nWe are the future, and the side-effects of that drug do not slow our progress. A king forcing cruelty does not make us strong. A king measures his foot, while stepping into his grave. We, as Americans, are people of strength. Eventually we will notice the weakness of division and rejoin the strength in unity.",

Its become very apparent that the land of the free has absolutely zero checks and balances on the guy who pushes the buttons. \n\nWe all thought we were friends with America, but it turns out they are resentful and spiteful. They want to own the world and they want everyone to grovel at their feet.  \n\nAnd still half of America approves of Trump.  Even if Trump got voted out tomorrow, we now know that there is a dark hateful side to America that will vote in another Trump at the soonest opportunity. Its impossible to form any meaningful alignment with America - they will turn it against you depending on the wind of the next election.  The mask has come off for everyone to see.",

But if we can stretch the war out for another year or so before that peace, without Ukraine losing much more territory, I'm down with that too. Just don't think that's going to happen.",

Russia is simultaneously an existential threat to the rest of Europe and a weak nation that poses no threat because they can't even take Ukraine.  Which one is it?  I see in your opinion it's the later.  So, are you saying NATO *should* put boots on the ground?  Because Russia isn't a threat?\n\n>No one thinks that.\n\nLook around a bit more on reddit.  *Many* people believe that must and will happen.\n\n>If we all accept that Russia will eventually attack again what benefit is there to pause the war now?\n\nWell, it would help Ukraine, and the rest of the world, prepare for that scenario.  Massivly invest in defense.  Create alliances with other countries that don't necessarily include joining NATO, but still guarantee security against another Russian invasion.  There is a lot a country can do to strengthen itself when it isn't actively involved in a war for their own existence.\n\nLook, I'm with you.  If sacrificing Ukraine leads to weakening Russia to the point of breaking, I'm all for it.  Especially if that results in Putin being ousted and Russia eventually trying to join the western world.  I personally think that end result is vital, as any country with enough nukes to destroy the world multiple times over needs to either cease to exist, or become a partner on the world stage.  \n\nBut it's silly to believe that Ukraine will eventually win this war.    They've prevented Russia from overrunning the entire country.  Having to cede only 20% of their eastern territory is absolutely a win.  So it's either continue to fight a war of attrition which they can't win, but will continue to toss men into the meat grinder, or push for a ceasefire to stop the destruction and killing of their countrymen.",

I don\u2019t agree, but i understand the sentiment.\n\nWhat i don\u2019t understand is how Trump destroying a century of cooperation between Europe and the US, alienating allies, and ruining trade with one of the largest economies in the world is seen as a good, large scrotum move.\n\n\nIt is an incredibly transparent cash grab by Trump, and the US will undoubtedly suffer the consequences of moving closer to Russia and distancing from the EU. Barring a successful grab of resources in Greenland and Ukraine, Russia has fuck all to offer.\n\nTheir economy is in freefall, and they have proven time and time again that they have both the ability and drive to enact long term actions in order to damage their rivals.\n\nHow can anyone see this as a scenario where the US as a whole comes out better than before?",
