Not Israel the state, mind you, they advocated for regular ass people to be hurt. While I do support Palestine and want the war to stop, I cannot lend my time and energy to anything so extreme. So yeah not sure if that answers your question but it seems to Match what you say: a non-zero number are nut jobs while most just want Israelis and Palestinians to be able to raise and feed their kids in peace.",

Supporters on the left are vulnerable to propaganda from within Hamas and allies.  Supporters of Israel are vulnerable to Israeli state-sanctioned propaganda.  And while we can do our best as individuals (though I think a majority of people who get involved in these debates don't even do that diligence), sometimes it's so effective that people add those lies to their toolkit without considering it could be a lie at all.

Israel was more leaning towards socialism - and its main aid came from Czechoslovakia. The USSR believed that the new country would be socialist and would accelerate the decline of British influence in the Middle East.\n\nThe USSR soon switched sides in the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict. In the 1950s it supported the Arab states, and pushed Israel away. With Israel emerging as a close Western ally, Zionism raised Communist leadership fears of internal dissent and opposition arising from the substantial segment of party members who were Jewish, leading to the declaration of Zionism as an ideological enemy. During the later parts of the Cold War Soviet Jews were persecuted as possible traitors, Western sympathisers, or a security liability.\n\nNow, remember the cold war. Israel was seen as a Western, pro-Democracy country in a region that was under Soviet influence. Just like the US supported South Korea (as did the Western world in general) against North Korea, so did the US support Israel.\n\nSince the 1960s, the Israel\u2013U.S. relationship has grown into a mutually beneficial alliance in economic, strategic and military aspects. \n\nHere's a breakdown:\n   * Israel's geographical location provides the U.S. with a strategic foothold in the Middle East, a region of significant geopolitical importance.\n   * During the Cold War, Israel served as a crucial counterweight to Soviet influence in the region.\n   * Israel is considered a stable, democratic ally in a volatile region.\n   * The two nations engage in extensive military cooperation, including joint exercises and the development of defense technologies.\n   * Israel provides valuable intelligence to the U.S., particularly in the areas of counterterrorism and regional threats.\n   * Cooperation on missile defense systems, like the Iron Dome, enhances U.S. defense capabilities.\n   * Israel is a hub of technological innovation, particularly in areas like cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and medical technology.\n   * The U.S. benefits from collaborative research and development efforts with Israeli companies and institutions.\n   * Many American companies have research and development centers within Israel, and many Israeli companies are listed on the NASDAQ.\n   * The U.S. and Israel have strong economic ties, with significant trade and investment between the two countries.\n   * The U.S.-Israel Free Trade Agreement has fostered economic growth and job creation in both nations.\n   * Israel is a large market for American goods and services.\n   * There is a perception of shared democratic values, which helps to solidify the relationship.\nIn essence, the U.S. gains strategic, intelligence, technological, and economic advantages from its close relationship with Israel.",

The latter is what Israel is officially trying to do, but they are losing their patience with all the international headwind.\n\n  \nThe situation is bad and I wish it would be resolved. I think support to Israel and especially appelation to a humane and kind spirit might be all, ordinary people can do to help the situation. But this has soured too as Israel stopped providing aid to Gaza. They were the only ones that made sure most aid arrives at the roots.\n\n  \nBut providing anything to Hamas or even talking to them is futile.
