When I saw pictures of the \"camps\" that had infrastructure (overhead power lines, etc.), constructed buildings, city streets, etc. (prior to the Israeli response, at least) I was confused for a moment. For some reason, my dumb ass was always picturing a \"refugee camp\" like a tent city in a huge open area with no resources.  \n  \nThen when I researched UNRWA and realized that this \"refugee\" organization is supporting 2nd and 3rd-generation refugees (descendants of actual refugees), it was a surprise as well. \n\nIt's terrible that the Palestinian people are stuck in the situation they are in and their only hope is a terrorist organization and an aid organization that seems wholly controlled by the terrorists.",

In the case of Palestine, the UNRWA has been the main refugee organization in the territories, and since its inception, they've used a definition of refugee that means anyone displaced, *or any descendent of a refugee*, is considered a refugee.\n\nTaken in practical terms, this effectively means that the only Palestinians who are NOT refugees are those with a paper trail proving that they lived in the West Bank or Gaza before 1948. In reality, basically all Palestinians are treated as refugees, even if they're 3 or 4 generations in having been born and raised in the \"camps\".\n\nThat being said, *outside* of Palestine, the refugee camps are much more akin to what you'd typically think, though that's almost entirely within Jordan, who has been giving back the citizenship they rescinded in 1988.",

Of course Hamas would constantly infiltrate and try to infiltrate the main source of prestige, power and money.

Israel has been relentlessly killing civilians for the last 2 months despite it. Please explain your logic about which party here is using war and killing as a political tool when Hamas is literally **still** maintaining that it will continue to honor the ceasefire despite today's horrific attacks.\n\nFamilies of hostages have stated that they do not want an escalation of the war, exactly to avoid the \"inadvertent\" killing of said hostages by Israel. Today, they killed 400 people, countless of which were children. How many children blown to bits will be the limit where the line is finally crossed for you? Give me a number; where's your red line? Do you have any? Is no amount of civilian deaths too many for you?",

That, for you, would be a completely acceptable solution? Killing tens of thousands of kids to kill a handful of terrorists is fine? Because even a single standing Hamas member in a crippled, occupied, and completely destroyed Gaza is enough of a threat to a state backed by the most powerful military in the world that it's better to just flatten the whole damn thing?\n\nGiven how absolutely awfully unprecise their *special military operations* are, it's almost starting to sound like it's Hamas who's the collateral damage and the civilians are the actual targets. But that would constitute terrorism and war crimes, of course. Israel would never do that.\n\n> They should avoid civilian casualties as much as possible, but when Hamas literally hides below hospitals they have to sometimes take drastic measures.\n\nWhy do they have to take drastic measures? How about abiding by the ceasefire agreement instead, as Hamas has done? How many Israeli civilians has Hamas killed since the ceasire? How many civilians has Israel killed?\n\nBut thanks for answering the question honestly: for you, there is no ratio. Any number of civilian deaths are apparently acceptable to eliminate a single terrorist. No human cost is too high to achieve this (moral) ideological goal? I don't know exactly what your definition of terrorism is, but to me, that's starting to sound oddly much like terrorism as well. Apparently, no amount of death and destruction is too much to advance what is supposedly a \"moral\" cause.\n\n> Which humanitarian aid organizations are independent?\n\nAny and all which are not directly tied to a state or government, and which are governmed only the members of the organization and not be state actors? Do I really need to explain what independent means? Or are you going to say that any such organization that provides aid to Palestinians is not independent?",
