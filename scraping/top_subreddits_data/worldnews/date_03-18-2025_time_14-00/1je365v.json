Anyone who isn't a short sighted idiot or morally twisted should want these things as it would greatly benefit humanity to have no war, hunger, disease, whatever obviously.\n\nHowever the people you're responding to though are pointing out it's completely empty words to say you want to eradicate hunger or disease - fantastic thing, but you can say it all you want there are multiple factors that just aren't something you can do.\n\nLike eradicating disease would actually be hilarious to say really. How are you dealing with all animal or fungus diseases? When they mutate? Etc. Etc. I'm pretty sure eradicating disease is pretty much legitimately impossible.\n\nDisarming the Earth is similar. You're asking someone out there to nicely not break the rules and make illegal weapons to take over their now defenseless neighbors out of greed. The Earth being armed is both a consequence of people's greed and people needing to defend from that - if you can't remove the element of human greed here, you can't solve war. And then how do you police it if it happens if the Earth is disarmed? By a big armed neutral force? What prevents them from being corrupt and just ruling Earth by the exact people you're trying to stop?\n\nWe can't even solve hunger in just the US because people can't handle their tax dollars going to someone less fortunate than them and billionaires would rather horde money then help others. And that's infinitely more solveable, we could solve that - and world hunger in general really - right now if we wanted. Yet because of human selfishness we do not.\n\nSo if you can't actually solve those things, is it even a goal anymore? It's just a dream. Which if you want to be positive and hopeful while working towards doing the best you can? Great. Fantastic goal.\n\nThe Pope here is just saying something though.

But its also objectively true that they dont just freely give to all types of people or organizations. They use their charitable acts to force their will on people even when it is not in anyones best interests. \n\nOne major example: the catholic church controls most adoption that occurs in the US. So they do care for a lot of orphaned/foster kids. But they also refuse to allow any of them to be adopted into loving families if the two parents are an LGBTQ couple. So they are actively keeping kids from having loving homes, actively keeping people who want to adopt from having kids, and quite frankly (from what we know about tendencies in religious organizations) putting a lot of those kids at risk of abuse by keeping them under their thumb. \n\nI would be more than happy to let the catholic church or any other religious organization continue to be tax free so long as their organizations are not allowed to force religious perspectives through their charity work. They should have to abide by some degree of faith-blind charity work, and not be allowed to discriminate. \n\nIts not like if they run a food bank they will only feed catholic converts. But a lot of their charity work runs dangerously parallel to that as an analogy",

You can't have everything else that comes along with sentience and not have the capacity for conflict.\n\nThe only way you eliminate conflict and war entirely is if literally every human being on the planet thinks and believes the exact same things. We would need to be a full blown hive mind species.\n\nIn other words, you want to get rid of war and conflict entirely? Okay, but it will cost you literally everything that makes you unique and distinct. Would you be willing to pay that price? I wouldn't. I suspect most people wouldn't.\n\nSo it isn't about transcending conflict or achieving some elevated state where we just bypass violence entirely. It's about accepting and facing that demon for what it is and doing our best to contain and control it.",

A result that nobody wanted. We were lucky so far, but our luck will eventually run out. Humanity can't survive nukes in the long run. We eventually have to get rid of them or they will, by insanity or accident, get rid of us. They are a time bomb - we just don't know how long we have until it goes off.\n\nGetting back to guns. Must are useless, lue around in a safe and never get used. But since fraction eventually hurts or kills somebody. And it's more likely to be an unintended target, often among family, friends or neighbors that it was supposed to protect, rather than the imaginary murderous burglar gang that lives in people's fantasy.\n\nThere's statistics saying that many suicides are a momentary thing. A lot of people don't do other attempts. So a gun making suicide easy in a particularly bad hour in a person's life can make the difference between death and decades if life - just because a gun was there a d the hurdle to stab yourself is higher than shooting yourself.\n\nIf a couple of guys stop after a road rage incident, an easily available gun can absolutely make the difference between somebody getting killed and a couple idiots punching each other a couple of times.\n\nA lot of guns get used  in situations where there was no will to kill somebody. That's why the he-could-have-foumd-a-different-way just doesn't applying many situations.\n\nYes, a murderous murder acting with murderous intent can use a knife or car or whatever tool to commit murder instead. But a lot of people die from weapons where nobody originally had murderous intent and in hindsight wished it didn't happen.\n\nWeapons create deathly opportunities that don't exist without them.\n\nAnd that's why it's not just about the will of the person pulling the trigger. For a 3 year old shooting his mom, the gun made all the difference. Gun exists: Mom dead, kid traumatized forever. No gun: Played with phone instead. \n\nDude watched too much Fix News about gangs murdering people in their houses, son climbs through window because he just key and didn't want to wake dad: Son dead, because gun was available. Without gun: Barricade bedroom door, call police. Make another embarrassed call about son sneaking in - family saved by absence of gun.\n\nYes, a gun needs somebody to pull a trigger - but that somebody doesn't have to have murderous intent to pull that trigger. Guns do kill people, even if they need the help of imperfect people to do so. Given that imperfect describes 100% of people, those are not great odds.",
