Russia is paranoid Europe will split it into pieces as any decent regime cannot guarantee affiliation to central power.

They have a lot of land and resources yes, but it's extremely difficult for them to get their resources to market when so many of them are locked up in Taiga and they have very few navigable rivers and winter ports. They also have extremely indefensible land; basically just gigantic wide open plains. As a result they have pursued an imperialist strategy because pushing their borders outwards actually shrinks the size of the borders they need to defend, and allows them to defend mountain passes instead of wide plains, and also gives them expendable vassal territories to absorb the impact of enemy invasions. This strategy made perfect sense until the advent of nuclear weapons. Of course now it's pretty obsolete, but cultures change slowly and Russia has a lot of cultural memory of how to maintain the core Russian territory in security and prosperity at everyone else's expense, and they never had any real competitive advantage in the modern economy without their more developed European holdings, both to do the technical work and as a market for their raw resources.",

Ukraine's successes both prove the effectiveness and ultimate demise of drone warfare.\n\nPart of why Ukraine has been as successful as it has been is because Russia has been slow to adapt to the use of drones, mostly because they lack the savvy, necessary tools, or freedom in leadership to innovate on the fly.  That said, when things like *nets* can be effective countermeasures to FPV drones, it's hard to imagine Ukraine's successes being repeated against a more capable military.\n\nBasically, the use of drones is a niche application in warfare and has limited use.  It seems unrealistic to think of it as the future of warfare.\n\n...and a little back-tracking for honesty: seemingly small innovations in war have had monumental impact before.  The Greeks' use of underwater rams on their triremes and hoplite \"shield wall\" formations with long spears effectively broke the Persian Empire and allowed that Macedonian upstart (and his more famous kid) to conquer much of the known world.  In turn, a better sense for logistics and swapping out those cumbersome spears for javelins and short swords gave the Romans the military edge.  Canned food and the ability to attack with a massive army all at once gave Napoleon his fame, and so on.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is I'm willing to be wrong; I just don't want Ukraine's success on the battlefield to become an interesting quirk lost in the footnotes of history.",

I have memories of instability: the Watergate hearings on TV; although, I didn't understand what it meant. I remember OPEC and the oil embargo with pictures of lines at the gas station, civil defense drills, the dread of Reagan winning in 1980 and the invasions of Grenada, Panama and funding the \"Contras\" in Nicaragua, Ruzzians in Afghanistan, the \"Moral Majority\".\n\nWe didn't have the security of the boomer youth or the threat of being drafted for Vietnam, or the later zeitgeist of the jingoistic Reagan era. We did have the constant background threat of nuclear war - like The Day After TV movie. That pervasive sense of doom diminished in the latter half of the 1980's.\n\nSo my vote is always for stability and a sane economic policy.",

Even writing this comment, I find myself trying to be careful. The situation feels unclear. Am I over reacting? Is this actually the end of American democracy? Is the algorithm and bot army influencing me more than I know? There's a lot of uncertainty, and I think a lot of people are uncertain about just how bad this actually is.\n\n\n\n\nBut suppose tomorrow we wake up to verifiable news that the US government is rounding up good, law abiding, American citizens and sending them to prison/work camps. A lot of that uncertainty goes away. And I think all it really takes is one person to decide to fight back. And if others notice, that spreads.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHistory is full of events like this. Very few people want to be part of a violent revolution, and yet they seem to happen all the time. I don't think anything has particularly changed in humanity or in Western society that would prevent it from happening again, if the conditions are right.\n\n\n\n\nAnd I'm not saying conditions *are* right. I'm just saying there are 340M Americans, and I wouldn't rule out the possibility that some of your fellow citizens might disagree with you.",

His market is gone because of Tarrifs. He can't pay his bills because the government refuses to pay out the grants they had previously promised, and that he's already used for equipment. He cant pay the few remaining legal employees he has left. He's going to lose his farm.\n\n\n\n\nHe goes online and gets sucked into a bunch of conspirstorial muck, and decides he needs to do something about to \"save his country\". So goes and does some targeted violence.\n\n\n\n\nA small group of lunatics who were sitting on the sidelines just waiting for this to happen jump in to join the madness. A bunch of people from the MAGA side decide they need to stand up for the country and start organising against them. And things spiral and quickly devolve.\n\n\n\n\nI'm not predicting it.

Moscow subway system doubles as a nuclear shelter. and the famous Dead Hand system is still functioning.\n\nalso, a major design flaw in cruise missiles is deep reliance on GPS guidance. good luck asking Trump for permission to use the GPS tracking service in the Moscow region. the EU's satellite system can be provided for military use, but that is gonna bring EU into a war with Russia, which it does not want.",
