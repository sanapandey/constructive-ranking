At the end of the day, oil is essential to modern living so countries will buy it be it directly or indirectly - just dont be sanctimonious hypocrite. \n\n> you can't flip a switch and turn off your lifeline of oil and gas.\n\nThing is the EU and allies need to put their money where their mouth is, you cant switch now, but if you want to switch at some point fund it now. Fund mass switching to greener tech like solar, nuclear, etc",
