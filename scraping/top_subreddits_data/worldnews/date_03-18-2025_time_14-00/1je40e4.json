Upon questioning doctors with lots of experience none could say this was something they have ever witnessed adding further doubt it was possible a rapist would have ignored a tampon.\n\nThe victim claims she now needs to be on disability support because she's trained to work in beauty and you can't keep that career if you're not confident and happy. \n\nEither Conor and the 2nd man are lying, since their stories make sense, and they are also insanely stupid criminals who didn't do much at all to protect themselves from the obvious fallout, or they are being falsely accused by the victim?\n\nSomeone is going crazy or being dishonest in this story and I find it hard to believe it's two people vs. 1? \n\nIt would be interesting if someone suddenly came forward with proof that the victim was temporarily drugged and someone else raped her. But how would you explain installing a tampon and her forgetting Lawrence had sex with her after McGregor? Thus the only likely explanation is 2 people lying or 1 person going crazy?\n\nI guess that's why she was only able to win a civil suit?",

However, that doesn't mean risks don't exist, or that we shouldn't strive for greater transparency. My questions center on the specific technologies used, the adjuvants, and the potential for long-term effects.\n\nAsking for more information isn't 'anti-vax.' It's advocating for informed consent.

While some had spent all of their meager savings to pay for passage across the Atlantic, others had their voyages funded by British landlords who found it a cheaper solution to dispatch their tenants to another continent, rather than pay for their charity at home.\n\nAnd in the opinion of many Americans, those British landlords were not sending their best people. These people were not like the industrious, Protestant Scotch-Irish immigrants who came to America in large numbers during the colonial era, fought in the Continental Army and tamed the frontier. These people were not only poor, unskilled refugees huddled in rickety tenements.
