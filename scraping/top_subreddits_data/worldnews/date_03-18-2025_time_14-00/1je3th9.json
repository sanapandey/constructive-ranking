I was teaching politics in the US in 2015 and noticed rhetoric from all the prospective Republican candidates that conformed *precisely* to notes I had on rhetoric from the lead-up to multiple genocides. It was only then that I noticed the grooming process, which is how I see it, but for it to have got that far already, I knew I was late in noticing. 50 years sounds like around what it takes, and certainly there are seeds one can see through the benefit of hindsight in the 1980s.\n\nThe dirtiest secret of genocide (and I do see something like that on the horizon, though perhaps not against a genos in the strictest sense) is that we wouldn't even need a word for it but for the active, willing participation of perfectly ordinary people who love their spouses and kids and cheer for their sportsball team, and in many contexts look pretty decent. And it takes a long, long time to groom these people for genocide. I use the word grooming because it's not even an analogy, it's the same thing: a population needs to be drawn in to commit more and more, without ever realizing the direction in which they're moving until it feels too late to back out.\n\nOf course, we normally use that word when it's a minor being groomed, and it's not their fault. In the present context, we are mostly talking about adults, and they bear significant responsibility in not bothering to notice where they're going. \n\nBut while it may *feel* too late to back out, you can always, always say NO. And in this context, if enough people say no, the event will not take place. Remember, without the active participation of ordinary people, we don't even need the word \"genocide.\"",

He\u2019s really good at amplifying and reflecting a collective main character syndrome that\u2019s already there. And because of the singing in the shower effect a really huge amount of us are literally unable to view how this makes us look from the outside. So we loose the sanity check that comes from shame on the global stage. Trump is much more travelled and worldly than most of us, not to mention he has personal relationships with all these foreign leaders. When he says that the country is respected and admired under his leadership but a laughingstock under Biden, a lot of people just assume he\u2019d know better than they would.",

After all, it was founded and still owned by a guy who made it his life's goal to put a \"conservative spin\" on the news after watching how people reacted to *the truth* about Nixon's Watergate scandal.  What surprises me is how much people who watch it don't see it for the blatant propaganda that it is.

It remains the main threat to Europe.\n\nChina however is currently no military threat, in fact they are building soft power across the globe while the US squandered it.

This could limit the course of various judicial actions to friendly courts.\n\nSteven Miller yesterday gave away perhaps their largest strategy for nullifying the courts:\n\nHe noted that there is no judicial review for actions taken by the POTUS in the capacity of Commander in Chief (using the example that even the Supreme Court has no say over troop movements and international affairs).\n\nSo you keep using your Federalist lawyers (many of which are very adroit and knowledgable) to create these edge cases that you feed up to the Supreme Court until you get rulings that carve out a segment of Executive action that is untouchable by the court (under the guise of acting as Commander in Chief and on international affairs).\n\nThen, once that leg work is done and you use the Insurrection Act to begin using your powers as Commander in Chief domestically you are carving out your ability to have extrajudicial enforcement actions that bypass due process on U.S. citizens.\n\nThat's why they tested this El Salvador thing AS WELL AS the green card holding student expressing their freedom of speech (since they have the same rights as a U.S. citizen).\n\nTo me, this all indicates that they know EXACTLY what they are doing and they are setting up the specific scenarios they need to carve their way to the end goal of extrajudicial (no due process) enforcement actions.\n\nThis even ignores the fact that they've fired all the JAGs in the military and Project 2025s plans for replacing fired federal employees at every level with registered loyalists who will break the law because they'll get pardoned.\n\nThere is a coherent, exquisitely layered and nuanced plan and I think a lot of people, even knowledgable lawyers like yourself, are just missing a number of puzzle pieces and a bit hopeful due to the 1st terms incompetence. They had 4 years and a very methodical plan from day 1 this time and from everything I've seen that plan is going off perhaps even better than they'd imagined.\n\nI appreciate your participation and feedback. I do find it illuminating and would love any inputs on why you're more confident besides the audaciousness of hope and America's complicated history. In terms of science and logic, just because every other example worked out doesn't mean the next unheralded test will. That's often a pervasive cultural meme (as Richard Dawkins defined memetics, sorry my degree is Biology/Chemistry) that empires/civilizations experience at their peak due to having no counter examples yet).",
