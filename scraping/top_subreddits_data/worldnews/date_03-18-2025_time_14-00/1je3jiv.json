It's sad, but a shocking amount of people are entirely okay with Trump. The media has done a specular job of sane washing his stupidity, racism, and sexism. If you quote exactly what he says, people will just say that's not what he meant. \n\n\nBut I do agree that much like with Hillary, Harris didn't distance herself enough from the current/past admin to really get voters out or excited. And while the economic situation wasn't great, the perception of how bad things were was wildly blown out of proportion by right wing media. Look at egg prices as an example. They beat the drum 24/7 about how it was Biden's/Harris' fault. Soon as Trump was in office, suddenly there is a list of excuses why it's not Trump's fault, telling people to stop whining, and that economic difficulty is necessary sometimes. Quite the change of tune from the \"we will fix this day 1\" side. But that kind of stupid optimism and naivety sold like hotcakes to the ignorant masses.",

Among the **targets attacked were terrorist cells, launch sites, weapons and additional military infrastructure** used by the terrorist organizations to plan and carry out terrorist acts, and which posed a threat to IDF forces and Israeli citizens, according to the IDF.\n\nIt would have been great if Hamas had honored the deal, but if they geared up again under false pretenses, I certainly understand that the IDF won't let it stand. They can't allow Hamas fighters to restock and recover, or the fighting will drag on forever.\n\nThe safest way to end the fighting is taking away Israels pretense to interfere in Gaza, which means releasing the remaining hostages - or at least being transparent about it, when you cannot identify their locations anymore. It baffles me that the Hamas still refuses to release the remaining hostages. I guess they have seen and heard things, that will result in them never making it out of captivity alive. Israel knows, the Hamas knows - and yet, the Hamas is just trying to drag it out as long as they can, before their leaders are ready to accept the bill for their pogrom against on Israel on 07.10.2023.",

And understand: I get the tactical advantage of shooting first. But that doesn't change the fact that Israel made the choice to do so. They chose.

Hamas declared war against Israel by invading and massacring thousands of its civilians\n\n2. Israel responded to this declaration of war by fighting a war.\n\n3. Wars don\u2019t end until one side surrenders, which Hamas hasn\u2019t done yet. Therefore, Israel is going to keep fighting. \n\nAgain, I don\u2019t know where you got this delusional idea that Israel is obligated to just stop fighting for no fucking reason. If Hamas wants the fighting to stop, they can do so by surrendering or agreeing to further concessions in exchange for the cease-fire to be extended. \n\nThey\u2019re obviously not going to let their enemy sit there, recuperate, strategize, and re-arm in exchange for literally nothing, no army in human history would do that. \n\n>Sorry, let me be more clear: I\u2019d settle for Israel not killing random civilians on purpose and with the clear intention of killing random civilians.\n\nIdk where the \u201cclear intention of killing random civilians\u201d is coming from, Israel stated they were going after military targets.\n\nNow obviously you\u2019re not gonna believe them which is fine. Unfortunately, this obfuscation is very easy when one side operates exclusively out of civilian infrastructure and refuses to wear uniforms or do anything else to designate valid military targets or otherwise separate combatants from civilians. \n\nSo what you\u2019d \u201csettle for\u201d is a traditional war, which I\u2019m sure Israel would be more than happy to fight, but unless Hamas decides to adopt a military strategy that isn\u2019t one never ending war crime designed to maximize the suffering of its people, then there isn\u2019t another way to fight this war.",

Why does Israel have to play Hamas' games?\n\n> And, hey, don't get me wrong: I understand the desire to go all scorched earth on terrorists. But Israel specifically is killing an absolutely indefensible number of civilians. So from where I'm sitting, I just see two groups of terrorists.\n\nThat's morally lazy.

Sounds like you think Israel isn\u2019t allowed to fight if any civilians might die, which means they\u2019re not allowed to fight or defend themselves at all given how Hamas fights and stores their weapons.\n\nHell, on October 7th, civilians joined in the massacre making themselves combatants, legally, despite being in civilian clothing. And how do you know how many civilians are dead? It\u2019s very difficult to estimate, given that Hamas doesn\u2019t differentiate (specifically to muddy the waters) and they use child soldiers as well as women fighters, who are all assumed to be civilians in the counts. Some of those women and children (especially the teenagers age 15-19, in the US 18-19 wouldn\u2019t be counted as children) are actually combatants, and still it\u2019s the lowest ratio of of civilians to combatants.\n\nIf your standards are different for Israel than other countries, especially the US in our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, then you have to ask yourself why.",

Would I have prosecuted it the same way? No. But the territory has been ruled by Hamas since Israel withdrew in a land-for-peace deal. Was there peace? No, there was war starting the very next year, terrorist attacks, rockets being fired at civilians on the regular. All Hamas understands is strength and action and they actually desire death, destruction, and believe that they benefit from civilian deaths. I wish Israel could just ignore Gaza and go home but October 7 showed that Gaza is an immediate threat to Israel even if Israel leaves it alone, even if Israel provides power and water and buildings and a guest worker program and the people on the Israel side are peace activists who try to make friends with their neighbors across the border.

Israel is responsible for protecting it's people, soldiers included which is why they like just about every modern military uses drone and air coverage before sending in foot soldiers.

The only credibility being destroyed is your own.\n\nEdit since apparently I'm blocked from replying to u/welltechnically7 :\n\n>There aren't better alternatives, though they still take them with a grain of salt. \n\nIsraeli Intelligence considers their numbers to be generally accurate. Either way, you could halve the number of claimed deaths in these airstrikes and it would still be a tragedy.\n\n>If someone tells you that they want to break into your house to kill your family, stopping him prior to that is self-defense, even if he wants to temporarily put his plan on hold\n\nIronically similar rhetoric is used on the Palestinian side. Putting aside who each of us thinks is more correct in their assessment, the fact that Israel violated the terms they themselves agreed to and signed is not a step towards peace and security in the region and will only harm any future diplomatic efforts.\n\n>Considering Hamas announced that the strikes killed a large number of senior Hamas personnel, I wouldn't say that this is indiscriminate. There's also no evidence that this location in particular is the location of the hostages.\n\nBut there's also no evidence they're not. The fact is also that Israel has some of the most advanced intelligence and military technology in the world. Putting aside the ceasefire violation, I just find it hard to believe that if the target were truly just a few Hamas officials, that these massive bombing runs are the only recourse they have.

WWI had a 1:1 ratio. Most modern wars have a ratio of  around 1:1. A ratio of 2:1 is nothing to brag about. Also most sources are stating a ratio of 4:1 with 60-70% of the casualties being women and children, not 2:1.\n\nConsidering the war in Afghanistan had a ratio of 1:2.5 civilian to combatant deaths, which is likely relatively comparable in the technical differences between Hamas and Israel. Albeit this is a little different considering the fucking fishbowl of death the Palestinians are stuck in, in an urban setting. I think its still fair to say Israel could be handling this with a bit more concern for the safety of the civilian population.",

It'd be more accurate to phrase it as if we all funded Russia and assisted in their takeover of Ukraine, displacement and lives lost. Would it be surprising if groups Ukranians a few decades down the line were radicalised would a small return of that loss to Russia be unexpected an outcome?\n\nI don't think it is remotely comparable a situation and is a huge mess and neither side are good people.\n\n2010s was 7.24k Palestinian deaths vs 367 Israeli. 160982 Palestinian injuries vs 6619 Israeli injuries. Ocha stats and every source has these differences for decades and decades now. It's been that way for generations let alone all the non fatality or injury slights Palestinians suffered from displacement and aid being cut off across the decades. \n\nIt seems a bit weak to compare this situation to Ukrainians defending themselves against an overwhelming aggressive force to me. \n\nThere is no good side in Israel vs Hamas as to many bad things were tolerated and funded for decades due to western interests in the region. Its totally different to something like Ukraine and Russia and I always find it a bit gross to make out as the same situation currently. \n\nIf some Palestinians were radicalised by the previous decades of much larger loss and the continued displacement and control of their people. I don't see why anyone thinks things won't repeat in future with such gigantic indiscriminate civilian casualties. Kill tens of thousands and bring an entire country to ruin just to kill some Hamas higher ups and there are going to be countless angry people replacing them anyway. \n\nSo many actions shouldn't have been condoned or funded much sooner.

Depending on what you need this information for, the answer may differ.  I.e. let's say there's a treaty signed by the country you live in that prohibits a type of munition X from being used in battle, but one of the belligerents using munition X didn't sign this treaty.  So, you, in your country, may say \"belligerent A committed a war crime, from my perspective\", but, consistent with your statement, the belligerent A themselves may claim that they have committed no war crime.  And, in practice, this may result in a situation where users of munition X will not be held responsible while in country A, but might be held responsible if traveling to your country etc.",
