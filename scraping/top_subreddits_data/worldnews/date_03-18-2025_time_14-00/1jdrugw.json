The short of it is that most small trucks around the world do not meet the fuel efficiency requirements of CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) which is great on paper to limit emissions, but the backwards part of CAFE is that there are laxer restrictions on larger vehicles. So truck manufacturers learned to just make these ungodly large trucks to skip past those restrictions. \n\nCombine that with the US's 'bigger is better' oriented culture and this is what you get.",

I\u2019ve helped countless friends and family move houses, have easily moved myself multiple times, have a father-in-law that needs help hauling stuff pretty frequently, and used to run restaurants and would have to make huge food pickups from the warehouses.  It\u2019s been extremely useful having a truck over the years.  I also used to really enjoy watching meteor showers so would go drive to where I could see them, then lay out in the bed of the truck wherever I parked and watch for hours. \n\nI didn\u2019t get a four-wheel-drive because it was too expensive for me at the time, and it doesn\u2019t have like a big jacked up suspension, but it comfortably seats 6 people and has a powerful engine for hauling/towing.  I grew up on a farm and have always seen great value in having a truck.  My dad always told me the quickest way to ruin a good work truck was to take it out playing off-road.  He said if it was off the road, you better be using it for a project!  Seen plenty of friends mess their vehicles up trying to off-road, and it doesn\u2019t have four-wheel drive, so I don\u2019t really ever take it off road unless it\u2019s to haul project supplies across a field or something.",

Its cheaper to make a big, shitty truck, than a smaller, efficient vehicle. Yes, these fucks have taken emissions regulation as cause to *be less efficient.* Combine that with a fuckton of marketing and selling these shitty vehicles at a relatively low cost compared to their absolute size, and bam, place is bloody infested.",

Instead of the government regulating SUV designs to not kill people, they let the sellers play on how \"safe\" SUVs are compared to regular cars. Only an SUV can protect you from another SUV. And for more protection, you want a bigger SUV than your peers, and they also want a bigger SUV than you. As more and more SUVs are on the road, the problem becomes a vicious cycle.

You can't over look the cultural significance either.\n\nHowever, when youre not in a major city like New York, Chicago etc everything is bigger. The roads are bigger, the parking spots are bigger, people's houses, yard, and garages are bigger. Everything people buy to fput in their big yards and houses fit in the truck and the truck fits in the bigger roads. Compared to Europe where roads and villages/houses were built and designed centuries ago they wouldn't fit at all. \n\nYou can fit 40 Britains inside the US, it's huge. Australia is almost the same size as the US but, and you tell me as I'm not so sure, isn't like 97% of Australias population concentrated in like 5% of the land or something, just a handful of coastal cities? Is there even a single automobile factory In Australia? The cost to ship big ass trucks there where they probably wouldn't even fit can't even be worth it to someone.\n\nWhen America was booming and building roads so was the automobile industry. Cadillacs, Lincolns, Plymouths, Chevys all were huge. They were referred to as land yachts... Everything was built to accommodate them. There's also giant semi's hauling shit all over the US and they need to fit on the roads too. Every town by me has a target, a Lowe's, a home depot, multiple grocery chains, car dealerships etc. All that shit has to move around. \n\nLike I was saying, in the suburbs is where most are driving their pick up. You can fit a family of 5 in a pick up during the week and still go get 20 bags of mulch or a bunch of lumber or throw your camping gear in them. Millions of tradesman throw their tools in the back and head to work. \n\nFuel prices have also historically been cheaper in the US. Plus now they build them with a v6 or 4 and stick a turbo on it, so you still get the power but better fuel economy.\n\nI don't own a pickup, but I do have a larger SUV with a 3rd row. It fits my 3 kids in children's car seats well. Last week I folded them down and got 12 sheets of drywall.",

That is unless you plan to look at every stock as if you owned those individual businesses the way buffet does. Buy and hold a small portfolio of companies over a long time. It\u2019s a good strategy, but even Buffet is holding the highest level of cash he\u2019s ever held. It means he\u2019s lost faith in opportunities in the market at the moment.\n\nThis is not a normal environment. We are in a bear market. A big bad one. A once in a generation opportunity. It just hasn\u2019t fully developed yet which means there is still a lot of opportunity. Now if I wanted to I could invest in inverse indexes like SQQQ to invest in an etf on the overall fall of the market as a whole, however, bear markets are about the crashing filth that gets cleared out. In 2008 it was banks, builders, insurance companies, and hedge funds. If you shorted those stocks at the time you are likely traveling the world in retirement. In 2001 it was Enron and tech stocks. In 1929 it was pretty much everything.  If you were one of those lucky 1929 shorts you would have been able to live a lavish life while riding the market back up with your short gains.\n\nThe point is if you see a bus heading down hill in your direction, step aside and get on the bus. Ride it to the bottom and then ride it back up. Don\u2019t do options, do inverse ETFs. Everyone is always looking at investing from one direction. When the entire market is falling, look for the garbage, the same way you look for the gems in a bull market.",

Within the Chinese market, if you want good quality, you buy Tesla. And given Tesla's spotty record on QA, I think that should given anyone pause when considering Chinese EVs.\n\nBut even if you didn't care or didn't believe any of that, and even if you didn't believe China has a tendency to include phone-home \"features\" in their technology and products, you still have to contend with the very real, well documented human and environmental toll of Chinese tech. The sheer scale of human suffering and environmental destruction China is causing in sub-Saharan Africa alone should make one strongly reconsider. My God, a Chinese copper mine in Zambia just poisoned a 900 mile river that millions of people rely on to live. And when I say poisoned, I mean all life in the river died. And that's just the latest in a long, long string of similar incidents. To say nothing of the concentration camps they're **currently** running in China, the ethnic cleansing, they're actively doing, death squads, etc.\n\nIt kills me when somebody comes along and suggests China as a somehow less evil alternative to **anything**.",
