The Eastern Flank of NATO is already aggressively rearming but if Germany can substantially increase their stockpiles and military readiness it will serve as a massive deterrent to continued Russian aggression. It will also make it easier for Germany to send more of their current stockpiles to Ukraine if they know they are getting more later on. This is something that should have been done a decade or more ago but I'm still glad it's being done now.",

Russia is bracing for some very serious problems when hundreds of thousands of veterans with PTSD, anti social tendencies and addiction issues come home. Apparently there has already been an uptick in crimes and veterans from the war have already killed or maimed 750 people within Russia. \n\nOne of the things I've noticed when studying history is that violence committed abroad often has a funny way of coming back home. Sure there are some very noticeable signs of this with the fighting in Kursk or the Ukrainian strikes on Russian infrastructure but when average Russians find themselves the victims of violent crimes by returning Russian soldiers or when an alcoholic ex soldier flies into a violent rage at his family it's also a sign of suffering abroad coming back home. When average Russians decide to just silently go along with the war and not resist in any meaningful way  they are unknowingly volunteering for more of this violence.",

The Backfire drone, made by the Ukrainian company Zli Ptakhy, has emerged as a way for the country to execute penetrating bombing missions without compromising payload. Kyiv has made significant strides in the development of deep-strike drone capabilities as a substitute for long-range missiles, which Ukraine lacked at the onset of the fighting.\n\nIn separate interviews with Business Insider, a Zli Ptakhy representative and a Ukrainian soldier whose unit fields the Backfire described the drone as an effective weapon. They said the aircraft provides its operators with a good mix of range, explosive power, and durability.\n\nThe Backfire started as a collaboration between Ukraine's military and defense industry, which sought to build something that could penetrate deep behind the front lines. The drone began participating in combat missions on a regular basis in 2023. Since then, it's been a nonstop process to improve the aircraft \u2014 from the airframe to the engine \u2014 as the Ukrainian military continuously provides feedback on the aircraft's battlefield performance.\n\nThe aircraft, which costs a little under $500, has a propellor on its nose like classic fixed-wing aircraft. Much smaller than a crewed plane, it has a wingspan of more than 11 feet and is 6 feet in length. A three-person crew can launch the bomber drone from a catapult in minutes.\n\nThe Backfire drone has a range of roughly 90 miles, a typical cruising speed of around 60 mph, and the ability to carry out bombing missions at altitudes between 150 and 1,000 feet. It can carry a payload of over 12 pounds and release mortars, grenades, or mines on targets below. The choice of ordnance is flexible and ultimately depends on the specifics of the mission.\n\nAnton Eine, the Zli Ptakhy representative, said the drone could \"carpet bomb\" Russian positions below. His brother Alex, the section commander of a drone unit in Ukraine's Separate Presidential Brigade, said the Backfire could drop mines to be remotely detonated at a later time as an alternative payload.\n\nThe Backfire has mainly been used in combat missions along the southern direction of the front lines. Alex's unit, known in English as the \"Birds of Fury\" and which primarily uses the Backfire drone, works in the Kherson region and flies the drone across the Dnipro River into Russian-held territory. The aim is to catch the Russians off guard. \"We are doing our missions deep behind enemy lines, so they are not expecting our flight,\" he said.\n\nThe two brothers said that Zli Ptakhy struck a balance with the Backfire. Some drones carry more explosives. Some fly farther. Some don't come back, like the exploding first-person-view quadcopter drones used all along the front. \"Backfire is the golden ratio between the cost, the reusability, payload, and range,\" Alex said. The Backfire is a multi-use drone. It's able to carry out dozens of missions and is easily repairable if it gets damaged in flight or during landing, which sometimes requires a parachute to slow it down.\n\n\"It's a very efficient weapon,\" Anton said.\n\nThe Backfire has been shot down and faces similar challenges to other drones: high-intensity electronic warfare, or signal jamming, across the front lines. Both Russia and Ukraine rely heavily on electronic warfare tactics to interfere with enemy weaponry like drones and munitions.\n\nAnton said that the Backfire met little resistance when it first started flying. But over time, the Russians started deploying more air defenses and employing tougher electronic warfare. This development has forced operators to try out new tactics, like flying the drone at higher or lower altitudes; the latter increases the chances of it being shot down. \n\n\"It's pushing us \u2014 and all the producers of the drones \u2014 to look for solutions how to overcome the radio electronic warfare,\" Anton explained, saying that they have \"to look for new kinds of antennas, new solutions for navigation and connection.\" \"It's an endless chase,\" he added. \"Each time it happens that someone finds the solution to overcome enemy counter-solutions, and then the game changes.\"\n\nUkrainian officials have described the weapons race between Kyiv and Moscow as a cat-and-mouse affair, with both sides trying to best the other with their war technology and innovation. The Ukrainian military wants the Backfire to have a higher payload, longer range, better strike precision, and more efficient electronic warfare resistance. It's a tall order, but Zli Ptakhy is closing in on doubling its payload and expanding the drone's range. The company can produce dozens of the drones a month in production facilities at undisclosed locations around Ukraine. Zli Ptakhy is one of many Ukrainian companies making drones of all shapes, sizes, and capabilities for the country's military as it continues to defend against Russia's invasion.",

Additionally, the Russians are employing a \u201crather unusual\u201d drone tactic, says Pavlo Shamshyn, spokesperson for the Kharkiv operational-tactical group, according to UNIAN.\n\nHe noted that during the attempted crossing of the Oskil, Russian forces could only move infantry groups to the right bank. This means they are currently unable to use vehicles on the Ukraine-controlled side of the river. \u201cWhen their infantry groups do manage to reach the other bank by various means, they are actively supported by both strike drones and artillery. It is worth mentioning that they have started to use a rather interesting tactic here. It wasn\u2019t a complete surprise to us, but they hadn\u2019t done this before,\u201d Shamshyn emphasized.\n\nAs Russia\u2019s infantry group moves forward, two drones follow them: one for reconnaissance and the other for strikes.\n\n\u201cFor example, when their infantry group encounters resistance from our troops, they deploy the strike drone. Meanwhile, the reconnaissance drone adjusts artillery fire and helps them make tactical decisions. However, they have not been successful, as our forces are repelling these attacks,\u201d the Ukrainian military spokesperson added.\n\nRegarding the situation near Vovchansk, the frontline runs along the Vovcha River. From time to time Russian groups attempt to cross it but without success. \n\n\u201cWe detect their movements in time, and as soon as it happens, we use all available means to eliminate them,\u201d Shamshyn stressed.\n\nVovchansk itself has been reduced to ruins. However, the Russians are using underground utilities in the city to amass personnel and equipment. \u201cThey like to hide in basements and various pipes. But we are doing everything possible to ensure that when they crawl into those pipes, they don\u2019t come back out. For now, the situation in Vovchansk is under control, and the Russians have no success,\u201d the officer stated.",

Russia always intensifies its attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure leading up to and during winter.

The maritime ceasefire tells us that Ukrainian maritime drones were very successful in neutralizing the Russian maritime fleet. The infrastructure and energy ceasefire tells us that targeting refineries was the right strategic move and gave Ukraine a lot of leverage. It also makes the previous hand wringing about it look even more stupid.\n\n\nA maritime ceasefire would undoubtly help Russia a lot more. I'm guessing the infrastructure and energy ceasefire will be more beneficial to Ukrainian civilians lives while it would free up more resources for the Russian. That's due to the fact that Russians love targeting civilians while Ukrainians focus on Russian's industry and Russian's larger territory is harder to defend. On top of that, contrary to before, Ukraine has the option to resume their strikes if Russia violates the ceasefire.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile I'm not particuliarly happy about the terms that are more in favor of Russia, I'm happy to see that they vindicate some of Ukraine's strategic choices. The lesson should be that Russia only listens when you really hurt them. Unfortunately, lots of people will refuse to learn and will keep trying to appease those murderers.",

Both leaders agreed this conflict needs to end with a lasting peace. They also stressed the need for improved bilateral relations between the United States and Russia. The blood and treasure that both Ukraine and Russia have been spending in this war would be better spent on the needs of their people.\n\n>This conflict should never have started and should have been ended long ago with sincere and good faith peace efforts. The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace. These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East.\n\n>The leaders spoke broadly about the Middle East as a region of potential cooperation to prevent future conflicts. They further discussed the need to stop proliferation of strategic weapons and will engage with others to ensure the broadest possible application. The two leaders shared the view that Iran should never be in a position to destroy Israel.\n\n>The two leaders agreed that a future with an improved bilateral relationship between the United States and Russia has huge upside. This includes enormous economic deals and geopolitical stability when peace has been achieved.",

Your question assumes a simple stance \"Ukrainians support Israel\", while the official government position was the two-state solution support last time I checked. Which means they officially support both Israel and Palestine.\n\nThe real sentiment among Ukrainians varies as well. Most notably due to the Israel-Hamas war not being the top of mind issue for most of them. I hope you could guess why.\n\nEven then, Ukrainians do carry a bit of a quiet gripe against current Israel government. It was slow to support Ukraine and slow to oppose Russia, even though Israeli people were asking their government to be bolder.\n\nIn general, there are Israel and Palestine people, and there are Israel government and Hamas. Only the last on that list is near universally hated. The level of support for other three entities on the list is more complicated and varies a lot.",
