The area can be unsafe for civilians for years, unless\u00a0mine clearance work is done by foot-by-foot.\n\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland\u2019s defence minister, said last May that his government might consider renouncing the anti-land mine convention. He did so while unveiling plans for the \u201cEastern Shield\u201d,\u00a0a fortification of Poland\u2019s borders with Belarus and Russia\u00a0that would potentially include minefields.\n\nThe plans are being co-ordinated with the three Baltic states.\n\n**Full story:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/03/18/poland-baltic-states-lift-bans-landmines/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/03/18/poland-baltic-states-lift-bans-landmines/)",
