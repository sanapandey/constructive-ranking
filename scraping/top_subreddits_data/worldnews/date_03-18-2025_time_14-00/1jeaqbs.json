There was enough doubt before that where he could have kept stringing them along but I'm guessing Putin is really getting desperate.  Now the EU is ramping up their aid and we now are questioning just how much aid the US was actually sending over there after the arms dealers take their 66% cut.",

Because Trump is 100% a Russian asset. He\u2019s been doing business with Russian oligarchs for decades, and they have all sorts of dirt on him. Project 2025 is a 180 day plan. Now that the government will stay funded, the GOP will finish everything in that plan, which includes as a last move complete control over elections. Once that happens, I bet my house that out comes all the dirt on Trump leaked from Russia. Trump will get pushed aside, and it\u2019ll either be Vance or some other younger person who can be kept in power indefinitely. The architects of project 2025 know what Trump is, but they also know long-term he\u2019s too unstable and erratic, and ultimately, too old anyway. But they needed him to get their plan into motion, and once it\u2019s complete, they\u2019ll push him aside. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if at that point out come the Epstein documents honestly. \n\nDon\u2019t forget, the project 2025 folks and Peter Thiel forced fed Vance for a reason.",
