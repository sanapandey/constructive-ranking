I\u2019ve seen him attempt the \"roll of shame\" on bench more times than I\u2019ve seen anyone else even touch the bar.\n\nToday, he asked to work in with me on bench, so of course, I said yes. Spotting him felt like an obligation at that point. I watched him push through his set, face getting redder with each rep, and after what had to be a 3-second grind, the bar stalled halfway. I moved in to help, he nodded, I got the bar up, and just as I went to rack it, he shook his head and hit me with the classic: \u201cOne more.\u201d\n\nSo we go again. And again. Honestly, at this point, I wasn\u2019t sure if he was lifting or if I was. Safe to say my traps got an unplanned workout today.",

It's not the mirror in front of the sinks, there is a separate counter with a mirror that's not in the way of anything so they don't bother anyone.",

Crazy fit guys and girls in their 20s, with a few older guys like myself. (50s) \nI\u2019m in pretty good shape and I\u2019m a bigger dude at 6\u20193\u201d 260ish. Couple of guys came up asking if they could work in on deadlifts, and I said sure. \nI had 285# on the bar and after a set they went up to 315#. At the end of the second guys set, he started to pull plates and I said I was good. After the second set they went to 365#, and again they started to pull plates and I stopped them. \nClearly puzzled, I again hit the 365# for my 5, as the watched. At the end of my set the second guy asked what my 1RM was. \u201c585, but I was only planning on 455 for 5 today. 285 was just my warmup.\u201d\nThe look on those faces was priceless.",

It wasn't just a little discomfort either, it was straight up painful to even walk. They were tender to the touch too. I've literally never felt so sore in all my life. The thing is, I didn't even use a lot of weight, just high reps of 45.",
