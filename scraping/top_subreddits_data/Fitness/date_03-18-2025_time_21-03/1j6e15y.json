While I\u2019m \u00a0deconditioned, my resting heart rate is better than average at 67.\n\nI\u2019m doing a mix of gym cardio, strength training and running. Running always feels anaerobic. Week 3 of couch to 5k is a struggle.\n\nBut when I lift it elevates my heart rate and then I can do elliptical at 155+ bpm basically indefinitely. I sweat, I\u2019m tired, but my breath isn\u2019t ragged. My perceived exertion is not matching my bpm. And I\u2019ve googled this situation, and the results usually are for people with very high resting heart rates because of being so deconditioned.\n\nIt feels stupid to ask, but is this just what aerobic activity feels like? I\u2019ve always been big (not just overweight, I\u2019m built like an O lineman) so running always felt quite difficult. Should I up the intensity? Or is it fine to focus on 45 minute sessions keeping my heart in this ~155 zone? I still intend to run 1-2 times a week so I do have an anaerobic component to my exercise.",

It's totally normal for your first 5k at the end to be over 30min (~10min miles,) especially if you're overweight.\n\n>My perceived exertion is not matching my bpm.\n\nYou're over analyzing this. BPM recommendations are a population sample, not **your** BPM. \n\n>is this just what aerobic activity feels like? Should I up the intensity? Or is it fine to focus on 45 minute sessions keeping my heart in this ~155 zone?\n\nYou should be running at a rate you can uncomfortably hold a conversation, which for most people is ~1.25-1.5x your brisk walking pace. Ignore your BPM, it's higher because your body is moving a lot of mass. As you improve your conditioning (and/or lose weight) your heart rate during activity will go down over time.",

I am eating a 700 calorie deficit and also started taking 5mg of creatine per day.\n\nThe annoying part is that I'm gaining about 1 lb per week still. Yes, I know its the creatine and likely building some muscle. I really don't care that I'm gaining numbers on the scale, its more that I'd like to use weight as a metric to optimize and tweak my diet.\n\nMy question is, when can I expect a plateau effect from the creatine and the muscle building re-start?

If you find that doing more has a positive ROI, then you have to figure out if that time is worth the investment. \n\nLike if you get 0.1% more gains for 6 hours more work, it's probably not worth it.\n\nIf you put in more time and you can't tell if your ROI is better or worse, it makes sense to not do more.\n\nIf you have a negative ROI, then you clearly shouldn't do more.\n\nIt's a thing that you have to figure out. There are general starter recommendations, but really you just have to figure out how your body adapts best.",

But the thing is I have college work and it's inc day by day. So, I planned to do drop sets and if possible supersets too but I found tht super and drop sets are nt tht optimal for strength and best suited for bodybuilding. So, I kinda got the idea to alter between strength and hypertrophy. I'd do hypertrophy during my clg days and strength in my winter or summer holidays where I'll stay in my home. Is this ok for minimal strength training. Also it'd be nice if u guys can mention the optimal number of sets and reps",

I go to the gym 7x a week (Thursday is supposed to be a rest day but I do cardio and sometimes do abs) and also do 45 minutes of cardio on the treadmill at a 16% incline and 3.5km/h. I also drink bare minimum 3.5L of water everyday and I've been on creatine since February 3rd, if that's relevant. I know that I'm well over the regular 500 deficit and may even be at 1000+ deficit, but I'm only doing an aggressive cut for 2 weeks, then I'll do a regular long term cut at 500-700 caloric deficit until mid June.\n\nWhat I'm wondering the most is if my protein intake is fine or if I should change it. I'm also fresh off a lean bulk.\n\nEdit: I also get 9-10 hours of sleep with the occasional 8 hours of sleep. I also don't feel any carry over fatigue and I recover just fine.",

I'm thinking about trying out [this PPL](https://www.aston.ac.uk/sport/news/tips/fitness-exercise/push-pull-legs) instead, but I go to my gym 4 times a week and Orange Theory 1 time, so I'm not sure how I'll incorporate PPL in 4 days when I usually hear about it being 6 days.

I'm also vegetarian and am struggling to track my food when my mom makes it but I'm trying to get better at that.\n\nThanks for reading",

Pick **any** beginner program (ideally from the wiki) that works for your schedule and run it for at least 6 weeks. \n\nBeginner programs are typically 2-3 movements and should take ~30 minutes to complete. It will not feel like you're doing a lot. The objective is to put as much \"free\" muscle on your whole body as possible and familiarize you with the gym, not to be a forever program. They also use compound movements that are realistic to add weight to on a regular basis if you start low, which prevents getting frustrated from lack of results.\n\nFor what it's worth: Barbells are not scary, are super safe, and are easy to learn to use with videos on YouTube. Don't be intimidated because you're a small female.\n\n>I want to grow my shoulders and arms the most\n\nArms and shoulders are almost always considered accessory work so you can do them at the end of **any** other workout. If you're going 4 days a week, use 2 of them for your biceps & triceps and the other 2 to hit your side & rear delts. \n\nUse a double progression method (Google it) and don't overthink it. Growing arms takes a *long ass time* and is hard to progress because each jump is a large relative % weight (i.e., 10lb to 15lb is a 50% increase.)\n\n>I'm also vegetarian and am struggling to track my food\n\nGaining muscle requires gaining a proportional amount of weight when you get past the 'fresh noob' phase. Until that runs out (usually ~6 months,) your diet can be pretty much whatever you want.\n\nBeyond that, not eating adequate calories or protein will prevent you from developing muscle eventually, and vegetarians specifically *almost always* need to supplement protein.",

You can throw in some lateral raises, biceps curls, and skull crushers to work your arms (I'd recommend a simple double progression scheme for these - pick a rep range, like 8-12, and pick a weight where it's hard to do 8 reps. Aim for 3 sets of 8, so 8, 8, 8. Next session, try to add a rep, so 9.9,9. Let's say you try to get all 10's next time, but you can only get 10, 9, 9; at the next session just try to add a rep to the next set, so 10,10,9. Keep doing this until you hit all 12 reps for 3 sets and increase the weight), and I'd do those lifts twice a week.\n\nedit: fixed the link, whoops",

I do have an issue where I lose count because I concentrate too much on proper breathing, which is making me realize I need to research more on proper breathing during different types of workouts\n\nThe PPL routine I mentioned does cover the workouts in the link you sent, but ofc the order is diff bc it's PPL, I do want some more variance and added workouts to the one you recommended, so I might tweak with it and see\n\nThank you!",

The bar was too heavy for me in the beginning, I did a simple double progression until I could bench with 20 lb dumbbells and switched to the bar.

That makes me feel way better about how low my weights are at the moment, I'm at 5lb for some of my workouts too, I'm definitely going to work on the double progression, I think that's going to make a huge difference.\n\nAlso another question if you can answer since you had a similar weight/build to me - how did you get yourself to eat more? Are there any methods you used to get yourself to progressively get used to eating more, or did it come naturally?",

You're at the stage where you can actually recomp (i.e. build muscle at maintenance calories), which is great! I'd just focus on getting as much protein as possible - 0.8-1.2 grams/lb of bodyweight. I supplemented with whey protein shakes (it's about 30 gm a scoop). There's vegan pea protein powders that you can take if what you're eating isn't enough.\n\nAfter the first year or so of lifting, you can start bulking - I aimed for a modest 250 calorie a day surplus, which is basically like an extra serving of whatever you normally eat. This way, the weight you'll gain will be mostly muscle instead of fat. So long as you're meeting your protein goals, you should be fine.\n\nGood luck!\n\nedit: also, you don't have to cram in all 250 surplus calories at once - you can spread them out among the meals you normally eat. So a tablespoon of peanut butter here, an extra serving of yogurt there, will add up",

If it\u2019s a habit and you skip a leg day once every 2 months, (which doesn\u2019t sounds like it\u2019s missing a ton), that\u2019s ~10% less training  which can add up eventually, if my napkin math is correct. All that to say consistency triumphs over basically every variable in training.\n\nIf fatigue management and time is a large constraining variable to consider for Sunday and the rest of the week, I\u2019d move on but keep your head high to commit to consistency. If you have some fatigue & time wiggle room, I\u2019d do legs on Sunday with a half core day (or vice versa if core is a bigger priority for you. Or both if you think you can). But consider if you have a leg day scheduled for Monday or Tuesday that a Sunday leg session might interfere with. If you do, then you can do half a leg day, full or half core, or just core. \n\nI wrote all that out not to ramble, but to illustrate how many program and lifestyle variables affect the question you\u2019re asking and many others have asked. Which is why 90% of people recommend to just embrace the skip and commit to consistency (especially for beginners & intermediates who usually ask this question). Hope this helps not just the *what* but also the *why*. Happy training!",
