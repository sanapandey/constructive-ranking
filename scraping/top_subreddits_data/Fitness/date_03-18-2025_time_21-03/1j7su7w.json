I'd try different foot width/angles to see if any feel stronger for you, and try a higher/lower bar.\n\nI found that high bar I'd always lift at the heels (even with heeled shoes) due to very poor ankle mobility. A lower bar made my feet feel a lot more stable. Wide stance would cause hip issues and narrow would cause back pain so I stay fairly strictly shoulder width and toes slightly out. \n\nA form check might help too!\n\nMy first program had squats twice a week but I stalled out. I tried 3x a week and actually regressed. I now only squat once a week but do single leg compound accessories and found that it helped my squat progression. Managed to add about 30kg to my 'comfortable' squatting weight just from these form/programming tweaks, after months of stalling out around 50kg. So still behind from roughly 18 months lifting, but better than it was that first year for sure. \n\nIt doesn't come as naturally to everyone unfortunately. Got friends that surpassed a 100kg squat in a couple of months of training, and some that have been working up from an empty bar for months.",

From your maintenance calories just add like 100 or 200 surplus of calories and make sure to keep a track of your weight and once your weight gets stagnant for example for a week or so then increase the calories again by 100 to 200. The key here is to make sure that you track your intake calories precisely and yes also train super hard with some cardio of 30 mins daily. These are things I am currently doing in my bulk I am steadily increasing my weight yes; I am also gaining fat in the process but that is the stage that needs to be gone through, you will gain fat but that's okay trust the process and go for it, train hard.",

Progress is usually harder for me to see when I'm neither gaining nor losing weight - I don't see the scale change, I don't see much change when I look in the mirror and strength PR's come slower.",

If your goal is building muscle, you want to continue lifting year-round. It is also important during a cutting phase to provide sufficient stimulus to your muscle to try and maintain as much lean mass as possible. Also keep in mind the main driver of weight loss is a calorie deficit and so you could lose the same amount of weight doing weightlifting as you could with cardio or as you could with a mixture both seeing as this is the case I would strongly recommend incorporating weightlifting during the cutting phase",

There's also the matter of ability \u2013 *can* you do twice as much cardio as you're doing now? Or, *can* you lift twice as much as you're doing now?

Skinny fat means you have high bodyfat at low BMI due to extremely low muscle mass.

I set them such that they never touch the barbell when I'm in my lowest position, but my lowest position is a bit below parallel, like I actually squat as down as I possibly can (is this wrong?). This means that if I were to actually fail, I couldn't go deeper than that to allow the barbell to rest on the bars. So should I drop it? If yes, how? Should I fall back myself instead? Or do I have to squat a bit higher than what I can in order to leave room for the bars?",

By forcing your upper body to pick up more of the stabilization effort, you can hone in on your technique and bar control.  By minimizing the arch you increase the ROM which allows you get stronger in bottom portion of the lift and potentially increase hypertrophy.  \n\nBoth factors will also lead to less weight being used, so if you need a horizontal press with less fatigue, it fits that bill.  That, plus the altered positioning could make it a good fit for someone working around an issue caused by their normal setup.  \n\n\"Should\" is rarely a universal condition but anyone that wants to work on the things above can at least consider or try the Larson Press as a viable option.",

I noticed how her core/abs looked way more sculpted than mine ever did with weight training, and her arms leaned out and toned up instead of bulking\u2014we have almost the same body type/shape, so that made me want to try it too!\n\nSince I can work out five times a week, how should I structure my split to balance all three while leaning out, toning up, and keeping muscle definition? Should I focus more on Pilates and swimming for my upper body and just do targeted strength training for glutes?\n\nAlso, if anyone has good YouTube recommendations for reformer Pilates, I\u2019d love to hear them!\n\nWould appreciate any advice or personal experiences\u2014thanks in advance! \ud83d\ude0a",

                    "body": "Just a point of clarification.  Tone is based on muscle development and body fat percentage.  There are not toning excersizes, an excersize either builds muscle effectively or it does not.  Muscle definition begins to show the leaner a person gets.   For the toned look you want to build sufficient muscle and then be at a low enough bodyfat percentage for the muscle definition to be visible.  Abs are a good example of this.   Muscle building and weight loss do not easily or often occur at the same time.  So figure put which is more important.  \n\nYou can approach weightlifting according to your goals.  You can put certain areas on maintenance volume if you don't want them to get bigger, while targeting areas you want to improve.",

This particularly happens with the EZ Bar and preacher bicep curl machine. I'm warming up with light weight and then moving to 3X10. Holding my arm out straight in front me and pulling back on my fingers for a minute stretches my forearm and helps reduce the pain, but it's still present and quite unpleasant for like 5-10 seconds. Timed breathing and an extremely slow release when setting down the EZ Bar helps tremendously.  \n\nAny ideas on how to ameliorate this? I have always loved curls but ever since this started happening it's my most dreaded exercise. I'm down to only 6 sets of curls a week.",

Getting amped up doesn't really seem to be conducive, at least for me, to getting tight and maintaining form and so I find it best just to really dial in on the setup and then focus on the pull because when you go heavy on a deadlift you got to keep pulling past where it feels like you're stuck to get the weight to move so for me it's about practicing every set the same to where you're not even thinking about your setup.

Many people just love to over complicate. Hold your breath and move the weight. And listen to your body.\n\nBerserk mode helps with some exercises, but not with SBD lifts.

Just sucks that I still haven't reached a plate yet on my bench press but slow and stead I suppose.\n\nOne question I have is I know that, for hypertrophy, we're supposed to aim for 10 sets per muscle group per week. On the above I know that I'm def not hitting that (full time job, limited time). However, some of my compound lifts would be hitting some muscles in addition to isolation stuff, right? Should I be counting those overlapping secondary muscles as part of my 10 sets?\n\nAlso if anyone thinks they see issues with what I'm doing or general improvements, feel free to let me know!",

Eventually you'll probably get into a percentage or RPE based setup, at which point you'll be creating a bunch of needlessly confusing math for yourself.\n\nIf your max is \"90\" and you're trying to do 80% of your max, you'll have to calculate out your actual max (90+90+45=225), calculate 80% of that (225 x .8 = 160) and then calculate out the weight on each side for your weird tracking (160-45=115, 115/2=57.5).\n\nWouldn't it just be easier to start writing down the full weight of the bar?",

Over a few weeks you should accumulate more reps in the amrap until it's time to move up weight. \n\nYou can also vary the number of reps in each set, like if you can't do 4x10x115 on bench, but you can do 3x8x115, do that and try to add reps over time until you're at 4x12x115, then see about going to 125.\n\nEventually you'll get to a point where you're pushing enough weight that you need the more complicated programming to give you appropriate stimulus and recovery, but just starting to slow down a bit isn't there.",

BB Squats use your Glutes as well as your quads, but then you're jumping right on a hip thrust, for example.\n\nYou can also probably throw some of your arm work on your lower days to save time (or add more upper body work.)

Depending on how severe your deficit is, shifting those calories from protein to carbs may help with energy levels.\n\nYou can absolutely build muscle on a calorie deficit, but the only people who can normally build a noticeable amount of muscle on a deficit are people who are overfat/undermuscled and it sounds like you're neither of those.",

You could go on a starvation diet with a medical team who monitors vitals, confirms you are getting all required vitamins, minerals, fats, etc and lose a ton of weight (fat + muscle + fluids). You could do this and medically be healthy, but weight management tends to have a large mental component. \n\nAre you going to be able to maintain after your crash diet or will you yoyo back up in weight, because you never made a mental adjustment with how you manage your nutrition.",

This is recommended for people who can not do many pull-ups as it allows you to accumulate volume over the course of the day.  Greasing the girrve does not require low reps, it just tends to incorporate low reps due to the individual not being able to perform high reps, which is why the follow the greasing the groove protocol.  It doesn't require light weight. Again, this is more dependent upon the individual using the protocol not being very strong at the movement, which may dictate lightweight. But again, with the example of pull-ups, with obvious exception of band-assisted, most people are doing pull-ups at body weight.  I also don't think you prime anything in any way other than practicing the movement.",

It is necessary to warm up properly to avoid any injuries and about routines I think it does not have that much effect if you are progressing on a consistent basis keep continuing or to spice things up you can change your routine but I will suggest that you should not change routines very frequently, once in a while is okay in order to spice things up its okay to do so. Just train hard keep and keep the intensity high and try going to failure, you will progress. And finally as to how to do this faster there is basically no way of doing this faster it takes time, do things that makes it enjoyable and stick to it. Keep training hard.",
