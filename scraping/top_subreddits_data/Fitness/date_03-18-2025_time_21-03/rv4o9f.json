    "selftext": "# Welcome to r/Fitness - Reddit's #1 Health and Fitness community!\n\nr/Fitness is a **self-help** community.  Before asking questions, you are expected to have made a good faith effort to find an answer on your own and show it by explaining where you looked, what you found, and why it wasn't enough.  We ask you to respect that the people answering your questions are volunteering their time, knowledge, and experience.\n\nTo help answer your questions, get you started, or help you continue on your fitness journey, we have complied a comprehensive Wiki and FAQ.  [**https://thefitness.wiki/**](https://thefitness.wiki/) is the result of community discussions on best practice, expert opinion, emerging science, and general know-how from those who have made fitness their lifestyle or profession.\n\n# The r/Fitness wiki is moderator funded.\n\nDomain registration and hosting costs over $500 per year, but it is important to us to house this resource off-platform.  Why?  To keep it ad-free and prevent any undue sponsorship or marketing influence, to keep it free and accessible to all despite any site changes, to keep it organized, to ensure content and links to outside resources work regardless of app or browser, to enable proper search functionality, and to make sure it's available during site outages.\n\n# Resources - Check these for answers before posting a question!\n\n* [The r/Fitness Wiki and FAQ.](https://thefitness.wiki/)  Most questions that people come to r/Fitness with can be answered directly by the Wiki and FAQ or by applying the information found in it.  It will always be the best first place to look for answers.  Moderators or the community can help direct you to the right information if you have trouble finding it.\n* [Searching past threads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/search?q=&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all)  r/Fitness has over a decade of discussion threads that are very likely to have answers to your questions if our Wiki and FAQ does not.  Remember when searching that fitness and exercise are not fast moving topics, and even discussions that are several years old are going to be relevant today.\n* [Google.](https://www.google.com/)  Yes, really, or your preferred search engine.  Google excels at being a source of answers for common fitness and exercise questions including exercise alternatives or progressions, meal plan and food options, equipment or product reviews, and so on.\n* Yourself.  Many questions we see come down to a matter of personal preference or can be answered by \"it depends.\"  You should check in with yourself before asking the community to decide something for you.\n\n# The Rules\n\n[The rules for r/Fitness can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules)\n\nr/Fitness is a high traffic community that is heavily moderated to maintain quality control and make good use of the resources provided.
