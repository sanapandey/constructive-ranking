For some of it, you can, if you have access to SOMETHING to load with--for example, putting a 45 lb plate on your back during pushups.  But if you have no gym access I guess not.\n\nYou can make things more difficult, that's how you progress in calisthenics; go from pushups to decline (feet elevated above) pushups for example.  Diamond pushups instead of regular pushups. Chinups with some kind of weight attached to yourself, etc.\n\nBut really, without some kind of equipment, you're not replicating a deadlift like that, or a squat really.\n\nI would suggest one of two things: either buy a couple of good-size kettlebells and use a kettlebell program, say, Dan John's ABC for example.  They're easy to transport, easy to store, you always have them.\n\nOr two: just take this as an opportunity in your programming for high rep hypertrophy work, or even a deload.  Grab a bodyweight program from the wiki or r/bodyweightfitness, take it as a challenge, have some fun, learn new things.  A lot of good programming involves block periodization, or \"seasonal training\" as Dan John calls it; it's okay to have a chunk of training not be super heavy, and instead focus on reps, eccentrics, and control.  Then get back at it when you can.",

I've been squatting two to three times per week but have only been able to increase the load by about thirty pounds. I feel like my quads are strong enough to do substantially more weight if not for this issue.\n\nI've been doing some bodyweight squats today to try to pinpoint the problem. There's a feeling of weakness and soreness in my upper thigh/hip area when I go deep. Is there something I can do to strengthen the muscles there?",

It's enough to have your feet a bit wider than shoulder width, because it's really the toes pointing outward that causes the emphasis to shift from hamstrings to glutes. Ed Coan is a good example https://youtube.com/shorts/tJYYoFzktaE. Notice how at the top, he locks out by pushing his pelvis into the bar rather than leaning backwards and hyperextend his lower back. That's the glutes working hard. \n\n\nIf you're already doing seated leg curls, you're training the entire hamstring. \n\n\nIn general, with training, you don't have to hit everything all the time. It's fine to have periods of time where you're focusing on different things. If you're doing 60-80 sets total for the entire body per week, it's fine to take a few sets from your strong areas and add them to your weak areas. It's why it's good to plan training in 9-12 week intervals.",

Currently I do 3 sets of 8-12 reps with 35kg dumbbells. However there's people online (powerlifters) who can bench press much more than me - I saw a guy I personally know bench press 120kg. However, I've noticed these guys arch they back so much and press the moment the bar touches their super arched body. So realistically despite lifting like 2x of what I do, the range of motion is like 1/3 of the range I do. \n\nWhich way is correct? Or maybe these are two different approaches to bench/dumbbell press? I am fine with my way of doing things (flat back, deep stretch) but I'm confused to how to answer people how much do I actually press as I don't know if I'm doing the right thing.",

There are people benching 200+ kg without a large arch.\n\n>Which way is correct?\n\nThere is not one correct way to bench. Different people bench press with different form. Powerlifters specifically are using whatever form let's them move the most weight, as that is the singular goal of competitive powerlifting. Different powerlifters still have different form, some with a large arch and some much smaller.\n\n>I'm confused to how to answer people how much do I actually press as I don't know if I'm doing the right thing.\n\nJust tell them how much you press. If you want to change your form you can. Typically a large stretch is favorable for hypertrophy but an arch doesn't prevent getting a good stretch unless it is really big. Arching somewhat and retracting your scapula down and back is better for a lot of people's shoulders.",

The arch helps to stabilize your body, and if it removes a little ROM that's a bonus. Those guys will do other versions of bench press in training, probably some with more ROM (larsen, dumbbell, cambered) and some with less (board press, spoto press). \n\nHow you *get* strong and how you *demonstrate* strength are not the same thing. Powerlifters have one specific way of demonstrating strength in their sport, so that is obviously the correct thing for them to do when they're competing or practicing for competition.\n\nWhat you do on your own in the gym is up to you. It's worth learning the powerlifting technique if you're curious about it. But it's also fine to bench flat-backed with dumbbells if that's what you prefer, or do any mix of the two.",
