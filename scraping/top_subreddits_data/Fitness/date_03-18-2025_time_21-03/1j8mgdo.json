I've been doing an ad hoc Fuckarounditis circuit with leg machines/Bulgarian Split Squats/Kickstand RDLs using a double progression rep scheme 8-12, but I'm getting bored and annoyed by this. Does anyone have any suggestions for a good program to follow, or anything I can do to up the intensity besides AMRAP sets? The things I've googled (John Meadows lower body, Jeff Nippard) involve compound movements that still tweak my shoulder :(\n\nEdit: found a John Meadows routine without squats or deadlifts for people with shoulder or elbow pain (just linking it for myself to refer to later and for anyone else who's interested):\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpFoGOW24bE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpFoGOW24bE)\n\nDefinitely gonna try the SSB bar and deadlifting with lighter weight, as well as myorep match sets.

Before that, I trained, but very inconsistently and without properly tracking reps, sets, or weights. Back in 2021-2022 (when I was around 17-18), I was more consistent with training and also went through a major fat loss phase, dropping from 209 lbs (95 kg) to 158 lbs (72 kg) between 2020 and 2022.\n\nThe problem was, I ended up very skinny (maybe skinny-fat?), and I wasn\u2019t happy with how I looked or my lifts. My training suffered as a result. Fast forward to now\u2014I\u2019m 20 years old, 180 cm (5'11\") tall, and currently weigh 76 kg (167 lbs). I\u2019ve been in a fat loss phase for the past 3 months, religiously tracking my diet and only eating \"clean.\" My average intake is around 2000 kcal (+/- 100). Despite eating relatively little, my strength has gone up more than it did in my past training phases, though nothing spectacular.\n\nI\u2019ve started to see my abs (about a 4-pack) in good lighting and when I flex, but I want them to be more visible, so I\u2019m still in a deficit for now. However, I struggle a lot with self-criticism and constantly doubt whether I\u2019m doing enough or making the right choices.\n\nI walk 8-10k steps daily and have also cut out a lot of bad habits and I really want to take my training to the next level and see better results, but I feel a bit lost in terms of progression, diet, and overall direction.\n\nWould love to hear any advice from those who\u2019ve been in a similar situation!

I'd shift into a steady bulk, 300-500 calorie surplus, and wouldn't stop until I was 190-200 lb. But that's me, and cutting is easier than bulking.\n\nYou need to decide what is more important to you: getting leaner, or getting stronger & more muscular.

Your body can't continually produce muscle at this rate, so if you continue at this surplus you're gonna become fat pretty quick.\n\nstart tracking your calorie intake, and aim to eat your maintenance calories to maintain your current weight, or at a 250 calorie surplus for a \"lean bulk\" (google it) to put on a modest ~1kg a month gain, which should be mostly muscle. Given your high activity levels you should eat some extra calories to offset those burned in your workouts. \n\n> I do not want to grow and be buffed\n\nYou have nothing to worry about. People try really hard for decades to become massive and never get there. You're not going to wake up looking like Arnold, I promise.\n\nOlympic athletes don't suddenly turn into bodybuilders overnight, your LesMills Core workout isn't going to do it either",

My first month of exercise I was off from work on disability because I couldn\u2019t stand up and my job is very active where I\u2019m on my feet for up to twelve hours without a break. When I started exercising I was going 5-7 days a week but now I\u2019m down to 4-5 days because I\u2019m back at work. \n\nAm I kidding myself by thinking that I\u2019ll just start losing weight without counting calories eventually or should I start? I would consider my lifestyle extremely active. I\u2019ve noticed changes in that I can walk a majority of the time without pain and standing from sitting isn\u2019t difficult at all. I\u2019ve built a lot of muscle. I kept figuring that when I hit a block on my muscle building that I would start dropping weight. Should I count on that?",

                    "body": "People generally tend to store more water weight when they become more active. Your body realises that it's actually using its muscle and stores glycogen in water within the muscle.\n\nAfter working out for a 3 month period your weight remaining fairly static (accounting for a small increase in water weight) means that you're likely consuming the amount of calories to maintain your weight. Your body composition may have changed slightly (an increase in muscle mass and decrease in fat mass). Without decreasing the amount of calories you consume, or increasing the amount of activity, it's unlikely that you will lose any weight moving forward.\n\nYou might lose a small amount of weight naturally even while keeping your diet similar. For example if at the moment you can only run a mile per session on the treadmill but in a year you can run 10 miles per session due to increased fitness levels, you will burn significantly more calories. This would be a very slow process.\n\nCalorie counting is the best way of losing weight but if you're unlikely to stick with that then that's not a major issue. Cutting out certain foods completely can help some people (soda, bread, chocolate etc). Personally, rather than counting calories I prefer to eat a very similar diet year round, if I want to get bigger I increase the size of one of my regular meals (or add an additional meal), if I want to get smaller then I decrease the size of one of my regular meals (or remove a meal completely).\n\nWith your current calorie consumption being so high it should be fairly simple to reduce portion sizes of your existing diet.",

Although I clearly have more muscle and am stronger I do have a lot of fat in my stomach. My question is would the best course of action be bulking up to 140 and cutting back to 130?

You'll need to gain weight for a *long long* period of time.  Your ability to be lean will never truly go away.  If you want to look like you lift, *lift*.",

After cutting back down to 130 while still lifting you will look better than you look now with a very high probabilty. \n\nPlease be patient with your body, it takes time to build muscles.\n\nIn my opinion, you bulked a bit fast. You went up 15 pounds in like 10 weeks. The [wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/muscle-building-101/) recommends eating 10% to 20% above your maintenance [= 2400 cal](https://tdeecalculator.net/result.php?s=imperial&age=19&g=male&lbs=130&in=67&act=1.55&bf=&f=1). So if you follow the recommendation, you should be eating between 2640 and 2880 cal per day. That should translate to a weight gain between half a pound and one pound per week. So bulking from 130 to 140 should take at least 10 to 12 week, but can take up to 20 weeks.\n\nOne point to consider: When do you want to look your best? \n\nIf you keep bulking and reach 140 in 10 weeks, it will already be end of may, later if you bulk slower. If you start your cut right then, you should lose about a pound a week. so until you are back down 130, thats another 10 weeks. That's end of July and most of the summer is already over. Longterm, it's not important, when exactly you bulk and cut, so you might consider timing it so it fits you goals. You might want to stop your bulk and start cutting earlier to look better in summer. Think about your goals and plan accordingly.",

These aren't going to get much, if any, stimulus from the farmers walks as you aren't loading the wrist through resisted motion, it gets to just hang with the weight.\n\nSecondly, isometrics are likely not as good for muscle gain as performing resistance through a full range of motion, so the selection of exercises works against you on two fronts.\n\nIf you're after forearm growth/hypertrophy specifically, you really want to be doing some combination of a wrist curl, a reverse wrist curl, and a hammer curl to grow the wrist flexors, wrist extensors, and brachioradialis respectively. The grip strength from farmers walks should mean you can use a heavier weight for these so it's not been wasted.",

            "body": "Can someone critique my routine:  [https://imgur.com/a/l0D6r7e](https://imgur.com/a/l0D6r7e)\n\nI haven't been going for very long (about a month) but used to work out a lot between 16-20 and a little in my mid-30s.  I mostly did trade work and field work in my 20s and 30s but now in mid 40s, am office-bound, 2 young kids and slower metabolism and trying to get back into it - harder than it was before in some respects but easier in others.  I'm currently in a \"body recomposition\" mode and trying to lose BF down to 15-20%, currently I'd estimate I'm at 20-25% with my love handles being a big reason for that estimation.    \n  \nIn terms of kit, I have a home gym with power rack, couple of barbells, ezy curl bar, decent bench with leg attachment (and preacher attachment coming), several kettlebells, cheapo cable kit, treadmill and c2 rowerg.    \n\nStats are: Male, 43, 1.75m (5'9\"), 93ish kg (about 200lbs), lift numbers on routine sheet, and they're not too high yet but they're steadily increasing per workout - up 2.5% on UB and 5% on LB per pass.  Only repeated weights twice (bench) when I got stuck on 57kg, but soon when through it.  Usually do weights Monday, Wednesday, Friday and rowing or walking on the Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.  I walk the dog on the beach and swim with my daughter on the Saturday but it's not strenuous.  Just came in from my longest row, an hour in Z2 and first time over 10K.\n\nI try to do either 5x5 on each compound exercise and 5x10 on isolated ones - seems to work for me.  I do fewer Deadlift sets (3x5) with only one full weight set. Am watching what I eat, and keeping my diet at about 2100cal (8800kJ) with 35P:25F:45C macros.  Somedays are better than others but never usually go over the amount.  Am using protein shakes to supplement when needed.  I also do IF 17:7 which resticts my time for going over on the calories.  \n\nPlanning to increase to PPLUL eventually but want to get through this newb-beginner phase first - and I may also struggle with my setup and machine choices or lack thereof.  I'd also like to incorporate a bit more plyo into my workouts so I can be a bit more functionally fit, and also including more kettlebell swings/tgus and cardio for joint, stability and heart health too.  Want to try and be there for the kids and keep up with them, something my Dad was never able to do with me (he was 41 when I was born, same as I was when my youngest was born, and he struggled with mobility and heart issues throughout my childhood, exaserbated by alcohol and a motorbike injury, and lack of rehab, when in his 20s).  \n\nInitial plan was from a Buff Dudes beginner workout (from YT, not their \"12 week plan\" pdf which seemed weirdly laid out) and I've added some more isolation exercises in there to keep it interesting - the Stronglifts 5x5 would probably send me nuts within a few weeks and this is keeping me interested even if it's a good beginner program.  I still am able to put on muscle pretty quickly and some things are getting tight in the chest but looser in the belly.  I've already got a much stronger knees (was having a problem with some stability before I began - and was a driver for getting fitter) and back, arms and chest.  I feel lighter, but am a similar weight to how I started, and importantly, my kids feel lighter too when picking them up. I'm also trying to be careful not to overtrain certain muscle groups too - the initial aches and pains have dissipated (triceps took longer than expected).  Not trying to break records, compete or anything, just look good, feel healthy, eat mostly normally and be functionally strong and fit.\n\nWould really love some feedback as I'm kinda going at this alone following a fair bit of reading, program comparing and memory from programs I used to use in the 90s/00s.\n\nThanks in advance. Sorry for the diatribe.",

Just remember that you're going to be burning a lot more calories during a weekend of manual labor than during a normal weekend. If you're packing your lunch, pack extra.

The best way to prevent soreness is letting your body adapt to the stress you are providing it with. If its something you only do on occasion then you are going to get sore because your body doesnt have enough time to adapt to it. Once you are already sore, using the sore muscles again will be the quickest way to dissipate the soreness",

The idea has some appeal to me as right now I'm generally rather busy and I've gotten fat, so I figured, why not harness my body weight to buff my arms and pecs up and gradually turn it into muscle in a relatively short amount of time and in a way that requires no gyms or equipment?\n\nThe problem with daily pushups as a concept is they tend to make me sore for a day afterwards.  Sometimes more.  So I also think it might be better to take a day off of them.  A standard axiom of fitness is that muscles need a period to rest and rebuild, at least after a tough workout.  What constitutes a tough workout I don't know, though.  Most people's legs lift their body every day and they need no breaks from that.  \n\nSo maybe my arms need a break, now, but I wonder, could I get myself to a point where I could do at least some pushups every day without needing a rest?  Should I?  How would I work up to that point?  Any other insights?",

That soreness, DOMS or [Delayed-Onset Muscle Soreness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_onset_muscle_soreness), is generally a response to a new stimulus (a new exercise or an especially intense session). As your body gets accustomed to the exercise, you'll probably experience less DOMS. You might even miss it and start worrying that you're not working hard enough.\n\nYou can work through DOMS, but you can also rest or reduce the intensity for a while. Progressing (being able to do more pushups) is a reliable sign you're getting better; regressing, or not being able to do as many as you did the day before, is a sign you need to rest, and it's more reliable than soreness for telling you that.\n\nDoing pushups every day can build muscle, but after a certain point you'll get so good at them that they won't make you stronger. Something like 40-50 pushups in a set is about the limit. So look into harder variations like decline pushups, and also variations that emphasize different muscles, like diamond pushups for triceps and pike pushups for shoulders. r/bodyweightfitness has more resources on that.",

I'm pretty sure I did them at least a bit in school gym class--it was so long ago I don't remember how I did, but I wasn't very athletic in general so it can't have been very well--and I've done them more recently as occasional parts of other workout routines, but it's only been a few months since committing to them as my quick and simple at-home workout, and so far I've never committed to doing them two days in a row.\n\n>Progressing (being able to do more pushups) is a reliable sign you're getting better; regressing, or not being able to do as many as you did the day before, is a sign you need to rest, and it's more reliable than soreness for telling you that.\n\nOr a sign I'm getting fatter.  In all seriousness, at the moment when I do them I can usually do ten pushups in one set, with subsequent sets only able to top out at five.  To build to doing more than one set of ten, would you recommend continuing to rest a day or should I try to do them every day?\n\n>Doing pushups every day can build muscle, but after a certain point you'll get so good at them that they won't make you stronger.

TBH, if it's been a couple months, you should be getting less sore, so maybe you do need more rest.\n\n>To build to doing more than one set of ten, would you recommend continuing to rest a day or should I try to do them every day?\n\nMaybe try to commit to every other day, or even every third day at the start, if the soreness is discouraging you. It's also probably better to do as many as you can in your first set, even if it means fewer reps in your other sets. It'd also be okay to do one maximal set, or split up your sets through the day.\n\nYou could try to find a pushup program that matches your experience level. I'm sorta decent at them, but not really an expert, so I'm not sure what kind of programming would be ideal for you. Hope this helps, though, and keep at it.",

So I'm pretty much just asking for confirmation here that for beginners, you actually don't want to isolate too much with machines because you'll want the surrounding support muscle as a whole to grow. Even if it means lighter weight - because you want to get those weak links removed.",

Both produce similar amounts of hypertrophy.\n\nI personally prefer free weights since they're more of a compound movement and you can always add accessories via machines. Besides, if you're aiming for general health, I don't think you need super targeted training which is what the machines provide you. I use them to beef up my weak points like for squats the hip abductor machines help out when I noticed I was caving in a little at the heavier sets.",
