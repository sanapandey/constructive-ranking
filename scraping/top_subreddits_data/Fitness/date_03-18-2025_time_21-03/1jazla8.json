            "body": "I\u2019m (29f) a \u201cnewbie\u201d to fitness, which for me means that I haven\u2019t lifted, gone to the gym, ran or done anything remotely active other than the occasional walk/short trek, alongside working as waitstaff which keeps me on my feet. I did resistance training as a teen, and cycled for cardio. As an adult I did around 4 months of hot yoga, but that\u2019s been it. \n\nI\u2019m relatively small, 158cm and weigh 56 (fluctuating -0.5 to + 2kgs). And body scale scans (while I know aren\u2019t super reliable) put me around 21-23% body fat when weighed first thing in the morning after using the bathroom. \n\nI have just started reformer Pilates 3-4x week, and have been hitting consistent 10k steps a day. My protein target is between 100-120 and I find on most days that I am hitting that alongside 30-35% calories from fat and 30-35 calories from carbs. When I track my calories I aim for 1350-1400 on days I\u2019m not exercising and 1450-1500 (the goal is to reverse diet and eventually be at what I see is supposed to be a normal maintenance but I\u2019m also small so I\u2019m not even sure what maintenance could look like). My macros usually end up being 30\u2019s/30\u2019s/30\u2019s, disregarding a day a week where I might have a social engagement). I drink maybe 1 x times a week, and will have 1-2 beverages max.\n\nSo while there\u2019s nothing wrong with my current physique and my baseline fitness is surprisingly good considering I would have said I was living a more sedentary life, I\u2019m really struggling with wanting to have lower body fat, and what to do to achieve this. I\u2019m told consistency, and I\u2019ve been in my current routine for just over 2 months, but if anything the scales seem to be going up, and my clothes are fitting tighter. So I\u2019m struggling to stay positive about my body image and to trust the process. \n\nI have recently started trying creatine again, but 5g max a day. \n\nAny advice that could help me here?",

                    "body": "A reverse diet typically means that you should expect to gain some weight in the form of both fat and muscle. Sometimes the concept gets promoted as a way to \"fix\" your metabolism, but this can often feel misleading once people realize that daily energy expenditure is only ever increased by some combination of gaining weight and increasing activity.\n\nYour goal of lower body fat and increased energy expenditure are mostly at odds with each other except as the result of increased muscle. Your diet looks fine, and your routine seems fine. If you're satisfied with your routine, just give it a try, and you'll likely do great with it. If you feel that you need a stronger stimulus to gain muscle (and thereby increase energy expenditure), adding some resistance training is effective but not necessary.\n\nOverall, it sounds like you're prepared to succeed. I say just give it a couple months, and see how you feel. If you dislike the way the fit of your clothes changes, you can always just walk back some of the changes you made.",

For someone as active as you, that seems like on the low end of calories (even given your small stature) if it's accurate; it's hard to imagine you're gaining much weight while working as waitstaff, aiming for 10K steps, and doing Pilates 4x a week. \n\nFor many people creatine means an added couple pounds of water weight (which mostly makes your muscles more prominent). \n\nStarting to work out again may also cause a one-time bit of water-retention weight gain. \n\nBoth of those are one-time increases, not consistent ones. \n\nAlso, what's your goal with taking creatine? Its primary performance benefit is helping people eke out a couple reps at the end of heavy sets. I'm not sure that's well-suited for Pilates-style workouts. There is some evidence that creatine has cognitive benefits for older women, though, so I'm generally a fan but for performance and possible physique benefits it's going to have more of an impact when paired with heavier lifting. I'm no expert, but it's my understanding that Pilates in general won't give you enough resistance on your muscles to build meaningful muscle-mass if you're looking to lower your body fat. \n\nAdditionally, you mention there's nothing wrong with your physique and you're surprisingly fit as you are now - that's a great result to focus on right there while you keep being consistent.",

I might use cups, and estimates based on weight on a package, but I\u2019m also aware that calorie trackers vary wildly. I don\u2019t want to weight food given my history with eating disorders, and I try to be as intuitive as I can instead. \n\nMy bf who goes to the gym more regularly suggested creatine, for muscle recovery, but as you\u2019ve mentioned, I\u2019ve had a feeling that it isn\u2019t beneficial to my performance. \n\nI guess I would just really like to cut a little bit of fat, but I should just be a bit more patient as I go :)",

It sounds like you've got a handle on things.\n\nI feel you on this, and as someone with a bit of a disordered eating past my best advice to you stick with it, it gets better.\n\nFor me, it meant not focusing as much on fat loss and instead focusing on performance - either strength or running speed. I found it much more satisfying and easier to be patient to watch those goals progress instead of being frustrated at my lack of aesthetic progress. That progress required me to eat enough to fuel myself. The benefit is that over time I did recomp - my muscles grew and my fat lowered just by lifting heavy and the natural ups and downs of eating more/less that come with life. I'm sure it was at a slower pace than dedicated bulk/cut cycles, but bulk/cut cycles mess with my head too and I can't sustain them. That's not for everyone, just what worked for me and allowed me not to be a slave to the scale so I could be consistent.\n\nAdditionally, I'm not much bigger than you and can eat an absurd amount of calories now (I don't know how many since I don't track). So there may be hope for you there, but like you said it requires patience (or distraction in my case, since my brain is not much better than a big three year old's \ud83d\ude02).",

Diet coaches are starting to recommend taking the \"maintenance phase\" at the end of the diet just as seriously as the weightloss phase, and are suggesting things like 6-8 weeks of daily calorie tracking once you finish your weightloss to really 'lock in' the new weight and prevent rebounding. \n\n> This is probably a bit silly, but how long will it be before I LOOK like I lift weights regularly\n\nSo, you're massive at 6'8\". The good news is you're going to throw weight around like child's play, the bad news is that your frame is so large it's going to take a long time for the muscle to look really serious on you. It's the one leg up on you that short guys get. Give it one year in the gym and see what happens, you'll probably be able to notice changes after 3-4 months but it might take 6+ months for other people to tell. \n\nThe good news is that literally any small improvement is going to make you look way, way better, and feel way, way better. \n\nI'll also say that you shouldn't look to instagram for your results goals. The number of influencers on PEDs is way higher than you think. If someone is a professional influencer and don't continually bang the \"natural\" drum, they're on PEDs.",

With men it's usually either \"fat guy with a lot of muscle lost the fat over a short period and looked like a whole new person\" despite the fact they had been training for 5+ years before that, or just the typical camera angles/posing/pump/gear use stuff. So don't let that inform your expectations of rate of progress.",

In general the way to get better at doing something is just to do that something more; tax your body a bit while doing it, and recover from it. You can really only improve at your ability to recover. \n\nAdding as much load as possible (both in terms of weight, training volume, and intensity) increases your risk of injury. Allowing your body to adapt is going to be your best bet for long-term improvement. \n\nRunning up and down stairs as well as running intervals (both in appropriate doses) are a fine ways to exercise. Hills are probably going to be a good way too. Those are all really just different ways of increasing the intensity. As a beginner, your best bet is to pick a program (like the other commenter said some kind of C25K program), stick with it, and see how you improve. It'll help to build some kind of base of sustained running before improving shorter bursts (3-4 minutes, like you said). Then you can find another training program for sprinting and see how you do with that.

My latest race was a 4:33 marathon in November, however in the past two moths I started a gym routine at home too cause I grew really dissatisfied with the discrepancy between my upper vs. lower body strength over the years and decided to do something about it. The thing is, I'm having problems fitting it all with my schedule.\n\nThe sweet spot for me has always been 4 workouts a week. Experimented with 5 when I added rowing, also did 5 runs a week during marathon training etc. but still, for the most part, I felt the best energy levels-wise with 4. The thing is, when I want to add the gym, I have troubles making it all work.\n\nRight now, I'm doing 3 runs a week (usually 2x1h and one long run \\~1h45min) and 2 upper body workout using my gym equipment (pull-up bar, resistance bands, gymnastics rings; around 1h each including all the pauses between sets). This is quite taxing on me though, I have real trouble to get back to 100% energy on workout days to enjoy other things in my life (usually only succeed somewhere in the evening), I feel the tiredness carrying on to rest days etc. So I thought something must change.\n\nWhat would you do? I have four main ideas:\n\n1. Dropping to 2x run + 2x gym -> seems the easiest to implement but I don't want my running to suffer as I still consider it my favourite sport.\n\n2. Dropping to 3x run + 1x gym -> running shouldn't suffer but the gym twice a week already is not a lot (and it's not obvious how long I'll be able to progress this way for) and here we're halving this which is not good either :(\n\n3. Alternating 4- and 5-workout weeks -> every other week there's two runs instead of three so hopefully it wouldn't hurt as much as just scrapping one run altogether yet still adds more rest when you zoom out\n\n4. Keeping 5 workouts a week but dropping running volume -> we still keep 3 runs a week but instead of them being 60, 60, 105min, I do something like 45, 45, 70. The volume drops significantly, yet the frequency does not. This has the added benefit that if I do adapt to the 5 days schedule in the future after the gym stops being so new for me, one of those could potentially become hills/threshold/tempo/intervals or I could just make them longer again.\n\nWhich would you choose? Or maybe something else altogether? I just wouldn't want to sacrifice too much or lose contact with medium-to-long distances or to slow down my gym progress even further, yet I see that the current schedule is unsustainable when I want to do other things in my life and enjoy them with some energy.",

Do you have time to add a fourth easy run of 30-40 minutes?\n\nFor the gym, frankly I'd just taper it down to a quick, 30-minute full body with a squat or deadlift, a bench press or overhead press, and a lat pulldown or row and do that twice a week as you build the habit and the capacity.\n\nContext: I'm currently running about 50MPW and as mileage ramps up for my June marathon, I'll have to drop from 5 days of weightlifting down to 3-4 per week kept relatively minimalist. My main goal is to hit a marathon time goal, and keeping as much strength as I can is a secondary goal. I've built this routine over the course of several years, and this would have buried me if I tried it even a year ago.",

If you don't want to squat or deadlift that is fine but I wouldn't exclude doing those exercises just because of APT.\n\nThe routine you list is such that if you did it consistently with good effort, you should see progress over time. Hamstring volume is low to nonexistent. You only have one back exercise, and personally I would prefer mixing things up a bit if I am doing 3 days /week. So for example if you do pulldown one day, you could do a row variation on one of the other days. Same with hip thrusts, you could do a different hip hinge variation like RDL or add a hamstring isolation exercise like leg curls.",

But if you were wanting to, they are a great way to build strength and size efficiently.  I have some APT going on, and I can perform both.  Obviously, the severity would be a potential difference.  Have you been diagnosed?  A PT could help you correct the situation which I would recommend independent of weight lifting.\n\nAlso note that these two movements can be difficult to learn and so don't give up on them yet. If you're still interested in doing them. I'd recommend asking other people in the gym, hiring a coach, posting form checks to Reddit to get help. Also these movements do require a degree of flexibility and an awareness of your body as it moves through space and so they just take time to learn.  A common issue is having tight hamstrings which makes it difficult to hinge at the hip properly and so it could just be practice with lighter weights and some Mobility routines to help free up your hips/hamstrings which would allow you to then perform these movements.",

But I will give it some more thought and try to incorporate them any way I can, maybe using the Smith Machine. Also, I haven't been diagnosed with APT but I can see and feel it. If I'm being 100 I might be overestimating the severity so I can use it as an excuse to be scared of compounds so thanks for the push.",

We tend to fall forward in these movements because we are not used to the need to keep weight centered on our mid line.  One of the big break throughs I had learning to squat was putting a stool behind me and sitting down on it.  For some reason, my brain understood, sitting back onto a chair but not hips back to squat.   Flexibility and teaching your body to move through space both make huge differences.  Good luck.",

And yes, your butt should stay on the bench since the objective is to force an arch. It's also safer if the bar gets any kind of left/right wobble. You can wrap a resistance band around the bench to add texture to it since bands are made of a material that won't slip, but it's usually unnecessary until you can bench a very high amount of weight.\n\nIt sounds stupid, but you won't really know what leg drive feels like until you do it. It is very uncomfortable, but your back and shoulders will feel completely locked in, and it will change the bench angle to be slightly downward, which should allow you to move more weight.",

Your schedule prevents you from doing that.\n\nOne meal per day works. Two, three, four, five or more meals per day works.

            "body": "This is not another post about how much/how long should I bulk. I\u2019m wondering how to effectively managing a \u201ccheat\u201d day in a bulk. Of course, in a cut, your cheat day would be around maintenance or slightly over. What\u2019s the calculation in a bulk? Obviously completely overdoing it will cause excessive fat gain (5,000+ calories). But where do you draw the line?\n\nFor context, I\u2019m in my beginning stages of bodybuilding. Began lifting seriously about a year ago. I started at 220, cut down to 160 over a year or two. Now I\u2019m starting to build back to 180 for the next half year or so on 3,400 calories (25M, 5\u201d9, 166lbs). My bulk phase started Jan. 17th of this year. It\u2019s going well, I\u2019m actively and meticulously tracking my calories and morning weight. I\u2019m gaining about .42 lbs a week, which is solid I guess? I\u2019m still a little lost on what exactly I should be aiming for, but I think I\u2019m on the right track. 200g P, 460g C, 87g F. I\u2019m seeing steady improvements in my lifts which is nice.\n\nOne thing that I\u2019ve specifically been struggling with are the concept of cheat meals. During my cut, I rarely ever had a cheat meal. I instilled military-like discipline and stuck to my guns. Since I\u2019m not actively competing (yet), I really would like to take it easier on myself. Typically, my meals are all whole foods and considered healthy. Quinoa, tuna, salmon, cod, potatoes, eggs, rice, lentils, fruits, vegetables, popcorn, etc... I am the type where even in a bulk, I have to pace myself to not overeat and focus on fiber and volume foods. How should I let up on this? Should I allow myself 4,000 calories once a week? I\u2019m headed on vacation soon, should I do 4,000 calories per day for the duration of the vacation? Does the grind never stop? Any and all thoughts are appreciated.",

It's less than a traditional bulk (1 lb/week), which will get you bigger and stronger faster but without necessarily being beach-ready the whole time. It's a personal decision, but since this is your first bulk and you want to get big in the long term, you may want to gain faster and see how you put on weight. It may be less fat than you're thinking. If it's a lot, it's easier to lose than what you've already lost.\n\nAnyway, you're asking about cheat days because you want to eat more. I've felt like that early in my bulks, but it can change -- keep that in mind. Eventually it can get hard to eat as much as you need.\n\nI don't believe in cheat days during a cut. But if your usual surplus is under 250, you should be okay with going to 500 once a week.\n\nIf you eat 4000 calories a day for a week where you're not lifting, the first few days will repair your muscles to 100%, but then you'll gain mostly fat. So I'd just say you should enjoy the vacation. Try to lift a bit if you can/want. Workouts in new places can be really memorable.",

However, I still feel incredibly weak, and since January I have not made any progress at all. I would assume all the progress I have made is due to beginner gains, and while I'm still gaining muscle, I have not gained any strength since around January. The majority of every single one of my exercises is sitting at the 120-140 LBS range. I never realized how much I cared about not being weak until I hit this plateau. I should mention that I have been in a calorie deficit since September, and I understand that will make me weaker, but I didn't expect it to completely stop all progress, I would assume that it's not the cut that's doing it, but my lack of progressive overload. I never had to do progressive overload because I was making so much progress so fast that I would go up weight almost every single week. So, how should I apply progressive overload? This is my current plan and I would like to know if it's a bad idea. Currently I do back bi, chest tri, legs, rest, repeat. For every single exercise I do, I always do 5 sets of 10-12 reps, never less than that. My idea of progressive over load is to up the weight on every single exercise, and to aim for 2 sets of 5 reps. After I do those 2 sets, I'd do another 3 sets of 10-12 at my usual weight. Overtime I'd expect me to slowly be able to hit 10 reps, and once I hit 10 reps I'll either up the weight or do a third set. Is this a good idea for progressive overload? Since I'm technically doing less, would this negatively effect my gains in the long run? The reason that I would keep doing 3 normal sets is because I want to make sure I'm getting enough volume in and really achieving failure, although the goal would be to hit failure on the initial 2 sets as well, however I'm not sure how to hit failure off of only 5 reps, hence why I'd keep the 3 normal sets.",
