You knew you couldn't do it if you had to take FOUR plates off after. I'm a big dude and I'm only t-bar rowing like 3 plates for reps. luckily he didn't see, but I definitely chuckled at him haha.

There might be several differences between your time and her time, for example, total time spent training, total volume, intensiveness of exercise, diet and nutrition, and recovery.  There's a lot of things that she could be doing over the 8 to 10 months that maybe you're not and then there's also just genetic factors and other things that are beyond your control. The point I'm trying to make is instead of getting dejected it may be beneficial to look at what she is doing that is making her successful and make sure you're doing similar things.  You're not going to get a similar result just because you work out a similar amount of time.  You get the same result with the same approach and effort. I've been working out for years, and I've seen a lot of regulars get stronger, get bigger, or stay the same.  We've all been going to the gym for the same amount of time, we've all been going to the same gym.  So it may be an opportunity to reexamine your current approach and to look for areas of improvement.\n\nUltimately, it doesn't really matter, though.  If you're doing the best that you can do, you're getting the best results that you can, there's nothing more to be done about it.  Not everyone's going to have the same progress and so be careful about comparing yourself to others and instead compare yourself as you are now to as you were and use that as your motivation.",

One got on a treadmill, other got on a hip adductor machine. This was maybe ~10 minutes into my workout, and I really only noticed them because the one on the hip machine kept staring at me, plus it is a smaller gym and everyone can generally see everyone.\n\nAnyway, teenager who started on the treadmill did a full workout, all sorts of exercises, etc. The one who went to the hip machine never left or did a set. For the remainder of my ~60 minutes, she sat on the hip machine on her phone. When I left, she was still there, casually scrolling her phone and looking around.\n\nJust so odd to me. If you don't want to workout, stay in the car, right? Do *something* other than block a machine for 50+ minutes.",
