The way it works is, you take a set all the way to true failure, remember that number, and then for the next set, try to hit that number again, doing myoreps if you stop earlier than that. Anyway, I was red-faced, feeling the burn, squeezing my eyes, really struggling to hit those last few reps to make 30, when an old lady with a towel over her shoulder walked over toward me, shaking her head, and patted me on the shoulder as soon as I'd finished. \"Don't worry honey, everyone starts somewhere.\"\n\nI had to laugh and tell her what I was doing. She just smiled indulgently and shook her head at me",
