    "selftext": "**Welcome to the Physique Phriday thread**\n\nWhat's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.\n\nSo let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.). This isn't a thread to announce what you find attractive in a mate. Please use the report function for any comments that are out of line.\n\nSo phittit, what's your physique pheel like this phriday?",

Looking for genuine criticism/overall holistic advice.\n\nI have been genuinely trying to make significant process in the gym for *years* now and I feel like I'm at a standstill/have never really put on significant muscle mass; I've looked like this since I was 18. I swim competitively with a very fast team 5x per week (almost entirely aerobic threshold sets, 4-5000y) but I'm not sure if this is just incompatible with gym gains for the amount of aerobic/anaerobic work I'm doing, or if I just need to eat an absolute ton more (I feel like I'm already eating like 3000 calories a day minimum, but admittedly not tracking macros, just trying to satiate hunger), change my split routine at the gym up (have always done body part splits M/W/F), or just otherwise change something I'm not thinking of. But I've felt like I'm at this weird crossroads between not really being lean, not really being muscular, or just feeling sort of \"average\" in every respect. I'm a fast swimmer but I would like to be more toned/have far more muscle definition. Happy to give more information if anybody has thoughts on what to change.\n\nSorry my shorts are around my goddamn ankles in this picture, went hiking. No excuse.",

Though I think it's mostly a result of the bench press being my favorite exercise, so those muscles tend to get... a bit too much love in the gym.   \n  \n I'm thinking of adding hanging leg raises for core. As that seems to be a favored core exercise among lifters? I've also heard standing OHP does a lot for your core? An exercise I added a few months back.   \n  \nThe shoulder thing MAY just be in my head IDK. I'll try to add some clearer pictures in the next 6month interval :) I guess I should try better lightning and more angles before asking for feedback next time.",

I would recommend go slow on your bulk like just add 100 to 200 surplus calories then keep track of your weight and go on like that if your weight is stagnated add extra 100 or 200 like that I suggest to do a consistent bulk for like 4 months yes in the process you will gain fat but don't let that demotivate you it is a part of the process and also in the period of bulking make sure you are training super hard with heavy weights then once done do your cut it will be awesome. But great work keep training hard.",
