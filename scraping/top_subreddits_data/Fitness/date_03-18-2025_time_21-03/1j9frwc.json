            "body": "I am a skinny man in my early twenties (5'10\", 142lbs). I got into working out two months ago and I do see some changes here and there, but I'm afraid I'm not really doing things in the most optimal way possible, and I'd love to hear you guys' opinion on that.\n\nI workout 5 days a week. I superset EVERYTHING and I do completely unrelated muscles in these supersets so that I'd roughly 90-120 seconds to rest between each set of, say, bench presses. I train roughly 2 muscle groups per day. My plan is as follows:  \nDay 1: Chest + Legs  \nDay 2: Shoulders + Arms  \nDay 3: Chest + Legs  \nDay 4: Back + Abs  \nEvery week, I switch day 2 and day 4, and on day 5, I repeat day 2 and work both arms and abs as well as either back or shoulders. I take most my sets to failure and I end up doing roughly 9-12 sets per muscle group per workout. I focus on compound exercises like flat and incline bench presses, squats, shoulder presses, and pullups. \n\nI have been told it's bad to train big muscles like legs and chest on the same day, as that would lead to fatigue. I stopped experiencing fatigue after the first 2 weeks of working out, even though I push most of my sets to failure and make sure I use weights that are heavy enough to keep have me fail on the 8th-12th rep. Am I doing things right? Do I need to switch it up? Strength wise, I think I'm seeing results (I went from curling 20lbs to 55lbs), and I do see more definition in my chest and bigger biceps but I'm not sure if I should be expecting more, or if I can optimize my workout better. I really like supersetting as it saves me a lot of time and allows me to do a lot more volume + gives me the time to rest my target muscles and jump back into my set having regained almost all my strength. My goals are to both build muscle and get stronger. Maybe a slightly bigger focus on the building muscle bit.",

The last one, I passed with flying colours, but as this was the first time I\u2019ve done something like this, I made the mistake of overtraining and was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis in my left foot. Conservative treatment, stretches, ibuprofen gel sorted it out. \n\nNow, after a ligament injury in my right ankle which rendered me unable to walk for three weeks, the plantar fasciitis has flared up again, and this time it is more severe, before the first fitness test, I was running 3k or doing 20 minutes of interval running a day or doing and performing mock tests every four days or so. \n\nNow, I struggle to run 2/3rds of a kilometre on a treadmill without pain. My GP has referred me to a podiatrist in which I\u2019m still waiting to hear from, but in the meantime I\u2019ve been using an exercise bike in my gym for 10-15 minutes every day or two, bar weekends when I actually I have to perform. I use the tempo of the music to alter the resistance and power output to give the workout an \u201cinterval\u201d feel.\n\nMy question is, is this type of interval cycling, or cycling at all, an adequate replacement for interval running, or running at all?\n\nMy goal is to be able run around at a level on a Saturday afternoon doing my job at full fitness as I have been in the past, and not feel sluggish, overworked, or tired like I have been recently.\n\nI am a non-smoker and have access to a gym. My diet generally speaking consists of going beyond the five-a-day guideline, with my first meal starting with various fruits, most commonly mango, nectarines, apples, or pears, and others depending on the season. I usually try to incorporate as much vegetables into my diet as possible, yet still find it difficult to stay away from indulgences, chocolate, biscuits, etc. In spite of this and the odd bad day, I am gradually losing weight.",

It works better for speed and power-focused movements (kettlebell swings, cleans, snatches) because there are more ways to adjust your output (bar speed, catch height) than something like a bicep curl.\n\nIt's much harder to put 100% effort into 30-50% of your 10RM if you're not literally throwing the weight around.\n\nPavel also approves of 50-80% of 1RM for doubles and triples, higher rep ranges aren't a requirement.\n\n> This contrasts with the traditional progressive overload method, where you push sets closer to failure before increasing weight.\n\nYou don't need to push sets close to failure to justify increasing weight. In fact, if the weight is too light and the set is too easy, you should increase the weight more than if you were pushing close to failure.\n\nAlso, Pavel's method *is* traditional. The powerlifting and bodybuilding methods common today are more recent.\n\n> Would applying this method to Incline Bench once per week (3 sets) be enough volume to see results?\n\nProbably not. Pavel's method is meant for high frequency and volume since you're working so far from failure. If you increased the weight and lowered the reps then 3 weekly sets would make more sense.\n\n\n> How do you determine when to increase the load?\n\nWhen it feels too easy. Drop the weight when you fail a rep",

Good programs already incorporate something similar, but at a slightly higher intensity. \n\nYou don't need to train to failure to see results. But you also should be training relatively hard. For a lot of strength-based programs, you'll typically be doing most of your sets with around 2-4 reps in reserve. Aka, if it's your 10 rep max, you would be doing 6-8 reps with it. \n\nThe benefit of this is that you're not as fatigued between set to set, so you can do more sets. You can focus on improving form because you're never really struggling with the weight. And the stimulus for growth is definitely still there, especially if you can do more sets with it.\n\nNow, if it was more of a skill-based movement, I can 100% see the benefit of it. Something like a snatch or clean and jerk, doing relatively light weight, for low repetitions, for lots of sets, will 100% improve your ability to snatch/clean.",

I try to go to the gym 4 days a week, I can't go mondays nor thursdays\nMy questions are:\n1 Which is optimal \n2 Is it actually enough with only flies and inclined for hipertrophy? When I did PPL I was also doing flat press but I don't want to overload the muscle\n3 In what order should I do them? (Which one first/Both at the start, 1 at the start and do another muscle to let the chest rest to do it the next, let it rest more time, 1 first and one last...)\n\nAlso glad to know the most optimal rep range, I heard that in the first sets is 5-9 but closer to 5=better (rir 1 tho) and closer to 9=add weight if I can, but the last ones are more like 3-8",

You should probably do 10+ sets for chest weekly.\n\nSo two exercises each on two days, 3 sets per exercise is a more reasonable plan for training chest.",

This will be different from person to person, and even within the same person, this would change day to day and during the day.  Don't worry about optimal, \n\n>2 Is it actually enough with only flies and inclined for hipertrophy?\n\nIf your goal is hypertrophy for your chest, you want around 15-20 working sets per week.  Reps per set can be anywhere from 5-30.  You would perform each set with 1-2 RIR.  You may want to take the last set to failure, but not required.  You want to target both chest and upper chest.  An Incline press/fly and a flat press/fly.  You could get by with one movement for each If that is your preference.  If I were going for size, I would do dumbbell work and machines.\n\n>3 In what order should I do them? (Which one first/Both at the start,\n\nWhichever movement is your priority goes first.  After that you can alternate chest and back or do all chest movements back to back.  That is your preference.  Try it and see which works better for you.",
