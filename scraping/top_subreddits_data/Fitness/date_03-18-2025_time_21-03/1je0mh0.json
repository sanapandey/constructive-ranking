Sometimes my gym\u2019s barbell is occupied for a while, a good amount after I\u2019ve completed my warmup (20 or more minutes), and I give up and use dumbbells. I was wondering how bad it is to just start the workout without a barbell and go back to it after I see it\u2019s open, or if that\u2019s detrimental at all, because I know exercises are sequenced in a specific order.",

You can still get stronger and bigger with this approach, but you would likely make faster progress on barbell movements by consistently doing them as a beginner.  Second, you need to track progression across two variations.  Dumbbell and barbell lifts are not 1:1 exercises.  For best accuracy, you would want to track your progression on each exercise.  There will be a third drawback down the line.  Eventually, you will get strong enough to where they do not have dumbbells heavy enough for certain exercises and will also find the barbell easily to load and manage once you get to heavier weights.\n\nOverall, not the end of the world.  If you are making the progress you want and able to track between the two variations you are fine.",

You can also ask to work in with a person, though I imagine if you have trouble asking how many sets a person has left, this may be a bridge too far. Most people take long enough rests while doing barbell movement to allow for the switching out of weight and anyone who has been stuck waiting on a barbell to free up or a rack to free up will appreciate a person not wanting to do the same.",

Thus, you can do DB bench first, and if you then still can't get a barbell, just do DB splits squats. If time is a concern, I deem that preferable over waiting 15+ minutes for a barbell.  \n\nI don't like Workout B, as DB lunges, RDLs, pulldowns and biceps curls all tax your grip, making grip a concern. Order of exercises can matter here, as can what grip and grip assistance you're using. Furthermore, while DB RDLs are a fine stop gap exercises, I would prefer barbell RDLs.",

But a caution about assisted pull ups: the machine probably provides a lot more assistance than it say. For example, the one I used had 20 lbs as its\u00a0lowest assistance, but by stacking weights on it I found that it was closer to 40 lbs of total resistance. This is why I started wearing a backpack to get down to only a few pounds of assistance.\n\nConsistently doing assisted pull ups with less and less assistance is what got me to doing them unassisted.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t already doing them, I\u2019d add bicep curls too. I think that last little bit when you\u2019re almost to the bar but not quite involves the biceps a lot.\u00a0",

The simple truth is that there is more to designing a well-rounded program than people think. There's so many factors that most people don't even realize. \n\nAn analogy to this would be like: You can enjoy reading a book, without making yourself learn to write a book. Learning to write a book can be fulfilling, but very very few people will ever do so. And in fact, good authors love to read *other* people's books too. In the same way that good athletes understand that they often are unable to program for themselves, and will straight up hire somebody else to coach them.\n\nFor example, my best progress was when I was working with a powerlifting coach. Following his programming, which was adjusted weekly, I became the strongest I've ever been.\n\nBut he doesn't follow his own programming. Instead, he hires somebody external to write his programming for him. And he's seeing fantastic success with it, considering he's competed in the IPF a number of times now.",

We all start off with recipies from a book or someone more experienced.  Once we have that basic recipie down, we season it a little (make small tweaks) to suit our needs.  \n\nNow, can you try and create an entire meal from scratch with no guidance, sure.

Either that, or they're an absolute beginner moving weights that are light enough that RPE probably doesn't have any meaning. \n\nYou do 10 sets of compounds at 8.5-9 each week. On his program, on just barbell compound movements, he has 15 sets of RPE 8-9, and something like 33 sets of supplemental compound aiming for RPE 8 or higher. \n\nOverall volume isn't that high, I agree. Overall intensity is probably beyond what I would normally consider to be recoverable. \n\nLegit, to me, the program would look fine if he just bumped down the RPE of all his compound movements by 1. And just ignored RPE all together on his isolation work and just trained to or close to failure on those. Which is why I personally think he's undershooting his RPE. IMO, a lot of people undershoot their RPE by 1-2. And that's okay, because RPE is hard to implement properly.\n\nEdit: This is why I'm a percentage based guy. I can't judge RPE for shit.",

I don\u2019t eat a lot of meat so I mainly get my protein through Greek yogurt, eggs, and protein shakes all of which are usually 300+ calories per serving and also all mainly snacks rather than full meals.

Yeah, probably, but it's more about will it be noticeable rather than will it be possible.  No doubt you'll undergo *some* recomposition, but only training twice a week and eating a deficit you're not operating under ideal muscle gaining conditions.  And giving it a 100 day deadline cuts things short.  Recomping is necessarly a long, slow process because by trying to do both thing simultaneously, you're not doing either very well.  \n\nStill, as far as starting plans go, you're is good if you're just laying the groundwork for sustainable habits.",
