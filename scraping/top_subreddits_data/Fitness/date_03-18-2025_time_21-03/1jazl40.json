    "selftext": "**Welcome to the Physique Phriday thread**\n\nWhat's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.\n\nSo let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.). This isn't a thread to announce what you find attractive in a mate. Please use the report function for any comments that are out of line.\n\nSo phittit, what's your physique pheel like this phriday?",

However, I'm still new to the gym so I'm doing a new combination of exercises almost every day to see what I like best. On leg day, I LOVE smith machine squats with a play under my heels.\n\nFor my running, I used to be a competitive XC runner, so my cardio is better than most. I typically run 4--6 miles depending on how I'm feeling. I try not to do too too many.\n\nAnd for my cycling, I'm training for a 257-mile race across my state this summer, so I usually ride anywhere from 20 to 40 miles. I'll be running less and increasing those distances as it gets closer to race day.\n\nIn terms of diet, I don't track my macros exactly, but I make sure to get a LOT of protein for muscle growth and carbs for running fuel. I take no supplements.",

I also do 2 'non-conventional' lifts that don't really have a name as far as I'm aware. One is a shrug on a row set-up, with a *fuckload* of weight, far more than I can properly row. I don't even bend my elbows, I just shrug it about a foot. Amazing for scapular retraction. And I also take a rope, attach it to a cable, and (with arms straight) pull the rope from above my head to my behind hips. It's kind of like a dumbell pullover, but with a cable. Sorry if that isn't very clear lol. \n\nOf note, I go well beyond failure on everything but trapbar deadlifts and face pulls, I drop set a lot and do partials once I can't perform full reps. I figure I don't get DOMS in my back anyways so why not lol. I've also been training to do muscle ups the last few months, so a lot of explosive 'kip-rep' pull ups in addition to strict form. As much as kipping gets shit on, the stretch you get in the lats as you explode from the bottom is insane.",

I'll typically do a fourth drop set at body weight to failure extra slow at the end.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's been about 6 months since I got back in the gym, up to 65lbs now and tris are looking awesome. Plus they're fun.\u00a0\n\n\nOverhead cable extensions as mentioned in the other comment are also great.\u00a0",

I think I'm technically skinnyfat, does anyone have advice on where my calories should be at/general gameplan (eat at deficit, maintenance, surplus, should I change my routine or keep grinding)?

Once you start plateauing in 5x5 start looking around for an intermediate routine like gzclp, wendler 531, something off stronger-by-science or some other intermediate routine from a reputable source.",
