But I always see gym goers always say \"if you wanna be big, eat big\", sure makes sense. But bulking will also gain fat too? I understand there is clean bulking, but so many gym goers are like \"I have to be in a caloric surplus to gain muscle\" but doesn't this counter the science between, let's say the average of 1\u20132 lbs of muscle per month? Let's say my diet and gym routine caps me out at 1lbs of muscle per month, eating in a caloric surplus will just make me..... fat and muscle gain is not gonna increase cause... science?\n\nSo, my ultimate question is...... why eat all the calories when clean bulking seems to be a better choice? It seems that clean bulking will focus on muscle building, less fat gain and one can maintain their body fat %........\n\nPlease correct anything I said. I just don't understand why people say, go in a caloric surplus, go bulk then shred when the average person can only gain 1\u20132 lbs of muscle per month",

                    "body": "There is not a clear distinction between \"clean\" bulking and bulking. Both mean being in a caloric surplus and gaining weight. The difference is just one of degree. Clean bulking means being in a smaller surplus and gaining weight more slowly.\n\nOne disadvantage of a small surplus is it's hard to be sure you are in a surplus. Calorie counting and estimating TDEE is inherently imprecise. Tracking bodyweight is the only reliable way to know how much of a surplus you are in, but your weight fluctuates so small changes are hard to observe. So if you are trying to gain 1 lbs/month, you can't really see that slow change over a whole month. So it may take 2 months or more to even know if you are in a surplus or not.\n\nSo slow bulking is a fine strategy and probably does work well to limit fat gain, but it requires a lot of precision tracking calories and bodyweight. For most people it's easier to gain a bit faster and then just cut more frequently.\n\nAlso, that 1-2 lbs per month of muscle gain is pretty optimistic. My guess is most people in the gym are gaining way more slowly than that.",

Any time you gain weight, it's likely that the majority of weight gained will be from body fat. \"Clean bulking\" (I assume you mean gaining weight at a small surplus) will give you less body fat gained but also less muscle gained. Losing weight is, generally speaking, going to spare muscle if you lift while you do it, so a relatively rapid deficit works well.\n\nIn practice, if you struggle to lose weight like me, a smaller surplus and deficit may be warranted to give you an easier time losing the body fat you want to ditch.",

So no, you are not \"destroying gains\".\n\nBut you might be losing out on some additional gains, that you might be able to gain if you would be doing more sets per week. \n\n> My quads are always looking decent as I used to overtrain them\n\nWith that info, i would say you are fine for the time being.",

They\u2019re pretty finnicky and take so long to adjust but they\u2019re all I got so. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nNot going for a crazy surplus, a smaller one between 100-300 is fine for me.\n\nSome of my lifts are regressing since like 3-4 weeks ago, and I\u2019ve been feeling more fatigued and achy lately. I got sick a while ago (Other folks in the house were sick) and had to delay my workout by two days, then just pushed into it the following day.\n\nI\u2019m also just sick of eating so much, it takes up so much time in my day to plan it out especially with my schedule, especially having to eat healthy stuff which you need to eat TONS of, and I\u2019d be satisfied just having to eat once and maybe a few snacks here and there. Instead of two 1-1.4k calorie meals. It\u2019s kinda fun, but so time consuming!\n\nI\u2019m considering a full week off, just to see if it helps me. After tomorrow\u2019s workout.\n\nShould I continue to eat at a calorie surplus (Aiming for a slight one, about 100-300 above maintenance) during my break? Or taper back to maintenance since I\u2019m not working out. I still plan on getting my steps in, eating healthy, perhaps either walking with a weighted vest (Like I have during my routine on 2/4 rest days) or even a 36-40hr fast just to see how it makes me feel.\n\nAlso any tips on how to ease into the week off, then ease back into working out. I feel like in the back of my mind I\u2019m just being lazy. Should I eat surplus for 38 hours after my last workout to support MPS then go into maintenance/deficit/just eating when I\u2019m hungry? I eat so much fiber and protein I haven\u2019t felt real hunger in a long time.\n\nThe routine, **general feedback welcome** but I may have to clarify a few things. Sets and reps for example are the minimum.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/QUsLifZ\n\nIt\u2019s a heavily modified version of this\n\nhttps://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/3-day-full-body-dumbbell-workout",

Lifting is a marathon and not a sprint.\n\nThat being said: \n\n> it takes up so much time in my day to plan it out especially with my schedule, especially having to eat healthy stuff which you need to eat TONS of, and I\u2019d be satisfied just having to eat once and maybe a few snacks here and there.

But the amount you eat should not impact the time that much. Like, the difference between a bulk an a cut is maybe 5 min per day for me?",

                    "body": "Building muscle and losing facial fat is just a matter of recomposition and losing weight; looking toned is going to come with the same results.\n\nFor a schedule you don't need anything too extreme, just something that you enjoy and can be consistent with will get you the results - so long as you're eating in a caloric deficit and working out at a regular consistency.\n\n**Routine:**\n\nWhen I was new to the gym, I think the best routine is probably GZCLP. It might be a little confusing at the beginning but you can see the routine in [this image](https://www.saynotobroscience.com/content/images/2022/10/gzclp-infographic-030519-1.jpg).\n\nThe way to approach it is to just do the compound movements following the routine so you can really just go 1 day on, 1 day rest. I would follow the routine for the next 8 weeks and see how your body responds to that. \n\nThe main objective here is to ensure that you are consistent in attempting to increase the weight by 5 lbs on bench per week and 10 lbs on leg per week. If you can't hit your 5 reps like you're supposed to, let's say your bench is 135 lbs on your first week and you do 5 reps of that. Next week you go to increase it to 140 but you can only do 2. Keep that same weight at 140 and try it again on your next bench day.\n\nMake sure you track your workouts and how much you lifted, I used to use my notes now I use Google sheets on my phone to track progress. It is important you are diligent in actually making sure you are progressing if you want to see real results.\n\nFor form, ask people in the gym if they're doing a particular exercise if they can show you how to do it. Most people in the gym community are pretty chill with new comers and are willing to teach. Watch Youtube videos on good form.\n\n**Diet:**\n\nFor your calories right now, just track what you currently eat for the next 2-3 days so you have an idea of what you generally eat. From there, just subtract 500 calories of wherever, so if you know every morning for example you eat an egg sandwich with 2 strips of bacon and a slice of cheese, you could swap that out for a Fairlife protein shake which would take out the 500 calories. Just be wary to not add other calories later on in your day.\n\nIf you infrequently binge eat, then that's something to keep in mind. All that means that you're going too extreme in your diet to where you're not able to overcome your wants. It's okay to have unhealthy food in your routine, just as long as you build in your cheat wants into your diet.\n\nI hope this was a good writeup that helps, let me know if you need any clarification",
