I suspect you are going too hard-- it's okay to leave 2-3 reps in reserve. Don't go to failure all the time.\u00a0\n\n\nI think you are doing too many exercises. There's no need to hit leg press after squatting. I'd swap out hip thrust for an RDL. I wonder if you are compressing your stomach or if the vertical/horizontal position changes could be causing the problem. I also think you need to rest more between sets.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0You can start the next set when:\u00a0\n\n\n*Cardio and breathing have recovered\n*You feel physically strong and mentally ready\u00a0\n*You aren't limited by synergist muscles.

Deadlifts will help your core get used to the weight, which should help with being off-center/wobbly during the squat, though I'd wager it's more of an issue with imbalance in the legs - not necessarily a muscle imbalance, but not having the mind-muscle connection or strength to use equal force in both legs when going down, which heavy high rep full depth leg press will also fix.\n\nThe weight I use for leg press is 50% of my body weight + my 5-rep max for squats. I weigh 90kg and do 150kg for reps, so my leg press is 200kg for sets of 12. If you choose to add this to your routine, you should do the maximum possible weight for 3 sets of 12 reps (don't miss a rep even if you need to stop and breathe like 10s for it), and aim to increase the weight every week.",

Nothing about a stall in the original post.\n\nI would agree adding weight to the bar too quickly can lead to a stall.  Increasing volume may help break a plateau, but low volume does not guarantee a person would stall.  There are minimum volume programs. And I deloaded for years without an AMRAP and did not stall.  I do not understand the connection or necessity.",

That\u2019s stalling. It\u2019s like not touching the bar to your chest on the bench press\n\nLow volume/frequency can work. Not doing AMRAP after deload can work (although that\u2019s a common critique of Starting Strength, you deload and nothing changes). But there\u2019s a reason all strength beginner programs in the wiki have you squatting 2x per week and doing AMRAPs at some point. If he\u2019s stalling and if he\u2019s not doing that already, tweaking those two variables can help.",

Stuff like that.\n\nIf you are losing weight, you **will** invariably lose some muscle mass, and by association some strength. When compounded with eating less, people often panic. Don't mistake losing some strength as the wheels totally falling off. Dieting will also deplete glycogen, which will make you look smaller until you go back up to eating more.",

Instead of curling on consecutive days twice a week (Mon/Tue and Thu/Fri) try curling on alternate days if your schedule allows for it.
