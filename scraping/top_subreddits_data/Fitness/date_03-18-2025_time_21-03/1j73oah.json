Overall, I was 40 pounds heavier than what I was used to.\n\nI started working out recently. This week I can finally comfortably jog 3 miles again. I gained muscle and now can bench 100 pounds (which isn't a lot, but it's the most ever in my life). And I actually had a caloric deficit through all this and lost 4 pounds in the last month or so.\n\nOh, and my sleep schedule is no longer fucked. That's what I'm the happiest about.",
