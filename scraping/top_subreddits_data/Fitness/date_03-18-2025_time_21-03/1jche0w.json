Are you experiencing strength/muscle fatigue, or are your muscles just fine?\n\nYou may need to improve your cardiovascular fitness.  If what you meant is that other muscles are limiting your work capacity, you may need tonwork on those muscles, your form, and/or bracing.  It is difficult to say based on the way you described the problem.",

Your wrists don't have to be in a straight line, which is more comfortable for many people, and you can achieve greater range of motion on many exercises which allows you to get better stimulus with less weight.\n\nThey also force each arm to do the same amount of work, meaning you can't accidently compensate for a weak right arm with a strong left or vice versa. \n\nHowever, once you start getting up into heavy dumbbells they can become inconvenient to get in the starting position, and they're less stable than barbells so you can't always crank as hard as you can with barbell exercises. \n\nBut no, there's nothing magic about barbells that make them superior, and any strength gains you make with dumbells will have massive crossover to barbell exercises.",

My form was always on point and I could rep 450+ lbs multi sets about a decade ago.  I picked up powerlifting again back in October, benefitted from the linear gains, and everything was progressing well outside of a touch of Tennis Elbow.  I've scaled back from a 6 day PPL week to just the first 3 days per week because of work obligations.  The form on my deadlifts on my last two pull days has been horrendous.  I progress through all my cues, including the one about pushing my heels through the floor, but now I'm really just pulling the weight up with my back and with zero hamstring engagement.  Consequently, my lower back stiffens uo like crazy. \n\nI can't explain what's going on.  I'm not lifting more weight.  I haven't suffered an injury.  I'm going to be 49 years old in a couple of months.  Maybe I've lost too much mobility?  Anyone go through something similar?",

Maybe a good analogy is how we breathe in an autonomic manner.  We are unaware of it, and we don't think about it.  But once we are aware, we begin to control every breath and become hyper aware of the process.  So when I no longer can automatically perform a movement according to the patterning I have practiced, I overthink and become hyperaware.  This creates uncertainties and over corrections that just make it worse.\n\nI recently had this with deadlifts where I could not get the slack out of my back.  I normally have no issue locking down my brace, but last week, I just couldn't lock it in.  I have no idea what changed or why.  I tried to work through it, but the awareness of the issue diminished both my ability to generate force and confidence.  It also led to several compensatory mistakes.\n\nIt normally goes away on its own soon enough.  If not, some additional technique work is often helpful to dial back in the cues.",

I usually train in the 4 -5 set range with fewer reps of high weight.

You've got 11 sets for your quads, and only 3 sets for your hamstrings. You've got no squats, no RDLs, and no direct calf work.\n\nIn my opinion your split has way too much isolation work and not enough compound movements for what you're trying to do.",
