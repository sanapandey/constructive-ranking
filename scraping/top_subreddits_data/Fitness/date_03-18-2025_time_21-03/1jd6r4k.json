General advice I give on unracking.  Back tight, lift your butt off the bench to pin your upper back, think push into the bench and not lift the bar, perform a lat pull down to unrack the weight.

Some things are definitely worth cheating for, others are not.\n\nAnd you just have to be more under than you are over to lose weight.

This can result in both a poor strength building exercise, and a really mediocre cardio session. This ain't HIIT.\n\nI personally don't train much above the 8 rep range for compounds because my conditioning is admittedly poor, but it's also not something I'm actively trying to improve.

Once you start noticing a difference (i.e. some lost weight and some muscle forming), it becomes addicting and you will want to push yourself harder - at this point, really dial in your diet and follow a good program (there are many to choose from).",

That's great and honestly good on you - that is crazy good progress!\n\nNow regarding changing your diet when you add in gym work, be careful. If you're doing resistance training (i.e. heavy weights), you're not actually burning that many calories, so better to just keep your same deficit. If you're adding in cardio, you can up your calories a little bit, but not by a lot.\n\nThe big change, however, is changing your diet proportions. You want to ensure you are getting enough protein to build muscle, but also, don't overlook a healthy amount of carbs before training to give you the energy you will need. However, this is stuff you can focus on a little bit later, like I said before, just get in and push through your first month - once you get the motivation to keep going and doing better, you will naturally want to dial in these aspects to improve your performance.",

Depends on the space you have, ability to not be distracted, etc. But if it gets you moving, that's infinitely better than a gym you don't go to. Heck, you can check out r/bodyweightfitness for routines and suggestions that don't require my much equipment. It'll be harder to progress than a gym with lots of equipment, but humans were capable of being fit long before the invention of gyms.\n\nAs for the body pump class, that too will give you benefits. They may not be the same as self-directed lifting, but if it keeps you consistent it's great.\n\nThere is no one single routine to optimally keep you fit. You need to figure out what works with your lifestyle and do that.\n\nBased on what you're saying, I'm wondering if you'd benefit more from a skill-based fitness approach right now: rock climbing, kickboxing, gymnastics, etc. as opposed to a structure lifting. You seem aimless.",

Then you start adding more reps again.\n\nThere's also \"Wave Progression\" where you train at some submaximal weight and go from higher rep/lower weight to lower rep/higher weight week after week. 5/3/1 programs do this, and usually have you adding weight every 3-4 weeks (depending on how often you need a deload week).\n\nAlso, what's your diet like? It's way easier to push more weight while bulking. I hit a wall during my cut and was barely adding weight on a monthly cadence, but now on a bulk I almost feel like I'm making linear progress again.

But not your neck!!!\n\nThis is probably going to feel uncomfortable at first because to be frank you have thin skin quite literally and if you are starting out you don't have much muscle mass so the bar is going to be pressing on bones more.\n\nFucking with your grip width can help if it creates a better ledge but in general it's going to be uncomfortable until you develop thick skin and an upper back.\n\nA lot of guys will have calluses on their upper back for this reason. \n\nand for God's sake don't put a pad on the bar",
