            "body": "In the past few months, I have been experimenting with Tinder. Six months ago, I found my wife cheating on me and began the divorce process despite being married only a year. I am only 24 and I still live in the college town in which I went to school. I am in the middle of the process for an at-fault divorce, it is estimated to be completed in the next couple of weeks. Going from coming home to a wife every day to being alone, has been quite the adjustment. I have been pretty obvious with my intentions when talking to girls. I have just been looking to hook up and have some human interaction.\n\nOne of the girls I matched with was about 3 years younger than me and still in college. She was definitely on the borderline of being too unattractive for me, but I matched and initiated a conversation nonetheless. Despite my lack of physical attraction, I quickly realized I had more in common with this girl than anyone I had ever spoken to. For the next 3-4 weeks we texted off and on regularly. It never felt like a boring conversation and like I said, we shared all of the same interests. As the weeks progressed, she asked me a couple of times to meet her at the bars downtown of the college town I live in. Being out of college for 3 years now, I respectfully declined, as I have not been to these college bars in years and thought that I would be out of place. One night, one of my best friends who is 3 or 4 years younger than me asked if I would be interested in going to these same bars to watch the school's college basketball game. Knowing that it was spring break and most of the annoying college kids would be gone and that there was a high possibility the aforementioned Tinder girl would be lurking downtown, I agreed. Having the plans set, I let her know that me and a friend were going to be downtown that night and she mentioned she and a friend would join us.\n\nJust as our texting history went, we hit it off immediately. I could tell she was pretty tore up, but I was too and we very much enjoyed each other's company. After just a few hours, she began to touch my legs and be more intimate. As I mentioned earlier, my attraction to her physically was limited, at best, but her personality overcame it and then some. I was quickly overloaded in my mind with thoughts that I must get this girl to go home with me. Without much convincing, at night's end she agreed to come home with me. She accompanied me and my zombie of a friend back to my apartment, I got him situated and put to rest before spending the night with her and doing the deed.\n\nNow, our story begins. The same night after completing the act, I struggled to go to bed due to my drunkenness. When I finally was ready to fall asleep (she had been asleep the entire time) I laid down beside her and watched her cuddle up next to me. I rarely like physical touch or cuddling with women, but for some reason, I utterly enjoyed every second of it with this girl. All three of the girls I had slept with after splitting with my wife and before this girl had been much more attractive, but I could not wait to get out of their presence and could have cared less about speaking to them again. While laying there, a scary thought came in my mind \u201cI think I like this girl\u201d. Not even 60 seconds after this thought went through my mind, I heard her phone ring (it\u2019s 4am). It proceeds to ring 5 or 6 more times, but shes too out to wake up to it. I finally pick it up and notice it's a guy. I didnt think to much of it considering I had spent approximately 6 hours with this girl in my entire life. Well, this guy was not taking no for an answer, because he proceeded to call her ATLEAST 50 times. She finally gets fed up and wakes up from the annoying sound. She looks at who it is and doesn't answer, cuddling up closer to me in the process. After another 10 minutes or so of calling more, I tell her \u201cif you want to answer that, I will be silent\u201d. She answered and I could not make out what was said. When she hangs up, she immediately gets up, puts on her pants, and says \u201cSomeone is coming to pick me up\u201d. From there, she told me she has an ex-boyfriend who cheated on her multiple times, who she still shares her location with. He was freaking out and coming to pick her up. Feeling like I was way to old for this nonsense, I told her it would not end well for him if he tried to break in here to free her, so she needed to decide what she wanted. I implored her to rid herself of this toxic guy, not for me or anyone else, but for her. I told her she was amazing. Not wanting police to get involved or violence, she thought it was best for her to let him take her home. She left and said she would text me when she got home. This was 5am, I woke up at 9am, and I was blocked on everything. No text, no snap, nothing. I still have not said anything to her since that goodbye. It has been 3 days now, and for the life of me, I cannot stop thinking about her. What is the most likely scenario for what happened? Why is this girl that I am not even really physically attracted to so hard for me to get over? What are the chances I will ever speak to her again?",

It's possible the ex isn't even an ex and she was the cheater in the relationship. The thing is you'll likely never know. She was sharing her location with an ex, chose to go with the ex rather than stay with you, and blocked you instead of the cheating ex who was blowing up her phone. I'd say that combo should be more than enough to tell you where her head's at.\n\nAlso she was drunk when all of this happened. After a couple hours of sobering up, she may have felt a little different about you or her choices than she did when she was sloshed. The regrets hit a lot harder when you're hungover.",
