We don't know enough of this situation to fully judge either person with this \"tip of the iceberg\" in one post.\n\n\nMaybe she was annoyed already, having a bad day, and on here comes OP with his elaborate, continuous fiction storyline.\n\n\nNow imagine this. You've never seen anyone act in this way and it's totally foreign to you. You're wondering \"where is this coming from? What do they mean with this? Why would anyone tell anybody they just met a nonsense story?\"\n\nAnd then you begin to compare it with any situation you can understand, relate with. This is how association works in the mind. You find something you can understand to connect the dots. And purely by chance, I bet this gal landed on \"omg it's just like kids telling lies to fool someone else\"\n\nFrom there on out, the discomfort is double, on one hand they feel left out because -joke or not- they likely don't get it. On the other hand they get angry/annoyed because they think \"this person is making fun of me\".\n\n\nAnd. It . Just. Doesn't. Stop.\n\nAt this point OP could've still fixed this misunderstanding by a small clarification. Talking about what they meant with their comments, clarifying the misunderstanding. This would be both caring about having the other person involved in the conversation and a moment of self-exposure.\n\nFor example: \"Oh sorry, I just like to joke around this way. I'm not trying to make you believe anything, I just love exaggerating on fictional stories. It's my way of bantering. Sorry if that went too far. To clarify I'm kidding about the bank robbery. (Unless... \ud83d\udc40)\"\n\nAnd *then* when you're sure you're on the same page again you can go \"I wasn't kidding about going somewhere with you tho. You down to grab a coffee?\" -Or whatever and see where it goes from there.\n\n\nIn my eyes this is a simple communication issue. \n\nRemember those communication process diagrams? https://clearinfo.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Diagram-of-Communication-Cycle-1536x864.png\n\n\nOP was thinking A, she was thinking B, there was  \"noise\" on the conversation in the sense that texting limits getting a grasp on the situation, also no clarification happened of what the other person was thinking. Conversation flops, OP thinks \"what went wrong, I thought she was on board with A\", meanwhile she's automatically assuming\"I don't wanna talk with this person anymore, they only think B\".\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nWe all gotta assume more that other people aren't thinking what we're thinking. Something obvious to us might be something else entirely to their perception. Clear communication is key. Talk things out, then move on when they're up to date with your ideas.\n\n\nNot thinking what the other is thinking doesn't make anyone an idiot",

If you\u2019re both adults, that could be a turn off for an adult woman. A grown woman wants a grown man, and this doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t sometimes act silly and goofy with each other, but it does mean that you do consider your partner and look to them in your silly goofy moments.",

Maybe one or two messages after the 'oh boy' jokingly would have been enough. She was clearly over it and you did well to not let that affect your enjoyment but you probably should have just changed tact. You also probably shouldn't have asked her 'what she wanted to do instead' as she was likely already in a heightened negative emotional state and may resent having to make a decision from that state..even if only in jest..which just leads to her being more annoyed.\n\nOr like.. ya know..
