Privated tracker profiles are the same thing essentially, either a cheater hiding his stats or just someone so bad at the game they get red tracker and they are ashamed of it.\n\nYou can intentionally abuse the refund mechanic assuming riot's cheater detection actually works by intentionally not remaking vs said player, which can be easily scouted by using the tracker overwolf app.",

On Tuesday you get the notification you can reclaim your RR within the next 7 days, so you gotta queue up Valo on the weekend again, even if you were planning to play maybe Marvel Rivals. \n\nMy last comp games were 9 days ago for example and I have a bunch of 7+ days gaps between games, like a LOT of players.

I know that learning that someone used unfair means to gain an advantage in the match is far from the most enjoyable experience. However, I would like to thank you for helping us get the cheater out of the game by being vigilant and reporting the case to us. Our goal is to make sure every player enjoys fun and fair matches and has equal chances of winning.*\u00a0  \n  \n*To make the situation more clear, it's possible for a cheating player to not be caught during the match. I know this may be very tough to hear, but if this player wasn't caught during the match, the loss mitigation option wouldn't be applicable and we cannot make any kind of post-match modifications, as we are not able to alter RR, MMR or a player's current placement.*\u00a0  \n  \n*I hope that I was able to clear some things out in regards to the matter at hand, although if you have any other concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.*\u00a0  \n  \n*Wishing you a wonderful day and best of luck on your VALORANT journey!*  \n\n\n***The Mad Clown***  \n*Riot\u00a0Games Player Support*",
