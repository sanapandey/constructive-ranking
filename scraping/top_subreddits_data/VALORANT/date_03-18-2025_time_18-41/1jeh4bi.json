I have GB internet that works flawlessly for everything else, but every now and then I get a day where my ping spikes in the game make it nearly unplayable. Causes me to lose rounds for sure. For some reason, it\u2019s typically fine before the round starts, but as soon as it starts, my ping starts spiking. Very weird",

Drop your graphic settings to low and see if that has any effect on this.\n2. Turn off (disable) windows update in Services.msc\n3. Turn of Game mode\n4. In your Display settings in windows, you should see \"Advanced graphics settings\", inside that you should see \"Hardware accelerated GPU scheduling\", DISABLE that.\n5. Turn off Gsync, Vsync.\n\nif none of these work, talk to your ISP for forwarding the riot ports and try again.  \nIf that doesn't' work, clean your system of unwanted programs and reset windows as a last resort.",
