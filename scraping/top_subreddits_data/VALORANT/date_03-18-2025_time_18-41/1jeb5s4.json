Would be a more fitting email coming from Sage or Cypher. Idk",

Interesting that her main concern seems to be more about how to get him back into the fight than actually having a connection, it's like a coach of some sorts.\n\nShe got it, Phoenix problem is his \"why\". Now I want to know the \"why\" too, some backstory please lol",

After all, he was also put on the news for the Venice incident.\u00a0Since Jett\u00a0and Phoenix\u00a0are pretty close, I could see her fears affecting him by proximity.\n\nAlso: happy we\u2019re getting Phoenix lore, feels like a while since we\u2019ve seen him.",

With his name on it.\n\nPhoenix did Arts on university. It can be a show of some sorts where he is part of it and probably will invite some people of VP to watch it. Where? Or is it in UK or in Toronto, following VCT schedule, like it was in Bangkok",
