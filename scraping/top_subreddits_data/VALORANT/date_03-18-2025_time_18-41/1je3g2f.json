Also in prop play, the people with pistols + armour are also capable of hitting their shots so it isn't as bad usually.",

Those calculated saves work because pros have insane coordination and even the pistol players hit their shots consistently. In Gold/Plat, that strategy just falls apart because the execution isn't there.",

IMO they don't even think about the second round buy or think that by not buying they can buy vandal third. Actually had a couple friends think that way before I had an hour long argument with them trying to force them to use the last Braincell still working.\n\nThe Navi buy is good imo even in low ranks if you coordinate with who takes fights. If the Reyna's were trying to copy the strategy they would also know about the weaknesses and don't force fights with a ghost. \n\nAlso why are people not using half shields more? I feel like the teams bank every second round with how much money I save on shields.",

It's just the highest% play to win round 2, you can also reduce that win% slightly by having 1 less gun and buying a hero rifle in round 3 to increase that rounds win% or for example if I'm saving for an OP I will decide if I need to upgrade my ghost/sheriff or save for an OP that will potentially win round 4, 5, 6 and so on.\n\nJust as you said it's not a pro game and whilst everyone sees this kind of strat as a pro play it's sometimes just economics. Just like buying someone an AK when they can't afford it but you can, you can say no. Every single low elo <immo player will let it get them down for the rest of the game and hate the player who didn't buy and now you've lost more than just 1 gun, 1 round. I waffled but my point is that don't let it affect you for more than 1 round and stop saying people are throwing your games based on 1(or 2) round(s).",

The team that loses pistol should save enough credits in round 2 so they can full buy in round 3.\n\nThat's the whole point of buying the mid tier guns in round 2 so you in theory have a free round win in round 2.\n\nSure you have a lower chance of winning round 3 but if you manage to take down a few phantoms / vandals the enemy can't have a full buy round 4 while your team can. So at that point in theory you should be 3 - 1 after round 4.\n\nWith the way you spent, you win pistol, then don't use credits round 2 to give yourself an easy round and then when you full buy round 3 you have a full buy vs a full buy.\n\nImagine you win pistol, lose 2nd round because you don't buy, lose the 3rd full buy vs full buy round, now you can't full buy for round 4 and you are most likely down 1 - 3, while you should be up 3 - 1.",
