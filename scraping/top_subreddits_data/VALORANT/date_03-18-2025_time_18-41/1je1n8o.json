    "selftext": "Why do a lot of highly skilled players seem to be stuck in low elo atm? At rank resets players get placed 4-5 ranks lower than before (g3->s2) and (s2->b2).\n\nFor this example lets take the 4 ranks as an average. This means you will have to gain 400RR to get back to the rank you belong. Lets be a bit generous here and say you gain +20RR for every win. This means you will need 20 more wins then loses to get back to your own rank. TO GET BACK TO THE RANK YOU BELONG! \n\nFor this example lets again be very generous and say that in this \u201clower rank\u201d you will have a winrate of say 70% (which is way too high imo because you will be matched with players that went through the same rank reset). But anyways let\u2019s exaggerate in favor of riot a bit. A 70% winrate means that if you play 10 games you actually gain the RR for 4 games (since 7-3=4). This means you will have to play 50 (FIFTY FUCKING GAMES) to get back to the rank you belong. \n\nGiven that only a small minority of the player base plays that consistently its quite easy to deduce that a lot of people never go back to the rank they belong. Cluttering up the ranks (especially low elo). \n\nI really think this should change if we want to keep the game alive. In this example im being quite generous and many players will probably have to play even more games to get back to the rank they belong.",

If a player peaked let's say plat 2 at the end of the season, but he plays now in gold 1 after 2 months from the reset....that might actually be his true rank in comparison to the current player base.\n\nHe might have gotten to plat 2 when ranks were inflated or even worse, he got carried. A game like Valorant has a lot of variables and while match making is far from perfect, I honestly believe  someone isn't stuck at a certain rank....it's just their rank.",

It has taken 3 consecutive resets but my Plat 1 when I played regularly is now borderline Bronze 3. I top frag for the team almost every game and get accused of smurfing all the time. \n\nMy games go one of two ways and it is ALWAYS determined by which team has more deranked ascendants in it. It's a smash or get smashed situation and the genuine new players are lucky to get 4 kills in a game. They are at the right rank.....but they tank the entire team because Silver.....isn't really Silver anymore.\n\nThe amount of MMR won or lost should be far far more greatly weighted to individual performance. You get 40+ kills in a 13:1 game it should be +250 not +20",
