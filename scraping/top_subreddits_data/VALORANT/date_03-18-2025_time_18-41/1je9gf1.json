    "selftext": "10 RR away from Immortal 1 and now I have a 10 in a row loss streak. It's going to be ok right? I'll climb back up right?\n\nIt just sucks to be THAT close. Then go on a loss streak.\n\nI had a Gekko go 5 and 20, didn't really care, didn't really comm. Hate to see it on a rank up game. I didn't perform amazing either, went even. Tried my best, communicated and try to bring our Gekko up whenever he got a kill. Cooked up strats, but they had a cracked Reyna that clutched up for them. Lost 10-13.\n\nI know if I really wanted it, I should've played out of my mind. No one to blame but myself. Maybe that's why I went on a loss streak after.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
