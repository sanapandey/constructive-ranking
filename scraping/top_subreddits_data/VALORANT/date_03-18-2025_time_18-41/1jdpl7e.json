    "selftext": "OMG stop buying pistol + light shield after you win 1st round!!!\n\nYou are increasing the risk of losing against eco and another round. YOU ARE NOT PRO. Dont use a strategy you once saw in champions... You have a good fucking chance of losing the round because you didnt buy with your team. And for what??\n\nYour team is still going to go bonus 3rd round even if you dont throw the 2nd round...\n\nEnd note: Im not talking about a coordinated calculated risk, where everyone goes light buy 2nd because for example u desperately need to win the 3rd one as well.",

I regularly have full mute people on my team or the ones that simply prefer to communicate in a variety of languages that I don\u2019t speak unfortunately.\nAnd I would assume that even on NA servers, where there ist almost no language barrier, ignoring calls is a regular issue in every elo. Personally I feel that a simpel Call works more often than a slightly more complex one.\n\nHowever I would argue that if you have better weapons running as 5 into a stack with worse weapons/pistols is surprisingly often better than avoiding the stack, planting and playing postplant in something around or in between 4v4 or 5v5 scenarios. Because pushing as 5 you at least somewhat have a decent chance that your team fights together. Therefore you go into the stack and fight a 5v3 with better guns, which should highly favor your team. If you get into a 5v5 postplant something far worse and more common than bad communication comes into play. People chasing eco frags, (over-)pushing enemy spawn, taking unfavorable duels against worse weapons and dying 1 by 1. Consequently i honestly prefer fighting the stack together with better weapons than watching my teammates willingly and actively hand over their lives as well as guns postplant and thereby lose the round. The more enemies you got to fight before postplant together the better because it leaves less possibilities of people throwing by dying in the hunt for eco frags.",

I actually communicate and call a lot because you win a lot more games by doing so and you can frequently prevent your teammates from tilting or going at each other\u2019s throats. And in normal gunrounds I would agree that playing with lurks or fakes for example makes a lot of sense because you increase the chance of winning the round however against an eco the simplest strat (push as 5) gives you the best chance to win the round and has the highest probability of people following it. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\n\n3) Common we both know that people don\u2019t chase eco frags as team. They don\u2019t push together postplant they go one by one through different chokepoints and don\u2019t do it strategically at all, they just want the easy kills. 1 or 2 are mostly already gone chasing while the person with spike is planting and the others are clearing the rest of site. And from what I can tell chasing eco frags is an issue in every elo. Kinda makes sense because from iron to radiant there are a lot of people with inflated egos that define themselves way to much over the amount of kills they made in video game for some reason.\nBut even if we assume you overheat as a team it\u2019s still not a good decision because you go into chokepoints against worse guns for no reason while you actually can just set up for preferable duels that suit your (better) weapons. And btw on certain agents it\u2019s just bad to not play postplant as playing postplant is their biggest or only strength on attack.",
