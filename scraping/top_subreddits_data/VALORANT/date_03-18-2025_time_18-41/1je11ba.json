That\u2019s fine.\n\nObviously there\u2019s also a higher chance he dies, since he\u2019s the duelist entrying and he sacrificed his flashes and wall so he\u2019s just dry peeking.\n\nI pick it up, and we win the round. But the next round, he goes \u201cgive me back my gun\u201d and gets mad when he doesn\u2019t get it back.\n\nOr even worse, when we LOSE pistol round and he forced a naked vandal. \n\nShould we give it back to the person or keep it?",

Mute, report if he throws or flips out. \n\nHe died. Not his gun. He\u2019s not entitled to it. The fact that he \u201cgot mad\u201d is an instant no from me and I would have given it back if he had nicely asked and left room for a no. And i could personally care less if he\u2019s going to \u201cthrow\u201d now for being upset. Go ahead! Giving it back is just showing him it works to cry and demand vs showing him people could give a fuck less if he wants to be childish or toxic. I think it\u2019s a horrible mental to be in if you\u2019re submitting to assholes and trolls \u201cfor fear of them throwing\u201d in situations where they are in the wrong. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy to me how many of you care more about a slightly increased probability of winning by doing whatever toxic people demand vs having any kind of standards for someone\u2019s behavior in game.",

If you\u2019re going to be an asshole I\u2019m not giving it to you and you can learn how to speak to people and have some basic manners.\n\nIMO it makes this game even more toxic to allow people to speak to their teammates like that in round 2 and have zero consequences. At the end of the day he died. The gun wasn\u2019t \u201chis\u201d so the least he can do is ask nicely and have some basic manners.",

If someone is force buying a gun and doesn\u2019t get full armor , they are more at risk to dying on that 2nd round.

So if everyone had the same mindset of let\u2019s just buy the best gun and not go full armor , you risk losing essentially a free 2nd round. Not only that , the other team now picks up those guns and their other eco is good for the rest of the half. \n\nIt\u2019s highly selfish to buy the big gun 2nd round and you may see pros do it because they have a thought out strategy. In a random pug, it\u2019s merely selfish to do so and then to expect to get it back if you die. It\u2019s the same thing as requesting for a gun then you die , and next round everyone can buy except for the person who bought you the gun and you immediately buy for yourself instead of them.

And a full buy on second round is a valid strategy. People on valorant, much like in life, are self centered and have a problem communicating and working together. If you see your teammates are saving, don't be a dickhead and waste your money. That's stupid. Wasting money on a specter rnd 2 might not even be the best idea either. There's loads of strategies, but you need to be doing it with your team in mind not just yourself \n\nWin or lose rnd 1, if you all do the same thing 2, and you all do a bonus round (don't buy just use leftovers from last round/guns you picked up) 3rd then usually you're always gonna be in a good spot, and if you've been losing you're gonna have a good chance for a take back. If you all do the same thing. \n\nIf you win the first round, you have the money advantage. Now you can all chose to save and buy small that is 100% valid. Win or lose, bonus round 3rd and youre in the money. \n\nBut you can also all chose to buy high tier guns and some util n armour. Now you're at a gun advantage and will likely win round 2 if you're coordinated. Then rnd 3 you do a bonus round with those guns and have a good money advantage and either be 3-0 in a very good spot.
