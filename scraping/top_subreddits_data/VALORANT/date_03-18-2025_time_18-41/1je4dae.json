    "selftext": "I love playing this game and I love playing pocket kay/o. Just watching my team get multi-kills off my flashes feels so good. Also having the team be appreciative because they get free kills is great. With this playstyle I get a lot of assists, at least 15 per game. I'll often end with a score of about 12/15/20 if I'm having a bad day. We then win the game by a bit, usually about 5 rounds. But then I get +13 rr. Idk how it is so little, my mmr is okay and I get 2 first bloods, a few plants and defuses, and yet I get so little rr. So I propose every 3 assists hold the same value as a mid-round kill. What do you think?\n\n",

            "body": "I think they should differentiate between util causing conditions, smoke, heal and damage assists.\n\nCondition (Flash/vulnerable/decay/buffs) assists are probably the ones that have the most worth. They require communication, teamplay and sometimes additional tech. After that I\u2018d say we have Smoke assists. They at least need some kind of communication and are valuable util for the round, but not that directly influential for a kill than flashes are. After that damage assists. They help converting frags easier but in almost every case only happen because someone whiffed his shots beforehands. Heal assists are last in line because they are kinda useless. You don\u2018t influence the enemies with healing and don\u2019t really buff your team as with Brims stim beacon. A heal is only good when your enemies can\u2018t shoot, so it gets less worth the higher you are in the ranked ladder.\n\n1: condition causing assists 2: smoke assists 3: damage assists 4: heal assists\n\nThis would be my order if I had to rank types of assists by how I feel their worth is.\n\nEdit: I forgot about Scan Assists; I\u2018d put them in category one because of their huge value and potential to spam through obstacles",

However I absolutely agree that assists for flashes, stuns, decay, hinder, surpress and reveal should be valued higher because they require more timing, team play and for the most part a bit more skill. \n\nSince there are so many different types of assists it would maybe make sense to rather show how well you did in some kind of assist score taking into account the impact and skill of the assist rather than simply showing the number of kill participations. Would be way more rewarding for dedicated utility agent players for sure. And it would allow to give damage assists different values/scores depending on how much damage you actually did and not just look if it\u2019s over or under 50.",
