            "body": "Are comms useful? Yes. Are they completely necessary and should you blame your losses on people not comming? Absolutely not. \n\nWhen I took a break from the game like 3 years ago, at around plat or so, I came back and just didn't want to comm anymore cause of how exhausting it was with the kind of community this has slowly become. Not only did it help me focus on my own game, but I could think a lot clearer without having to start comming info that teammates may or may not have seen. Not to mention (I don't know how it is now in plat), but people would simply start flaming you or throwing slurs the second shit wasn't going well, which was even more distracting in an already stressful environment, which helps literally no one on the team. \n\nI did that pretty much all the way till immortal, and only when I finally hit immortal did I start actually communicating again cause the players in that rank have gone thru the same shit to get there as I have, and are a lot more communicative rather than just straight up toxic. Obviously there's toxic people in immortal, but it is nowhere near the levels it is in lower elos. \n\nWhich is why I consistently tell people to comm for the first couple rounds, if no one is talking but they're actively listening, then continue comming for your team (and obviously if the team is vibing then ofc comm). But if people start flaming or saying shit that mentally takes you or your team out of focus, either mute their comms, or voice comms in general (not pings), and just focus on your own game. There's a reason people say mind games is such a big factor in FPS games, and if its your own teammates fucking up your focus and confidence, why would you ever comm to them or leave them unmuted.",

However you can make the same argument for picking 5 duelists, playing SMG/Shotgun/Pistol only etc. You can still win with it, but your win% goes down drastically compared to playing normally and then it's absolutely a reason to \"blame your losses on it\".\n\n>I came back and just didn't want to comm anymore cause of how exhausting it was with the kind of community this has slowly become. Not only did it help me focus on my own game, but I could think a lot clearer without having to start comming info that teammates may or may not have seen.\n\nYeah I bet your teammates appreciated it a lot having less help calling out positions as they were hitting a site, and having the controller on the other side of the map instead of holding their angle spend half the time looking at minimap judging if a danger ping means \"one person is moving away from main to mid\" or \"they are 5-man rushing my site, smoke fast and rotate ASAP\".\n\n>Which is why I consistently tell people to comm for the first couple rounds, if no one is talking but they're actively listening, then continue comming for your team (and obviously if the team is vibing then ofc comm).\n\nIf you consistently say this then you should know that being the only one communicating is fucking exhausting and sucks. Having to look around to get confirmation on a play instead of someone saying \"sure\", or having important information like if someone is low typed out mid-gunfight so you have to look down, or finding out the enemy team is on site because they planted the bomb just makes you annoyed and often leads to the few people comming to stop as well. And fyi, I'm also immortal.\n\nI get why certain groups like women don't want to comm because often the whole lobby's vibe completely shifts for the worse after doing it even if they just want to play normally, but in your case it seems like you just couldn't be bothered with it, and then you shouldn't excuse it. Just mute the toxic individuals and continue playing normally.\n\n>There's a reason people say mind games is such a big factor in FPS games, and if its your own teammates fucking up your focus and confidence, **why would you ever comm to them** or leave them unmuted.\n\nBecause it's very rare that all 4 of them were toxic, and you are punishing them too by not giving them info. Comming increases your winrate, and since most people enjoy winning more than losing (especially in ranked), that's a pretty good reason to do it.",
