It seemed like it was right after me killing them while silently navigating corners.  Though these same people were calling lots of people rats.  I'm guessing this is a Val term used when someone is mad you played the tactical shooter in a tactical way?  Someone explain plz\n\n**EDIT: I didn't know I could hold Shift to walk slower and quietly hahahaha.  Thank you so much! This will be helpful!**\n\n**EDIT 2: Only a couple enemies were calling me a rat.  My team then went hard in chat letting them know they were being whiny babies.**\n\n**EDIT 3: Oh my gosh, I'm sorry for crouching! I've removed the key from my keyboard and swallowed it!**",

            "body": "people don't like when you do things they don't expect. being called a rat is just shorthand for \"why aren't you playing the game in the ballsy way i expect you to\" or \"you should only be beating me if you're aiming better.\" don't worry about it too much. You're right that \"someone is mad you played the tactical shooter in a tactical way.\"\n\nnow as for your angle clearing... crouching is silent, however it is slower which **gives the enemy time to see your shoulder/toes before you can see them.** remember: your line of sight comes from the middle of your head.\n\nuse your walk key instead! it's shift by default",

You should almost always be shift walking (by pressing the shift button) which is better since you move faster than crouch walking(by pressing the control key). The only time you should crouch walk is when you have a good idea somebody is in a corner and want to throw off their aim by crouching- this is known as a \u201ccrouch peek\u201d. Regardless, don\u2019t let random people\u2019s insults get to you, we were all beginners at some point!",

Walking is when you press a button (idk what it is on console) and you slow down while moving. it makes you quiet, but still has that default aim deviation. after that is crouch walking, which gives you a bonus to accuracy over moving and standing, but still not any different to just walking normally.\n\neither way the way you normally get kills is when you're standing still, so the only bonus crouching has comes from hiding behind cover or managing your bloom and recoil while holding down the fire button.",

You only walk with shift to be silent\n\nSo crouching, shifting to move then crouching again is what people would do\n\nCrouchwalking is like, very tilting because they know you could just shiftwalk",

This game is full of people who prefer complaining and coping over realising that their mistake allowed you to win. You'll never hear anyone say \"Damn. Nice play. I need to improve and start expecting x y z\". Being ratty and nerdy simply means you're outplaying the enemy, and it's a good thing as long as you win those rounds.\n\nOh, and by the way, shift don't crouch for silent walk. Don't do it when you're potentially exposing yourself to enemy thoughts, you become an easy target.",
