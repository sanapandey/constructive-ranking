    "selftext": "I'm low elo bronze 3 and the random players can be very annoying sometimes. I'm someone who like to open mic and talk, gives comms and ask for locations if someone dies early. But there are always 3-4 ,silent players in my team. I can understand if you don't wanna talk or don't have mic but atleast type in the chat or mark in the map. If I'm alive last and I'm doing good you can give me comms but no they always go silent. They won't listen or reply making the game very annoying sometimes. And the moment we are losing they open mic and start cussing othe teammates. Why even play a multiplayer game when you don't even wanna type in chat.\n  \nAnd just when you are doing decent in the game a smurf comes and ruin it. Whenever I play spike rush or swift play some 4-5 lvl raze, pheonix come and kill everyone or be the top Fragger. Why so many players want to bully the low elo players. And if you are grinding for your friend or anyone how will that help them if their skill is still low lvl. Those jett, reyna insta lockers are mostly smurfs i encounter every 3-4 game ",

To climb out of low elo/elo hell, your best bet is to focus on your own game play and not so much what your team is or isn't doing. It's great that you comm, but it's almost worthless in anything under +/- Gold, especially if your team stays silent. One thing that could help is to find a solid duo that you can play with/off of. If you're solo queueing, honestly, bait team mates and swing off of them - learning to trade your team mates is critical once you start climbing into higher elo.\n\nIf you have a toxic teammate, just mute them because all they're gonna do is bring your mental down and tilt you and its not worth it especially if you want to climb because your mental has more of an impact on your gameplay than you think. Ive had games where I went in with the best mental and a toxic teammate would talk smack and i would end up underperforming because I let some troll get under my skin.\n\nFocus on fixing mistakes by VOD reviewing yourself and thinking about how you could've done something better/more efficiently. Also, having a warm up routine before you queue comp will definitely make a difference over time - just make sure you focus on areas you're weak in (cross hair placement***, movement, positioning, etc).\n\nAnd above all, just try to have fun, it's a game after all. When you get so wrapped up in performing well, your body can become tense to where the slightest mistake will trigger you. Just relax, enjoy the game, and learn from your mistakes.\n\nHope this helps",
