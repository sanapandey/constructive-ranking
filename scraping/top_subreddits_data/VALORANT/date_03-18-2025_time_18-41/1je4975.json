    "selftext": "IMHO has a point on this when he claims that to many players are just spamming sites with their abilities so defending a spot often becomes nearly impossible when that happens.\n\nThe guns aren't IMHO precise in general because sometimes it feels like shooting half of a magazine on an oponents head instead of just one bullet to get a headshot even if you're aiming on its head. But that might be highly subjective as in my opinion should always hit where the crosshair is until you make it more realistic by putting wind conditions and other things into factor.\n\nTo be clear: I don't talk about good or bad aiming. I'm talking about that the first bullet should always be 100% precise regardless in which firemode you shoot",

We went from metas that were heavy on Chamber, Jett and Kayo; two agents that are very much about precision gunplay and one that silences abilities, to a meta with a bunch of util for site hits and post-plants. \n\nSentinels like KJ and Cypher who are pretty much 100% defensive are pushed out because holding site is impossible, so proactive util like Deadlock/Vyse is favored (mark my words that net becoming a rechargeable is gonna be huge for pro play). Alternatively, a lot of teams don't even run a sentinel anymore. Duelists like Iso and Yoru becoming meta has also been devastating, because both have ults and util that make defending against a hit hell. If Waylay turns out to be good in pro play that's another huge site-hit ult.\n\nIn addition, the combined strength of Tejo and Breach has almost completely pushed out initiators like Sova, Kayo and Gekko, who are also (relatively) light util on site hits. Not to mention that Riot nerfed both Omen *and* Viper during the double controller meta, which already pushed us more towards double duelist/double initiator metas.\n\nI don't like this direction for the game either, but I think there are more constructive and informative ways of saying that than to just rehash some memeified soundbyte from 5 years ago.",

Stuns are even made fun of for being cosmetic because they aren\u2019t strong.

It's not just about who can click heads the fastest, there's an entire gameplay in using your abilities/util correctly, combine it, etc. That's what makes the game so alive, for me.\n\nYes, it is annoying when you're trying to defend site and then you're Skye dogged, Omen blind, Tejo missile \u2014 But that's the point. On the other side, it feels completely satisfying when you or your team get a kill from a correctly used util. There's a certain satisfaction I felt when I killed someone using Tejo missile after they get stunned by Breach.\n\nAiming are still a major part of the game, but abilities are also a major part. It's really 50-50. If you want a game where aim is 90% of the gameplay, then there's like thousands FPS games out there.",

You can\u2019t just sit on site, do nothing, eat a site\u2019s hits worth of util and still expect to get two. That\u2019s just not how the game works.

But in Premier, everyone is just running the most annoying agents, making the game unfun since people abuse utility to the max.
