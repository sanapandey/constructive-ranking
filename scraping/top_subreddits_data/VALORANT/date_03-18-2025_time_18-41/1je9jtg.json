Rewarding bad micro-adjustments to land on the body and give you a false sense of accuracy?\n\nBeen playing for years and always hated the role of 'luck' in a game which promised 'precise gunplay'.\n\nNow i know that it only happens sometimes, and its lesser in a few guns, but I still stand with my argument.\n\nThe fact that you can win or lose a round, which may lead to you winning or losing an entire match just because of first shot inaccuracy still kinda makes me confused on the state of \"precise gunplay\" of valorant.\n\nYour opinions?",

Sniper weapons are intentionally given an accuracy advantage at long ranges compared to rifles because you are rewarded for using the proper weapons at the proper range. Outlaw should always hit whist rifles sometimes can miss but should be a generalist strong option.",

Though spread is not anything major, it is clearly noticable.\n\nAnd imo, if you 'ego peek', you either get shut down or you shut down someone else. It should be a level and fair fight in terms of accuracy for each person i'd say. If you're ego peeking, you're already at a disadvantage of using no util, or any other disadvantages possible. But what you shouldn't be at a disadvantage is in accuracy. If you somehow manage to react earlier than your opponent and lineup your crosshair on their head and shoot, you should be given your kill. Not 'rewarded' with first shot inaccuracy, but 'given' what you earned with your aim.\n\nI understand that Valorant is made for unfair fights where util plays a major role, but i think we stuns, flashes and other moving objects like drones and dogs are more than enough to break your enemy's aim and that one should not hope for first shot inaccuracy to win a duel",

You shouldn't be doing it in the first place as it goes against the concept of more methodical and precise gameplay (there are other complaints on this about the game no doubt). But if you're gonna stand out in the open and risk a long range duel knowing that first shot inaccuracy exists, it's on you. \n\nI think a counter point to your first shot inaccuracy argument is why do we not just go to the extreme and make every shot accurate to award crosshair placement the most? Why have any variance at all? \nYou'll find that the best games/activities with high skill ceilings have a wide spectrum on what \"variance\" is. In poker, an untrained player is essentially just gambling because they essentially leave is to chance (ego peeking in this case). A high skilled player knows how to approach a win using various strategies to minimize their risk while maximizing their odds of winning (using util, advantageous fights only, trading). \n\nTldr: It adds a degree of fun lol",

By removing First shot inaccuracy, the sniper would become a large risk large reward kinda gun, where if you were skilled enough to land EACH shot on the head, you would be rewarded accordingly. \n\nNow obviously if you miss your first shot, you'd be dead if the enemy could aim, so that kinda promotes you to aim better ig?\n\nBut this post was made towards other guns like the sheriff, ghost, vandal etc, where first shot inaccuracy is kinda annoying. Imagine spending 800 creds for a sheriff on pistol (meaning you don't have any extra util) and die because the gun was inaccurate and worse, the enemy was not even aiming for you and still killed you.",

Classic is low accuracy but compensates it with the right click and the utility you can buy. Ghost is the middle way by being the most accurate pistol and at least some kind of utility. Sheriff is full aim, no util, which (when everybody does it) undermines the concept of a tactical FPS. No util just gun would be potential scenarios for the removal of first bullet inaccuracy, which makes no sense for the intention of the game.\n\nFor Vandal and Phantom we\u2018d experience another Phantom nerf when the inaccuracy is gone. We got a Phantom buff just recently and by making the first bullet on the vandal 100% accurate we\u2018d just revert these changes. Makes no sense imo.",
