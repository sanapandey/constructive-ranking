I might be *hoping* the accusations turn out to be true or false depending on the accused, but if the courts and law process works as it should -- good, fucking go after 'em.

Officers arrested Eichorn without incident outside his vehicle near Normandale Avenue. He was booked into the Bloomington city jail, where he remains in custody.\n\nEichorn, who represents Grand Rapids, has served in the Minnesota Senate since 2016 and is described in his official biography as an entrepreneur and family man with four children. His arrest has sent shockwaves through state politics, with Senate Republican Leader Mark Johnson saying he was still gathering information and would comment later. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy called the allegations deeply troubling and said they raised serious questions for Eichorn\u2019s colleagues and constituents.\n\nThough he has not yet been formally charged, the case has already drawn widespread attention. Authorities have not released further details, but more developments are expected in the coming days.",
