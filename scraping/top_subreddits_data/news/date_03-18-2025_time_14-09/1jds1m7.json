Especially since he's so paranoid and narcissistic that he hasn't even really tried to groom a proper heir to his dynasty. And what I can imagine is about a dozen people scrambling to take his place and hastening the fracturing of his base as the morons try to figure out if they want Vance, Musk, or Trump Jr to be their next god king.",

Protecting everyone close to you from a sideshow freak who wants to hurt you however he can because the man holds grudges for life. He\u2019s still talking about Clinton and Obama. \n\nHunter Biden, who never served in office was attacked because Club MAGA spent 4 years looking for dirt on Joe Biden and couldn\u2019t find anything. And even after gaining access to his personal laptop, what did they find on Hunter? He lied on a gun permit application and paid his owed taxes a year late. \n\nThe Russian informant, Alexander Smirnov, who the GOP claimed had evidence against Joe Biden, just pled guilty to making up everything! \n\nThe subject of this post is all about Agent Orange wanting to get revenge against anyone he feels wronged him. Protection from that is a good thing. Biden didn\u2019t just pardon his family, he pardoned dr. Fauci, Republican Liz Cheney, and other people who were targets of Trump. \n\nNow, if you want to talk about pardons that are wrong AF, how about the January 6th defendants??? I\u2019m talking about the ones who actually beat police officers. Some of those people already had serious criminal charges and convictions before Jan 6th. How about pardoning people for money? When Trump left office he pardoned people such as hip-hop artist Lil Wayne for his gun conviction. He did the same for several other rappers. What did they all have in common? They are all millionaires who asked Trump for a favor. Trump who is not a billionaire and is still desperately trying to get his hands on as much cash as he can as if he\u2019s planning on being on earth for another 100 years. \n\nThe man is still begging his sheep for money to pay his legal bills. Strange though, almost a dozen former lawyers of his say they have never been paid for their services. Instead, several of them have been reprimanded for filing frivolous and deceptive cases for Trump. \n\nFrom selling $300 ugly sneakers to the Trump meme coin, the man will do anything for money. 2018 he had to pay $25 million to the victims of his fake Trump University. Another money grab scam of his.\n\nLast year Trump had to pay a bond amount of $175 million. Since he\u2019s not really a billionaire, he had to borrow the money from an actual billionaire, Don Hankey. Why did he have a bond? Because he was found guilty in NY for lying on multimillion-dollar bank loan applications for decades. It\u2019s a crime that usually sends regular people to prison but Trump was only charged in civil court.",

I get it, you\u2019re all Club MAGA and so you\u2019re having a difficult time dealing with facts you don\u2019t like. \n\nNobody other than you mentioned Mar-a-Lago but since you brought it up, heres the little big fact you failed to learn. The property could be worth well over $100 million but it isn\u2019t. Why? Because when Trump bought the property he changed the classification of the property so he could turn it into a business to profit from. In doing so, he lost the right to sell the property as a residential property and for anyone to EVER be able to develop or make changes to the property. \n\nBelow is more information copied from a Newsweek article. You can google yourself and find the clear-as-day facts about the deal he made and why he did it\n\n\n\u201c\"What really diminishes the value of that property is an easement that he signed with the National Trust for Historic Preservation,\" Mary Shanklin, the author of American Castle: One Hundred Years of Mar-a-Lago, said in a Tuesday interview. \"That's what kills any potential market value.\"\n\nIn 2002, amid financial headwinds, Trump signed a deed easement that allowed him to turn the 17-acre resort from a residential property into a club. The easement essentially allowed Trump to turn Mar-a-Lago into new streams of income and benefit from tax breaks granted by the estate's new status. Financial disclosure forms show that between 2017 and 2019, Mar-a-Lago brought in over $69 million.\n\nTrump initially drew up a plan to subdivide the property in the 1990s, but the proposal was met with significant pushback from the Palm Beach community who did not want the town's \"residential hood ornament\" to become a club, Shanklin said.\n\nInstead, Trump decided to turn it into a club by giving locals the protected easement, which states that \"the Club and Trump intend to forever extinguish their right to develop or use the Property for any purpose other than club use.\"\n\nWhen asked about the language on Monday, the former president said, \"'Intend' doesn't mean we will do it,\" calling it \"bravado\" and not \"legal intent.\"\n\nBut Shanklin said Trump was aware of the financial risk that signing the easement could pose to him down the road.\n\n\"He knew that once it was signed, it would really quelch the values of their property,\" she said. \"Seventeen acres that go from the Atlantic Ocean over to the intercostal waterway in Palm Beach\u2014if it didn't have that kind of handcuff on it, probably it could go for $100 million, much more than that even.\"\u201d",

The point is you can\u2019t give false information on bank loans. It\u2019s called fraud.\n\nJames did not asses the value of the property. The judge did and he did so using the actual property records:\n\n\u201c\u201cFrom 2011-2021, the Palm Beach County Assessor appraised the market value of Mar-a-Lago at between $18 million and $27.6 million,\u201d Engoron wrote in his ruling.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re going to try and argue, why not do your homework instead of spitting out BS?!?!\n\nTrump is a conman! His old cons literally came back to bite his old crusty ass. A big part of his scam has been to raise the value when it comes to loans and drastically decrease the value when it comes to taxes.",

Republicans have absolutely ZERO spine and are more than happy to do nothing for 2 years collecting a salary and receive perks. Dems are even worse since all they seem to be doing is going on Twitter and complaining or holding up signs. \n\nSince congress is so divided, and Trump already set up a right leaning supreme court before he left office, he can do whatever he wants. Congress is doing nothing to stop a non elected official from tearing apart the country. I strongly believe the dems gameplan is to do nothing, watch it all burn down and then get voted in on the next election to do the cleanup (only for the right to blame the left for all the country's issues Trump left is with and the cycle continues).\n\nWe are legitimately on the tipping point for what the US and global geopolitical world will look like. Will we return to a form of modern authoritarianism or will we maintain whatever we have left of democracy. There will be a moment that starts ww3 just like the other two world wars. And ww3 will be rooted in a fight of political ideologies. And unfortunately at least half of the US have drunk the kool-aid\n\nThe most ironic part in all of this is the Republicans will be the first people to call foul when the next dem president starts doing anything.

But it's extremely difficult to whip liberals up into a frenzy. And if you did manage to get him into a frenzy it's a pretty important reason why. \n\nSo a country has a huge problem with gathering statistical data after crimes. And as much data as they gather one deliberate blind spot is politics. \n\nI really truly truly want to know what the statistical correlation of a person's opinions and political affiliations are as well as their personal interests and media prior to having committed some of the largest mass shootings in this country. Or even politically motivated shootings. I'd love to look at all that data. \n\nCurrently all I have is my own confirmation bias. But that bias leads me to an opinion that the majority of these kinds of crimes are committed by triggered conservatives. And they're going after targets that they're instructed to repeatedly by radio and TV. Yet if you listen to the listen to the folks in the Senate you might be misled to believe that this never happens and it only happens on the left which is not only misleading but downright dangerous. \n\nWhich is why I'd like to actually see real data gathered by say the FBI and the CIA and see what those statistics really look like when it's actually been gathered all the way through.",

Andrew Carnegie offered to endow a US$25,000 (equal to $814,569 today) annual pension for former chief executives in 1912, but congressmen questioned the propriety of such a private pension. That prompted legislation to provide benefits to former presidents. Although legislation was first introduced later that year to provide any such benefits, that legislation was not enacted.[2]\nWhen the Former Presidents Act took effect in 1958, there were two living former presidents: Herbert Hoover and Harry S. Truman. Dwight D. Eisenhower was the first president to fall under the act upon leaving office.\nThe original act provided for lifetime Secret Service protection for former presidents. In 1994, protection was reduced to ten years after leaving office for presidents inaugurated after January 1, 1997. This protection limitation was reversed in early 2013 by the Former Presidents Protection Act of 2012.[3]\nAll living former presidents and their spouses after Dwight D. Eisenhower are now entitled to receive lifetime Secret Service protection. Their children are entitled to protection \"until they become 16 years of age\n\nBetter?",
