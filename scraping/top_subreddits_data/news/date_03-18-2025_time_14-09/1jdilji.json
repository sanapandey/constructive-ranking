That's not really true except in extreme cases.    \n\nAnd many of them are not legacies, or at least not legacies at the same college.\n\nRather, they take a different course.   They send their kids to private prep schools with a good reputation for getting their kids into Ivy League schools and guidance counselor connections. They make sure their kids have private tutors to help them get the 4.0 that they need and load their schedules up. \n\nThe kids participate in sports and charity activities and all sorts of other things to pad their resumes and give them things to write about on College acceptance applications.   The recommendation of a coach helps the admission too. \n\nThey hire an admissions consultant to help them prepare the applications. \n\nAnd perhaps more important than anything else, they pay for their kids to get an intensive test prep course to make sure that their kid gets that 33, 34, 35 that they need to be competitive.",

Meaning your grade point average can be expressed as a number between 1 and 4.   Getting admission to an elite college requires \"straight A's\" i.e. a 4.0.  \n\nThe \"New England Corridor\" is a area that stretches very roughly from Boston down through Connecticut, New York, Easterm Pennsylvania, Maryland and Washington DC/Northern Virginia.     The area contains a much larger percentage than the national average of individuals with high incomes and or who are connected to wealthy families..   [For example, you can look at this list](https://datacommons.stanford.edu/ranking/Median_Income_Household/County/country/USA?h=geoId%2F06111&unit=%24) where the median average income for many of the counties in the area is $120k or more.   \n\nA \"legacy student\" is a student whose parents attended that same school. Most schools provide a slight bump to the admissions applications of students who are \"legacies.\"\n\nAn admissions consultant is *literally* a consultant that parents will hire and pay fees to to help their kid fill out college applications.  Sometimes tens of thousands of dollars.  I'm serious.   \n\nThe ACT is a college admissions test that is scored from 0-36, and a 33 Composite score puts a student at roughly the 98th percentile, and a 34 at the 99th percentile.  The SAT is a similar college admissions test graded from 0-1600, and a 1500-1520 puts you at the 98th percentile, and a 1530-156 puts you at the 99th percentile.",

I went to a Community College (run by the county I live in) and I literally just sent them an application and got an acceptance letter a few weeks later. I also got accepted to a second college (coincidentally in New England) called Johnson & Wales, but really had no interest in going there. I only applied because my mother forced me to because they weren't charging an application fee for some reason. But with that one, it was the same thing. I sent them an application and got an acceptance letter a few weeks later. I didn't do anything else.\n\nAs an aside, J&W accepting me was unexpected. My grades were very average and I never did any sort of extracurriculars. (No sports teams, no school clubs, etc. My mother wouldn't let me because she said I should be studying after school, not doing things unrelated to class work. As far as my mother was concerned, grades were the only thing that mattered.)",

Especially with the increases in international students  over the past decades.\n\nSimilar to say, Ferrari, Harvard (and similar brands) are mostly inelastic. They intentionally limit the supply. If they wanted to say, accept more people, they could easily do so. Unless you think there's not ~1700 students from families wealthy enough to afford sticker price (ignoring the people who qualify for need-based aid under the current setup).\n\nYou proposed an alternative solution.
