They'll win some and lose others, and by and large it all sort of works itself out. \n\nTSLA isn't one of those -- it's a vanity stock having a value set by tech bros who idolize Musk and investors who see a potential big return on their stupidity. Institutional investors aren't banking on Tesla's long term ability to somehow be bigger than every other manufacturing company on the planet combined. They're banking on Musk continuing to sucker idiot fanboys into propping up the stock value. \n\nThat's why the value is dropping -- Musk's gone too extreme and he's losing his techbro base, and the people who remain aren't wealthy enough to keep propping up the sales of the institutional investors seeing it as a time to exit.",

If Musk actually delivered on the things he promises, Tesla would be ushering in multiple paradigm breaking technologies within just a few years. That would justify a price beyond the peak.\n\nAnd, to be fair, Tesla and SpaceX both have ushered in more minor paradigm shifts. Electric cars at consumer scale and reusable rockets and a massive increase in launch frequency are huge things.\n\nBut also, Musk has been promising and failing at all the rest for 10 years or more. It doesn't come near to justifying the expectation that it's gonna happen anytime soon, or that Tesla or SpaceX will be the ones to reach the promised achievements.",

It got resurrected by bipartisan effort to keep funneling money to mostly Red districts through Boeing (SLS booster) and Lockheed (Orion). \n\n>If all the money the government dumped on SpaceX was dumped on NASA instead NASA probably would have gotten some amazing shit done. \n\nHighly unlikely. While a lot of tech and the expertise that Spacex used for building their Falcon and later Falcom9 rocket originally came from Nasa, these were mothballed technologies. For example the Merlin engine used on the Falcon rockets is based on the Fastrac program that was cancelled by Nasa in 2001.    \n\nIt was supposed to be used for low cost access to space, but Nasa leadership instead decided to keep pursuing hydrogen based booster designs that don't make sense from a physics or from a financial standpoint. The Isp advantage of hydrogen vs hydrocarbons look good on paper, but the engineering compromises quickly eat the margins, and the technology only makes sense once youre in orbit.\n\nYet no amount of wasted money (STS, Delta IV, X33, Delta-X) made Nasa reconsider the folly of using hydrogen to make it to orbit, and still keeps building the SLS for 4 fucking billion dollars per launch.\n\nAnd by the way, Nasa has actually been given more money than they requested for the SLS program. I grant you that it's not freely given, but very specifically addressed to be spent at the contractors with *the right* political connections.\n\nSo no, unfortunately it most likely would have resulted in even more waste. Spacex has been an amazing company with marvellous track record up until very recently. \n\nAnd fuck Musk for staining it with his rabid nazi antics, I just hope it survives the inevitable collapse of his house of cards.",

Starship is a moderately promising vehicle marred by an absolute clusterfuck of a mismanaged program. But his hypothesis that SpaceX increased the fuel load of the Starship to do a bigger retroburn to save on reentry heating is just not how that stuff works. \n\nUnless you nearly completely cancel out the orbital velocity (As in, several kilometers of dV, way more than increasing the fuel fraction can give you), increasing the retroburn means you fall into the atmosphere faster. If you fall faster into the deep atmosphere, you increase the stress and the peak heating on the vehicle. Its why Apollo needed to hit a very specific window on reentry, because if they dipped too deep into the atmosphere too fast, they'd get shredded apart from the G loads and burn to a crisp. Its also why the shuttle used a really gentle reentry profile: To smear out the heat flux on the heat shield tiles low enough that they wouldn't evaporate.\n\nStarship deserves plenty of criticism. In fact, let me make a few right now: \n\n- The whole 'catching the vehicle with the launch tower' is a gimmick that mainly looks cool. You don't actually save that much weight from skimping on the landing gear because you need to add an equivalent amount of weight to the catch pins. Furthermore it centralizes risks. If you fuck up a landing, you nuke your launch pad. \n\n- The program is incredibly haphazard. It consistently has problems that any engineer with even a small amount of foresight would point out. Evidentially no such engineer is in charge of the program because they keep having obvious problems that they then have to fix with dirty cludges that hamper their future tests. \n\n- Reliability has completely stagnated these past 2 years. Engines are still failing every single flight. Things that worked previously are now broken. Things that somewhat worked never got any better. It really feels as if they just accepted mediocrity: \"Yea, we're gonna lose 3 engines every flight. Its fine, we have like 30 of them so we can ignore that problem\". It smacks to me of a stressed out middle manager shifting important JIRA tickets to 'won't fix' just to look good on the Gantt chart.\n\nThere are several other good critiques you can make of Starship, but you won't find them in that article.",

But the legs are at the base while the pins are at the top. The base already has a convenient hard point because that's where the engines are. The entire rocket already needs to be strong enough to support high forces from the bottom, while the pins introduce significant flexing forces that needs bracing. \n\nFurthermore, since those pins and bracings are so high up on the rocket that it shifts the center of mass of the rocket. This makes it less stable during reentry and its probably partly why they need to dump the interstage right now.\n\nSo the benefits of pins are pretty minor. They probably gain a little bit of weight savings. But as a downside they are less stable during reentry and they make their whole launch infrastructure incredibly brittle. One small mistake and their whole launch pad is down for months.",

But it does not depressure during the landing. They pressurize that booster to ensure that the fuel gets pushed into the turbopumps after all, that means they need pressure all the way to the ground.\n\nSo no, it would not crumple when landing on legs. The main concern is that with short stubby legs, you get acoustic waves from the engine exhaust reflecting back into the engine bay and wrecking shit during the last few seconds of landing. But there is a very easy fix for that, which is to just land the booster/ship over a flame trench. After all, they only use the center engines during landing and they have demonstrated the required accuracy to land on a landing pad with a small flame trench in the middle.

Some of my tech-bro friends defend the Tesla stock price by saying \u201cbut when they release the full self driving, they\u2019re gonna be way ahead of everyone else!\u201d And then I point out that companies like Waymo are already way ahead of them in that department. But that doesn\u2019t temper their enthusiasm. \n\nPersonally I think they\u2019re gonna have a huge problem with Teslas only using optical sensors for FSD, and not something like LiDAR. There was a recent story about Tesla\u2019s self-driving getting tricked by a Wile-E coyote style painted tunnel and running into it at full speed, which demonstrates the limitations of optical-only sensors for self-driving",

I mentioned the EV1 to dispel any myths that Tesla was the lone pioneer in EVs, but I agree that it was not a desirable vehicle (e.g., low range, high price, no back seat, etc.).\n\nI am not sure that I understand the difference between a new product versus a new market in this context. It is not like Tesla was convincing people who didn't drive to suddenly buy cars. They were convincing people who were already in the new car market to buy a different type of car. I suppose there is room for lots of nuance there with those terms.\n\nI think that GM had (and still has) a strategy. The Volt was a \"bridge technology\" between gasoline and electric vehicles - providing the benefits of *both,* without requiring special infrastructure or lifestyle sacrifices. Then the Bolt was very affordable - much less than anything that Tesla offers - while still being practical. Now they are bringing what they have learned into their other vehicles with an affordable common \"Ultium\" platform.\n\nIn contrast, Toyota is standing there like idiots with their fingers in their ears, ignoring their customers and insisting that consumers will want gasoline cars forever.\n\nOf course, the most serious threats right now are the Chinese manufacturers. Because of massive subsidies and state protectionism, they are able to offer deals that free-market manufacturers cannot match. While I think that punitive remedies like tariffs are appropriate, I think that our own government should have a similar domestic policy that helps out domestic producers.",

I agree. GM was very transparent about their development of the Volt - starting in 2007 - and they had considerable opposition from within their own company. It took an influential executive \"car guy\" (i.e., Bob Lutz)  to make the Volt a reality.\n\nIf the company had been \"all in\" with EVs (as Tesla was), I imagine that GM would have a much larger market share now.

That itself was what made them so revolutionary. \n\nI would go as far as saying that they got this desirability in spite of their environmental benefits, rather than because of them.\n\nI think this was totally revolutionary, and nobody else was trying to do that. HOnestly, nobody has even really been able to ride the coat tails on Tesla and pull off making EVs as desirable, and I think it will take a long time to fill the gap that Tesla have left. \n\nI think the desirable EV gap will be filled, but it was the really bloody brave marketing from Tesla that enabled this.",

The other cars that I mentioned included many sacrifices to performance, range, styling, capability, etc. to make them affordable and practical.\n\nI remember Tesla (Musk) talking about the Model S early on. The company acknowledged that the price was out of the range of most buyers, but they wanted to demonstrate to the public that an EV could be a desirable vehicle on its own merits. Once the wealthy buyers paid for the R&D, then Tesla could work on more affordable models for the rest of us. And that is what they did. The Model 3 is currently one of the most affordable cars over its life cycle of any car (electric or gasoline) in the USA market.\n\nAt this point, I think that the best thing that could happen to Tesla would be for them to oust their CEO or to be sold to a major manufacturer who is really committed to electric vehicles. I hate to say this, but politics being what they are, a major manufacturer in Japan or Germany would be a good candidate, simply because their governments have beneficial industrial policies that allow exporters to compete somewhat fairly.",

They also would have made a car that people actually WANTED, instead of something that looked like a shitbox on wheels.  Plus, battery technology of the time made it so that the range of these things were anywhere between 55 and 105 miles (using modern range estimates vs. what they had at that time), using batteries that were either lead-acid or NiMH.  The problem with those battery technologies is that they don't like being pumped with oodles of direct DC current to fast charge, so the only way to do it was to slow charge them.\n\nEV was always a chicken-or-the-egg thing where the bigger the batteries got, the longer it took to charge them, but there's no charging infrastructure so there's nowhere to charge them apart from your house, and it takes 2 days to charge my 135mi EV from 15% to full using a wall-charger.

They simply can't produce enough vehicles, no matter how incredible they could be.  \n\nEven if every Tesla was paid fully by the government, and had perfect self driving with zero issues, and were the safest vehicles ever designed, and were the sexiest and fastest cars, and you could play Cyberpunk 2077 in it all the time, and they had infinite range with solar panel paint technology..... they can still ONLY sell so many because they are gated by manufacturing. \n\nTech doesn't have that same issue because you can make a game or software once and sell infinite copies and never worry about running out, but Tesla, no matter how good they are, no matter how much the hype tries to make you think otherwise, can never do the same. \n\nAlso, SpaceX has nothing to do with Tesla, unless you are treating Tesla stock as a meme stock to show support for Musk. Which is what they market Tesla stock as, but Space X is it's own totally separate entity who's only connection is the shared CEO; SpaceX isn't even a publicly traded company. \n\nAnd that's best case scenario. I agree that at one time Tesla WAS a paradigm shifter; without Tesla, I do think we'd be way behind the curve as far as electric charging stations and electric car adoption in general. But their lead is shrinking dramatically, and they are refusing to innovate; rejecting LIDAR which is far more effective than optical cameras ever will be, killing their supercharger department which throttles the amount of charging stations available to consumers, Tesla's are the most dangerous vehicles on the road. And competitors are picking up that slack, making electric trucks and cars that have better range, better build quality, and cheaper prices, and other companies are developing better self driving.",

I did some calculations a few weeks ago to try to put Tesla's insane stock price into perspective. I used the made up measure of company value per vehicle sold. All other car companies were in a very similar range. Tesla was about 50 times overpriced. Another way to look at the numbers was that if Tesla sold had a complete monopoly and sold *every new car manufactured on the planet each year* and we assumed the same company value, it would *still* be overpriced. So if Tesla did everything Elon claimed, won complete market dominance over all car sales on the planet, it would still be overvalued. Where is there room to grow?\n\nI'm not saying Tesla wasn't a fantastic company and pushed the boundaries a decade ago but they've done very little of value to innovate since then and since Musk fell of the rails a few years ago, they've literally done nothing. Aside from the mobile garbage can, their models are all very old and there isn't even a hint of anything new or groundbreaking anywhere on the horizon. Meanwhile the other car manufactures have all caught up and surpassed Tesla a while ago and now the Chinese manufactures are leap frogging them.\n\nTesla had a great idea and pushed boundaries in acceptance of electric cars in people's heads but has had a lot of growing pains becoming a mainstream large scale manufacturer. Meanwhile the existing large scale manufacturers have spent the time to shift their decades worth of manufacturing experience towards the trend of electric cars and at this stage, most of the other 'big' brands have had a decade worth of experience selling full electric vehicles.",

The question is whether \"by how much\" was ever REALLY realistic just in and on itself.\nLet alone now (and I am not even factoring in the \"Elon factor\") that there is ample time and hard evidence of past promises that fulled the past expectations of coming reality all woefully not materializing remotely on schedule or volume?\n\nAt a certain point of overvaluation the only reality that can satiate the fiscally expressed expectation is \"having a decade long monopoly that literally every human NEEDS to buy in at any cost they can remotely absorb\".\n\nThe bigger the bubble, the less liberal the possible futures that can deliver on it. And the less allowed are datapoints that contradict that.\n\nEven IF they were to (against all past experience) magically manifest self driving, how long would they need to be able to capitalize on that how hard before losing that advantage?\nJust going \"well if they are first it is automatically worth it regardless how inflated\" isn't practically real.",

Oh, and you can talk to it with ChatGPT! So innovative!\n\nLiterally any of Tesla's most 'useful' technologies could be outsourced to other companies and actually make it to market, but marketing them perpetually as 'the future' is better branding for them. All of them are such general use that they can't come up with a single actual marketable use for any of them. Who the fuck wants a robot butler? Who the fuck wants a battery storage kit that doubles as a bomb in a pinch? \n\nTheir electric semis are so inefficient that most trucking operators don't even consider them - even considering that trucking depots don't normally have the infrastructure to charge them, it turns out that adding a bunch of 'charging stops' to a semi route doesn't really help in an industry that generally forces its drivers to develop a caffeine addiction to make time as it is. \n\nTheir solar panels might as well have the Supreme logo on them for all the fucking good it does them. They're literally on-par with baseline consumer panels, but almost FIVE TIMES more expensive, even without the power brick - A home install for 3KW consumer panels + storage is less than $4k, with Tesla's equivalent being almost $20k for a 3KW install. \n\nIt's psychotic. The vibes are terrible. Their direct 'competition', Rivian, trades at $10-$15, and honestly? They're worth more to the world than Tesla ever would be, even if they weren't being led by Hitler's #1 cheerleader.",

The pricing is still noticably different on a per-panel basis, but you're right - not by nearly as much as I thought. There's still no justification for the price difference.

When I bought they were about 15k for the first one and a few thousand cheaper for each additional one you get. I was initially considering other installers in spite of the price difference but as of now there isn't a battery on the market that's better than the powerwall and they were way more expensive from third party retailers. \n\nThe reason they won't just sell you the panels is because they don't make their own panels like Panasonic or REC. They sell rebranded Qpeak/qcell panels which you can already buy from many retailers. \n\nAlso the links you sent said about 10k for a 4kW system. Not sure where you were getting 20k from. If that included a powerwall that's a very good price. \n\nAnd the link you sent for the 3k system for 3k is nowhere near comparable to what tesla would install. That's no-name rv panels. Tesla sells qcells which are a major, reputable Korean brand. The configuration and maintenance via their app is better than any other system with the exception of Generac. And that Amazon system doesn't come with racking or any way to install it on your roof or any of the wiring/conduit to tie it into your home system, nor the permits. And if you're getting a battery, they install a whole separate panel for the loads you want backed up. The panels are easily the cheapest part of a solar system. The installation and if you get them, batteries, are the bulk of the cost. \n\nComparing a turnkey price for a system from Tesla (or any solar installer using top shelf panels) to a glorified RV system on Amazon with no installation or install materials is not an apples to apples comparison at all.",

A wise manager explained to me that we do our customers no favors when we add features or robustness into our products in excess of what the customer requires. We drive up the price and the operating costs of the product, we reduce its reliability, and we delay its delivery for no significant benefit to our customers.\n\nTo that end, LiDAR makes no sense when the mass-market customer wants an affordable EV for a price that is similar to equivalent gasoline cars. Cameras and image recognition are good enough for Level 2 or Level 3 automation in most scenarios.\n\nHowever, for Level 4 or Level 5 automation, I agree that current camera image recognition technology is inadequate.

All of the FAANGS are between 20x to 55x. Tesla was at like 160x to 170x at one point (I even saw a reference a few years back where it was much higher, but I haven't verified).\n\nThat's NUTS, especially when it's probably more realistically valued as a car company stock, at around 7x. Particularly when it is quickly not nearly as innovative - most every major western or Japanese car company is working on EVs, better battery tech is even being produced for cheaper by BYD, etc.\n\nAnd Musk basically pissed off his core demographic - I considered a Tesla before, hell even after he started being an asshole, I might have been open to it, though already by then I was sorta thinking, \"ehhhhhhh\"\n\nThen he started dismantling the federal government and giving Nazi salutes. Nope, no fucking way. Not a chance I am ever seen driving a Tesla",

Most stocks are based on a legitimate multiple of earnings valuation, within a widely understood and rational range of multiples for companies of similar types. There are some stocks, like Tesla, which get uncoupled from those grounded valuations due to some (rational or irrational) belief that they don't conform to the rationale behind their industry's valuations and have growth potential that exceeds their industry norms. For example, car manufacturers (the closest real proxy to Tesla) typically get valued anywhere from 2 to 12 times EBITDA, depending on the health and growth of the company. Toyota is currently valued at ~6.5x EBITDA.  \n\n  Tesla has achieved valuations at multiples of EBITDA exceeding 200. That is deeply irrational, and a very predictable valuation bubble. Tesla would need to achieve astronomical growth in market share in order to justify that kind of valuation, when in fact their market share is now looking to be a declining metric. This stock is going to continue to tank, and in a fully predictable manner. Anyone who was buying Tesla stock at a >200x multiple of EBITDA was a chump. You don't need hindsight bias to know the company was wildly overvalued. This isn't a \"all stocks are uncoupled from legitimate valuation\" issue. This is a \"Tesla specifically was uncoupled from legitimate valuation, and nobody should've been buying it at the prices that they were\" issue. Most stock prices are rooted in largely-rational basis. People love to fixate on fringe cases like Tesla because they're interesting, but they're interesting *because* they're anomalies.",

If the other manufacturers exceed the fleet carbon emissions limit, and it seems like they all intentionally did that together by ending most of their sedan runs and focusing on trucks, they have to go to Tesla to buy carbon credits.\n\nIt's a privatized financial market that Musk took and with cooperation with the other manufacturers created a system that let them all increase their profits while flaunting the carbon emissions regulations. They found a way of making money off of a regulation that was supposed to decrease pollution.\n\nAnyone that buys a truck helped the manufacturer of that truck pay for the carbon credit they had to buy because that fleet of trucks puts them over the emissions limits.\n\nIt's like a domestic tariff and Musk offered a government sponsored coupon for that tariff. The customer then adds the cost of the tariffs and the coupon to the cost of their product even though they are getting the money from the coupon back. They can even sell the coupons back to Tesla when they decide to make electric cars and get the coupon from the government themselves. But they only do that when Tesla can't afford to keep taking losses on their cars so they need to decrease production.\n\nI am sure there is a fucking huge anti Trust violation involving Musk. He needs to end the aspects of the government that can punish him for it, but keep the parasitic host alive.\n\nPerhaps he needs to do this now because Tesla cannot afford the rare earth minerals for the batteries on their cars, hence the extortion with Ukraine for theirs, and Musk cannot keep up with the cycle and he will not be able to sustain the model he has that has been working.",

Mush himself has said that solving self-driving is the difference between Tesla being one of the most valuable companies in the world, or being basically worthless.\n\nThat said, the stock was pumped so far beyond having that advantage priced in, and also Tesla only has that head start if people keep buying and driving Teslas, which they aren't due to Musk's politics.\n\nMy theory is that Musk's primary goal with his aggressive politics is to strip away regulations that are slowing down FSD, and to divert money into SpaceX, which he owns a huge portion of compared to Tesla.",

Tesla stocks did get a massive gain after the election due to speculation since Elon became the US president owner. Had he done nothing other than turn all contracts to himself things would go amazing for him.\n\nBut alas the Trump administration is a massive failure that is isolating the US economically which is why all the gain after the presidency was already lost and then some because he is being directly tied to said failure and the Tesla grip on the EV market which was already kinda weak became nothing with various countries rejecting him due to him being a Nazi (plus China rejecting Tesla since his cars are shit)",

                                    "body": "A stock in a long running company typically gains its value from two things: dividends and voting rights.\n\nDividends are portions of profits paid out to shareholders. Basically, when the company makes money the people who own the company get a portion of it in proportion to the number of stock shares they own.\n\nFor example, say a company makes $1 billion in profit and decides to disburse $100 million of that in dividends (while the remainder is reinvested into the company or used for some other purpose). If you own 10% of the shares, you would get $10 million from that disbursement.\n\nSo that is one reason a person might be willing to pay money for stock shares -- if you own shares in a company that regularly turns a profit, you might get these regular dividend payments (a lot of rich people essentially live off of these -- many simply inherit the shares and just get a check each quarter or whatever, and may not even completely understand where it is coming from).\n\nHowever, Tesla has *never* offered dividends on their common stock. So that is *not* a source of value for Tesla stock.\n\nVoting rights are just that -- shareholders get to vote in how the company is run. This can vary a bit, but most commonly shareholders elect the Board of Directors, whose job is to monitor the company and make sure things are running the way the shareholders want them run. \n\nThe Board of Directors will then typically hire the executive management for the company (ie hire a CEO, CFO, and other executives to actually run the day to day operations of the company). \n\nSometimes there may be overlap -- for instance, one person may be both CEO *and* Chairman of the Board, and even if an executive isn't technically on the Board of Directors they are often given lots of stock and thus become influential shareholders who do get to participate in electing the Board, removing offending Board members, and so on.\n\nAlso, some company decisions require direct shareholder votes -- for instance, selling a company would typically require a shareholder vote, even if the executives and the Board of Directors want to do it.\n\nCrucially, however, the more shares you own, the more votes you get in these elections. It isn't *exactly* one to one (for instance, a person who owns 51% of shares can't absolutely overrule everyone else and do whatever they want -- there are rules to protect minority shareholders from some things), but for the most part it is: the more shares you own, the more votes you get.\n\nAnd therefore this is another source of value -- you get an enforceable say in how a company functions, and therefore you gain Power over anyone and anything affected by that company (and obviously powerful companies do affect a *lot* of people and things). So if, for example, a company essentially runs a town or a country, having voting rights in that company is functionally the same as being a government official in that town or country, and thus that is valuable in the same way people pay money to get elected to office (perhaps moreso, since you aren't democratically accountable to the people you affect but rather only to the shareholders...and even then you may have more say than other shareholders if you own more).\n\nTesla does have shareholder votes, but Musk and people loyal to him are overwhelmingly entrenched in the company and thus there isn't actually much possibility of voting for anything Musk doesn't already want to do. So the value of these voting rights is pretty questionable (either you agree with Musk and thus your guy is already in charge, or you oppose him but have no ability to do anything about it). So this is also not really a source of value for Tesla stocks.\n\nThere are some other cases where owning shares might have value (for instance, if a company is sold then the shareholders get paid, either by having their shares converted to shares in the new company and/or by receiving cash for them at a price negotiated during the acquisition), but these aren't really applicable to Tesla.\n\nSo Tesla shares don't have any real value in the material senses described above -- they don't get you a portion of Tesla's profits, and they don't allow you to meaningfully affect the way the company operates.\n\nThat means the share price is almost *entirely* a matter of irrational perception -- some people think Tesla is cool, and that owning something that says \"Tesla\" on it somehow associates them with that cool Tesla company.  And they are willing to pay hundreds of dollars per share for that (and likewise, people know other people think this and thus feel like they can buy these shares and then sell them to someone else for more, either because that someone else just likes the idea of owning something with the word \"Tesla\" on it or because that someone thinks they can find such a person).\n\nIt is essentially beanie babies, NFTs, pogs, or whatever other token you want to think of. It is valuable simply because, at the moment, other people think it is valuable (largely because they think other people think it's valuable). There is no tangible, material basis to it.\n\nWhich means there is no limit to what the value could eventually swell to, but also no real way to predict if and when it will collapse... because the value depends solely on the fickle, irrational perception of millions of people all over the world, and nobody really knows how to predict what millions of people all over the world will think over time.",

The startup culture that really paired itself with tech during the dotcom boom was all about developing an idea just enough that it needed to get bought out by a big corporation for competition reasons. Therefore, the stock price was all about short term gains, and boosting it as fast as possible to maximize this sale price. And because everyone with tons of money was in on it, it becomes a self-repeating cycle. Tesla, because of Musks conventions from PayPal and the early marketing, got lumped in with this type of stock valuation early, despite being a physical commodity company, mentioning they have very real costs and overheads and no expectation that the IP will be sold off. Unfortunately, at a certain point, that will have to change, but no investor wants to admit that while they are gaining money. At a certain point, Tesla stock was just a 'if you buy in, it'll go up' causing more to buy in, raising the price. Totally detached from the company and its products. The correction had to happen, and the recent issues seem to have been the catalyst.",

That is what Tesla is attempting to create and they have been unable to do so. Their tech is the only thing keeping the company viable, future tech. If it isn't going to happen then Tesla dies. \n\n>Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profits, but if, at any point, they conclude that\u2019s not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffl\u00e9 under a sledgehammer!\n\nThis is a quote from Elon. He knows that future profit from tech is the only reason they have the value that they have. That was from back in 2020. Tesla doesn't enough profit from anywhere else. Tesla profited 7.1 billion for 2024. Around a half a billion of that is just bitcoin going up and Tesla owned around half a billion at the beginning of 2024. 7.1 billion in profit for the year does not get you a P/E this high which is part of the reason why Tesla is worth so much even now.\n\nFor example, Ford has a P/E of 6.83. That is what is reasonable for a vehicle manufacturer. Without fully autonomous self driving then Tesla shouldn't be higher than a 10 for the P/E. Which means Tesla's stock is about 11-12 times higher than it should be without that tech. This is a total guess on my part but I'm guessing this latest update was part of attempting to stop their stock value from falling over a cliff.

No. Do the product managers cringe hard every time Elon goes on social media to make another stupid unrealistic promise re: FSD timeline? Definitely yes. \n\nBy any realistic means of measuring software product success, FSD(S) is a VERY successful and sophisticated product which has advanced rapidly. Has it fully solved the end-goal problem it set out to? No, and that\u2019s ok. \n\nThe rest about P/E ratios and valuation I don\u2019t care about because that\u2019s not what I was addressing.

Boston Dynamics is a Hyundai company, and Toyota runs one of the world's leading robotics labs: \n\n* [Hyundai Robotics](https://www.hyundai.com/eu/mobility-and-innovation/technology-and-innovation/robotics.html)\n\n* [Toyota Robotics](https://www.tri.global/our-work/robotics)\n\nHonda, of course, did Asimo for years and never had a \"robotics company\" valuation. Xiaomi has a good robotics program, sells a hundred million phones per year, hundreds of thousands of cars, and everything from tablets to smart watches to electric scooters to vacuum cleaners... and is 1/20th the value of Tesla. \n\nI understand you're alluding to this, but I really wanted to make the distinction formal: Tesla's valuation isn't from robotics, per se \u2014 it's from unrestrained irrational hype. Even if Tesla *genuinely had* a very successful potential robotics program that wouldn't justify their valuation.",

Twitter, if he had been crafty about it, and hoovered up a few other platforms also coulda worked. Like, if during the userbase he had at the start, he didn't touch the censorship/bans and rolled out a convenient and secure wallet function, ideally with some crypto conversion/compatability, he could have sneakily slithered into a level of ubiquity that even Paypal can't match. But instead, he got way too deep into hype and immediate money, and destroyed what could have been new dominant companies",

Our best AI systems require massive, internet-scale data, and whoever solves that problem will dominate the market. Waymo operates more like a system on rails\u2014it's highly constrained to very specific neighborhoods with near-perfect weather conditions year-round, and human drivers ready to intervene if needed. Because of this, its data is inherently limited in scope and doesn\u2019t translate well to more unpredictable environments.\n\nYou're saying Waymo\u2019s value is in its data, but more sensors don\u2019t necessarily mean more useful data. While I disagree with Tesla\u2019s camera-heavy approach, they are collecting far more diverse real-world driving data. Waymo, as a Google company, has likely been at this longer than Tesla, so they might have more data overall, but it comes from a relatively small set of environments using a variety of cars and sensor stacks.\n\nTesla\u2019s data, on the other hand, is valuable because it comes from a massive fleet using just a few types of vehicles and sensor configurations. That kind of data is really helpful for building better AI models, but it might be less useful when generalizing across different vehicle types.\n\nBasically, what I\u2019m saying is that Waymo\u2019s data, being more diverse in sensor technology but constrained to select locations, is probably more useful for automakers looking to develop self-driving systems adaptable to multiple vehicle platforms. Tesla\u2019s data, being more uniform but collected at scale from real-world conditions, is likely better suited for refining end-to-end AI models and simulated systems. Both have their strengths, but they serve different needs in the autonomy space.",

That said, even if the data is 10x better, Tesla still has more than 10x the data, by at least an order of magnitude.\n\nIt really isn't close at all, and there's a pretty big debate around whether LiDar is even necessary. LiDar can map an entire area down to the nearest half inch, regardless of visibility conditions, while Teslas only have 8 standard cameras. Humans only have 2 \"cameras\" though. The Tesla also has access to other sensors a driver can't.\n\nIf humans can figure out how to drive with just 2 eyes and some reasoning, it's certainly conceivable that we can get an AI to figure it out, at least to the level of a human driver, in which case LiDar is a waste of time and money, and diverse real-world data is going to win the race.\n\nPersonally, I'd rather that FSD is better than a human driver, and LiDar is probably the safest way forward. However, I think Tesla will probably crack their method before Waymo can catch up (Musk's politics permitting lol).",

You can just generate that data! Rather than trying to collect a kajillion miles of real-world data, which is slow and expensive, it turns out it's way simpler to collect ten thousand miles or so of data, and amplify that into *many hundreds of kajillions* of miles of simulated data \u2014 fast and cheap. Nvidia has a [great handful of videos on their youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsB7tGB5g-o) illustrating the principle in abstract.\n\nThis is also how Chinese robots you keep seeing pop up in the news [are learning so quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dFTc4W8wm0). There's no (or very little) real-world data used in the motion policy training. They're doing it *in a simulation*, with [a million times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sO7VS3q8d0) more data than you could ever generate in the real-world \u2014\u00a0even if you had millions of actual robots.\n\n>Is that missing a ton of nuance? Yeah. But the point is they're collecting real world driving data to train their ai on how to drive, not on how to identify the things outside the car.\n\nRight, you're saying the data isn't for image segmentation, but path planning. I'm saying the path planning bit isn't actually an advantage. That's the key here \u2014 the \"treasure trove\" you're talking about is fool's gold for the purpose you're describing.\n\nThat's what makes it a bubble. The advantage they say they have isn't an advantage at all, and that's why Waymo has deployed robotaxis on the streets *right now* while Tesla is still figuring it out.",

There\u2019s a bit of a sell\u2014off, but I doubt they can get rid of it that fast. They have to be incentivized to make the stock valuation go up (high sales numbers, earnings reports), instead of pump and dumping. TSLA doesn\u2019t behave like a normal stock at all, so it\u2019s hard to say what applies to it or not. The execs must still attempt to increase the stock\u2019s value, that\u2019s their entire goal: to enrich shareholders. Not buying stock typically means the shares are overvalued, and this is showing to be true for TSLA. But TSLA valuation is so convoluted that it is difficult to say for certain what the signaling is from the execs based on stock buybacks.",

I know non-Tesla owning Redditors love to pretend they\u2019d be willing to do that, but even being lucky enough to have the means to buy a Tesla, flushing $15,000 down the toilet is not something even decent earners can do when many of us have families and future savings to consider.",

It's really not clear to me what can save this bloated, sinking ship.  Corporations *used* to understand that getting political was a great way to tank your brand, which is why they hung out in the shadows, influencing things behind the scenes.  It seems that lesson has been forgotten by many of them, with TSLA leading the charge.\n\nI'm praying the irrationality doesn't take hold again and I'm pretty confident it won't.  Maybe this thing levels out at $150, but honestly I plan to hold onto these puts until the last day.  The damage here is done, and it seems pretty global in nature and entirely irreparable.\n\nI've also dropped my investments in every single company who has jumped on the anti-DEI train.  The right might see DEI policies as being political, and maybe they are, to some extent.  But these are *GOOD* politics.  Google?  Nah, dropped em.  Trash company.  Facebook?

Elon owns like 12% so he can be fired but if the board believes the stock price was always temporary then I doubt they will do anything until they have fully de-invested from the stock.\n\nI've heard most buyers of the stock are some kind of basket ETF. Like mutual funds buying into the top tech stocks since they propel US stock growth averages. So its going to be retirees who bear the brunt of the stock decline.\n\nAlso I think Elon saw the writing on the wall a long time ago. The self driving feature never materialized and I hear Kia and Hyundai have their own self driving tech being implemented now, and I hear it better. China is Tesla's #2 market, but the self driving gets auto ticketed on Chinese roads. One guy recorded himself getting 7 tickets that way. Oh and in some EU countries Tesla's cybertruck isn't road legal.\n\nThen there's the fact that Tesla costs too much. Chinese EVs are subsidized by the state, and the CCP immediately threw down road blocks on Tesla's 'giga-factory' he built there. Don't remember what, but the CCP is intent on killing Tesla's business in China for their own companies.\n\nIts also no coincidence that Elon bought his way into politics and the first thing he did was fire everyone investigating his companies. Elon made the 'Boring Company' and his hyper loops solely to steal tax funding away from public transit. Specifically California's attempts at high speed rail. I remember reading about some license that prevented Tesla from qualifying for some government program Elon got that fixed by walking into the office of the head agency. \n\n(Look into how Elon is moving his money out of Tesla and into Starlink. 90% of all mass shot into space was done by Starlink. There's nothing else as efficient. Though most nations seem to be prioritizing their own competitors now the USA is unreliable)\n\nOH right all the Government tax money Elon's businesses rely on and keep him afloat. If I were a betting man that's a major reason this con went on as long as it did. Years of Tesla failing to meet production targets, and continued quality issues should have sunk Tesla 5+ years ago.\n\nAnd Lastly I'll mention how so many people hate him and his company now. There's no getting rid of the stigma. Elon owns 12% of Telsa period, so the best way to kill his wealth is through Tesla. Changing CEO's won't change that.",

It would be hard for him to really get his money out of Tesla without crashing the stock. What he does get out of Tesla is a great deal of soft R&D and he has pillaged all of the top talent to come work for SpaceX. SpaceX is estimated to be worth 360 billion now and that is actually much closer to a real value than the share price of Tesla. Point being, when Musk considers his real wealth, that is in SpaceX. And I suspect he likes running a private company that builds rockets far more than a public company that is way overvalued.",

Am I that \"we\" and if so, who am I being sold to? The founders thought and fought for language which I now participate, so who is this \"we\"?\n\nLet me tell you something about this \"we, the people\" subscribed here in America. It is a newly-upgraded populace, now with global intelligence. Many feel AI is regional, with the old ideas about borders and protection. We all feel AI means Augmented Intelligence, and no one can restrict your intelligence.\n\nThere will always be a melting problem here in this pot. Do we have too much freedom? Part of that problem was that some people lived a different life, they simply decided how to live and that decision was different. How do I make them pay a little bit towards how I live and think?\n\nAugmented Intelligence helps here, you can ask it to replay your own life as someone else. Is Empathy a detriment or a virtue? Should humans born elsewhere have any rights at all? Empathy is knowing your part in history, and realizing you might be seen as a villain in the future. It takes a village to raise some adults.\n\nDivision makes us weak.\n\nThink about those you lost, and multiply their hopes and dreams. That is the promise of AI, augmenting our intelligence not by their slop but by their unique human contribution. We all add something.\n\nMy grandparents were raised divided and racist, because they were born white. Their perspective on the last world war, the American civil rights movement, the continuing immigration here due to our sand and current politics was slanted. Everyone crossing into democracy, through birth or border is new. How do we treat our new citizens?\n\nWho makes an American? If you have a child, who teaches them to be racist? Did you vote against the suffrage of women, should they be property? Do rich people deserve different, and more elevated rights than those struggling? We ask who we are.\n\nWe are we. Always have been, divided by special interests and their ambition, but rejoiced in the tiny gestures of unity. We never needed help dividing, but division creates an electorate.\n\nWe are the future, and the side-effects of that drug do not slow our progress. A king forcing cruelty does not make us strong. A king measures his foot, while stepping into his grave. We, as Americans, are people of strength. Eventually we will notice the weakness of division and rejoin the strength in unity.",

Those are merely details.  They're playing Top Trumps with stocks and when the stats aren't in their favour, they pull out.\n\nAnd they don't even care if a stock tanks.  So long as they're NOT the ones left holding the hot potato.  They love things artificially rising to stupendous multiples of their actual worth, especially unpredictably, because they can buy cheap and then sell when they see things drop FOR A LONG TIME, rather than have to react to every up and down.\n\nIf you bought Tesla cheap, for years now you could \"merely\" double your money at any point by just waiting until it tanks to that point, while also getting plenty of warning, and taking any extra that you can get in the meantime.  And there's a LOT of extra.  And you can also just cross your fingers and hope that it goes... 10, 20, 30x more in value.  It doesn't matter.  You won't lose money so long as you bug out before it becomes worthless.  And that's just not going to ever happen quick enough that those kinds of markets would lose money on it.\n\nThey're not in it for long-term investment like a pension fund (but those have invested too and are all now reconsidering that decision).  They're in it to make quick money on basically a 3- or 4- letter-named racehorse, and they will do, because if you have enough to spread the bets wide enough, you will make money like that short of a complete stock market crash (where the taxpayer will then bail you out anyway).\n\nThey couldn't care what the stock is or what people say it's worth or what backs it up or what comes up in the news.  All they care is that they need to notice before it tanks below what they paid for it (plus some healthy profit), and they'll have automatic sells way above that amount.\n\nStock markets aren't about long-term safe investment.  They're about making a quick buck, getting out before it tanks, and not being left holding a worthless pile of paper.  Once you realise that, the valuations for Tesla, the dotcom boom and bust, etc. all make sense.\n\nIt's not investment.  It's gambling.  And it's not even their money.  They don't care if they lose.  And, as in certain such stories in the news over the years, one person's gambling can bring down entire centuries-established banks (e.g. Barings Bank).  That guy then just gets a slap on the wrist (mostly because he tried to hide his loss illegally rather than just owning up to it).  If they'd admitted to it, they could have just been sacked and gone elsewhere, and nobody would ever have cared.  That same guy is now BEING PAID TO DISCOVER FRAUD in the stock market... they basically hired him back to find others like him.\n\nBut did anyone care that one single guy had the power to gamble with enough money to take down a bank established in 1762?  No.  It's just professional gambling.  They actually reward them with STUPENDOUS bonuses for playing those games when they're successful.\n\nThe stock market isn't what you think it is.  It's just a gambling den, bailed out by the government.",
