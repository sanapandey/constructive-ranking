It\u2019s not being political to talk about an issue that they care about, but it *is* being political as soon as it\u2019s about a group they don\u2019t really care much for. \u201cBeing political\u201d is just a dogwhistle for \u201cmaking me feel uncomfortable\u201d\n\nThe reality is that *every* public action is in a sense political. Sure, picking your nose in the car might not be political, or if you have broccoli for dinner vs peas, but all of the things surrounding these issues - from the most banal to the most significant - have tons of politics attached to them, whether directly or indirectly. Prices of goods, availability of goods, wages, work hours, transportation, healthcare, privacy\u2026 it\u2019s *all* political. All these rights that we have, these luxuries that we enjoy, are all the result of politics. There is no escaping politics. It might not be necessary to bring up politics when talking about your favorite soup, but, it\u2019s still there in some form.",
