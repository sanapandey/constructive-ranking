If so, I'd think keeping the chain pattern just on the front and back of the top should solve it. The legs shouldn't be an issue at least, judging by sunfire fanatic. We can't give up hope just yetttt",

The chainmail does look really slick :/\n\nI do really like the color schemes you proposed, but personally I also feel like the \"dragon red\" of the unkitted original set does feel quintessentially OSRS and feels like a celebration of the game's aesthetic identity in the same way that returning to the medieval platemail aesthetic does. I think it also makes the kitted version feel that much more impressive, and I'd love to see it with your proposed darker color scheme on the left. I don't think there are many who agree with me on that though haha",
