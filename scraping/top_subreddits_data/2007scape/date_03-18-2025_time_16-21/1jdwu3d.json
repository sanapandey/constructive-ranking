Also the amount of detail is great; it\u2019s not as busy as the original WiP and it looks clean. It also works with both Scythe kits. The holy kit synchronizes with the main grey/white, and the sanguine kit synchronizes with the dark red detail, and makes for a good contrast to the grey/white. Also, the blue trim, chains, and flames looks insane.",
