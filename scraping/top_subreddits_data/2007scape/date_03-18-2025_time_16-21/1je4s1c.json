At least it's good to see that the game is growing, although I can't say for sure if these increases are purely by price increases or actual increase in subscriptions. Probably can look back at where the prices increased and calc it out.",

Prices went up in may 2022 so its pretty fair to say its purely from the price increase.",

They said in the report that the decline in mtx revenue was due to a reduction in treasure hunter key purchases.\n\nThere's no breakdown to how much bonds contribute exactly, but osrs bonds surely make up a rather significant portion of their mtx revenue.",
