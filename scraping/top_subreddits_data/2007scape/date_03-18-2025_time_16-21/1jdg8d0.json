(Or is it that we're defying death? Idk in that case just call it Defiant Armour).\n\n- Big plume fan. The medieval influence is unexpected, but neat; The plume + the stripes on the legs and chest remind me of a [landsknecht's](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=landsknecht&t=fpas&iax=images&ia=images) attire. Could maybe be neat to lean into that with more contrasting colors and armour layers.\n\n- Respectfully, the face of the helm looks a little childish, especially the right variants' big angry eyebrows and zigzag spiky teeth.\n\n- The right variants more subdued colour palette makes it easier to read and look more appropriately end game. I was hoping for it to be a similar colour palette to soul runes, but hey we don't have any mauve-coloured armour currently.\n\n- I can't tell what the spikes(?) on the right armour's design is meant to be.

Gotta keep the market regulation up or it's going to be something you have to jump through hoops to acquire like some 3rd Age stuff or something.

The shoulder guards should be more asymmetric, considering the wearer is intended to use an oversized polearm, the right hand side should allow for more movement.\n\nThe head piece is strange to me, the opportunity to GO BACK to horned helms like the fremy helms is are right here!

There will be enough mixing and matching that a player will have full sets of both and see regular use.\n\nTorva has better crush defense (95%+ NPCs) while Soul has better slash defense (Vardorvis comes to mind). For ranged Torva is better and Magic Soul is better.\n\nAlso depending on your other gear, you'll want either 1 or 2 pieces of Soul armour on to maximize max hits and accuracy when slashing. Which piece(s) of Torva you use will be based on which defenses matter more",

They weren't going to sink years of development into something that wouldn't enter the game.\n\nThey mentioned continuing to work with the community and putting out feeler polls that could sway the direction they continue in but locking it in before development was something they always intended (and was pretty clear in the giga poll).\n\n[See question 6](https://secure.runescape.com/m=poll/oldschool/results?id=1671)",
