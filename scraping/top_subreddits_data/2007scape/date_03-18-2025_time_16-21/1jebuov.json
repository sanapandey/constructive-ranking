One of the big draws of the Hosidius patch is it's disease free, which is good because it's not very convenient to get to until you get a spirit tree planted. Same thing with the disease free patch on Trollheim, it requires a quest to access and it's inconvenient to get to without completing another quest for basalt teleports and getting 73 agility for the roof shortcut.\n\nAlso important is the disease free patches so far are for plants you want to compost to increase yield anyway. It's almost a crime to not compost your herb patches, and composting allotments/limpwurts is also a good idea. But the farming guild is full of patches that don't benefit from compost aside from reducing the disease chance, like bush and tree patches.",
