I thought sailing would be the hardest to implement and so I wanted to see the devs team have an easy win for the first new skill.\n\nThe benefit of sailing though is the attention it's getting. We'd be talking less about it if either other skill was chosen.\n\nIn short, while it was not my preferred choice, I'm excited to see it in action.",

Skilling Familiars!\n\nPlayers want more ways to obtain Herblore secondaries? Foraging familiars!\n\nPlayers want certain items to retain value even as the game ages and the market becomes saturated? Use those items to create pouches!\n\nPlayers need a stable currency that\u2019s worth more than gp to get around the max cash stack limit? Add crystals with a fixed sell value!\n\nI don\u2019t think they were expecting to add many more skills to the game once they got to Summoning, because realistically Summoning could\u2019ve been split into 4 different skills with all the value it provided.",

This point is so tired because it implies that Jagex not only had the foresight of the \"New Skill\" poll passing, but also Sailing would get a majority of the \"Which skill would you like\" poll, before passing the final \"Do you want Sailing?\" poll. It's ridiculous to suggest they lowered the % just so Sailing could pass.\n\n>Also, hiding a NEW SKILL in a mega poll at question #6 is fucking crazy.\n\nThis is another point repeated over and over again because it sounds odd unless you were actually there around the time of the poll/announcement. \"Vote for Sailing!\" was fucking ***everywhere***. Twitter, Reddit, Discord, YouTube + content creators, and the main website ALL had posts/videos about voting in the Giga-poll. There was no hiding, it wasn't a secret. Everyone who looked at the poll or payed attention to the Summit knew it was there. Everything passed the Giga-poll by 90% except Sailing. It was so blatantly and intentionally signaled in every possible way they could have that Sailing was a part of the Giga-poll. \n\nThe reason they put it in the Giga-poll in the first place was because they wanted the most amount of people to see it, because it was a Summit, one of--if not *the* most popular Dev showcases for the game.",

It's a collection of islands for you to explore - you even find maps that take you to uniquely generated islands that no one else can find. It has it's own skilling methods, it's own currencies, mini quests, and so on. At the time it was some of the best high level skilling content in the game. \n\nWhat I now need you (or Jagex) to do, is tell me why sailing is necessary for OSRS to add the same thing? \n\nWe can have all the islands and map expansion and new skilling without sailing. What does the actual act of *sailing itself* add to this concept? Why is moving around in a boat fun, and not a chore like walking? Because ultimately, sailing *isnt* finding new islands, it's sailing a boat, and one does not necessarily require the other.",

Do you take the results of the second poll or do you just poll over and over until one side breaks from voter fatigue? They considered a run-off, but in the end chose to refine the option that won both \"Which would you like to see go into refinement\" and \"Which is your favourite?\" polls.\n\nEdit: Sorry for the duplicate comments.

And if we look at existing skills most of them have clear improvements to your characters abilities.\n\nCombat skills are the obvious ones, they make you better at combat.\nAgility makes you better at recovering energy.   \nSmithing makes you better at creating better armor to help your defense (altough it should be reworked because the rewards are now useless after years of updates)   \nHerblore makes you better at creating potions that are useful in many different ways.   \nCooking lets you get food for recovery and support\nCrafting lets you create certain gear, but same problem with smithing, needs an update.   \nFletching gives you access to stronger ammo types   \nRunecrafting gives you better runes    \nConstruction giver you access to more conveniences in your POH.    \n\nThe other skills either gives you necessary materials for the main ones (mining, fishing, woodcuting, farming) or are also weird in what exactly they are rewarding you.    \n\nAnd I think that sailing will fall in this weird category, because right now it is not clear why we will be leveling it. What you mention of new areas, new skilling content, new bossing is just stuff that could be added without a new skill.

They felt like a tacked on means to an end, rather than something that feels fitting for the game world.\n\nSailing for me, already exists in the game thematically, but its a profession and an activity that players cant meaningfully interact with (besides a few small sections of quests, really). \n\n> And if the integration is using a boat to train other skills, then the rewards are not sailing rewards, they are rewards of the other skills\n\nAnd here's the dead giveaway that you just haven't bothered paying attention to any of the information Jagex are providing. Try giving that a shot first before yapping.",

This was something we considered when it became clear that the two pitches were neck-and-neck, but ultimately we decided that this approach had too much potential to hinder the process. We\u2019d probably be left with the same situation, where the results were very close. Plus, we don\u2019t like the idea of pitting two amazing skills against each other! While we love seeing your passionate arguments for the new skills, we want the community to really come together during the refinement phase.\n\nWhich basically contradicts this from the original blog\n\n>Additional polls may be necessary to decide which skill should move forward to refinement.

You've got skills for combat, skills for healing (fishing/woodcutting/firemaking), skills for creating weapons/armor/runes, and so on.  That all made sense, particularly when Runescape was primarily about combat.\n\nBut once you get past that point, it gets a lot harder to justify skill additions.  Why did we need Agility? Why did we need Hunter? Why did we need Thieving? Skills started being added for their own sake (that is, you train Slayer so you can do more Slayer) instead of because they supported other gameplay (you train Cooking so you can make better food that lets you last longer in combat).\n\nThat's why many people, myself included, are opposed to Sailing.  It doesn't add anything to the game except itself (no, new islands/ocean doesn't count, since that always could have been added without a new skill), and it does so at the cost of MASSIVE amounts of development time.\n\nIf you want to add new content to OSRS, absolutely, I'm all for it.  But don't put an XP counter on it just for the sake of saying you have a new skill.",

While the earlier skills may have had a greater focus around combat, later skills have also ensured that the skills are immersive with the entire world of Gilenor. \n\nWhy did we need Agility? Well, gear has weight variation and effects run energy depletion, so the a progression in a skill counteracts that and compliments combat and the back-and-forth loop for skills such as smithing, mining and woodcutting. \n\nWhy did we need Hunter? Well, there's all this content being added filled with NPCs, why not have some form interaction with them and make use of their drops for combat. Giving greater options for resource gathering and use of woodcutting, firemaking, agility etc. \n\nImagine if we were to poll any skill in isolation and try to sell it. Would Construction pass? 'It allows you to teleport from your PoH' 'we already have a spellbook so I can tele from the bank'. \n\nSo far, it seems a lot of oppositon are viewing Sailing as a one-dimension skill rather than viewing *how* the skill can be utilised to greater expand the game and the players interaction with the game. I quite liked [this](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Game_Jam_VI#Player_Owned_Lodge_and_Fragrant_Harvest_Minigame) game jam idea for example. \n\nAs to the development time argument, we have had 5+ quests in the past year, Leagues, Deadman All Stars, Deadman Mode, Valamore with all its content (Collo, new bosses, minigames, new agility courses etc), Titans, Tormented Demons.

There\u2019s also water/ocean EVERYWHERE. It seems like it can very easily be integrated into the existing world with existing skills and environments. And since water was previously untraversable, it can be done in a way where most of it doesn\u2019t interfere with content that people already love (like when summoning came out, and you had people bringing summons everywhere for everything).\n\nIt seems the most integrated while being the least disruptive towards the people who hate it, literally existing between content instead of on top of it.

The skill itself isn't, but the skill *has* things that are like minigames.\n\nIn reality, the main difference between a skill or a minigame is the way the content is gated. Minigames have a much smaller, contained grind. You get uniques specifically from that content (generally speaking). They typically have a bespoke currency. Skills, otherwise, are more broad in the world and not generally contained to one locale, and the content gating is *much* broader, being over 99 levels instead of a few dozen hours at one place. Dungeoneering is really the main one that really did feel like a minigame since it had a unique currency, it was specific to one location, it was a culmination of other skills and never really felt like you were training *it*. Now I actually like Dungeoneering, but I could see why people felt like it was a minigame. Sailing on the other hand is all over the world, the same way mining or fishing or woodcutting or combat is, with various training methods that are intensive or more AFK.

Runecrafting is a skill, but people literally call the gallows the runecrafting guild until GotR. OSRS players just don't like skills. They like minigames. And players don't even like *walking*, they use teletabs and tele rings and beg for one more tele to be added to the POH.\n\nSo make a sailing minigame! Give us an expansion with cool islands and a sailing theme. Skip the years of dev work for a sailing transportation system and just give us teleports to all the islands of interest after we've minigamed to them once. I'm sure as hell not quitting over sailing being added to the game, but I'm telling you we are going to look back at sailing as the biggest waste of years of dev effort.",

Sailing 100% fits with the other skills in the game (you can train sailing anywhere there's a body of water and a boat).",

What about it don\u2019t you like? What are your concerns, legitimate or otherwise? The more we discuss it the better it can be for everyone.\n\nI can at least appreciate that the devs aren\u2019t outright ignoring or dismissing negative feedback.

The magic of waking up to find that there's a *brand new skills* simply can't be recaptured.\n\nI still voted for sailing because I think it has the potential to be fine, and they were obviously dead set on introducing a new skill. People have mentioned their lowering the pass percentage and burying the question in an unrelated poll, but what has always bothered me (and which I spoke out against before they actually did it) was the approach of first asking \"do you want a new skill?\" and then asking \"which new skill do you want?\" It's just another way of circumventing the polling system. I don't think anyone is opposed to the mere idea of having a new skill; it's just that people thought none of the existing proposals were good. Polling the general question in advance just gives Jagex and the community a sense that it's locked in, no matter how much they and we point out that nothing is binding until the final poll.\n\nAgain, a new skill might turn out fine, but even if it does, I think the dev time is probably better spent on other updates.",

I picture stuff like \"agility\" shortcuts, better ores in the rocks, less players around\n\nTo me the scope of Shamanism is what lends itself better as a skill. Sailing is requiring, by their own admission, a massive rethinking of huge swathes of Gielinor. So much shit is going to have to be moved around to support this feature, bodies of water will probably need to be rescaled... I think it's integration with other skills is pretty clear, but the skill itself doesn't really seem to stand on it's own...\n\nShamanism OTOH, already has roots (pardon the pun) with druids to work with, and can very easily integrate into all combat skills (including prayer), woodcutting, etc. AND still be its own thing. It's also not heavily relegated to certain portions of the world, nor does it need to worry about scale, so there aren't really any problems there.\n\nAnd plus, we already have Karamja, which is pretty empty but brimming with nature, shamanism seems like a perfect fit for the people of Tai Bwo Wannai and Shilo Village. How exactly is it \"flat-out not a fantasy RPG skill\"? \n\nIdk, we could speculate all day how they could do it right and how they could fuck it up, just seems weird to me to just assume that it would be the worst implementation possible and couldn't possibly fit in the game.",

Throw screen caps all day, Sailing made it in because the Execa wanted a new skill and the Devs wanted Sailing specifically. Their actions showed that the decision was ultimately not in the hands of the players, we\u2019re just returning the appropriate amount of scruff for it. The game will be fine overall and will take a lot longer to go into real decline.\n\nWe will get a really cool Raids 4 entrance by sea out of it, silver lining really.",

Do we just repoll it a 4th time, and a 5th, and a 10th, until we get a poll where Sailing doesn't get 70% (due to voting fatigue)? Is that how the polling system works, in some people's minds?\n\nedit: saw a lot of people in the twitch chat saying 'riot in Falador 302, make your voices heard that we do not want this shit!' and the like. I know I'm a little late, but surely if this is the 'death of OSRS' and 'EOC 2' the protests would last long enough that I could turn up abour 4 hours later and still see at least ONE cannon placed down? Not a soul in Falador or Varrock, is there some new place to riot that I didn't get the memo on?",

Also the votes were 2 years ago, people change their minds, especially given that the pitches were somewhat bare for how complicated the skill concepts were. \n\nFWIW I haven't really seen much complaint about the skill anywhere particularly public, and most of the criticism I do see seems pretty well reasoned and only really comes up when people complain about other people complaining too much.

From what we\u2019ve seen from sailing so far is you can sail and you can build ships and there are places you can eventually sail to but with how travel methods currently work in the game either content made after the creation of sailing will not have the convenience of todays methods with ease of access from a house as you will need to sail there or sailing will simply just become a construction part 2 where the only thing it is there for is to be a level barrier to content which I don\u2019t think players want in a new skill.
