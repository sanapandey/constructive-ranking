I was a forum moderator and doing any type of moderating at that time was not possible. Threads were pouring in at too rapid of a pace. The only updates that were even close to as bad were Squeel of Fortune and Free Trade removal. \n\nUntil an update is so bad that the 07scape reddit is an unusable mess that the mods cannot keep up with Sailing will just be another update that a vocal minority dislike.

Was not the case in eoc.\n\nYou have abilities being cast for you smartly so you don't have to worry about them when doing slayer or w/e and for bosses I at least gravitated to wanting to the big ones manually. Rs3 is not a bad game, even mtx you can just ignore on IM and 99.9999999...% of the players aren't competing on leaderboards so it won't affect them besides the odd mental block I could never understand",

New pvm encounters, and more.

Compare the 3 final bosses in the raids, they have almost nothing in common other than obviously \"they include movement and protection prayers\" which is not comparable to a mining reskin.\n\nAnd your strawman argument is wrong as well. I do not think sailing breaks integrity. I just don't think the OSRS engine can make what sailing could be in theory, as shown in the previously mentioned Sea of Thieves. I don't think it will be bad, as I said I think it will be ok at best, probably underwhelming.\n\nAgain, strawman argument. I didn't say that it monopolized dev hours. They have multiple teams and one of them is on sailing, you count how many hours that would be for a small team since the first poll passed. Not even including things like QA, Testing and Engine work. They have some amount of devs working on this and I think it would be better spent on another skill.",
