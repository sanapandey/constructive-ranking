How did this come about and what are the rules behind it, like what if I get a high value item that I want to keep to use, do I just have to pay everyone else a fee or something, what if I don't have that kind of money am I just forced to sell it otherwise I'll be labeled a scammer? If that's the case what's even the point of everyone getting their own loot if you just have to share with everyone else",

If you don't have that on hand, you would sell it so you can pay the split. You wouldn't have the item, but you would have a portion of the split, and you can buy the item after several splits.\n\n> If that's the case what's even the point of everyone getting their own loot if you just have to share with everyone else\n\nNot everyone splits. FFA is the other common method, where everyone keeps what they get, but you don't get anything when someone else gets a good drop. There are also other gamemodes, like ironmen - who can't trade with other players, and therefore only can get the item if it actually drops in their name. Note that they can use a second unrestricted account to \"split\" for any drops in their name.\n\nAlso note that most new accounts won't be raiding for quite some time. The leveling *is* the game, unlike other MMOs where you speed through leveling because max level is the game. So probably not something you'll need to worry about for quite some time.",

                    "body": "There's two approaches, splitting and FFA (free for all). With FFA, everybody keeps whatever drops they get. If someone gets a great drop and you don't, too bad, but also if you get something good, you can keep it. So you _can_ sometimes find groups that will do drops this way.\n\nSplitting works the way you describe. If someone gets a unique (potentially over a certain value, depending on the group), then yes, they are expected to sell it and split the money evenly between the group.\n\nThis might seem like a bad deal if _you_ get a good drop, but consider the reverse: if you're raiding with someone else who gets a unique, _you get a lot of money_ even though your own drop wasn't worth much. And money can be exchanged for goods and services. That is, save up the money from a few splits and you can just buy that thing you wanted outright. You can earn enough money from splits to buy it without ever actually getting the drop yourself, even.\n\nSplitting basically just evens out the RNG. If anybody in the group gets lucky, the whole group gets paid. So it doesn't matter so much if you go dry, as long as someone else in the group doesn't.",

                    "body": "For the *most part* you can tick eat standard mage and range attacks at any point after the animation starts.\n\nThe idea of tick eating is this:\n\n* Monster begins attack\n* Monster checks your current HP, and decides it's max hit based on that.\n* Monster rolls damage (0-Your current HP)\n* During this animation you eat a shark. Your current HP is now Current + 20.\n* The monster ends up max hitting you, which reduces your HP by what was your previous current HP. Leaving you on 20 HP.\n\nThis is why you can't tick eat melee attacks, as the animation is instant, and damage is calculated in the same tick it's applied to you (so you have to do incredibly more complex stalls to regen-tick eat and such, which isn't important here).\n\nNot all monsters and not all attacks can be tick ate. Some monsters have projectile based damage, so the tick eating window is either non existent or much smaller. For example you can tick eat the Soteseg big ball attack at the very last game tick before it registers. Any earlier and it's still able to 1 hit you.\n\nI don't know personally if you can tick eat the Warden P1 balls. I assume they could possibly work the same as Sote though.\n\nSome things like Zuk attacks and PvP damage can \"overhit\" where they do not care about your current max HP (and in the case of Zuk, jt can hit well over your max HP). This makes tick eating this damage in the traditional way impossible",

So in something like fight caves, damage is rolled for non-Jad, non-melee mobs when they start their animation, so you simply have to eat in the large window between when their animation starts and when the projectile hits you. If damage is calculated at the same time its applied, like on many newer mobs or Sotetseg or something, then you have to eat on the exact tick the damage hits you.\n\nFor Warden p1 balls specifically, you generally do really finnicky stuff with rapid heal or locator orb+redemption since you probably have Dehydration on if you're at an invo level where you'd need to tick eat. [See video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwuzLbKKioM). If you aren't at that high of an invo level you shouldn't really need to tick eat tbh, you're making mistakes elsewhere if you find you do. But you can if you really want, you just eat immediately before the ball damage impacts your hp, same as usual. If I had to describe the exact timing, it's basically when the big ball is like.. mostly \"inside\" your character but the ball itself is still visible. It's just something you have to practice tbh. Just run regular a 10 (turn Ancient Haste on so you don't have to wait forever for the balls) and rush to Warden. You'll get Honey Locust every death to practice with.",
