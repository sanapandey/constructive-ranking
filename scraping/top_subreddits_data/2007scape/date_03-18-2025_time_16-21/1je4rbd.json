    "selftext": "It was refreshing to see jagex revisit and give the delve boss rewards another look, I would be interested in seeing them have another crack at the god alignments, prayer is sadly pretty much dead after lvl 77 and this was a really cool idea. It\u2019s a shame the last suggestion of two versions of redemption was so mid and somehow killed all chances of it. Would be keen to hear any word on this being revisited in general as I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been spoken about since the backlog was addressed in the gielinor Gazette a while ago. ",

            "body": "Remain a huge fan of the concept but self admittedly we've struggled to design ideas that we think genuinely work - with continued room to expand into *several* more alignment sets.\n\nIt's one thing for us to design 2 or 3, but realistically this system benefits by getting to 7 or 8 as in the image.\n\nThe question is how do you get the balance right and create meaningful different use cases for the sets? Does it become tedious as just *another* thing to switch based on your activity?\n\nSkilling prayers are a popular idea but how do we do it so it's not just a case of now bring prayer potions (and potentially max prayer bonus) to every skilling activity with just another thing to manage.\n\nI don't think we're closed off to ever contemplating this again but for the forseeable we aren't revisiting this, though perhaps someone will have an S tier suggestion of genuinely balanced and well thought out ideas. There's lots of awesome ideas amongst the suggestions but in practice we've not made em work.\n\nFor now I think it's more likely we move forward with filling out higher prayer levels with new additions to the current prayer book.",

                    "body": "Maybe it could be a raid mechanic? Godwars styled raid thats kind of akin to how Barbarian Assault is with roles. I think this would be kind of cool considering theres been a fair amount of people asking about defined roles not quite EOC but more so like tank utility, mage, healer and so on. You start the raid and trade in your normal prayer book for a role related prayer book. \n\nX amount of role experience can be used to perma reduce prayer drain of a regular prayer book prayer tied to that god. So say you do an armadyl (ranged) role. You stock up a ton of points in that and buy a reduction (one time use only per associated prayer) for rigour that would cause its drain rate to be reduced by 1/4th or something minor but still meaningful. This would encourage players to try all roles. Make balanced teams dedicated to roles and still be within the realm of not too strong a buff. \n\nCould be other prayer related rewards for the raid too but i think it could be fun to have raid specific mechanics that affect things like spell books/ prayer books. For a while I\u2019ve had an idea of a Necromancer raid that ties into thralls and the Arceuus spell book that would change how some of the spells work and you use the spells to empower and build up a thrall through the raid to help you in the final boss battle.",

It's pretty obvious that it is inevitable that there would be an overlap between those prayers anyway, but given the initial pitch featured 2 redemption clones, I think you are okay with that. But if those similar prayers are separated by sets (instead of cloning a base prayer book one), then even though those would be prayers have the same use case alone, the other prayers in their set weights in as to why you would pick it instead of the other featuring the mirror prayer.\n\nFor group activities, preventing prayers that apply debuff-ish effects to stack with effects from the same alignment would also encourage variety; even if X alignment would the strongest for Y content, members of the group would still see value in getting other alignments.\n\n>Does it become tedious as just\u00a0*another*\u00a0thing to switch based on your activity?\n\nIt's only as tedious as the medium used to make the switch. People already switch constantly their equipment and inventories based on the activities they do, *having* to switch is never the issue; having to travel to specific locations as an extra step *is*.\n\n>Skilling prayers are a popular idea but how do we do it so it's not just a case of now bring prayer potions (and potentially max prayer bonus) to every skilling activity with just another thing to manage.\n\nI mean, it's as simple as giving ways for prayer to regen *while* skilling, either bound to the alignment prayers or from new skilling equipment/effects. For example, an agility prayer that registers how many laps you have completed while its on, and gives an xp drop proportional to that number once it turns off while giving back the prayer it drained. Encourages doing as much laps as possible at once (discouraging not paying too much attention and losing laps) and makes the payoff scale with your prayer level too.\n\nI don't think giving value to prayer bonus for skilling is an issue either. If anything, it gives way to a new reward space for skilling outfits/gear that isn't just bigger xp boosts.",

This also rewards having higher prayer - maybe something only requires 35 prayer (and drains 7 prayer per tick for 5 ticks of drain needed). You drain 70 \u2192 35 for the first buff, then again 35 \u2192 0 for another X minutes. These timers would *not* stack so you don't just drink a bunch of prayer pots at the start to get hours long buffs.\n\nAlso having to drain X points uninterrupted in order to activate the buff helps prevent people from feeling like they \"have\" to prayer flick to be more efficient.",

So, theoretically you could use Armadyl with a Noxious Halberd and have 3 tile range and big damage from that, or you could use Bandos with a Longbow on Longrange style",

For example, I listed those examples because I'm quite a fan of the idea of Longbows actually being good at something via the Bandos prayers. Maybe they make Dark Bow actually good as a main weapon. \n\nAnd you say 'everything complicated has not made it to the game' but what is 'complicated' also is subjective. For example, having to go on the wiki to find out the maxhit formula for a given powered staff, then find out how much that max hit is amped by via your gear, and then work out 'how much more % do I need to hit the next max hit threshold', that could be considered 'complicated'. Or 'all of the goofy Wilderness-only rules/systems'. \n\n'Complicated' only really applied to Jagex's pitched Seren prayers, with the whole 'if you attack at the same tick as an ally both of you get a damage buff', and even then that was because they explained it really badly. Prayer descriptions are simple and to the point, and there's nothing stopping Armadyl's prayer from saying 'you have 1+ attack range', '+X% accuracy and damage per tile distance from target', and for Bandos, 'zug zug slow weapon hit harder', 'hit slower but hit harder' and 'raaargh walk on puny enemy tile, do damage'. The specific details can be left to the wiki pages, just like how Redemption doesn't tell you how much it heals for at each Prayer level, it just says 'Heals you when damaged and health falls below 10%'",

Change the former, then the latter becomes an obvious thing to change too.\n\n>Role Prayers devolve into \"everyone go DPS.\"\n\nDiscourage using the same prayers, simple as. If everyone going for the best DPS alignment means hard enough diminishing returns instead of varying alignments for stronger overall effects, then everyone will enforce alignment variety in groups.\n\n>Tier 80 prayers just don't have the design space to carry 7-8 sets of alignments\n\nThat lack of design space is caused *exactly* by brushing off skilling prayers and role prayers, this is *once again* a self-inflicted limitation rather than an actual issue. Of course there's not much creativity to be had with prayers if they are **absolutely forced** to make so that said prayers can **ONLY** be generic combat numerical increases.\n\n>God Alignments unfortunately are the ultimate \"sounds good, doesn't work,\"\n\nIt \"doesn't work\" because every attempt to even theorize something good is instantly shut down by irrelevant limitations.
