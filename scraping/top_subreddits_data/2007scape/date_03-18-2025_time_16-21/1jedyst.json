With no items equipped and 0 defense (zamorak brews), a variety of snails in the multi combat zones near the nature grotto and the southern haunted woods were unable to deal even a single hit of damage to me. I remember I used to kill these snails for money, and they had no problem dealing chip damage while I had base 60 stats + a little bit of armor.\n\nDoes anyone know why this would be?  \nedit: ~~can anyone confirm this that hasn't done making friends with my arm quest?~~ confirmed that snails appear to be unable to deal damage even if you don't have the fire of dehumidification built.

I do not have the bonfire from the My Arm quests.  I stood afk at this lvl 20 purple snail for five minutes and never took any damage.\n\nSo it seems like snails are not doing damage anymore.",
