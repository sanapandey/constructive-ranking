Black Sabbath is a bigger name but their actual touring was few and far between while Maiden never seems to go off the road.",

Maiden beats them in almost every aspect I can think of, album sales, top 10 hits, highest charting hits, number of albums, touring success, radio airplay, just everything, and it's not even close.\n\nReally when it comes to classic rock, I can only see like Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Beetles, The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Journey, ACDC and maybe like 3 or 4 others AT BEST that deserves to go in before Iron Maiden and a few of them are debatable on if they should actually go in before them (last two i mentioned), but no more than that as they have been just as long as most of them, and have kept a steady following all along and are still charting today.\n\nThe hall is not worth the name, if it's this stupid.",

And Metallica's music peaked in the 80s and the band's music hasn't been at the same level of heavy since the Black album (some will argue even before that). Priest is still making amazing music. Maiden is still making amazing music. Hell, *Megadeth*, despite Dave's voice getting worse with age, is still putting out fantastic heavy metal music. Dystopia & TSTDATD are up there with their classics as some of their best.",

I tried it becasue it had Maiden branding on but I drink it because it's nice. It's clearly been judged to be good before they branded it. \n\nI've seen Maiden 4 times over 18 years, not once have they felt like they were phoning it in, other bands do this but i have seen polaenty of bands, such as Marilyn Manson, putting in little to no effort, stumbling over their lyrics and generally not being 100%.\n\nIf Iron Maiden get inducted i won't be sad however the fact they aren't in it is a better sign for the band than being in it. They don't need the R&R Hall of Fame, they are more about the music than such \"honours\" .\n\nDoes that make sense? probably not but that's what you're getting.",
