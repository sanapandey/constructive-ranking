He made that album himself, and it turned him into a star. You act like some people high up in the music business just chose him or something and it came out of nowhere. \n\nBill Withers came out of nowhere and became a star. Maybe Christ Stapleton is a plant because he wasn\u2019t a mainstream artist until his late 30s. Going  back further, Willie Nelson put out a bunch of underwhelming pop songs and wasn\u2019t until he was 40 that he became a huge country star.\n\nJelly Roll is literally no different from anyone I mentioned in terms of how they got famous.",

And I was at work earlier and couldn't remember the name of the first album. It was \"Dark Days, Bright Nights\". The earlier version is not as well produced, as it was with a lower budget. But it's still awesome. The 2nd version of it, uses a lot of the same songs, but changes the order around and has new songs as well. The original has a song called \"Kuntry Folks\". Which follows the beat/progression of \"Country Boy Can Survive\". And it didn't have \"Ugly\", which I think was a big hit. I can't remember. According to Wikipedia, the Interscope version came out in 2001. No clue when the Newtown version came out.\n\nEdit: 2000 https://www.discogs.com/release/493188-Bubba-Sparxxx-Dark-Days-Bright-Nights",

            "body": "Jason DeFord has a curious career trajectory. After grinding away in the Rap circuit for decades, Jelly Roll didn\u2019t manage to get anywhere. Once Kid Rock had pretty much cornered the market on Hick-Hop & hip hopper Nelly collaborated with country musician Tim McGraw, The Industry decided it was time for a new (sub)genre. By the time the likes of Post Malone & Elle King were all the rage, making the popularization of tattoos mainstream, Rock, Folk, & Country were nearly indistinguishable. Nathaniel Rateliff & Chris Stapleton took over Pop; Zach Williams dominated the Gospel charts, following a Johnny Cash-esque prison concert.\u00a0\n\n\nThe story goes, Jelly Roll got his nickname from his mother because he liked to eat donuts after church. But this seems unlikely as most regions don't call a pastry a \"roll\" unless it's a dinner roll. (Incidentally, a jelly roll pan is a long, wide flat baking sheet with sides. It\u2019s used for baking a shallow sponge cake. Jelly or custard is spread onto it, which holds the cake together as it\u2019s rolled into a tight swirl. Nothing close to a hand-held pastry.) The Midwest-- especially MN, WI, IA-- take flack for referring to multiple pastries as donuts (e.g. eclairs) but the only one to occasionally get called a roll is a Bismarck, which MO considers a \u201cjelly donut.\u201d The term certainly isn't common in Jelly Roll's birth state of TN.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's worth noting Jelly Roll Morton was a popular turn-of-the-century Creole musician who essentially invented Jazz. Ferdinand LaMothe started out playing piano in a brothel, much to the dismay of his church-going grandmother, so he adopted African-American slang for female genitalia to avoid disgracing his family name. \"Jelly Roll\u201d Morton posthumously received 2 Grammys + a Tony + was inducted into both the Rock & Roll & Louisiana Music Halls of Fame, earned for his innovation as a musician, composer, & arranger who influenced Jazz, Ragtime, Blues, & Dixieland. BTW, a popular band in DE is suing singer Jelly Roll over use of the name.\u00a0\n\n\nEarly footage of the seeming country boy Jelly Roll shows he was a \u201cWigger,\u201d wearing a durag while hanging out with pals at an vacant basketball court in an urban neighborhood. Since Jelly doesn\u2019t play any instruments, singing was his only option when it became clear he wasn\u2019t going to make it big as a rapper. Nearly every appearance\u2013 from social media posts to award acceptance speeches\u2013 he sheds tears, \u201cI just can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here! I can\u2019t believe this is happening!\u201d Why?? Fame was his sole ambition. Jelly may not be an industry plant in the literal sense but he was certainly catapulted to stardom by switching genres, i.e. right place right time.\u00a0\n\n\nHis fame was largely aided by his wife Alyssa, a former sex worker. \u201cBunny XO\u201d saw Jelly perform in Vegas; post-divorce, she pursued him & offered a place to stay. Any service industry requires charisma, or at least a knack for schmoozing, but the sex industry in particular breeds/ fosters then hones certain manipulative skills. Bunny set her sights on an overweight, broke, homeless addict with mediocre talent then gave him a home, notoriety by proxy, & helped him get full custody of his kids. Now she has a podcast, which manages to get popular musicians as guests. She & Jelly\u2019s relationship is its own schtick: a gender-reverse Cinderella story that incorporates effective tropes, e.g. redemption arc, unfairly judged underdogs.\n\n\nAs Stand-up Comedy eclipsed traditional celebrity, YouTube channels replaced talk shows. Suddenly, movie stars & musicians were clamoring to ingratiate themselves on podcasts. Years prior, actor & shock comedian Tom Green broadcast interviews from his house, which he streamed via the burgeoning World Wide Web. Soon, comic Brian Reban convinced actor/ reality TV contest host Joe Rogan to start his own podcast. Simultaneously, Joe (then an aspiring comic), gradually took over The Comedy Store as the illness of its owner Mitzi Shore (actor Pauley Shore\u2019s mother) progressed. Through a series of strategic maneuvers, Rogan rose to prominence as \u201cThe Godfather\u201d of Comedy; his \u201cDeath Squad\u201d became the gatekeepers. Joey \u201cCoco\u201d Diaz still brags about demanding sexual favors for open mic slots, relishing a letter sent to him by Chelsea Handler upon the success of her talk show.\n\n\nHis merry band of degenerates included Tony Hinchcliffe, who worked at The Store while writing jokes for \u201cRoastmaster\u201d Jeff Ross. Brian Redban produced Hinchcliffe\u2019s \u201cKill Tony\u201d podcast after getting fired by Rogan. Host Tony aimes to train & give exposure to aspiring comics by providing a platform. They have 1 minute to perform a set. Afterwards, Tony conducts a Howard Stern-inspired interview, \u201croasting\u201d them by mocking low-hanging fruit with puns & alliterated superlatives. Unfortunately, Hinchcliffe has neither comedic instinct (other than playground-style insults) nor business acumen but consistency coupled with pandering to The Godfather paid off: Joe bought Tony a house & eventually his club The Mothership hosted Kill Tony. Hollow free speech rhetoric set up their Conservative political schtick as an unprecedented decline in TV networks\u2019, movie studios\u2019 & streaming platforms\u2019 ratings made their respective YouTube projects look like gold. Consequently, Joe\u2019s deal with Spotify inspired Tony to make one with Netflix.\n\n\nTrue to form, Jelly Roll glazed retired fighter-turned failed comic Brendan Shaub on the podcast he cohosted with a comic/ actor. Jelly waxed poetic about the creative process he watched unfold even tho Schaub is most famous for what was (arguably) the lowest-rated standup comedy special. Ever. Jelly made the rounds on Rogansphere podcasts, including episodes of Kill Tony, even performing at Hinchcliffe & friends\u2019 arena show. The circlejerk of glazing led to hiring his comedian pals for a private birthday party, which included a roast. The few published pix show more forced exaggerated laughter from Jelly than from Tony Hinchcliffe, who\u2019s known for his effusive hyperbolic praise of aspiring comics he thinks he\u2019s mentoring to stardom (not including those already well-known for whom he\u2019s tried to claim credit).\n\n\nKid Rock got his nickname from rap battles. Bob Ritchie\u2019s family may have been well-off (his father owned multiple car dealerships) but neither money nor clout will make you a wordsmith. Determined to make it despite being a scrawny White boy, everyone was shocked by his talent, saying, \"This kid rocks!\" Kid Rock is a self-taught musician, capable of grabbing a random guitar & improving by composing lyrics on the fly while playing by ear. He claims he can play every instrument in his band, which has allowed him to oversee the production on most of his albums. Regardless, Kid Rock actually advised up-&-comer Marshall Matthews to enunciate. Eminem was undoubtedly skilled lyrics-wise but he needed to stop mumbling, otherwise no one would be able to understand his intricate & clever rhyme schemes. Similarly, Eminem had to prove himself by participating in rap battles. Unlike Kid Rock, he grew up poor & saw fame as a way out of poverty. However, they both made their way based on merit, not needing a gimmick.",

Jelly roll isn't making that kind of music either.

And that's to some extent every Jelly Roll song I've heard that he wasn't \"rapping\" in. Jelly Roll just leans more towards the power ballad side of shitty Southern rock (which is also fairly common in bro-country) but its the same formula nonetheless. I will admit Jelly Roll often comes across with more of a Christian Rock vibe than the just straight  southern rock hooks in most bro-country, but that certainly isn't an improvement in my estimation.\n\nI live in a town of musicians, nearly everyone here is in the industry. I don't know any actual musicians who feel the same way about Sturgill and Jelly. While I do appreciate his success,  I just think the music is pandering and unoriginal (but admittedly I feel that way about most popular music).",

The biggest difference to me is it doesn\u2019t seem like Jelly Roll is trend hopping like Kid Rock has done. Kid Rock left rap to chase nu metal because it was popular and would get him more money and once that died out he tried chasing country because he thought it would make him more money. Kid Rock also seems to be a talentless hack that relies on the music of others to make his stuff listenable, I mean one of his biggest songs is just his shitty lyrics over Sad But True\u2019s music. He did the same thing with Alice In Chains and Warren Zevon. Jelly Roll may not be the most talented artist, but at least his music comes from an honest place even if it is the same thing over and over again.",
