The quote is there directly in the article.\n\n>\u201cWe broke up with him first. We quit Twitter in 2022 when he was only half a Nazi. Then someone else took our handle, pretending to be our official account, **so we filed a legal complaint to put a stop to that \u2014 which is why @dropkickmurphys shows as suspended**. Look, we pulled our account because we didn\u2019t want to be part of that guy\u2019s empire. But if we were still on there, I\u2019m sure he would have suspended us by now.\u201d\n\nNo matter how shitty of a person Elon Musk is, there are far too many people in this thread spreading misinformation - and making excuses for spreading misinformation even after they get corrected.  Musk didn't wrong these people by banning the account, if anything Twitter fully complied with their legal request.  This is just more zealotry in order to stir the pot, instead of just reading the damn article.",

Really it's the general idea behind my first comment in this thread, I was just kind of making a general comment about how Reddit blindly hates certain people. If I would have cared more about this then I would have dug in and read into it properly. And I don't mean to say that to dismiss what you're saying cuz again, you're completely right, I just mean that I was just kind of making an offhand comment.",

They deactivated their account in 2022 and left Twitter.  They filed a legal complaint to get this account pretending to be them banned.

Lots of anti-vaxx stuff and far right pundits like Candace Owens, Madison Cawthorn, OAN, Newsmax etc. \n\nHe\u2019s never publicly stated any support for these people or their ideology but given how many of these accounts he was following, people have drawn their own conclusions that he\u2019s likely at least sympathetic to them. \n\nPersonally I\u2019m not entirely sure. He said he supported Bernie in 2016 so that\u2019s something. I was halfway joking about him not coming back tbh haha.",
