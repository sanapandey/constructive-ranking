There were two countries mentioned in her story, the US and the UK.\n\nAnd I didn't know the US wasn't a democracy \u2013 sure, it doesn't do all that well in comparisons but it's citizens usually brag about how free they are, and surely among those freedoms must be the freedom to choose their government. And if it's not a democracy, why does the vice president come to Europe to teach about democracy (which apparently consists of appeasing right wing lunatics)?",

Look at Sweden and Finland, which are two countries as alike as any. It would remove the last vestiges of an unequal society, but also add a bit of political tinge and division to the head of state who should represent the whole of the country.",

How functional they are also varies. Some seem to work better than others.\n\nI absolutely argue that perfect representation doesn\u2019t exist.

Do you like D\u2019Hondts mandate assignment method? What about referendums?
