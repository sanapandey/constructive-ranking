Rest in peace, soulful man.\n\nWell, I live on a ridgetop  \nAnd, Lord knows, I like it just fine  \nWhere it's windy and foggy  \nAnd quiet most all the time  \nYeah, my lawn is pine needles  \nAnd my driveway is old funky dirt  \nAnd my front pathway markers  \nAre pieces of granite and chert  \nNow, my taxes are high  \nBut I don't believe it's a sin  \nI've got hundred foot pine trees  \nThat just love to dance in the wind  \nAnd a yard full of bushes  \nThat turn into pie in July  \nBetween blue jays and hoot owls  \nI've got twenty-four hour singing sky  \nNow, when I built my house  \nI cut six trees to clear out the land  \nBut there's thirty or more left  \nAnd you know that they're gonna stand  \nIt's a squirrel sanctuary  \nThey think this woods is their home  \nAnd as long as I'm here  \nI'll make sure people leave us all alone  \nYes, the hill that I live on is steep  \nAnd the road's full of ruts  \nAnd the people who live in the flatlands  \nThink we folks are nuts  \nBut the ruts in my road and the curves  \nKeep the tourists at bay  \nAnd it's lonesome and peaceful  \nAnd you know I like it that way  \nNow, I work in the city  \nI think my job is a gas  \nAnd I know it's good for me  \nTo travel and get off my ass  \nBut the very best part of each trip  \nIs the Golden Gate Bridge  \nAnd the road like a snake  \nThat will lead me back home to my ridge  \nAh, ridgetop",
