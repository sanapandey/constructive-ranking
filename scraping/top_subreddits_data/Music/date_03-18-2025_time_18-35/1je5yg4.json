    "selftext": "We finally hit 1,000 after a few years of working at it! 1,000 is a small number in the music world but it was not easy at all to get to this point. It involved having to write/record new material, being our own booking agent, trying to constantly make connections, actively learning different production techniques, getting marketing material together, managing social medias, band practices, driving hours to play several out of town shows in a cramped car, designing merch, video/photo shoots, taking notes from other bands on how to put on a better show for the crowd, dealing with negative comments/self doubt, and having full time jobs to support ourselves. Like I said, 1000 monthly listeners isn\u2019t much but I still wanted to share this so people know that putting in the work can lead to positive outcomes. https://open.spotify.com/album/6cunixf1pQlurarixfCY2G?si=9SGBmUylSda2EML_MQfGRw\n\n",
