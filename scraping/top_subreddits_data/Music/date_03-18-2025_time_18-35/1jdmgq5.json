The whole episode is a goodie.\n\n\nPAUL RUDD: I\u2019m just having this memory right now, as we\u2019re talking.\n\n \n\nSETH: Yeah.\n\n \n\nPAUL RUDD: When I was in college, there was a band. I was obsessed with this band. I loved them so much: Trip Shakespeare, and they were huge at the University of Kansas where I was going to school.\n\n \n\nSETH: I\u2019ll play them right now on the podcast so people can hear them.\n\n \n\nPAUL RUDD: You should. They\u2019re awesome.\n\n \n\nTRIP SHAKESPEARE (song plays): Can I tell you a romantic story?\n\n \n\nSETH: This is \u2018The Slacks\u2019 by trip Shakespeare.\n\n \n\nPAUL RUDD: A little side note, half of them kind of went on to form the band Semisonic.\n\n \n\nSETH: Oh yeah! (laughing)\n\n \n\nSETH: Semisonic the amazing band that did \u2018Closing Time.\u2019\n\n \n\nPAUL RUDD: Yeah. So anyway, I used to love. And I\u2019d see them in college. And I had a real hero worship thing with them. I was dressing like them.\n\n \n\nI mean, it was like, I kind of worshiped them (Seth laughing) and then they went on tour. I saw them in California. Then they went to San Francisco and I followed them.\n\n \n\nSETH: (laughing) Like, like a deadhead?\n\n \n\nPAUL RUDD: Totally. One time in San Francisco, I went with some friends. We were all fans. Everyone in my group left. I stayed because I wanted to talk to them after the show.\n\nAnd all my friends had gone. In fact, everyone had gone, the band was still there and they gave me a ride home. (Seth laughing)\n\n \n\nPAUL RUDD: And I remember I\u2019m in this van, in their touring van with the band and there, and they\u2019re saying, so where does your friend Doug live? And they\u2019re looking at maps. This was, there was no\u2026and they drove me home. And I just remember thinking, man, my favorite band in the world is also like the coolest guys, like who would do that?\n\n \n\nSETH: Yeah, that\u2019s amazing.\n\n \n\nPAUL RUDD: I think that there have been moments in my life where people that I really admired were like were nice to me.\n\n \n\nSETH: Yeah.\n\n \n\nPAUL RUDD: I hadn\u2019t thought about that until you told me this story.",

That is incredible!\n\nI've been a fan of Semisonic since Closing Time hit and I was in 7th grade. \n\nIn my naivety I emailed them, and again, this is during the height of Semisonic's fame with the song, telling them how much I loved the album and where it sat in my CD folder of favorite CDs (it was page 2), and they (or their management) emailed me back.\n\nThat was the coolest thing ever for a kid in 7th grade. I'm over 40 now and still love the band and follow even their newest music.\n\nBecause of that I've read Jake's book (drummer of Semisonic) and in the book he mentioned Trip Shakespeare, so I got on eBay and bought all of their tapes and the one album that was available on CD, and then I made mp3s of all of their albums. I even had to go out and buy a walkman, then ran that to my PC and recorded each side, then cut out and named the songs meticulously. It was a whole thing.\n\nAnd I've been a big fan of Paul Rudd for a long time, so this whole thing you posted just made me love him all the more. If I ever meet the dude, we are talking Trip Shakespeare. Haha.",

He won because illegal immigration was utterly out of control. Remember that bill the previous administration claimed they needed to fix the border? Oopsies! Looks like that was a lie. He won because the left can't seem to figure out that people don't want men in women sports. Sorry folks, that's an 80/20 issue, and you guys can't seem to figure out that reality. \n\nYou whine about the voting numbers. What a stupid thing to argue. More votes for him than Harris, so while you claim it's a minority, what does that mean for the left? Well, let's look at current polling! 27% dem approval. Woof... Meanwhile, more people think we are on the right track than we've seen since 2004. \n\nYou guys are in an absolute bubble of fantasy at this point.
