Kendrick replied with subliminals on Like That, then Drake officially began the battle by releasing \"Push Ups\" and that weird AI release\n\nHow could UMG have orchestrated this whole promo deal when Drake began the battle? Then, Not Like Us just blew up. Why wouldn't they promote the biggest song in the world? And Drake can't say UMG made it the biggest through marketing, that's not how music works. The songs have to be good to get that popular. It doesn't matter how much marketing they get",

            "body": ">Universal Music Group has filed a scathing motion to dismiss Drake\u2018s New York lawsuit against them for promoting Kendrick Lamar\u2018s \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d stating that he\u2019s only suing because he \u201clost a rap battle\u201d and took legal action to \u201csalve his wounds.\u201d\n\n\n\n>The motion, filed earlier today and reviewed by Variety, took a cutting approach to making the case for dismissal, claiming that Drake \u201clost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated. Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds. Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint is utterly without merit and should be dismissed with prejudice.\u201d \n\n\n\n>The filing notes that Drake himself signed a public petition less than three years ago criticizing \u201cthe trend of prosecutors using artists\u2019 creative expression against them\u201d by interpreting rap lyrics as fact. \u201cDrake was right then and is wrong now,\u201d reads the motion. \u201cComplaint\u2019s unjustified claims against UMG are no more than Drake\u2019s attempt to save face for his unsuccessful rap battle with Lamar.\u201d \n\n\n\n>In its motion to dismiss, Universal is arguing that Drake fails to make a claim for defamation in his suit, stating that it\u2019s a double standard to expect them to promote his diss tracks against Lamar and not vice versa. The motion adds that \u201cNot Like Us\u201d \u201cconveys nonactionable opinion and rhetorical hyperbole, not fact,\u201d meaning they can\u2019t be accused of acting with malice, and further claims that there\u2019s no basis for the suit since Drake failed to state a claim for \u201charassment in the second degree\u201d and under New York General Business Law.",

It's one of the least effective arguments you can make. The Democrats themselves, including the specific people who lost their jobs in this election, do not endorse it, and neither do most of their voters, myself included. \n\nTrump's popularity is the reason we're in this pickle. He has consistently pulled the same reliable bloc of voters in all three of his elections, and he did it in both red and blue-controlled states, with fairly consistent numbers that match the exit poll trends. \n\nThe votes were absolutely manipulated, but not by hacking voting machines. They were manipulated by fomenting low-information, low-effort outrage and fear on social media through a sophisticated but entirely legal propaganda campaign underwritten by our oligarchical class of tech billionaires.

It means that there are people out there that thought \"hell yeah Drake's a colonizer who is taking the things we had to break our chains of slavery to get for ourselves\" and then vote for someone who thinks black people are so inferior that none of them are capable of holding any sort of job or it's DEI, slavery isn't worth bringing up anymore because we solved racism, and that colonization was a good thing. \n\nThis is without taking Kendrick as an artist outside of Not Like Us, which most people are aware of to some extent. He's [\"black as the heart of a fucking Aryan\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdPtVZDspIY) talking about how white people want to \"terminate [his] culture.\" He's [\"ducking the overnight activists\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6HBZC9pZHQ) during the BLM protests. He [\"wants 40 acres and a mule not 40 ounces and a pitbull.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6HBZC9pZHQ) The slaves \"picked the cotton that made [America] rich, now my dick ain't free.\" \n\nThis is not the rapper for people who think all black pilots are DEI hires, so how can his fans vote for Trump? Only by dismissing the obvious contradiction without solving it.",

Thrown in prison for life right? Wrong! The most minor of slaps on the wrist. Prescott's son would then go on to be promoted to the head of the CIA, eventually getting made to be the guy that runs the country(this sub is fucking stupid) for 1 term, his son then got to serve 2 running the country units(again, dumb fucking sub). And that is just one of the more obvious examples of the bad timeline being omnipresent. It's always been poking it's head through. Some of the biggest rewrites in history is that fascism was just coming for Europe and we helped, it was coming for us too. We just had people willing to do something about it still.",

First album after the beef being a stinker that's barely getting club play is going to make it harder to come back on the next album. If the next album isn't a world beater we're gonna keep seeing these steady decreases in plays on his newly released shit.\n\nEdit: and I think he went about this album totally wrong. Being that it was his first project after the beef, there were going to be a ton of ears on it in the first couple days just to hear what he had to say. One of the biggest criticisms from non-Drake fans and Drake fans that left is that he makes superficial party/mall walkin music, and that's exactly what he did. Again. One of the main reasons artists start off hot and then can't follow it up is because they don't have the same pain or struggle as when they were coming up. Drake had the opportunity to access pain and struggle for this album and come up with some real art, and instead of that, he decided to go with some 7th grader shit called Some Sexy Songs 4 U. I don't think he has the ability to be real anymore. And again, I don't think his career is over, but i think we're well past the peak.",

Nothing personal at all is talked about in this song.\n- Push Ups: Drake makes fun of Kendrick's height, claims Kendrick was being extorted by his last label, and mentions Kendrick's fiance implying she's unfaithful and/or he is abusive towards her.\n- Taylor Made: Drake claims Kendrick is struggling to respond and uses AI of 2pac and Snoop Dogg to continue taunting Kendrick\n- Euphoria: Kendrick disses Drake with a bunch of things people have already said about him (plastic surgery rumors, using ghost writers, being insecure about his blackness, being a bad father, etc.). He also warns Drake not to talk about his family and not take it further.\n- 6:16 in LA: Kendrick says he has a mole in Drake's camp and again warns him not to take it any further.\n- Family Matters: Drake says Kendrick doesn't live with his family anymore and that he and Whitney aren't ever getting married, that he beat his fiance, tells Whitney to shake her ass for Drake, claims Whitney was unfaithful and that one of Kendrick's children is actually the child of Kendrick's best friend and manager Dave Free.\n- Meet The Grahams: Kendrick says Drake has problems with addiction, compares him to Harvey Weinstein, claims Drake is trafficking girls in his house and exposing his son to sex traffickers, and claims Drake has another secret child.\n- Not Like Us: Kendrick doubles down on Drake being a pedophile and associating with pedophiles.\n- The Heart Part 6: Drake says he is actually the one who planted false information for Kendrick to use against him, and says Kendrick is obsessed with pedophiles because he was molested as a child.",

Control set it off (which, to be fair, was more of an \u201cI\u2019m better than everyone\u201d verse than one specifically targeted at Drake). Drake did a really condescending [interview](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Rde74qv-iZ8) afterwards where he said Control was a good attention-getting moment but nothing more. \n\nThen Drake responded subliminally on wax with The Language (\u201cTalk all that shit just to get a reaction\u201d, among other shots). Kendrick responds a little less subliminally with his BET [cypher verse](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=l8wPPmz8Rpc&pp=ygUTYmV0IGN5cGhlciB0b3AgZGF3Zw%3D%3D). Then there\u2019s a kind of stalemate for a couple years, with Kendrick\u2019s feature on All The Stars by SZA serving as another subliminal shot.  \n\nThen Drake and Cole drop First Person Shooter, which Kendrick was asked to be on but refused. Again, more of a \u201cme and Cole are better than everyone\u201d verse than one specifically aimed at Kendrick. Then Kendrick\u2019s Like That verse goes gun blazing and turns a Cold War into a hot one, explicitly referencing Drake\u2019s For All the Dogs album and stating \u201cMotherfuck the big 3, it\u2019s just big me.\u201d\n\nThe first few tracks by Drake and Kendrick (Push-Ups and Euphoria, respectively) kept it pretty standard as far as rap beef goes. Euphoria includes a warning where Kendrick says \u201cwe should keep this a friendly fade\u201d and warns Drake not to involve family members or this shit will turn ugly (\u201cIf you take it there, I\u2019m taking it further, that\u2019s something you don\u2019t wanna do\u201d). \n\nDrake ignores the warnings and drops a song mocking Kendrick\u2019s idol, 2Pac, then Family Matters, where he explicitly calls Kendrick a domestic abuser, says he beat up his girl, and that his kid is illegitimate, fathered by Kendrick\u2019s manager Dave Free. \n\nThat\u2019s the first real instance of all-out mud-slinging. Kendrick responds in kind with Meet the Grahams and Not Like Us, calling him a pedophile, and Drake sues Universal for allowing the release of a song alleging that. That\u2019s what Universal means when they say Drake \u201cprovoked\u201d the rap battle \u2014 not so much that he started it, but that he was the one that turned it from a purely lyrical test of skill to a full-on smear campaign. \n\nNot sure if I got the chronology fully right, I\u2019m doing this all off memory, but that\u2019s basically what happened.",

Sometimes it works, but it's just part of the game. If the judge thinks the case is frivolous and improperly filed or something, they may dismiss, but it doesn't mean they will or that the case can't be refiled. \n\nIt looks like their motion is asking to dismiss on the grounds of being improperly filed/not meeting the burden/requirements for a defamation case. They claim there is no evidence or accusation that could be construed as \"Malice\", one of the requirements for a defamation case to continue and for the plaintiff to win. \n\nSo if the judge dismisses, the question becomes if it is dismissed with prejudice or without, which will determine if they can refile the suit. I'd imagine if they do dismiss, they'll leave it open to be refiled in case Drake somehow finds more evidence to support his claim. \n\nIf the judge doesn't dismiss, it's moving forward as usual. I'm sure the defense will move to dismiss several times on several different grounds if necessary. \n\nStill funny though.",

So, that fact that he dissed Kendrick was surprising, but what broke my respect was when he replied to Kendrick's response. He isn't built like that. It's like squaring up with Man Man because the girls are watching. You know Man Man doesn't have a full set of teeth because he is really about that brawl life. You know this.
