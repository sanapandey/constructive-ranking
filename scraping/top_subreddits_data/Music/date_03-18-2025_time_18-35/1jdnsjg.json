At the time I was squatting,  had a bit of a drug habit. One day I crashed at a friend's who had cable TV with MTV, which was huge at the time. There was this song from fun loving criminals,  Barry white, which I loved, great video too with the bmx riding. Anyways, there was a blink180 song, don't know which, but I immediately categorized it should proper bullshit, plastic punk we called it, turned it off, never heard about it again. \n\nYears later, I became sober, got I kid, got a job, didn't want the kid to live like I did, so.. got a colleague, tattooed top to bottom,  vans shoes, looked like a skate punk or something.. only listened to blink180 and angels and airwaves, Katy Perry and everything in the charts. Held the most conservatives World views, kind of a bigot. Was my second time getting in touch with blink,  so I guess your assessment is very right.",

From 2000 until 2011 I must have seen them 20 times, if not more, from here in Cincinnati to Columbus, Cleveland, Indy, Louisville, Lexington and even once in South Carolina. If they came within two hours of me I made every attempt to go. They were just here in Cincinnati and I didn't even care or bother to go.\n\n\nTheir sound changed to me, Al Barr went on hiatus for what I believe is more than his mom being sick (find him on Instagram, it's saddening) and the new music really isn't that good. Turn Up That Dial has several really stupid songs on it, I don't care for the acoustic Woody Guthrie albums and their latest song \"Sirens\" isn't good at all, it just seems lazily written like so much of their newer stuff.\n\n\nI still listen to the old stuff and actually just did so today, but I couldn't care less about anything new.",

At Punk in Drublic in Boston he was \u201cunavailable\u201d to play a set with the Dropkick Murphy\u2019s, but he was there and came onstage and sang with The Defiant instead, a band that at the time was supporting RFK, and made up of members who refused the vaccine.  Al Barr also recorded a song with them that was anti-lockdowns / anti-vaccine for their last record.  \n\nHis mother thing is true but the reasons he\u2019s still not with them run deeper.  Now that Casey is saying this stuff at their shows, it\u2019s easy to put 2+2 together.",

I don't agree with that way of looking at the world and society. Allowing someone to have a home is not tolerating their viewpoints or actions. They can be punished for specific directly harmful actions as-needed without deporting them.\n\nI don't have to deport intolerant people. They can live where they live and have a right to live. However we can still speak out against them and ostracize them in social situations where their worldview is wholly and fundamentally incompatible, such as a punk show. \n\nFor the more reasonable ones you can talk like an adult, speak with them and try to both understand what causes them to hold those harmful views and try to change that. For the one's who are unwilling to listen, they can instead be shown that their philosophies are frowned upon and have to make the decision themselves on whether they want to reevaluate their worldview when they see the negative reaction it \n\nWhen we're talking about average people who hold harmful views, unless they are taking direct action to harm others there's no reason to think deporting them is the first course of action. These are humans on a path in their life. Deporting them rather than approaching them as a human only serves to make yourself a villain and further radicalize them as their victim complex will be made into reality.\n\nThe idea that not tolerating intolerance should mean deporting people is just as fascist as what we are speaking out against and entirely hypocritical.",

It\u2019s easier to bring a point across, especially online when most comments are written on phones. Treat it as such.\n\nGeneralisations usually have a fundamental truth in them as well. Just look at the US. Because of evangelical christians individual rights are onder threat. It\u2019s not a given you can be who you want to be and love who you want to love. Because of the \u201cpro life\u201d attitude of Christian hardliners, lives of women are under threat because they\u2019re denied medical care. They even support a billionaire rapist in order to get their agenda across.\n\nSo yeah: maybe feel some empathy before playing a victimcard.\n\nIf I have to draw out a parallel: at this moment you\u2019re the \u201call lives matter\u201d guy in a BLM conversation, or the #NotAllMen idiot when the patriarchy is rightfully under attack.\n\nFascism is the problem, and (on topic:) Dropkick Murphy\u2019s recognise that. They\u2019ve always been pro worker and literally punched Nazis off their stage. Accusing the left\u2019s response against the evangelical Christians as unkind is the most tone deaf accusation you can make during the rise of christofascism.",
