Bands with women(especially on vocals) have way more ladies showing up than normal. Not even just showing up tbh, they're front and center showing out. It's really fucking cool to see. I've always loved heavy music for the community aspect and I love that more people are feeling comfortable to come out and go crazy with us. Bands like GEL, Scowl, Cerce, and Gouge Away are doing great things for the community imo.",
