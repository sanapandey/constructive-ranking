Bands tend to consistently evolve their sound/style (especially global phenomenons), the realities of their fame and ticket demand grow, and our individual tastes change as well.  For the same band to stay consistent in a live performance with the same individual over a span of time has to be so difficult to do.  Not to mention original members leaving or passing away, etc. and how that affects their music and chemistry. \n\nCurious who out of those you've seen three times came the closest to hitting the mark.",
