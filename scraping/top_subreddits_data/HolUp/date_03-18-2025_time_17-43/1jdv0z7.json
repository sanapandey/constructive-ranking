It was more a term for an adversary and the term was applied to Babylon and other nations that were enemies of Judea.  He doesn't even really show up until Job when god fucks with his favorite loyal servant to see how much he can torture him and still make him thank god for it.  Satan just kinda goes along with it as a fellow fun having god.\n\nEven In the NT satan really doesn't even kill that many people and is a minor character.  Jesus sent demons in to pigs and the pigs then killed themselves but that wasn't satan.  How are you calculating satan killing more than god in the bible?  As someone who has studied the bible I believe you are wrong.  Show us oh wise one.  Include all those who died in the global flood and the BILLIONS god will send to hell for eternity even those he knew the future but created them anyway.",

The dead (all of them) go to She'ol, which is a place empty and cold and grey, so far as we have evidence. Exodus mentions 20 that God will harm those who are against him, as well as their children, their grandchildren, and their great-grandchildren, but will bring grace for those who love him, and for thousands of generations after them. Doesn't make strict logical sense, and contradicts with other parts of the bible - so should probably be read allegorically rather than as a strict calculation, saying that God is vengeful, but a thousand times more loving than vengeful, and serves as a warning to love God, not hate him. Either way, there's *no trace of an afterlife there*. Quite the opposite: God's way of rewarding or punishing people beyond their lifetime is by punishing or rewarding their descendants, not by impacting some immortal soul, which doesn't have a trace in these passages.\u00a0\n\nSimilarly, Psalms 53 calls men evil for denying God, and reminds us of his vengeance, but ends with the hope of an end to the Babylonian exile and a return of the Jews to the land of Israel. No trace of an afterlife there.\u00a0\n\nAs much as Christians (and some modern Jews) would like to superimpose heaven and hell, or other forms of post-mortum justice, on the Hebrew bible, there are no serious scholars who think it can be found there. Throughout the bible, people are being promised earthly rewards, as well as many descendants and earthly rewards for them too, and threatened with earthly suffering and with the snuffing out of their lineage. Eternal rewards or punishment for the soul itself doesn't remotely show up.\u00a0",

Denied us Knowledge, making us incapable of understanding the consequences of our actions. Blames us for engaging in actions he made us incapable of comprehending the consequences of. Denies us the fruit of Life (effectively murdering every human who has been born since) based on this crime. Threatens and brings violent death to any who oppose him. It's not exactly clear in the text, there's theological debate over it, but it's at least colloquially accepted he damns all those who don't serve his will to eternal torture.\n\nAlso note, we were told the fruit of Knowledge of Good and Evil would kill us. The serpent told us that was a lie, and that it would grant us Knowledge of Good and Evil. We ate it, and it turned out the fruit wasn't lethal, and in fact granted us Knowledge of Good and Evil. \n\nThat darn, lying serpent. /s\n\nMeanwhile the serpent brought us Knowledge denied to us by God. The serpent told us the truth where God lied to us. The serpent granted us liberation where God gave us metaphysically incomprehensible rules and permanently destructive punishment for breaking them (permanently cast out of paradise and left to die in the wastes without the fruit of Life in physical space, damned to eternal torture in spiritual space.)\n\nWhat's inaccurate here? And don't bring up Jesus, cuz I'm Gnostic and so interpret that whole sequence of events VERY differently to the standard modern interpretation. We're talking God, not Jesus. Assuming Jesus is a different character and not a retcon as is the standard interpretation, what's wrong about any of this?",
