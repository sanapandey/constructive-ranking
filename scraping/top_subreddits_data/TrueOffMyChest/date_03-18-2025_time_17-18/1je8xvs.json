    "selftext": "Years ago, my sister Reta slept with my boyfriend. \n\nUnfortunately for me, i didn\u2019t find out until after I was pregnant. i decided to keep my baby, but I never confronted her about what exactly happened we both just came to the understanding i knew, me and my boyfriend fought about it relentlessly without an audience to watch us. The night I gave birth, she went home with him. I knew it, but I didn\u2019t ask for details I didn\u2019t wanna know what they did. Instead, i went no contact with my sister for good reason. for three years and i focused on raising my 3 beautiful daughters.\n\nFast forward, my boyfriend and I got married, it wasn\u2019t perfect, yes i\u2019ll soon learn to regret it. And yes, Reta was invited. I thought we were past everything, i never held a grudge against her, truly i just let myself walk away. Years later, me and husband divorced, and for reasons I can\u2019t even explain now but nothing to do with Reta. I helped Reta get a job at my workplace. I thought I was being the bigger person and helpful bc i knew she would\u2019ve never gotten a job after she was laid off, (someone bought out their company and she was cut.)\n\nReta climbed her way up to a supervisor role while I remained her boss. And that\u2019s when she showed her true colors, hee true intentions of how truly entitled and miserable she is. flirting with MY boss who has a wife at home. Going out of her way to do things for other employees she doesn\u2019t do for me. Her tone when she speaks is so frustrating bc and sounds ugly. I cant help but thinks she places herself above you at all times.\n\nShe started pushing me out slowly at first but then it got worse, making demands to HR, knowing we were already struggling to keep people. She backed them into a corner, making it clear that they\u2019d lose another supervisor if she wasn\u2019t transferred or if i wasn\u2019t . So HR called me with a \u201csolution.\u201d They could transfer me\u2014to a store an hour away. With no car. No gas card. Nothing. \nI have two cars, one of which won\u2019t make it 20 minutes away and i drive it everyday to work which is 12 minutes from my house. My second car my daughter used to get to school and work, i don\u2019t want to rob youngest daughter of that driving experience as her first time driving. we are trying to set up buying a car for her but money is too tight. She sometimes wakes up at 4am to take me to work when the first car isn\u2019t working. i don\u2019t have the ability to buy her a car for herself. \n\nHR knows my potential and knows if i\u2019m sent to another store i will be able to turn the place around the way i did the place i\u2019m at now. Which Reta would love to take credit for. A lot is going to be asked of me and it\u2019s responsibility i did not sign up for.\n\nI wanted to be promoted on my own terms when i had the fundamentals to provide for it. She is controlling when and how i leave my own store that i worked 8 years to build. \n\nNow, Reta is running around badmouthing me to employees, making herself out to be the victim. And let\u2019s be real\u2014this woman has always been selfish. She lives alone, keeps a fat, uninsured boxer in her tiny apartment, and the poor thing barely sees the light of day except to use the bathroom. An employee, i also consider my friend told me Reta told her about sleeping with my boyfriend at the time (i told friend years prior so she already knew)Reta was almost bragging about it. \nMy friend asked \u201cdid you ever even apologize?\u201d and Reta said \u201cit\u2019s been too long, i think it\u2019s too late now\u201d but not remorseful. \n\nI don\u2019t know why I ever let her back into my life. I should have left her in the past where she belonged. How could your own sister do anything like this.\n\n\nContext: Me and Reta are 2/6 kids (4 boys,2 girls) she is my only sister.\nI have 3 kids all of which have different fathers. she has none.\n\nI am currently married to a man of 5 years now was dating him for 3. \n\nall of this occurred in 2005-2007\n\ni got my sister the job 6 years ago- i have worked there for about 8 years or so years now. She was jobless for about a year and half before i offered it to her.\n\n",

I mean ffs, she married the POS who not only slept with her sister, but did it ON THE NIGHT SHE GAVE BIRTH TO **HIS** CHILD! \n\nNow, she\u2019s worried about being the bigger person. Bet she\u2019s been fed the bs to \u201csuck it for the sake of family.\u201d \n\nOP, if you have any self worth, you need to stop being a doormat and tell HR that you can\u2019t do it as transportation and distance are an issue. If they value you, as you say, they\u2019ll move her. Otherwise, you again need to suck it up and deal with the shitty circumstances that you now put yourself in by letting her back in your life. Go no contact again and let her deal with her own shitty life.",

Offices thrive on gossip, so let the rumor mill do the work. Cry, play the victim, and make sure everyone knows your sister is unstable, trying to steal your life, and you regret ever bringing her into the company. Oh, and don\u2019t forget to drop the bomb that she was screwing your boyfriend while you were pregnant. That\u2019ll get people talking.\n\nThen, take it up a notch\u2014send an anonymous tip to your boss\u2019s wife about the little office affair. Whether she ignores it or burns it all down is up to her, but if it\u2019s true, at least she\u2019ll have the chance to kick him to the curb.",

The second is go to HR and tell them you are unable to transfer due to the distance. However you also want to remind them what you have done for them, and that you would be interested in the new position. Once you inform of your interests, then tell you these are the things you will need to be successful and turn another store around. In your list of demands start with a high salary and willingness to negotiate. That you will need a company vehicle until you can purchase a new one of your own. Or that you're willing to take on a new role of turning around poor performing stores. This new role would include a company vehicle, gas card, and other benefits. If they are afraid to lose a supervisor, then they will really be afraid to lose you.",
