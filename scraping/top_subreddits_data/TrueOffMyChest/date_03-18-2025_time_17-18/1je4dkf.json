    "selftext": "A bit of background, I (F32) have always been a cat person and have never had a dog of my own. My husband (M38) is a dog person, has owned them in the past, and for years has talked about getting a Husky or GSD puppy (his \u201cdream dog\u201d), especially for our two kids to grow up with. I was not into it, because I know they\u2019re a lot of work, but about a year ago, I fell in love with a GSD puppy we met through one of his clients and I was smitten. We\u2019re also done having kids, so I figured having a little pup would help cure baby fever whenever it popped up (and boy, does it!)\n\n\nI spent the last year researching the hell out of the breed and how to be the best possible dog owner possible. I did *not* go into this blindly or impulsively. My husband would talk to me about what kind of training he\u2019d want the dog to go through, he told me about his experiences with his prior puppies/dogs and I felt confident that we would make a great team in this new endeavor. I talked about puppies all the time and my hopes and dreams for what a puppy would bring to our family. It kinda felt like planning to have another baby, I was excited to say the least. We\u2019ve raised two kids (12 & 6) so this wouldn\u2019t be too out of our element, no biggie. And he's a good dad, that's not a problem.\n\n\n\nWe picked a reputable, AKC registered breeder and got on a waitlist, HOWEVER, in January, my husband was contacted by a family member who had gotten a (at that point, 4 month old) purebred GSD puppy for Christmas and could not handle the responsibility.\nMy husband calls me, tells me the situation, we agree to go over the pros/cons and have a family meeting with our kids that night to discuss. Ultimately, we decided to move forward, mainly because the breeder wouldn\u2019t take the puppy back so this family member was just going to take them to a shelter so that definitely tugged on my heartstrings. (Also, the puppy was free as opposed to being $2.500, that was a definite incentive)\n\n\nI want to preface this by saying that I have NO intention of getting rid of this dog. I love her, though she is challenging, but I\u2019m not rehoming her. I knew what getting a puppy entailed, again, I did not go into this impulsively. The husband would be going before the dog does at this rate.\n\n\n(Added info: husband is autistic and has ADHD/depression/anxiety, he is medicated but it only goes so far)\n\n\nDay 1 with the puppy should have been a red flag. My husband brings home the puppy and within an hour disappears into the basement to play a game and I\u2019m left to get her acclimated to the house, kids, and residents felines on my own. Since then, 99% of the puppy\u2019s care has been on me and I have to ask him for help or for a break, which he does\u2026. But makes it clear that he isn\u2019t happy about it. Or I ask him to watch her so I can go shower or run an errand and I come back and she\u2019s in the crate, which pisses me off. I try not to crate her unless absolutely necessary because that\u2019s not right to do to a dog. I am with her 100% of the time except for 2 days a week when I go into the office and he can\u2019t handle a couple hours?\nI am becoming burned out. I cannot leave her alone so if I can\u2019t have my eye on her, I crate her or let her outside onto the deck (attached to a lead for extra security). But she is very, VERY codependent and unless she\u2019s with me, she cries and whines.\n\n\nWe\u2019re 2 months in, puppy is 6 months old, and we have had multiple discussions \u2013 and now a few arguments \u2013 about this situation. I have expressed that he has not held up his end of the deal. The puppy still gets SO excited when she sees him because every single day he disappears into the basement to play video games so he\u2019s still \u201cnew\u201d and exciting to her. He admits the puppy is overwhelming and he really doesn\u2019t feel a \u201cconnection\u201d with her.\n\n \n\nHe told me he only agreed to the puppy because I wouldn\u2019t \u201cshut up\u201d about puppies for the last year and that felt like a slap in the face because HE was the one who had to convince ME to get a puppy all these years.\n\n\n\nI would have been happy to have cats only for the rest of my life. I questioned why the f**k he would have even told me about the puppy when he could have just told his family member \u201cno\u201d and I would have been none the wiser. I thought he wanted her too. And I especially thought this because I literally asked him, verbatim, *\u201cDo you really want to do this? Because if not, please say so. The last thing I want is to push for it and you end up resentful and now I\u2019m the sole caretaker of the dog.\u201d*\n\n\nBut that\u2019s what ended up happening. He doesn\u2019t really like her, so now she\u2019s solely my responsibility.\n\n\nI am overwhelmed and becoming resentful. Especially when he, last night,criticized me for forgetting to do something and I had to tell him \u201cI dropped the ball because I\u2019m currently juggling far too many. So you can either step up or shut up.\u201d (not those exact words, but the message was clear).\n\n\nI am furious because my options are\n\n\n1. Continue to take care of this dog for the next 10-12 years and accept that this is solely on me\n\n\n2. Continue to hold him accountable and keep having the same discussion over and over until\u2026?\n\n\nAgain, rehoming the dog is not an option for me, because I *am* capable of caring for her alone, but I don\u2019t *want* to. I wanted to do this *together* like we planned. It\u2019s not my or the dog\u2019s fault that he didn\u2019t communicate well and agreed to something he really didn\u2019t want. At ANY point in the last year, he could have said \u201cI\u2019m actually not ready for this\u201d and I would have dropped it. Of course I would have been a little disappointed, but that\u2019s life. I was *not* going to get a dog that he did not want. Ever. Period.\n\n\nHe admitted he is thoroughly addicted to the game he\u2019s playing and his \u201conly option\u201d is to just quit altogether because he \u201cisn\u2019t capable of moderation,\u201d but of course this comes with a tone of \u201cfine, whatever will make you stfu.\u201d But I don\u2019t *want* him to help in a way that makes him now resent me but Idk what to do. He says I don\u2019t get to police his tone because he already said that I\u2019m right and I\u2019m getting my way, so no, he doesn\u2019t have to be happy about it.\n\n\nI feel very stuck and angry, I\u2019m no longer thriving at work, home feels like hell, I have a lot less patience for my kids because somedays I am so burned out. Not to mention the housework and the fact **I** myself feel neglected by him.\nI know this will pass. In about a year the puppy will be matured, spayed, and better trained, but God I\u2019m just so pissed off now.",

            "body": "Oh OP - he loved dogs growing up because he did NOTHING to care for them!\n\nThe plan should be this: you accept you are a single mother to this dog. Get her spayed ASAP - like literally as soon as the vet says it is acceptable.  Then (once she recovers) you teach YOUR children better habits. A 12-year-old is fully capable of brushing, walking, playing with a dog. A six-year-old is more than capable of making sure the dog has fresh water and food. Share some of the load.\n\nGet a trainer and work with the trainer and the dog. Teach the dog to treat your husband like the stranger that he is. Teach the dog to be YOUR dog. That is a highly trainable and highly protective breed. Your husband is a big dummy not to realize that being uncaring to the dog means the dog won't see him as part of the pack.",

You not ever leaving that dog by itself is a recipe for disaster, you are setting it up for a giant case of separation anxiety.  A dog, like a toddler, needs to develop self soothing skills and confidence and giving in to the whining and neediness when you aren\u2019t around her is making her neurotic (already an issue in many pure breed GSD).\n\nWhen your husband is at work and your kids aren\u2019t home, get one of those Kongs and put some peanut butter and dog kibble in it. Without saying a word, put the dog in the crate and give her the Kong.  Still without saying a word, leave the room for 20 minutes. Don\u2019t come back in even if she starts whining, wait the full 20 minutes. Don\u2019t make a big deal about letting her out of the crate, don\u2019t say anything, just let her out and go about your day. \n\nDo that a couple times a day and gradually make the times longer. Start keeping her in the crate for a while when you\u2019re doing things in the home, walk by her but don\u2019t react to the whining. Gradually move on to leaving her for longer periods (always try to take her for walks throughout the day to take the edge off while your moving up to longer periods spent alone).\n \nYou want to give your dog the tools to feeling secure on its own. The goal is not to have a dog locked in a crate for hours but a dog that sees the crate as a safe spot and can go in there alone with the door open down the road and just chill. You also are making your dog confident and not needy.\n\nI\u2019m sitting on the couch waiting for a repair guy with our current foster dog, 11 weeks old, snoozing peacefully in her crate in the other room. It was a tough first few days because she barked and whined when we put her in there for brief periods and ignored her (while also taking her for long walks 2-3 times a day and letting her out every hour or so to house train her).  She literally slept all night in the crate without a peep by day 3.\n\nThis is the training scenario we\u2019ve used for dozens of dogs of all ages that have passed though our house. They move on to other families with confidence and manners. \n\nI\u2019m not discounting your love and dedication to your new family member, I\u2019m hoping that my advice helps you break this codependency you\u2019ve developed with your dog. A 6 month old dog should not be the center of a family\u2019s energy and focus, it should be a valued joyful contributor to a healthy dynamic. \n\nAgain, this is separate from your husband\u2019s shitty behavior, I really just want you to give yourself a break as your dog\u2019s caregiver and establish a healthy dynamic.",

Since she likes wet food, put a couple spoonfuls of it in the Kong and let her smell it and lead her in there. Drop it and shut the crate and then walk out of sight. She will be torn between raising a ruckus and eating that delish wet food. Once you\u2019re out of sight she should go for the wet food in the Kong and it should take her a few minutes of focus. \n\nIf and when she starts whining, go ahead and still leave her in there for the 15 minutes but don\u2019t make a peep. If she hears you, she\u2019s going to turn up the drama. And if you react, if you tell her \u201cit\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll be right back\u201d or something similar she\u2019ll get conditioned that the drama works and makes you pay her attention. \n\nIf she ignores the kong with the wet food when you crate her, after the 15 minutes go by, let her out (don\u2019t say a word) and take the Kong and put it out of the way until the next time. Don\u2019t give her the Kong with the wet food outside of the crate at all. \n\nWhen we crate train a puppy or an anxious dog, we get up early and take them for as long as a walk that works with our schedule. We take them off the leash and let them fiddle fart around in the house for a few minutes. We then start with the methods above. Again, when you fill the Kong and have it ready, just let her sniff it, don\u2019t say anything as you put her in there. Drop it in the crate and remove yourself from the room. \n\nAt first it\u2019s probably 4-5 times a day. It\u2019s really hard the first day or two, ignoring their barking is hard. There is a point it clicks with them that the barking and scratching isn\u2019t getting the result they want and they typically lie down and sleep or look pitiful lol. Usually by day 3-5 they start quieting down. Keep the crate door open and when you return from a walk, say \u201ccrate\u201d and throw a treat in there so she goes in there to get it. \n\nDo not feel guilty, you\u2019re not punishing her, you\u2019re providing structure for her to learn she\u2019s safe alone. The goal is to have the crate be her safe space but also getting her to understand that she is okay if left alone.",

You don\u2019t want to reward her whining/scratching/barking etc.  When it\u2019s time to come out, make sure you ignore her until she\u2019s calm.  Also, don\u2019t allow others to talk to her or taunt her when she\u2019s in her crate.  I also wholeheartedly agree with the other comments on here that having her with you all day long is going to have a negative affect on her.  She need to be able to be alone and be ok with not being with you at all times when you\u2019re home. \n\nMy gsd crate trained in a day, but I got him at 9 weeks and he went in his crate to sleep the first night.  (There was more too my method than that though). He was always in his crate when I wasn\u2019t home and at night.  Never for more than a few hours to start - then by 6 months he could be in there all night (but no more than six hours and I did this slowly). I didn\u2019t start allowing/training him to be in the house alone until after he turned a year- and again that was a slow transition.  And he was always still crated if I wasn\u2019t home.  At about 18m I started to allow him to sleep with me in my room and that also helped with training him out of crate for longer periods of time.  By 2yo he was outside the crate in a gated off area all day when I was at work and all night with me.  Crate training imo is super important and \u201csaved\u201d me and pup many times over his life.  I did get really lucky with him that he was super easy to train, I was single and living alone so there were no \u201cdistractions\u201d or someone contradicting my training and was super super lucky to get a gsd that *never* (literally) destroyed anything that wasn\u2019t his.  In fact her never did end up being a bone chewing dog.  I also never used the crate as \u201cpunishment\u201d in his first 2 years because I didn\u2019t want him to associate being in \u201chis\u201d crate with something bad. \n\nI did end up getting him the xxl crate pretty quickly though.  I originally bought a 36\u201d but decided it was gong to be too small and upgraded to the really big 48\u201d taller and wider crate (not a cage but one of the plastic ones with a locking metal door) that he could turn around in and also be able to stretch a bit while laying down.  He wasn\u2019t allowed a blanket/bed though because he would destroy them until he eventually grew out of it.  He ended up being 110lbs and long and tall!   \n\n\nWhat kind and size crate are you currently using?  She also may be having issues going to the crate because there\u2019s too much going on around her and she wants to be with her people.  Maybe try doing a few minutes of crate training everyday when you work on other obedience?  Like make everyone leave the area and in the beginning ask your children to be really quiet in their rooms so that you can have 10min of just you and pup to work on crate in command, treat, wait til she\u2019s calm, let her out, treat, crate in command, treat, lay down in crate, stay (with door open), release and out of crate, treat.  Are you working with a trainer?  IMO you should plan on doing regular obedience training- that\u2019s going to also be prime bonding time with her- I personally also wouldn\u2019t incorporate kids in the actual obedience until pup is much older and you\u2019ve spent time working on training *them* on her commands and being consistent.  Everyone needs to be giving pup the same commands all the time- no daddy walks her his way and you walk her your way- that\u2019s a recipe for disaster (but it really sounds like that wont be much of a problem? At least not right now.  But be prepared for him to suddenly want it done his way once pup is a couple years old and fully trained\u2026). \n\nGood luck- and it really does get easier!  One day in a year or so you\u2019ll have a wonderful adult dog - who I guarantee will NOT grow out of being your shadow- or being *your* dog.",

Our current foster puppy was 8/10 lab mix energy when we got her at 9 weeks. Just a wiggly, thrashing, galloping tornado of energy. We gave her lots of snuggles and playtime but we interspersed with short periods in the crate (and at night). At first she was indignant and barked and barked the whole 15 minutes. About 2/3rds of the way through the second day, she stopped barking during one 15 minute span and just laid down. A couple weeks later now, she just wanders in there and takes a nap. \n\nI think the crate training is good for all the reasons above and also if you plan on traveling with your dog or having them board anywhere.\n\nEdit to add: some dogs move on to their new homes and the people start with the crate but end up not using it because the dog is well trained at that point. Some people keep the crate around because the dog likes to go in there and chill. We strictly use the crate for the initial period when we are teaching them confidence and positive behaviors.",

It sucks, but it seems that this is common in marriages I see in the world around me.\n\nGSD's are pretty nuts as puppies, and will most likely have health issues down the line that you need to be prepared for.\n\n1. Get a professional trainer. Husband isn't going to help and you are new to this. That will help a lot. Bear in mind, the trainer is there as much to train you as it is the dog though! \n\n2. Divide and conquer. Split up tasks to make sure you're both doing parts of the care. Maybe (assuming he works?) you tell him feeding and walking are his duties. Everything else in the day-to-day is yours. That means he is beholden to a regular schedule of feeding and walking daily. Not negotiable. The dog needs exercise and the toilet and it needs to be fed.\n\n3. Your kids are old enough to help - so rope them in too. It is also their pet. They can help with things before and after school and on weekends.\n\n4. Hiding away and playing computer games is what teenagers do. He has to grow the f up! He has responsibilities that can't be shirked. \n\n5. Sounds like you're in America and I don't know your systems etc but here in the UK we have services where people can come and walk your dog or just spend time with them...it's not necessarily a financial exchange but it is for their enjoyment and enrichment for the dog. \n\n6. For the days you're at the office (assuming he is also out of the house working) you may want to pay a walker to come in a few times that day and take her out, etc. Since her seperation anxiety is going to be bad. \n\nI think you're well within your rights to be super pissed off. It isn't like trying on a jumper where you can just go 'Actually no it's not for me'.

I\u2019ve always said the best way to expose who and what a spouse is really like is to get a 12-week old GSD puppy, aka \u201cbrilliant alligator.\u201d\n\nFirst, this husband. Yet another man addicted to gaming that is now not wanting to do anything else but. Exhausting. You make him quit. Remove the console or delete the app, and either he steps up, grumbling and throwing a tantrum, or not. Even without a puppy, he has no business spending his time and finances this hooked on a game. \u201cIf I do xxxx, can I play my game for X hours?\u201d WTF \u2014 he\u2019s not 8yo. Every ask or chore is a \u201cpain in the ass\u201d because what he actually wants to do is the game. It\u2019s not that different from having an affair in that nothing else is as fun or exciting as the new woman, and his \u201cold\u201d family are all tiresome.\n\nHe\u2019s told you it\u2019s all or nothing with this game \u2014 so choose nothing. If he refuses, you have a divorce problem, not a dog problem.\n\nSeriously, it\u2019s pathetic to have this many 40yo men addicted to gaming.\n\nAnd more disturbing about this \u201cman\u201d is that he\u2019s now turned it around on you to make the dog a \u201cyou\u201d thing \u2014 your idea, your responsibility, your doing. A cat person doesn\u2019t go from that to GSDs on their own.\n\nSecond \u2014 the dog. \n\nIf you are set on keeping the dog, might as well do it right. Your dog\u2019s brain is like a sponge \u2014 much like toddlers but at 50x speed because they mature that much faster. And with a good GSD, you get back what you put in. It\u2019s almost formulaic.\n\nEven more than physical exercise, strategic training is more exhausting for a young dog. Routines are everything. The basic obedience training is mandatory but more fun are other exercises like scent tracking. Like I\u2019d boil a chicken breast and cut it into small pieces. While the pup is in the crate, I drag 10 pieces lightly on the floor and hide them everywhere in the house. (Tip: Keep track of where. Trust me.) Then cue the pup as you bring her out of the crate, \u201cSearch!\u201d \u2014 and point her down at the first track. His nose will immediately take over when she smells chicken and most puppies will find it. Then cue the next track, and so forth. Just a basic exercise but eventually, \u201cSearch!\u201d means to put nose to ground and find something that\u2019s hidden. Once the ten are done, it\u2019s outside to go play ball! (You can advance this later on to much longer distances or outdoors for a bigger challenge, or even air scenting.)\n\nObviously, you aren\u2019t training a search and rescue dog, but the activity itself is fun for you and mentally stimulating for the dog. It\u2019s fascinating to watch what their noses can do. INVOLVE THE KIDS. \n\nCombining activities like this with physical play/run makes for a well-trained dog which is a TIRED DOG.\n\nThen, putting the dog in the crate to rest \u2014 she\u2019s more than happy to sleep for two hours.\n\nYou are clearly on your own. Even if your husband does quit, he\u2019ll sit there and pout, and likely not be of much use to you and *your dog.* That\u2019s fine \u2014 he can then take on your other duties in the household be it housekeeping or driving the kids around. Either way \u2014 he needs to quit. If he\u2019s going to let your life fall apart, then he can be unhappy and stewing in his own way too.",

It helps puppies slow down and catch a nap and gives you time to breathe or run errands while she is safe and contained. Please make sure the crate is large enough, though. She\u2019s needs a little space to move around and be comfortable. \n\nAs for the husband\u2014just throw the whole man away.",

Now that it's getting warmer here and more time can be spent outside, can you invite your husband to go on walks with you and the dog? it not only might get your husband out of the basement and help the dog get energy out, but will also allow them to get used to each other. \n\nI'm adhd too and a lot of times once a big decision is made and the results/ consequences are starting to roll in, it can get overwhelming real fast. even if i knew what was going to happen, mentally prepared myself, etc. i suspect that even though he knew it was going to be a lot of work, the reality of the additional work on top of working on top of being a parent, on top of being a husband is making him spiral and he's escaping though games. \n\nit may be worth asking him to bring it up with his therapist. especially if he's saying he's addicted to it. teens/preteens/ kids need their dad around just as much as babies and toddlers. if he's hiding in the basement, he's not spending quality time with your kids. \n\nif your kids still live at home, they can and should be helping out with the dog. we even had the toddlers help with training as it got the dogs used to listening to little humans. \n\nolder kids can help feed/ water the dog before and after school. if your yard is fenced, your kids can even play with the dog before school, which will make it easier for her to be crated since she'll sleep most of the day. \n\nthere's also services and apps where you can have someone stop by and take your dog out on a walk in the middle of the day so they aren't crated the whole time you're away. i didn't feel comfortable using those so i asked my vet if they had recommendations and one of the vet techs walked dogs on their day off, so i suggest also asking your vet if they know of any dog walkers if that's a route you want to go. \n\ni hope this is something you're able to resolve with your husband, but make sure to come up with a plan forward that you can live with if he still refuses to help.",

One thing is to have a pet during childhood years ( family members taking care of it), and a completely different scenario as an adult.\nHis fond memories probably come from all the play time and 0 responsibility. It's somewhat understandable. \n\nBut the dog is here now, attached to you and you, clearly,  love her. \nIn order to relieve you of all the stress, husband should help. If not with the pup, since he resents her ( I don't understand how!),  then housework. Let's not forget, he wanted the dog.\n\nSecondly, you could actually teach kids how to properly care for the dog. Supervised, of course, but still.\nIt will teach them responsibility, will help you unwind a little bit, and, imho, it's fun to grow up around animals.\n\nAlso, game time can be managed. It's a great outlet for stress and a source of fun, but, it shouldn't be a priority. \n\nHope everything works out for the best.",

            "body": "Oh, I relate so hard to this! My sister just divorced a man like your husband and the dog was a major reason. He wanted a breed like GSD too and had had one prior. She wanted a tiny dog since she has an extremely bad back and can't handle a big dog. They agreed all the way that this would be HIS dog, HIS responsibility, HIS job to do training etc and she'd be back up for him and HIS dog.\n\nYeah, you guessed it. She's also really good with dogs, I call her the dog whisperer and she's amazing at positive reinforcement, seeing the situation from the dogs point of view and repeating actions again and again. She trained this dog all the way. It only truly had respect for her. She didn't love-love the dog, it wasn't hers and she was resentful as well. \n\nWell, the interesting thing here isn't that, it's that he actually DID step up when she left. He wakes up at 4am in all weather and goes for long walks, trains her etc. And my sis is just .... Yeah, you can imagine.\n\nIF you leave him with the dog, that MIGHT happen but it's more likely that he's actually a lazy dog owner like me.\n\nI'm being hard on myself, I'm a pain chronic and my three dogs are my entire life. But they're largely untrained and I picked breeds I love (which are stubborn, intelligent assholes) and took out herding dogs since they wouldn't be happy with the life I can provide. My basset and two dachshunds are. They enjoy me being home all the time and I can stimulate them via their noses even in my own yard and house. They get some training but not a lot since I have little energy and I'm pretty OK with their shenanigans. A BIG one is that the basset jumps up - and I DO train my dogs in the areas I need to but jumping up means I won't have to bend so that works for us but it's very hard to train a dog that it's OK to jump up at me for my attention but not do it to others. I explain it to visitors and they know this \"bad behavior\" is something I encourage and they allow it too or push her down. My sister keeps trying to train it out of her when she comes and I love the shit out of her for it since it's not really sticking. Most dogs can function with \"different ppl, different rules\" but not the basset, not yet, at least. We'll see.\n\n  \nIf I were you I'd find help in your kids. The positive reinforcement training methods are so useful to know, not just regarding dogs but ppl. Learning to read what makes others happy and safe is a gift for life. I've always said I'd love nothing more than a boss who'd succesfully trained a dachshund using only positive reinforcement. They'd know how important motivation and self esteem is for being successful and your kids would benefit for life learning this too. \n\n  \nYour husband has a gambling addiction too, not gonna lie about that but I doubt if not playing would make him focus on the dog more either. It's a separate problem, I think. Good luck! And remember, your dog is solely reliant on you for her happiness for her short life. Honor that commitment and yeah, it's OK to resent the shit out of your husband for not honoring it too!",

I understand where he\u2019s at right now bc I\u2019m currently babysitting a baby ferret for a friend, which was unplanned for and we\u2019ve now had her for a month which I didn\u2019t agree to bc I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to meet her needs - but that\u2019s where there difference is. I LOVE ferrets, however I also know they\u2019re in need of nearly constant supervision and play if allowed to free roam instead of being caged, which feels cruel. But I was honest with my bf that I was not prepared for that, and it would be more of him taking care of it, which he agreed to.\n\nAnyway, that problem is on your husband. If he wanted a dog so badly, but had no intention of caring for it the way he should be well aware of it needing if he\u2019s ~such a dog lover,~ then he should have been ready to put down whatever crap he\u2019s wasting his time with to give the puppy the attention and care it needs, AND making sure he\u2019s helping to keep caretaking as balanced as possible between the two of you.\n\nYou married a man-child. Take away his game and let him throw a temper tantrum. I feel mean saying that but really, honestly, what a shitty way to be toward your wife (and kids, and dog\u2026) and then just blame someone else for the situation. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, OP. I hope the situation gets resolved or at least improves asap for you. I\u2019m sure you can ask the kids to help you out a bit with the puppy too, give them some responsibility by helping with it and whatnot if they aren\u2019t already.\n\nEdit - I\u2019m adhd, autistic, depression/anxiety blah blah blah too. I\u2019m aware of my weaknesses and I acknowledge them, but I also push myself to do the best I can bc what kind of partner would I be if I just sat back and let my bf do everything?",
