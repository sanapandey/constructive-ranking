    "selftext": "i'm not looking for advice-- i just want to vent. i'm trying to schedule with a therapist and psychiatrist to get the help i desperately need. i'm just really frustrated.\n\na few years ago, i was happy. very happy. there wasn't another life i wanted to live. i had just graduated university, landed a wonderful job, and was looking forward to start dating. i started to spend more time on the internet, and i couldn't help but notice how many small penis jokes, stories, and insults were on the internet (\"small dick energy,\" \"pencil dick,\" \"fast car small dick,\" \"big truck small dick,\" etc). i immediately became self-conscious, measured myself for the first time, and realized i was the small penis loser everyone was laughing at.\n\ni wasn't able to ignore it. i started to notice women around me using \"little dick energy\" as an insult. i remembered a man at university who was outed by a woman for having a small penis and promptly mocked by everyone. i noticed just how many women openly shared negative experiences with small penises online. i noticed my body was used exclusively for cuckoldry, humiliation, and other very degrading fetishes with pornography. everywhere i looked, i found nothing but negativity. it was very clear my body was an embarrassment.\n\ni was ashamed of my body and immediately spiraled into deep insecurity. i came across a few penis enlargement communities on reddit. i was desperate and wanted a new body, so i immediately started. and broke it. it just doesn't work anymore. i can't get an erection. i can't feel pleasure. i usually can't climax. it's covered in giant veins, discolorations, etc. it really looks so, so ugly. i can't look at my body without feeling deformed and unlovable.\n\nover these few years, i've seen a little over 10 specialists and 10 physical therapists. i had a surgery. i had 5 mris, 4 cts, 2 ultrasounds, nerve conduction studies. i've tried multiple prescription drugs. i tried shockwave therapy, dry needling, and some other treatment plans. i exercise every single day, drink only water, sleep a lot, and maintain a very healthy diet. i've tried and tried and tried. i've spent thousands and thousands of dollars for nothing.\n\nit destroyed my life. i stopped seeing my friends. i leave the house once a month for a physical therapy appointment. i am incredibly lonely and depressed. i've been trying and trying to commit suicide, but i really can't. part of me always believes something is around the corner. just 1 more appointment. just 1 more specialist.",

Don\u2019t be ashamed.. You\u2019ll find someone who likes you exactly for who and what you are. Believe it or not, a lot of women would prefer an average size, compared to a footlong from Subway.",

Most women can deal with different sizes and there are \"toys\" to improve the sex life of a couple that could help if the size is a problem. What women don't want is men that do not try to make things work, that don't want to improve nor care for them, women don't like insecure men with bad attitudes, that's where most of the bad comments come from.\nWhat you wrote looks like a sort of greek tragedy with a self fulfilling prophecy, where you trying to escape a hypothetical situation (where a woman would reject you because of your size) ended up causing a real physical injury.\nAnd I know you don't want advice, but I think that for you to live a better life you would have to put all that physical aspect aside a little, do not focus so much energy on it, and try to improve your mental health and your attitude towards life. There's a whole you to be, a whole life to live.",
