    "selftext": "We were just sitting in the car, not even arguing, just existing. And I looked over at her and in my head, I said, *\u201cWhy can\u2019t she just fucking stop sometimes?\u201d*  \nStop being difficult.  \nStop snapping at me and the kids over every little thing.  \nStop being so damn cold all the time.  \nStop acting like everything we do is a burden to her.  \nJust\u2026 stop.\n\nI hate the position her attitude has put me in. I don\u2019t want to be this guy. I don\u2019t want to feel like I have to find someone else to connect with. I don\u2019t want to spend my nights venting on Reddit like some lonely, pathetic sap, getting dragged by people who think they know everything about love and loyalty and marriage from their high horse. I don't want to be this emotionally starved, bitter version of myself.\n\nI\u2019m tired of being made to feel like a pervert for having the audacity to be attracted to my own wife. For wanting to be close to her. For trying to initiate something beyond just being roommates and co-parents. It\u2019s humiliating. I\u2019m not some creep\u2014I just want connection, intimacy, affection. The basic things people in love are supposed to give each other. But her neglect has turned me into someone I don\u2019t even recognize. I hate that.\n\nI hate that she thinks nothing is wrong, even when I\u2019m telling her something\u2019s wrong. I hate that I\u2019ve spelled it out, tried to have the conversations, tried to fix things\u2014and somehow *I\u2019m* still the problem in her eyes. I\u2019m always the problem.\n\nI hate that she keeps wanting to take pictures as a family\u2014big smiles, matching outfits, Christmas cards\u2014like everything\u2019s perfect. Like we\u2019re not crumbling on the inside. I hate having to fake it for a photo just so she can post it online and feel validated, while behind the scenes, she\u2019s making us all miserable.\n\nShe\u2019s like an overgrown child\u2014emotionally immature, selfish, and exhausting. Everything revolves around her moods, her needs, her wants. Even dinner. She\u2019s so picky we eat the same four things every week\u2014not because we can\u2019t do better, but because she refuses to try.\n\nI\u2019m tired of walking on eggshells. I\u2019m tired of carrying the emotional weight of this house. I\u2019m tired of smiling for the kids while I\u2019m dying inside.\n\nAnd honestly? I hate being judged by strangers as if I\u2019m the worst person in the world because I\u2019m looking for someone to connect with. Like I\u2019m some kind of monster for wanting to feel desired or loved. They don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be trapped in this, to be ignored, to be made to feel invisible in my own marriage. But because I\u2019m trying to make myself feel alive again, they\u2019re quick to throw stones. I don\u2019t need the judgment. I need understanding.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m asking for. Maybe nothing. Maybe just to be heard. To be seen. To feel like I\u2019m not crazy for feeling all this. Because right now, it feels like I\u2019m invisible in my own life.\n\n**Edit:** Forgot to include this\u2014it's not as simple as just leaving, as everyone will obviously chime in and recommend. Financially, it would ruin me. It would ruin my kids' futures. Starting over would put me years behind in any chance at building a life where I'm genuinely happier. My kids would end up with her most of the time, and while I\u2019m sure that sounds like a relief to some, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s here to protect them, to guide them. Leaving would leave them in a situation I can\u2019t stand by and watch. It\u2019s not just as easy as people make it sound.",

Parents pretending they HAVE to do x y or z damaging thing at the cost of their children are lying. Op does not have to stay in his marriage. He just doesn\u2019t want to have to give his wife half of their assets so is staying and likely will cheat on her which will be even more miserable for his poor children. He has a choice to leave and be happier with a bit less money but he doesn\u2019t want to do that",

The UK site even states that equal custody can be given if the father demonstrates he is committed to doing what is best for the child. But as a father who wants what\u2019s best for his children and wants to be at the very least an equal influence on parenting them, those statistics tell me that divorce is a huge risk to my relationship with my children.\n\nI find it disturbing how many people downvote my posts in this thread because they automatically expect fairness in regard to custody decisions in developed countries when the statistics clearly indicate that in the US and UK that isn\u2019t the case. If I were considering leaving my wife (which I\u2018m not), I would be an idiot not to consider the laws and statistics where I live before making that decision.\n\nAnd as for the wife being a fit parent or not or whether or the degree to which her \u201ebad\u201c behavior is influenced by him, of course we are not there and can\u2019t know. I\u2018m sure OP is not perfect, but he does seem passionate about his kids and even his wife and desperate to find a way to make it work. I\u2018m not sure how we can just dismiss his call for help. \n\nAnd I\u2018m not sure what her being a SAHM has to do with anything\u2014 someone needs to earn money and not everyone has the luxury to stay at home themselves or get daycare, even if one parent is unfit. I don\u2019t see how we can give either parent the benefit of the doubt and blame the other for their troubles. It always takes 2, but we can\u2019t rule out that either parent is the greater cause.\n\nBut just getting a divorce as a dad who wants the best for his kids is a huge risk which bears out in the statistics.",

The resumed affair continued for almost 3 years before it, too, fell apart. She got a great boob job, on our dime, which I never got to enjoy. \n\nThere was never any change in her.

Mine divorced sometime when I was around 1yo, hers when she was 10.\n\nThe stories she shares of the fighting and abuse are way worse, not to mention the physical outbursts her father had because of the stress of the situation. Then remember how messy the breakup was. Sure my parents didn't exactly get along but they could tolerate each other long enough to exchange my brother and I every week without throwing punches. Both moved on and had significant others by the time I was 7 or so, and they were both happy with that arrangement such that the divorce mostly blew over and we were all relatively happy.\n\nAs far as financial ruin, being linked financially for another 15-18 years isn't going to help that at all.\n\nEven being alone you'll be happier. And sometimes just separating can get one side to see the mistakes and at least try counselling. Or at least you start to move on.

So are your kids. \n\nSome hard truths: there is no version of this that ends with you staying with her and being happy. She will not \"snap out of this,\" There's a good chance this is baked in, and the further you and the kids drift from her internal image the more she will make your lives miserable. She is incredibly self-absorbed and literally is not concerned with your or your children's happiness. \nMost importantly, she will not love the kids more than she hates you. I can not emphasize that enough! You might think that she won't turn on them or treat them as badly as she treats you. It will happen.\n\nI stayed with a woman like that for 18 years. We broke up when our kid was 10. I tried to co-parent with her, and she just got worse and worse. Eventually, she turned on our kid for an incredibly petty reason and did her level best to destroy their life. My kid and I have no contact with her now, and she doesn't know where we live now because of what she did to them*. \n\n*She kicked them out (they moved into my place full time) then claimed she had lost literally all of their identity documents. She had also lied to me and them about them having certain government documents and had been sabotaging their education.

If so you can ask him/her how to LEGALLY obtain evidence.\n\nAlso how old your kids are, is she a SAHM? Is she able to return to work but refuses to do so.\n\nNo marriage is worth staying in forever if you are miserable. You may think your kids do not know but the reality is that if they do not know for sure now they will soon enough. Our kids learn by example and you are teaching them not to prioritize their mental health and happiness by staying in a miserable marriage. Is that really one of the first core life lessons you want to teach them?!?!\n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAnd if we are being brutally honest if you are miserable what makes you think your kids are not also miserable. That can lead to early childhood trauma that can take years to unpack.\n\nProbably not. Meeting with an attorney will give your clarity and time to gather evidence to build a case. By doing so you are playing the long game, setting a goal, getting your ducks in a row and planning for a happier future.",

Go to therapy, get yourself in a better place. You and your therapist can work on ways to convince her to do couples therapy if you insist on staying.

I could've see anything was wrong because I was just so used to barely functioning this way. I'm not justifying your wife. I was wrong too. I had to get into counseling. I'm probably going for medication soon. I'm sorry you're dealing with this. In finally admitting to myself there was a problem, I was able to be vulnerable to my husband again.

I wish I could give you a mirror that would work on her. Self awareness is the only thing that will help her. I'm not sure if she's as miserable with herself as she seems to be with the world, but I'll tell you that it was this way for me. It just got to the point it was so routine,I became blind. I'm doing better now, but it's still slow. I acknowledge this too. Can you show her this post? Will she make herself the victim in her mind if she reads this? Is there someone else that she's close to that can talk to her? I really feel for you and hope you can fix your marriage. I know you said you can't fiscally separate, but if she refuses to work on herself or see herself for what's actually happening, you need to start making moves.

But what you do about them, is what determines your character, and right now it reads like you just want justification to go outside your marriage. Which is a shitty solution to a crappy situation. Not to mention it would make an inevitable break-up with your wife make even more disadvantageous for you.\n\nI understand your very human need for connection, emotional proximity, physical closeness, ... all of that. I deeply empathize and wish you had those things wholeheartedly, because you deserve them. If you are so deeply unhappy in your marriage, talking yourself into a martyr complex isn't doing anyone any favors. Least of all your kids; they're not blind. You're doing more damage than you can ever know by staying trapped like this. To your kids, but also to yourself. Don't.\n\nYou say you'd be financially ruined - why do you think that? Have you done the math? Has a professional validated your math? Have you consulted a divorce attorney? If you're that intensely miserable, do something about it. Get your ducks in a row. Make a plan. Work steadily towards your exit and follow through with it. It might take time, but every step in the right direction is a good one. It might make your remaining time with her a little more bearable.\n\nThen, take time to heal. Because as I said: this situation has put you under sustained emotional distress, which is severely damaging. You're at risk for falling for the first person who shows you any kind of decency. When you're starved, anything will taste good. Do not fall into that trap, re-build yourself first.\n\nGood luck.",

Or she has a terrible sense of smell idk). But I don\u2019t know how I knew she was pregnant\u2014 she couldn\u2019t have kids! I knew this! I was adopted for this exact reason! But I knew. \n\nI agree that kids should know zero things about your sex life, but if you\u2019re cheating, they\u2019ll know you\u2019re going out with someone\u2014 whether or not that someone remains consistent. \u201cOh yeah dad is \u2018working late\u2019 again. Wonder if he\u2019ll come home before bedtime, or if he\u2019ll get back at midnight with a bounce in his step and smelling like he just took a shower.\u201d (This is age dependent of course\u2014 three year olds will not know). \n\nOne can argue that it\u2019s better for the kids for dad to be happier some of the time, even if that means they know he is seeing someone. I personally think that sets them up badly for their own future happiness, but there aren\u2019t a lot of great choices in this scenario, and the argument can be made. But I think it\u2019s unrealistic to imagine they won\u2019t know, especially if it goes on for years. \n\nYeah, kids can tell when you\u2019re sad. I think the sadness behind the brave face will be pretty palpable to them too. Kids have a big inner life, but they put a lot more focus on their parents, who they love, than their coworkers do.\n\nBut in general, I agree that people should be able to put on a face for their kids, in one sense to protect them, but if nothing else, to show them that happiness and meaning can be things we are capable of making for ourselves even when things are pretty bad.",

Instead of 2 parents that were miserable together, she now has 4 parents that are active in her life and support her, and her children now have 2 extra grandparents.

If she\u2019s pissed about traffic, it\u2019s my fault. If she\u2019s pissed about work, it\u2019s my fault.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not sitting back doing nothing\u2014*I\u2019m the one doing everything*.

And I don't get the sense that you've done anything concrete (talk to a lawyer, a financial advisor, realtor, friend or family member who could help, or therapist) to find out whether the very common fears you have are really the dealbreakers you've decided they are, or to find ways around them. At least here, you seem to dismiss the idea that you have any agency completely. Instead, your wife is a villain (she does sound extremely unpleasant), and you are the helpless victim of her villainy. You've asked her to change herself many, many times, but she refuses. So there's nothing you can do. You are stuck.\n\nRespectfully, as awful as your life is now, it does have some significant upsides. It's consistent and known, which makes it safe in the way that \"not having to work or think too much about a situation\" is safe. You don't have to take risks or problem solve or cope with any change, because it's never going to change because it's hopeless. You may never really succeed at anything if you stay where you are, but you won't fail at anything either. You don't have the burden of wondering if you could maybe do better or should have done anything differently. There is no better and things will never be different.\n\nBest of all, you are totally off the hook for any and everything bad. \\*You\\* aren't the problem. She is. You aren't the reason your life is unhappy and you can't reach your goals. She is. You aren't mean or sick or crazy or unreasonable or unwilling to listen or compromise or work hard, because she is all of those things. As long as you stay where you are, no one can blame you or hold you responsible for anything. Especially not your own self.\n\nWhat if you left and your life still sucked? What if you found that a lot of the problems that led to you being in this mess came with you? What if you didn't or couldn't accomplish all of the things you just knew you were capable of, if only she weren't holding you back and dragging you down? What if there were no one to blame but you?\n\nI don't AT ALL think that the \\*real villain\\* here is you. I don't think that it's actually all your fault that your wife treats you this way and that you are actually an oblivious dick who is blind to what he's doing. I ABSOLUTELY think that you are benefitting somehow by staying in this relationship, though, even if you don't realize it. Otherwise, if it and she are as bad as the exhaustive descriptions you've offered, and you hate it as much as you say, you would be asking totally different questions. You'd be asking \"What is up with me that I can't leave?\" \"Why do I continue to subject myself to this awful treatment?\" \"Are there any resources out there for men in abusive relationships?\" \"How do I protect my children from this environment until I'm able to get out?\" \"Does anyone need a roommate in the xx area?\" \"Does anyone know a good divorce lawyer who will give me a free consultation?\"\n\nWhenever I read a post from a man or a woman and they describe the kind of miserable situation you're in, and then they go onto say \"I asked him about counseling, but he refused, so I guess that's out,\" my instincts start to suggest that something else may be going on here. Unless she or he has you trapped in the house and so financially abused, brainwashed, monitored, and terrified that \\*you\\* can't get therapy for \\*yourself\\*, something's up. It suggests a lack of awareness that may be contributing to the strife if a person says that \"Well, my partner who is the problem refuses to fix himself, and since I'm obviously fine and couldn't learn anything from counseling, I guess my work here is done and the problem remains.\"\n\nYour relationship is so soul-killing that you are about to go through all the effort and planning and subterfuge to cheat on your wife, but it's not so soul-killing that you'll talk to a therapist or lawyer? It doesn't add up. You are benefitting from this dynamic in some kind of way. Figure out what that is, and you will figure out how to end this relationship in a way that solves more problems than it creates. But be careful, because figuring it out may also help you save it. And then the fact that you do have choices will be much harder to deny than it is right now.",

We are still together, he retired last Feb and things got better after that. I dont regret staying, but I wish I had done some things differently.

He has apologized for being so mean to me. We started dating when  I was 17 and he was 22 (this was in the late 80\u2019s, so wasn\u2019t considered bad back then) we have been married for 35 years, together for 38. \nI am sorry you are found thru this, if you stay, you are going to have to accept that she is the way she is, and dont expect anything from her.

The thing we want men to do, is to MAKE PLANS for cooking and vacations etc, it's the mental load behind the tasks. \nTry checking out some mental work coaches online, you can see lots of things for free for example in Instagram, and from 10ish videos you should see if you understand what mental work is, and if you are actually doing that or are leaving all of it to your wife. \n\nMental work is difficult to explain, so during an argument a tired partner might not know how to explain to you what is the actual reason to be negative, behind the small thing that made her/him explode this time. Because 95% of the time there is some other frustration or tiredness or poblem or what ever behind the shitty behaviour.",

Fo you write them down for yourself on a list and go to shop without mentioning it to your wife, and buy the stuff that is needed? Or do you expect the ingredients to be there when u need so that you can cook for the family? \nBecause the actual cooking is not the biggest part of the meal plans, it's the constant awareness of what ingredients you have, planning future meals ahead and writing missing things on grocery list, and going to the shop to buy them in time. The cooking, anyone can do it once all the previous work is done. If you just ask her \"do we have this or that?\" And \"we don't have xx, buy it when u go to shop\" etc, you are still pouring big part of the work on her. Which can be exhausting.\n\nIt is different to cook and to take full responsibility for a task in the house, so that the partner does not need to even think about it. Then the partner can take full responsibility of some other part of your daily life. The planning, the thinking, the doing, all of it. \nIf you do one small part of most of the household work, and she is doing all the mental work behind everything, then she will still be more tired and resentful than you. That is a fact. The mental load is the heaviest to carry, learn to help her jn that. Divide all the work (including thinking and planning) equally to both, then it is fair.",

When you imagined the relationship you would grow into, I bet it wasn't this. And I bet this isn't the way you want to see yourself.\n\nYou sound a lot like me from a few years ago. I was being criticised for everything, my time was never my own, I saw myself as a cash machine, butler and handyman and I was being starved of all forms of affection. \n\nAnd like you, I saw that I was becoming someone that I loathed. I like seeing myself a the person who brings calm to others. But when we disagreed, it turned into an argument, that turned into shouting and would only calm down again once I joined in the shouting. It was like she wanted to see me in distress before she could let the situation deescalate.\n\nI had life threatening depression.  And I couldn't see any way out. We were both working full time and every spare dollar we earned was paying off our mortgage.\n\nWhat I changed:\n\nI started saying No. What was going to happen if I didn't do as I was told? Get yelled at? Ok, I was already dealing with that. Get no affection? That was already happening as well. So I started doing what I wanted to do. I did my share of the housework, I was a great dad to my kids, but when she wanted to fill my weekends with projects, I said no. When she wanted help with her work, I said no. \n\nI learned boundaries. If she yelled at me, I would leave the house. If she called me names, I would leave the house. I made sure the spare bedroom was made up for me any time I needed to sleep away from her. You would be surprised how peaceful it is to just separate yourself away from the rage.\n\nI started journaling. She would twist what I had previously said and flat out lie about things I had done. Journaling prevented me from being gaslit. When we would argue, I would write down what was said and done, without judgement. This allowed me to review my own behaviours and do a better job of preparing myself for the next argument. I also was able to use it as a review tool so that if she told me that I had said or done a thing, I could go back and see if she was right. \n\nFinally, I stopped all forms of sex. I mentioned earlier, I was starved of affection. If she was mad (and she was mad at me for something or another all the time), we had no hugs, kisses or sex. I was always initiating all sex and most of the time I was being shut down, often ruthlessly. I came to the realisation that I was trying to have sex with someone who didn't desire me. There's a name for guys like that and again, I didn't like seeing myself that way. I told her that if she wanted to live in a marriage without sex, we could try that. \n\nIt was that last one that finally drove her to the realisation that the marriage was at stake. Forget about the years of me telling her I was unhappy, all the times I begged for us to go to marriage counselling, the times she threatened divorce, the name calling and gaslighting. That told its own story.",

You him on a burner or something?\n\nA woman is not a narcissist if she wants affection before wanting to have sex. Most women want some kind of affection or positive romantic interaction with their partners before their partner tries to initiate. And not ONLY when their partner is going to initiate after. \n\nIts like the story on here of a woman who HATED when her husband offered to give her back rubs, because she realized he only ever offered when he was horny and would expect sex afterwards, and refused to grasp what the issue was. \n\nOPs needs matter 10000%,, but usually, when someone's wife or husband's libido isn't there anymore, it's 1 of 2 things \n\nHormonal issues,, or their partner not meeting their needs. \n\nAlso, saying she's a narcissist for making the same 4 dishes every week is ridiculous. If she's the primary caretaker of their kids, looks after the house, and makes meals throughout - she may very well just be making things she knows and is most cost effective or most likely for the kids to actually eat. Edit: or even just making what's easy and will keep her family fed.\n\nWe're only getting OPs POV here. Its good to remember that. We only know what he claims she is like, while he's over here frequenting adultery subs and talking about wanting to cheat. If one truly loves and respects their partner, even when the ship is sinking, they would leave them before they ever cheated.",

You say she is snappy, difficult, cold.  Have you ever thought there is a reason why she is acting like this? Have you thought about your role in her moods? That she is probably emotionally and physically exhausted taking care of you and the kids. She probably isn\u2019t getting the help and support she needs from you.  I could go on and on why she is acting this way.  Take a look in the mirror and I guarantee the answers are staring back at you.",

I get the financial aspect of it, now, but you can take steps to protect yourself now. Talk to a lawyer, obviously, and take those steps. \n\nI don't know if this is new behavior for her, or if she was always like this, but many of us women begin having hormonal changes in our 30s. It doesn't explain, much less excuse, all of this behavior, *but* if she were to go get labs and find that things were off, you might notice a shift back towards the wife you married. \n\nYou said she's said no to counseling. Go for yourself, and get your kids in. Maybe she'll eventually see that she could benefit, maybe not, but you can only do what's best for yourself and your kids. If it comes down to divorce, that'll be a point in your favor anyway. \n\nShe can keep her head tucked in the sand if she so chooses, but you can choose to set a better example for your kids. Show them how to stand up for yourself, and set healthier relationship standards. It'll be hard, and will likely make things harder than they are now, because you're going to rock her status quo, but it's necessary if you're going to save your own mental health, and prevent your kids from modeling similar relationships as adults.",

It would be good to give her some time every week alone for self-improvement, therapy, self-care, whatever she's missing. \n\n\nAnd whatever you do, do NOT disregard the hell that is peri-menopause. Your wife may need to talk to a specialist about HRT if she needs it - nobody tells women about the changes our bodies go through as we age, and it can be genuinely alarming. Her clitoris can literally *atrophy*! **I REPEAT, VAGINAS DETERIORATE WITH AGE**, and doctors do not warn or treat us for it. We have to educate and seek out help for ourselves.

They don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be trapped in this, to be ignored, to be made to feel invisible in my own marriage. But because I\u2019m trying to make myself feel alive again, they\u2019re quick to throw stones. I don\u2019t need the judgment. I need understanding. \n\nPlease tell me this paragraph is not saying that you're on Tinder trying to find someone to cheat with, because that's good grounds for people to be judgemental.\n\nAsk about attending couples therapy? Maybe with a mediator your wife might be able to hear you out? Also, be aware that \"you're making me miserable in every aspect of my life\" is not easy to hear, and that might be why you did not get much results from these conversations.\n\nAnd, to give a potential explanation: you seem to be asking for sex a lot (using different words in your post, but it seems rather obvious), and while you would like her to ask as much as you do, it may just not feel that gratifying to her? You're describing someone who is stressed out, probably cooking the same four things because that's what she knows how to do, trying to keep up appearances, probably snapping at little things because she says nothing over the big ones. \n\nShe's probably as frustrated as you are, and thinking as many bad things about you as you do about her. Better communication is crucial, and if that's difficult, again, couples therapy is here to help. \n\nAnd maybe neither of you wants to make the effort, because you're just tired of each other. It's fine too. But don't stay together just because of the children\u2013down the line, they would be much happier with a happy mum and a happy dad, and if it can't be with them being together, so be it.",

You are mad at your wife, and mad at the situation that you are in, but I am only hearing one side of the story here.  Why is she mad?  Is she just evil, because your post makes her seem like an evil shrew.  Maybe she is, but generally, most women aren't acting that way in a vacuum.  She probably senses your obvious contempt and is reacting to that.  There might be years of shit to unpack here.\n\nBut if she refuses therapy, its time to leave.  My guess is you think cheating might get you towards that goal, as it being a point of no return, but it just will hurt you more than anything in the long run.",

Only  about 6% of all men want to keep their kids and ask the courts, the rest is due to issues with the mother. About 40% of all courts across the country try to go for equal parenting time. The child support goes to the custodial parent, not just the mother. Same thing with spousal support, the parent that put work in the house, therefore giving up their high earning years and upward mobility; gets (the agreed upon) assistance once they can return to the world. If both continued to work then that's probs why that's done on a case by case basis.\n\nYou could ask for a divorce and primary custody. Keep a record of her actions and use that in court to prove that your kids mental health is being risked, if it's this serious. If it's this bad why won't you protect your kids from a mother who is bent on hurting them. It's destroting them and you're watching it, is this the actions of a father?\n\nTo me, sounds more like you dumped all responsibility onto your wife and now you're mad she's militant, but don't want to put in real work in your relationahip with her, your kids, your own house even. Just having a job isn't 50/50, how about you take the household for a weekend, including meals, cleaning, bath time, homework, everything for several months and see if that helps improve her mood. 100% this woman married a man who wanted a mommy.",

The expectation is that she will pay for her own things if she has the income to do so. Doesn't matter if you've been paying for all the house things, she has income at play here - this isn't a SAHM situation. Anyways it will only get more expensive the longer you wait, as most payments are calculated based off the years together - so cheaper to start the process now than in 10 years!   \n  \nI don't know where you are living, so i can't say anything for certain. But if she has been bringing in an income for the past years, that is a huge advantage for you.  If you look online, you can likely get an estimate for how child support payments would work out, based on who is earning more - but her income WILL be considered.  Things aren't the same as they were 20 years ago.  The standard nearly everywhere is 50/50 custody, so good chance you would split parenting, and the child support would only be an amount to supplement her income with some of yours (assuming you earn more) on the days she has the kids.   \n  \nIt won't be easy, but i think you're overestimating how financially difficult it would be.  The hardest situations are those where one has been a stay at home parent for decades, but that isn't your case. The court will consider hers and your incomes over the past 5-10 years to determine any child support / alimony.  And will start from a place for 50/50 custody. Get a good lawyer early, do what they say, and you can start moving towards a happier life!  \n  \n***ALSO: DOCUMENT EVERYTHING! Start making a folder of texts / voicemails / emails / etc. that shows how things have been going. Who pays for what. How you are being treated, how you treat her - EVERYTHING you can think of! Evidence is always valuable***",

Starting over would put me years behind in any chance at building a life where I'm genuinely happier. My kids would end up with her most of the time, and while I\u2019m sure that sounds like a relief to some, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s here to protect them, to guide them. Leaving would leave them in a situation I can\u2019t stand by and watch. It\u2019s not just as easy as people make it sound.\n\nyour kids already hate teh current conditions. Chances are she COULD be better alone without having someone to snipe out, being more busy, working if she doesn't know or just having more to do, cooking, etc, so she has less time to be a bitch. She might also just stop being a bitch because she's dating and trying to get a new husband so acts nice.\n\nRegardless your kids would have time away from her which they currently don't, and if she's a terrible mother you can fight for full custody in the future and as they get older they can choose to live with you rather than her.\n\nSaying you'll be years behind building a life where you're happier, that's nonsense, your current path is a dead end with a partner who has no interest in being happy. Every day you stay is an extra day it will take you to build a happier life.\n\nFinancially? You already likely pay money to your wife and for kids, you just don't wall off that part of your savings and call it alimony, spousal support or child support.\n\nWill it be a pain sure, but again the sooner that process starts the sooner it ends. If you've been married for 5 years lets say she gets 2.5 years spousal support, so that's a time frame, an end point. every day you stay again that timeframe moves back, if you leave in 10 years, you'll be paying an extra 5 years spousal support, or if you left after 20 years in a lot of places you might be paying spousal support for life or till she remarries.\n\nLeaving will work out better for you and them and the sooner you do it the better. If you cheat, your kids will be more angry at you, they might be less willing to come stay with you, they might find both homes to be awful.\n\nCurrently they still deal with your wife regardless, all you're doing is keeping them around her more by refusing to leave and again every day you stay you make leaving harder financially for a longer period.\n\nthe only choice is leaving and thinking it's hard is just not understanding it gets harder they longer you're together. You won't be happy with her. Talk to a divorce lawyer, ask them how much it will cost you to leave now and how much it will cost to leave her in 5 years, or 10 years and realise staying just digs you in deeper.",

You\u2019re not crazy for wanting connection, intimacy, and to not feel like a stranger in your own home.\nBut reading this, I can\u2019t help but wonder\u2026\u2026what if your wife is drowning in something she doesn\u2019t know how to express? You mentioned she snaps a lot, seems cold, acts like everything is a burden, and is emotionally distant. That sounds like someone who might be overwhelmed, overstimulated, or even dealing with depression. Not saying that excuses anything, but it might help explain why she\u2019s become this version of herself that\u2019s so hard to be around. How do you both handle stress? Does she have an outlet? Do you? Sometimes when someone is constantly snappy and detached, it\u2019s because they feel like they have nothing left to give, like they\u2019re just surviving. That doesn\u2019t make it right, but if that\u2019s the case, then she might need help figuring out how to get back to herself. And if she won\u2019t acknowledge the problem, that\u2019s a whole other battle. I know you said you\u2019ve tried to talk about it, and I get how frustrating it is to feel like you\u2019re the only one trying. But maybe the conversation needs to shift. Instead of talking about the relationship issues, maybe start with her, how she\u2019s feeling, if she\u2019s okay, what\u2019s weighing on her. Not in an accusatory way, but in a way that lets her know she\u2019s safe to open up. If she is struggling with something like burnout or depression, she might not even realize how much it\u2019s impacting you and the kids. That said, you deserve to feel wanted, respected, and not like you\u2019re just a ghost in your own home. It\u2019s not sustainable to keep walking on eggshells, and you shouldn\u2019t have to beg for the basic emotional needs that make a marriage more than just a living arrangement. If she\u2019s not open to change or conversation, then what? That\u2019s the hard part. Because staying in a miserable situation just to avoid financial ruin or custody battles still chips away at you over time. If she refuses to meet you halfway, you have to decide if being emotionally trapped is something you can endure long-term. No easy answers, but you\u2019re not crazy for feeling this way. And you\u2019re not alone.",

This does not necessarily excuse her behavior but a lot of women have been taught to never discuss this & resources were not readily available about this. She may even be unaware that this is what is happening to her. It causes terrible mood related symptoms that make a lot of women that were previously warm, romantic, engaging, into seemingly cold, hard tired all the time, angry all the time, not in the mood ever kind of people. So I\u2019m just offering a clinical perspective that may apply to her personality changes. Low estrogen will lead to no desire to be intimate even in non-romantic ways. As I assume she\u2019s nothing like the woman you fell in love with, it\u2019s definitely a change. Perimenopause can be treated with hormones & other things including therapy. Good luck to you both.",

Which one would you like them to copy as adults? How do you imagine them treating relationships in the future? \n\nLet's be clear, if I stayed single forever it would have been better.

She could be extremely burnt out, highly overstimulated, deficient in certain nutrients or vitamins, hormonally imbalanced, touched out. I know this is the case with me because of how young our kids are but the chronic low energy, poor eating habits (aka not eating enough food with substance/protein), and sleep deprivation all contribute to my own irritability and lack of patience.

Concerned with having the entire family mask to look socially acceptable.\n\nSo, all we need here is one of the trifecta, and we can call it. Which one of these 3 (or all 3) is she oddly obsessed with: plants, animals (especially ones she doesn't own), or makeup? \n\nSounds like you married an undiagnosed autistic woman. Possible ADHD, but, that's only an addition, not a 'or' ... \n\nRAAD-S. Google that. \n\nDo yourself a solid, no judgment. Take that for YOURSELF. Record the score. Screenshot that shit if you have to. \n\nNow, if I think of your wife, and if --big if-- she's undiagnosed, and everything is your fault, there's some story or things that happens, that when you tell it, she blames you being ... the way you are. Probably in a \"you're dumb\" way, but may in a \"youre weird\" kind of way. \n\nMake up one of those. Say, that happened, and someone called you autistic--make it sound like a joke to you. You were brushing it off. Say something like, \"so I went online and took a test to see if I was.\" And shake your head like you got some unexpected result. \"What a weird ass test. Just asked a bunch of questions ... most seem like what everyone does.\" Now think of ONE--just one--of the questions that would fit your wife. \"Like, do I X, always, sometimes, never.\" Do not tell her if you answered never, when you took it. \n\nShe's probably going to ask what other questions. Pretend you forgot. You don't know, it's silly. \"You want a link to it?\" You joke, \"and we see what it tells you? Because, my mind was blown when I got my score \" DO NOT share your score. Don't even hint. Lord it over her as a prize at the end of a fight. She gets yours, when you get hers. Be funny n make it a game. Joke about it while the topic is there. \n\nI can almost bet, she sits right then and there, and does the test. Shell share some score, like 157, believing it's perfectly normal. All those questions WERE normal to her. \n\nBut, now you share your score. \n\nIf she won't take it, take it again, but as if you were answering for her. Oof. Don't do this unless she wont--the trick shoukd work. If it does, she needs to know. \n\nAnd now you know, if she scores that high, a possible path forward in relationship, life, etc. You can develop strategies to help navigate a marriage, once you know, that's like unlocking a door. Even if she won't change, or can't, there's ways to approach behaviors and romance that work for people with autism, slightly better. Plans, for example. You CANNOT hint, or be spontaneous, that just screams \"chaos and disorder\" to her, a huge turn off. But planning a thing. Line out an explicit date, and stated outcomes, helps. \n\nSo, \"surprise! Since the kids left tonight, we're going out!\" And expecting romance because kids are gone, is going to fail. \n\n\"Hey, I was thinking, if the kids can go stay at Grandma's Friday night, that we go out to X. After, we go to *place to watch the stars in a truckbed* I'll get all the stuff packed, pick up a mat for a bed. It's been a long time since we've been spontaneous ... Like that.\" \n\nYou will have the menu to the place you want to go, ready as a link to send to her phone. You will have the GPS of the place to watch stars, ready to send on Google Earth. You will do this 5 days in advance. On day 4, you will stop at a store alone, and say you are there to pick a bed-mat for the truck, and want input between two. Take a picture of two. Not the shelf, not 3, TWO. On the floor of the isle. Take the one she picks. She will pick.  When she does, remind her how excited you are for this (even if this amount of prep is killing you). \n\nIt will take that many days for her to not feel like the plan caused chaos. It will take that many days for her to hype herself up, and let the anxiety build--and then drop off. It is time for her to \"mask\" and set her mind to the role she wants to play here. \n\nSo--you dont have to do EXACTLY that, but that's the shift that works. I know.",

My dad would literally take his dinner into his bedroom and eat it there just to avoid having to deal with her. But unlike OP, he seemed to blame us kids for her relentless unhappiness. If she had a meltdown and he had to leave his store and come home to deal with it, he\u2019d blame us for being \u201cbad\u201d. He claimed he didn\u2019t want to divorce her because she was a SAHM and would\u2019ve gotten full custody and turned us against him. This was back in the 60s, so he was probably right about her getting full custody. But he could\u2019ve spent weekends with us. Problem is, he wasn\u2019t that into us. We rarely spent any time with him as it was because he spent most of his days escaping her by hiding at his store, even resorting to opening it on Sundays. I think he knew that if he divorced her, his weekends would be spent having to actually hang out with his kids.\n\nAfter we all grew up and left the house, he still refused to divorce her. When we asked as adults why he remained in that hellish marriage, he finally told the truth. He didn\u2019t want to have to sell the precious house he\u2019d had custom built and didn\u2019t want any to lose half his money. He never once thought of all the emotional trauma he made each of us endure for 18 years. Now they\u2019re both dead (she thankfully died first, giving him 11 years of peace before he died). \n\nMy parent\u2019s horrific marriage fundamentally changed who we were. We\u2019re all depressed and anxious. One sister is a hoarder, another sibling is a compulsive gambler. I have trouble making friends because I view every person as a potential source of pain. Do your kids a favor. Either divorce your wreck of a wife or tell your kids her behavior is not their fault and try to spend a lot of time with them, away from her. They\u2019ll still end up damaged but at least they won\u2019t hate you almost as much as they hate her.",

The eggshells, the mood swings, the lack of intimacy, the deep loneliness when your partner is RIGHT THERE. \n\nIt broke my heart and opened my eyes to how selfish and broken of a person I was, how angry I was and how I was willing to unleash that on others.

Therapy therapy therapy. I went to a psych and said 'please make me better, I don't want to be this person anymore'. I got diagnosed with various mental disorders, like confirmed ADHD and (at the time, now in remission) BPD. Which meant I had ZERO regulation skills as an adult for big emotions and problems, and I only knew how to react. \n\nWe are so much better now. We listen to each other. I looked at myself, saw a selfish and narrow-minded person, and I fucking changed. Why? Because my husband, my life partner, my soulmate, told me I was the cause of his pain, of his despair, of his loneliness. I was hurting him deeply, every day. I was and still am disgusted by how blind I was to his needs, and I spend every day trying to be open, vulnerable, caring with him, that I listen to his hurts and offer him a gentle place to lay down his pain. \n\nYou need to have a REAL talk with your wife. Maybe she cannot see past her own pain and hurts. Maybe she doesn't know another way? I well and truly did not realize the affects of my actions. I was raised this way - no one taught me different. But looking at myself was HARD because I saw what a shitty human I had become. It was very, very humbling and very hurtful to see what I'd let myself be. \n\nBut it is our right and our responsibility to heal and better ourselves from our traumas and pasts, to be a genuine human being who tries their best. Talk to your wife. It could turn out to be the absolute hardest, worst, and best thing ever. \n\nI adore my husband, I'm grateful he hurt me so deeply with his truth. I needed to be woken up.",

            "body": "So, to be honest, my relationship was like this for many years. My wife didn't connect with the kids in a motherly way (no disrespect). I'm not sure if the antidepressants they had tried to help with post partum didn't help, although she tried many. She would lash out, and every mistake they made, she would demean their character and chip away at their self-esteem, calling them stupid and things of that nature. I wanted to keep our family together, but she wouldn't do counseling. Neither individual nor marriage. I was lost. I never hated her.  I would randomly bring home flowers and help around the house. If she wanted to have a job, she hated it. If she stayed home, she hated it. I never could make her happy with anything I did and the kids weren't being treated the best by her. I eventually divorced, but honestly I don't think that was best in the long run. The kids hated their time at her home. She started drinking with her new partner and tried drugs. He was initially only abu*si*ve to her, but in recent counseling notes I guess it turned to the kids for about 5 years until I finally got full custody. In retrospect I would've rather had my kids grow up in one dysfunctional household with one loving parent, than endure what they did. I wouldn't cheat, I'd just say do counseling and try to find some peace in ultimately keeping your kids safe and loved by you. In my state they favor the mother, even though I could prove abuse, and CPS was too afraid to go there as he had threatened to k*llc anyone who stepped foot on the property,  and they don't allow the kids to testify, so it took 7 years to get them out of a much worse environment than being in our home where I could at least protect them better in hindsight. My divorce cost me 250,000. A debt that is so hard to payoff and my kids got hurt emotionally, physically and some did some self h*rm to cope. I'd sacrifice my own happiness over what the alternative turned out to be. When we were together there was rarely any drinking, not other substances, but after the divorce, she turned into another person completely. So just my experience.

Regardless- **do not cheat**. You will become the villain. Her treatment of your kids will get worse because betrayed partners go throughout hell when cheated on and it fucks up even the most level headed people. It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s levelheaded so you would really be dooming your kids to a new circle of hell. \n\nWith intimacy- take yourself out on dates. Get sex toys. As many as you would like. If your wife isn\u2019t in the place to fulfill your needs and is not open to talking about anything then date yourself. If you\u2019re determined not to divorce then you\u2019re going to need to step up your wooing game *for yourself*. Sleeves, strokers, vibrators, lubes etc etc. It is not perverted to want to be connected with your wife, and if she won\u2019t meet you in the middle then cut her out of the equation. Fuck yourself so good that the happy hormones will alleviate your stress for a few minutes. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you have hobbies. I don\u2019t know if your kids have hobbies. Regardless- sign up for some now. Rediscover what makes you happy in life. Get your kids away from your wife, take them on walks, sign them up for group activities. Invest in their happiness. Don\u2019t be afraid to tell your wife to knock it off when she\u2019s terrorizing them. Show your kids that you are there for them. Never assume that *they* will assume how much you love them. Tell them always, spend time with them, and tell your wife when she\u2019s stepped over the line. \n\nIs it a possibility you two could sleep in two separate rooms? If she wants to treat you like a co-parent, then you should get the benefits of being one. A bed all to yourself, bedding that you love, and a mattress firmness that best suits you. Heck, maybe even get a separate bed to fit in your room you share with her now \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

It might come down to an ultimatum of \"either we go to therapy together, or I leave to save myself\" and if that doesn't show her there is in fact a problem.... The best you can do for yourself and the kids is to move forward without her.\n\nAlso, read the Five Love Languages and 7 Principles that Make Marriage Work. They're both great books that our therapist recommended. My husband doesn't like to read, but every night I would read a chapter to him and we would discuss it. It's amazing to just have the right words to express how you're feeling. For example - my love language is touch, I haven't been touched at all today and I feel my meter draining. Doesn't matter if you just bought me a car, I appreciate that, but I NEED touch to feel loved.\n\nThe books validate your feelings while simultaneously explaining your position to your spouse in a way that doesn't make them feel like they have to just \"believe\" you. A psychologist is saying these things, so it's easier for them to accept it as truth and not you just making a mountain out of a molehill.\n\nGood luck dude",

Also- dude, this life today is hard. We all talk about it in the millennial groups and subs - it\u2019s different than it was before. Having kids is harder bc both parents have to work.

I literally asked my dad, who is VERY chill in comparison, why he was with her (or at least I thought that a lot growing up). I used to tell myself that I will NEVER be my mother when I have a family. (She\u2019s gotten calmer now that all of us have grown up and started our own families).\n\nWhen I became a parent, I started catching myself acting like her - freaking out, dismissing my husband as a shitty parent, being crazy. A lot of it was hormones, and I was raging. Every stupid little thing would make me so insanely angry. \n\nI needed new meds, and honestly pot helped a LOT. I can enjoy my family, rather than trying to control them, and I know we are all a lot happier for it. I obviously don\u2019t know anything about your situation that isn\u2019t laid out here - but before I was a mom, I used pot to help with my libido because my anxiety meds killed my sexuality completely. Now, I use it to relax so I don\u2019t lose my shit constantly - being a mom can be so overstimulating lol, and sometimes you feel like you are on a different level than your husband (not saying at all that you are a problem, because my husband is amazing and I still treated him like a shitty parent). Also - I was getting treated for the wrong mental health stuff, so when I actually got put on the correct medication, I also became a lot less \u2018crazy\u2019 - and my libido came back! (Yay!)\n\nObviously drugs aren\u2019t always the solution, I also see a therapist and a psychiatrist, but it\u2019s what helped me go from crotchety overstimulated mom who eats her husband and kids for breakfast, to a mom who enjoys life a lot more.",

I catch myself being moody/snap at my boyfriend sometimes, and he notices it. A lot of it has to do with, he doesn't help out with anything and I'm exhausted. It sucks the joy out of me, and I am stressed. I ask for help and rarely get it. So I am starting to get fed up. I work full time as does he, but pretty much all of my free time after work is taken up cooking and cleaning and whatever else needs to be done around the house, while he just sits there.\n\nAnd then after all of this, he begs me for sex all day every day. I can be in the middle of doing the dishes or the laundry, or I just want to take a minute to myself and sit down. I just can't even get turned on anymore. It doesn't feel like an equal partnership at this point, and I'm basically just the maid. I am also the type that the more you ask me, the more I don't want to do it. So him begging for sex every day when I'm obviously not in the mood doesn't help. I just have a bit of resentment towards him and I'll probably sound like a piece of shit but sometimes I think \"he doesn't deserve it\" when he doesn't ever lift a finger to help me out. But I need to be his on call bang buddy and I'm the bad guy when I'm in the middle of chores that need to be done but I'm not going to drop everything to go have sex.",

On the flip side, you have to start giving her positive feedback when she does something right, even if it is really small, like waiting for a day that you aren\u2019t fighting to get pictures. Then you can thank her sincerely and tell her that it made you happy that she did that. As long as it is the truth, it will be helpful in the long run. In the short run, her bad behavior will get worse because it used to get a lot of attention. You need to be neutral at best, but if possible, ignoring the behavior is preferred.

You teach your daughters it's okay to be horrible, and your sons that it's ok to be mistreated. Kids grow up to mirror what they see in the home, to recreate what feels normal to them. Alimony and child support would hurt, but you need to get into a healthy realtionship so you can model the behavior you want them to build their lives from.

So it goes both ways. \n\nAs for sex, I have let go of the mean comments that were made during fights about this. Super nasty, soul-breaking stuff. I recognized they were said in anger. While there is some truth in it, not the whole thing was meant. I also say hurtful stuff when I'm angry. Perhaps my spouse means it all, but I choose to believe what seems most likely. I initiate sex 99% of the time. I am okay with it. I need it, so I get it. I can make do without the emotional connection or the actual interest from the other person. I know it's a shit situation but I'm trying to make the best of it. You keep initiating and in time, they will reciprocate...at least once a year. But hey! Take what you can get. Cheating is not a solution. Either make the best of the situation or take the financial hot and leave. I dont want to leave because I actually love my spouse and I scared of not finding another person I'd actually like and who'd choose me in all my crazy. \n\nI do see things getting better between us. \n\n\nThe reason your spouse is shit to you also has something to do with you. You may not be 100% at fault but little things add up. So I give my spouse that grace. It does take 2 to tango. Albeit, one person might be doing most of the dancing. \n\n\nI wish you all the very best. You're not the only one out there. There's some comfort in that.

Whilst a lot of people say that kids can tell the marriage is terrible I think I knew deep down but because I was so used to my parents being absolutely miserable I thought that was normal. So whether they know or don\u2019t, you\u2019re creating an environment that tells them this type of relationship is normal - which is absolutely not. My mum was exactly the same. She\u2019d criticise, speak down to, call names - a plethora of things everyday. The vibes of the house were always based on her moods. She\u2019d never admit anything was wrong because she probably didn\u2019t want to have to face her own issues. Dad eventually locked himself in his office and just worked 80hr weeks to get away from her. I never had a good relationship with him because he was fairly absent when I was a teenager. He eventually started to cheat from when I was about 14 onwards and we all knew but no one said anything. If you\u2019re thinking about it don\u2019t do it, just divorce. In a way I don\u2019t blame my dad for cheating because my mother was so impossible to live with. There was always an issue and it just really grinds you down. I am mad at him for it but I do understand. He just wanted love, affection, companionship and unfortunately he found it outside his marriage. \nTo this day I still walk on eggshells with my mother. She is a completely different person to everyone on the outside and very bitter, irritable, and mean in the home. It actually makes me feel physically sick when she\u2019s nice and happy to others because we never got that at home.\nMy dad left my mum 8 years ago now, mum got the house and we stayed with mum but that doesn\u2019t mean our relationship with dad got worse. My relationship with dad is SO much better now he\u2019s out of that environment, I\u2019d say we have a great friendship.\nDad had to move into a friend house for the first few months of the divorce and then he found his own place. He\u2019s like a new person, he\u2019s happy, relaxed and he has a new gf who\u2019s super loving and kind. \nWith my mum not so much - she still causes me a lot of emotional pain even at 26. She is still very bitter about my father and I cannot mention his name without verbal or emotional repercussions. \n\nIt\u2019s not worth it to stay, you only have one life don\u2019t waste it. Your children will be fine and honestly so much better for it. Be their sounding board like my dad is for me, because you children mostly likely have a difficult time with your wife too - if they do please guide and support them because it can really make or break someone. Also look up narcissistic wife/mother and see if anything there adds up. Because I was gobsmacked at the similarities between my mother, her behaviour and that of a narc mum/wife\n\nAll the best - and do what best for your mental health and kids. I promise you will not regret it.",

            "body": "Been there. Maybe my insight will strike a chord, but I doubt it. My husband had to hear it from another man, a counselor. He asked-are you trying to push your wife away? Because you are. It was as if a lightening bolt had hit him. I\u2019d said the same things, explained as nauseum, but it finally made sense in his mind and gave him clarity. He\u2019s stepped up, shown me that I have a partner-beyond just kids and marriage. Our life is better together now than I ever expected it to be. Once the bitching stops, she\u2019s been done. \n\n\nIf you take on the other half of the stress and worry burden, half of the behavioral management stress-or even just BACKED her fully, without dismissing or undermining her words or attempts-she wouldn\u2019t be cold, resentful, or snapping. \n\nYou aren\u2019t guiding or protecting them. You\u2019re showing them that they don\u2019t need to commit, keep trying, or take accountability. You\u2019re showing them a man makes a family-and stays only because he wants to save money and keep his wife trapped, miserable, and as a full time sitter to kids-that you get a side piece and she can\u2019t find her OWN happy ever after. Because it sure isn\u2019t you. You\u2019re showing them-their wants matter more than their future partner, their future family needs, or their responsibilities. That isn\u2019t safe. That isn\u2019t love. You\u2019re hurting their mom-and spending time chasing ass online and flirting with people who don\u2019t know your baggage. Bc it\u2019s obvious to all readers you already are.\n\n\nShe wouldn\u2019t be alone in one of the hardest parts of parenting, that is rarely mentioned or acknowledged.\nShe wouldn\u2019t snap at \u201cevery little thing\u201d because she would feel like she has a husband and partner, but a resentful teenager contributing to the problems. \n\nIt seems like you\u2019re looking for an excuse to connect with someone else, and have done everything BUT try. Also-based on what you wrote-you clearly are treating her as if you have the option of options-why the hell should she act like you shit rainbows? You\u2019re begging Reddit to feel bad for you and justify your search for someone else while in your marriage. Ok, bud. \n\nIf you think you need to be sneaky and find someone outside of your wife-by all means, make her day-just leave. \n\nShe\u2019d probably feel relieved. Immensely. Don\u2019t waste time investing into another until you end it properly, and are doing your part to be dad at least on your court ordered visits, and paying the amount that is deemed as support. \n\nA new woman won\u2019t be fun or connected with you any more than she will after a while, because once she is saddled with the same bullshit disproportionate expectations and realities, you\u2019ll be in the same sibling ship.\nBUT! It will definitely be easier to prolong if you only see and take some sort of care of your kids two weekends a month. \n\nYour wife would probably love the little 2x monthly 2 day long break. More than she gets now! The stress relief of no longer feeling alone, and constant resentment to a partner-that isn\u2019t a partner-would give her back so much youth, vitality, life, and happiness. It would give her a little time to find a better match well. \n\nThe grass isn\u2019t always greener, but I can promise-someone else will be more than happy to water the lawn you didn\u2019t appreciate, and they\u2019ll come in with a riding mower that makes you suddenly possessive. \n\nLet her go, or try to make an effort.

            "body": "Hey stranger,\n\nI hope you read this.\n\nAs the result of a very unhappy marriage, I can tell you that your kids know. Even if they don\u2019t know now, they will in the future. There is no \u201cif\u201d, there is just \u201cwhen\u201d.  They will resent you both for it. I\u2019m not projecting; I\u2019m speaking from experience of myself and other children who grew up the way that I did and shared the exact same feelings. Part of me loves my dad so much and I knew he felt EXACTLY this way. He even told me a couple of years ago once I turned 25 because he is still with her, desperate, miserable, and had to talk to someone. After a very stormy childhood where my emotional needs were neglected (because my mom neglected the needs of my dad and therefore she also didn\u2019t know how to be there for me emotionally, including herself), once I grew up, I was trying to change their marriage, make it better, teach them \u201chealthy\u201d. Teach her understanding, listening, boundaries, self awareness\u2026. It was EXHAUSTING. In my young adulthood, this cycle between them came to the point where I became a fixer and got myself in really unhappy relationships trying to change them, the relationship, make it better because I couldn\u2019t do that for my parents. I stayed while I was unhappy because their relationship was my primary example growing up. I didn\u2019t experience healthy conflict resolution, teamwork, and compassion between two partners. That, affects me to this day. Very deeply. It happens on such a subconscious level that it\u2019s really difficult to change in your adulthood. I went to therapy (going again after a failed relationship) to work it out\u2026 this exact thing. I wish I could\u2019ve helped my dad, but it\u2019s subconsciously made me respect him less. He stuck around and just took it. That caused me to look for men who weren\u2019t \u201cweak\u201d and demanded respect. You can guess how that played out\u2026 only ended up with assholes until I realized the pattern and decided to change it. Learning to respect him for who he is and not the decisions he makes was hard.\n\nI would almost argue that children who grow up in an unhappy home where they notice overtime (especially in high school) that their parents are miserable, it affects them more than divorced but happy parents. Especially if you have daughters, please consider my experience. I\u2019ve met SO. MANY. GIRLS. who experienced this. It\u2019s heartbreaking to grow up in a marriage like that. Both of my parents are great; they love me so much and they together for me. Putting me through college, etc. then it was too late because it was comfort zone. They didn\u2019t have a lot of people besides each other and were scared to start over. Here I am, typing this to you, with tears in my eyes for a marriage that never was and never will be. As much as I yearn for a lifelong love, I am shitless scared of marriage at the same time because I\u2019m scared of being unhappy and not being able to leave because that\u2019s what they showed me. I can leave; anybody can\u2026 but the thought of it is scary because I didn\u2019t have a healthy example of that working out. \n\nThey would be all jolly outside but inside the home, there was so much resentment, anger, and pain. YOUR KIDS FEEL IT. They\u2019ll know it. Most of all, I resent my mom so much. I love her to death but I still resent her, even after a great therapy journey. I feel sad for her, for my dad, I resent her for not doing better and my dad for constantly being miserable yet choosing to show that you should stay instead out of habit and finances. He came to a point last year where he told me that he doesn\u2019t care about finances anymore and that it\u2019s been so long of this misery he rather have a way out but be broke. \n\nI forgave them. I forgave myself. That doesn\u2019t mean the patterns still don\u2019t exist and the fear isn\u2019t there. It doesn\u2019t mean that heartbroken child who wished for a happier home does not feel that emotional strain on her own life. If you can\u2019t fill your own cup and be there for each other\u2019s emotional needs, you will unavoidably end up neglecting your kids\u2019. You can get them the best toys, best schools, best meals, etc. but none of that is going to make up for unmet emotional needs and growing up around an unhappy marriage.\n\nThis is the first time I\u2019m recommending this on Reddit: I think you should give her an ultimatum because she doesn\u2019t seem to hear you out one bit when you try to say that it\u2019s not working out. You\u2019ve tried to propose a solution (counseling) which she totally dismissed saying that there is no issue (god this is triggering it reminds me of my mom). I know it\u2019s not as easy as that but you have to do this for the sake of you, and if not, your children. As long as you continue have a good relationship with them, they will understand and respect you for it in the future and hell, maybe learn from their parent that they shouldn\u2019t stay in a situation where they\u2019re unhappy. Be that example and inspiration for them\u2026 if not for yourself. \n\nNow\u2026 you\u2019re a stranger. You\u2019re not my dad and your wife is not my mom. You have different kids. However, after writing the longest post I have ever written on Reddit, I so wholeheartedly hope that you think about what I said because I wished back then that my dad cared about himself, my mom, and me enough to be able to have the guts to leave and start over. We all would have been better for it and I wouldn\u2019t be halfway around the world building my own life in an effort to escape the black hole that I didn\u2019t want to get sucked into too.",

Attention you have to focus onnhow she behaves not what she said. Alternatively, again on a neutral tone assert that what she done has hurt your feelings.\n\nIgnore her feelings for the time being as she will revert to tantrums. Again give her definite answers like, we agreed beforehand now I am doing it - we accepted the invitation so Im going, you can stay.\n\nBe fiirm in your boundaries, when discussing plans make sure it is at a acceptable moment, have short and simple questions; \"this Saturday there is a show/bbq/library/pool and it's for such hours until that moment, are you in.\n\nAttention as you don't want her \"ok\" but ask if she is into the activity, she says no, fine state you are going with rhe kiddos. Again don't dictate her time, just plan ask if she is in and do as needed.\n\nShe is going to tantrums and try to kill your plans, so be ready to cancel or go in all cases have a plan B - she flunked the bbq with friends. Fine go to the pool with kiddos..\n\nLastly, believe me you are in no state to engage in an healthy relationship outside at this moment, will be clear you may find companionship but don't make it a thing, you are not a monk but you have to understand that at this moment you need to reeducate her, and for god sake make it an absolute necessity to pass time with your kids. Right now you think it's going to last forever but once they reach adolescence they will make their own life with friends and such.",

One thing I've learned:  I'm like a lot of women in that my desire shuts down under stress,  while my husband starts novelty seeking sexually when he's too stressed.  He's learning not to place demands on me that stress me,  and as a result,  I'm much more able to give him a bit more variety and creativity, especially when things are a bit tougher for him.  It isn't perfect,  but so much better!\n\nYou might also need to step up more in the house, take charge of meals,  or otherwise find ways to have a better partnership.  She may need to let go some control,  communicate better,  manage emotions, or otherwise change how she's doing things.  \n\nYou might possibly be able to salvage this,  and I think you're right in that divorce is not the most desirable outcome.  If counseling is off the table though,  it might actually be better in the long run.  Stress makes it hard to make progress in life - for all of you.

He didn't do much better,  but neither did he fare worse without me.  \n\nIn short:  work the problem.  Together if possible,  but if not,  find more acceptable ways to work it alone.",

My kids would end up with her most of the time, and while I\u2019m sure that sounds like a relief to some, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s here to protect them, to guide them. Leaving would leave them in a situation I can\u2019t stand by and watch. It\u2019s not just as easy as people make it sound.\n\nAssuming you are in the US, you are 100% correct, don't let the bozos in these comments tell you otherwise.  I am speaking from hard-earned experience.  People who grow up in dysfunctional homes might have problems and think divorce would have been better, but they have no idea what they are talking about in 2025. The fallout of divorce and the family court system will destroy a kid's life unless both parents are extremely unselfish and cordial, which usually means they don't have to get divorced in the first place. It is only remotely functional when one parent is a drug addict, flagrant physical abuser, or abstentee deadbeat who won't even show up for court.\n\nIt's common to get on here and project your feelings onto a post, but I can hear in your words, my own words, from 10 years ago.  I *do* understand.\n\nI spent a long time in a marriage where all I wanted was her to *relent*.  Just let up.  Stop making it worse on purpose.  Treat me like a human being instead of furniture in the background of the stage of her life. I just wanted to be treated with the dignity a person would give to a cashier at a gas station.  The person I was married to is incapable of that.  Divorce after 17 years wasn't my idea, and in your case, it'll probably be hers too, as ironic as that is.  She's not happy either, even if this is a life she worked hard to create for herself by her dysfunctional behavior.  If that happens, I have no advice for you, it will be hard.  Your relationship with your children must be like steel-reinforced concrete, and even then you'll be tested and have to prove yourself by sheer suffering and giving it time.  Eventually, kids *do* see it.  But, hopefully you're tough.  I found out how much I could live through and it was far more than I could have anticipated or would have volunteered for.\n\nIf she sticks around, just being difficult for years...I honestly think women grow out of it.  I think 25-40 year old women are throwing away their families over nothing; irrational, disproportionate, dishonest, and delusional reasoning and motivations that will leave them in 15 years desperately struggling to piece together something that remotely resembles what they had when they were 30 and being a brat.\n\nIt's like adolescence.  They hormonally need to calm down, and all their friends and media are bad influences.  Just like you gotta take a criminalized 15 year old and just *hold out* until he gets to 24-28 years old and he will calm down and straighten out, I think this current hysteria that is savaging our generation's childrens' families will pass with age.\n\nYour wife has no idea what she has in you, for later in her life. I know you're not perfect, maybe you're really hard to deal with even. But for older women dating, the bar is in hell.  Women are out here looking for a man who wipes his butt instead of leaving skidmarks on the bedsheets and instead getting a guy who takes a baseball bat to your car when you don't give them money for their rent.\n\nYou're the one who picked this woman, and maybe you screwed up.   You also gave her to your kids to have as the only mother they will ever have, and that's your fault.  I know because it's my fault too.  Maybe we were bamboozled, maybe we didn't have anyone looking out for us when we made these decisions, none of that matters now.  That means it is *our* responsibility to handle and not go whining to some administrator in the government to save us from our decisions; and they won't be there to help you anyways.  Your kids didn't do anything here.  You are right to make decisions *solely* on their best interests.\n\nI hope she grows out of it.  If she doesn't, don't crash out.  Thug it out.  We are men, we can handle it, and it's up to us alone to figure out what to do about how dysfunctional this element of our society has become, because this *will* destroy our civilization.",

But, as much as you think it may ruin you financially, I\u2019d look into how you can mitigate that. Because, your kids are seeing you. Eventually they will internalize what marriage is based on what they see their parents doing. Ask yourself if that is what you want them to go through. Is the example you want to set one that shows them a husband is depressed/deadened in a marriage?",

These should be three separate therapists.\n\nBear with me now.  Next you need to target why each of you is unhappy and work on solving those problems as a team (not you versus her, but you and her versus the problems).  \n\nWe know a lot of your problems here.  What are causing her problems?  Why is she snapping or acting like things are a burden?  Who works what hours?  Who does a majority of the hard childcare (homework, get up for school, drop off and pickup, bedtime, actual care?)  Who does the fun childcare?  (Bath? Playing?) Who makes dinner? Does dishes?  Who does the grocery list and grocery run and puts groceries away?  Who does laundry?  Who does weekly chores versus daily (weekly are like mowing lawn, take out garbage or recycling, etc.)  Do you have pet care?  Who does it?  Who manages kids\u2019 doctors\u2019 appts (making and taking?) Who manages sports, school paperwork, anything like that?  Who is paying the bills (the money going out?  The paperwork sending?)  WHO does general house cleaning?  Cleans the bathroom?  Picks up after the kids?  Vacuums, dusts, wipes shit down, etc? \n\nSit down together, figure out everything that has to be handled every day/ week/ month, and how much you each are doing.  What does each of your daily stress look like?  How full are your days?  Do you need help like a weekly or biweekly person to come in and help with the cleaning in XYZ area? \n\nWhat do you each do to show each other appreciation or love?  What do you each need to feel appreciated or loved?  What sort of intimacy do you need?  What does she need? (just sex?  Talking for connection?  Physical touch like cuddling?  Date nights?)  Figure out when and where you can work this stuff in.  Is this talking in the car, or over dinner?  A once a week sitter to go on dates?  More cuddling on the couch with a movie to work up to romance later? \n\nYou need to look for what is the root cause of each of your issues, where you can support each other more, how you can lighten each other\u2019s loads (so she can do more for you and you more for her!), each do what your strengths are in and get help where you struggle and get frustrated easily, etc.\n\nTherapy will be helpful for this, both individual and marriage.  \n\nSimply wishing for change won\u2019t make it happen.  Wishing she\u2019s more emotionally available, magically more patient, more warm, doling out sex with no connection first, etc won\u2019t make it happen.\n\nCheating may get you a quick fix of sex, but it won\u2019t fix your problems, and the same sorts of problems will exist in any marriage, maybe who has them will shift, or which exact problems, but you\u2019d have problems with anyone else.  They may not seem to exist in an affair (where your AP has no major extra marriage and kids responsibilities and no extra stress), but know that if you were a real couple those same problems would come rushing back. \n\nIf you divorced, you\u2019d have all the added stress of doing everything solo.  \n\nYou need to work through the problems you have.  As a team.  It can get better if you both put the work in.",

If your partner is the type to make everything about them... even ***your*** mental health struggles, you should leave. It sounds stupid and impossible right now and you're asking yourself questions like \"how am I going to afford to live on my own\" or \"how much is child support going to be\" or \"will she ruin the kids if I am not there to counteract her ideas\", etc... but these are excuses for you not to take action for ***yourself***.\n\n  \nIf you have truly communicated these things to her and nothing is changing or will change, you just have to leave. Your life as a person and as a dad will not get better and it will affect your kids in the worst ways possible. After you leave, you will make money and you will make ends meet. Even if your wife raises the kids in a way that is less than desirable, people don't typically die at 18. They will be adults one day and you can have a relationship with them that is based on nuance and context and not just \"what mom said\". It will take time, but that process will be made easier if you have been and are taking care of yourself.\n\n\n\nI struggled making the decision to leave for a long time due to chronic depression and then suddenly it was made for me. It changed my life and I have never been happier, despite my initial disposition to \"having to leave my family\". I put some distance between myself and an army of people who supported a hypocritically codependent lifestyle and as a result I have more time, energy, and money to do the things I want to do. I even got a passport and am going on a real vacation!\n\n  \nThrough all of what has happened and all that is still to happen to you, remember that **you are a person too**. Nobody will ever have to deal with you as much as you do. **So take care of yourself**. Wife and kids aside, you have to take care of yourself to take care of *any* of them. Even if that ends up just being the kids. If that means leaving your wife and co-parenting, then that is what it means. No more and no less.\n\n  \nYou take the knowledge of life and carry it forward into the next great adventure, wherever and whoever that is. You deserve that.",

You're not a bad person because of this, but you're also trapped in the myopia of having stuck to a path and not wanting to admit it's wholly the wrong one.\n\nYou are not protecting your children now. You are hurting them more than helping them.\n\nChildren learn and model their relationships based on the relationships they're surrounded by.\n\nRegardless of how much you may try to protect your children from the worst of your wife's moods, and hide your own upset and hurt from them, they will see it and inherit it. They may be too young to verbalise it yet, but you are shaping their entire lives now.\n\nI don't know what gender your children are, but you're teaching them that it's okay for one partner to be unreasonable, picky, hateful but to pretend that everything's okay as long as you force a Christmas sweater over it and take nice family pictures once a year. \n\nYou're teaching them that the other partner should do everything to force down their needs, their desires, their wants and go unfulfilled in life because that's just how it is.\n\nAnd if you step out, you'll be teaching them that's how to \"solve\" these problems.\n\nI'll be honest too, despite how much you put on a smile for the kids they will see those cracks. They'll see your face fall as they turn away, hear the sigh as your wife demands something unreasonable, feel the chill in the room as they walk in right after you two have had a spat and have just snapped your mouths shut as you hear them coming. Children are much more perceptive than people give them credit for.\n\nIf you cheat and she finds out, will she stay with you? I find that highly unlikely given the state of things. You'll still be financially ruined at that point. It might not be today, it might not be for a few years, but it will happen.\n\nSo what's the better choice? Start making plans now? Get out of the marriage, start sorting out custody and child support and living arrangements and work and get yourself back on your feet now?

Ironically playing around and asking difficult questions about our marriage and my wife's personality characteristics on one of those AI models led to a discovery for me. A lot of my wife's behavior seemed to be coming from being incredibly entitled and inconsiderate. I came to learn that a lot of her behavior fit within the definition of over-functioning and that generally over-functioning manifests out of an excessive feeling of hyper-responsibilty. To the people on the outside it seems like they are entitled, controlling, and inconsiderate but on the inside they aren't able to let go and leave it up to others. The difference felt like realizing the person that you thought was a jerk and trying to fight you really has PTSD and doesn't understand that they're causing the issues because they are reliving their trauma. She may not be able to let herself relax and experience her emotions without a good therapist.",

You should never be treated like a child for wanting to experience love.

I don't think It is something that can be better overnight but this problem didn't happen overnight either. She has so many walls up and it seems like the way you are showing affection and trying to reconnect isn't the way to break down those barriers. You seem quite bitter that she has become this way and responds that way and I am sure she is the same way. If I were you I would do some research on breaking through resentment barriers in your relationship and start behaving in that way regardless of her reaction. Give it 1 year. 1 year of doing only the things recommended to break through bitterness and no matter what she does you still behave in that way. Let her melt the anger away slowly until she can meet you in the loving way you have been meeting her for that 1 year and she can finally actually talk and connect and ask for what she needs in order for you to get what you need from her.  In the grand scheme of an entire marriage it is no time at all and will potentially save your life and your love. Give it a try. I have hope for your situation because I know at one point you said yes to her and she said yes to you. That's the only truth you need at the moment.",

            "body": "I am not advocating leaving. I guess I'm different like that. My first suggestion of course is counseling either by yourself and or with your spouse. You can't change her so you should be working on yourself. And as you return to yourself, pre- marriage or pre-children you may find that she is more attracted to you because that's who she married. \nTalking to her doesn't help. So don't talk to her about your issues, she'll have to bring them up. Which leads to My next suggestions which women will hate and I will be downloaded. \nI'm a bit more Petty so this next suggestion may be helpful or may not be, but she seems content and unaware of who and what she's become. She could also be lazy and not want to change. That's all good. You can withdraw from the relationship what you give her that she needs. It sounds retaliatory but I view it as an equalization. She's taken what you need and depend upon her for physical and emotional connection, but you probably haven't withdrawn anything from her in emotional or physical or mental support. As an example, my wife needs to talk about her day, when we were going through a hard time. I would not ask her about her day. She just had to keep it to herself. You need to find that sweet spot to withdraw and let her feel what you are feeling. She will need to start the conversation to re-engage you as her support person, You cannot bring it up. But you can use it as leverage to get what you need.\nSomething else that I found that works is to create rules in the house. Women love to make rules and we Men just follow them. Start making rules about random things like which way the toilet paper roll should sit. She wants the toilet seat down but you want the toilet lid down. Food labels should always be facing outward in the cabinet or the refrigerator. Set the rule and demand she follow it. \nI was also thinking about your dinner issue. Eating the same things over and over. On the way home stop off and eat out. And when you come home you won't be hungry. You could just take it for lunch the next day or don't eat it at all. You could just say you're not hungry. Or you can make your own food that night, just some eggs or something and just say you don't want to eat that food again. Don't worry so much about her feelings, she's not worried about yours is she? \nI think intimacy should be a once to twice a week event for a married couple with children. The constant rejection is painful. Back in the day I would ask for intimacy between 3 and 4 days in a row and if I was rejected on the fourth day I would stop talking to the wife. I wouldn't ask for intimacy after that but I wouldn't talk to her either. That doesn't mean I didn't talk to her about things we needed to discuss. If a kid needed to go to the doctor or bills that we needed to pay. It was clear that I was upset about something because I wasn't talking to her and I wouldn't re-engage until after we were intimate. She did always have the same response that she didn't want to be intimate with her husband. If he wasn't talking to her but, she would ignore The request for intimacy. When I was talking to her. She missed her window so now she had to be intimate in an uncomfortable situation from her point of view. And it's not like she didn't see this coming. This went on for years. She was just too lazy to realize what was going on but knew it was a recurring problem because it would happen at least once a month. \n\nGood luck and I hope you work through it",

This can affect her whole personality and everything you\u2019ve described actually makes me think this is a possibility that needs to be explored. If not this it wouldnt hurt to ask her what her if her health is ok. You may get pushed off but you know her and you can tell when someone is not okay. \nOn another front, be prepared to put in a whole lot of unreciprocated love and affection and support to her. Give yourself a year, and pour into her absolutely everything you need and want, give to her with NO expectations of anything being returned/reciprocated, if she doesn\u2019t like touch tell her how beautiful she is, complement her meals and say thank you for absolutely everything single thing she does that remotely could be for you or the kids. Greet her in the morning with a kiss and tell her how much you love her. Go all in for 365 days. Give it absolutely 1000%. Do this and in one year come back to me and tell me how you went.

You wonder if they realized how annoying/rude/loud/arrogant/cold/stupid--whatever word (fill in the blank)--their spouse would turn out to be, and how could they possibly still be in love. My heart goes out to so many people who seem like dear wonderful people and yet married to a spouse who seems utterly horrid and oblivious to the misery of their spouse and family. I really think people notice. I don't think anyone can effectively hide behind the Christmas cards and Facebook postings. So whatever happy face you put on, folks, at least some, probably know more than you realize and silently sympathize with you. That includes your kids. I don't blame you a bit for staying the course for their sakes. I don't know how old they are, but don't be surprised if one day they say, \"God, Dad, how can you stand it?\" In the meantime, I guess you can try to set a good example for them and guide them away from those unfortunate attributes of your wife. Time passes faster than you realize. Formulate a game plan that will give you something to look forward to down the line. This old woman wishes you every good thing.",

Like when did she stop wanting intimacy and connecting with you? \n\nTalk to her. Suggest couples therapy. Give her an ultimatum. But, if she is like my partner and is just a miserable abusive fuck then leave and fight for your kids.\n\nYour kids don't deserve to be cut down by their mom and being in an emotionally healthy environment 2-5 days a week is better than being in a toxic one 24/7",

Then, if you see no change in her, (not counting on it) explain that the criticisms, complaints and negativity are getting to you all. You\u2019d like her to work on saying kind things to you and to the children because we all need that: And before each time she asks anyone else to improve, she needs to make sure she\u2019s said at least three positive things to you or that child within the last 24 hours. They shouldn\u2019t be stacked together as permission to complain but should be built into her day so any time she needs to correct, the positive input has already been occurring regularly. This will really benefit her kids, but obviously you as well. \n\nYou\u2019re right that your kids will be best trained and cared for by you, which can\u2019t happen if you barely see them.

He said it was very obvious and it affected the way he views relationships as an adult. To this day he says he would have rather grew up in a shoe joc apartment with his dad than in a nice home with two miserable parents. He\u2019s almost 35 and still has relationship issues. Therapy is helping tho. \n\nA co worker of mine finally asked for a divorce after being married for over 10 years. He\u2019s working overtime like a slave and just recently rented out a half decent apartment for himself. Even with the insane workload and still being broke all the time he looks like he has aged in reverse. We have taken him out with us and obviously pay for him when we do and I\u2019ve never seen someone smile so much. Dating is easy for him since he\u2019s a very fit guy in his 40\u2019s but looks like he\u2019s 30. \n\nJust saying it\u2019ll be hard for a bit but you\u2019ll realize it paid off once everyone\u2019s happier.",

You deserve to have the things you\u2019re asking for in this post. You deserve to have intimacy, affection, and peace. \n\nShe also deserves those things. Oftentimes, the short attitude and lack of effort are signs of severe depression. She\u2019s trying not to show the world a put together family, she\u2019s trying to convince you and your kids that SHE is the one who is put together. She\u2019s trying to prove she isn\u2019t crumbling on the inside, exhausted, overstimulated, and depressed. \n\nIs her being depressed an excuse? No. I\u2019m not saying you should buck up and take it because she is in the same boat or worse. What I\u2019m saying is that it is easy to say \u201cI am sad and this is what the other person can do to fix it\u201d. Instead, what can you do to fix it? If you want adventurous meals at home, find some recipes and make it a family activity to make the meal together. It brings play, platonic intimacy, and relieves the mental and physical load on everyone. If you want intimacy, strike up a deep and intimate conversation with your wife and pay attention, be involved, ask probing questions (women often need hours of intimate but nonsexual interaction before they feel like having sexual intimacy). Find ways to introduce playfulness and platonic intimacy into every aspect of your lives, and while it might take a while, she will start reciprocating.",

            "body": "Can I ask if things were always like this with your wife? Did these issues start after having kids? I'm asking because I'm wondering about post partum depression that was never treated. I was just listening to someone describe their symptoms and experiences with it last night, and so much of what you said about your wife fits exactly how this person was acting- trying to present a perfect family but, inside, completely detached and unable to care about her kids or husband. She also was too ashamed to share with her husband, thinking she should just be stronger. It's just a thought that popped in my head\n\nNow, if this has simply always been her personality, then I would say to see if you can get her to at least try marriage counseling. Maybe an outside perspective would be helpful (actually, if she's struggling with her mental health it could be helpful as well). It doesn't sound like you're completely ready to give up on your marriage, you just want things to improve. I hope she does too. \n\nAlso, I think it was extremely brave of you to share so openly. I appreciated the way you explained your feelings so clearly. I don't think you're ANY of the things that you worried people might accuse you of being. It sounds like you love your wife and desperately want to feel connected to her emotionally and physically again. I think that's completely normal. Our spouse is supposed to be our partner in all things, and it's REALLY difficult to feel like that \"us against the world\" feeling is going away, that you're now at odds with each other (I experienced it, but I certainly don't have all the answers as my husband ended up dying suddenly while things weren't good between us). You've gotten a lot of advice, so I don't want to rehash it all. I want to wish you (and your wife and kids) all the best, though. You sound like a loving partner and parent, so I assume your marriage was good at one point. I really hope you find your way back to that place. I also agree that advice to \"just leave\" is a massive oversimplification of life. It's not that simple. I also think it's not abnormal for marriage to be really, really hard at points. However, it does take both people to fight and work at improving things. I hope you can have some honest conversations with your wife where she truly HEARS you. \ud83d\udc9c",

I was afraid of the same things you're afraid of - money, custody, was it even possible to have a future where I could be truly happy.  \n\nStart out with telling your wife that if she isn't willing to do her part to turn things around, you can't stay in the marriage.  Is she willing to go to couples therapy? Make it very clear to her that if she doesn't change, that's her choice.  But you ARE going to change because you want a better life than what you have now.  Start small - such as making something new for dinner that you and your kids want to eat. And tell her that she can order takeout or make herself a bowl of cereal if she doesn't want to eat it.  And then stick to that.  If you start changing, she will change.  She'll be forced to.  But be prepared that she may get worse.  \n\nYou either stay in a loveless and dissatisfying marriage where NONE of you are happy or you start getting the help you need to build a new life.

I understand you're frustrated and you're not feeling good about the relationship but not once have you said anything good or nice about her. Why do you stay? Money is not a good enough reason. Why would she want to be intimate and passionate with someone who's threatened divorce \"hundreds of times\" and called her names? People who are depressed are abused by the depression. It tells them \"nothing is wrong\" one second and then drains everything from them. She sounds depressed or going through something hormonal. Or maybe she just feels the vibes you're posting online. I'm very happily married and satisfied with the marriage and we have sex once a week due to work and just being exhausted responsible adults. \n\nListen to yourself. You're trying to justify cheating and it sounds like you may already be emotionally cheating. \n\nEither leave or get counseling to help yourself. Idk dude.... You can only change yourself and you can't make people do things. Learn to be happy with yourself first, by yourself. Constantly dredging in the mud of what she is or isn't doing isn't helping you. Especially if you don't want to get a divorce. Edit: that depression comment I made applies to yourself as well. It can skew everything. There are villains in marriages, but sometimes depression and anxiety can make *everyone* the villain. Two people who are depressed in a relationship is a bomb waiting to go off.

Leaving would leave them in a situation I can\u2019t stand by and watch. It\u2019s not just as easy as people make it sound.\n\nI have like 8 years until my youngest is out of HS. I can't imagine leaving before then, because things are going to be much worse for THEM if I leave and they are stuck with her. I have to be the meat shield that blocks all her negativity and anxiety and moodiness to keep it from messing up their childhood. After that, I'm gone. I honestly don't even care if I get a divorce. I will never date again and I'm not interested in looking for another partner, I just want to be left alone to be happy on my own.\n\nI wish I could give you some advice on how to get out of it, but I don't have any. Like you, I've thought through the options and leaving might be best for you (or me), it's not best for the kids and frankly, if I were my kids, I'd be real mad at me for leaving them alone with her 50% of the time at best.\n\nIf you need to talk to someone, I'm in the exact same boat, feel free to hit me up on DM.",

Things will be 10 times worse if you cheat, so I hope you don\u2019t plan to do that. I read that you\u2019d be financially ruined if you were to divorce her, but what other choice do you have if you\u2019re in a dead marriage with an unwilling partner? Wait for her to divorce you? Because I guarantee it\u2019s coming from the sound of it,. As a child of divorced parents, I guarantee you, my childhood would\u2019ve been 10 times worse if they stayed together. Children know when their parents are not happy and it is not healthy for them. And children don\u2019t have to stay with their mom, that\u2019s usually the de facto situation but if you can prove that they\u2019d be better off with you, then do that. I suggest individual therapy OP. This will help you sift through  your emotions and help you make the best decision for you and your children.",

If you have a safe place to journal everything then start doing that. When the kids are old enough for you to leave your journal will be your side for them to see as she will surely try to make you out to be the villain. Try to set up an account in your name only and save as much as you can. Every cent, no matter how small the deposit. Try to find a hobby or something you enjoy to help you disconnect and have some peace. There\u2019s great online counseling services that will work around your finances and schedule even if it\u2019s just for yourself. I know all of this sounds overly simplistic and it will still suck at times but knowing you will get out eventually is a great goal and give you hope. You can also tell her you are done and only staying for the kids. If you have an extra bedroom move in to it. She probably enjoys stringing you along and likes to make you feel like maybe she\u2019s \u201cin the mood\u201d to just yank that away. Don\u2019t let her have any more power than you have to. There\u2019s a life out there for you with a woman who loves you. I understand worrying about money but life is too short to be so unhappy. There\u2019s really nice manufactured homes or small condominiums. Ultimately she will probably try to drop the children off to you often just to keep you from being able to date. Do not let her know she can use the kids to hurt you. I\u2019m really sorry you are going through this! Find a powerhouse attorney to at least know your options.",

He and my sis are still together w kids in college, just as miserable as ever, I assume since I haven't spoken to that bitch since 2016 haha. Yup my own sister. I feel bad for my BIL but he could leave at this point. Growing up my sis was the Golden Child and both of our parents were narcissists. Maybe that has something to do w my sis, I know she has narcissistic tendencies. In 2016 while walking on a quiet beach at sunset my sis tells me, I ruined her childhood b/c I was always getting the crap beat out of me by our parents (for no reason, thou sometimes due to her lies) and that created stress for her! \ud83d\ude04 That same trip she apparently knew our family carried a gene for breat & ovarian cancer (BRCA1+) and didn't tell me she got tested and scheduled her surgery. I eventually heard from the testing co since I am a direct relative. This was the last straw for me. \n\nShe has been a nasty witch ever since the kids became toddlers. She picks fights w the twins, her husband, even w me while we were on spring break w them in 2016! For the kids birthday we would fly up on a 4 day weekend ea year and be stuck listening to her bitching & fighting all day & night. We started to hate even going b/c it stressed us out, made us crabby and ruined a long weekend for us. She was like that even in front of guests!! She was sooo loud 2 of their neighbors moved away from them! \n\nYour kids are no doubt suffering too! I used to be very close w my niece, we talked or snapped everyday till she went to college. Growing up they went on 2 big trips a year and spring break on the a beach in FL. The kids started hating the trips even though they were major locations like Yosemite, Hawaii, NYC, Grand Canyon etc. She would immediately start picking fights and then if anyone got smart or snapped back, everyone got the silent treatment for days at a time!! Onetime when the kids were in middle school they were driving down to FL to meet up w me & husband over spring break. My sis had BIL book a hotel outside Atlanta for an overnight stop. Unfortunately BIL booked wrong weekend, no doubt due to his mental exhaustion, but my sis was on the ph w me having me looking online while she is screaming at BIL at the top of her lungs, inside a mini van. And my niece was texting me how awful it was already on Day 1 of vacation week. \n\nJust imagine this is your life in 10 yrs but it has only gotten worse b/c everyone has been walking on eggshells for all these yrs, giving all the power to the bully in the family. For the sake of your kids, get a divorce w the kids most of the time. Your spouse needs help.",

Do you have a friend or family member you can stay with for a little while? Therapy for you would be good, but I also think you need some time away and she needs to see how serious you are. Your kids will be fine and you can pick them up and take them out every evening if you want.   \n  \nI would like to mention that your wife was my mom. I hurt for my dad as I was growing up.

Honestly cheating is not the solution, but  to be surprised anybody would think about that is crazy. Someone who is touch starved and has been neglected, or treated just like a roommate or the paycheck, its not surprising they would go there. How  cutting them off emotionally, physically, sexually, any of those ways is not viewed as causing the same amount of harm is mind boggling . You married them and when you said i do i promise you were doing all of that, other wise why would they marry you. Then they are contractually blinded to you and you change the whole deal? How is that any less harmful? I don\u2019t understand how know one gets this. I have friends that have been so beaten down by marriages like this that when they finally leave they are forever scared.
