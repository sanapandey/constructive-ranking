I\u2019ve documented everything\u2014photos of her in the same clothes for days, unbathed, medical reports proving her health issues were ignored. But no matter how much proof I have, the system still won\u2019t hold my ex accountable.\n\nI\u2019ve followed every court order, taken every co-parenting class, even sat through mediation where my ex lied through their teeth. I\u2019ve done everything \u201cright.\u201d But it doesn\u2019t matter, because the family court system isn\u2019t about what\u2019s best for the child\u2014it\u2019s about maintaining a false sense of \u201cfairness.\u201d\n\nMy ex has:\nCancelled my daughter\u2019s doctor\u2019s appointments without telling me\nIgnored court orders & manipulated schedules\nCoached my child to say things like \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to Daddy\u2019s\u201d\nSent manipulative messages, twisting reality to make me the \u201cproblem\u201d\nWeaponized CPS and the courts against me with false reports\n\nAnd yet, I\u2019m the one constantly walking on eggshells, afraid that if I push too hard, the courts will somehow turn it against me.\n\nI don\u2019t care about \u201cwinning.\u201d I just want my daughter to be safe, clean, and loved. But the system keeps enabling neglect because it refuses to enforce real consequences.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this because I know I\u2019m not alone. So many parents are fighting this same battle, screaming into a void while judges keep handing our kids back to people who don\u2019t deserve custody.\n\nHas anyone actually made it out of this? How do you get the courts to actually care?",

So I would really encourage to teach her proper anatomical terms for her body parts and for boy parts. I hate to even say that, but this will help to ensure nothing gets miscommunicated if anything nefarious does happen. I truly hope that someone actually listens to you before something really bad happens to your daughter. I will say it is so nice to see that she has you.",
