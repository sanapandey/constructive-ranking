    "selftext": "my friend 27(F) started dating a guy 19(M) who is our friends 33(M) sons best friend. (there son is 17 and had him highschool at 16) On top of this she is still legally married to her ex husband 29(M) who she was with with 7 years, married in late 2022 separated in early 2024. \n\nIt\u2019s really bothered me as he just turned 19 recently and back in October 2024 he had mentioned she has been texting him to me and my bf (both of us are 27) while at a cookout at the 33M friends house. The at the time 18 year old was showing us her telling him how great he is and many compliments while also trauma dumping about her ex husband. On the way home me and my bf discussed how weird that is. \n\nwhat\u2019s even weirder is she kinda in a way watched this boy grow up. He\u2019s been best friends with our friends son since there were children. She had been friends with 33M friend since 2017-18 ish as his younger brother 29M is friends with her ex husband. So she\u2019s known her bf since he was around 11 years old if my math is right \u2026. this just makes me very uncomfortable. \n\ni don\u2019t see what they could possibly have in common. She posted there relationship status at the beginning of March. She is in the medical field with a degree and takes him to his job at Mcdonald\u2019s. Because he doesn\u2019t have a car or license yet. To further show the maturity and different spots they are in life\u2026 \n\nThen he told us this past weekend how she \u201cmade him delete social media\u201d and he\u2019s moving in with her (she has her own apartment) \n\nIt\u2019s obviously a toxic relationship. She is being a groomer. Idk what to do other than complain on here to get it off my best and distance from her as a friend. Because all our other friends have tip-toed around the obvious discomfort we all over of the situation. \n\ni would like to add too that she looks older than her age. she looks mid 30\u2019s and he looks like a teen out with his mom it\u2019s just a lot for me to process because i see my friend of years so differently now ",

I'm the same age and all I can see them now is a bunch of children. Not infantalizing them, I meant that they're teenagers, period. They have a lot of growing up and their brains aren't fully developed. This is creepy behavior, and especially disgusting considering she watched him grow up.",

Did you tell him that making him delete social media is controlling and their relationship can easily turn abusive (if it isn't already)? How do his parents feel about it, do they know? If not, can you tell them? Do they have influence over him?\n\nYour friend is indeed a groomer. If he's at the point where he's moving in with her, he has likely been thoroughly groomed already and is blind to the toxicity. You need to make sure he doesn't get alienated from you.  \nDefinitely talk to your friends about it, if possible let them talk to her about how fucked what she's doing is (best if he's also there and listens) but not mention it yourself. Instead, say nothing and don't distance yourself from her, but try and gain the boys trust. Don't speak against her outright (because then she will try and alienate you from him and he might distance himself) but try and plant small seeds of doubt in him. That's the easiest when asking him questions that are worded in a way to make the toxicity obvious, but let him come to that conclusion himself. That has the highest likelihood of getting him out as soon as possible.\n\nDO NOT sit by and do nothing. That boy needs you.\n\nEdit: Just realized it's not your sons best friend but your friends sons best friend. In that case, ask your friend (the parent of the son) to be the safe space etc, and take the role of calling out your groomer friend in front of the boy and then distancing yourself.",
