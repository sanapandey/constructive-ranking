    "selftext": "I\u2019m a 27-year-old man. I won\u2019t share more personal details than that as I know some people will have strong reactions to what I\u2019m about to say. However, I hope this post reaches those who understand, those who may have gone through something similar and those who need to hear it. Don\u2019t know if I hope to find empathy as in my experience with this story that\u2019s not too common but it would certainly be nice to find some. \n\nAlmost ten years ago, when I was barely an adult I met someone through a dating app. I don\u2019t remember exactly how old I was\u2026 17, 18, 19? I\u2019ve spent years trying to block it out. But I remember how I felt back then. I remember that night like I\u2019m still there. I wish I didn\u2019t. \n\nI had just lost a lot of weight and, for the first time in my life, I was allowing myself to feel desirable, handsome, attractive. Or at least I was trying to. In reality, I didn\u2019t believe I was attractive\u2026 I needed others to believe it for me. Dating apps became my way of proving that I was wanted. I went out with women I wasn\u2019t even that into, not because of them but because I needed to prove something to myself. And maybe it\u2019s just irony \u2014or karma\u2014 that eventually, I got used too.\n\nGrowing up, I was never the guy people found attractive. I was called \u201ctoo dark,\u201d \u201ctoo fat,\u201d \u201ctoo ugly,\u201d both by strangers and sometimes by people who later became my partners too. It shaped the way I saw myself. So when I matched with a profile that wasn\u2019t verified and had just two blurry photos, I ignored the red flags. Because by then, I had already met other women with sketchy profiles and each time, I told myself it had been \u201cfine.\u201d\n\nThis time, it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe date was simple\u2026 what you would call a \u201csex date\u201d. We\u2019d meet, we\u2019d have sex and then never talk to each other again. In theory, this woman was supposed to be almost 10 years older than me, I liked that. I had done this before. Maybe not with someone this age but I was sure that it would be just like any other time.  \n\nFirst major red flag occurred when I was outside her apartment. I was sitting in my car, it was late at night and \u201cshe\u201d asked me to masturbate before I even went up to her place. \u201cShe\u201d wanted to make sure I was hard enough by the time I got there. In my mind, this wasn\u2019t too bad, maybe it was even exciting. By that time we were talking over another messaging app other than Tinder and \u201cshe\u201d had no profile pic\u2026 another red flag I ignored. The biggest red flag tho? At one point \u201cshe\u201d called me\u2026 when \u201cshe\u201d did, I was able to see a pic that seemed to be a profile pic. My guess is this person never added me to avoid me looking at their profile pic, they never thought I would be able to see their profile pic when they called, it was the picture of a guy\u2026 not much older than me by the looks of it. In the call, \u201cshe\u201d didn\u2019t say much but instead let me do the talking and barely replied with suggestive \u201cmmhm\u2019s\u201d and other expressions in what is now clear to me was a fake, high-pitched voice. At the time tho? I was rationalizing everything. Don\u2019t know if it was because I was a kid, I was horny and extremely insecure or a mix of everything. \n\n\u201cShe\u201d asked me to come up to her apartment and this was a \u201cfancy\u201d building so I even had to go through security. I don\u2019t remember their expression when I told them the name of the person I came to see but I can only imagine how disconcerted they must have been. Still, they called to this person\u2019s apartment and I was allowed upstairs. Once there, \u201cshe\u201d asked me to masturbate outside her apartment and make sure I was hard by the time she opened her door. Once again, in my mind, it seemed like just the most exciting encounter I had had by then. \n\nEventually, \u201cshe\u201d opened the door and guided me to the couch. \u201cShe\u201d got on all fours, and as we had agreed prior to this, we had anal sex. I didn\u2019t realize right away, even if something didn\u2019t feel quite right\u2026 but at one point I wanted to reach and masturbate \u201cher\u201d with my hand. When I tried, it dawned on me\u2026 I finally couldn\u2019t keep ignoring the fact that he was wearing a hair wig, when I reached, he immediately removed my hand and I\u2019m sure he thought I wouldn\u2019t have been able to feel anything, but I was. I knew it then, I was having sex with a man. \n\nI wanted to stop. Every fiber in my body was screaming for me to stop and run out of that place. I couldn\u2019t. I can\u2019t explain it and I\u2019m sure most people will just come to the conclusion that I just \u201cwanted it\u201d or whatever. I didn\u2019t. I froze mentally and I couldn\u2019t think straight. I kept going until I ejaculated. Then, without saying anything else, I got dressed and got out of there. Immediately sent him a message telling him I realized what had happened and that it was not okay to do that. I blocked his number, deleted him and never talked about it again. \n\nThe next day or some days after I went to therapy with my long time psychiatrist/psychotherapist\u2026 he didn\u2019t let me off the hook regarding my own responsibility in the matter but he confirmed that what I\u2019d gone through was sexual abuse. I didn\u2019t tell anyone about it until some years later when I decided I\u2019d tell my best friend and thankfully she was sensitive enough and loved me enough to tell me I didn\u2019t deserve that and to say that I was abused. For years, they were the only 2 people who knew. \n\nAbout a year ago, I was dating a girl that \u2013like many others before\u2013 decided to question whether I was maybe bisexual and insisted on it. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m straight and have never felt any attraction for men. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I have nothing against other sexual identities\u2026 but it\u2019s fucking annoying when people decide that just because I may not fully align with their ideals of what \u201cmasculinity\u201d or \u201cstraightness\u201d (whatever the fuck that is) looks like, I have to be something else. And it\u2019s even more frustrating when after telling them I\u2019m not, they keep insisting on it. So, I told her why it was not a joke for me and why it was a serious topic for me. It had been years since my story so I thought I was ready for it. I told her my abuse story\u2026 she told me that \u201cmaybe you wanted it\u201d\u2026 fuck that. \n\nRecently, a girl I was in a situationship with for over a year decided to make jokes about me being sure about whether I am straight or not or if there\u2019s a bi side to me. I told her (like I had told her before) that no, I\u2019m not bisexual and left it at that. This time it cut deeper tho, so I thought it was safe to tell her my story. I didn\u2019t even tell her the entire story. Left it at \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it but that question is not funny for me, I was sexually abused once and I still deal with the consequences of it\u201d. Her reply? She laughed and said \u201cWhat?! You really take everything too seriously\u201d. \n\nSince that happened, I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about what happened to me. I felt dismissed and I felt like an idiot for trusting that anyone would even understand. My sister, one of the most fervent feminists I know of, once said that \u201csexual fraud isn\u2019t real\u201d on a totally separate conversation so, of course I\u2019ve never felt safe enough to tell my family\u2026 all women who I deeply admire and are my role models in life. My dad is out of the picture. \n\nI\u2019ll finish this with an excerpt from a Yale Law & Policy article: \u201cWhen people lie to obtain money, we call it theft.\u00a0When they lie to enter private property, we call it trespass.\u00a0When they lie to obtain sex .\u00a0.\u00a0. we have no idea what to call it\u201d \n\nI know how to call it\u2026 it\u2019s abuse. And it\u2019s fucking mind-bending that we treat our property and our money with more respect than our bodies. \n\nHope this reaches whoever needs it. If you went through something similar: you were abused, you have the right to feel fucking bad about it, and there are others who understand you. All my love.",

That's it, there's no need of penetration to be involved... But in OP's case, it was involved (he mentioned they had anal sex).\n\nOP consented to have sex with a *cis* woman, and the other girl *deceived* him. He realized he was having sex with a trans woman who was older than him. Why the fuck was she seeing teenagers anyway? I know 18 and 19 year olds are legally adults, but they're biologically teenagers lmao. You care so much about being an ally that you're defending a CREEP that is not going to read how you're defending her like a knight saving their damsel in distress.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with having preferences!

Hopefully you can find peace within yourself about these issues & grow strong enough to ignore peoples opinions on your life. & maybe one day you\u2019ll meet someone who doesn\u2019t joke about your sexuality or joke about anything you\u2019ve voiced sensitivity to.",

KianaViFemboy and Kim Petras (famous trans singer) for example both turn on the straight half of my bi self without raising the smallest queer flag. But if that were OP's antagonist's case I don't think they'd have to put up smoke screens with fake/blurry profile pics. \n\nAlso even the cutest passingest femboy shows scrotum skin on the taint when the butthole comes out. Maybe with a perfect coincidence of skillful tucking, dim lighting, undergarment coverage, and teenage lust brain, the scrote could go unnoticed. But that ignores a lot of flags raised by the profile sketchiness, the mismatched profile, the security guard giving pause, etc. \n\nWhat I say next, I say as someone who as a younger lad has had poor judgment from the same motivators OP describes, walked past red flags, and who has as a result been catfished and taken advantage of in humiliating/violating ways. No one detail in this story is a smoking gun that OP is a liar. But taken in aggregate, I smell gun smoke. OP, if I'm wrong and this really happened to you, I'm sorry,  and it was definitely a form of fraud and a form of rape. But I don't think this happened to you. I think you're trying to sell a narrative that gay and/or trans people are predators and that women are callous bitches. I think you're either willing to embellish,  tweak, or outright fabricate stories to sell that narrative. \n\nIf I'm right,  I really hope you go to therapy and examine what had to go wrong in your life to motivate you to manufacture public hatred and outrage for internet points.

According to you he was too mentally ill to be having sex at all because he could not be responsible enough to stop at any point and say \"this is not right I need to go\" even before he went to that apartment. \n\nIt's not on other people to make sure you are emotionally ready to have sex and are not trying to self harm through sex",

(Listen to how I wrote that, OP did not intend on sleeping with a *man*. OP did not state the abuser was/is trans at all, or that he was tricked into thinking that this trans person was cis (lying by omission) OP was tricked into thinking he was meeting up with a cis person, who did not ever come out as trans (per the story) & did not inform OP of everything that was about to happen) It\u2019s abuse in the sense that OP did not agree to the WHOLE situation. \n\nAlso, to your point about blaming OP for his hand at play. Yes he could have left, BUT FUCK YOU saying his not your sexual partners job to make sure the other party is ok with everything going on. YES you have to voice if you need something to be different but if you KNOW FOR A FACT that you\u2019re doing something they couldn\u2019t possibly know is about to happen/happening then you\u2019re at fault and coercing  the other party to participate in sexual acts they did not agree to WHICH is by definition RAPE. so yes it\u2019s sexual abuse.\n\nETA: I looked up the difference between abuse and assault\n\n>\u201dSexual assault typically involves adult survivors, while sexual abuse mainly refers to actions towards children, not adults.\u201d\n\nSo whatever",

It wasn't fair to you.\n\nI was raped by a guy when I was young and have lost friends over my negative reaction to being called gay. After a few years when some contacted me again I told them what happened, and they said \"well I didn't know you were abused like that.\" I shouldn't have to tell anyone that it happened to me for them to respect the fact that I am straight and have no part of me that questions otherwise. It should be enough for me to say, \"Don't call me that, I'm not.\"\n\nI've also been suspected of being gay or trans because I am fairly androgynous and exhibit a lot of \"feminine traits\" like emotional sensitivity and conversational skills, and not wanting to date anyone in my friend group when they were all women. When I get irritated and insist that I'm not, several have called me homophobic or transphobic. But guess what? I haven't seen or heard of them calling their local officials. I haven't seen them take a homeless trans person off the street and let them stay at their place while asking what kind of soaps and other items would make them most comfortable. Haven't heard of them donating to trans-help charities.\n\nI don't say that to prop myself up as some paragon of allyship, but when I have demonstrated support at risk to myself it pisses me off to see myself and other people get reprimanded.",
