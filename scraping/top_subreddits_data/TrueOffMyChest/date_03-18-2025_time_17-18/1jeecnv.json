    "selftext": "(TLDR at the end) My sister just died at 59 after living in a psychiatric nursing home for about 33 years. She experienced so much emotional and physical pain in her life that I'm having trouble coping with it. I wish she would have died in her late 20s when I saved her life by noticing that she needed surgery when the nursing home didn't notice. I wish she would have died 10 years ago when her doctor said it's time for hospice and I thought they were not valuing her life because it didn't seem as if she was dying at that time. I wish my undiagnosed ADHD hadn't contributed to her missing out on funding and care (I was diagnosed at 48 and I understand now why I wasn't able to complete the application). I wish that my parents (who really loved my sister) would have been able to help my sister more when she was an adult instead of me usually trying to figure out what to do on my own.\n\nMy sister developed hydrocephalus after falling out of a shopping cart at age 2 (discovered at age 4), and she had many brain surgeries throughout her childhood to adjust the pressure on her brain. Her brain damage first manifested as poor balance and being a slow learner. Then at age 10, she was hospitalized for mental illness for the first time. Although she graduated from high school and participated in track and cross country in school, she mostly lived in locked psychiatric facilities afterwards and she wasn't healthy enough to stay at a board and care, unfortunately.\n\nMy sister had a lot of extreme angst since puberty. It was absolutely heartbreaking. She was extremely spunky and determined, as you could see when she ran at school - she always came in last and often fell but she finished every race and never quit.\n\nMuch of her life has been very painful for me as her only sister who loves her a lot because she seemed so unhappy and had difficulties socially and was very lonely. (Fortunately, at times she had some friends or kids who were nice to her). As a teen, she pushed me away and was regularly physcially and verbally abusive because she was angry that I was one year younger and could do more than she could. (She never gave me a single bruise and I knew she loved me and was dealing with mental illness.)\n\nLiving in locked psychiatric facilities was devastating to her because it meant that all of her humble and lofty dreams didn't come true. She had a few boyfriends and friends at the facilities through the years, thank goodness, but there was a a lot of rage and angst, alternating with being sweet and fun, and it felt like too much for me to bear. I went to college 3 hours away and usually visited every 2-4 weeks.\n\nTwenty years ago, it became very obvious that she needed another brain surgery - the symptoms of advancing hydrocephalus included poor short term memory, sitting at a 45 degree angle (no joke) where we couldn't push her upright, etc. I had to fight to get her that surgery but actually she should have had more surgeries in her 30s to correct her hydrocephalus.\n\nThere were complications from the brain surgery 20 years ago including an infection the size of a golf ball which led to two more brain surgeries. As a result she had a feeding tube and couldn't move her limbs except for her right arm, so she became non ambulatory.\n\nJumping forward a bit, as a result of having a feeding tube for 20 years and being non-ambulatory, she eventually developed other issues. Five years ago, she got 2 nephrostomy tubes in her kidneys and then two years ago a colostomy which led to 2 fistulas (open wounds) and finally in her last week of life a massive bedsore that reminded me of a horror film.\n\nI am devastated for my sister that she went through all of this suffering. My dad basically drank himself to death when we were 18 and 17 because he was so upset about it right after he tried a last ditch effort to help her that didn't work. My mom had a hard time with how abusive verbally my sister was on our visits to the psychiatric facility (my sister blamed her for putting her in the mental health system), so my mom visited less for self preservation, especially as she got older and had lung disease, and due to the pandemic, she hadn't seen my sister in person in 4-5 years.  Our mom passed last year at 93.\n\nI became the court appointed conservator for my sister in 2009 and moved to be closer to her psychiatric facility in 2012 (just one hour away). It's a wonderful 5 star facility but still there were big problems at times, and while she had many good doctors, she had a horrible experience with her colostomy surgeon that led to a lot of pain until he finally removed a white rod as we kept asking him to. Then when she had 2 fistulas open next to the colostomy, it was painful for her every time her nurses needed to change them. That several times each day towards the very end.\n\nMy sister had extreme dementia, hallucinations, mental illness and brain damage so she couldn't tell us about her wishes for her health care.\n\nI feel as if my sister was a beloved dog, we would have put her down years ago, due to her pain and suffering. I'm wondering if in this kind of situation, it would have been better if we hadn't had the kidney stone surgeries 5 years ago or the colostomy surgery 2 years ago, if we had her on hospice sooner. I was confused about the right thing to do, and if God wanted her here longer for some purpose. I arranged the surgeries to try to prevent pain, which seemed to backfire in a big way.\n\nAs a result I'm going to make it clear to my attorney and relatives that my wishes are not to have any tubes unless I am able to ask for them.\n\nThank you for letting me get this out.\n\nTLDR: My very disabled sister died at 59 and she suffered greatly - I wish I hadn't saved her life 30 years ago or that I had listened to doctors who recommended going on hospice 10 years ago - If she was a dog, we would have lovingly ended her life a long time ago. This is very painful.",
