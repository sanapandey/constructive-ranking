Maybe this is the dumbest decision I'll ever make, but I don't care. \n\nI'll be doing this 100% alone. I'm divorced with one child already. Yeah things are hard, yeah we have zero family support. Yes society will judge me harshly. But I'm keeping the baby. ",

Your post is entirely about yourself and being defiant. Exactly like my mother (who I don't talk to anymore). It sounds like you have limited support and a lack of control and you having this baby is a way for you to take control. It's not. You will intentionally put yourself and your other child (and the new one) through hardship because of this decision. \n\nThe cons should always take precedence over the pros in cases exactly like this. My mother didn't and now my brother is murdered and I refuse to entertain a relationship with her. \n\nAll I can say is be prepared for what you will sow.",

Then she made the same decision when she found out she was pregnant with my brother. Having him gave her the strength to pursue her happiness. Was it conventional? No. Was it hard? Absolutely. But she now has a beautiful family and close relationships with her kids. She knew it felt right to keep us when everything else felt wrong and she found herself at the end of it. Everyone goes on their own journey and just because it looks different than others doesn't make it wrong. Make your decisions for yourself and prioritize your values. You'll find happiness.",
