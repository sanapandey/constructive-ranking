    "selftext": "The kitchen table is full of stuff, the counters are sticky, the sink has a layer of grime, the microwave hasn't been wiped in ages, the air fryer is disgusting, junk mail is piling up, piles of leaves are blocking the walkway, the bedroom we used to share smells awful and the one plant in there is fully dead, nothing anywhere has been wiped or dusted unless I removed items from there, the living room is only vacuumed because I still do it (he won't unless it's with a robot vac), but the carpet cleaner hasn't been used in ages. The couch is torn in places, his side caved in, and springs poking up under the cushions - but I've stopped looking for and sending links to affordable replacements. \n\nI'm not saying I'm perfect, plus I am moving rn and am doing my best to keep that stuff contained to specific areas. But I look around at the things I would've normally done or put on my to-do list to maintain shared spaces and all I can think is \"either he's going to have his work cut out for him, or he's genuinely ok living in a way that I know can't - all the time and energy I'm going to save not cleaning up after another person or taking initiative on simply bc he wouldn't think or care to... I truly can't wait. We'll both be free of expectations that were ultimately never going to be met.\"\n\nI hope he'll be ok. I think he's slowly realizing I made this choice for the good of us both. He was never a bad person or even a bad partner. The above was only one facet of why we broke up, and not even the main one. But it's funny to think that I'll have more time and probably less work when it's just me than when I had a partner.",
