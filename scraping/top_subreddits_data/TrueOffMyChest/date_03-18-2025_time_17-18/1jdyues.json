She snoozes it for 15 more minutes\n* Bathroom, first skincare, breakfast, poop, second skincare, long session of make-up and of hair styling \n* End up going out at 10:30 am or even later\n* Lunch/dinner: spend at least 40 minutes searching through Google Maps, TripAdvisor and Xiaohongshu for a place, carefully checking pictures and reviews\n\nThen of course there might be different things we prefer to visit, but that's normal and we compromise well in that regard. It's just the waste of time that bothers me very much.",

Whatever it is you want to do.\n\nAnd then you guys can meet up later. My ex-partner and I did that all the time when we were on holiday. He wanted to go to museum X, I wanted to go see museum Y, so we both did our thing and then met again two hours later, went for dinner and went home to the hotel. Had a lot to tell each other, share new infos and photos. \n\nYou're still your own person in a relationship. Live your mornings how you want, she can live her mornings how she wants, and then y'all regroup at 10.30am and do your thing together.",
