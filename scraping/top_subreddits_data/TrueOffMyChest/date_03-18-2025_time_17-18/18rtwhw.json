    "selftext": "Picture this: You're soul searching in between jobs, enjoying the single life to discover your inner self and allowing your mother to live above you and all you ask her for in exchange is a daily delivery of dino chicken nuggies and a refreshing bottle of mountain dew. It all sounds perfect, right? So why does it feel like something's missing? Well look no further because we have the solution for you...\n\n**Reddit Moderation!**\n\nWhat could more perfectly complement your fulfilling lifestyle than playing internet cop on Reddit? See a post you disagree with? You can delete it! User making valid points and hurting your feelings in modmail? Mute them! Having a bad day? Just ban a random, unsuspecting individual!\n\n`**Disclaimer for Mod Code of Conduct purposes: you can't actually do any of this`\n\nOn to more serious matters,\n\nWe are in need of more moderators to help maintain the subreddit. No experience is needed. All we ask is that you have the time, patience and a good sense of humor. Our team will be available to train you and answer any questions you have. Communication is a *must* and really, why wouldn't you want to talk to us? You'll be placed on a probationary period to start and we fully understand that mistakes will be made and activity may fluctuate. Please note that being selected as a mod does not guarantee you will be a permanent addition. Not everyone is a good fit and that's okay.\n\nSo what does moderating actually entail?\n\n* Clearing the queue will be your #1 task. The queue is where you'll see any content that has been reported or our automod has flagged for review. All you have to do is go through it, read the content and decide whether to remove it, approve it and sometimes report or ban a user. The queue fills up *fast* and needs a lot of attention. Seriously, some of you need to lay off the spam reports.\n* Modmail is your next task. It's mostly users asking why their post is missing (automod ate it 99% of the time) and asking that you fix it. We also recieve ban appeals here. If you're lucky, you'll get a death threat every now and then. Hooray! If any modmails are uncomfortable, too personal or upsetting to you, you can delegate it to another mod.\n* Sometimes a post will come up that's especially spicy or attracting a lot of attention. When this happens, one of our mods likes to comb through the comments for violations or sit on it to monitor incoming comments for violations. If it gets too much to handle, or someone isn't available, you can lock it.\n* Communicating with the team is one of the most important tasks in your role as a moderator. As a team, we discuss moderation actions, rule changes, sub events and the direction of the subreddit. That all sounds very boring but rest assured, there's a lot more casual talk than anything else so feel free to chime in on Beaver's dislike of garlic bread (encouraged), Tim sharing new sanrio drops or my Call of Duty K/D ratio.\n* Lastly, let's talk about the meta. Sometimes things need doing on the sub, like this recruitment post I was supposed to make months ago. While the day to day is important, we also need to keep the sub up to date with new features and tools and update it to fit the growing userbase.\n\nIf you managed to get through all that, congrats! You made it to the actual app, which is also long and annoying. Here's a tip for applying: there is a short quiz portion to the app. We don't care if you get everything right, we just want to see your line of reasoning and understanding of the rules and subreddit culture.\n\n[APPLY HERE](https://forms.gle/RwSTF7VQbPE4Djta9)\n\nThese apps are open indefinitely, and we will be doing staggered recruitment, so feel free to take your time.",

If the story is obviously fake, we'll pull it. If the account has conflicting evidence, even deleted, we'll take the post down and ban the user. If it's a very *well* written, believable piece of creative content with no evidence towards it being fake, we'll leave it. \n\nFake stories are an issue plaguing all of Reddit, especially due to users on other platforms farming fake content for views. Unfortunately, mod morale is at an all-time low, and there's a shortage of moderators, so I won't push my team to do more digging than they have to. \n\nAt the moment, if we suspect something is fake but have no evidence, I instruct mods to lock it in order to slow down the engagement and keep it off feeds. We do investigate things but we're no detectives. If you have evidence something is made up, please send it in to modmail.",
