    "selftext": "I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m allowed to disclose, so I'm gonna try to be careful to not reveal anything. I will be using he/him pronouns (not to indicate their gender i just want to make my post simpler to comprehend).\u00a0 Please bear with me this is going to be very long, but I cannot go another second without talking about this to someone.\n\n\n\nSome background on how it started, I met him when I worked part time for a catering company when I was in college for a private event that he was hosting a few years ago. He recognized some of the catering staff including me when we catered for another party that he had around 2 months after my first time working for him, so he asked some of the staff members to stay overtime (which we\u2019re absolutely not allowed to do but I was only scheduled for one more event before I stopped working for that company so it wasn't a big deal) so only a few of us agreed to and we stayed over for no more than 2 hours max. I talked to him individually towards the end of the night and we exchanged numbers.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe invited me over after he flew back from LA around 2 weeks after we last talked, and I was asked to sign an NDA so I pretty much understood what was going to happen that night even though he\u2019s not publicly out of the closet. The contract was very strict but there was absolutely no way I wasn\u2019t going to sign it, since I did know him prior to working his event. He\u2019s a pretty well known star in Hollywood, and he\u2019s part of a mega huge movie franchise that I loved when i was younger and  was part of one of my favorite shows ever, and it helps that he\u2019s pretty attractive so it was hard to say no to this opportunity. We spent nights together occasionally, like once a week sometimes twice even though he allegedly was seeing someone at the time (he's still seeing that person I believe).\u00a0\n\n\n\nI think it was around the 5 month mark when I started noticing some red flags. He would pressure me into skipping other commitments and coming over even though I had a lot of school work at the time. He would also pressure me into drinking even though I legally couldn't drink yet and he\u2019s significantly older than me (and he very much looks it, so his obsession with trying to be young and acting like a fboy in his early 20s is pretty embarrassing). Naturally, as I spent more time with him we kinda developed a more intimate relationship, so he kinda started to split his time between his partner and I (apparently the partner didn\u2019t know about me since he was filming pretty often at the time and they weren\u2019t spending much time together).\u00a0\n\n\n\nAfter a few months, he started being angry with me all the time and he sometimes got physical with me. He even forced\u00a0me once to try drugs so he can try to get intimate with me cause we weren\u2019t having sex for like a month (I now developed a phobia of medication or any type of hallucinogens).\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen I threatened to leave him, he would start accusing me of cheating on him and started screaming at me until I broke down. He also accused me of selling stories about how he's in a fake PR relationship with his partner and that he cheats on them with escorts. This was a constant problem that happened well over 10 times. I started getting very stressed and people around me in school and at work were noticing how irritable and panicked I constantly was. He also was very controlling and required that I have my location on at all times, which nobody ever asked me to do prior to meeting him so I felt like I was constantly being watched. \n\n\n\nI have to admit that I did talk about him to my closest friends only, which he later found out about and held over my head for months. The way he went about it was pretty insane though, he started threatening to sue and make my family go broke even though I assured him that these are longtime friends of over 10 years and would never tell anyone (partly because i\u2019m not out myself, only my friends know).\u00a0  \n\n\nThe moment I did decide I was absolutely done with him was when I found out that he\u2019s been filming us being intimate (something that I never consented to and would never be ok with). Obviously he did not care and tried to force me to stay, until he  started hitting me and punched my stomach real hard that the wind knocked out of me, then proceeded to force himself on me against my will.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe next morning, he kicked me out and blocked me everywhere, but not before saying that he wanted nothing to do with this relationship and that we should both move on with our lives. I had to stay with my best friend for an entire week where I was just crying without a single break, and my family were worried sick because I normally don't go more than two days without seeing them. Now i\u2019m dealing with severe anxiety and panic disorder that\u2019s just taken over my life. We ended our relationship right after I graduated from college, so I didn\u2019t have an opportunity to look for a job due to my mental state and I cannot support myself so i\u2019m staying with my family but they don\u2019t know anything other than I\u2019m dealing with a lot mentally.\n\n\n\nI hate that he\u2019s perceived as kind when he\u2019s the exact opposite. I also hate how he\u2019s been literally everywhere recently at every major film event recently acting all innocent and fake. I had to delete my twitter account because I kept seeing tweets about him at recent big award shows and I can't even stomach looking at his face. Thankfully I don\u2019t hear about him in my day-to-day life, but I saw posters the other day of a movie he\u2019s in which made me want to throw up (another thing he completely ruined for me, I can\u2019t stand watching movies anymore cause it was literally his entire personality the entire time we were together. I promise your deep knowledge of film history and shitty acting will not land you that Oscar you so desperately want, the academy will never take you seriously).\u00a0\n\n\n\nI can't talk to anyone about this except for pretty close friends that are aware of my sexuality. I\u2019m not out to my family, so they just see what a wreck ive been the past couple of months and there's no way to explain my situation without them finding out about my sexual history. I can't even  see a lawyer without my parents since I cannot afford it and there\u2019s no way I could ever involve them in this (they already think that I\u2019m potentially on drugs due to my state recently since I barely eat and always sit alone at home).\u00a0\n\n\n\nI don't know much about the law tbh, but what i do know is that I don't have the means to pursue this legally, and I absolutely cannot risk my religious family ever finding out and disowning me. I honestly feel like I would rather jump from a cliff than deal with my current mental state. Part of me just wants to say fuck this shit and to go public with everything that happened and fuck up my life cause it already kinda is, but I know that I will not have a home to come to when my family finds out about this. I\u2019m 100% sure I don\u2019t exist to that man so it just pisses me off that he gets to have this great life while I\u2019m the one that has to deal with the repercussions. It\u2019s absolutely unfair.\n\nThe most difficult thing to admit to myself was that I allowed someone to abuse me to that extent and still chose to stay with them (I feel so stupid in hindsight). I was hoping to find support or community here and see what i can do to cope with what happened to me, so if you have any advice in that regard please i beg you to share. ",

I understand what you are currently going through and at some points you might not want to continue, but if I listened to that voice in my head I wouldn't have went on to find the partner of my life and have 3 beautiful children with him. What I'm trying to say is that your life doesn't end here and what you went through does not define you. I pray for you and please know that my DMs are open if you want to talk <3",

I think I know who ur talking about but it's probably not a good idea to mention his name here. I'm sure that eventually he will be exposed for the predatory POS that he is, cause if he did this to you I imagine that there are others as well. Maybe if this gets enough attention other possible victims might come forward. I'm sorry that you had to go through that and I'm sending love your way. I hope you come back from this better and healthier.",
