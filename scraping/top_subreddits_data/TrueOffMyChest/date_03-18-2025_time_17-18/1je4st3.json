I think having kids is one of those things that are an automatic no if it isn't a \"hell yes\".\n\n\n\nI was an unwanted/unloved child and my narcissistic egg donor reminded me on a regular basis not only I wasn't loved or needed but that I was hated (to the point of death threats actually). However, that helped me understand what I said above and made me not want kids as soon as I was aware of that being a choice. Partially to end the cycle, you know?\n\n\nA child needs lots of love and care to grow up into a healthy, strong adult and a parent's job doesn't end when the kid turns 18, no. It's a lifetime commitment because that's your responsibility as a parent.",

Your daughter, your husband's family, your neighbor, a nurse all *endlessly* cause you problems, but you're always an overly giving angel that never gets thanked. EVERYONE wrongs you, but it's never your fault!\n\nHighly entertaining to read when bored, but I definitely feel bad for that \"spoiled\" one and done. YIKES.",

            "body": "I convinced myself in my 20s I didn't want kids. Then after getting away from my bf of 11 years I realized I didn't want kids WITH HIM. Deep down I knew the whole time he was a creep and a pedo, even before I found hard evidence and he confessed. After that I didn't even want a relationship with a man really. \n\nFast forward to 29. I started casually seeing someone who amazed me repeatedly with his gentle kindness. I still kept my feelings in check and my heart guarded. Then I saw him interact with kids. The warmth and regard he showed to them, truly respecting them as their own humans, knocked down all my remaining walls. I decided maybe a relationship was okay. But it wasn't the right time for kids anyway. \n\nDidn't matter though. Because my daughter showed up regardless. I was on BC, she snuck through anyway. Watching him grow into a loving, patient, thoughtful father has been almost as joyful as watching our daughter grow up.  \n\nShe hasn't thrown the \"I didn't ask to be born!\" line at us yet, but she's only 7. Having a kid is not for everyone. Most modern men don't deserve kids and won't take care of them. It will unfairly fall entirely on Mom. But if you can find one of the few that will put in the work and love for both you and your children, it's all worth it. \u2764\ufe0f",
