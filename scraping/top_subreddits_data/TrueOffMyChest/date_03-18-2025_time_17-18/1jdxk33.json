    "selftext": "My husband texted me a few minutes into his work day that he was coming home and needed to check himself into a mental health facility. I knew that the previous week, he'd had lingering thoughts that our child and I would be better off without him, but he seemed to get better in the days after that. When he got home he told me that the day before he looked up how much of his medication he'd need to take to kill himself and that was what made him realize he needed help. That's what our family and a few close friends know, but he told me two other things that had been eating at him. A few months back he had a week long, online flirtation. I'm honestly not so concerned about that, I don't think he would ever cheat on me. The concerning thing is that last month he got upset because the cat ate and killed almost all of his plants and so he choked the cat. The cat doesn't seem to be acting any different that I can tell, but I'm not sure what to do with that information. ",

Many times bipolar individuals dont understand what's happening to them and are unable to recognize symptoms and repory them (manic people often don't recognize that they are acting differently).",

And prescribing medication is not a universal fit either, the individuals personal brain chemistry and body processes factor into that in ways a lot of doctors do not fully take into account. Your viciousness in responding seems very unwarranted.\n\nMedication is a journey, there's no one size fits all. My husband started taking the same SSRI I was on shortly after COVID lockdown, I am fine on this medication. He had a gradual but fairly noticeable personality change over a period of 6 month, despite being medicated his mental health overall got worse in other areas. Eventually we got a change in his meds and in the period of going off the original SSRI he had a pretty significant mental crisis. There were extenuating circumstances, but a big part of him having a full on crisis is that the medication he'd been on was not the right fit for him and it destabilized him. Doing more harm than good basically. I can tell you that getting his meds reassessed and changed was a battle that ended up with him having to switch doctors, the initial one just kept increasing the dosage despite his feedback.\n\nOur general approach to prescribing and managing drugs for mental health conditions is not great. And the support and monitoring after prescription is often absolutely garbage. Medication can be a valuable support for people going through mental illness, but the way its prescribed and the lack of education and support provided is in general, awful. I'm saying this as someone on psych meds, and having gone through the painful process of managing my needs in several different states, as well as supporting my husband through the same, and hearing many of my friends having similar struggles.",

It took a lot of time for them to see I was me again. Tramadol is now listed as an allergy on all my medical files. \n\nSSRI\u2019s make Me numb, but like with the other poster, they can cause problems for some too. \n\nI also have OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) and have had such bad intrusive thoughts I was terrified what they meant about me. But OCD tends to cling to what\u2019s most important to you, and then twists that into fear. \n\nAt least he\u2019s safe where he is. But I can\u2019t imagine any cat wouldn\u2019t change its behaviour after being harmed like that. And they\u2019d fight back and he\u2019d have had bloody scratches. Did you take the cat to the vet? Was there any sign of pain in its neck?",

It's kind of a classic, everyone who has been cheated on thought that most of the time.\n\nFlirting is a choice, it's not an accident and for me it is cheating. As soon as you're looking as soon as you engage with someone with the intent of starting something it doesn't matter if you meet and fuck, just talking to someone with the intent is cheating. I have never and will never intentionally talk with someone like that in a relationship. I have caught a crush on someone while having a partner, I distanced myself when i realised, there was no intent there, crushes happen, it's the choice I made after it happened that mattered. I've also talked with plenty of other women, just not with any intent, just normal conversations. If the woman took the conversation out of friendly to flirting with intent it.\n\nAs soon as there is intent and you are trying to start something, it's cheating. You download tinder, doesn't matter if you get a match, just trying is cheating. \n\nPeople are also rarely completely honest with these things and usually trickle truth, a little truth to let them know you feel bad, to alleviate some guilt, but not enough to push them away.",
