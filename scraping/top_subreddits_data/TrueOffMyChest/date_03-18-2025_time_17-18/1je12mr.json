    "selftext": "I already know that everyone on this subreddit is judging me hardcore but please read this entire post before commenting (lol).  \nI am going to give some context for my non-Australian friends out there. In Australia, in grade 3, 5, 7 and 9, all students are required to complete something called NAPLAN testing. NAPLAN testing consists of group of standardised tests that is similar to the SATs in the US, and are done over roughly 2-4 days. The results of NAPLAN testing is sent to the Bureau of Statistics, and are then used to alter education curriculums and identify what areas in reading, writing, spelling and numeracy that the kids in that year group are struggling with. These are tests that you CANNOT study for or cheat on in any way, and the material on the tests are kept top secret until the day of the test (this piece of information is important for this story, don't worry).\n\nI did my first test, like many others, in grade 3. I was 7 years old at the time. During this exam, however, instead of having our regular teacher supervising us, we had a lady from the government office looking over us. This woman was SCARY. She was like that one gym coach that took everything way too seriously and was overly strict with rules. One of the weird rules that this lady put in place was that during the test (roughly two hours long), we were not permitted to leave the room at any time. This included getting a drink of water, stretching your legs, and going to the bathroom. To make sure of this, she locked the front door with a key. Looking back, this is an insane thing to ask of a classroom of 7 and 8 year old kids who have no control of when they need to go to the bathroom.\n\nThe test began as usual, and around 20 minutes in, I felt the need to use the bathroom. However, I was a very shy kid who never asked adults anything, and always kept to myself, so due to my fear of this lady and my fear of confrontation, I held it.\n\nAround 10 minutes go by, and I decide to ask if I can use the bathroom. I raise my hand, the lady comes over to my desk, I ask to go to the bathroom, and she refuses. I simply say 'okay, miss' and continue to hold it.\n\nAnother 5 minutes go by, and I raise my hand again to use the bathroom, as I was getting desperate and couldn't focus on my test. She came over and refuses. I said 'okay, miss', and try to get by while holding it. This went on another two times.\n\nAt this point, it was roughly 45 minutes into the two hour test, and I am physically struggling to hold it. I am angry, I am embarrassed, and could not focus at all on the material in front of me. I decide to ask this lady for a fifth time to use the bathroom. She STILL didn't get the hint that I genuinely needed to go. When I raised my hand for the fifth time, she glared at me and stormed over to my desk. She tells me that she 'knows that I'm trying to leave so I can cheat on the test' and that she 'doesn't like naughty little fakers like me'. My blood was beginning to boil at this point, as I had followed the rules the whole time, there was no way for a 7 year old to cheat on a test where no-one had the answers and that it was very obvious that I genuinely needed to use the bathroom. This lady looked at me dead in the eyes and scolded at me to sit down and be quiet. I simply said, 'okay, miss'. And stayed silent. She walked back up to the front of the classroom and sat back at her desk to supervise. At this point all of the other kids in my class knew that I was essentially being picked on by this teacher, and began to visibly feel bad for me. My frequent hand-raising was distracted them, as well, as it isn't often that a kid raises their hand that much during a test.\n\nI knew that there was no way for me to complete this test while badly needing the bathroom. Everyone knows the feeling of needing the bathroom so bad that it's all they can think about. I was raging at this, as I had lost my focus and that this lady was being mean to me for absolutely no reason at all. So I decided to have a bit of fun.\n\nI raised my hand for the sixth time. I waited for this lady to notice my raised hand. When she did, she looked INFURIATED and simply HORRIFYING. She had had enough of my 'shenanigans' and actually lost her temper. \n\n\"WHAT?! What is it now?\"\n\nI locked eyes with this woman and stared at her. Everyone else in the classroom snapped their heads up, as their focus was now broken by her yelling. I stared. And then I let it loose.\n\nI peed. On purpose. All over the chair. In a silent classroom. All while making direct eye contact with the woman who refused to let me go.\n\nBecause I was so mad, and now immediately regretting my decision, I began to cry of embarrassment. I was so pissed off at this lady that I physically couldn't hold my bladder and RAGE PEED IN THE CLASSROOM to prove a point.\n\nIt took this lady about two seconds to realise what was happening, and her anger turned to shock. Wow, a grown woman \\*shocked\\* that refusing a 7 year old to use the bathroom would result in them being unable to hold it. \n\nShe ran over to me, while I was still crying of embarrassment, covered in pee, grabbed me by the wrist, and rushed me out of the classroom and to the school office. I'm still sobbing while I was given a change of clothes and got permission to skip the rest of the test. \n\nWhen I got back to class, everyone asked me if I was okay, since they heard me crying during the test, and how I accidentally wet myself during the test. I went along with the accusation and told them that it was an accident.\n\nIt wasn't. I was a petty little girl, with no social confidence, who raged peed during a test at the age of 7. \n\nThe reason that I'm saying this now is because NAPLAN testing has commenced for the year in Australia as of this week, and talking about it as an adult now reminded me of this incident, and how I never told anyone that it was on purpose.\n\nFeel free to judge me now. I needed to get this off my chest (hence why I posted this on this subreddit), and I can think of this story when I need to channel some petty energy and confidence to do daring shit. \n\nThanks for reading. Piss and love x",

The test purpose is to help plan future curriculum and identify areas that need improvement overall but parents are provided with \u201cresults\u201d for their child showing where they sit in each percentile for each area of study (like reading, comprehension, maths, etc.). I remember seeing my nephews results for years three and five and they were interesting but basically showed what an involved parent would already have known about their child\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. Being made to \u2018practice\u2019 must put a lot of pressure on a child. I overheard an argument between a mother and her teen daughter at Big W before school started this year about whether or not she was going to complete the practice book. The mum kept taking it from the shelf and the daughter kept putting it back. All children should use your story as a protest move!",

I had crystals in my pee at the age of 9 because I wasn't allowed to go to the bathroom. It was so bizarre. My mom was livid. She had the school pay for my doctor visit and the doctor wrote a note to use the bathroom every 5 minutes. I also got to keep water or Gatorade with me through out every single day. Needless to say it flushed my kidneys and I may... Or may not have intentionally knocked over fruit punch Gatorade in her floor :)",

I had a friend who did the same thing, though it was in band class, and she was 14 lmao. \n\nWe had a substitute teacher that day who wouldnt let her go to the bathroom. No testing or anything, he just had a stick up his ass or something. She asked him several times, and eventually she just raised her hand, and told him she was going to piss in her seat if he didnt let her go (he didnt).\n\n Saw it as a power move honestly \ud83e\udd37",
