    "selftext": "A long time ago I posted here about how my husband (M32) and I (F28) were having this bedroom issue where I always wanted it and he rarely did. He was dismissive of my concerns for his sex drive having dropped off, and I was getting pretty depressed. \nWe eventually talked about it a lot, came up with a system where we\u2019d both know if the other was in the mood (based on a card system) so I wouldn\u2019t be afraid to initiate for fear of getting shot down over and over again\u2026and now I\u2019m in his shoes. \nI rarely want it, the thought of it makes me nauseated sometimes, and he complains about it if we go too long without, saying it makes him feel isolated from me. Part of me wants to point it out \u201cWow, doesn\u2019t feel so great to be me, huh? Wild how this is only a real problem now that you\u2019re experiencing it\u201d but the fact is that I\u2019m just so fucking sad instead of feeling vindicated. This whole thing is a slog. I\u2019m terrified to be sad or unhappy around him because he\u2019s not supportive at all, which just makes me feel worse. \nWe had an incident recently where our system said he was supposed to be open to sex, but when I tried to initiate (difficult for me because being shot down so many times before ruined my confidence), he told me he\u2019d just taken care of himself and wasn\u2019t in the mood. I was humiliated and mad at myself and didn\u2019t know what to do with that, so I tried to distract myself. \nHe said \u201cI love you\u201d then went to bed. \nWhen I asked him why he didn\u2019t try to talk to me about it despite seeing how sad I was, he told me that I was pushing him away whenever he \u201cdid anything\u201d. I pointed out that him acting like everything is normal and trying to sweep the problem under the rug isn\u2019t \u201cdoing something\u201d. \nI\u2019m just so frustrated and disappointed and sad. I feel like I\u2019m doing everything I can right now, but no matter what side of the problem I\u2019m on, nothing I do is ever good enough. I\u2019m always a failure. \nLife sucks, I suck, I always feel like he only loves me when it\u2019s easy. What a stupid miserable existence I have. ",

            "body": "I'm sorry. Maybe therapy if you can afford it?\u00a0\n\n\nSince you \"swapped\", it is now time to swap the cards too. YOU put out the card system when you are in the mood, and HE gets to initiate. Now he can do it since you had to for awhile.\n\n\nAs for your depression (?), can you see a Dr? Maybe meds?\u00a0\n\n\nBut your body may be sending you signals that you no longer want to have sex with him. Maybe it is saying you don't feel safe, wanted, etc. so it doesn't want that connection with him anymore. Something to explore in therapy. But if I don't feel connected to a partner, I don't want sex either.",

We can both see what each other\u2019s current card is, which should help alleviate the anxiety of risking initiating. Unfortunately I think the damage was already done.",

Or are you having sex because you genuinely want to be intimate with your husband? This can be hard to realize that you yourself are the one who views sex incorrectly ( or at least it was to me ) and the root of your sex issues is because you lack the right kind of intimacy. Do a dance class, a painting class or a painting date night, a pottery class, literally anything that the two of you have to do together and work together on even if you don\u2019t want to or you aren\u2019t interested in. Keep doing things until you find things you like doing together",

You both need to really talk. Heart to heart. If either of you struggle with opening up due to what's been happening write a letter so that you can read it and not having to worry about being interrupted or start an argument. Limit accusations and focus on feelings, and work together to find solutions.

Approach this with gentleness and vulnerability. Tell him what you've said here. He's most likely afraid of being vulnerable too. Work on communication. Plenty of books out there. And if you can find a therapist.\n\nTake it easy, breathe, and perhaps just sit with your husband, reconnect. Apologize for what you've said and done without any buts. Explain your feelings without accusations. Ask him if he's willing to work with you and start communicating better, and be vulnerable with each other. All you can do is try your best. \n\nAnd hell, perhaps abstain from each other when you are in a good emotional state and headspace. Tease each other, flirt, compliment each other, rile each other up, and don't have sex asap. Mental edging is seduction and the brain is the biggest and the most powerful sexual organ.",
