    "selftext": "The same week I moved out after 18 years together she started dating someone. After a few months they moved in together. I said I would like to renegotiate the alimony payments which were already outrageous because I was naive and stupid. Shortly after that she told me her boyfriend moved out and they were splitting up. She offered that if I pay half the remaining alimony now she would sign an agreement to terminate the divorce decree. I paid her $25k and a few months later they were married.",

I'll say that is cheap, money can always be earned back, and she will never be able to ask for more or adjust alimony if you do better in future. 20k is the price of your happiness my man. You will NEVER ever need to see her again and she is basically now someone else's nightmare. \n\nYou get to start your life afresh.",

When in fact he would have only had to make one or two payments before they were married. He essentially payed 22K more then he would have right?\n\n  \nAlso sounds like he actually payed for their wedding.",
