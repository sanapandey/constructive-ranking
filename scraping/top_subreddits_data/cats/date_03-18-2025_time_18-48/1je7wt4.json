Thought we had a mouse issue. To test my theory, I left a couple cheese-its on the floor to see if they got eaten up. After an hour I went out, and they were gone, so I was convinced there was a mouse. Next morning, I called the exterminator and scheduled him to swing by a couple days later. Later that same day, I got home from work (driving a work truck while this sits in the garage for the most part.) I jumped in that vehicle and drove it to pick my daughter (7f) from school. And when we got back, I cut the engine off and heard some meowing. Now, we have another cat (equally as lovable) and I thought I left him outside and panickily ran inside only to see him in the hammock in the window. At that moment I heard my daughter yelling \"Dad! There is a cat under the car!\" That girl rode in the undercarriage to the school and back ( 3-4 miles round trip) and was in very bad condition. \n\n  \nI ended up taking her to the vet to get scanned and she had a chip, but the owners flat out didn't want her anymore, so I decided to foster her while I looked for a loving home. Turns out, after about 4 hours of her being a foster-cat, I realized she was already in the home she needed and the rest is history. I'm very lucky to have her, and my other cat loves having a friend as well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1bycovh8hpe1.jpeg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9988d2c3abda6072166a80293436f02b9391a0e",
