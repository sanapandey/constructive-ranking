    "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nRecently we've received an increase in queries regarding our allowance for posts flaired as \"Mourning/Loss\". I'd like to address those posts here and why we allow them in the most coherent way I can.  \n  \nAs long as I've been a mod here (Almost a year and a half) these posts have been allowed, and to my knowledge, there was never a time when they were NOT allowed here.  The reason we allow these posts is because as our name \"r/cats\" suggests, we are dedicated to all things cat related. To us, Losing a beloved cat falls under that \"cat related\" criteria. While we understand that these posts may be upsetting to some users, the alternative would be to not allow them which may upset users in mourning. Unfortunately, with those options presented, it is impossible to please everyone. My personal advice (as someone who has lost a cat before) is to put yourself in the shoes of the users in mourning if you are against these posts. How would you feel if you took the time to write a tribute and pick out photos of your cat just for the post to be deleted?\n\nIf you are not mentally in a place where seeing a mourning/loss post is something you can handle, I recommend moving away from our subreddit, our goal is not to hurt you by allowing these posts. \n\n**WITH ALL OF THAT SAID, I WANT TO BE PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT WE DO NOT ALLOW PHOTOS OF DEAD CATS. IF YOU SEE A POST THAT CONTAINS A DECEASED CAT (OR ANY DECEASED ANIMAL IN GENERAL, INCLUDING ANIMALS HUNTED BY CATS) PLEASE REPORT IT TO US. WE DO NOT IN ANY CAPACITY ALLOW PHOTOS OF DECEASED CATS TO BE POSTED TO OUR SUBREDDIT.**\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this post or anything you'd like to add, please feel free to comment below\n\nThank you for your understanding \ufe0f \u2665\ufe0f \ufe0f\u00a0",

            "body": "To add a few points to the pinned post:\n\nAlways, always report rule violations and allow us to do the work.\n\nPictures must depict animals that are living at the time the photo is taken. If we want to split the hair even more finely, I think we can all agree further that the spirit of the rule is also that the photo should not depict the very final moments of a cats life - i.e. after the administration of euthanizing drugs, or after an accident that results in the end of life.\n\n**There is a zero-tolerance policy for rule 1 violations on loss/mourning posts**. Do not kick people when they are down. This will result in a ban.\n\nEmbracing all aspects of cat ownership is what this sub is about. It's not cute-centric, it's not happy-centric, it's not loss-centric, it's not centric to any particular country. It is a general subreddit. At present, the way for users to tailor their reddit experience is via subbing to subreddits as a whole - there's not a great way to tailor your experience within a subreddit by excluding flairs. r/ideasfortheadmins is a subreddit for suggesting features, though it is not admin-run. For now, if you want a specific experience, reddit is designed that need to join a specific subreddit.",

It won't be perfect though. I'll put something in place and keep an eye on it, so that it meets the needs of as many people as possible.",

So that's out, because we don't want to have to remove. Post guidance doesn't allow you to target specific flairs the way automod does, so any keywords will apply to all posts and therefore have to be selected carefully.\n\nI did put something in place - a two tiered system whereby some words will trigger a message (like the one that says \"be mindful of subreddit rule 1\"), and some words will block posting at all.

My baby was my first kitty who I raised since he was 3 months old. He had been with me my whole adult life and died in late October at 15. This was my first cat ever and the first time I was experiencing this type of loss. When he first became sick in July, seeing other people posts frightened me. I worried I was not strong enough to endure what was happening. However, as the weeks and months went by, reading the beautiful tributes, the ways in which some of us have been able to say goodbye, the grief and tremendous love in those final days, gave me the courage I needed to prepare my spirit to walk this path I knew we were heading in. I am so thankful to all of you and this subreddit for giving us this space to grief together in our own ways. For those of us at different moments in time with our kitty\u2019s, just know there is someone out there reading these and finding purpose even in the darkest moment of grief and loss.",

But it's nothing in comparison to what the person who sent the cat over the rainbow bridge is feeling. Instead of crying out that you don't like seeing these posts, please spare a thought for those who write them. They are often desperate for comfort when the people around them more often than not just say words to the effect of, \"It's just a cat. Get over it!\"\n\nAnother thing I've always said is that there are a lot of *positive* things to take from Mourning/Loss posts. They show what these cats meant to their ~~owners~~ slaves. They show how much the humans loved them. They show what their humans did for them to make them as happy as possible. What's not to like about that?",

I lost my beloved Fortuna (14F) last year. I had to have her euthanized last june (she had small tumors on her mammary glands and it metastasized, so by the time it was diagnozed, nothing could have saved her) and i'm still heartbroken about it.   \n  \nI get the need to share your grief and to seek comfort from other cat/pet lovers.   \nI get wanting to share pretty/goofy pictures of your beloved companion to the world, because no matter what, they were and will always be part of your family.   \n  \nWhat i will NEVER get is posting pictures of your dead animal online for clout. I had to report a post once, because clearly the poor cat was dead on the picture. If you had to have your beloved companion euthanized, you KNOW how it looks.   \nSeeing that picture threw me back one year ago, right when i had to come back home from the vet, with her empty cage. I was so traumatized when i saw that picture, i almost vomited. It upset me for several days. I couldn't even reopen the app on my phone by fear of seeing another picture like this. \n\nIf you loved your cat, and you want to post pictures of them, please share old pictures of them. I'm not saying don't share pictures of your cats. On the contrary, sometimes, just seeing a pet is what can make the day better for many of us. Just, DON'T post dead pets pictures.
