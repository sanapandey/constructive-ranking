Of course none of us needed to that, how could we?? I particularly remember this one cat surveying us while we were at some lounge type place by the desert; when she decided she liked us, she brought over her two kittens to say hello. \ud83e\udd79\n\n\nJust a tip (or at least a fun fact) if you find yourself around there, the cats in Essaouira were more fat and friendly than the ones in Marrakesh. I saw a lot of them also had their ear clipped which indicates they'd been neutered, which was nice to see. There were a couple of cats that kept strolling into the restaurant where my friends and I were having dinner one night; the poor staff kept ushering them out, only for them to come right back in as soon as they turned their backs. \ud83d\ude02",
