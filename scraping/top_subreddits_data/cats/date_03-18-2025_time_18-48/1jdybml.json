From lying in bed most of the time to waking up with this little bugger staring at me\u2014the constant meowing, the way she always tries to get my attention whenever I'm jotting down in my journal it\u2019s all so charming. It\u2019s amazing how a little kitten has completely changed my routine. These past few days, all I\u2019ve been thinking about is how to take better care of her and it's only been 2 weeks. \n",
