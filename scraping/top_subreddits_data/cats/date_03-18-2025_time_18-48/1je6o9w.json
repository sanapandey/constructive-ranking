She always sleeps in the [crook of my arm](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1jc7vy3/every_time_gaming_is_spent_with_her_in_my_arms_i/) when we're gaming, greets us at the door, sleeps between our heads on \"her\" blanket and is just in general always there. We always call her the \"Overseer\" since she wants to be involved in everything. She also loves strangers and will crawl on top of people's shoulders to be held as a baby....she's amazing and a professional [swimmer!](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/ukjtcw/its_impossible_to_game_without_her_wanting/)",
