    "selftext": "We adopted my cat Sissy 13 months ago as her owner passed away. Unfortunately she had an accident today when jumping off the couch and broke her leg because it was so brittle from the arthritis. The vet couldn't do anything. I'm devastated. She was so quirky and so full of life and I don't feel like it was her time to go. She brought so much love and light into my life, helped me get through a very tough year and made my life complete and I will miss her so much. \n\nShe loved to curl up on our laps after she'd had her breakfast. I hope you enjoy these photos of my senior baby \ud83d\udc9c",

He was only 6. It felt so senseless and I wondered for months if I did the right thing to put him down, but at the end of the day, loving your kitty is about doing what\u2019s best for them regardless of how much it hurts us. She\u2019s never going to have another bad day and you made sure of that, friend. You are strong and you\u2019re a responsible pet owner. Peace to your heart, I\u2019m so sorry\u2763\ufe0f",

She was so very lucky to have such a kind and wonderful person to look after her. There really was nothing anyone could have done differently though, so please don't let that other commenter upset you. \n\nIt's always too soon when we have to say goodbye to our precious little kitties, but take comfort in the fact that she lived a wonderfully long life and got to spend her final months being cared for and loved by you - I know you did the very best for her, just like you did getting her into the vets, following their expert advice and making the decision that was best for her xxxx",
