I asked where she was and he pointed to between him and the couch. Jezabel was having her kittens partially on him and partially on the couch. I got him out from under her but she was done. She had two little kittens. My son is 30 years old and still talks about that night.",

I'm assuming she's house trained?\n\nIf money is a concern, look into low cost veterinary care in your area. The kittens are going to need several rounds of vaccines. Also, look into a kitchen scale so you can keep track of their growth. You might want to get a cat bed for your bed, too.

Then every time slightly change the ratio of food to formula so by the time they are about 7-8 weeks they will mostly not bother mom for milk anymore.\n\nAlso, immunization shots at 8, 12 and 16 weeks are very important.\n\nMom will likely try to move the kittens to a new location within these few days so try to block off unwanted places with aluminum foil (unless she is one of those cats that really likes the foil).\n\nAlso, don't invite people who have other pets to interact with your kittens for the first 2 weeks.
