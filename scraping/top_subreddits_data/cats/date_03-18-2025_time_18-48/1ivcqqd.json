We are really concerned about a few things and would really appreciate any feedback or advice.\n1. We want to adopt a kitten considering it\u2019s easier to train.. up to 2 years actually but are flexible. Is this true? Or getting a bit older cat better? Also, are two cats better than one specially to give each other company, play and in general distress.\n2. We stay in a one bed apartment on the fourth floor so no outdoor garden time. Will that be okay for the cat or will we be detrimental for it?\n3. Lastly are there things we should keep in mind or think of before adopting? Or any general advice?\n\nThank you",

Scribbles was a stray that my boyfriend\u2019s sister found and gifted him. Tiger is the younger one and we adopted him from the SPCA. Scribbles is a female tabby calico mix while Tiger  is a male orange tabby. Scribbles was fairly well behaved until she found out about the counter but other than that she had been a great cat. Tiger is much worse than a dog when it comes to food. HORRIBLE begging and once he found out about the counter it was over. He\u2019s constantly on the counter, in our sink trying to see what he can find. And don\u2019t even get me started on how he managed to open our trash cans. One sits in a drawer and one is a stand alone that you push the foot peddle to open. He ended up breaking the drawer to the other and gets in it all. The. Time!!! And now Scribbles has started following his pawprints and doing the same things. We have tried spray bottles, tin foil, cat spray and positive reinforcement. But NOTHING seems to work! Just a few moments ago we had some chicken thawing in the sink and stepped to the store to grab a few things\u2026 Came back and Tiger was in the sink and had chewed through the bag while Scribbles had a WHOLE chicken tenderloin on the ground.  What can we do to prevent this?! This is really a desperate cry for help. We love them both so much and don\u2019t want to even think about having to give them up.",

I used cookie sheets and put water in them and setting them along the counters had about 4. Normally cats dont like getting their paws wet. Lining your counters with tinfoil can also help...not sure what you have tried but these are ones that worked for me. My cats dont climb on the counters anymore, at least not  what I have seen. Other options are a citrus spray of some sort, I had a male stray always spraying my BBQ the smell was horrible. I cleaned it off and cut a lemon in half and rubbed it all over the bottom half of the BBQ, you will have to do this once every 2 or 3 days but it did work for me. Inside the house a spray bottle with a cut up lemon and filling it with water kept my boys from scratching the furniture, may be helpful with the counter tops as well.",

I understand that you can't afford a vet right now, I'm in the same boat, but if you can afford some basic necessities to keep her in, she may eventually let you see what her injury is. It may just be a sprain, but living outside isn't an excellent environment to heal that; she would be constantly on the afflicted foot, sometimes even running to avoid a perceived threat. Providing an environment where she can stay might help.\n\nIf you get her in and see her injury and it is very obviously worse than a sprain, consider surrendering her to a shelter that can provide treatment. Or surrendering her to someone who fosters and can provide treatment; in my area fosters often have deals with vet offices for lower cost, and the work they do is truly wonderful.\n\nThese are just some options, I'm sure there are many other ways to go about this. This is just what I would personally do :)",

Affordability is why I couldnt leave him at the hospital. As is the invoice I was given included 112 dollars to clip and clean????? \"Are you kidding me\" I thought. Blood test came back no bacteria or infection. Why do Vets not perscribe an anti-inflamitory after such a proceedure? Only pain management and from what I have researched the meds do not offer any inflamation help for the urithea to prevent swelling causing another blockage???? It's been more than 24 hours and he still cannot even drink and wont eat. I am feeding him liquids with a surynge and trying to spoon feeding him but he wont eat. He will get up go to the water and ends up just standing in it thus I started using the surynge to get fluids in him. I'm told he will likely block again within 3 to 5 days without a 3 to 4k surgery to make the opening bigger...wtf!!! My rent is higher than my paychecks and I just find the vets I have spoken to are just gauging. The catheder was traumatizing enough. I usually feed him apple cyder vinegar for preventative measures but didnt catch it in time this time. Usually if I see my 2 male cats spending alot of time in the litter box I would administer the ACV 1:3 part ratio with water and they get back to normal. I missed it this time :(. It works if you catch it before they get blocked in the first place. I swear by the ACV. However once blocked well this is the result. He is so lethargic. He does seem to want to drink, thus last night he fell in the toilet he's so doped up. I brought him home about 2 ish yesterday it is 6:30 now. Is his behaviour normal? He has not even looked at the litter let alone use it. Any suggestions for an anti-inflammatory?",

Also later on try gently playing, like take a string and tie a knot in it, then drag it under a towel to make it look like prey. Play really builds confidence in cats of all ages, it makes them feel like hunters. Thank you for taking care of him.",

            "body": "Hello everyone!! I have a two and a half year old cat named Lara and we've had her for 2 years now. We found her outside and are a bit unsure whether she was an indoor cat or not because she seemed in really good shape and was used to the sand. We don't let her go outside except for the rare occasions where we accidentally leave the door open and she makes a run for it. That happened a week ago and she was gone for about five hours. We were really scared because as much as the neighborhood is a quiet place, there are unexcepted dangers outside, especially for a cat that has gotten used to the comforts of a home. The past days ever since she went outside, she's been upset, unlike herself and has been meowing a lot, standing in front of the door which tells me that she is eager to go outside again. My heart breaks but I know that the safest thing to do is keep her inside. I would really appreciate some advice on how to deal with this and how to help Lara feel happy and fulfilled inside. My brother and I have tried to put her on a harness and take her out but she hated it and wouldn't move while wearing it. We are currently looking to buy a better one but another worry of mine is that there aren't any quiet, green areas around us; the best option to take her is pretty far (an approximately 30 minute bike ride away) and we are worried that she might get scared during the ride there. I'm sorry if this was a long explanation. Hearing some suggestions on how to improve Lara's happiness and sense of freedom would mean so much to me. Thank you in advance! :))",

            "body": "Hi! Just adopted a 1 year old cat yesterday. We went to pick her up from her foster parents\u2019 home,  interacted a bit while we were there, but she was very very shy. After taking her home at 6pm, we took her directly to her basecamp in our empty guest bedroom (litter box, food, water, scratcher), we opened the carrier. She ran outside so quickly and went straight to the bathroom and hid behind our toilet (a place we didn\u2019t know could fit her, otherwise we would\u2019ve blocked it off). Now as newly cat parents we feel really bad that we couldn\u2019t foresee that. After reading a few Reddit posts, it seems like lots of people recommended to just leave her alone, put a litter box and some food and water inside. However my situation is a bit different given that she\u2019s behind the toilet and we do need to go in there from time to time to use the toilet + flushing. I have skipped showering for 2 evenings already just to give her more space in the bathroom alone to reduce the number of times we are coming in and out. I checked on her food, water, and litterbox and they\u2019re all untouched. It\u2019s almost 36 hours since she\u2019s behind that toilet. Today I gave her 2 sticks of paste treats and made some progress as she actually stuck her head out to lick it all, but quickly went back into hiding. \n\nWhat should I do next? I\u2019m genuinely worried for her health if she doesn\u2019t come out tomorrow \ud83d\ude1f",

Automatic feeders are great but remember dry kibble shouldn't be their entire dietary source. \n\nI will tell you it will be frustrating and it takes awhile for both you and your cat to adjust but cats really do learn habits and routines. It took awhile but we got ours to know which feeder is theirs so they all disperse to their bowls when it's time. Our scavenger kitty knows not to get on the counters and does a good job when we are present. We just need to make sure to do our part and not leave anything out, especially when we aren't present.\n\nCats will do cat things and if you are like me where you get impatient with things out of your control then it will be challenging but I can say you will also adjust with them if you stay consistent and learn their habits.",

I\u2019ve very glad I did get two for two reasons: I know they will get along and they keep each other company. They play together, they don\u2019t keep me up at night, when I am gone they don\u2019t mind. BUT you have to understand that it\u2019s like having a couple come and live in your home. They knew each other before meeting you so you might be the third wheel in their relationship. This might cause them to not have a ton of interest in you or your attention. If that is okay with you then I think it\u2019s a great idea. If you want a cat who puts you at the center of their world and who they look to for comfort and attention, then maybe getting one cat is best. I agree with another poster that brought up financials too. Just because you have two animals in the same house doesn\u2019t not mean you only need to get one large bed, one large food bowl, one large litter box, etc. They like having their separate items sometimes. I have a huge litter box that they like to share. Some cats won\u2019t share a litter box though, even if they\u2019re bonded. So just be aware that you may still have to get two of everything. 2x vet bills, 2x food costs, 2x toy costs, etc. \n\nOverall I am very happy as a first time cat owner to have gotten a bonded pair. I live alone and they are great company, even if they don\u2019t want to interact with me all the time \ud83d\ude05",

I\u2019ve been giving her a half tablet that\u2019s supposed to be a good anti-nausea and decongestant for a few days now and I\u2019ve applied a topical appetite stimulant on her ears, both prescribed by the vet.

We found homes for the kittens, had all spayed and neutered, and afterwards we have continued to feed the mother outside of our home.  She is semi feral I would say. She comes close to receive treats but won't allow us to touch her.  10 days ago she stopped coming for food.  After 10 days we had given her up for lost.  But on the 10th day we found her in a locked storage trailer.  She must have gone in there when my husband was getting wood out of his trailer.  I found her because she was talking loudly, I would say she was crying.  As soon as I tapped lightly on the trailer and told her we would get her out she stopped talking.  When we opened the trailer she did not run out. When I found her in a box she looked at me, jumped out of the box, and ran away, and then started talking talking crying.  She came for food and water.  We have not been able to catch her to take her for a vet examination.   After one failed attempt she became even more skittish.  Any advice?  She is running around as though she is fine.",

Shes very happy to get 1hour of attention from me throughout the day and other time she prefer to be left alone watching birds out of the window. She sleeps during nights instead of getting zoomies. My friend on the other hand got bengal and that cat want attention all the time. Smell its not only litterbox but cat itself. Litterbox is about what kind of litter you get, shape of the box, and tyere also stuff you can get to help with smell. But it will still smell like poop right after they poop, till deodorant kicks in. Clean litter box at least daily or even twice, it also help keep cat healthy. Yyou would also need to vaccum hair all over apartment to help with smell. I would be more worried about size of apartment cuz if you do get energetic cat they will climb everywhere. They also need personal space, places to hide, cat tree(if you dont want your furniture scratched), feeding spot, drinking spot.",

The female seems to have designated the front door area as her toilet, whereas previously she went in the garden. We don't currently have a cat flap as we did, but we do let them both out regularly. Unfortunately, she is less keen on the new garden and prefers to stay in. It is a nuisance, but at least predictable, so we have put puppy pads down and I am working on making a custom box that shields that area and stops anything going on the floor. We did try putting a litter tray near the front door but clearly she has just designated that space as being the toilet so there is not much to do except, as I say, shield it. \n\nThe male cat uses the litter box that we have put by the back door just fine. 8/10 times he does everything in there and so there is no hassel. Unfortunately, he has the habit of sometimes using it to pee, but will then jump out and ten seconds later defecate somewhere else. As much as I am glad he uses the litter box most of the time, I just don't understand the sometimes when he chooses to defecate somewhere else. I can deal with the female cat's behaviour as it is consistent, but the male is a real issue. I'm not sure we can modify his behaviour at such an advanced age, and as much as I love him, it is hard not to get angry at his ridiculous toilet problems. So far all that I do when I know he is going to defecate is scoop him up fast and dump him back down in the litter tray.\n\nJust wondering what my fellow cat owners would do in this situation.",

My kitty, Benny, (black and white boy on the right) has FPV and seasonal allergies, I\u2019ve been thinking of starting him on lysine to help relieve some of his frequent respiratory upsets. My concern is that about three years ago he went into acute liver failure and it was BAD. He lost ten plus pounds, has completely yellow anywhere you could see his skin, Ihad to have him on a daily fluid IV, feed him baby food because he wouldn\u2019t eat, and give him constant anti nausea medication. Miraculously he recorded, one day he just starting meowing for his food like he used to after weeks of being on deaths door, he started eating again, put the weight back on, and the pink color returned to his body.\n\nThe reason this worries me is that I\u2019ve seen a couple sources say that there\u2019s a potential risk there because lysine is processed in the liver, and might affect it if he has any sort of damage left over from whatever triggered his first bout with liver failure. I don\u2019t think he or I would be able to handle him going through that again. So I\u2019m wondering if anyone here has any experience with lysine in liver sensitive cats??",

I had him checked for thyroid issues due to change in eating habits, vomiting and keeping us up all night meowing. Well, he is still keeping us up all night. I will play with him a lot during the day. He gets lots of exercise. He has a climbing wall, 3 cat trees, tons of toys and  our other cat to play with. I am at my wits end. I have tried doing a larger meal at night. Calming treats, cat nip, and after speaking to vet we tried melatonin. He is relentless with his meowing. I have tried ignoring him. He just gets louder. I have tried bringing him to bed and snuggling him. I'm losing my mind! I love my boy very much but I am exhausted. Advice?",
