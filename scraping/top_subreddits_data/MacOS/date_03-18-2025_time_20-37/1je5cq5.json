Apple's neglect of macOS polish fits this so well. Instead of fixing functionality, they're pushing half baked \"intelligence\" features that degrade user experience. macOS is turning into an over-engineered mess prioritizing gimmicks (Apple's priorities) rather than usability and what users really need. Classic enshittification, just with an Apple twist.",

It is purely an indication of the dialect or language a person speaks.  This exact change is characteristic of most of the Germanic languages, and I can't imagine it's your intention to pretend, for instance, that all Dutch or all Swedish or all German speakers, or their ancestors, are/were lacking in intelligence.  There is no meaningful difference whatsoever with some populations of English speakers doing the exact same thing, as this is almost certainly what happened in those other languages as well.",
