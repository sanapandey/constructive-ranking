You will from time to time need to use your key and you will be screwed without it, just like those fools that lost millions/billions of dollars of crypto when they lost their key. It\u2019s a hard lesson.\n\nAnd then, of course, are you storing the key securely? Or is it on the equivalent of a Post-it note where anyone could find it? How many people do you know that have their login information written somewhere near their computer?",

You should enable FileVault. \n\nIf set up properly, you can make sure any Mac is virtually useless to would-be thieves. \n\nFor Intel-based Macs, if you [set a firmware password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204455), then the computer will refuse to start up from any internal or external storage device other than the startup disk you have selected in the System Preferences > Startup Disk preference pane. This means a would-be thief won't be able to start up the computer with any other storage volume - even if they take the startup drive out and replace it with another one, or connect an external drive and try to boot from it. With newer Apple Silicon Macs and Macs with the T2 security chip, this is the default behavior (with some additional protections) thanks to Apple's [Startup Security](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208198). \n\nIf you enable [full-disk encryption on the startup disk](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204837) by enabling System Preferences > Security > FileVault, then a would-be thief won't be able to boot from or access the encrypted data on the startup disk - even if they remove it from the computer and put it into another computer or enclosure. Your data is safely encrypted.\n\nAnd if you enable [Find My Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205362#findmymac), then if your Mac is lost or stolen, you'll be able to track its physical location, display a custom message on it, play an alarm sound on it, lock it, and even erase the contents of the startup drive - all remotely from any iOS device or any computer with a web browser. In fact you can do all of that ahead of time, and iCloud will dutifully wait for the computer to connect to the internet and ping the iCloud service, whenever that happens to be.\n\nI configure all of my Macs this way. And I've tested their setups by logging into the iCloud web site (http://iCloud.com) or the Find My iPhone app on any iOS device, and using it to activate those features. I can do it all remotely from the Find My Phone app on any iOS device or on any web browser on any computer, wherever I happen to be at the time. I'm happy to report it works extremely well.\n\nI rest fairly easy knowing if my Macs are ever lost or stolen, not only is my data very safe from prying eyes, but anyone trying to use those computers is in for a rude awakening: they won't be able to do much with them at all.

It's.a local drive that already restricts access to the users account via password.  Even with File Vault enabled, that user password would give you access to your local drive.  Yes you can add the security key and never really use it, making it CRITICAL to store it somewhere that you remember.  This becomes difficult insofar it would rarely be needed.  \n\nPasswords are stored in the password app, and again your user id and password is all that's needed there.  So, the bottom line is that if you travel with your laptop often, it may make sense to turn FV on.  However, since local data is in your hands it may not be necessary.  Rather focus on securing cloud stored data, you have a MUCH greater chance of that data being accessed,  \n\nTo your other question FV once encrypted does not really have an impact on performance.  It's a good question to ask, you have to determine your risk of locally stored data somehow getting in bad actors hands.  Just remember if you loose that security key with FV enabled, you simply cannot access that data.",
