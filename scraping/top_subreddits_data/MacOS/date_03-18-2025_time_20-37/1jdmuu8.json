I\u2019m not sure regarding Silicon-powered Macs and the \u201cmodern\u201d versions of macOS post-Catalina with regards to booting from cold into an installer, wiping the drive in Disk Utility and then running the restore from TM option. It used to work on Intel machines but obviously much has changed in the last few years and Apple seems to prefer the route of installing the latest macOS build via Internet Recovery and then subsequently restoring user data from a TM backup rather than restoring both user data *and* the OS to an earlier state, as you are essentially asking.    \n\n\nAs I said, a lot has changed in a few short years and we\u2019re a long way from the old days of replacing or upgrading storage before installing the OS version *you* wanted rather than Apple mandating that you use the latest build, ostensibly as much for security purposes as anything else, and not making it easy to simply rewind the whole computer to a previous state. At the end of the day it\u2019s how Apple operates and while the AI stuff should be optional it\u2019s here to stay so we\u2019re going to have to get used to it sooner or later, unless you plan on never updating your machine again of course.",
