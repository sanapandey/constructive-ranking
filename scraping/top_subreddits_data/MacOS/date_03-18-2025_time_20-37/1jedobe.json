For example, I want to have email and messages on one space, then music and Safari on another space. Is that possible with any other method?\n\nEdit: I'm actually able to get 2 windows on a space but they both appear as a split screen.",

Think of them as a sort of kludged-in iPad-like window manager. macOS has too many ways to do this kind of stuff!\n\nYou just want a virtual desktop. I won't bother you about how this used to work really well and was enshittified by Mission Control, but basically - go into Mission Control, e.g. by pressing F3 or using a trackpad gesture, and you'll see your windows all laid out in the main area of the screen, but also a strip along the top showing you little icons representing desktops and new windows.\n\nOver on the far right of that is a big \"+\" icon. *This* is what creates a true new desktop, with menu bar, dock, normal window management, the lot. You can create as many as you like.\n\nThe swipe gestures to move between desktops and full screen windows all work here, and you can click and drag in that strip at the top to reorder things. Very annoyingly, you cannot give the desktops names, so you're stuck with \"Desktop 1\", \"Desktop 2\" etc. - a decade-old or more feature request, but we get shit like Apple Intelligence instead.\n\n* You can drag a window from the area below that strip to any of the little strips at the top to move them between desktops.\n\n* Hover over a desktop's icon in that top bar inside Mission Control to close it. Sometimes that's buggy and the little on-hover \"X\" doesn't show up. Try a swipe gesture to switch between spaces, then have another go. macOS is a buggy mess these days.",

            "body": "Yes, you can open Mission Control (swipe up with three fingers on the trackpad, press Control and up or search for it in Spotlight) and then you'll see a bar at the top, where you should see the text \"Desktop 1\" in the center. If you hover over this bar, at the top right, you can see a plus icon. Click it will add a new desktop that works just like your main one. In Mission Control, you can then drag your windows into that second desktop and then click on it to switch to it. You can then switch between the desktops by swiping left or right with three fingers on our trackpad or pressing Control and the left or right arrow keys, or by using Mission Control.\n\nTo delete a desktop, go into Mission Control and hover over its thumbnail in the top bar until a little X appears at its top left, that you can then click. If you want to move a window into a new virtual desktop, you can also start dragging it into Mission Control (or drag it into the menu bar and keep pushing it into the top of the screen until Mission Control opens) and then continue dragging it to the top right and dropping it straight on the plus.\n\nIf you want to maximize something in the space then, you can press (I think) Option+Control+F or, if you have the setting in System Settings - Desktop & Dock - Double click a window's title bar to \"Fill\", you can also double-click the window's title bar. You can also do it by holding option and clicking the green traffic light button or in the \"Window\" menu in the menu bar.\n\nI hope I could help, let me know if you need anything else.",

I have a long-standing second space and find that windows flip back to the wrong space across reboots and app relaunches. For example a finder window with tabs of my source code & related directories in the second space with my development apps, that\u2019s often in my first space with other Finder windows after all reboot. A bit annoying but I\u2019ve been able to deal with it.",
