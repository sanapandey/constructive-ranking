This required Apple to create a way to disable them on app launch instead of manually by a user.\n\nMost videoconferencing software (Zoom/Teams/etc.) also have their own built-in reactions, so the Apple ones were often a redundant feature that was often turned on by default when it was unnecessary.",

They could have added a page of \"reactions on/off\" toggle switches somewhere in System Settings (similar to how privacy settings work) that would give users far more granular control and simultaneously fix the Zoom Room issue I mentioned previously.  \n\nThe way they designed it with the super annoying pop-up menubar notification is probably the least user-friendly way they could have implemented a fix.",
