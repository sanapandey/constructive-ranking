    "selftext": "So this happened with my Contacts app last week, and after a few hours on the phone with Apple Support and sifting through the Reddit forums it seemed that the culprit was having both a Google and iCloud contacts database, and exporting all Google contacts then importing to iCloud seemed to help. But now, Passwords is going bananas with memory hoggin. This is currently on my 2024 iMac, all updated to current software versions as of 3/18/25. My MacBook Air crashed last night due to Passwords taking up 8.9GB of memory per the activity monitor. \n\nHas anyone seen this before? Or know how to fix it? \n\nThanks I appreciate and love you all. ",
