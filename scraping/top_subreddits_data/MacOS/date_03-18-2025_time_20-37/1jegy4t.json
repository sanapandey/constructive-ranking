That failed, and now every time I try install either with physical usb (sequoia on usb drive) and internet/normal recovery mode it always seems like it\u2019s fine but always boots to a blank screen or a Apple logo -> circle with line through it. Any help will be appreciated. I tried installing macOS hundreds of times and it\u2019s just fried. Any help?",
