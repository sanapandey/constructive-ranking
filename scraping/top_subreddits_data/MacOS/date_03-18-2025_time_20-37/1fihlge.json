Then it takes Apple about a year to fix all the issues in the new OS (i.e. Sequoia).  Time Machine was first introduced in macOS 10.5 (Leopard) and one would expect that Time Machine would be solid in macOS 15.  I have confirmed with Apple Support that this is a known issue within their internal bug database.  However, I'm having all types of issues with it including not being able to perform a backup.

Given the various ways this can present, a lot of these network issues people are experiencing *might* be related to this.\n\nThe issue is that when the firewall is enabled there appears to be some sort of packet corruption. How this presents is SSL failures in browsers or web sites partially load or fail, wget and curl to HTTPS will hang indefinitely shortly after starting, SSH sessions will drop after a few minutes, VPN services are slow and/or unreliable.\n\nThis is very easy to verify by enabling the firewall and doing a large file download using wget from the CLI. Do a Linux ISO or something similar. If it hangs (typically 15-120 seconds), you're impacted. Since it only takes a minute or so to test, run it a few times just to verify, then toggle the firewall off to verify the fix.\n\nFor now, if you're impacted, the only known workaround is to turn the firewall off.\n\nI work for a large tech company, and we (our IT org) opened an issue and notified Apple directly during the beta program. Unfortunately the issue is still present in both the 15.0 RC and 15.1 beta.\n\nedit: Since people are still finding this comment, this was improved in 15.0.1, and was just fully fixed as of the latest 15.1 beta (beta 7).",

I've with a bootable USB disk but also download the entire OS from the recovery mode, both do not work.\n\nMacBook AIR 15'' - M2 - 8gb RAM",

I actually had a peripheral with a Realtek adapter which I sent back because it performed noticeably worse than the ASIX one. I have four peripherals with ASIX adapters and they're working great.\n\nI have a suspicion that there might be different firmware options or revisions with breaking changes for AX88179 adapters. I always make sure the adapter I buy is specifically advertised with Nintendo Switch compatibility, which is definitely the version that is A) the ASIX adapter and B) a variant that doesn't need additional drivers.\n\n**Edit:** I haven't seen anything definitive yet, but maybe that's the difference between AX88172 and AX88172**A**?

Restored once from time-machine backup for a repair, the tech's at the apple store repair reset it.  Some exact issues.\n\n1. Sharing display via airplay to apple tv is broken. The contents gets cut on the apple tv, views perfectly fine on macbook display. Cut is on the upper side as someone suggested below; cuts ( sometimes) the entire menu bar, sometimes a few pixels. No fix.\n2. Battery life worse on sequoia than on sonoma ( latest version). I have a very predictable worflow, and do a lot of work connected on a remote VM. Occasional local apps like obsidian, safari ecc, but rarely.  Before used to finish a 9 hour workday with 30-35% left. Now 20- 15%.\n3. Battery drain in standby- lid closed-  worse on Sequoia ( all versions, starting from 15.0 to 15.2). On sonoma it used to drain 1 % at best overnight. Now it's between 4-5%. Same settings obviously.\n4. Finder does not remember smb credentials. Saved to keychain. If the server disconnects or has an error, it forgets the credentials. Saved them 100 times, even if I can manually find them inside the keychain it still doesn't connect. Go figure.\n5. EDIT: cannot watch youtube on safari. Major problems since Sonoma, carried out in Sequoia. There's a bug where if you go forward manually on a video, a lot of times it will bug out and it will go in a loop of reloading the few seconds forward forever. The white line showing the preloaded video will appear- disappear- appear-disappear forever. The temporary fix is to reload the page. Never found a solution despite resetting to factory settings when I got the mac. My solution was to change browser. Happens only on safari, not on other webkit browsers. \n\nApart from the worse battery life, not major problems. Smooth sailing so far.",

            "body": "LAPTOP: MacBook Pro, M1, 2020. Basic model. \n\nOS + BROWSER: Sequoia 15.2  + Safari, Version 18.2 \n\nISSUE: I am having a major problem with Safari. Ever since I upgraded to Sequoia, it is running super slow. \n\nEXAMPLES: \n\n\\-- I try to duplicate a tab that I always duplicate, and it takes forever to load the content, sometimes even for Safari to open the tab. \n\n\\-- In Incognito, I was shopping this morning, and quite literally shopping carts couldn't hang onto whatever I was putting in them -- completely bizarre. \n\n\\-- Yesterday, on my health plan's website -- took about 5 min to load a page, and when it does, it's timed out. \n\n\\-- Popups have become a *nightmare.* I tell Safari to just let them through on certain sites, but every time I restart Safari, it keeps rebounding to default setting. \n\nI'd say these were all issues w/the websites, but I now simultaneously run Chrome on the same sites on a MacBook Air, M2 that I sit right next to me and that is not yet upgraded to Sequoia, and it flies. Also, not to rub salt in the wound, but my laptop works fine if *I* use Chrome. \n\nSo.... not sure what's going on? \n\nTHINGS ALREADY TRIED: \n\nFirst: Obviously restarted the laptop. Twice actually to start. Ensured that I had *quit* Safari first. \n\n1. Cleared ALL history, cookies, passwords, etc, etc. Quit Safari. Restarted. \n\n2. Added Developer tab to Safari, ensured sheet was correct in the Systems Developer option & the cleared the cache using the Developer tab at the top menu. Went into Finder, pulled up the .db files, got rid of those.  Restarted. \n\n3. Ensured everything else was completely closed out on the laptop. Babysat Task Manager. No spikes, no weird things happening anymore than they *always* are because the gremlins and daemons actually own my laptop. Went back into Safari, tried high demand work (Photoshop via the web). Lasted a good... 8-9 minutes? And then slowed *again*. Sigh. \n\n4. Ran speed test on network -- sure it's not that though, since all the other Apple devices, laptops, iPads all work fine, and so do browsers. Sure enough -- all fine. \n\nKNOWN ISSUES: \n\n\\-- posted here before. This laptop is junk, and I *know* memory is an issue. *But* \\-- been working with an Apple Business rep and clearing this thing off, de-gunking it, etc, and, contrary to what *Apple* says, he's been having a *lot* of success getting it functioning partway since then. At least... until this mess started. \n\n\\-- I can't keep too much open all at once or there is a break in the Matrix. I was careful to have *everything* closed at restart each time and only open Safari so that it was an honest start. \n\nQUESTIONS: \n\n1. Can I downgrade my Safari? \n\n2. Do people recommend a different browser? I went *back* to Safari after a --cough cough-- cybersecurity/intel person recommended it. That said, obviously this is an issue. What is the best transfer? Chrome? Firefox? Ditching the internet? I really would love to hear from people \"in the know\" on this if possible -- would greatly appreciate your time! \n\nAs always... thanks everyone... \\*glares at Safari\\*",

Normally I stay 2 to 3 major versions behind because I learned my lesson about Apple\u2019s aggressive update cadence the hard way, but when buying a new Mac you don\u2019t get a choice. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve experienced in a week of ownership;\n\n- Migration Assistant failed twice, the first time it aborted halfway through, the second time it stated it completed successfully without transferring anything (dangerous if the user trusts that it had done so!) \n- when running first use setup with enterprise WiFi; experienced an issue with it repeatedly asking for credentials - before the previous dialog box asking for credentials could be filled \n- Calendar iCloud sync wouldn\u2019t work until sync was toggled off and on again, only local calendars would show \n- Mouse sensitivity keeps resetting when using fast user switching\n- About 20% of my carefully curated Apple Music artwork didn\u2019t migrate, despite many attempts wth the AMPArtworkAgent\n- something happened with iCloud family and my daughter\u2019s name was set to my wife\u2019s name\n- I\u2019ve had unexpected terminations of Mail, Music and Photos about a dozen times. \n- Deleting photos in Photos takes about 60 to 90 seconds to complete. There\u2019s no indication that the operation is successful or pending \n- upon connecting my iPhone to transfer photos, it appears as LOC:<6 digit number>, rather than the actual iPhone name, in the Photos sidebar. No photos show as being available to transfer. \n- When importing photos from an SD card or similar, if there are photos with the same file name in different photos, duplicates will silently be ignored and not imported. You have to check the number of imported photos manually. If you format the card in this case, you will lose photos. \n- Had an issue where I had the same mounted SMB share appear around 60 times under /Volumes. It was only mounted once. \n\nNot bad for a week with the new system!\n\nEdit: A couple more bug discovered in the last coupld of hours:\n\n- In Apple Music (the program, not the service), search results are showing a black thumbnail for some albums, even though album art is populated for that album\n- Also in Apple Music (the program, not the service), if you do a search, then navigate to s asearch result (say, an album), then click back, search no longer works until you manually clear the search box. For example, overwriting the text in the text box, or adding text, has no effect. It sounds esoteric, but it causes search to behave quite differently to just about any other modern search UI and is quite annoying. Though I think that bug has been in Apple Music for about 4 or 5 years.\n- In Finder, I've had a couple of instances where columns can't be resized until Finder is restarted.\n\nI think Apple's modus operandi now is to shift the cost of QA onto custoemrs, because evidently our time isn't as valuable as theirs. I'm happy to be on your QA team if you want to pay me, Apple!",

Even more - in both Sequoia and Ventura there some issues using Finder or starting apps while TC backup is going.

I don't have issues with anything that the users in this thread talked about. No VPN issues (Proton VPN), and no issues with rotating WiFi addresses either. But, there is one issue that did not exist in Sonoma, that exists in Sequoia.\n\nThe issue is with my BT mouse. I use the BT connection instead of the 2.4 GHz, and here is the situation \u2013 the mouse always stays on BT. I don't turn it off for the most part. If I go to class, the mouse stays at home, and I come back and use it. What used to happen in Sonoma is that I turn my Mac on, shake the mouse a little bit, and it connects instantaneously. On the Sequoia version, that doesn't work. I am unable to connect to the mouse using BT either. I tried turning my mouse off and on, and that doesn't work either. I have to go into the settings, forget the device, turn on pairing, and re-pair the mouse. This is so frustrating.\n\nDid anyone using a mouse face this issue? If so, how did you solve it?",

Attempt booting from a fresh install on a Lightning external drive (I tried this with a USB 2 drive with a USB 3 adapter but it will not boot from it). I have to buy this drive to attempt this though.\n2. Attempt a fresh install on the internal SSD by adding a new partition in Disk Tools in Recovery Mode (feels risky - disk only has about 120gb free)\n3.

Nothing else has changed about my set up after the update, so I feel very confident that the 15.2 update is the root of the issue.\u00a0\n\n**Here\u2019s my set up prior to Sequoia 15.2 Update:**\n* Macbook M1 Max, 16-inch, 2021\n* MacOS Sequoia 15 (not sure which previous version)\n* External displays:\u00a0\n    * Working normally: \u201cDisplay 1\u201d, LG 27GN650-B (connected via HDMI port)\n    * Malfunctioning, flickering: \u201cDisplay 2\u201d, LG 34UM69G-B (connected via usb-c port, USB-C to USB-C display cable)\n\n**Steps that failed to resolve issue:**\n* Follow steps 1-4 outlined here. Did not resolve issue.\n    * Unplug cable and monitor power cord\n    * Mac is already at latest update\n    * Restart Mac\n    * Change color profile of external monitor to Color LCD\n    * Change refresh rate to 60 hz\n    * Disabled true tone/night mode where applicable\n* Changed USB-C cables, and tried plugging USB-c cable into different USB-c ports. Neither resolved issue\n* Swapped display cable from USB-c/USB-c to USB-c/DisplayPort. Did not resolve issue.\u00a0\n\n**Steps that resolved the issue so far as of Dec 19, 2024 at 11:06:**\n* Swap display cables between Display 1 (working) and Display 2 (malfunctioning):\n    * Display 2 is now connected via HDMI cable to mac HDMI port\n        * Color profile: Color LCD, 60 Hz refresh rate, no true tone/night\n    * Connect Display 1 via DisplayPort to USB-C mac port\n\nSince swapping display cables between external monitors, the flickering has stopped. I will update accordingly if anything changes.\u00a0\n\nUpdate Dec 19, 2024 2pm: Unfortunately, the flickering still occurs but it's less often and less intrusive. The flickering happens maybe once an hour. And, instead of my mac thinking the display has been disconnected and rearranging all my open windows, it's just a brief off/on flicker and no windows move.",

At the end of December (when Mac OS 15.2 and S1 7.0.2 were released) when playing music, the cursor and all the visuals freeze. Of course, I tried reinstalling s1 starting from version 7.0, I even tried to run version 6 - the problem remains. Tried creating a new user. Tried safe mode. Tried disconnect all ext devices. I went further and reinstalled Mac OS. Didn't help. I went even further and made a bootable USB flash drive with Mac OS 15.1. 1, but that didn't help either.\n\nI wrote to studio support. Doesn't help either. We should call them soon and they will try to help me remotely, but for some reason it seems to me that the problem is in Mac OS and Metal 3. Or the worst thing is a problem with the hardware, but everything else seems to work fine, although the rest of the visuals have become sharp, but this is most likely self-hypnosis. Other DAWs don't have such problems. I tried Studio one 6 and it has the same problem.\n\nExample on Google Drive for those interested [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oCNvOz-h6TZQxkA94H2jBUqp4bOfQOeh/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oCNvOz-h6TZQxkA94H2jBUqp4bOfQOeh/view?usp=sharing)\n\nupdt.  \n06.01.2025\n\nAfter almost a month of experiments, it turned out that the problem is most likely in Metal 3, because when the graphic hardware acceleration is disabled, the problem disappears.",

A fixed, non-random MAC address is absolutely fine for a home network. Breaking my network connection on upgrade because of yet another half-baked feature is not. This is a shared computer, and an unnecessary security warning concerns my better half every time she sees it. At most, you should display a warning that randomised MAC addresses are a good idea when the option is changed, but showing a continual warning that unrandomised addresses are a security risk all the time is wholly unnecessary.\n\nI'm really beginning to loath this computer. 29 issues raised to Apple since December.

In the end, the only fix is to completely blow away the Spotlight data and remove folders associated with Spotlight and reboot. Then the machine spends the next two days reindexing everything.\n\nWhen I try to re-index using mdutil, I get the error that Spotlight is disabled. Nothing I do with mdutil will restart indexing.\n\nIn the end, the only thing that works is the following (from [this website)](https://www.spyhunter.com/shm/fix-macos-sequoia-spotlight-issues/):\n\n1. Open Finder.\n2. Click Go > Go to Folder from the menu bar.\n3. In the search box, type /System/Volumes/Data/ and press Return.\n4. Press Command + Shift + . to reveal hidden files.\n5. Locate the Spotlight folder (e.g., .Spotlight-V100), right-click it, and move it to Trash.\n6. Next, go to Go > Go to Folder again and type \\~/Library/Metadata/.\n7. Delete the CoreSpotlight folder.\n8. Empty the Trash to remove the directories permanently.\n9. Reboot.\n\nI'm sure this isn't necessarily the best way, it's kind of a sledgehammer and isn't really helping me understand what's going wrong, but I need Spotlight to work. \n\nIs anyone else having trouble with Spotlight in Sequoia?

I couldn't stream internet audio via the Apple Music app (I'm not a service subscriber, but I'm using internet radio stream URLs) and one of the services I do subscribe to, with its own MacOS app AND with URL streams I play through Apple Music had the same issues: would play for a few seconds then stop and say (in Apple Music) that it was trying to rebuffer...but would never start up again. (I noticed that the higher the bitrate of the stream, the sooner this would happen.) With the service's own app (CalmRadio), it also quit playing, but would start up again after a few more seconds, then stop, then start, then stop, etc.\n\nThe same thing that happened in Apple Music happened when I listened to these streams in VLC: play for a few seconds, then quit (and not start up again). \n\nAmazon Music (via its MacOS app) seemed to work fine, though. (I think Pandora also worked, with the browser interface, but I didn't really spend a lot more time exploring it, since Apple Music is my primary music source.)\n\nI knew it was my Mac mini (only), as well, because I turned off cellular data on my phone to only use my WiFi and, using that CalmRadio music app there, had zero issues streaming audio. Only on the Mac mini did it stop-start-repeat.\n\nI tried everything I could think of, because I hadn't even remembered that there'd been an OS update: uninstalling some software that had added a bittorrent port forwarding rule to my router unbenownst to me; turning off IPv6 for both my ethernet and WiFi connections; installing WireShark in case I could discern something there, despite my utter ignorance; several other things.\n\nBut then I came here and saw some comments regarding the problems with Sequoia and the MacOS firewall. So I turned that off and, voil\u00e0, my internet audio streams work just fine! Of course, I don't love operating without a firewall, so I'm only turning it off when I'm streaming music and am not doing other things. But I wanted to post this here if anyone else had this specific problem with streaming audio and was pulling their hair out trying to figure out what might be the issue.",

I went into recovery mode and the keyboard and trackpad worked. Like an idiot, I reinstalled sequoia and once it updated again it went right back to not working. I then was not even able to get it back into recovery mode. I took it to an apple authorized repair shop as Genius Bar had no available appointments for three days and the repair guy quoted me like 1600 for repair parts saying it was hardware related bc he saw some damage when he took it apart. This is not hardware related. Yet here I am having to buy a new laptop as I start classes in three days and don't have time to waste trying to get this crap fixed.",

At some point (I think ~1 year post-release) Apple released a software update that resolved this issue. Now with Sequoia, photos and videos taken by this camera universally look extremely grainy/noisy.\n\nI would upload some examples but all of my photos are selfies and I would rather not dox myself. If you have any photos saved in Photo Booth from ~2021 (which look okay, but not great), compare them to photos from late 2022-mid 2024 (which look great), and compare those to any photos taken now (which look like shit). You can check the date by right-clicking an old thumbnail and selecting \"Export...\".  Every photo taken now looks worse since upgrading to Sequoia. At first I thought this might be due to lighting conditions, but no, the problem persists in bright light as well.\n\n- Model: 16\" M1 Pro MacBook Pro 2021\n- MacOS: Sequoia 15.1\n- Applications: Photo Booth, FaceTime, QuickTime, literally any application that uses the built-in FaceTime HD camera.\n- Workaround(s): the only software \"workaround\" I've found is using an app that does its own image processing to remove noise, like Zoom, which makes things look better but still just okay. Also, not really a workaround, but if Apple's goal was to make me purchase a 3rd party iPhone mount for my MacBook, then they succeeded.\n\nI submitted feedback to Apple within the Photo Booth app, but I'm not sure if anybody will ever read it, and I have found no discussions of this bug anywhere online.",

Now I'm getting this annoying gap around every maximized window. No, I do not want to be using \"full screen mode\" for each app, I want to continue using my macOS the way I've been using.\n\n**Are there any workarounds for this?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rtmcvqfl8l6e1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=37f013797f63f30f5317d9d4b9c1961a2de238e6\n\n(This is what I got from ChatGPT):\n\n\"The gap you're seeing when windows are maximized in macOS Sequoia is a design choice introduced by Apple. It aligns with their philosophy of maintaining a distinct visual separation between windows and the edges of the screen. This change aims to enhance usability by avoiding edge interference, such as accidental clicks or gestures near the screen edges, particularly for macOS\u2019s gesture-driven features.\n\n\n\nHow to Make the Gap Disappear\n\nUnfortunately, macOS does not provide a native option to disable this gap entirely. However, there are a few workarounds:\n\n\n\nFull-Screen Mode:\n\nUse the green maximize button (top-left corner of a window) to enter full-screen mode. This will eliminate the gap, but it moves the app into a separate space.\n\n\n\nThird-Party Apps:\n\nInstall apps like Rectangle or Magnet to manage window sizes more precisely. These apps allow you to maximize windows to fill the entire screen, bypassing the gap.\n\n\n\nTerminal Commands:\n\nWhile unlikely, there might be terminal tweaks or hidden settings specific to Sequoia to adjust the window behavior. If you're comfortable with Terminal, I can guide you on how to check for any potential tweaks.\"",

After it updated I can no longer use my USB keyboard and camera anymore.\n\nHere\u2019s my setup:\nKeyboard and camera both connected directly to my monitor which is an LG 34wq73a via USB, not sure if 2.0 or 3.0 but checking online it seems it may be 2.0.\n\nThen a USB C cable from the monitor to my laptop (Macbook Pro M3 Pro 2023) which used to pass video+keyboard+camera and charging prior to 15.2. Now only the charging and video works.\n\nThe monitor is used as a kvm between my work laptop and a Mac Mini M2 which is on 15.1.1 and connected to the monitor via HDMI and USB type B, the devices works well on it.\n\nI\u2019ve tried resetting the laptop and resetting SMC which didn\u2019t work. The keyboard does work when connected via USB C to USB C straight to the laptop.\n\nWhat may be the issue and how I can resolve it? Thanks!",

There are also other issues with MacOS user interface, like stuttery scrolling (esp. in built-in apps) and stuttering when moving windows. The drunken mouse pointer is the strongest and most constant symptom though.\n* No issue: Videos or games do NOT stutter at all. It seems to effect only UI elements and especially mouse behaviour.\u00a0\n* Expected behaviour: A mouse pointer and UI that work as smooth as I know it from using one 60hz monitor (very nicely).\n\n**Workaround**:\u00a0\n\n* Play two videos (Youtube, Twitch). One on each monitor. Mouse pointer is smooth again all over the place. Stop one video or switch browser tab > stuttery pointer is back.\n\n**Setup**:\n\n* MacMini M4 Pro / 64GB / 2TB (first 2024 batch) on MacOS 15.2 / 15.3\n* Monitor 1: Benq 32\u2019\u2019 4k 60hz\n* Monitor 2: Benq 24\u2019 1080p 60hz\n* Input devices: MagicMouse, Trackpad, Logitech MX2 Master (Dongle)\n\n**Did NOT work:**\n\n* Use two 1080p monitors, remove 4k monitor\n* Use a wired iPad Pro via Sidecar as secondary monitor\n* Various combinations of monitor inputs, cables and adapters\n* Use various input devices\n* Use various browsers\n* Update MacOS from 15.2 to 15.3\n* Try different resolutions (no stutter when mirroring both monitors 1:1)\n* Disable any fancy UI features in settings\n* Use BetterDisplay & Co.\n* Remove any relevant third party app (browser, monitor, mouse etc.)\n* Remove any potential interferences\n* Boot in safe mode\n* Use fresh user account\n* Reinstall MacOS (15.3)",

What's really odd is that when I plug the same monitors into my girlfriend's MacBook (an M1 model), it detects both displays without any issues.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar? Could it be a hardware issue with my M3 MacBook, or is this more of a software problem? I have one monitor connected via HDMI-to-HDMI, and the other through a USB-C to HDMI adapter.\n\nWould appreciate any help or suggestions!",

            "body": "Newcomer to Sequoia (15.3.1) having just replaced an older MBP that was on Big Sur. The thing that's driving me nuts the most is the constant disconnecting network drives. I have two drives connected in Finder; my NAS (connected via SMB) and my Time Capsule (connected via AFP) and I'm constantly getting pop ups like this telling me they've disconnected. Sometimes that message flashes off quickly and the drive access is maintained, other times it sits there until I click ignore, and then I have to go back to Finder and either remount it or click one of the shortcut folder links that remounts it. The two problems this causes is 1) the NAS is where my music is housed, so when that disconnects my Music app stops playing and any sync to my phone fails, and 2) I can't do a Time Machine backup to my Time Capsule as it fails when the network share disconnects/unmounts. \n\nI can't seem to pin point what causes it either: sometimes it does it when there's high network traffic, but other times it does it when my internet or network is doing nothing (like it literally just did it now while I'm typing this. I do notice that often when I'm doing something with one share, it's the other that disconnects (like if I'm copying a file up to my NAS that might take a little time, say 2-3gb), the Time Capsule share drops off. Of if I'm trying to run a backup to my Time Capsule, the NAS share drops off. \n\nI'm sure this has been brought up here; I haven't looked though all of it - I found this thread during some searches to try and work out if it's this particular MBA or if it's a macOS thing. This doesn't happen (or at least very seldomly happens) on my 2015 MBP on Big Sur 11.7 (or previously Mojave 10.14) so at first I  thought it was this new MBA (M3, 2024) but I'm beginning to think after some googling and reading that it's probably a Sequoia issue...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zh72wckcaome1.png?width=1349&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c5767fb37864a3319c2c5358b56642292e3641d",

I was just messing around with the new features such as 'vocal shortcuts'. This is where my first problem appeared the microphone symbol was on my menu bar and just remained on even if I removed the vocal shortcut. Thanks to reddit I found that deleting the 'coreaudiod' process fixes this. However now I have discovered that my bluetooth sony headphones don't work. I can connect as i normally do but no sound comes out. The only thing I've\u00a0learnt is that restarting my mac does the trick but this is crazy having to do every time. \n\n  \nI can't figure out why this occurs too, I thought it may be linked to the wifi issue where if you close the lid and re-open it the wifi doesn't work anymore however both this bluetooth headphone issue and the wifi is a hit and miss sometimes it doesnt connect and othertimes it's fine. I'm not sure if it's after a long period the laptop lid is closed and then it won't connect as well. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this and know how to solve it? I'm also new-ish to a mac,  how do I reverse this update and not lose my files lol or just mess up my computer i just don't trust apple anymore. I don't get how they can roll out an update with issues to essential computer needs. \n\n  \nthanks",

I hope someone more technical see's this the only thing I have figured out is it is to do with the microphone. For example I connect my headphones and they connect asap as normal but no sound comes out. I then go on the voice memo app and record a short memo literally just breathing or saying hello and end the voice memo. It's obviously recording with my headphones mic and then if replay the memo or go to spotify or whatever music starts coming out. It saves me having to restart but is still ridiculous.\n\nI don't know if this will solve your situation as it's a little different to mine but something is up.

It worked on Ventura, and it works on an M3 running Sonoma, but it stopped working after updating to Sequoia. Annoyed enough by it that I made a community account to post it on there [https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255796158](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255796158)\n\nBesides that, updating straight from Ventura to Sequoia broke a lot. It appeared that it had for some reason duplicated my user, and deleted my previous user, and some things were owned by the new user and some things were owned by the old user that it had deleted anyway. I could use admin access for some things, but other things wouldn't. For example, the users and groups panel in system settings was totally blank, and settings had no mention of the apple ID I had logged in to. Spotlight wouldn't work no matter what I tried from several different forum posts, and checking the file ownership on spotlight and seeing it was owned by the deleted user was what tipped me off on that. I tried to go through the \"erase all content and settings\" to reset it, but it hung for an hour on signing out of iCloud before giving me an error that it couldn't, and subsequently it would give me that error every time I started the erase all content process, so I gave up and formatted and reinstalled. Now everything works as expected except for external monitor in clamshell mode, and it's honestly making me consider going back to recovery and reinstalling the OS it came with.",

If you want a sample file to try opening, you can download some from this site: [https://polyhaven.com/a/klippad\\_sunrise\\_2](https://polyhaven.com/a/klippad_sunrise_2)",

Everything is stored in iCloud to enable this.\n\nI intend to add the new Mac Mini with Sequoia to this configuration and it will be my main device for creating and editing. I was hoping to put the old iMac in another room for my wife to use. As we share some Numbers files, will this become a problem and is there an easy way around it. I want the Mac Mini to always be on the latest Numbers release, so I assume this (depending on functions used) will make those Numbers files incompatible with Ventura. Will Ventura screw up the files or is there a read only function I could use (like on iOS)? Does MacOS have a way of automatically getting round this (maintaining 2 versions of the file, say)",

Specifically \"Hue in the Menu\" a cool menubar app that allows you to quickly control Hue lights/systems. It needs Local Network access to function, and it's always been enabled. After installing 15.2 - I noticed it stopped working and tracked it down to that setting which was somehow reset. Perhaps take a look at the Local Network settings and ensure the widget you are using is permitted to use Local Network.  \n  \nFWIW, I have seen the Local Network permissions dialog pop-up before for other apps, and on at least one occasion I have also inadvertently dismissed that dialog without granting permissions, forgot about it, and had to spend 15 minutes before I realized what was going on.  It would be super helpful if developers started being a bit more thorough to also surface back up the lack of permissions in some way for apps that depend on them to function.",

I cannot believe that - as my Hackintosh (brilliant iMac machine from 2012) with Linux on it -may not be able to run certain programs I need for a big 2025 workload, I am forced into getting a Windows set-up purely to enable workflow and productivity.  I need a big memory, a word + numbers type program that works and internet browsing - that's IT.  Whenever I've phoned Apple Support (a lot in the last eight years, admittedly, because I keep blowing $ on new Macs that I expect to work right out of the box) they've always acted like I was trying to split the atom on the machine - \"what were you trying to do?\"  \n\n  \nme: Cut and paste a paragraph. \n\nApple: Third party software can interfere with blah blah blah. \n\nme: NOTHING is installed on there. \n\nApple: If you're using an older machine or have not updated blah blah blah\n\nme: I wouldn't say it's that old - I got it a month ago and there is no update yet\n\nApple: we need to get one of our technical experts onto this and they will contact you in XYZ days. \n\nApple: Sends generic \"sometimes restarting your computer will help\" email two weeks later. \n\nAnyway, I read that the current CEO of Apple is retiring soon - is there any chance that MacOS might return to being awesome or do I need therapy. I wouldn't complain so much but I built my business and career on Mac - it's always aided my productivity and creation, I am having problems coming to terms with the fact it has become my greatest obstacle to getting things done.",

We've just added a brand new iMac M4 running 15.2 to our office and connected it to a network drive (on a Windows machine) as the rest of our machines are. On our 2015 intel iMacs, previews are near instantaneous, however, on the new mac previews of even a 15kb jpg take up to 10 seconds to appear. As you can imagine, that is unusable for a work environment, or any other environment frankly. \n\nI thought maybe it was a \"wifi is slow\" issue, but again, all of the older machines work flawlessly in the same manner. Another note, on this new mac over the same network a 3.5gb MP4 had an instant preview, loaded instantly and played back with no stuttering. \n\nI've read quite a bit about people having similar problems using a NAS (after all, these new iMacs come with a paltry amount of internal storage so a NAS is the only way to go) but no solutions.

This function has been verified by several others using Sequoia. Yet it never gets fixed. So far none of the updates have correct it, although some of them seemed to at first but it soon reverts. The problem is in Finder if you click and highlight the title of a file, and then click on the top bar Edit button and in the drop-down menu choose \"Copy\", the normal behavior would be to have no information in the copy function, unless you were copying the file itself, then it would show the file name. And this is how it will behave if you just have just started your MacBook. But once you copy a title after highlighting it, the next time you go to copy a different file title it will show the title of the previous file you copied or won't even further back to the last one. If you copy the title anyway it will copy it correctly and paste it correctly, but it's distracting and confusing because it shows a previous title not the one that you're copying. It really shouldn't show any titles if you're just copying the title, if you right click and use the drop-down menu which shows \"Copy\". It will only clear the previous title if you restart your computer. Not only that is this confusing and distracting, in some situations it can be a security issue because it can even show the titles of files that have been deleted.",
