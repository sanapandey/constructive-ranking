There are a lot like them esp sa age group nila.\n\nSuper dami nila, a lot would refer to it as a stereotype. Old school rich bisaya. Dati paman ganyan na yan mamustura si Du30, hindi ko naman sinasabi na unbranded or branded mga sinusuot nya but his aesthetics have been like that even before he made national headlines. Kahit nga magsuot sya ng mamahalin, or formal\u2014 halatang halata sa galaw nya na he's better off with wearing pambalay if he could.\n\nMga netizens lang naman nag ooveranalyze ng lahat. Kahit pa i advise sya ng PR team nya na simple speaks louder, he doesn't even have to try cz that's how he's been since god knows how long. So no, it's not a facade but it's no secret din na he comes from money. Now whether or not it's blood money, I really couldn't care any less.

But if u see honeylet hindi sya kasing bongga ng ibang politicians wife. Si Kitty is typical teenager na parang neglected spoiled brat child. \nI dont want to disregard honeylets hustle kasi masipag naman talaga sya ipalago mga business nila plus marami yan orphanage sa Davao.\nThey are not poor from the very start kasi nga d ba nung campaign kinukwento pa ni pduts na nagpalipad sya ng helicopter sa mismong taas ng bahay nila.

That's why it's so funny yet sad at the same time when lots of Pinoys buy this \"makamasa\" or \"rags to riches\" or \"totoong tao/ordinaryong tao\" narrative that many politicians try to present themselves with. \n\nIt's so laughably absurd yet ironic because those who are supposed to represent and fight for our welfare as commoners are often the ones who aren't actually in touch with our everyday realities. A lot of people also try to ignore things like this just to support personalities, not ideals nor principles for the common good, and fight for people who don't even care nor know their existence. \n\nFanaticism and putting up people on pedestals, be it politicians, celebs, musicians, role models, or any authority or idol/hero figure, are never good ideas in the first place. There's also truth in saying never meet your idols/heroes because you're likely bound for disappointment.",
