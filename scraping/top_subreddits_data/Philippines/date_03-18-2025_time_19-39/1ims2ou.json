    "selftext": "Now that the official campaign period for national positions has begun, we will be implementing new election campaigning guidelines on the subreddit. This aims to keep campaign-related posts to a minimum and prevent spam from local and national candidates from flooding the subreddit.  \n&nbsp;  \n\nTHe mod team will be **removing campaign posts that do not provide relevant discussion topics or newsworthy context (e.g., \"Vote straight ____\", typical campaign posters and materials).**\n&nbsp;  \n\n#1. What if I want to campaign for my candidate?\n\nYou can post updates related to their activities, but please don't post outright campaign materials. That's considered spammy and uncool. If you want to post about an event related to a candidate, provide an outline of the program and activities. We don't want people to come to your events without proper information.  \n\n#2. What if I want to campaign against a candidate?\n\nLow effort posts against a candidate will not be allowed. if you want to post, provide and fact check your sources. Discrimination and Harrasment will not be tolerated. \n\n#3. What if I want to discuss something about a candidate?  \n\nYou can talk about a candidate but provide some background for a meaningfull discussion.  see #1. News related articles are exempted.\n\n#4. I'm representative of a candidate and want to interact on the sub.  \n\nIf you are a representative of a candidate, you can schedule an AMA (Ask Me Anything) for your candidate.  **[reach out to the mod team to assist you and schedule your AMA](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPhilippines&subject=AMA_HELP) so we can pin it on the sub**  \n\n\n#5. Are you affiliated with certain religous group?\n\nFuck off  \n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNote that these guidelines may change depending on community feedback and response.  r/Philippines will remain a nonpartisan subreddit and will not endorse any candidates in the upcoming elections. While the mod team may have personal preferences, these will not influence the subreddit policy.",
