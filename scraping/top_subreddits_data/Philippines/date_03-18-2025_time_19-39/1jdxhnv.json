We all want this cult or rather, mafia pretending to be religious tradition, removed from this world too.\n\nWhat makes them a cult in the eyes of other Christian communities as well as the world at large is their disregard for these marks of the church whether it was catholic, orthodox or protestant.\n\n1. Instead of Scripture being allowed to be read, studied taught and interpreted by all its members, only its \"heads\" were allowed to interpret it and everyone else should just lap up what they say. \n\n2. A cult basically wants to control its members minds, hearts, wallets, etc. No free will.\n\n3. It started with a charismatic leader with a following and bawal tanggihan or magkamali yung leaders. Parusa if tumiwalag, strongarm mafia style.\n\n2. No church discipline. Someone commits sin as in that which they preach, excommunicate. Why do these cultists have assassins and death squads?",
