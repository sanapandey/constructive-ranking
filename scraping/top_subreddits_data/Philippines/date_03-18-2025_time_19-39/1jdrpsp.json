Bakit nadamay pa ang judge dito, eh ginagawa lang niya ang trabaho niya. Kapal ng mga mukha, eh sila nga sira sira rin ang Ingles, malamang Taglish lang rin ang kaya nila, eh yung judge, malamang fluent Romanian at kung French ang gamit niya sa trabaho bilang judge, maaaring fluent na rin siya sa French. In fact, marunong pala siya mag English, Spanish, at Italian rin. \n\nNakakahiya talaga. Anong yari sa pagiging professional? Ang mas nakakahiya ay kapag nag dedemonstrate sila sa ibang bansa. Walang respekto para sa bansa ng dayuhan na pinapayagan lamang sila tumira doon.",

And depending what IT job you're doing where I live you could start at $55-60k and probably go to $150-200k a year as a senior IT manager.\n\nThe same Filipino lifestyle ain't gonna start till your making $500k+ a year, or $20M pesos.   All rough numbers off the top of my head.  I live in the 4th(?) largest city in Canada, and probably 3rd most expensive.",

Some landlords still think they can charge too much.\n\nRenting a basement suite, 2 br, that'll be $1500. Some are nice, some are crap, you gotta get lucky to get a nice one. \n\nA whole house will rent for $2000+ (depends how big, but some people can't afford to buy so it sucks)\n\nReal estate is still increasing, just luckily a push was put on apartments because the supply was ridiculously low so developers started to build some. \n\nMy house, which I own (well me and the bank) has nearly doubled in value in nearly 14 years and is now nearly $775k.   It's only ~2200 sq feet or 200 sq meters and 3br, plus basement (which adds another 55 sq metres or 600 sq feet and 2 more bedrooms).\n**EDIT: and I'm not bragging, my house is nothing fancy.**\n\n\nElectricity is cheap by Filipino standards, I pay 8cents per kwh. But of course there are hidden fees for delivery of elect service, etc. Plus gas for heating the house, another $100 a month.  Some people basic utility bills are $500-700 a month which again depends on how much you use which also depends partly on how big of a house/apartment you have.\n\n\nAnd you gotta have a car because public transit here sucks so that's a huge expense, car, gas, insurance, insurance is about $1-4k a year depending on your driving record and the type of car you drive. New drivers pay a lot for insurance, and if you have a nice new car you pay more also. Gas is currently ~$1.40 a liter where I live. (57p/L)\n\nFood is probably similar.   The only thing I know is relatively cheap in the Philippines now is local fruits, I know rice has gotten expensive there. Canada most food is expensive. An 18 kilo bag of jasmine rice, not on sale, will normally run $38-40 (1500-1600p). On sale I've seen it as cheap as $28, but that's rare. Hell, even beef here isn't cheap. And I live in Alberta where we're the beef capital of Canada really (by quality of not quantity, Ontario might produce more beef, but they corn feed, ours is grass fed, tastier) a nice steak at the grocery store starts at $30+.... And that's to cook it yourself.\n\nA whole roast chicken (precooked, not charcoal, but electric oven) at a grocery store will run $14 (~570p)\n\n\nSorry, this reply got really long. Hehe I get the general understanding of Tagalog (more Cebuano), but I am not fluent at all unfortunately. I'm white, married to a Filipina for nearly 20 years now.",

As in the transference cure in psychoanalysis, the women are sucking up a part of the men's ego and that gives them the illusion of being in control.\"\n\n> In other words, getting involved with violent men makes them feel stronger. They can then transcend feelings of vulnerability and poor self-appraisal. That much empowerment makes them feel more vital. Add the fantasy that they are truly loved or are being truly loving, and this connection can become an addictive drive.\n\n> Isenberg also notes that a \"large percentage were raised as Catholics and were severely affected by church teachings, including sexism, subjugation of women, and repressions of sexuality.\" She also writes that their fathers were often missing, withdrawn, or abusive, and the mothers might have been demanding. Many of these serial killer groupies also had poor relationships or marriages.",

Lots of people in the rest of the world, if pushed, will read.\n\nIt takes half an hour of critical thinking and reputable research to understand what illiterate lunatics these people on the street are.\n\nBritish people generally hate politicians. Even the ones they voted for. Around half of Brits hate the Royal Family too. Myself included. They are dictators/dynasties and should be gotten rid of in every corner of the world. \n\nMarcoses, Dutertes, Windsors - it's not a sporting competition. They are not our heroes.\n\nThe deification of a murderer doesn't make the Philippines look great. Not sure how that's so hard to understand - but clearly it is.\n\nFurther, the idea that the relatively castrated modern monarchy would make big decisions like this and destroy the legitimacy of the ICC, designed to protect world citizens of off the charts abuse in their home countries, would strategically be a colossal fuck-up for the stability of the already wobbly system.\n\nWhat on Earth would Charles say, \"Well, even though the Philippines voluntarily signed the Rome Statute in 2000 that was meant to protect citizens against mass extrajudicial killings, taking the extrajudicial killer from his home country was wrong. \n\nI say this even though not doing that takes the I out of ICC. Send him back. Have another 30,000 on us Rodrigo! Pinoy pride!\"\n\nGet the fuck off Facebook!",
