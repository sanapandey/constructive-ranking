Also really cheap, really safe, progressive, modern, and it just makes you think about some things in life you took as rock solid fact..  You see a different approach to life in the most minute of ways and scenarios, and it can lead to significant realizations.  \n\nIt's relaxing to take in new cultures and alternate approaches to life in a way.  It shows you that there is another way, in a way you might not have been expecting.  It shows you new options.  I think it helps you get through life a bit easier, as you're able to tackle the issues in front of you from different angles instead of just always the same 2 dimensional attack from the back.",

But when I realized I was actively struggling with my mental health I took a super pragmatic approach.\n\nI work out between 3-4 times a week and I don't play about that. Even if I just walk on a treadmill for an hour, it helps so much (which sucks because I hate working out lol). I started an office job and had stopped going to the gym for about a year and that was when my mental health took the steepest decline.\n\nThe endorphins do make a difference idc what anyone says. We aren't meant to sit around 9 hours a day.\n\nI make a point of going outside twice during my workday bc my office doesn't have windows (lol) and lack of Vitamin D will fuck your brain up.\n\nI have a journal and do a ton of stream of conscious writing no matter how cringe or ridiculous or self-pitying the thought is I write it down, it feels better to just get it out of your system.\n\nI also pick up art projects, I crochet/yoyo/color/doodle. I have a bunch of activities I do that allow you to zone out and it feels meditative.\n\nI push ignore on SM content that makes me upset. I block pages that are all doomer etc. I did all I could do to keep the world from getting like this. There's no use in me crashing out every other day because half the country can't think critically.",

Some studies also showed self love practices, like journaling, talking to one self in the mirror, and treating yourself as if you were a family member or someone you love (so you aren\u2019t an arsehole to yourself) can grow to help your self esteem. \n\nIt\u2019s not that it\u2019ll get rid of it, or that one won\u2019t experience depression, but these things are the best natural medicine for depression (at least from the studies I read)",

I had originally moved to Maine to live with my best friend but due to a sudden pregnancy I had to move and find my own place. This situation led to me becoming very depressed over the span of a year or so. It was at that point in my life I hit rock bottom and quit my job deciding it would be better to end it all rather then continue on the way I was going. I picked a small spot next to a river, it was some kind of reserve and it was beautiful. I had picked that place mostly because it was still the off season so no one would be there. I sat in my car with a rifle staring out at the river and trying to pull the trigger, when an older man driving a truck pulled up not too far from my car. I immediately panicked and put the rifle down out of view, thinking that if he called the cops I would end up in a mental hospital. I planned to just wait for him to leave since most people who would come by tended to take a few pictures and leave, but he didn't do that. Instead he began to unload wood from his truck for fencing. I couldn't believe my luck...on that day at that time this man just had to be here. The man proceeded to start repairing a fence that just happened to be in complete view of my car. After a while I completely lost my nerve and ended up leaving. That day was a turning point in my life. I now look back and think just how lucky I was to have been saved by his presence and I don't even know who he was but I will never forget him for the rest of my life.",

If you are suicidal, you need extra intervention and should reach out for help because it\u2019s too big to have to cope with alone. I\u2019ve had two close family members who have been suicidal, one who made multiple attempts.\n\nWith my depression, there have been days and long periods when nothing kept me going and I couldn\u2019t even get out of bed. Knowing in the back of my head that my depression is cyclical and things will get better makes things tolerable when I\u2019m at my worst. My family, especially my kids, make me want to get better. I think sometimes depression is just chemical or hormonal and it\u2019s not a matter of motivation. Medication has helped and so has managing my stress levels.\n\nMy dog and knowing he depends on me to walk him, feed him, and care for him has helped establish a routine. Getting outside even for a short walk makes a big difference. Getting sunlight early in the morning, if possible. Little things like buying tickets to a concert so I have something to look forward to. Lots of baby steps can add up and make a difference. Not thinking about how overwhelming it all is and just focusing on one little thing a day like \u201cYay! I washed the dishes.\u201d\n\nThere have been times when nothing helped.

            "body": "I\u2019m gonna jump in on the train that says death is the biggest preventer, but I\u2019m gonna elaborate. \n\nI have a form of treatment resistant depression, and I\u2019ve been in therapy for over 20 years. For 17 years in my life, I was in a relationship, and the most important reason preventing my wish to die was to not make my partner sad. When my marriage ended, I was extremely suicidal, but what prevented me at that point was making my family sad. I went on ketamine treatment for two years, which helped keep me stay kind of surface level. \n\nI ended up being medically retired from my career due to my mental health. It was that point that I decided that I was just going to travel. However, my plan was to travel until I ran out of money and when the money ran out, I was going to end it all.\n\nWhat was unexpected was I met someone who I fell in love with when I traveled. That relationship didn\u2019t last all that long, but it was the spark of falling back in deep connection with another human at such a real level, that gave me hope. \n\nTook a few months after that, with some other major life blows and started focusing on myself. When I finally kind of came into my own and had a very relieved feeling of depression (but still not functioning like \u201cnormal\u201d people), I found myself in another relationship with someone who I had met briefly and we talked long distance for a long time. This led for me being the happiest that I\u2019ve been in forever. We finally reconnected in person and dated for a while, and that relationship ended about a month ago. \n\nI\u2019m still traveling and I\u2019m almost out of money, but the thing is, I no longer want to die. What I managed to prove to myself, while running through my life savings, is that life presents wonderful things at random moments and there are so many just amazing things and experiences that I\u2019ve had that I wouldn\u2019t have had if I killed myself.\n\nI\u2019m still very depressed and honestly feeling the worst that I have felt in a long time, because of the end of my last relationship that had instilled hope, but the thing is is I don\u2019t feel like giving up the same this time. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do financially I don\u2019t know how to get my mind right in order to be a functioning member of society in the same way again, but what I did realize is that my values do not coincide with the society in which I exist back home I realize that there are so many great things in life just don\u2019t exist where I\u2019m from, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not out there. So now my job going forward is gonna be to just figure out how to make things work, because the good things tend to find me when I allow them to, and the biggest way for me to not allow them to would be for me to remove myself. \n\nSo I\u2019m not going to quit anymore. I\u2019m not going to resign myself to death to which I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s an afterlife. I\u2019m not going to allow the rules of the world which I was born into to control my life and just keep me down. I\u2019m going to keep going out there and looking to pave my own way like I have for the last few years and I\u2019m sure the other good things will find me.\n\nI have been extremely risk-averse which is caused both phenomenal payoffs and horrible mistakes and I only lived that way because I didn\u2019t care what happened. That has also told me just to maybe say yes to a little more things and be a little less worried about shit. Because realistically my worst case scenario is a part of my brain\u2019s best case scenario so what do I have to lose by just going out there and trying to find something that will make me want to wake up every day",

It reminded me of an 80's horror movie)\n\nCreatures - Awakened by James S. Murray ( I don't want to say more and spoil it)\n\nSpace \"creatures\" (not stereotypical aliens) - The Last Astronaut by David Wellington\n\nSharks - The Meg by Steve Alten (better than the movie for sure)\n\nPrehistoric creatures - The Loch & Vostok by Steve Alten\n\nGorillas - Congo by Michael Crichton\n\nUndisturbed ecosystem - Fragment by Warren Fahy\n\nDemons/supernatural - Ararat & Pandora Room by Christopher Golden\n\nCreatures - Annihilation (the entire Southern Reach Trilogy) by Jeff Vandermeer (they released the movie a few years ago I think; I haven't seen it yet. The first book is good, and the last 2 are subpar).\n\nSquid - The Beast by Peter Benchley (he also wrote Jaws) \n\nPhantoms by Dean Koontz (not sure how to describe it, but Affleck was da bomb in the movie, lol)\n\nThe Ridge by Michael Koryta. I went into it thinking it was a ghost story but it totally went a different but amazing way. Really emotional but definitely worth it. \n\nSub-Zero by Matt James. It's set on a research vessel near Antarctica. Off the coast of McMurdo Station, in the frigid waters of the Southern Ocean, a new species of Antarctic octopus is unintentionally discovered. \n\nSubterranean by James Rollins or The Maw by Taylor Zajonc (both involve undiscovered caves and their unique ecosystems).\n\nHopefully this helps a bit!

I try to be extra nice with myself and remember how I'll just have to go back to the tutorial mode: how to breath, how to wake up, Shower, etc. If it doesn't work I tricked my brain to do self-harm that's actually good for me ( ex: cold baths)\n\nI accepted my messed up brain and when it's going very badly, I'm trying to do as much as I can in this moment. If it's just to go fetch water or wash one cup, I'll try. And if it's too much, I tried and there are days like this.",
