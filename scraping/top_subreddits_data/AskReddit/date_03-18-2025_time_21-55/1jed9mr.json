Donate to a charity, volunteer for a charity, call or write to your government, etc. But in order to avoid hopelessness, I think avoiding constant news coverage is key. It feels bad to ignore atrocities, but if you're actually doing what you can, it's at least something for your conscience.",

If I were sitting in Poland or Syria or Nigeria right now, my opinion would be very different. \n\nAs an American, the best we can do is provide a credible deterrent for our adversaries, and be willing to provide assistance to our allies and friends. I was a big believer in Obama. I thought, under the right circumstances, everyone can be reasoned with and talked out of the use of violence. I no longer believe that. Some people, some cultures, only respect the credible threat of retaliation. The more friends we have who can asssist us in that guarantee, the safer the world is. \n\nThat\u2019s why maintaining the alliances necessary to really bloody Putin for his aggression in Ukraine will make China\u2019s invasion of Taiwan less likely. \n\nOf course, we elected Trump who appears to be negotiating our surrender of Ukraine right now. Taiwan will be next. Then god only knows.",

Right wing ideologies often if not always revolve around the idea that one set of actions is superior to another set of actions. And that this process of superior or inferior actions is part of a net competition for limited opportunity to survive\n\nIn that an entity is able to make actions independently of its environment and other entities. And that its decision making process is inherent to its own survival. \n\nThis has formed the groundwork of every genocide in human history. \n\nPeople often argue that left wing governments commit atrocities too. While this is true, the definition of genocide is \n\n\"Genocide is violence that targets individuals because of their membership of a group and aims at the destruction of a people.\u00a0Raphael Lemkin, who first coined the term, defined genocide as \"the destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group\" by means such as \"the disintegration of [its] political and social institutions, of [its] culture, language, national feelings, religion, and [its] economic existence\".\u00a0During the struggle to ratify the Genocide Convention, powerful countries restricted Lemkin's definition to exclude their own actions from being classified as genocide, ultimately limiting it to any of five \"acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\".\n \nCertain political philosophies are abstract to the concept of things like genocide as they do not seek to draw definitions along lines of race, nationality, language, religion or ethnicity. For example \n\n\"I wish to exterminate all bankers\" is not by definition a genocide as bankers do not represent a national, religious, ethnic or racial group. The same could be said of any other grouping that does not represent a national identity, religion, race or ethnicity. \n\nMost left wing philosophies preclude the distinguishing of people via religious, cultural, ethnic or national means. And in fact in most truly left wing ideologies. The idea of a \"genocide\" is antithetical to the basic philosophy of equality that is proposed by most left wing philosophies. \n\nNormally if you find a group that persecutes and uses power to coerce specific minorities they would be right wing. (A group that uses power to coerce everyone not in power into a minority is authoritarian, but not nessesarily right or left wing)\n\nOfc if what your saying is that your not intentionally ignorant to genocide, and that you have done certain things to voice your concern to those around you and incharge of the power structures you find yourself in. \n\nThen you wouldn't be complicit. Merely unable to make a difference. Which if that is the case one should ask, why that might be. And in which type of power structure is it that you live?",

You're allowed to have feelings, needing to cope means you're struggling with those feelings. That's an issue.\n\nHow many people died in the world yesterday? How many were innocent and for some reason other than old age related issues? Do you know the number? Who were they? What were their names? What do you know about them?\n\nI could invent a story about some kid who suffered and died yesterday and you would feel empathy towards this kid who isn't even real. That's normal, and despite the kid not being real, just as valid as if he were, because your feelings aren't really about ***that*** kid, it's empathy towards a concept, an abstraction, towards the very notion of kids suffering.\n\nYou should have feelings, opinions, and so on, but those feelings should be the same whether the events were happening or not, as with the invented kid story. *All* events you're not experiencing, including those you'll never hear about, should be on equal footing in how you feel about them.\n\nThe fact that someone could show you pictures of one person at a time and tell you their tragedies to spike your empathy for each one over the 99.99% you don't know about is a normal reaction, but if that leaves you struggling to find ways to \"cope\", yes, you have an emotional regulation problem, as it's now inherently true that you would have the same struggle if someone was feeding you entirely imaginary events.\n\nEdit: As an example, this comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jed9mr/comment/mii4887](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jed9mr/comment/mii4887)\n\n>I really needed to read this.

There are also tons of great things going on. 8 billion is a really, really big number. \n\nLiving through COVID and 9/11 really impressed upon me how arbitrary our reactions to other people's tragedies can be. When the terrorists killed 3,000 people on 9/11, we collectively got mad, sad, and united in our reaction. In early 2021, I think we were losing a 9/11 worth of Americans to COVID every week or so. Mostly the reaction was pretty muted compared to 9/11. \n\nThere are reasons for the disparate reaction. With 9/11, there were human enemies we could get mad at. And it was one point in time versus an ongoing issue. But I don't think those differences make the intensity of our reaction any less arbitrary. Lots of people die for lots of reasons on any given day. Our brains aren't wired to react to all of that information in any coherent sort of way.",

Maybe you're not directly involved in the massacre of thousands right now. Maybe you just sit on the panel that moves funding to non-registered foreign agents.

Maybe you're just a diabetic, or a senior. Maybe you're just a kid in a classroom.\n\nAll of these people have become victims in some weird fucked-up villainous story. It's hard enough to just try and look at that story, and try to wrap your head around it as anything OTHER than fiction. We're here because we want to be here (or, at least, enough of us do that we have arrived here). We CHOSE the fiction. We let the hairbrained writers of absolute LUNACY (or, in the slightly less severe instance: irreparable idiocy) become our lobbyists, military alliances, opulently rich, police, spiritual leaders, and governing body. We let it happen. \n\nNow we read & see about shootings, bombings,  preventable deaths, immense suffering, power dynamics, dehumanization, frenzied failure of any redeemable depth of thought, and lab-level cultivation of hate. \n\nIt's so fucked up to think about that. It makes my head feel like it's about to short out.\n\nThen, a long with all that, my own life (blessedly removed from any active bloody warzones) is just being held to the fire right now in so many ways. \n\nSo I guess I'm not coping. \nI'm failing to do so.\n\nThis shit is CATEGORICALLY ABSURD. \nAnd the fact that we continue to shepherd this fucking bloodlust clownshow of a world into enduring existence, despite ALL the tools and capabilities to just plainly do otherwise, is nothing short of the saddest thing I think humanity can collectively experience.\n\nI don't even have social media anymore. It helps slightly, but it's not even close to getting me to wrapping my mind around how. the fuck. we continue. to. allow. this.\n\nI've tried checking out with the big S before.

Humanity hurting humanity has always been a thing. The ways in which conflict, whether it be as small as interpersonal relationship problems (relative to terrorism, that is) or as extreme as the violations of human rights, all of this is due to the fact that the psychology of people is not where it should be. It's not in a healthy place. It's fused with sickness that people do not even see within themselves and many will never even explore it. People with suffering psyches, whether they navigate the world with their own psyche or with a group psyche, will bring dehumanisation and terrorism in many forms. It might then be said that the wars that happen today are merely a result of unaddressed issues of a psychological kind. War would not happen if everyone was able to recognise and fully understand the humanity of others. It's those who are suffering who will make others suffer. I could only wish people would look inwards so as to be able to see their own humanity and as a result see the humanity in all human beings. But they will not do that. It is lifelong work and requires being able to shake hands with shame and make friends with all that has been repressed.",

Otherwise you'll spend too much time worrying about something that's happening on the other side of the world while neglecting the actual things that are present in your world (personal relationships, jobs/career, loans, managing your time and hobbies, kids, etc.)\n\nAs for the endless debates, honestly that's just a product of modern day democracy, where it's literally impossible to get one guy to just come in and get shit done, because everything has to be 'discussed' first.

A slight slippage of subterranean stone that obliterates 20,000 people in some far-off land, the ceaseless plundering of virgin jungles in the Amazon basin, a swarm of helpless stars being swallowed up one after another by a ravenous black hole, even an ongoing collision between two huge galaxies each of which contains a hundred billion stars - such colossal events are so abstract to someone like me that they can't even touch the sense of urgency and importance, and thus the reality, of some measly little hangnail on my left hand's pinky.\n\nWe are all egocentric, and what is realest to each of us, in the end, is ourself. The realest things of all are my knee, my nose, my anger, my hunger, my toothache, my sideache, my sadness, my joy, my love for math, my abstraction ceiling, and so forth.\n\nWhat all these things have in common, what binds them together, is the concept of \"my\", which comes out of the concept of \"I\" or \"me\", and therefore, although it is less concrete than a nose or even a toothache, this \"I\" thing is what ultimately seems to each of us to constitute the most solid rock of undeniability of all.\n\nCould it possibly be an illusion? Or if not a total illusion, could it possibly be less real and less solid than we think it is? Could an \"I\" be more like an elusive, receding, shimmering rainbow than like a tangible, heftable, transportable pot of gold?\n\nDouglas Hofstadter, 2007",

Because your behavior chains together with others and eventually connects you to truly despicable, horrible behaviors. You buy a shirt, store got shirt from supplier, supplier used slave labor to assemble cotton, and a warlord killed people to take the cotton field.  If you are fully morally responsible for everything you do, then in this case you are a slave owner and murderer and therefore should destroy yourself.\n\nEveryone implicitly agrees to have a certain amount of dissonance for these things. People have different amounts, and often don\u2019t even hold themselves to a standard level, constantly changing. But nobody in the world has none, because they\u2019d very quickly destroy themselves. Consciously or unconsciously, everyone you know has already confronted this issue and settled on a certain level of dissonance that works for them. \n\nNow you are aware that there is suffering, and you have been employing dissonance to survive. You have a chance to consciously examine your own contradictions here and maybe alter your behavior to a level you find more satisfactory. What that is, I don\u2019t know.

No sense in torturing oneself over something so drastically out of one's control.\n\nThing #3: This may seem callous but, building on Thing #1, people die every day. And although some of it is undoubtedly tragic, it is also the way of things. One cannot hold oneself accountable for all the ills of the world.\n\nWhat one can do is strive to live as virtuously as possible. While one cannot stop all the worlds ills, strive not to add to them. Strive to have an overall possitive impact on one's corner of existence.

But in situations like these, there can be a well-intentioned desire to step in and help, but ones presence may do more harm than good. So much depends on the situation, what skills and temperament we have; what can we realistically offer, and are we meant to interfere and engage or not? Overall, I believe we are all suffering in the knowledge of what we humans are doing to one another, to the planet, to other species, and so on... even if we bury this knowledge to a depth where we feel safe(r). But we're all connected, whether we like to think so or not. I do believe though that as the saying goes, 'it's better to light a candle than to curse the darkness'.

There has never been a time on earth when humans were not killing each other, with innocent people being caught in the middle. You are no different from any other human that lived through these things, the only difference is that our technology now allows you to know some of what is happening. The fact that this effects you is *good* \\- it means you have empathy, and compassion. These are some of the hardest traits to live with, and something that people these days are trained out of expressing. The only issue of course is how much that empathy can cost you every day.\n\nRemind yourself that the 24 hour news cycle wants to sell misery - all that is in the world is not just the bloodshed being pushed from every screen. There is far more happening in the world, far more good happening all over the globe than will ever be covered by the 'news'. If you want to add to that good it will only make you feel better. Even if its something small, helping others near you is the easiest and best way to fight the misery back.",
