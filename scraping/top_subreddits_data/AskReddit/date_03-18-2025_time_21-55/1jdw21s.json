Swapped onto a new bus in El Paso later that night and it was packed. As I was walking towards the back a gal around my age moved her bag out of the chair next to her and motioned for me to sit next to her. Me being a dude in my 20s and her being really pretty made it a no brainer. We spent a good portion of the ride just taking about anything and everything; cars, video games, music, you name it.\n\n At this point it's around 2 am and everyone around us is trying to get some sleep. She gets close to my ear suddenly and asks \"can I suck your dick?\" I laugh it off and ask here? She nods as she starts digging through her back, then she pulls out a fleece blanket. She says \"I'll cover up and nobody will notice.\" At this point I my ears are pretty much ringing but I didn't want to tell her no, and I certainly didn't want to miss out on the opportunity so I just leaned back and as she went down on me I helped her get my pants undone. \n\nAfter she finished she grabbed some gum and a bottle of water out of her bag and started carrying on the conversation we were having before like nothing ever happened. She got off the bus in Texarkana and I never saw her again.",

That one happens to reach out to me to \"check on me\" not long after the break up. We keep talking for a few weeks and things start getting flirty. In a moment of weakness, against my better judgement, we end up hooking up. I feel bad about it so we stop talking, and I also realize how shitty of an older sister she actually was, because it would've absolutely upset her sister (my ex) if she ever found out. The kicker? I found out later a big reason my ex broke up with me, was because she was basically gaslit and manipulated by that sister into thinking I was a shitty boyfriend. She ruined her little sister's relationship just to sleep with her boyfriend (me).",

The only people who were supposed to drive forklifts were employees who worked in the lumber area or in receiving, i.e. areas with a lot of need for pallets and large, heavy items. So if we needed one of our pallets of overstock down for restocking, we had to request one of them to go get it. After enough times of waiting for hours for them to get the pallet (or sometimes forget about it), I just decided one day that I had seen them do it enough times that it couldn't be that hard. So I started grabbing my own pallets down after hopping on a forklift if there was one available. I was right, it wasn't that hard. Nobody ever said anything to me and I even started getting requests from people in other departments to grab their pallets down when I was on it. I always figured if management had a problem with it, I would point out that that it's inefficient to have to wait around to restock an empty shelf because there was no one who was \"certified\" available to get it for me.",

Coming from rather traditional families, we both basically hurled ourselves out of there before any of our horny seniors and freshies could their hands on us. We spent the night at a nearby McDonalds and talked, but the scene of seeing our seniors just openly fucking kept replaying in our mind. At around, I think 3am or so, we practically couldn't contain ourselves and just had sex with each other in the same McDonalds toliet stall. We promised not to talk about it nor to each other after that, but days later, we practically couldn't keep our hands off each other. Then, for the next whole four years of our university life, I had this strange sexual relationship with her that was so dangerously irresponsible I have no idea how she didn't get pregnant. Then, on graduation day, we looked at one another one last time, shook hands, and went back to our own countries. I have never contacted her once since, but I still keep this thing a secret from my parents. Why it ended this way, you ask, that's the confession, I have no idea. We just had this strange, quiet brain sync agreement.",

Both my parents were technically inept. \n\nI was extra cautious, covered my tracks and was never caught per-se. \n\nOne afternoon my mother (attempting to check email) complains about an enormous amount of pop ups and dialers flooding the screen of our PC. I hadn't used the computer for \"activities\" in at least a week, so I'm kinda concerned and curious. \n\nComputer had 10-15 dialer programs filling the desktop. Every time you opened a browser the computer wanted to explode. \n\nMy dad comes in, visibly shaken and very nervous. Deflects any questions and tells my mom that he'll have me look at it. \n\nI end up fixing everything, and without another word - he says \" I owe you.\"\n\nTLDR my dad visited a bunch of sketchy porn sites and nearly grenaded our PC.",

My dad has this habit of knocking once then opening the door immediately anyway, so he does just that, opens the door, full view of my gf sitting on my face (rest of her clothes still on) immediately turns around and just says \"dinners ready\" loudly as he walked out.

Rumors spread, and they questioned us, but we denied it.\n\nThe questioning was more about them trying to get us to admit it. They caught us slacking too many times to not know what was going on.\n\nBut anyways, that\u2019s where the shame comes from. It\u2019s been years, and while I look back and wish it didn\u2019t happen, it happened. And my family knows it happened, no matter how much I wish they could forget it all.\u00a0\n\nEDIT: I forgot to answer whether or not she feels shame about it. The answer is I don\u2019t know. We rarely talk to each other now, as we\u2019ve both moved to different states. And whenever we do talk, it\u2019s never about that period of our lives.",

I was not allowed to have friends so how to act around other adults was foreign to me.\n        Cut to our first time hanging out.  She takes me to a bug museum in New Orleans.  Seems normal until we get to an interactive movie exhibit.  The seats vibrate.  She leans over and whispers in my ear that I should roll my hips forward.  That these vibrations never fail to get her off.  I'm surprised at her comment but brush it off.  After  we walk around Jackson Square holding hands. Ro me this is just what friends must do.\n        The rest of summer was late nights of watching movies together while making out, dry humping and sucking each other's breasts\n         As summer comes to an end she tells me she wants to stay in a fancy hotel downtown together since our time together is coming to an end.  We dress up and go out to eat.  Then come back to room shower then hang out in the room in our fluffy robes and drink champagne.  I end up passing out because I'm not allowed to drink at home.  \n      I awaken in the middle of the night to her fully going down on me and man does it feel good.  I freak out and ask her what she's doing.  She says that she wants to take our relationship to the next level. I ask her what relationship.  She's taken aback.  I truly didnt know she thought we were in a relationship. I tell her I really enjoy her going down on me but I am a married woman.  I'm conflicted so I call my husband in the middle of the night and tell him everything and ask him if I can continue.  He says no fucking way and your in big trouble when u get home.  I tell her this much.  \n       Over the summer I had trickled the truth about my terrible marriage to her.  I had told her about how I was cut off from family and friends.  How I couldn't leave the house unless it was with my kids.  Not allowed to drink and lastly how I had never had an orgasm. When I had asked my husband about orgasms he said they were for sluts.\n         My sorta girlfriend understands and asks to leave me with a parting gift.  She takes me to the bathroom and tells me she gonna teach me to cum.  She has me lay down on the large hotel bath with my legs up the wall.  She takes down the shower head and gets the water temperature just right. She directs it to the right spot by watching my facial expressions then bam fireworks.  I've been a cumming queen ever since.\n      I go home and file divorce.  A bitter and scary year later and I was officially free.  Remarried now to my king. And he adores my bedroom slut origin story.",

Not to mention all the public toilets (we would try to pick clean ones, to be fair).\n\nOne time I got horribly smashed in a mountain cabin. Went into a work shed with two gay guys to check out some carvings, ended up sucking the guys dicks right there in the cold. Got complimented for having a great dick myself (apparently). They offered sex, but I was a gay virgin and I had hemorhoids, so I declined. They said I should at least watch, but I was too embarrassed at that point. I then went to puke, returned to my situationship in bed saying: oh yeah, I sucked your friends dicks by the way, then fell asleep on the spot. \n\n  \nCan't decide which one is more nsfw honestly, probably the first, make me sound like a sex pest",

One night on my new journey of self discovery I got hot and heavy with myself while the parents were away for the weekend. Since I was still new to this whole thing I coudn't tell that instead of semen what was actually rushing to the surface was piss... in my search for quick pleasure as an adolesent I was instead greeted by a fire hose of piss which I struggled to control and subsequently had to watch in horror as I sprayed the floor, tv, and walls.  Needless to say I was thankful I had a weekend to clean.",

            "body": "My sex life with my wife is dying a slow death and I don't know how much longer I can live with it without leaving. It all started when she got pregnant and had our son. Things naturally dropped off for a while and admittedly I pressured her some for sex but it was driving me crazy only having sex once a month or so for the first year and a half of our son's life. Things got better for a while and we were having sex every 2-3 days and really enjoying it and then she started developing some sort of autoimmune condition and things have slowly dwindled to the point we are now where we have sex maybe 3x a month max and maybe once is it actually enjoyable. Most of the time she doesn't really want any kissing, doesn't want me to go down on her, doesn't want me to touch most of her body, etc. it's not terribly enjoyable but it's also hard for me to turn down when the alternative is getting nothing.\n\nI think part of the problem is she has a lot of days where she feels crappy and on the days where she feels good she would rather spend time doing hobbies she enjoys and can't do every day that aren't sex so I end up mostly getting pity sex on days she's feeling bad. Blowjobs and things are also almost entirely off the table these days and they are terrible and usually require me to finish myself after 30 seconds of her going down on me when they do happen.\n\nI've tried talking to her about it but she doesn't really want to hear it and just thinks I'm pressuring her for more sex, which isn't entirely wrong, but I'd be less concerned about the frequency if it were more enjoyable. I'm doing my best to just bide my time and focus on her well being and hope her doctors can figure something out and in the meantime enjoying other aspects of my life so I don't dwell on this but it's getting harder and harder as time goes on.\n\nTBH part of what's made things difficult is that I've been going to the gym a lot trying to better myself and I guess in some ways hoping getting in better shape and more attractive might make her more interested in me and while it's had some mild effects on her I've been getting a lot more attention from other women, more than any time in my life.\n\nI feel pretty terrible that I feel this way towards her when she's got this illness going on, and I know it would destroy our son, but sex has been a big part of our relationship and my life in general since I was about 15 and it's hard to just be OK with m having a lot less of it. Before anyone asks she would never go for me having a FWB or something on the side and it would almost certainly be the end of our marriage if I floated the idea. I also won't be cheating on her, I'd leave the marriage before that happens but every time I get some attention from an attractive woman I can't help but think of the fun I could be having \n\nI don't even know why I wrote all this. I might delete it but there's no one I can really talk to about it so I post on reddit",

            "body": "Sex for women is extremely mental, and if a guy is coming across as almost desperate to fuck it\u2019s a huge turn off (not saying you are, but women can usually tell when a guy is itching for it) Women are also pretty intuitive, if you\u2019re thinking about other women, it\u2019s probably noticed and taking a tole. Id say she\u2019s probably feeling insecure especially if you\u2019re getting in shape, and that she can\u2019t please you makes it worse. While not all women are the same, there is quite a few you could catch ready spicy books and I\u2019ll help you out with some of the why. Usually these books involve a guy that is obsessed with the girl and there\u2019s different kinds, some are sweet, some are playboys blah blah, but usually the guy then starts pining for the girl and basically gives her the best times of her life. Why this matters? If you want her, show her. Notice the things she does, compliment her efforts, and remind her how attracted to her you are. Get her more interested throughout the day by doing small things ex) come up from behind her to grab her, run your fingers down her and then through her hair. Give her the tingles throughout the day with small things, whisper dirty things in her ear and then walk away. Remember it\u2019s a tease, so keep it short and hot. As for initiating sex, don\u2019t go the sweet and sensual super kissy touchy lovey dovey route. Push her to the wall with your hand on her throat kiss her passionately but not for long and then take her to the bed. And by take her to the bed, don\u2019t give an option, pick her up and then throw her down on the bed cause you mean business. Start undressing her and get to work. Go down on her, don\u2019t ask just do. Now of course no means no, so if she\u2019s not having it then do not by any means push yourself on her. But if she seems into the more aggressive route, don\u2019t waste time on the kissing pregame bs just get down to it and leave her shaking. Make sure your wife sees how much you love, support and want her. Don\u2019t hesitate to give her a massage if she says her back hurts, if she\u2019s craving something go get it, if she is having a lazy day, be the productive one. Hope it helps!",

But alcohol was there so we stayed. After we ate the chicken, everyone went home. (It was the paraplegic's house.) We drank with her and played some music, bullshitted. Then I take my buddy to the bathroom and I'm like \"yo, I bet she'll suck your dick if you ask her\" he says \"nah man. I couldn't.\" And I egg him on. He musters up the courage to do it, I stay back in the bathroom to give him some time. After a few minutes, I look out the bathroom door and he's sitting on the counter getting his dick sucked. Lol. He looks back at me like \"it worked!\" So I walk over to the other side and whip out my dick and she starts sucking us both off one by one. She grabs my dick like she's the incredible hulk with an iron fist grip. My buddy tries to get his dick sucked again but she refuses his and says she wants mine. So I let her do her thing. Eventually it all stops. I didn't cum or anything but apparently my buddy did. In her mouth. And I didn't know and I kissed her afterwards. Lol. I didn't like taste jizz or anything (not that I know what jizz tastes like anyway). We go back to drinking, listening to music.\n\n(Side story: my buddy knocked her out of her wheel chair that night by being too rough with her chair while she was in it, like fucking around with it. She flopped on the floor and we couldn't get her up. I could see she was ashamed of herself atm so I lied down on the floor next to her and we waited there together until the firemen showed up to get her back in the chair.)\n\nI take a shot of fireball and puke my ass off in the backyard. When the night died down, she went into her room. I followed after but she said she wanted to be alone for a minute. (Probably to take off her diaper and clean herself. Idk. Just my assumption). She calls me in and we get into bed together. I suck on her titties and we make out. I start to move my hand towards her vagina but she asks me what am I doing, so I take it back and say idk. I just like the feel of pussy so I wanted to touch it but I didn't. She turned the light off and asked if we could just cuddle so I did for a few minutes before I told her I'd be right back.\n\nI went out of the room and my buddy and I went to go sleep in the spare bedroom. He was on the floor, I took the bed. My buddy woke up earlier than me so he was out in the living room when some people came by the apartment. They asked him who he is and what is he doing there. Then he replies with, let's say my name is Tucker. He says \"Tucker is in the other room\" lol. Like thanks, bro for calling me out. Anyway, we dip out soon after that and him and I discuss wtf happened that night and we both agreed that our walk was a walk of shame.\n\nNot saying every night was like that but it seemed that every time my buddy and I drank together, crazy shit like that would happen.",

            "body": "The first time I ever fingered a girl I was in year 8 at high school. I was in the classroom and we had a substitute teacher that day. The class was mayhem and the teacher had absolutely no control, we\u2019d had that same teacher before and she wasn\u2019t very bright and all the students new it. I was sitting next to this girl, let\u2019s call her Tanya.. \n\nTanya and I were kind of flirting and making fun of each other when I put my hand up and asked the teacher if she could help my friend with her school work just to mess with her. I told her, \u201cshe\u2019s too shy to ask you herself\u201d. Through clenched teeth and under her breath Tanya discreetly threatened, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you at lunch time\u201d. The teacher came and pulled up a chair at our desk and sat opposite us and asked, \u201cwhat do you need help with?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s having trouble with that section,\u201d I replied pointing to her page. The teacher then proceeded to help her but then Tanya started to play along trolling the teacher with stupid questions and acting like she was really dumb. \n\nMy prank wasn\u2019t going to plan so I sneakily put my hand on Tanya\u2019s knee under the table as a joke. I was looking at the page where the teacher was trying to explain the work pretending nothing else was happening, I then looked at Tanya\u2019s face and she didn\u2019t even flinch. Hmmm\u2026 I wasn\u2019t expecting this reaction. I also had never touched a girls leg before. I don\u2019t know what it was but I felt so confident, I slid my hand up her leg a couple of inches. Her knees were slightly together but as my hand slid up I felt her legs open a little as if inviting me further. The desks were really big tables and we were sitting at the back so no one could see what was going on. Students were all yelling and throwing stuff around the class room and moving around so everyone seemed completely distracted. I waited a couple more minutes and gained more confidence. I slid my hand up a little further and looked at Tanya\u2019s face, she didn\u2019t look at me once. She was casually asking the teacher more stupid (and kinda funny) questions and nodding her head agreeing and then acting confused by the work. I got nervous and stopped moving my hand up further but then suddenly I felt Tanya\u2019s hand touch my hand and thought to myself she was going to push it away. To my surprise she gently took my hand and guided it further up the inside of her thigh. She then let go and used the same hand to start pointing at her page again talking to the teacher. Tanya spread her legs as much as she could with her left leg pressed right up against the side of my right leg. I creeped my hand up a little more and felt the edge of her underwear and slowly pulled it aside. She was extremely wet. I started to finger her slowly under the desk, I saw her breathing change but she kept it together so the teacher wouldn\u2019t notice. I couldn\u2019t believe it. My first time fingering a girl ever. \n\nA week later I was at a house party and I fingered Tanya again in the bathroom. I asked her to be my girlfriend and we dated for 4 months. I ate her out every chance I got but she never returned any favours to me. I think she just really enjoyed the pleasure but we were young and she didn\u2019t seem ready for anything else and I was also too immature to ask or even have conversations about what we were doing so I didn\u2019t pressure her, I just figured out what she was ok with and did that on repeat. I eventually broke up with her as things didn\u2019t seem to be progressing and she dated a new boy a week later and had sex with him just to get back at me.",

I also had a girlfriend in my last two years of high school. The BJ habit carried into my college days when we had a sauna where guys gathered for a quickie after working out. I recall being in that sauna with no fewer than eight erect guys at once. Today, I prefer to pair bond with women. However, I have had a few guy-guy encounters here and there.\n\nI believe many more guys have sex with men that care to admit it. For instance, Grindr blows up at CPac.  I believe there is absolutely nothing wrong with sexual relations between enthusiastic and consenting adults. Guys are likelier to share a random encounter and not think twice about it.",

I then put a couple sponges inside, and finally a glove (thoroughly washed to get that stupid powder out of it) that I would use as a condom and change every time. The best thing was that it was just about the size of a tube-shaped piggy bank I had, that had incidentally also been full since long before this. So every time I would just remove the sponges and the glove, put a few coins inside and store it away in plain sight, pretending it was a second piggy bank. I doubt anyone ever suspected anything.",

She was also bipolar and it got extremely stressful to be around her. The longer we were together the worse it was. However, the sex was incredible. She was big into the kink scene in our city, and through that I ended up meeting a number of her friends in that scene as well. Including two of her best friends, also goth girls, that she spent most of her time with when she wasn't with me. \n\nFast forward, I come home early from work on a Friday and catch her in bed with a guy she'd met at a kink convention. Her best friends were disappointed in her. So much so, they expressed support for me leaving her on the hook for the apartment (she didn't have a job), and no furniture aside from an old couch and folding dinner trays. They also expressed support by visiting me in my new place a week later and giving me my first ever threesome. They did things the ex had hard limits on. The entire experience lasted for three straight days of orgasmic haze. By the end I felt like a wrung out rag. Nothing since then has topped that experience. \n\nAs happens so often when you sleep with an ex's friend, however, one of them talked too much and the ex found out. That was a nightmarish few weeks.

One night, she was over for a visit over dinner and it rained a lot so we couldn't drive her home.\n\nWe watched a movie all night, set up our beddings on the living room, and drank some before we fell asleep. My partner was in the middle and we slept cuddled up while her sister was basically on her own on the other side.\n\nI woke up after a few hours. My eyes were barely open, and I almost couldn't see anything without my glasses on and with the lights off in the living room except a faint night light plugged in the corner.\n\nI felt that my girlfriend wasn't snuggled into me, so I went closer to her, hugged her, and cuddled her. She was turned away from my side, facing left. Then I felt that I wanted to bone her. I started to rub my boner onto her butt and slowly squeezed her breasts over her shirt using my right hand which was wrapped over her.\n\nShe wasn't responding and was still deep in her slumber. I kept squeezing her boobs, still half asleep myself. I was almost about to start working on pulling her pajamas down.\n\nIt was when I heard the toilet flush and a series of coughs from the bathroom that I realized that my girlfriend had actually gotten up at some point before I woke up to use the bathroom.\n\nI immediately retreated back to my position and closed my eyes, realizing the mistake I made. My girlfriend returned to my side, snuggled into me, and we both fell asleep again soon after.\n\nThe following morning, after we woke up, it seems her sister never knew what happened. We had breakfast normally, with no air of awkwardness coming from her. \n\nBut it still haunts me sometimes. It was an honest mistake, I swear.",

My dad asked what I was doing & I said \u201cwatching YT\u201d or something like that lol. Anyways, I text my homie I almost got caught watching by my pops (idk, just bro things) and our phone rings with my teacher leaving a voice message, \u201cyour son was misbehaving in class today\u201d.\n\nAfter an ass whooping my dad took my phone and OF COURSE, READ THROUGH MY TEXTS.

She was really fit with big fake tits that she liked wearing tight shirts to show off. Started off just watching True Blood because we were both into it and it was still coming out on HBO. Her husband was in the Air Force and I was in the Navy but he worked 1 state away and geo bached there during the week. I never had any intention of anything happening but one night I'd been drinking and she asked me to come down to watch True Blood and bring the pitcher of whatever I was drinking (she was pretty religious and I didn't know she drank). After about 2 episodes and multiple drinks she started getting really flirtatious and telling me really specific sexual details like she owned a Sybian and she's only ever squirted once. I was 24, newly single, and horny so I'm basically sitting next to her on the couch fully erect at this point which she clearly could see. Somehow I still had enough blood in my brain to remember that I wouldn't want to do that to her husband who I knew and had a good relationship with plus I could go to court martial for adultery also. I excused myself to go home, she asked for a hug in one last ditch attempt to get me to try something and stay. I did the awkward butt out hug to avoid poking her with my erection. I escaped, went home, and busted the biggest nut of my life (even to today). To this day, I kind of regret not taking her to pound town. \n\nI started seeing another neighbor about a week later who was closer to my age though younger (I am now married to her). The married neighbor found out and came over to my house while I was working on my truck and started yelling at me about how I was robbing the cradle and couldn't date the other girl. She and her husband ended up getting a divorce about a month or two later, I never saw her husband again as he moved away and she stayed in the house. I heard from a gossipy neighbor across the street that she had told her husband that her and I fooled around which wasn't true. I felt bad about that.",

Next thing I know, she gets on her knees and you know what happened next, she eventually had sex while I watched them and enjoyed the show.\n\n\nIt's been about a year from that and we still meet up every few weeks to play.",

Everything was fine. I was changing. I started thinking differently, feeling differently, looking differently, behaving differently in a span of 2 months, then i increased my dosage. By the end of 3rd month it hit me. Girl puberty really hit me. I wanted a boy. It would feel like i was finally coming in terms with my senses, like everything started aligning with me. I was in heat, i was shaking, I really wanted to feel someone strong touching me, hugging me. So i found a stranger that liked trans people, he happened to be 8 years older than me, very gentle, smart, good looking. We spent a day chatting - we liked each other. Then we met. Oh boy, we spent 1 evening together, just walking and talking, getting to know each other better. Then we ended on his place, with a bottle of great wine, a lot of talking, and me having a courage to take his hand and lead us to his bed. I was still shy, i only snuggled to him. Feeling myself in heat, he asked if he may kiss me. I didn\u2019t respond, but my eyes would tell everything he needed to know. He made his move, and this night ended in the best sexual experience i have had in my entire life. Never had i ever felt so feminine, so gorgeous, so me. \n\nThen, after 2 months of our relationship he disappears, only to tell me he happen to have had main girlfriend all along. My heart broken, i\u2019m pissed, i meet him to tell him everything i think of him, but he forced me to blow him with tears on my eyes, my feelings go so deep i get into autopilot to have sex with him, aaand then i hate myself and stop HRT entirely.\n\n2 years later I\u2019m just a normal guy to everyone again. Except for me. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to have HRT again. I was afraid of what i could become if i let it happen to my dearest vulnerable self again.",

I joked about how I've enjoyed taking cock for free and they could line guys up around the corner for turns if it meant it could get a few bucks. I had my \"audition\" on the dining room table of said dealer's house and was on a set a couple weeks later where I filmed 2 scenes. That was the first and only actual \"porno\" I was in. It was unsafe. They didn't know what they were doing. I had a GREAT time, but knew that doing more stuff in the manner they were doing it was going to eventually go badly.

I saw her backpack still sitting there and when nobody noticed, quietly nicked the swimsuit and put it in my bag. \n\nWhich on hindsight was stupid because if she found it missing and my bag was searched, I would be beyond embarassed. But luckily she didn't even realise. When her car arrived she just grabbed her bag and went off. I also excused myself and went home.\n\nJerked off to her swimsuit a couple times then kept it.
