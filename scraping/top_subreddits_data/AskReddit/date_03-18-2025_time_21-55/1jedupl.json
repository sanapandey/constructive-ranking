I like actually learning things and lots of stuff on insta and twitter now is lots of mean comments and racism without any consequences, tik tok wasn\u2019t bad for some stuff but the people like influencers kept popping up all the time on my feed when i never followed them!",

I have not drank in over 100 days and I don\u2019t regret it one bit. My problems did not magically go away and in a lot of ways, I still have a lot of inner work to do. \n\nAs I get deeper into my meditation sessions I\u2019m starting to believe that alcohol and other vices aren\u2019t the problem but the symptom of a deeper rooted problem, which I now believe I am healing.

I used to waste hours a day in my fantasies. It\u2019s caused long-lasting and numerous academic, career and relationship issues. I think for most people it stems from trauma. The mind is protecting itself from a difficult reality by indulging in a safe fantastical world where there\u2019s no harm. The sad thing is that this becomes the default way of thinking, and even when a person moves on from the trauma that caused the MD, the mind can\u2019t. That\u2019s how they learnt to think. \n\nIf anyone is reading this and suffering, please identify your triggers and remove them. For me, it is music with headphones. Listing to music activates my MD. When it starts to happen, I have to be firm and stop myself, and turn off the music. Try to be more social and spend time with people, when you\u2019re engaged in conversations, the mind has to stay alert and has less opportunity to go into daydreams. Find activities that you\u2019re passionate about to train your mind to focus deeply on a subject. Or, activities that require active and deep thinking, like reading. The goal is to train the mind to be alert and engaged. Look at your diet, and incorporate brain healthy food such as eggs and salmon. These things have really helped me.",

It was being surrounded constantly by two-faced, hypocritical, intellectually bankrupt leadership and the constant bad faith practices they would do.  I am convinced that there's nothing we can do to save Western education.  It's a vicious colonial-era design, made by the military to figure out who stands behind the canons and who stands in front.  As the organization of violence in society that we call civilization \"evolved,\" and industrial manufacturing became the new economic model, they found this idea for a school model worked really well to create the necessary slave/working class industrial capitalism requires to exist.  Schools are not for education.  They are for indoctrination into power systems.  And learning is not something to be enjoyed. School exists only to be suffered through and endured.  That's the entire purpose of state and private education.  The kids know it.  They feel it.  But they can't articulate how they're being exploited and systematically intellectually and spiritually destroyed.   So they take on behaviours that you only see in Western schools, and because we all went through that system, we think that's normal behaviour.  \n\nQuitting that world immediately had an effect on me.  It massively reduced the stress.  What I am now left with is an abysmal depression and complete lack of faith in people and society.  We in the modern western world are simply not capable of positive change.  It may be trauma related, but there really is no hope.  So I am living a hair's breadth from poverty and just waiting till I die or the whole thing collapses.  I hope the latter comes first, because it is destined to get really ugly.",

I have some pretty good coping mechanisms I developed and use.  Despite all the training and all the literature we studied and were expected to practice once graduating, the reality is schools do NOT implement those practices.  Despite the advances in adolescent psychology most schools still run on the same behaviour management strategies as the 50's.  Places where reform is introduced, it is handled very badly.  This is largely due to the straight up lack of intelligence in most teachers and leadership.  Teachers in leadership are career teachers, who rolled out of uni straight into teaching.  They have no life experience outside school structures, and so they fail miserably at supporting these reforms.  The reforms themselves are simply band-aid solutions.  The problem is a core structural issue.  Inevitably, these schools end up creating a two-tier system where students that haven't had any issues diagnosed are pushed into the old system while those who do have a diagnosis have free rein and often destroy any education happening in their classroom.  This creates an incredibly toxic culture among the students that begins in primary and defines the rest of their relationship with education.  In the state I live we have the highest illiteracy and innumeracy as a direct result of this.  We've had a conservative government in for decades now, that is very focused on culture-war rhetoric and not actual solutions. \n\nI could write a book, I could make a movie, I could do a YT video.  It would make no difference.  As a society, we do not have the capacity to change this.  There's far too much invested in a system we all know is broken.  This serves the ruling classes very well.  \"I love the poorly educated.\"  \n\nSadly, the best option if you want to get an education is to homeschool.  And we know how bad that is, and how dangerous. But it's much better than the experience of school.  School turns good kids into sadistic, stressed-out, broken, hyper-defensive mental health basket cases.  If you are teacher it needs to do the same to you and you better get on board if you want success.  By success I mean to have a job.  So many teachers I see simply don't teach.  They get quotas and tick boxes and they are very, very good at the game.",

Most are from students you wouldn't let just leave and go to the shops or watch a video on some horrible reality show during class.  You go home every night stressing out, depressed.  You wake up super early and do it all over again.  The system demands you be an arsehole.  There is no other way.  Schools run on a thing I call the economy of misery.  Like the old fable of the canary in the elephant shit, if you enjoy your situation or make the experience enjoyable, you're fucked.  Predation is rife in both student and staff culture.  Students are far more overt.  Staff just backstab you.  The goal is not to educate.  The goal is strip us  of our humanity so we can do inhuman things.\n\nGet rid of that daily practice, and you're just left with the abyss of depression and sewer-side-all ideation.

The second is an embarrassing wade into \u201cNo SHIT, Sherlock\u201d territory:\n\n***SECTION 1 - The Proven Methods***\n\n- Admitting that I had a problem. This came when I was around 45. I admitted that feeling constantly empty, tearful and hopeless wasn\u2019t sustainable\n- Seeking professional help - which resulted in points below:\n- Medication - took the sharpest part of the edge off the feelings I described above and allowed me to \u201cget my head above water\u201d emotionally\n- Therapy - this has been a core part of recovery. I have learned my core values and how I live to them. That makes me feel 100% me. I have also been able to understand, identify and manage faulty or destructive thoughts processes (this one requires effort and perseverance)\n\n***SECTION 2 - No SHIT, Sherlock***\n\n- I stopped drinking booze. I\u2019d regularly drink until I had a hangover the next day, usually at weekends\n- Admitting to myself that I was trying to \u201cdrink myself happy\u201d\n- Since I\u2019ve stopped drinking, it genuinely feels like I\u2019m playing life on easy mode\n- Shoutout to r/stopdrinking\n\nSo, yeah, that\u2019s me.

So the approach to getting better was different. Instead of \u201cgoing out more\u201d or \u201cdoing more exercise\u201d, what I really needed was some time to recover, with minimal social and sensory input. Getting diagnosed as autistic, meant I learnt a lot about myself and techniques to help.

There's no rush to end what's left of my existence. So I've got all the time in the world.\" In a way, it's something like If I stop caring about life and just start doing stuff, I may eventually find myself somewhere I'm not completely unhappy with. And right now, after being diagnosed with ASD and getting the help I need for 5 years now, I've finally reached a point where i'm somewhat normal and happy. The lack of negativity and the final understanding of why i'm different made me know myself better and hate myself a lot less . The help and support I have gotten in those 5 years from social workers and people I've met because of moving to a new city have helped me develop and grow as a person.

I wouldn't even be the kind of person I am and make the kind of decisions that I make if they weren't who they are, so of course they weren't the kind of parents I (think I) would be.

Because we live in the woods, I can get outside into nature whenever I like. But the combo of getting outside in nature and also leaving my house for an errand, helped me immensely this past year while I was fixing my mental health. \n\nI also really have reduced my phone screen time. I haven\u2019t had most social media in years like insta, etc, but I still like YouTube shorts and a little bit of Reddit time. I completely deleted Reddit after the election, and didn\u2019t get it back until maybe 3 weeks ago. But I really limit my time on here and mostly re downloaded it because I started a couple new video games. \n\nI also am allowing myself to enjoy my hobbies and not be hard on myself if it\u2019s something I do for fun and it\u2019s not me being lazy. Thinking my hobbies made me unproductive and lazy was not healthy. It\u2019s really me refilling my cup so I\u2019m able to do the work and chores I have to. That realization was a huge one for me. \n\nSo now I read a book a week (give or take) play video games, write, paint, crochet, take naps if I\u2019m cranky, bake, listen to music. Lots of fun things. Oh and I found a couple Spotify playlists for anxiety and stress and also an app called insight timer for sleep meditations. \n\nFirst winter I did not succumb to seasonal depression since I moved to the northeast 13 years ago!",

Half an hour each day, I was a different person almost immediately, but I started noticing changes in about 2 weeks.\n\nAfter this, I forced myself to do a 5 minute sketch every day, which usually end up to be 20-30 minutes a day. And, with forcing myself to just open the sketch, I need music. Positivity music, calm, ambiental, productivity, nature sounds. Bam, instant relax.\n\nAfter a while, after I managed to feel like myself, I started doing some home workout. Started with 5 minutes of intense cardio just as I woke up (before waking the kids for school, going to work, and just daily stuff). The day felt so much different after just 5 minutes. I increased the time after a few months (10 minutes). After around 6 months I reached 20 minutes a day. The sensations are magical.",

My morning has much more structure now and I get up and get in a good headspace very quickly now.

Someone online said it massively improved their mental health even if superficially at first but to just keep trying it over time. I was going through some shitttt around that time (5-9ish yrs back) and nobody else knew id do it, it was MY thing and I took back control over my body with that one big stretch every morning. It helped me get through some major funks because I\u2019d be like damn, at least I got my lucky stretch today in tho lol I honestly should restart that again soon it was legit ty internet<3\n\nSecond and third were both from therapists within the last 3yrs. \u201cHurt people hurt people\u201d helped me understand SO much better about why I went through what I did, and \u201ctitration\u201d. \n\nI get frustrated sometimes and think DAMN IT STELLA YEAH TITRATION FUCK TITRATION THO I WANT THIS ISSUE OVER ALREADY but often it\u2019s not that easy lmao. Stella was a GOAT sort of therapist I think technically she was a social worker but she helped facilitate my therapy and actually fully \u201cheard\u201d me when I spoke up to her about things. Titration means small steps and they\u2019re soooo hard to take sometimes. Though taking small steps leads to eventually greater bounds, we can\u2019t just leap to completion we need to focus on each small step and honor it for being the challenging small steps that it is!! Just ignoring the steps all together leads to us getting nowhere, though if we keep honoring and taking those small steps we will end up achieving many more of our goals than expected. Small steps are important to take so we don\u2019t trip and so we know the end destination desired, we don\u2019t always reach the destination quickly but again that\u2019s life/titrate!!

I scheduled a trail ride, had a lot of nerves about it, First ride I held the saddle most of it I let go I felt like I was flying, all my fears gone too. I think made me rethink fear, anxiety of things, trying new things, and trusting friends. Some really cool experiences too that made me happy see reaction of kids watching horse I'm riding, etc. I feel if someone where I was saw me ride and decided to try it, that would be a cool feeling to me.",

Last time we really spoke, I kissed him on the cheek and thanked him for letting me tag along on a trip to our shared friends. Now, he doesn't even respond to a once a month \"how's it going?\" text. \n\nYou know, it's weird. I know we'll have to see each other occasionally, but it's like he killed my respect for him. Zooming out, he seems really depressed. He quit his job last year, living in friend's basement, kinda seems like he's always on grass - he used to be focused on helping people through his work [is a lawyer], now it seems like he gives off angry vibes. Not sure what he's angry about, a once a month silly text is kind of not very intrusive and nothing different from normal. But here we are 4 months later, and this  is my last text. I hope he has a better life soon, but I'm going to go have the friendships I deserve.",

Deleting Facebook, Twitter and Instagram (and putting timers on Tiktok, Bluesky and Reddit) has helped improve my mental health a lot, as well as drastically limiting my phone usage. \n\nOne thing I had to do was slowly replace unhealthy habits with others. For example, instead of scrolling on the train, I sketch or read a book. Taking phone/music-free walks (or as the kids call it, \"rawdogging life\"). I broke my habit of being on my phone while watching TV, which was really hard and took roughly a month of \"this is torture\". Now if a show or movie is too shit to hold my full attention, I either turn it off and do something else, or I'll fold laundry or find something non distracting to do with my hands (like hold a coffee cup). It's also made me realise how amazing older media is.\n\nI've also started doing phone free nights and weekends from time to time. Whenever I'm not going to have my phone on me for longer than a day, I'll usually let my friends and family know beforehand and tell them how to contact me in an emergency. They respect it. On those days I'll usually do phone free activities like play board games, cook with my husband while listening to nice music, make art, do some gardening or go on a nature walk.",

I couldn't make meditation work to break my anxious spiraling or face my suicidal ideation in a way which was constructive. I was also working very long hours with a toxic team which was full of people who were miserable and looking to pin the things going wrong with our project on anyone but themselves. \n\nThe trip I took was with good, trusted friends and gave me a different perspective on my own thoughts - because it madey thought process so weird but so lucid at the same time, I could see that I was experiencing my thoughts rather than **being** those thoughts. Suddenly, everything my therapist was saying was making sense. \n\nAlso, being in a vulnerable position like that with friends but feeling open allowed me to feel that I could share what I was going through and the love I got back from them in return (they were also high and it brought out an openness from them too) did a huge amount for my self worth. \n\nFinally, I realised that all of the dark thoughts I was having were because of my work, lack of sleep and toxic environment. This helped me reframe work in my mind and learn to care less, whilst I looked for a job elsewhere. \n\nReally, the real lasting changes to my mental health were from changing my work environment but I do believe that that trip was the catalyst which helped me get through everything in the short term, even if only because it enabled me to have open conversations with my friends in a way I wouldn't even after a drink or whatever. \n\nDuring the same trip, one of my friends cried because of how thoughtful the fire extinguisher in our apartment was, standing guard for your hour of need...

Also working remotely has been a game changer! \n\n\n\nBeing obedient to God\u2019s direction. I might not listen immediately, but when I start hearing from Him about a certain thing that needs to change, I do start working on that thing. \n\n\n\nTherapy. I\u2019ve had counselors, psychiatrists, psychologists, and now even have a dietician who is helping me to develop a better relationship with food.

Some examples are Mindpump and Dr. Tracey Marks psychiatrist on YouTube. \n\n\n\nReading and listening to audiobooks. I usually peruse Reddit for recommendations for all kinds of topics from leadership to confidence to financial education. \n\n\n\nFollowing only certain pages on social media. Literally if I see toxic content posts, I unfollow immediately - even family! \n\n\n\nPlanning better - writing goals annually, monthly, weekly and doing weekly and monthly and annual reflections. Managing my time better has been so helpful for calmness and peace. \n\n\n\nWaking up early and following a structured schedule.

This meant I ditched/distanced myself from a lot of family members - especially one who was a manipulative narcissist that I now have no contact with, left the 'school mum' crowd, and some close friends. This had the biggest impact on my mental health and stress.\n\nBasically then stepping back and re-evaluating everything in your life. What brings you joy? What brings you pain and stress? What is a need? What is a want? What's really important to me? What is unnecessary? What are you doing that is just a societal pressure/obligation? Be brutal. Cut out as much as possible. For me this meant less involvement in school activities, less cooking, no alcohol, bought things that made my life easier, accepting I needed help with some things, hung out less with people that made me feel like I needed to look different/dress different/buy things, didn't use social media as much, decluttered my house, worked on making my living space peaceful and getting good sleep.\n\nSo I just broke everything down, and over the years I've been building it back up but with intention that my health is my priority. I say no to lots of things. I am very wary of making new friends (there are so many toxic people out there!) I don't care what other people think about me. I practice gratitude often.",

I wasn't even aware of how burnt out I was because it was my \"normal.\" I just thought this was my lot in life and that this was just how things were.\n\n\nThen I meet this guy who is just straight up asking me my opinion about things. And doing things for me. And telling me to relax, that he can handle things himself and I don't HAVE to do X, Y, and Z. And encouraging me to do things for myself because he \"has everything under control, you don't have to do anything. I'm an adult. I can handle my own shit.\"\n\n\nAnd holy shit, he actually says *thank you.*\n\n\nIt made me gradually realize that a massive chunk of my anxiety and depression was because so many people--family and friends--viewed me less as a person than a means to an end, and I'd been running myself ragged fighting everyone's battles but my own. And paying their way, in some cases.\n\n\nAnymore, I have mostly new friends (barring a handful who were always genuinely good; I've put a lot more focus on them), and I've went LC with a lot of my family (my dad's family is fine, but I tend to avoid most of my mom's family now that she's gone).

Feeling included is awesome and I also challenged myself to join events. I am a introvert person with a bit of social anxiety but it was so worth it. Working there is like going to hotel each day but you get paid. Free gym, lunch is like 100$ a month(5$ additionally for each day you want dinner), other free stuff, a lot of social events like football, padel, swimming, hiking++. It\u2019s also possible to take certifications too to learn more. Wish that was how school worked where you get same benefits and are able to develop yourself even further.",

I realized that if I kept doing what I was doing with my partner, living and trying to be happier, I would die happy. It woke me up to what was really important.

I feel like I woke up a different person the morning after I took them. I used to constantly stress about needing to write more and make time for my creative hobbies, and it was more anxiety and shame inducing than it was fun. Now I have new hobbies like hiking, camping, doing arts and crafts, and I spend less time engaging in escapism than I used to. I don't hate my job anymore, I feel more feminine in a good way, I feel more open to expressing my real self, dressing more expressively and doing things I am normally uncomfortable with.

I left home to go into a psychiatric hospital because I had anorexia and my weight was too low and I couldn't turn it round at home. I was told had I refused to be admitted I would have been sectioned and admitted by force, so I agreed to go in. It took roughly a week before I realised how bad things were at home and how unstable and unsafe it was. It took another 5 months to be well enough to leave and I moved into supported housing. Best choice I ever made, right there! The psychotherapy came a few years later and was by far one of the biggest helps I'd had on understanding what my gut was telling me but to which I didn't have the words. I found the words after that. Still not fine but no longer at my family home! I feel so sad for the people today of even my age (43) who cannot leave home because they can't afford to and no matter how hard they work or how many hours of overtime they put in they cannot get together enough to move away. Lift isn't fair, it should be, it isn't.",
