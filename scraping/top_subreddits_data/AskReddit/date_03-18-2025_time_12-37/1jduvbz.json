I knew it was happening, but they always reassured me that we were going to be fine. And I knew we would be because I knew they would do whatever they needed to in order to keep us afloat.\n\nNow that I'm a parent, I think about how I can do that for my kids. To keep a balance of making sure they know we can't just throw money out the window, but also keeping them confident that I'll do whatever it takes to keep us afloat.\n\nSometimes we learn lessons from our parents that we didn't realize were lessons at the time.",

Like 40 hours, till 3am on weekends, midnight on a lot of school nights. I didn\u2019t fail school, I didn\u2019t do good though either, and I wasn\u2019t working to help with home bills either, I just liked it even though I was getting taken advantage of. \n\nBut looking back we it like if your 16 year old is constantly coming home super late almost every day like ???? I thought \u201cwell there was\u2026. a lot of other shit going on too\u2026.\u201d\n\nI did ask my dad like a year or two ago about what he thought about that back then and if he was worried I was doing OTHER stuff or whatever and he was just like *shrug* \u201cyou were working, it\u2019s good for you\u201d lol\n\nReading this thread like damn\u2026. cause I think my dad got it pretty bad between 2007-2012 but he just kept fuckin going somehow lol\u2026. it almost seems like he can just turn his brain off sometimes",

Mostly because it feels like a recession in today's day and age would be way worse than in 2008. Corporate (CEO) greed is worse than ever. The housing market has been trash so most people don't have a house to raise their kids in. It seems that our parents in 2008 had more of the \"American life\" because of how much more affordable things are.\n\nHope you don't have to go through any of that with your children!",

It really hurt her financially and changed a lot of the way we lived and how she behaved around that time. Ended up losing our house several years later because of the damage it did to her during this time frame. There are probably many other kids during that time who weren't shielded from their parents struggle. And I think thats hard and might dictate how we behave this time around.",

There was a lot of quality entertainment (like Guitar Hero 2) that caught me at such an impressionable time.\n\nUnfortunately being a teenager in general was still pretty harsh. Still navigating through divorced parents despite them splitting up years ago, my crush was more-or-less crushing my heart, college-prep and the endless fear/misery that came with it was enough to make me go through some very dark moments.",

Democrats are just as pro-corporation as Republicans, they just have enough foresight to understand that poor people are not going to just *go away*.. they don't really promote social programs to improve our lives, they promote them as a dam to satiate those who would otherwise become a scourge on society. Without social safety nets crime, disease, and homelessness would skyrocket and they wouldn't be able to control it; social nets (in the US)  just enough to keep that scale from tipping. Furthermore, those programs are typically an extension of subsidies to the corporations that they time and time again, vote in favor of over the working class. They award massive government contracts to their buddies who got them elected and turn a blind eye to the worker abuse, tax fraud, and monopolies that those corporations commit. \n\nI don't like playing the \"well both sides!\" card, because in my opinion, the Dems are still MILES better than Republicans, but they are still a very flawed party.

How the 1% went from being the source of 20% of consumer spending to about 50%. Really opened my eyes that our nation is currently designed to serve exclusively the top 10% on the backs of the 90%. The conservative response to this is someone making a billion dollars doesn't effect you because of you divide their wealth among the nation everyone would get very little from them.

Suddenly the towns biggest employer was gone and people who were offered jobs in other plants were taking them\u2026.\n\nExcept the bottom fell out of the housing market too, so nobody could sell their house without taking huge losses. Most of these people had families. I knew people who took jobs 8 hours away, worked for the week and then came home to see their kids on the weekends sometimes. Lots of divorces unsurprisingly. My hometown paper ran a front page article when the last of these people were able to retire or come home a couple years ago.\n\nThe other thing regarding housing is, the values fell, but interest rates rose\u2026.by a lot and variable rates used to be way more common. So suddenly your house is worth NOTHING and your payment is more than it\u2019s ever been, AND you may or may not have lost your job.\n\nIf you had stable employment and could weather it you did, but if you couldn\u2019t the best financial strategy was to stop paying your mortgage.\n\nI forget the statistics but there were a staggering number of foreclosures, but here\u2019s the kicker, it didn\u2019t matter.\n\nI had friends in high school who\u2019s families lived in their foreclosed on houses for years, there was just absolutely no political will or ability to kick that many people out of their homes, and if they did I\u2019m sure people would have been shot.\n\nThere are other stories about when people eventually left they took everything of value out of the home, cabinets, copper pipes, everything. Which is illegal but again, who was going to stop them?\n\nI entered the work force in that world and it was a nightmare. I joined the army and went to college and by the time i was done the tides had turned. But yeah it was fucked.\n\nAnother thing is how expensive gas was, imagine being in high school in 2008 and gas is banging on $5/gallon in a mid sized Midwest town. I remember legitimately paying for a gallon of gas in change because that\u2019s what i had.",

I think one or two schools got in trouble and everyone else quickly changed their policies to avoid trouble.\n\n\nBasically their was one of those chain schools that lied about how many people were graduating with certain degrees and then getting a job based off of it.\n\n\nSo imagine you are looking at schools to get your dream job, let's say graphic designer with a desire to make it into the video game industry. You show up to a schools open house and they sell you on the fact that 80 percent (im making numbers up for illustrative purposes) of those who graduate in that particular field move directly into that industry, so you sign up and pay your fees, you do what you need to do, you graduate, and then apply several places to work and nobody is calling you back. Then you do research and find out that only about 5-10 percent of people that graduated from your program ever got a job in the field.\n\n\nThis was happening around that same time but it kindof got overshadowed by the housing crises and a lot of schools made quick quiet policy changes before people really started to notice.

I was selling into the Oil and Gas industry, so in hindsight I was very fortunate it did not turn out worse.  I do remember going to Houston on business during that time and practically all of my Uber Drivers were Petroleum Engineers who were out of work.",

We're political assassinations and a gas shortage away from the 1960s. \n\nThe world will keep spinning and the sun will keep rising but humanity or at least the majority of it can be gone in no time. Nanoseconds wise.",

Their 9 year old translated the loan documents for them. They paid 200k over what the house was worth (because everyone was doing that) and had a balloon payment they probably didn't understand and definitely couldn't afford.  It makes me sick knowing that happened to them.  I hope they landed softly.  The house is now (in 2025) worth a bit over what they paid for it in 2008.\n\nThe market AFTER the 2008 housing crisis was full of flippers paying cash.  We didn't have a chance.  I watched listings like a hawk.  With a bit of luck, and a lot of offers, we got a fixer upper that had potential and was livable.\n\nWe live in a very high income area. People thought we were nuts for buying where we did, but we could afford it and 10 years later we finished re-modeling.  We have an acre. I had chickens before everyone thought about egg prices. Ended up in an awesome school district. Now no one can buy.  We are never moving.  Everyone else we knew bought McMansions. If one of us loses our jobs we can still pay our mortgage.  House poor people cannot. \n\nWait for the next bubble. Make good choices. Don't try to keep up with what everyone else says is the status quo.  Think outside the box, learn how to fix your own hot water heater, and be ok with bad tile for a few years.  My 2 cents.",

A reporter with a cellular phone (not common at that time) was in a helicopter over downtown Santa Cruz, and the tales of destruction were very alarming to me. It seemed like there was a good chance that people I knew from Santa Cruz might be dead. As it turned out not very many people died in Santa Cruz, and nobody I knew personally. But the downtown was very badly damaged. They built tents for a bunch of the businesses whose buildings had been destroyed. It was a real disaster for downtown Santa Cruz.",

My reasoning being:\n\n- it resulted in a fairly mild recession (in the scheme of recessions) \n- the recession was more contained than other recessions (for example, the UK, Canada, and Australia, amongst others, did not go into recession)\n- it disproportionately impacted equities traders and investors who were long the Nasdaq, which is an important subset of people, but not as widespread or systemic as, say, the housing market.\n- by the time it was really impacting the average person, 11 September 2001 happened and changed everything anyway.\n- the lasting effects (in the scheme of world history) were pretty limited. The internet age dawned nonetheless, markets recovered, the unemployment spike was smaller and shorter than many other recent recessions, and the political repercussions (certainly in the US at least) were fairly tame (again, the WTC attacks and subsequent foreign adventures played a role in that).\n\nIt was an undoubtedly important world event (particularly in the US) and the bubble will certainly be studied for decades to come in economics classes. But I personally wouldn't classify it as a \"world changing event\", certainly not on the scale of 11 September, or COVID, or the GFC. However, I'm happy to be proven wrong!",

What privacy?\n   * The First Reality TV Explosion From MTV's The Real World, then Cops, Survivor and American Idol. People eating bugs, and back stabbing for fame.\n * Global Shake-Ups (with a Side of WTF):\n   * End of the Cold War (Late 80s/Early 90s): ...followed by a period of weird uncertainty. What was the new world order, anyway?\n   * Gulf War (1990-1991): Live war coverage, 24/7. The gamification of conflict?\n   * 9/11 (2001): The day the world changed... and conspiracy theories exploded.\n   * The Iraq War (2003): Remember WMDs?\n * Economic Rollercoaster (to the Abyss and Back):\n   * Black Monday (1987): The market tanked. Early taste of economic dread.\n   * Dot-Com Bubble & Bust (Late 90s/Early 2000s): Pets.com. Enough said.\n   * Housing Crisis/Great Recession (2008): People losing everything. Foreclosure signs everywhere. The American Dream... shattered?\n   * Student Load Debt Reaching record levels in the 2010's. Crippling debt for a generation.\n * Social & Cultural Shifts (Into the Strange):\n   * AIDS Epidemic: A terrifying and heartbreaking era, fueled by misinformation and fear.\n   * Internet & Social Media: From innocent chatrooms to... the dark web. We've seen it all. Online echo chambers? Conspiracy theories thriving? Check.\n   * Same-Sex Marriage Legalized: Progress... but also backlash. The culture wars rage on.\n   * Obama Elected (2008): Hope... and then the rise of intense political polarization.\n   * #MeToo & Black Lives Matter: Necessary movements... met with resistance and online harassment.\n * The \"This Can't Be Real\" Era:\n   * COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-Present): Lockdowns, mask mandates, vaccine debates... and a whole lot of misinformation spreading faster than the virus.\n   * The Rise of \"Fake News\": Disinformation everywhere. What's real anymore?\n   * Climate change Becomes an accepted term. Extreme weather, denials, while we approach tipping points.\n   * Mass Shootings. Columbine, Sandy Hook, Parkland.\n   * The 2016 & 2020 US Elections.\n\nBottom Line: \n\nYou haven't just lived through history; you've lived through a period of rapid, often unsettling, change. From technological leaps to social upheavals to global pandemics, it's been a wild ride. You've seen the best and worst of humanity, often in quick succession. The world is a weirder, more unpredictable place than it was in 1977, and you've had a front-row seat to the whole show.",

Am I that \"we\" and if so, who am I being sold to? The founders thought and fought for language which I now participate, so who is this \"we\"?\n\nLet me tell you something about this \"we, the people\" subscribed here in America. It is a newly-upgraded populace, now with global intelligence. Many feel AI is regional, with the old ideas about borders and protection. We all feel AI means Augmented Intelligence, and no one can restrict your intelligence.\n\nThere will always be a melting problem here in this pot. Do we have too much freedom? Part of that problem was that some people lived a different life, they simply decided how to live and that decision was different. How do I make them pay a little bit towards how I live and think?\n\nAugmented Intelligence helps here, you can ask it to replay your own life as someone else. Is Empathy a detriment or a virtue? Should humans born elsewhere have any rights at all? Empathy is knowing your part in history, and realizing you might be seen as a villain in the future. It takes a village to raise some adults.\n\nDivision makes us weak.\n\nThink about those you lost, and multiply their hopes and dreams. That is the promise of AI, augmenting our intelligence not by their slop but by their unique human contribution. We all add something.\n\nMy grandparents were raised divided and racist, because they were born white. Their perspective on the last world war, the American civil rights movement, the continuing immigration here due to our sand and current politics was slanted. Everyone crossing into democracy, through birth or border is new. How do we treat our new citizens?\n\nWho makes an American? If you have a child, who teaches them to be racist? Did you vote against the suffrage of women, should they be property? Do rich people deserve different, and more elevated rights than those struggling? We ask who we are.\n\nWe are we. Always have been, divided by special interests and their ambition, but rejoiced in the tiny gestures of unity. We never needed help dividing, but division creates an electorate.\n\nWe are the future, and the side-effects of that drug do not slow our progress. A king forcing cruelty does not make us strong. A king measures his foot, while stepping into his grave. We, as Americans, are people of strength. Eventually we will notice the weakness of division and rejoin the strength in unity.",

They buy a controlling stake in the company and take it private using a mix of their own cash and debt. They then transfer the debt they used to buy the company to the company itself (so the debt is now owned by the company and not the PE group). Next, they sell off the valuable assets (like the real estate), but instead of paying off the debt, they pay themselves in bonuses. Finally, once the valuable assets have been liquidated, they let the company go bankrupt and they walk away richer than before with no debt obligations.\u00a0\n\nA restaurant chain, like Red Lobster, that has so-so performance and owns the land all the restaurants are built on, is a prime example.\u00a0\n\nEdit: I recall one scenario they actually sold the real estate to another company the PE group owned and then started leasing the land back to the company they intended to bankrupt.

The problem is that as interest rates continue to rise, the cost of servicing that debt balloons and causes the acquired companies (like Joann's, Hooters, and more) to collapse despite being profitable on a store by store basis and being financially stable prior to acquisition.\n\n[This video](https://www.tiktok.com/@tiffanycianci/video/7482802045230075182?lang=en) alleges that this variable interest private equity debt is being packaged and sold on the secondary market to various targets including pensions and is at risk of collapsing both pensions and significant portions of the US economy in basically any sector that private equity is involved in. Medical, retail, hospitality, sports, you name it.",

They originally gave me 1 intern and about $10k for cloud costs when I was developing it and they said there was no way we could compete in that space so my team had to focus on our other projects, while I worked extra hours to make it happen. My taking that risk is the reason anyone in the company had bonuses at Christmas.

To meet this, I started teaching night classes for all the employees, including all those old guys who did maintenance in the District. Until the day I leave this plane of existence, I will never forget how absolutely petrified some of these men were. One guy, a true jack-of-all-trades expert in fixing motors, blowers, fuses, electrical stuff, etc. had never once used a computer. He was in my class, under duress, and it showed. His hands trembled when using the mouse. His hunt-and-pecking was laborious and stuttery. After the first evening, I pulled him aside and told him, *\"I understand why you're nervous. Your job is at risk, but I promise if you show up every night and make an attempt at the lessons, I will not fail you. Lean on me. I'll help you.\"*\n\nSo, of course I passed him and he kept his job. And I never once in the next few years at that school, had a burnt-out light, squeaky door, or problem with the HVAC.",

I graduated from college in 2010 and got accepted into a PhD program, but they offered no financial aid because they got hit hard by the recession, too. I declined it and went into the workforce, but could only find part-time minimum wage jobs in retail and food service, so I worked 2-3 jobs for 1 year until landing my first full-time job which barely paid much more: $22k a year with no benefits. And I was misclassified as an independent consultant, so I owed taxes. I landed my first job with a livable wage at the time ($35k) and benefits one year after that. Then got another job a year after that, where I still work today\u2014that was 3 years after graduating.\u00a0\n\nMy parents were subprime mortgage victims, so they lost their house. They rented for years until buying again in 2017 iirc. They still have $200k left to pay off, so I worry about where the current economy is at. My parents are just a few years from retiring. Right before the Great Recession, my dad just left the Navy after 20 years and got his bachelors and masters in nursing. He graduated right before the recession hit; he was 46. You\u2019d think the demand for nurses is always high, but he struggled to find work. For a couple years, he worked a job at the airport cleaning out the airplanes after they land. Then he finally landed a job at a nursing home, which doesn\u2019t pay much. I think he did that for a year until getting an admin job at the VA, then a year later he finally got a nursing job at the VA. Now with all the VA cuts, he\u2019s worried he\u2019ll get laid off. He\u2019s 63.",

Teachers who were at retirement age and had plans to leave in a year or two clung to dear life to their jobs- and with seniority, they had way more security than if they left for other pastures.\n\nMy own father got paranoid about leaving his desk. The office was rapidly emptying as every day he saw parades of poor bastards take the trip to HR and return looking like human BSODs.

He told me it was in solidarity for me quitting. Gas was $4.5 per gallon and we all knew something was about to break, we just didn\u2019t know what. Then large companies began to falter.

We put the house up for sale, but because prices were dropping we were underwater on our mortgage and couldn\u2019t sell it. Even after a year and multiple price drops, we never got a single offer. No one was buying.\n\nWe took money out on line of credit to cover the mortgage payments (ya, you aren\u2019t supposed to do that. I know.)\n\nMy husband got a job at a tech startup that only paid him sporadically, some times not for months and then let him go when he said he needed to be paid. After that at fish plant and came home in pain every night because he\u2019s tall and the tables were short.\n\nI ended up finding and working 3 shitty jobs. 16 hours a day, 7 days a week and often just slept in my car between shifts during my 2 hour break, and on my 6 hour break I\u2019d go home.\n\nWe didn\u2019t have heat that first winter, thankfully before we moved somewhere where that would be deadly, but we would still have a thin layer of ice form on top of a water glass if we left it near the exterior wall on the counter. The cold was the most miserable part for me. I\u2019d sleep in layers, with a toque, inside a sleeping bag, with a blanket. Getting out of bed in the morning was rough.\n\nI couldn\u2019t eat rice for a couple years after because we pretty much survived off that and whatever we could grow or forage. I\u2019m talking down to the dandelions in our yard. To this day I distinctly remember wanting milk one day, and just laying in bed crying because it cost $3.86 and I couldn\u2019t afford it. \n\nI essentially didn\u2019t see my husband for 9 months because our shifts were opposite. Once in a while we\u2019d cross paths as one of us was coming home and the other was leaving.\n\nThe last 3 months of that 9 months I was chronically sick probably because always working never sleeping.\n\nWe were ready to walk away and let the house go into foreclosure. But then we both found better jobs again and got a handle on things. We crawled out of the debt we had dug ourselves in. Never lost the house. \n\nIt sucked. Honestly it sucked for a few years having to dig ourselves out and get back on track, but none as bad as the first year. But we got through it and are in a much better place now. \n\nOf the people I know personally, I think we were hit some of the hardest with the timing (just bought a house, no equity) and both being out of work. I know a lot of people that their investments maybe didn\u2019t fair well for a while, but otherwise they kept their jobs and life went on as normal and they made no changes to their daily lives.",

We had many friends that got screwed and had to short sale or foreclose on their starter homes. \n\nHad a kid in 2009 and spent the next 9-10 years trying to get ahead at all. Finally things for better. Husband started making good money. We bought a house for dirt cheap in 2010 and it was worth almost double what we bought. We moved in 2019 to a much nicer area and a larger home. Refinanced at the right time and have a mortgage at 3%. Finger crossed husband doesn't loose his job in whatever shit is coming. We'll be ok for a few months if he does, but man I really don't want to go through 2008 again. \n\nI got really good at couponing and finding free things to do in the area. We walked and rode our bikes alot to save on gas. Lots of crock pot meals and peanut butter sandwiches. We put off a lot of home repairs and did a lot of things ourselves. Shoveled snow instead of buying a snow blower, used cloth diapers, got books from the Imagination Library, etc. Lots of doing without. It really reminded me of my childhood in the 1980s. I'm sure my parents were struggeling to get back to normal after the shit show that was the 1970s and Reaganomics. \n\nWe spent a lot of time together and with friends. Everyone was broke so a Friday night out was watching a dvd or playing a card game. Our street had a block party every summer because it was cheap. It wasn't all horrible, but it has hard and discouraging especially when you're starting out your adult life. \n\nMake smart decisions. Don't take out giant car loans. Get the credit cards paid off and save at least a month's worth of bills in an emergency fund. Get used to going without and using what you already have.",

Don't focus on legal, illegal. It's simply a fact that many people are no longer buying groceries, buying gas, etc.  so fewer cashier's are needed. Fewer waiters. Money in the system is multiplicative.  Couple that with tens of thousands good paying fed jobs disappearing. So that's money out of the economy. Tariffs are making things more expensive.  Like it or not, our president is not popular in other countries and people in those countries are buying less American products. That is a lot of shocks to the economic system all at once. It can take awhile to see the effects but they are coming",

Investors were investing in crappy tech companies early, pumping up the numbers, and merging a few companies together in a bundle to make them look less risky. The original lenders made profits off of later rounds of investors who took on most of the risk in a shady way. It fell apart and the investors were protected. \n\nThe second bust was giving loans to unqualified people, then packaging a bunch of loans together  as collateralized bundles to make it seem like they were less risky and selling them to investors. The original lenders got the closing fees and initial profits, then passed off the risk in a shady way. It fell apart and the investors were protected. \n\nToday, private equity is doing some bullshit where they take out loans to buy companies, sell off all of that company's assets, transfering the loans to the company they just bought, then packaging a bunch of these loans together as collateralized bundles to seem less risky. These private equity companies are making a lot of money from initial sell off of assets, then passing the risk off in a shady way.\n\nNotice a pattern?",

If anything there\u2019s been a delay from credit and generous tech severance packages but the leeway from those seem to be nearing an end. Credit balances are ever increasing at higher than ever interest rates and severance packages only last so long before the money runs out or the recipient decides to start buckling up.",

I guess if things go way south again, I\u2019ll have to get a PhD\u2026",

                    "body": "Graduating in '09 *sucked.* \n\nI had a few classes to make up over the summer, so I stuck around my college town, miraculously finding a job at a Jiffy Lube. That job carried me through my classes, but ended abruptly when the boss's boss stopped by and fired me for sitting on the ground trying to recover from heat exhaustion. A friend managed to get me an unpaid internship (graphic design), but it was quickly apparent that it was going nowhere. I had one contact that liked my final project enough to say \"give me a call.\" When I did, he was out looking for a job as well, and this was a guy who looked like he'd made it: position at a small but swanky design firm, vintage Porsche, etc. I couldn't believe it.\n\nI coasted until Christmas. Any place with an open position asked why I wanted to work there if I had a college degree. I should have lied and said I was still working on it, but hindsight and all that. Any place that would have wanted my degree wasn't hiring. Grad school wasn't an option; I was out of money, and certainly not going to take on more loans. My parents were at least understanding enough to let me move back home. They came up to help me move, even though nearly everything I owned fit in my Mazda sedan. I paid my last share of the bills by giving my roommate my Dremel. \n\nDepression hit me pretty quickly upon coming home. At least being broke and jobless in my college town afforded me friends. I didn't even have that anymore. I spent most of my time torrenting movies and playing the early days of Minecraft. Or sleeping. Getting up before noon was almost physically impossible. I would eventually add Starcraft II to that list -- which would ultimately be the catalyst for pulling me out of this situation, funnily enough -- but not before standing in front of the boxes on the shelf calculating what percentage of my meager wealth it would take to purchase it.\n\nMy parents, while understanding at first, thought I was being lazy. I would chase whatever leads would come up, but they all went nowhere. When they said it can't be that bad, I would pull up the job listings. There was always a position out in Salt Lake for some reason, but that was it. This usually incited some sort of boomerism in response, \"You just need to hit the pavement and get your foot in the door!\" When I suggested doing something like bartending school, they would get mad and ask why they bothered sending me to college. Like I said, they understood... at first.\n\nIt wouldn't be until Feb 2011 that I would find a job. I had managed to make new friends in the interim, and they seemed happy to drive me downtown and buy me pity drinks, but that didn't help my depression much. It was so relieving when I could finally buy a round or two. The job was for painting houses and only lasted a year. I wouldn't be truly stable until 2014, and wouldn't find a job relative to my degree until 2020, ironically. I still have spending habits and irrationalities that persist from the time period.\n\nThe Recession was hell, and if I sound bitter about it, I am.",

Not in the way you're implying, anyway. \n\nFirst, the government *did* let the big investment banks fail at first. Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns were two of the largest investment banks in the world, and they collapsed overnight with no government rescue. \n\nIt wasn't until they actually collapsed, and the entire financial system started to teeter, that the government actually felt that it was mandatory to step in and avoid the entire system falling down.\n\nAnd when they did step in, they didn't deliver free cash like the public thinks they did. The surviving banks didn't get any long-term benefit - what they got was essentially loans that allowed them to bridge the gap period and survive to eat their own losses. \n\nIn everyday terms, imagine that your bank account gets locked due to fraud, and it won't unlock for 30 days. The problem is that your mortgage is due tomorrow. You have enough money in your account to pay your mortgage, but you just can't access it in time. You're not insolvent, but if you can't figure out some way to bridge the gap and pay your mortgage while your account is frozen, your house will get foreclosed on. So you take out a loan for the monthly mortgage payment, pay your mortgage, and then in 30 days when your account unlocks you pay back the loan plus interest. You did not come out ahead - you just managed to survive with the loan. \n\nThat's basically what happened with the banks. The \"bailouts\" were paid back, plus interest, to the government. No bank got to keep any of it long term.",

Nobody treated that as normal, and large amounts of money were spent fixing the situation, and yet with housing, the more vital resource for survival, supply hasn't kept up with demand for decades, and in fact there's a large political bloc (homeowners) that has a vested interest in keeping supply restricted.\n\nThe other part that appreciates is the land under the house, and the funny thing about that is land isn't valuable because of what's on it, but what's around it.  Land is valuable because of access to nearby public goods, jobs, retail, etc.  That is to say, when land appreciates, none of it is due to the owner of the land and all of it is due to the community activity and public investment via the government.\n\nNone of this is good for the economy as a whole.  Those who were/are fortunate enough to get in on the escalator benefit, and those stuck on the ground floor pay them for the scraps.\n\nOr, they sleep on the streets, so homeowners can get richer.",

In the most professional way possible, I told them that they were all certifiably insane and to go fuck themselves and I refused the sign the increase. I also invited them to fire me if they wanted to. \n\nI went back to my desk and watched as the recession hit my department almost immediately that year, exactly as I had explained to those idiots that it would. Seeing my department take the same exact hit as everyone else made them pull their heads out of their asses, as little as that was possible for them to achieve, so I wasn't fired.\n\nIn the end my commission was pretty much non-existent for a while, but I had a damned good salary and was very good with money budget-wise so it had almost no affect on me day to day. \n\nedit: I should add I lost about 30% of my retirement investments which wasn't as bad a many people I knew, so I considered myself lucky on that front.",

We still took some hits at a macro level, because everyone else was spending less outside their own borders and we are an exporting country.\n\nSo, our housing market dropped a little, but we didn't have as many foreclosures and such as in the US.

            "body": "I had to leave college a semester and a half before graduation to try to find work and conserve the money I saved in high school. I saved 14k working all through HS, so I floated around for a bit when I lost my apartment (complicated story semi related to the recession).\n\nI did odd jobs and applied everywhere as the economy fully collapsed until I was completely out of money. I couch surfed wherever I could sleep, and when I didn't have somewhere to stay, I slept in my car at Walmart or in a nearby church parking lot. I showered at the gym even when I stayed with friends to be courteous.\n\nI applied to hundreds of jobs, but there was no work. Dozens of my favorite places closed, and new faces showed up on the streets every day. Most looked like they hadn't shaved in a few days and held signs saying things like, \"will work for money.\" They got more and more dishevelled and tired looking as the weeks went by.\n\nRight when I decided to join the military since it was either that or die on the streets, I ran into a guy from my hometown and crashed at his place for a couple nights. That ended up turning into a semi-permanent housing arrangement. He was filthy and a drug addict, but living with him got me off the streets, so I cooked and cleaned to pay rent and would sleep in my car whenever I felt like I was overstaying my welcome. \n\nEventually, he moved to a house, and I followed. We ended up living with between 6 and 14 guys depending on the week. I slept on the ground behind a recliner until a bunk opened up, which I took as my first bed since the recession started, and became the house's \"official\" cook. \n\nWhen I got desperate, I ended up emailing a catering company I worked for a bit in college that I thought had folded. Turned out the owner and his cook were keeping it alive. By late 2010, I sent that email and dropped the name of his co-owner and added a picture knowing he was gay and I'm fairly attractive (he later admitted the picture was why he hired me), and he hired me on a job-by-job basis since he was just started to expand again. I ended up being one of maybe seven employees and busted my ass for $11 an hour.\n\nThat turned into a flexible part time job after a year or so. While I worked there, I did every side job I could find. At that point, I was living on credit card debt and opening new cards to transfer the balance and not pay interest, but I basically had to live on $150 ish a week. That meant eating VERY little, so I started struggle meals like broiled onions with hot sauce and mayo, peanut butter, and stir fries. Luckily, my job was catering, so I basically ate because my boss was great and let us bring home wedding leftovers. They knew I was destitute, so no one batted an eye at me leaving with six to go boxes per event.\n\nFrom there, I worked in the kitchen in the mornings and did events at night. I usually worked 12-16-hour days 3-6 days a week. It depended on how many events there were that week, but that was normal. Most weekends, I worked 35-50 hours, with Fridays being 16 hours, Saturdays being 16 hours, and Sundays being 12 hours. If I got lucky, there would be a Monday or Thursday as well. My longest weekend was 50 hours. 20, 20, 10.\n\nI did an event for headhunters across the country. There were 3000 of them. I talked to several of them, but one was fully transparent. When I asked her what I should do if I lost my job, she said, \"don't. You won't get another one.\" That was 2011. By 2012, companies were kind of coming back, and I got a few more job offers. I ended up moving to my hometown and making a lot less, but the stress in the city was killing me. I topped out at $13.20 an hour after 250 events.\n\nLong story short, it was bad. I became very resilient, but man was it bad. I floated for years and lost my entire early adulthood. I went back and finished my bachelor's and got a master's and owned a pool cleaning business until I got injured, but I graduated directly into COVID. I'll never recover from either downturn, and every dream I've ever had has gotten delayed and abandoned so I could survive. I'm only just now leaning into my dreams at 37, but that's only possible because my wife has finally hit her stride (her story is very similar). \n\nI've basically worked 50+ hours at no less than two jobs at a time since then, but between putting my wife and I through school later in life and the increases in CoL, we've never gotten ahead. We recently left our home state to a lower CoL area and are finally working less and making more. I very much hope none of us have to go through that bad of a downturn again. Another downturn will clean out most people for good. We've already deferred every hope and dream. Another recession will destroy us.",

Right as we were supposed to be getting established, we were unemployed or working for scraps. We didn't buy homes. We didn't get married or have kids. You can see the impact today of a missing generation of children and adults who are really behind on retirement, savings, career growth, and net worth compared to the generations ahead of us.

Four years after the mortgage meltdown nobody could still get a mortgage loan and house prices were still down from the 2007-2008 crash. \u00a0So in 2012 I made a lowball offer on a crappy house that had been on the market for two years and could not sell because the banks were not lending. It took me almost 9 months to get a mortgage, but I stuck around and bought the house. Got a great price. turned around and sold it five years later for twice as much. That is a primary reason I am doing well today. So while I did have a tight time making ends meet for a while, ultimately i benefited from the market swings. \u00a0\n\nTo get lucky like this, it\u2019s partly luck, but it\u2019s partly being super careful. To benefit from a recession you have to always live within your means though. Even when there is not a recession, you need to be as thrifty as if the market had already crashed. For literally a decade when things were good, I didn\u2019t \u00a0buy coffee or eat out, not even in a fast food restaurant. I lived in a shitty apartment but the rent was OK and I watched people who were in houses they heavily borrowed on lose a lot of money. If you even have $1000 to your name in an emergency fund, and *avoid credit card and automobile debt like the plague*, you will make it through a recession better than most people.",

            "body": "Having been though a BUNCH of them, no two recessions are the same.  The 07-08 recession was very broad based but at the same time the biggest impact was to people with housing issues.  If you happened to live in an area immune to said housing issues it was possible to not feel the bulk of the impacts.  Same if you worked for the federal government.  One of the key features of government jobs is that while pay raises are slow, you almost never have pay cuts or layoffs (YMMV.  Does not apply to current administration).  Being military and living in Monterey CA at the time we felt almost no impact.  In fact it was a great time to have steady income as things got dirt cheap.  \n\nThe biggest thing that happened during 08 recession was the death of pay raises.  People were so desperate for a job - any job - that employers figured out they could pay abusive wages and make insane demands on people.  Benefits got destroyed.  401K matching went to 4% or less.  Health care benefits got gutted to the required minimum.  It took until the COVID labor shortage to claw back pay BTW.  \n\nWhat is going to make this recession so different is that its so stupid.  Cutting federal workers and slapping tariffs on imports is not the normal way to trigger a recession.  \"Business Leaders\" will say all the right things but they are secretly loving this.  Federal workers are, in general, high skill and you normally have to pay a premium to get them.  Now?  They are snatching them up at bargain prices.  At the same time they can go back to making stupid low offers on new employees because they can.  And god forbid you are even well tanned.  If you look foreign you will get a shit offer and told \"be a real shame if I called ICE and said you were an illegal.\"\n\nOne of the other things that will be different this time is education.  Normally in a recession the smart move is to head back to college to reskill.  You ride out the recession and then when the up cycle happens you have new skills to sell.  The Reagan/Bush recession basically created the dot com boom because tons of people went to grad school right when tech was hitting a critical inflection point.  Not this time.  By gutting education funding the traditional hideout will become a trap.\n\nAgain, this is going to be the stupidest recession ever.",

Sure enough, when we got there, a third of the cars in Dell\u2019s parking lot in Round Rock had Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio plates. I guess a lot of Ohio State and MSU grads had the same idea, lol.

You were constantly waiting for the crisis to hit your particular industry and you knew it was only a matter of time. The recession didn't hit every industry at once. For example, I was a contractor for law firms and immediately after the recession, there was kind of an uptick in work, as people started litigating breaches of contract in housing and infrastructure related work. Eventually, as companies went under and people filed for bankruptcy, the floor fell out from under the law firms, too.\n\n3. The suburbs were depressing as fuck.

He said (imagine a russian accent)\n\nFirst, all savings is destroyed.  \nSecond, factory pay workers with output of factory  \nThird, all police and security forces form criminal syndicate\n\nThe main problem with 2008 was people losing their homes and financial asset price collapse. One thing I will tell you is that the smartest thing you could have done in 2008, if you got caught out on your mortgage, would be to keep all other accounts current and just stop paying the mortgage. Many people tried to save their house by not paying any of their other bills and their credit was destroyed.\n\nThe banks really didn't want to evict people. In many cases, they were happy to let people live in the home for as long as a year or two after they stopped paying just so they could mow the lawn and take care of the place. The reason for this is that in some of the hardest hit areas, 20 or 30 percent of the homes were in default in a neighborhood. If they all move out, the whole neighborhood goes down in value.\n\nAnyway, consider a strategic default. But honestly, if we have economic collapse now, it will probably be different in many respects than 2008. Every crisis is a little bit different and has new challenges. Invest in yourself. Stay on good terms with friends and family. Make sure you have useful skills in the context of society where nothing is working the way it is supposed to. Can you macgyver a fix to most of the stuff in a house? That is good. Are you an expert on corporate tax reduction? That is not so good. Can you grow potatoes, squash, beans? That is good. You get the picture.\n\nDon't be surprised if this rickety old cart manages to roll down the road for quite a few more years before the wheels come off. I really thought 2008 was the beginning of a total financial collapse of society. Some of the decisions I made based on that idea maybe weren't the best. I mean it worked out OK. But the idea here is to HEDGE rather than go all in on collapse. Take a few simple steps to minimize your suffering in the case of collapse. But be ready for society to recover and move on.",

They went to Florida and talked to many people in the housing market chain. At one point they went around with a real estate agent to a street that had a for sale sign on every house. They asked why one couple who was on their lawn was selling and the agent said that both were laid off of work and can't find a job. Point being that things were getting bad and a lot of people didn't notice.\n\nI graduated high school in 2007. I could not find a job but had to keep looking because my father and I had to move to the next town over because the town we both grew up in didn't have any jobs either of us could find. In 2008 the best I could do was get a part time job, so I went to community college as well. From there it was just an attempt for us to keep our heads above water one step at a time.\n\nI kept moving and doing work were I could. It was hard to find any work let alone anything that paid. No vacations, no health insurance, nothing of any kind that my father took for granted out of high school. I felt like a lot of expectations of people were gone for people though because it was a recession. You have two part time jobs and don't have a five year plan or a savings account? You don't give gifts to your extended family for Christmas? Oh well, it is a recession after all. Do what you want and find some happiness today and tomorrow.\n\nThe only difference from this day in 2025 and what I remember in 2007 is the price of things. If an actual recession of any kind happens the prices will have to go down or else it will have a different effect and mentality for everyone that has to go through this again.",

They said there was no way his projections were accurate blah blah blah.\n\nThen it seemed like one day my department had NOTHING to do.  My job was to basically build reports for our sales team to present to potential buyers of properties.  People just STOPPED wanting to buy.  So I as well as most of the entire staff had nothing to do.  So, we just watched the market from October-September.\n\nDuring that time I guess the marketing team had so much time on their hands that they made a video montage to lift our spirits.  In late September they got the entire team together (60-80 people) and we watch that video. The background music was \"Right Now\" by HIAM.  At the end of it, they assured us that we would ALL weather the storm together.\n\nThe week after New Years we all come in, and first thing the big bosses do is gather everyone and give us the news.  They tell us that each of us has received an email that would tell us what time we were to come in the next day.  Then we were sent home.  They shit canned 75% of us.  \n\nWe all new it was coming.  I was 23 when that happened, and it was my first REAL job.  I don't think anyone understood how bad things were going to get, especially myself.  But I got the experience of seeing it all happen almost a year before the housing market took a dump.",

This was all before the divorce was even finalized.  \n  \nMy little sister was gaslit into thinking that everything was my mom's fault. She accused her of abuse (which is complete BS) at the divorce proceedings. It's been over 15 years since and my little sister still refuses to communicate with my mom. My dad got money from a trust that his mother (my grandma) left him. Pooling the money from that and the savings of his new gal, they bought a set of apartments in Portugal and live there as landlords. I do not communicate with my dad and only speak to my little sister on birthdays or holidays. My mom is the only member of my family that I speak with and we call weekly. She's doing much better now.  \n  \ntldr: 2008 financial crisis was the catalyst that ended my family.",

            "body": "I don't know how it was in the rest of the world, but I remember something  truly scary that started to happen in Spain. Just keep in mind these two contexts: recession and early social media advertising.\n\nBasically, the rise of Facebook motivated that brands, companies and people began \"hiring\" other people and content creators for free, paying for their services in visibility. It was the time of \"you give us your work, we feature your name in the article\".\n\nThis sparked in us a mentality of \"I'm lucky to be even considered for this job\", which in turn meant we would have to lower our pretensions and work for next to nothing for years, even after the recession was well behind us.\n\nI got a couple of examples: \n\n\\- Back in 2016, I worked for Spain / LATAM's biggest news sites. At that time, Facebook was veeeeery popular and this site kinda made the squared, 1 min. long piece of news format popular. They hired me for only 1000 \u20ac a month. This is gross salary, btw, and I even had to cover my freelancer's and social security fees, because they didn't even hire me as an employee, but as a collaborator (which basically was working full time, but it was their way around paying taxes for me). I urge you to read the 1st sentence of this paragraph again: I was working in Spain / LATAM's biggest news site (it was the most read/watched during 2016 and part of 2017, I mean), and they didn't even bother to hire me properly.\n\n\\- Two years later, I was working for a prestigious branding agency, one which had won important national prizes. I was working for HOURS, some days going up of 14 working hours. I made around 1200 \u20ac per month then, and I was hired, so a full employee, not a false collaborator as in the other place. One day I decided to split my salary by the real working hours (not the 8 hours that appeared in my contract) and I was baffled to see I was getting paid under 5\u20ac per hour. \n\nFor extra context: I have an university degree and two master's. I had to borrow money from my mother in order to make ends meet through the month. And still, even though I knew I was being paid just scraps, I was kinda happy thinking I was working for an important place that would open other doors for me. Also I loved my jobs, both of them, so that also contributed to the situation. \n\nIn the last years since those experiences I've come to appreciate a job that I don't necessarily love, but that pays for all the bills and gives me peace of mind. I mean, I love working here, but it's not like the passion I had when I was working for the news site or the branding agency. I would not trade one thing for the other.\n\nAlso, being in my late 30s and with a baby on the way, I'm scared to death of a new recession.",

It\u2019s only when I look back I realise the impact was huge.\n\nI graduated into a market with absolutely no graduate jobs, and worked in a bar for two years until things began to improve. I also moved to a bigger city where there were more jobs, still doing bar work but also doing free work experience in a more relevant industry during the days, often working from 10-6 for free then doing my bar shift from 6 until sometimes 3am. All whilst applying for jobs. Even then, I got my foot in the door through someone I met on a night out, who latter posted that his company was hiring junior roles on FB. \n\nWhen I did land my first career role, the salary was incredibly low - I was just happy to be on a steady contract. But the salary was probably about half what the same job would have been before the recession, and it took years for salaries to start going up. I would be hiring juniors for the same role on much higher salaries later on (inflation aside). \n\nThis is why for me, the impact on the recession was subtle. What it really cost me was time - I would say it added at least a five year delay on my post university life. It felt like I started lower on the rung than people who came in years later.

I was tossed out of the house because the family \u201ccouldn\u2019t afford me anymore,\u201d (there was more to it than that, but there were three other much younger kids still in the home that needed to be provided for). My mother had lost her job, my stepdad was busting ass to make ends meet, and the little I was able to work for wasn\u2019t helping at all. My dad also had lost his job and was living in unstable situations, so I was on the street. \n\nI had grown up in unstable situations, so it wasn\u2019t too new, it was just the first time I was entirely on my own to figure shit out. I kept going to school and got food and showers there, and couch surfed with friends as much as possible during cold months. We lived in a more rural area that was slowly becoming a commuter area to a small city, so there were no services to help me, other than the county health department, which did provide basic medical care and some needed medication. By the time I graduated high school in 2010, I was 95 pounds, constantly sick, my hair had thinned from falling out, teeth had started to crack. I ended up in the hospital with flu and pneumonia shortly after graduation. I\u2019m lucky I didn\u2019t die. \n\nAs soon as I was able, i made my way to that small city and I got a full time, not under the table job. I also did under the table work. I managed to find a small sketchy apartment that was willing to rent to me alone, and made shit work. No furniture, I slept on the floor in a pallet of blankets. Older folks I worked with at the time gave me blankets, towels, cookware and dishes from their own homes to help me get started. One of my bosses would bring me extra food. A friend I made bought me a line on her cell phone family plan.\nFrom 18-20 I hopped from job to job finding better work/pay, and enrolled myself in school part time. Those early years are very blurry, mostly because they were so\u2026.simple and same every day. Work, sleep, eat if I had food. \n\nIt was hell. Not a burning, brimstone hell. A bland, blank, desolate room in the back of some run down government building kind of hell. Some people say I bootstrapped it and made it through but that\u2019s a lie.\n\nI am only here because of the kindness of countless others, all people who were struggling through the recession themselves, but who made room for some scrawny gutter kid. Friends parents who packed extra lunches for me, or sent clean clothes to school with their kids. The guidance counselor who advised how to make it through and refused to let me drop out. Maintenance staff who unlocked a back door for me to slip in to school early to have warm showers and get some sleep before class. Coworkers, friends, the staff at that county health center. People who had zero obligation to help, did it anyway. \n\nI\u2019m doing considerably better these days. I do my best to pay all those people back by helping other people in rough situations. I\u2019m very afraid for the next few years, and how thin I\u2019ll end up stretched, or if I\u2019ll end up back where I started. But until then, I\u2019m gonna make damn sure to help where I can. If you can, you should too. That\u2019s how we make it through this sort of thing. \n\nSometimes I still sleep on the floor. Its a good reminder.",

            "body": "There are tons of people out there who don't experience the cycles the way the story gets told.\n\nIn 2002-2006, I was broke, depressed, and at the end of my rope. At the time, everybody else, it seemed, was in salad days, the surge of government spending on war and houses were the new Beanie Baby-style investment fad had people in an expansive economic mood. \n\nMeanwhile, in contrast,  I had medical debt, credit card debt, student debt, and was living in impoverished conditions in an expensive city, renting sublet rooms, living on noodles, cheap beer, and regret.\n\nRight around the time the crash started in 2006, and for the next few years, I took a chance on a low-paying shift job in a field I wanted to enter. It sucked, but I slowly started moving up. At that time, I knew the economy was tanking. I recall at my firm walking in for the night shift, seeing unopened newspapers (paper!) with headlines touting massive bank failures.\n\nAnd yet, to me, nothing had changed for the worse. I had spent years working low-paying and contract gigs with people who didn't have any other option. Immigrants, people with criminal records, or just people like me who had been marginalized for other reasons, living on scraps, making do with less, and working a lot of hours to get by. One job cut people who did not work fast enough, sometimes in the middle of the shift. That happened to me. At one job I slept under my desk. \n\nThis wasn't glamorous or fair, and it isn't a brag--I dont feel these experiences are all positive, and treating workers badly is not justified. it's just that it was a lesson in humility and appreciation that I carry to this day.\n\nDuring the time when our economy crashed, through necessity, then as learned discipline, I paid off most of my debt, bought a house, and moved ahead in my career. I just kept chugging along. Although I was an older worker, I was overqualified, underpaid, and I had ferocious energy every day. Pro: no layoffs for me. Con: My salary never got even close to six figures.\n\nWhen I look at our wealthy culture now and contemplate the inevitability of cycles, I see the pain caused is real, but it is easy to forget the people who suffer the most in bad times are often the same people who were already left out of the wealth and security of the previous up cycle. And that turns out to be a lot of people.\n\nIf your goal is to be secure and stable, that's better than expecting to get rich quickly. Get and stay out of debt. Live within your means. Band together if you can. Keep simple goals. Times might be tough, but don't get psyched out by the common beliefs in up or down times.",

Each job I applied to had 6-7 HUNDRED other applicants in a town of less than150,000 people.... and while New York state *does* require a masters for certification, you have a window of time while teaching to get it completed. Something like 5 years if I recall correctly.\n\nI already had my shiny masters and was good to go, or so I thought. Well times were tough, and schools didn't want to pay the lousy 2 or 3 grand more per year they are required to pay for having a masters degree. (Remember this is almost 20 years ago, so that sum really was a dealbreaker). These were $30,000/year positions I was fighting for. I wish I was kidding. \n\nOver and over again I was told that I cost too much to hire with *no experience*. My particular masters program literally came with an extra year of (unpaid) teaching experience. It was so defeating. I was told by so many advisors in undergrad that I had better get that masters out of the way right after college, because I didn't want to uproot my life to go back to school to keep my job. Think of the family you might have! Your life will be so *rich* in 5 years, you won't want to go back to college. (Do men get this same lecture, I wonder? What if I was... pregnant by then? The horror!!!) I was also given the impression that no one hires a teacher who has to quit in 5 years to pursue more education. This was so misleading. There are many part-time programs, and lots of schools would have paid me to go just to keep me. \n\nFucking fuckers. I had graduated with honors, accomplished amazing community projects in student teaching, and had been groomed to be presentable. I followed all the rules. By October of 2009 I was stone cold broke and damn near broken. I applied at a bookstore and even they could afford to be choosy about who they hired. \n\nI had to compete to get a *minimum wage job* at a bookstore with a *masters degree in literature* and reading. (I think it was $7.25 an hour as minimum wage in my state had just increased from $4.50 to allot for the inflation)\n\nI actually really enjoyed working at Barnes and Noble for close to a decade, and eventually became a business manager for that company. But I had to claw my way there by creating a need within the framework for my position. That's the energy of a 24 year old. I.... don't have that energy anymore. \n\nI eventually left B&N to go back to teaching when the demand became high for teachers again. I won't take the side quest and share why I won't do *that* anymore... but suffice it to say I was chewed up and spit out by a broken machine. \n\nMake no mistake my young friends. The recession actually benefits big corporations and it by design keeps us subservient and quiet. They will cry and whine that they have no money and we all have to pitch in... but they all received major corporate bail outs and had the upper hand in all things from food and housing to entertainment. We were all so poor, that we accepted awful working conditions. We were constantly teminded how lucky we were to be employed. All because these same companies fired everyone at top tier because they were \"too expensive to employ\". Us youngins went in and ate shit with a smile because our (actual boomer parents born in the 1940s and 50s) told us we were damn lucky to have a job and encouraged us to get that debt with insurmountable student loans and mortgages with CRAZY interest rates. They thought $7.25 was an insanely high minimum wage, and we were all called soft for complaining. \n\nI remember trying to commiserate to my Dad about how broke I was after one particularly aggravating 42 hour [but only 40 in the books because overtime is frozen] work week. He asked me if I was on drugs? He genuinely thought that $7.25 should be enough to pay my student loans, mortgage, groceries, gas that was $4.50 a gallon (prior to this the most expensive gas had ever been was $1.99) to feed a 6 cylinder all gas car, insurance, and everything else a human needs to survive. Not live. Survive. I had to break down the cost of those things and show him how I was actually coming up $200 short each month on basic expenses. He looked at me like I was a fool for paying these prices but... well you all know. That was the cost of living that boomers were so out of touch with. I low-key get frustrated hearing very young people calling folks in their 50s a boomer. The actual **boomers** were post-WWII babies who were raised by two wars and great depression surviving parents, and well they were a little bit different ya'll. Generational trauma marked all of us from that shit. \n\nI sometimes think about the advisor who told me I wouldn't want to get pregnant or start a family and then  juggle school (women who expected a career were always called jugglers lol). He worked for an institution absolutely rolling in cash. And he convinced me to give them another $65,000 of my future income so I could have that family in the next five years. \n\nThat's also why so many of us say we were tricked into our student loan debt. Think of your average 20 year old. Can they make decisions like this responsibly? Would they understand terms like \"balloon interest\" or \"consolidated\" vs \"unconsolidated loan\" debt? We were promised careers that would pay off these pesky little loans in 5 or 10 years, and by then we'd be really living the high life because we went to allllll the college. \n\nThe truth is, I am a 40 year old unmarried woman with no children... I've been working and working and working and I'm tired. I have massive student loan debt today. My credit is in the shitter. I was in a pileup back in December, and my car insurance just dropped me. I can't even afford to replace the car yet, and now I can't afford to keep the state mandated insurance on one if I did manage to procure one. \n\nThere were a few okay-ish years when I had a semi-decent car and felt like a real grown-up back in 2016-2020.... but the last 2 have been real gut punchers and that security I worked to build up is all gone. I'm sorry it's happening again you guys. I wish we had done more to stop it but man I swear we were all too busy trying to survive the hell we inherited.",

            "body": "\nPay attention to the phrases. Back in 2009, people would say, \"no one wants to work anymore.\" They would guilt us for wanting extra pay for overtime. There was a ton of pressure to be loyal and thankful to your bosses. Many companies switched from hourly wages to salaried ones so that they could maximize on loyalty and eliminate the possibility of overtime. Another phrase was \"Hey, at least you have a ______\"... and you can insert literally anything that person has to make them feel shit for surviving. Could be home/job/car/education/family. Even our colleagues got in some weird contest about who had it worse... and it was like a badge of valor to sacrifice for the workplace. You guys, don't do that to eachother! It's not honorable to accept shit. It's shit no matter how it's served to you. \n\nBut to your point. This feels the same. If I had advice to give young people it is to avoid debt at all costs. Go to the trade school. Do your very best to live within your means. Avoid the new phone/car/clothes in lieu of something solid, reliable and affordable. Save up for a trip and travel within your budget instead of impulse splurging on a cruise that adds $5,000 to your outstanding credit. (God I sound old!!!) But do not incur a debt that requires you to work additional hours or jobs to maintain or pay off. This is how they control you and rob you of your freedom. Do not, under any circumstances, wait to enjoy your life when you can afford it. That is what they want. You sacrifice your body, your mind, your resources to stay employed and you miss out on campfires, babies, walks in park, enjoying holidays, and experiencing the joy of creating art or engaging in hobbies. \n\nWork to live kids, not the other way around.",

They had a round of lay offs, but it was mostly middle mgmt and the most highly-paid senior-level employees who got canned, so I stuck around.\n\nGas got really expensive for a while. Though I lived in truck country, I drove a little Mazda Protege, so I wasn't caught in up the frenzy of panic-selling a gas-guzzler like a lot of folks I knew. In late 2008 I bought a really cheap 3/1 800sqft house in a questionable part of town because mortgage rates were cheaper than paying rent, and two buddies of mine agreed to move in with me and pay rent and their share of the utilities. I was the one who bought because I had an ok credit score in the low 700s and rates were crazy low because they were trying to kickstart the economy.\n\nAfter the economy had largely recovered, I still kept getting excuses about how things were \"bad\" when I'd get little 1% raises every year, which with inflation meant I was effectively getting paid less every year. It was the impetus I needed to GTFO of that job and that town and move over 1000 miles away.

            "body": "I lived at my parents place in Florida at the time. I was 20 years old. Florida started feeling the recession a little before 2008 and the recession made a bigger impact in Florida than many other places.\n\nI had to pay for school so I was already working, though from 16-20 I ran through a wide array of jobs. Lucky for me, mid 2008 I found a job that was recession resistant. I worked for a company that was contracted out by hospitals to replace medications used by indigent patients by using the pharma company's patient assistance programs. \n\nEven then, I was still living at home. So I watched my Dad get forced into an early retirement from being a firefighter and I saw my Mom stress about workforce reductions, though she was never laid off.\n\nFlorida's housing market took a major hit. My parents received $700k+ offers on their home at the peak. But by 2009 or so I'd say 1/4-1/2 of the homes in their neighborhood were for sale. I'd often take drives down the beach in Pinellas county and you would see for sale signs the whole way. Literally hundreds of for sale signs the whole drive down the beach.\n\nI had plenty of friends move away due to parents losing their livelihoods. A bunch of my friends turned to crime and I no longer have contact with anybody from that period because a lot of people ended up in prison or dead (ODs, killed during a crime, suicides). A lot of divorces too among my friend's parents.\n\nI managed to keep my job throughout. Took my time in school since the job market was shit anyways. I also turned to crime to make ends meet at a certain point and I moved out of my parent's place in 2010. Things worked out for me but I was an exception compared to everyone I knew.\n\nThe biggest advice I can give, and you'll really have very little power over this, but do your best to stay employed during a recession. If you can manage that you'll come out the other end okay. \n\nAlso, after a major recession like 2008, it never felt like another one wasn't coming. It has always stayed in the back of my mind. My wife and I bought our first home in 2015 for $230k. I looked at it and figured there's no way it'll ever go below $190k and I can stomach that kind of loss, especially when the mortgage isn't any more than rent. And that's how I looked at buying a home, how much would I expect this house to go down? What's the minimum it could get to?\n\nI even thought a recession was likely to happen in the next couple years at that point. But I ended up selling that home last year for $450k. So don't be so quick to think a recession is actually going to happen either. We won't know until we're in it or maybe even until we're out the other side of it.",

It resulted in a pay cut and I had to move to a worse place with roommates.\n\n  \nIn 2013, I finally took the \"backup job\" of being a teacher (no, it's not a backup job, but it was literally sold to me as one. i.e. I was called up by this school district and asked to come interview. should have been a red flag). So, there I was in a career I never intended, that you really need to love to do, in a different state, making about the same money as Applebee's, except I had health insurance!\n\nThings have gotten better for me since.  I am no longer a teacher (thankfully), it definitely wasn't for me, but it puts into perspective the desperation of the time.",

            "body": "I was about 13 in 2008, dad was recently held by I.C.E. and sent to Texas, three states away. He was eventually released back to the states as he had a greencard blah blah blah. Doesn't matter. Point is when he got back like ~a year later, everything is fuzzy, in 2009; he had no job.\n\nDuring the time he was held, my mom fell into a deep depression with 5 kids. She was a stay at home mom with kids ranging from ~16-6. My parents had a little nest egg because my dad had a really good job at Micron plus they had help from her mom, my grandmother. So we were able to float until he got back.\n\nBut that stopped after my grandmother told her to pick between leaving my dad and her. My mother stupidly picked my dad, an abusive man, instead of security for her and her children.\n\nSo, because it was a recession with no jobs around, we lost the house due to foreclosure, moved into a hotel, and stayed there for awhile. We almost moved in with family but they didn't want my oldest brother, now 18, to be there. \n\nSo we stuck together.. only for him to move out a few months later, after we were able to get government help to move into an apartment. My other brother also left because he was smoking weed and got caught. Since we had government help with the apartment we could be inspected at any time. It was a huge issue for illegal drugs or unauthorized people to be there. So instead of quitting he left. \n\nFood was scarce, I remember trying to make \"seasoning soup\", which was just seasoning and water, because my younger brothers and I were so hungry. Of course it wasn't edible...\n\nSometimes my younger brothers stole bread so we had something to eat. The only upside to the food situation was school. Because we were low income we had free school lunches. If you arrived early enough to school there would be \"free\" breakfast because someone of the kids who could afford breakfast left part of their food in a bin we were able to pick out of. I remember hoarding these packaged muffins because I was so scared of not being able to eat and not knowing when I'd be able to get more. We were only able to pick two items from the food bin, so I would eat one in the morning and take the other back to the house for my younger brothers.\n\nIt just kept getting worse. My father got on disability for a plethora of issues he had, I guess we were lucky because that was the income we had. However, he would get bored being in the small apartment all day and would terrorize us when we got back to the apartment. He wouldn't allow my mother to work due to his controlling nature. With the lack of income we usually stayed inside. Due to the apartment being in a sketchy area it wasn't exactly safe to go out. \n\nI really became a recluse which still affects my life to this day. My previous lack of food security is always on my mind. And I am still so scared of being homeless again. \n\nTldr: dad lost job, got more abusive. Then between no food and not being able to go anywhere it wasn't a good time.",

There was a lot of stuff going on with interest rates, but it varied a lot based on location and type of loan. But obviously when your mortgage quadruples a lot of people couldn't keep their homes and/or were settled with a lot of debt. Which was also pretty sucky for those people and ruined lives.\n\n I just graduated that spring. I went near graduation with two job offers waiting and expecting a few more to come with a degree that had pretty much guaranteed a job for many years. To graduating with no job prospects and none of my course mates having any jobs in related fields either. A couple of them were at McDonald's, at a gas station, retail or whatever. But just a handful of us. I was promised a job at a place in March, and by August it was shut down forever. It had been there for decades. \n\n But for people who didn't get fired, who didn't get fucked in the loans, who weren't just entering the job market... Things didn't change much. It was honestly one of the most alienating parts. Things went on like normal for most people, as if nothing had changed. And we kept getting advice that was no longer applicable at all.\n\n Over the years as so many people got desperate, it started showing in the eroded work conditions. Hourly contracts, working week to week, working multiple jobs to get the hours in and get something to put on your resum\u00e9. Not being able to complain or argue for a raise without being fired on spot. While the older full timers continued pretending nothing had changed.\n\n And none of that has been fixed since, even if the job market recovered some and most people seem to realise that things aren't as easy as they used to be.",

Then my home which had a 1st and 2nd for $450K balance (home was worth $655K) dropped in value to $189K. I unfortunately had a CountryWide Mortgage and when Bank of America took over Countrywide, they used a provision in my contract to demand payment of note in full (clause was if home value dropped below 50% of note).

I lived through the 2008 crash, and I can tell you\u2014it wasn\u2019t pretty.\n\nIt started with job losses. People who had been with companies for decades were suddenly unemployed, and it didn\u2019t matter how good you were. If your department got cut, you were gone. New grads? They couldn\u2019t find work anywhere. Even those of us who held onto our jobs had to deal with pay cuts, hiring freezes, and fewer hours. Everyone was walking on eggshells, wondering if they\u2019d be next.\n\nThen there was the housing crisis. That was brutal. Foreclosures swept through neighborhoods like wildfire, leaving empty houses on every block. Home values tanked, which meant even if you kept your house, you probably owed more on your mortgage than it was worth. Some people just walked away, figuring there was no way out.\n\nMoney got tight\u2014real tight. We all had to cut back. Eating out became a rare treat, vacations were out of the question, and people started couponing like it was a survival skill. Essentials like gas and food got more expensive, stretching budgets that were already strained. Every trip to the grocery store was a reminder that a dollar didn\u2019t go as far as it used to.\n\nRetirement accounts? Gone, for a lot of people. The stock market crashed, and folks who had been planning to retire suddenly found themselves working another decade just to recover.\n\nThe stress was constant. You could see it on people\u2019s faces\u2014the uncertainty, the exhaustion. Marriages cracked under the weight of financial strain. Anxiety and depression weren\u2019t talked about much back then, but they were everywhere.\n\nPeople got creative, though. Side hustles, odd jobs, under-the-table work\u2014whatever it took to get by. Bartering even made a comeback. And despite everything, communities pulled together. Food banks were overwhelmed, but they kept people fed. Families moved in together to save money. Neighbors helped each other however they could.\n\nThe recovery was slow. Even when the headlines said things were getting better, it sure didn\u2019t feel that way. Wages stayed low, and a lot of people never really made it back to where they were before the crash.\n\nSo, if things are starting to feel familiar, I\u2019d say this: Save what you can, get rid of unnecessary debt, and make yourself as indispensable as possible at work. If you can, find a second way to make money, even if it\u2019s small. And most importantly, look out for the people around you. Hard times don\u2019t last forever, but the way we treat each other during them? That sticks.\n\nTake care of yourself,\n\nA Survivor of 2008",

And this was back when I was in my mid-20s and could live pretty cheaply. No idea how I\u2019d manage a situation like that now that I have kids, and now that the social safety net is even less secure than it was then. Fingers crossed, I guess.",

Finally I just showed up and demanded the money since it had been six months at this point.\n\nMy mom finally snapped and told me it was gone because it was either spend my money or be homeless with my preteen brother and even had the audacity to demand i not be mad about it and eventually never mention it literally ever again.\n\nThey never apologized.\n\nThe worst part after the gut punch of how much interest was going to be, was that if they had just asked me i more than likely would have said yes. They said they were entitled because they cosigned and have never stopped bitching about paying it back even though they're the ones that fucking spent it, they constantly complain about barely affording to pay back \"My\" loan also despite me paying off at least 5 years of it and getting another 5 deferred.\n\nMy parents brand new house at the times' foundation had cracked in half not long before too. All the houses on the ridge were cracking too, just not as bad as my parents but somehow my mom convinced the building company's CEO to replicate her's before he took off with everyone's money.\n\nBut he never put the new house in my mom's name, so during the recession the bank tried to foreclose on their first house and tried to evict them from the replica. They eventually came to a deal with the bank somehow after my stepdad found a job with a significant pay cut after 9 months unemployed. They transferred the mortgage from the first house to the second under the agreement that they would then \"sell\" the first house to the bank.\n\n(It should've been condemned but it's still standing today somehow.)\n\nThey got on their feet eventually and didn't suffer much more after, at least not due to the recession anyway. My stepdad got work eventually although he realized that he would have to work until he was 70 to get even again but didn't discuss it with my mom who would've told him he's an idiot if he thinks he'd be able to get/keep a job that long since there's almost nobody in computer tech in their 60's his current age.\n\n(ETA: He got fired with no explanation two ish weeks ago after protections went away and had been dealing with ageism beforehand. Since I'm now 100% reliant on him, my future is even more bleak now yay.\ud83d\ude43)\n\nBut I unfortunately never dug myself out of the hole the recession put me in and was homeless a third of that time and constantly couch surfing, with the exception of one single year, 2015 going into 2016 I finally got my own place for awhile before I had to crash once again with a friend due to being laid off.\n\nAnyway I got a restaurant job not long after the loan debacle and worked my way up to manager in various other stores. During that time I heard countless stories about people being too overqualified for menial jobs, like the example in my TL;DR. \n\nGroceries also went up exponentiallly at this time, and fish was scarce and crazy high marked up due to the Gulf Spill around that time, while the coast was STILL not recovered from Katrina a few years prior. Gas got up to just under $5 ($1.25 before, $3 now for comparsion) were I was, and had been climbing higher then I could have ever imagined steadily beforehand.\n\nWe lost a lot of kitchen workers during that time, some disappeared overnight with rumors that they fled to there home country or were deported and I'm not entirely sure why.\n\nIt was a really awful time for everyone unless you were moderately rich basically.\n\nAnyway I worked in the restaurant industry and did event work (10-20 hr shifts sometimes and that didn't even make ends meet long enough to make a difference in my living situations) until my body finally started giving out, tried to get into tech so I could work from home but my illnesses were so severe that I had arthritis in every joint in my body by the time it was found.\n\nWhat led me to that diagnosis was the week I completed a med tech course I was drugged and sustained injuries consistent with being hit by a car going 30-40mph while it's presumed I was trying to find help, ended with both a traumatic brain injury and traumatic bodily injuries (bone bruises) too. \n\nThe extra depressing part was I had been pre-approved for a house all on my own and had been offered a job good enough to pay the same week before that happened. For three whole days I really thought I was finally free, finally independent and had planned to isolate myself from my old life and start fresh. \n\nSix months after that I was 100% bedridden with long covid for almost ten months. Since I started to recover from then (4ish years ago) I've only returned to 50% bedridden can only stand unaided a few minutes at time get winded crossing a room etc, get random bouts of narcolepsy every few months on top of chronic fatigue.\n\nI haven't been able to work for going on six years.\n\nThe recession maybe solely didn't ruin my life like it did for a lot of others, but it was a huge contributing factor at minimum and the initial catalyst forat maximum.",

While recessions hurt a lot of people, it hurts some more than others.\n\nIf you're relatively young, which I assume most people are in reddit, then most likely you will have a job. Unemployment was at 10%. That would mean 1 out of 10 people would be out of a job. Most people who suffer are people who are in the service industries. They will be affected the most and the industry that will take the longest amount of time to \"get back\" when the economy will be recovering.\n\nTo be honest, it will be a stressful time. There will be a looming feeling that you are next. There will be no pay increases. This all will contribute to the \"tighten up the belt\", which hurts service industries.  Hours will be cut because people are not eating out, buying things, etc.\n\nHere are some tips that i've saw over the years:\n\n1. Do not check your retirement accounts and continue to contribute if you are able to. The markets goes up and down but the market usually recovers and growth usually will come right after. The term \"buy the dip\" comes from this. Do not check the value of any of your asset - it doesn't do anything with the mental health.\n2. Always be networking but its more important now than ever\n3. Build up a liquid safety net - if you do get laid off or out of a job, then make sure you have 5-6 months of liquid cash. With unemployment + safety net then you should be able to have money to cover your fixed expenses and food till you find another job.\n4. Mental Health - make sure you take care of yourself. Have a group of trusted people that you can talk to whether its professional help or friends who are supportive. I dont know if reddit is the best place except supportive subreddits. Reddit can be an echo chamber of doom. That's not going to be a good place for mental health.\n\nIn life - the average person goes through 1-2 recession every 10 years based on data. Most of time, it is a small dip that is forgotten. Sometimes its a much bigger one. It's good to just always plan for this.",

            "body": "What I remember most about the 2008 Financial Crisis; aside from the housing crash, businesses closing and people losing their jobs, and veterans getting screwed after their services in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 were the drugs. \n\nThis was when opioid use was *EXPLODING* (Pennsylvania is Top 15 in the country for opioid overdoses) and people were getting more into prescription pills like Xanax and OxyContin. My poisons were Paxil, Percocet, and gallons of hard liquor. I\u2019m sure that I would\u2019ve had to dropout of university eventually due to my drug addictions, but catching H1N1 (\u201cswine flu\u201d) and missing over two weeks of classes made my life unravel a lot faster. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was stuck at my parents\u2019 house in Oklahoma was when I decided to get clean \u2014 but only after a failed attempt at overdosing and killing myself. Quitting these drugs and recovery was probably the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do physically. I was noticeably becoming fat, but I lost over 60lbs after quitting and got back into playing soccer. Still had the very-slight-but-noticeable \u201cbrain jolts\u201d from Paxil for another three years before they went away for good (they weren\u2019t frequent, I would notice a \u201cjolt\u201d once every, like, 6 or 8 months). I came back to college in 2012 and graduated in 2015 (and earned grants/scholarships to study in Germany for a semester as a bonus).\n\nBut I\u2019m part of the lucky ones who were able to quit drugs and be functional thereafter. I\u2019ve lost a lot of friends from overdosing and suicide during this time \u2014 a good portion were veterans. I know some people who started their drug addictions during the 2008 Financial Crisis and never quit; some moved on to harder drugs and died a few years later even when the Economy was recovering. \n\nI\u2019ll always remember this era as \u2018The Hard Prescription Drug Epidemic\u2019. This was when the Sackler Family and the other Pharma Elites made their fortunes with the blessings of both Democrats and Republicans in Government, all while communities were being destroyed by their addictive products. I know that drug addictions are worse now than in 2008, but 15-20 years ago was uniquely bad for so many reasons.",

Lest we forget, media and market pundits were crying at the turn of the New Year that the market will likely wane this year because the growth up to this point over the last several years has been simply ludicrous.\n\nSo basically and very seriously: Don't worry.

There was a brief period where wages went up nicely but then cost of utilities and food went up shortly after.",

Many parents had lost their jobs and kids had to sign up for school lunch aid or often disappeared because their parents moved away for work. The news was endlessly bad and it seemed the United States would be surpassed by China any day now. I remember my principal ranting about his home being \"underwater.\" People forget but the homeless encampments all over California really sprung up during this time.\n\nMost of all I remember my millennial siblings unable to get a job right out of college. They were working really low level, entry level jobs as baristas and department store workers. They would hand in resumes with technical degrees on them at grocery stores. 2008 was a gloomy time, only brightened by the victory of Obama at the end of the year but 2008 - 2011 were some very unpleasant days, economically.\n\nIt all recovered around 2013.

He was six figures upside down the last time we ever talked.\n\n- had multiple older co-workers who had to delay their retirements by years because they had lost as much as 40% of their portfolios. One lady had planned to retire in 2012, and the last I ever heard of her she was still working in 2019.\n\n- Doom and gloom was everywhere. I listened to a lot of NPR, and there were multiple shows about how desperate things had become for some people. Best one I know of is the one in the link. It\u2019s long, but has great insight into what was going on in Las Vegas, which had been really blessed by the boom, then really cursed by the bust.\n\n[Foreclosure City](https://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/foreclosure/index.html)\n\n- Felt like it took forever for things to feel normal again. It was maybe 2011 when things were looking up again. My SIL graduated from a top public university in 2010 and couldn\u2019t find anything beyond fast food work (no judgement on fast food workers here).",

My SO was let go from his job that year, and there was a period where we were utilizing food pantries. There were a lot of foreclosed houses.

So many businesses and industries folded, jobs and so much money disappeared over night.\u00a0\n\nI was just getting ready to graduate college and hit the job market. It was really scary. It felt like the Great Depression the day the stock markets started crashing. Retirees got scared and cashed out of their 401ks and took massive hits. (That was a common anecdote heard it almost weekly.) several of my friends decided to stay in college and go get their masters. They didn\u2019t think they would fair well in the job market.\n\nEntry level jobs were very hard to find. Massive layoffs were taking effect. Every job for starting professionals, you were competing with people who had 5-10 years experience who were desperate to take any job. I desperately wanted to be out of my parents house and on my own.\u00a0\n\nI graduated spring of 2009. My full time job was applying for jobs. I spent 8 hours a day searching for jobs, tailoring applications, sending in resumes and hearing absolutely nothing for 6 months. In hindsight 6 months felt like an eternity but it wasn\u2019t awful.\u00a0\n\nI took the first job I could get that was even remotely related to my field. It wasn\u2019t great. But it was something. And then in 2010, \u00a0I took the next job that was closer related to my job . And that was better, but it also sucked. And I worked as hard as I could in that shitty job for 2 years until I could get the next leg up at the next shitty job. And it wasn\u2019t until 2015, 6 \u00a0years after I graduated , until I was a mid range specialist at a good job. I worked 50-55 hours a week while my friends were out enjoying their 20s because I was trying to compensate for the ladder I was struggling to climb at the start of my career.\u00a0\n\nIn 2008- House prices crashed. And I spent 4 years kicking myself I didn\u2019t have the cash flow to get into the housing market. And then another 5 years feeling like I could never get into the market ever. \u00a0I barely had the cash flow for anything other than rent. I didn\u2019t have insurance, and at the time the new Affordable care act came in with an insurance mandate. And I was so frustrated. I didn\u2019t have the money to contribute to my 401k, I didn\u2019t have it for health insurance, a work wardrobe, furniture\u2026\n\nIt got better. It took a while but it got better.\u00a0\n\n(Compared to the 2000s and the dot com bubble, I was in high school and I was completely sheltered from any observable effects of a recession. )",

Shortly after the recession, my step father lost his job and had to start looking for a new one. My father, who sold steel, was dirt poor the whole time and could not afford child support. Eventually, we lost our house and had to move into a condemned house.  \n\nMy step father got super abusive to us kids, he ended up kicking me out because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want a faggot living in his house\u201d. He also kicked my straight older brother out earlier that year, so I\u2019m pretty sure it was just because he was financially stressed and an asshole and was weaponizing his Christianity because it was cheaper not to provide for us. My father relapsed into alcoholism and started abusing his new wife. Because of this, he was mostly out of the picture during his relapses and I had to provide for myself as a teen.\n\nAfter being homeless for a while and working at Walmart to provide basic housing, College finally came around for me. A few hard years later, I graduated and was accepted to college, but my father didn\u2019t have the credit to co-sign a loan for me, so I just went one year and ended up dropping out with a large amount of debt the second. The next five or so years, I taught myself web development and software engineering (before boot camps) because I needed a way to fend for myself. I made it and have a successful career.   \n\nRecessions are hard in ways that you don\u2019t imagine. It\u2019s easy to boil it down to finances, but when people are on the edge of providing for themselves, they can become desperate and cruel. It is possible to fend your way through it and make it even if you think you can\u2019t. A lot of the luxuries go away, but if you\u2019re adaptable, you can learn resilience.  \n\nOne thing I remember was the occupy Wall Street movement, which lead to both the tea party movement and Obama being elected. People without means did rally\u2026 and rallied across party lines. It\u2019s a shame that they were immediately divided by a black man becoming president, but that\u2019s how the rich stay rich.

Lots of buy one get one free type stuff.\n\nI remember going to a Six Flags in SoCal and waiting a maximum of 5 minutes to get on just about every ride there, it was so sparsely crowded. So many rollercoasters. Loved it. Threw up all over myself in front of a girl I liked at the time afterward, which wasn't great, but still, lots of rides I never would have been able to get on in one day. We went on practically 90% of them. They even gave us half off coupons as we were leaving. It remains to this day the best theme park experience I've ever had. \n\nAlso, stocks and housing were very cheap. I was too young and broke to take advantage of it at the time, but hopefully if it happens again, I'll be more prepared.\n\nOther than that, it sucked. It was a very rough time, even for people with jobs, and it likely crippled my ability to move up in my then field at the time, which I ended up being booted out of just as the recession was coming to an end. Recessions are only good if you have money/a secure job and can take advantage of the downturn. Then they're actually better than good; they can set you up for life if you invest well.

We didn\u2019t own any stocks so seeing the market on the nightly news all in red for months on end was scary but it didn\u2019t affect us until 09.

Our house value reached even again in 2015. Right around the time prices started to really shoot up again and houses around us were selling in days instead of months or years. \n\nLike I said we were lucky but we also didn\u2019t over extend ourselves and made sure to have as much cash on hand in savings to weather the storm. Also my wife is a teacher and even though she doesn\u2019t make much it was a stable job that gave us a stable income until my business picked back up. \n\nWhat you don\u2019t want to do is get foreclosed on.

Becoming vegetarian makes things easier. Learn to cook. Cancel subscriptions. Reduce consumption. Tighten your belt. Put yourself out there with the jobs. Sometimes let go of your pride if it means food on the table. And hold on and try to ride it out. Keep growing your skillsets. Compassion becomes everything.

            "body": "A lot of what's already been said in this thread hits hard for me. I won't repeat what others more or less have said, but I'll add my own UK perspective here.\n\nIn short, it was a horrible, depressing experience that ruined all of prospects for my dream job, irrevocably changed my health both physically and mentally, and has placed me in debt for the majority of my working life. I wouldn't want this on my worst enemy.\n\n\nRecession happened in '08, I graduated summer of '09 in a niche but well sought out degree that could lead to a strong career in civic duty. Back in '08 we didn't even know what was happening. We had our own little bubble concentrating on our degree, ensuring our projects and assignments were in on time. Including thinking about our dissertation for next year. \n\nThere was no time to view what was happening in the outside world. \n\nCome to the end of our 3rd year, all students (roughly 20) applied for the position at the one government department that is 1 of 3 places in the UK that trains people into this career. The other is a commercial company, and the last is military. \nWe put through our applications, all bar 1 was rejected.\n\nWe were astounded, confused, and very. fucking. angry.\n\nWe were told from day 1 of joining this course, \"since you've made it here already, you're a shoe in for the government role.\" And \"they [goverment] just scoop you up at the end of the 3rd year because it's a cycle of their older colleagues retiring and them needing fresh faces!\"\n\nAll of it bollocks.\n\nI dreamed that as soon as this role opened up, I'll apply and happily be with this place for the rest of my life. Have the opportunity to work around the world, see places i never could growing up. All of that shattered. \nThis especially hits hard when we all had to take out loans to pay for tuition for university. We were the first generation that had to have them, and the tuition prices got WORSE, and still are, for kids now. \n\nReader, university was more or less free before 2000.\n\nWe thought, \"that doesn't matter, we'll get the job we wanted and work it off!\".\n\nNope.\n\nThe recession ruined the job market in a sense that the first thing to go were entry-level jobs and any training programs to up skill new employees. \n\nIf you were a graduate you had no chance less you had nepotism on your side. \n\nI was still hopeful though to get my dream job. \nI took contract job after contract job, travelled to where the work was, part time after part time job. I even went across the world to get a VOLUNTARY position for 3 months, paying out of my own pocket, to get real experience in the job I wanted. \nEventually, I got noticed, and in the interview, they couldn't care. Because it was a *voluntary* position. Not a real job so doesn't count for real experience.\nThis role was for a trainee position. A role you'd be *trained* in. Yet they wanted experience.\n\nFor 3 years I tried. My physical and mental health took a downward spiral.\n\nMy parents were still working so they dodged a bullet. Though they made things worse because they couldn't understand why I couldn't find a job. Looking at me filled with resentment because it looks like I was being \"lazy\". \nFor a small time they pressured me to get on the dole (welfare). It was the most humiliating experience. You're given a diary and told to write down all the attempts you made to get a job, also they need to know how much you have in your bank accounts and what you're situation is. Living with your parents and have all this money (less than \u00a32k)! We'll give you \u00a320 a week.  \n\nThe people that work at the welfare treat you like you're incompetent vermin that is wasting the country's resources. Except for 1 lady who said \"Look at this Shirley! I've had an astrophysicist, a geologist, and now OP! What is going on?!\" She at least noticed a pattern of highly skilled people not working after graduation. \n\nWe were all told they same thing on this side:\n\"Get a degree! Doesn't matter what, you can go far with a degree!\"\n\"If you don't study hard now, you won't achieve anything in life!\"\n\nThen after the recession it just flipped, fortunately I was spared the \"why did you get a degree in that?!\" Since people saw the value in it. But instead got:\n\"Nah, you should have gone into trades. It's where the moneys at.\"\n\nMy seventh interview attempt for my dream job was the last. I was waiting in the familiar atrium of this place and this cocky twat sits down next to me to answer a phone call. After his call he asked me what I was hear for. Told him for the trainee role. I asked how long he'd been in here and how he found it. \nHe shrugged like it was the easiest job to apply for. \"I did my degree in [something completely different than what OP did], didn't matter though. My uncle has a job here and put in word for me.\"\n\nAfter the latest rejection I had to sit down and look at what I had achieved over the last 3 years. I had to give up my dream. It was devastating. No amount of work was ever going ti cut it unless i knew someone high up in the government department. ANDthe job market was STILL against graduates. \n\nNow I've had ti worm in a field which I don't particularly like because i needed money, dealing with idiots who don't know their arse from their elbow, and the prospects of applying for a different job sector with the same pay you're on are non-existant because you don't have the relevant experience. \n\nMy mother went from being a bank teller to working in a pharmaceutical company with zero qualifications, no degree, and only their O-levels (think high school diploma). \nThe chances of doing anything similar now are astronomically low. Once you're in a sector, it's difficult to get out without making huge sacrifices.\n\nAll the problems you see right now when applying for jobs, the 5 years of experience for entry level roles, the shocking low-level pay, the running through hoops to get an interview and the circus the interviews are? They didn't exist before '08.\n\nI'll end it here because I could go on, and there is plenty more to go on. \n\nBut I'm going to end it like this: if there is any advice I can give, it's to push on and be adaptable.\n\nLook for the better things in life that don't revolve around work. Work should be the smallest part of your life. Companies want to give us pennies, then your effort will reflect this. \nWhen I came to this conclusion, everything changed around. I'm now married to a wonderful woman who means the world to me, and I have a 1 year old who'd I do anything for. \nMy current job isn't what I wanted but I do enough so that my mental health stays positive and I can always be there for my family.\n\nTHINGS DO GET BETTER. But it's up to you to make it better.",

Then my landlord went bankrupt, sold my appartment building to a soulless company that took every step to illegaly evict me, had to move to a new appartment twice the price, then wisdom tooth infection sent me to the emergency dentist. I was then officially broke af, depressed and racked a couple thousands on my credit card paying rent and bills with credit. When I gathered my courage to ask my boomer parents for some help (typical suburban middle-class of the 70s-80s, nurse and middle manager), they told me it was my own fault if I didn't worked for the past year and that I should file for welfare (that wasn't true, I had a couple of video editing gigs now and then but nowhere enough to pay the bills, and 'exposure' sure doesn't pay bills).\nIt took another 6 months to find a 'real' full-time job. Another 5 years to fully pay off debts as the new rent kept increasing. By 2017-2018 i was back on track to buy an appartment (forget about the house) but housing became so expensive I never reached my goal. Rents have gone up so much in my area my appartment is now relatively cheap. Arguably the cheapest place I could find without fleeing to the far reaches of suburbia and then I would have to buy a car ... so the 2008 recession kinda made me a renter for life as my best option for housing is to stay in my appartment and do the necessary to contest rent hikes.",

I was getting by with very little.  Just a computer, internet, small kitchen, small bathroom, a few personal belongings, no bed. No car.  I was slowly accumulating and building my life back up.\n\nThen a recession hit about six months later.  My hours were cut down to four days a week, then three days.  The options we were given were to either take PTO, go unpaid, or maybe fill in some hours with a department that had a need.\n\nI got incredibly fortunate to fill my hours with a job nobody wanted - working payroll with a lady everyone was afraid of.  She went through three assistants in something like seven months.  She had a reputation of just terrorizing people.  But, it was the best paying of all my options, so I took it.  \n\nIt turned out she really wasn\u2019t that bad \u2014 she just wanted everything done her way (which was 100% by the book), and she wanted everything done right.  She wanted to know you were a serious person before you could be trusted processing payroll for hundreds of people.  And if you made a mistake, she had a way of letting you know she was disappointed.  You just didn\u2019t want to make the same mistake twice.  As long as you took it seriously and aimed to do your best and your best was good, you were fine.\n\nIt began a career in Finance for me.  She\u2019s since been my lifelong advocate.  The recession was terrifying at first, but I\u2019m glad I was already in a transitionary period in my life and not like 2 years out from retirement or something.  I got incredibly lucky, and so many people around me lost so much.  It was a sad time, a difficult time.  And a weird period of growth for me personally.",

I stayed a contractor and they let me (and every other contractor) go when the project ended in 2 years. Luckily, by then some other companies were doing better so I got another contract job pretty fast. \n\nI never paid attention to how unemployment benefits work before 2008. It had never even crossed my mind. You learned quickly that it varies widely by state. You might $600 a week in one but $250 in another. I could almost barely survive on $600 but would lose everything quickly on $250. \n\nAnd then people who were going to retire mostly delayed their retirement, which removed a lot of good jobs from the job market for years. \n\nYou also heard a lot of stories about people who held a professional job, got laid off and basically never worked again.

Sure the Rich and Wealthy will be O.K. because they have money stockpiles, but the vast majority of your citizens will suffer.\n\nNow lets say you live in a country with 40 million people. And for some strange reason your major purchaser no longer wants to buy \"as much\" of your product. For some strange reason it has just become too expensive (tariffs). Well if you sit on your butt and do nothing then you too can expect to experience job loses. But if your Sales Team actively canvasses the World and finds additional buyers (eg.

Lets say that in both countries 10% of your work force suffers. 10% of 360 Million, is 36 Million People, while 10% of 40 Million is 4 Million people.

In 2006 at the height of the housing market, that was a cause of the 2008 recession, I bought a house and overpaid for it. I just sold that house and lost 25k on it. It was a mess and because I was so underwater it never gained value. \n\n  \nOverall, what that house and the recession taught me is that if you live within your means and can live simply, you can survive a recession.",

And he got tipsy and admitted to a group of acquaintances that he was drowning in debt between student loans, personal loans, car loans, and mortgage.  That the pressure to \u201ckeep up\u201d was making him more miserable than he ever was as a broke (by his standards-subjective given his background) college kid. I felt bad for him. I had extremely minimal debt, drove a beater used car, rented a room in a shitty old house. There was no pressure from my peers and I had no family of my own to worry about. I lived paycheck to paycheck, and drank and partied like a college kid to suppress any feelings of failure. \n\nThankfully I landed myself a career that I love in my late 20s and was decently successful by my early 30s. But I mean I\u2019m now 37 and only last year bought a house, married in 2022, had a baby in late 2022. So I\u2019m doing all the things you\u2019re supposed to do\u2026but about a decade and some change after my parent\u2019s generation did it. \n\nAnyway, all of this is to say that it hurts my heart that another generation is going to struggle needlessly, especially given that it\u2019s the same generation that I feel suffered the most from the isolation of Covid lockdowns.",

            "body": "At that time, I was 10 years into my career working in software for a company I didn't like. I didn't like the corporate culture. I didn't like most of the people there. I didn't like that I was just doing a job to make someone else money. But I figured it was just the psyche of my brain because everyone else around me treated it as normal.\n\nMy parents never really explained things like finances or home buying or any of those skills because I don't think they ever had any interest in learning it themselves. So, I learned all those things myself and couldn't figure out why other people were able to buy new cars every few years and houses that seemed to keep growing and growing. I could barely afford basic cars and we just moved from a small 2 bedroom house to a slightly bigger 3 bedroom house for my wife and our 2 kids. And the only reason we had the small house in the first place was a 50% cut of the inheritance of my wife's grandmother. Our 'lavish' vacations were road trips that went off in a direction and we stayed at inexpensive hotels along the routes and just found places around to check out.\n\nThen, in early 2008, I remember seeing articles about how people started letting their cars run out of gas on the highway and getting a free gallon from highway patrol. I saw a lot more posts on Craigslist of people selling bigger and more expensive items. More posts about \"take over the loan on my SuperHuge SUV\". More editorial cartoons with things like a family looking destitute with piles of credit card bills and then the father exclaiming \"I just found a giftcard to Applebees! Let's go!\"\n\nThen, in February, my job along with a lot of older workers at the company got cut. I got a severance. I'm not going to say that I was a good worker. Even then, I don't think I was. When I first started I was, but the 8 years of being tossed between team to team and the whole company being re-orged yearly wore me down quick. One year, I had 7 different managers. I demoralized hard. This just finished the job.\n\nI started applying everywhere. Careers.com, Indeed, LinkedIn. Got tons of calls with recruiters. I started getting desperate and would take any job. I tried to get a tech support job. I tried to get a fresh-outta college job. I spent my days waiting by the phone and checking my email every 30 minutes. Even sticking with a recruiter was hard as they kept losing their jobs as well. \n\nI applied for a job as a software tester. But since I had programming experience, the recruiter had me interview for a software programming job as well. The hiring manager was pissed that the recruitment agency had sent someone with 10 years of software development (8 of those being Java) for a job run that required Java Swing experience. \"Why do they send me a candidate that doesn't know Swing?!?!\" When I talked to the recruiter afterwards and how the hiring company was still interested in me in the testing position, I turned it down. I wasn't going that low.\n\nI applied more. I waited more. I turned my Nintendo switch into a music player so I could wait with music. I kept the house clean.\n\nI got a call about a job doing configuration management, which I was good at. I told the recruiter I was very interested. Never heard back.\n\nMore applying. More waiting. Severance checks ended.\n\nI got a call several more recruiters about the same configuration management position because I seemed like a perfect fit, but kept telling them some other agency applied me and I know some employers will bail if multiple agencies apply for the same person. One agency finally said \"Let me check with them to see if they actually applied for you.\" and found out that the original recruiter hadn't. So, he applied for me.\n\nI interviewed with the manager. I interviewed with the team. I interviewed with the director and got the job. I liked the job and the people. On top of that, I liked having an office with the quiet that made it easier to work.\n\nIt did finally feel like the sun coming out on a Summer day and that things would work. That fall, Disney was doing a deal where you go to Disneyworld and pay for 4 nights and get 3 nights free and the midtier dining plan was included. We looked at our finances and spent $3000 total on 4 plane tickets, 7 days at Disney World with meal plan, and stayed in a midtier on premises hotel, the Coronado? I think was the name (we would have gone cheaper, but the meal plan required midtier).\n\nSo, yeah, during that time, a lot of people reshuffled hard. One of the things I try to live by is knowing what you can \"afford\" vs what \"you have the money for\". Take out as little credit as you have to. Make things last longer. Don't be afraid of missing out/FOMO.\n\n2008 was an echo of 2000/2001 dotcom burst. Covid was an echo of 2008. This feels like an echo of Covid.",

They LOVE killing people. \n\nBut SAVING people, no that\u2019s not their bag. Saving the fortunes of the top ten percent and adding even more to the wealth of the top one percent, that gets you some awesome bipartisanship.

The truth is they did not want to help ordinary Americans save their homes, so they didn\u2019t. They let them foreclose on everyone and everything because the middle class was ordinary people who didn\u2019t look like a bunch of latte drinkers and they left them out on the streets to fend for themselves. I remember calling and calling and calling mortgage Servicers who would tell you yes we have the authority to modify your loan send me the paperwork. And then you would never speak to that person again but you would speak to another ten representatives and they would all ask for your client\u2019s paperwork because nothing was in the system and \u201cNo by golly, we won\u2019t go forward with that mortgage foreclosure as long as your request for modification is in the system, so send that paperwork immediately to the main email adddress right away. The next day the Auctioneer would show up but by then your client had no time or money to file a Bankruptcy petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court to postpone the foreclosure auction. It went on like this for years. Lenders foreclosing and that weakling Geithner doing everything for Wall Street investment banks, commercial banks and private equity companies. \n\nOrdinary people do not matter in a recession. They are so much cannon fodder for Lenders and Bankers and Credit Card companies and Private Equity firms. \n\nYOU DON\u2019T MATTER TO THE RULING POLITICAL CLASS. You never have and you never will and it becomes crystal clear when a recession begins. Expect nothing because that is exactly how much help you will get. There will be no emergency funds doled out\n(that\u2019s reserved exclusively for weapons manufacturers and mercenaries and proxies who kill black and brown people) there will be no foreclosure moratoriums there will be no new jobs. But there will be more tax cuts for the top ten percent so that even more money gets fed into the financial economy and less into the real economy on which 90% of Americans rely for economic survival. \n\nThis recession will be no different. You are all on your own. There just aren\u2019t enough resources to save the billionaires and to save Joe Six-Pack. Trust me it\u2019s a bipartisan thing. You are expendable and you are expected to die quietly. The billionaire class is exceptional and all our resources are at their disposal to save them from the merest discomfort. \n\nThat\u2019s what your life will be like in the oncoming recession just like it was under Bush-Cheney and Obama-Biden from 2007-20014.",

It wasn't sustainable.\n\nSo, we rented a UHaul and moved our little family across the country to at least be closer to family. We were able to stay with relatives for a couple months while my husband went on a million interviews. He finally got a good job in a trade that he had some experience in. We rented a small apartment and things were okay, for the most part. But we had to do a short sale on the house in Florida; we had purchased it for $140,000 and it sold for $35,000 or something like that. Thankfully, there was a tax break that meant we didn't have to pay taxes on the shortage.\n\nIt took several years to really get back on our feet all the way, and we didn't buy another home until 2014 (and thankfully we refinanced in 2021, when the rates were bottom of the barrel). We have been doing very well to this point, but my husband now works in construction and that's starting to fall by the wayside. There are many weeks that he only has work for 3-4 days. Also, I'm in marketing and AI is decimating the part of the industry I specialize in... so yeah. The signs are there that a recession, and possibly a depression, is looming. Scary times ahead.",

Finally landed a good job as a transportation broker in April of 2008. I worked at one of the worlds largest 3rd party logistics providers. I thought I was set for a career. I could watch the economy slow through the freight movement. At the time I was responsible for moving pallets used for shipping from their factory to manufacturers. Over the course of 2008 I had fewer truckloads of pallets to move. I got laid off in January of 2009. \n\nI didn't find work until February of 2010, and this job was part time. Well, it was 32 hours and paid all of $10 an hour. Eventually I would have to take another part time job to pay the bills, especially when my hours got cut after the passage of the ACA. I worked two part time jobs for until I landed a full time gig in the tourism industry in February of 2014. So I worked two part time jobs for almost 4 years. \n\nThe full time gig was in the tourism industry making less per hour, $9.75/hr, but full time with benefits. Luckily I was able to go back to school online and get a masters degree. I finally got a good job in 2017. So it took 8 years to recover from the Great Recession. I'll never truly recover from it when you factor in the lost retirement contributions and a late start on saving for a home (if I'll ever be able to afford one).",

That led to a huge boom in the financial industry. What we didn\u2019t know that it was all bs, bc it was built on many bad loans. Pre 2008 anyone could loan for a home without even having income. Many of these loans were ARM loans where the person could just afford paying off the interest every month. The issue was when the teaser rates expired the monthly payments ballooned into being unaffordable. A lot of these people weren\u2019t financially savvy and were told they\u2019d be able to refinance, but when home prices started going down they weren\u2019t able to and would eventually get foreclosed on. Which led to many financial institutions going under. Most were eventually bailed out by the government. \n\nWhat you\u2019re seeing here is a correction for the stock market. I wouldn\u2019t be worried about something like 2008 until we see the DOW go above 20% loss.",

I bought my house at peak market as I was under self imposed pressure that the way things were going in the housing market I would never be able to buy a house so I jumped.  \n\nWhen it all came crashing down it was a bit surreal.  Your best asset was a job.  I had one that was very secure.  But everyone outside of my industry and in my social circles were going broke, bankrupt, or burning through savings and 401ks.  The ones that managed to lose jobs in my industry, very rare but did happen, found it very tough to find placement within it again.   There were very well educated people with experience doing jobs just above minimum wage that were starter jobs.  Very little prospects to move up or on to other jobs that paid better.  Watched a number of small businesses fold, and normal industries that seemed to get by like residential home construction completely fold.  In my region there were a significant number of small home builders that just closed up shop and never opened back up.  Only ones that remained were the large megacorporate builders.  MLM exploded because everyone was looking for that side hustle to supplement income.  \n\nThings were uncomfortable for a few years but then eventually things started to feel noticeably better.  Those friends that blew through 401Ks were able to find positions where they could save again, etc.  That recession taught me about where I felt comfortable spending.  I already felt house poor, even though financials were in comfortable shape.  But I definitely learned not to over extend myself with excesses that I saw became boat anchors for others.   People that needed the latest electronics, biggest newest vehicles, extra toys like motorcycles jetskis boats or rvs lost those things with a quickness and they lost their shirts on them.  Nearly 20 years on, and with 20 more years in the work force, I actually know I will retireme as long as I don't lose my current job and find myself in a situation that requires tapping into those retirement reserves.  So the focus now is on building on hand reserves so that I can care a whole lot less about my job and maybe even work for myself or just retire early.  Need to be able to bridge the income between now and when I want to tap into my actual retirement.",

If the US is heading for recession now I don\u2019t see why anybody thinks it would be like the Great Recession. The White House is shooting itself in the foot by aggressively laying off federal workers (illegally I might add, the courts have ruled against them already and many have already been reinstated), freezing grants (also illegal and being reversed in the courts) that all US local municipalities rely on and threatening tariffs on US allies. Point being is that this recession looks more like an unforced error by a an old man who doesn\u2019t understand how tariffs work than a systematic financial collapse. The economy has good bones. Economists praised the US economy for pulling off a soft landing after Covid, something no other economy did successfully.

I turned out to be right, and now we're in the weird position where there's an entire missing generation of architects and I'm the first to come of age after that missing generation, so wind up getting hammered with work since the modestly older folks who would ordinarily be doing my job simply don't exist.\n\nIt's not worth freaking out about though. Fact is turn downs are natural- just need a plan and a cushion. Would also say they're as much opportunities as they are struggles- nothing to lose really means nothing to lose, or conversely, you may find it's time to settle down if you find yourself in a stable position. Also, fwiw- we've been having a white collar recession for the past few years now. A lot of knowledge economy jobs and fields have been hurting as a result of the high interest rates. Combine that with the COL crisis and a lot of people actually are feeling a stagflationary world right now.\n\nAt the end of the day, what will come will come and the world will still be spinning.

            "body": "For us life went on.  I had a main job and two part-time jobs; none was affected (thanks be to God).  Having multiple sources of revenue and (if necessary) insurance reduced much stress.  My 401(k) at the main job took a 25% hit; I did not liquidate, knowing it would eventually recover (I remembered the effects and the recovery from the 1987 crash).   Life just went on.  Contributing factors for us were minimal debt (paid off on time credit cards and a fixed-rate mortgage) and living below our income.  My wife did not work so I had the undivided pleasure of supporting our family.\n\nSome of our neighbors disappeared.  One week my wife noticed they had downscaled their cars to definitely used ones, and the next week they disappeared one night, never to be seen again: they walked away from their mortgages.   \n\nRemember that if you have saved cash, then a recession is awesome, like a Black Friday that lasts for months.  Major appliances, daily needs, cars, and real estate are cheaper.  Interest rates drop so you can re-fi your mortgage.   Stocks naturally decline as well, so it's a great time to buy if you have the discretionary funds.   (Parenthetically, Warren Biuffet  has a colossal cash hoard right now for this very reason.)  So reducing debt, saving cash, and tweaking your lifestyle are perhaps the best ways to prepare for a recession.  \n\nI've wandered a little from the main topic.  We lost none of our jobs.  Nor did siblings.   High-rollers and lifestyle millionaires took major body blows.  Things were cheaper.  But it was very unnerving to be reading incessantly about major corporate implosions like Lehman Brothers.  Collapses occur in other recessions, of course, but the lightning speed of obliteration in 2008-2009 really created the feeling that nothing and nobody was safe.",

You\u2019d only hear whispers about it through the grapevine.  \n\nI\u2019d see grown men on the Metro North, carrying boxes, tears rolling down their cheeks as their lives were thrown into disarray. Banks were going under, and we all thought the world was going to end.  \n\nThis feels different from \u201908 for me. In \u201908, there was panic\u2014full-on panic\u2014that the monetary system would collapse. No one was buying risk instruments or stocks, and banks weren\u2019t lending to anyone. It was a total no-risk approach by everyone.  \n\nThen came the bailouts\u2014banks, auto companies, and many other industries. The Treasury and the Fed were all hands on deck in NYC, setting up a \u201cwar room\u201d with the banks and extending liquidity via the Fed window to non-banks.  \n\nWhat I see now is bad, but not \u201908 bad. This slowdown is driven by consumer sentiment, inflation, and tariffs. Unfortunately, if consumers think the economy is going to tank, they tend to pull back on spending, which further weakens the economy. Add decreased government spending to the mix, and we could see a significant slowdown.  \n\nWhat happens next? In my view, companies will increasingly turn to AI, displacing more employees and leading to higher unemployment, underemployment, and a growing number of people without assistance.",

How can you gain years of experience working an entry-level job if you can't get the job in the first place? I would apply for things knowing that dozens of other people were applying for the same position. I had nothing that made me stand out, so applying for jobs felt like a cruel joke. I had friends with masters degrees working at gas stations or fast food restaurants because it was literally the only thing they could find. I heard stories of people unaliving themselves because trying to find a job was so depressing and humiliating.

New kind of work in a new industry. Boss was a friend of a friend, but because she knew I'd been fired and that I'd have a hard time finding a job if that one didn't work out, she became very abusive. She had sex with one of my boyfriends, had me call the men she was dating to break up with them for her, made me work a 20 hour day once, trash talked me to mutual friends. It was awful, and I saw no way out. \n\nThings did get better. We got a new boss. Old boss moved to a new department and was then fired. But as late as 2010, I remember going to a party, looking around the room, and realizing I was the only person there with a regular full time job.\n\nEdited: words",

My real estate agent at the time said \u201cit was fun- we could get an $1 million mortgage with nothing more than a finger print and signature\u201d. \nMany of these loans were balloon payments meaning they would be a fixed amount for a certain time and then the payment would go up significantly. Meaning, those people who shouldn\u2019t have been given a large loan couldn\u2019t pay it. That led to foreclosures etc. That caused the housing market to \u201cburst\u201d and a chain reaction of shit (to simplify it). \n\nThe issue then, at first, wasn\u2019t that you lost your job and couldn\u2019t afford your mortgage it was that you never should\u2019ve had that mortgage in the first place. This upcoming recession very well may be caused by job losses and whatever else fresh hell we have coming. Most people have solid mortgages or at least better than what was happening then. \n\nI think the only thing you can do now is have a plan and save every cent you can. I\u2019m a child of the early 80s, I\u2019ve lived on dollar store food before and can do it again. We\u2019ve cut back on a lot of things and are trying to build a safety net of 6 months of house and utility payments - that is very hard for almost everyone so don\u2019t feel bad if that is a large ask. Right now we only have about 1-2 months. It takes time. \n\nPlanning; I have it in my head what we will do if the shit hits the fan in our life\u2026from working whatever shitty jobs we possibly can, to using dry food we have stored (you might want to start picking up some canned goods, rice etc), all the way to selling our house if possible and moving, or just filing bankruptcy and moving- from not ideal to well fuck. \n\nRight now you can take a very real look at your budget. What are you spending money on? Print or export your bank statements and sort them by category. How much are you spending on entertainment, groceries, utilities etc. Then start cutting back and saving. It sucks but it gives you a sense of control in a situation you can\u2019t control. \nMake a plan. What will you do if specific things happen. \n\nDon\u2019t panic: get a realistic idea of your budget and make your best to worst case plans. Get comfortable with the uncomfortable of having to give up things to save. Oh and there is NO shame in moving in with friends and family again- I did it at 30 right after the 2008 shit storm and everything turned out ok. Take care of each other.",

And suddenly, on the cusp of college, my parents lost any ability to help me pay for it, and any faith that there would be a job for me on the other end. So they pushed me *so fucking hard* to get into an Ivy League school, to get a full ride, anything to not have made them liars who feed my childhood to the endless churn of achievement. I didn't succeed in any of those things. What I got was a solid scholarship to a very good art school. And when I visited a few weeks later, that was proof enough that *I made it*, even in this economic disaster. I had a chance of a future, and that was proof to them that they hadn't totally failed me.\n\nI bring this story up because it could so easily have been avoided by my parents being open with me about their fears. We could have talked about the unfairness of it all, and made reasonable contingency plans. It was well intentioned but massively short sighted and put me at odds with them when I really needed their support. Don't make their mistake with the people in your own life. \n\n--\n\nAlso, I distinctly remember sobbing in the fridge that first day back because there were two different kinds of cheese in the drawer, and that meant my parents were going to be okay. Scarcity mindset does weird things to people.",

I am not so bad off, now, but as long as my job remains, I'll be fine, because I am not overextended like a whole fuckton of people were in '08.  My money is not in assets that will significantly devalue, other than a tiny retirement fund from my previous employer.  The unfortunate side of that, is that my retirement fund is not enough to last me a year, and I should be retiring in about 15 years or so.  And the market will drastically affect that fund.\n\nIn '08 I was living with 7 people jammed into a house smaller than the one I bought in 2015 to house my family of 4.  It was really tight and we were barely getting by.  By 2012, I was making more income than I ever had, and that is still true.  \n\nI can't predict anything, though.

            "body": "Few things worth noting as that recession was different than others we had (and presumably will likely be different then this self-imposed one.)\n\n1.  Banks foreclosed and evicted people without due process until gov\u2019t put restrictions on it.  Our neighbor lost their house after 1 missed payment because bank of america didn\u2019t want to work with them.  Houses with lots of equity and small mortgages were grabbed along with people who were underwater.\n\n2.  It took some people 2-3 years to find another job.  I remember job fairs in my areas getting thousands and thousands of applicants for fairs offering 50-100 jobs max.   There was no severance for layoffs either so don\u2019t necessarily count on that even if it\u2019s in your contract. \n\n3.   Cash is king.   Banks and credit card companies protected themselves first.  Don\u2019t rely on available credit or home equity loans or anything to cover you.  When things get rough they will close or freeze your lines of credit, decrease your available credit, or close your account.   I worked in corporate banking during the last recession, we did this. \n\n4.  Metal robbers and theft were everywhere.  People got their gutters stolen off their houses.  People broke into abandoned homes to steal water tanks and wiring.  Lots of that went unreported because who cared if it was an abandoned home? We had all the metal placards for war veterans stolen from our local cemetery.    It was a bit of craziness i won\u2019t forget. \n\nSome good though:  we learned to grow veggies and fruit in our backyard during that time to save money on groceries.  The recession also brought about a lot of lost skills (canning, home brew, thriftiness).  Mutual aid became a necessity and that\u2019s always a good thing in a community.  There was a backlash on luxury spending and for a while after people prioritized savings, minimalism, thriftiness.   A lot more people started caring about their personal finances and side-gigs.",

The western lot was full most days and sometimes people (about 5-15 cars) would have to park in the eastern lot (sections D-F).  After the recession, there was plenty of room left in section C of the Muni Lot's western lot.\n\nGas prices were fantastic for about a year: <$2/gal.  In 2007, there were regular news stories on TV about how the drivers of full-sized Fords and Chevys and large SUVs with their 26-gallon tanks could hardly afford to fill them because it cost >$100 to fill the tank.  Dealerships could hardly keep small cars like Corollas and Civics in stock and used ones became expensive too.  Dealerships had a hard time moving the large SUVs and full-size pick-ups.  My neighbor sold his full-size Chevy for a mid-size sedan at the height of the gas prices.    \n\nEach major economic event has reduced the number of people parking in the Cleveland's Muni Lot: post-9/11 recession, Great Recession ('08), and COVID.  Although most downtown offices have returned from working from home (WFH), parking in sections A-1 through B-2 is full and there's several cars in section B-3.  Now that their WFH privileges have ended, I hope that federal workers will fill out B-3 and into C-1.  I don't know if we'll ever have an RTA route (formerly the C-line with a green trolley bus) stop at the Muni Lot ever again.  :'(",

To be honest, sometimes it didn't feel like it was happening on campus, which had a huge overrepresentation of students coming from families in the top 1% of household income.

As an adult, of course I see that this environment was so OUT OF TOUCH. Applying to internships for the summer was so annoying because so many of the available internships were not paid, which is just abusive. \n\nSo many people were unemployed or under-employed that the entry-level job market was ridiculous. Prospective employers wanted ridiculous things. I was lucky in the sense I could travel for job interviews and consider opportunities in other parts of the country, whereas many people didn't have that flexibility or a parent to bankroll them, so I was able to secure my first job in a relevant industry a few months after graduation. Wages were still so stagnant though; it took me a few years to make up ground. What really helped were policies that forbid asking about current/previous salary because that would have screwed me. \n\nI kind of attempted to get out of my social bubble back then, and it mostly made me frustrated and sad that everyone seemed broke to some degree. Like a colleague working full-time with a college degree yet need food assistance because companies were still too busy abusing new grads to pay them a reasonable wage. It was pretty disgusting.\n\nIt's the fault of our economic system idealized in a vacuum of  imaginary rational actors when there are simply many bad actors and the fault of ruling class propaganda about extreme individualism. I've personally seen so many wealthy kids make mistakes (because dumb youth) and later turn things around, but they have the privilege of being able to make those mistakes, learn from experience, and redirect.

I got a job at a university that was funded by the Recovery Act and he found a technical job with a small firm that manufactured materials for commercial construction. In 2009, we moved into an old house that was subdivided into apartments and got married. Things were looking up.\n\nThen in early 2010, our landlord stopped paying for the shared utilities (gas was turned off... no heat and no hot water) and they went into foreclosure. The same month, my husband went into work one day and the company that they were leasing the plant's coffee machine from had repossessed it due to missed payments. His paychecks started arriving late. He was eventually transferred to their other plant and was generally paid on time. We showered at the gym for weeks and moved out of that rental as soon as our lease was up and into a big apartment building. We never got our security deposit back. \n\nMy job ended in early 2011 as the Recovery Act funds dried out and I took a temp job and finally started a permanent job in early 2012. I was underemployed for almost 4 years. We managed to buy a house and by dumb luck bought at the very bottom of the market. We made about $50K when we sold 5 years later.\n\nIn short, it took my husband and I about 4 years to fully get back on track after the 2008 recession... and we had college degrees (I had a Master's Degree), we didn't have mortgage at the time of the crash, and we got lucky and bought at the bottom of the market. \n\nTLDR: As a couple we experienced 2 lost jobs, 4 years of under-employment, late paychecks, a landlord in foreclosure, a repo-ed coffee machine, a lost security deposit, and weeks of no hot water due to the 2008 recession.",

No one had any advice for us except \"when I was your age I had a house a car and a baby!\"\n\nThose who went to university got shit on for getting a 'useless degree.' Those who went to trades school were often stuck in low paying apprenticeship jobs because the aging journeymen could no longer retire and free up the jobs.  I was once fully in line and ready for a promotion and then on Monday, they'd rehired a guy who retired three years previously instead. He was 68 years old. \n\nThe price of used beater cars basically doubled. So there went the once achievable dream and goal of having our own ride, too. Ever wonder why Uber and ride sharing took off? That's a huge reason why. \n\nAll of a sudden our parents were freaking out too. A lot of us saw our college funds go towards the Family Business instead, or daddy's outstanding loans. A ton of divorce happened. \n\nSo basically, for a millennial in 2008, we'd gone from a lifetime of everyone telling us \"go to college, work hard, and the world will be your oyster.

Whenever I think of the recession it reminds me of the Jim Carrey movie Fun With Dick and Jane, which was a few years prior, but the job hunting scenes and how quickly they lost everything seemed spot on with reality.",

I knew several people that couldn't find work for 12-18 months after being laid off on top of loosing their retirement savings and homes in the crash. At this time a good chunk of the middle/younger millennials were just graduating and starting careers of their own only to immediately loose their jobs and prospects. If you didn't lose your job, your wages stagnated and you could kiss your raises and bonuses goodbye. And not just in the short term, but for years following. All negotiating power is lost when millions would happily take your job for less. This is particularly terrible if you're just starting your career. Not only are you more prone to layoffs, but wages took about a decade to \"catch up\" following the 2008 recession and in many industries they still haven't recovered. Starting wages in most fields today are the same as they were in 2008. And in industries where starting pay has gone up, it's still generally worth less than the starting wages in 2007 when you adjust for inflation. \n\nThis in part is why boomers cannot grasp the millennial/gen z struggle where we are making significantly less than they did when you adjust for inflation. This on top of being generally higher skilled, educated and productive leads to a lot of resentment towards boomers who are too prideful to admit they had a way better economy and time compared to their children and grandchildren.",

I was making maybe $7/hr working at various retail stores in the mall. At the time, I had a lot of friends in the Navy and I was advised to enlist because of the sign on bonus and wanted to join the Seabees (Naval Construction Force) so I could take that experience to go work for my step dad's contracting company after my deployment. We were eating canned foods and rice and cheap beer most days, when I got paid I'd get me and the boys a big chuck steak and we'd split it up, those were some special nights in their own way, (god bless my roommates Xbox 360). I had to take two different bus routes to get to work to my minimum wage job, if my pass ever expired and I couldn't afford it I'd have to charm my way onto the bus or my ass was walkin. If we couldn't afford groceries I am ashamed to say at times we would steal. I knew people that would dine and dash but I couldn't stomach that guilt. I didn't see a way out of that poverty for myself, so I went to a recruitment office, scored well on my ASVAB test, and was told by the Naval office my deployment to basic wouldn't be for up to a year due to how many people were signing up at the time because of the recession. I was stunned that during a war I'd have to wait so long to deploy as a volunteer, but that's how many people took the military as an option at the time because of how bad the market was.   \n  \nI just remember there was a lot of solidarity with the overall desperation and abject poverty most of my peers were facing at the time, but I do think that initial foray into adulthood really shattered the illusion that this was still a country where the American dream and hard work would get you out of the lower class. While as a millennial of course I have experienced much, but I feel deeply for the generation behind me, especially because COVID took away the most social aspects of their education away. We were a military family, and my boomer parents always tried to foster a sense of resilience and discipline in me that I am now very thankful for, but I do not share their same love and optimism for this country because we are aware of the sobering realization that we will likely never get those same opportunities our predecessors did. The economy eventually recovered, I am doing alright now. I got into IT and found a niche and am making four times the salary my parents did at my age and still can't afford a home, or a family, so I guess the term \"recovered\" is subjective. Tough times are likely ahead, and it will cultivate tough people, I would just encourage not letting that resilience harden your heart to the plights of your neighbor.

            "body": "I watched my parents lose the one thing they wanted their whole lives.\n\nI was in high school. Years before I was born, my parents bought a 10 acre lot for pennies outside of the city. They saved for DECADES to be able to afford to build their dream house on the land. It was kind of exciting goal for the whole family when I was growing up. Mom and dad would always be on the look out for things they liked, and styles they wanted in their dream home. I remember in 2004 when they finally hired the architect and had him over to look at their *literal* scrapbook of ideas torn out of magazines and old 4x6 photos they took of thinks they saw. The day the architect dropped off the full plans in 2006 was amazing. We had the giant plans laid out the table, and spent at least a week eating on the coffee table so we could leave the plans out. We kept flipping back and forth to see the floor plan, the \u201cconcept\u201d of the exterior, the attached dotted lines outlining how water sewage and electrical would be buried on the property. \n\nWhen the recession hit, *all* of their money was tied up in varying investments and accounts. They were on schedule to build early 2009. The architectures plans were pending approval by the city, and it all looked good to go\u2026 They lost about a third of their investments in a matter of weeks. Even more concerning, their retirement accounts dropped by half. I remember when they sat us down and told us, in tears, we\u2019d be staying in our current house. The dream they\u2019d been saving for vanished in a manner of weeks. \n\nThey held onto the land, still hoping they could maybe build something there someday. But, I think the realities of approaching retirement sunk in, and they sold it to a developer in the mid 2010s. They didn\u2019t tell us until after it was done. My parents never drive down that road. They\u2019ll take a 10 mile detour not to even see the lot. I drove by the lot a few years ago and it\u2019s now a condo development. I\u2019m sure there is some great parable about how the only individuals who benefited from the recession were the wealthy, but I can still only think back to my mom crying as she rolled up the architectural plans of her dream home for the last time.",

Our home value plummeted and we stopped our mortgage payments like many people at the time to get the foreclosure process started.  We had bought our home the previous year and we were willing to walk away from what we had put into it to get away from the mortgage that was for a home that had lost over half its value overnight.  I had just graduated with a bachelor\u2019s in nursing and all of the area hospitals were on a hiring freeze. After a lot of persistence, one of the area hospitals made an exception for me to get a preceptorship there and ultimately hired me. I was the last nurse hired for the next 2 years.  Many of my graduating class left California for places like Texas as they were still hiring, but for a fraction of the pay.  My husband used his time after his layoff and after I got my job to pivot his career. The silver lining is that he has his incredible and niche career today because of the changes that we were forced to make. Anyway, we did ok in the end and rented for a while and saved until we were able to get into the market again. Our foreclosure eventually fell off our credit. Everyone we knew foreclosed, the entire time period was crazy looking back now. \n\nWe are now 41 and have much more at stake this time. We couldn\u2019t walk away so easily from our home or careers now. The stakes will be much higher for us this time. Best of luck to everyone.",

Many people just skipped going to the doctor/dentist and relied on self-care or had to pay out of pocket. Many families had to move into tiny apartments or their grandparent's homes.

I wasn't financially great then, still would be in the same boat but now I am a bit better. I took $300 and invested it in 4 stocks almost precisely at the low point and came out with about $2,300. While I do not wish pain on anyone, I welcome a recession. This time I have a few more $ floating around and if it is similar to 2008, that means I can retire early and live comfortably off the interest. This time I have a decent but not great amount in my 401k, and about 3 weeks ago I did a redistribution action and placed (moved) all the funds into essentially a 1.5% savings account. This action has saved me quite a few thousand dollars alone in the recent market losses. Second is... I am doing my best to NOT participate in the economy right now, in an effort to save $ for the potential recession. Multiple reasons for that, but aside from being able to pay bills in a situation where I lose my job, the cash build is so that I can invest when its rock bottom. I will also put my 401k back into investments when it is rock bottom. Those 2 things combined (assuming a recovery!) should get me to a point of being able to retire early.\n\nWhat its like is thinking critically about your financial situation and how you can avoid travesty.

A week before my end-date they admitted they wouldn't give me a new one. \nA week later I heard my mother had breast cancer. She eventually died after 6 years of fighting. A month later my dad found out he had prostate cancer. \nBasically I was I was unemployed, broke, depressed and disappointed in myself for losing the job. My parents needed care too so I moved back in with them. In the day I cared for them, at night I picked up my old job in the container port. This went on for about a year and I basically spiralled into a bad weed habit, a lot of drinking and a worse depression. \nOne night I was getting drunk with my old neighbour. He works as a software developer for a very prestigious company. They were looking for testing engineers with experience in automotive. Why don't you give it a shot? I never thought I'd even have a chance, but heck, why not. To get social security here it's mandatory to write a letter every three days. Eventually I was interviewed three times, passed the IQ test and the skills test and they hired me!! I couldn't believe it.\nThree weeks later I was in a plane to get a month long training at Ohio University. I could until then only dream of making such a trip. My first ever flight was across the Atlantic. But the whole journey I was freaking out as I had only 23 euro in the pocket of my borrowed suit (the first paycheck came after two weeks), but I went ahead anyway. In one weekend I hitchhiked my way to Indianapolis, couchsurfed and saw the 500. A dream come true. All the others got a rental and a fancy hotel to some crappy tourist place.\n\nIt's 2025 now and I am still with the same company managing large automotive projects and a team of engineers.\n\nThe crisis did cost me, relatively. As I was laid off I couldn't profit from cheap houses for sale at that time. All my peers got a cheap place and sold it five years later for at least double. Thus by now have big villas, a Mercedes etc. We eventually got our first house ten years later (house prices here quintupled over this decade). But I dont complain, we have our own place and it may be tiny but it's ours. My parents always rented as they couldn't afford to buy anything. I am so grateful to be the first in my family to buy a house, to study, to go to another continent.",

Some people lost their houses but it seemed to be concentrated to specific areas. Most of the actual losses seemed to be limited to finance and real estate, so the working class mostly felt it via there being fewer jobs and more layoffs. The Middle class felt it via banks being far less willing to lend them money.\nSo basically everyone tightened their belts and accepted a lower standard of living for a few years. You took what jobs you could get. This is where recently graduated Millenials got screwed, because they came out of college with really expensive student loans and were forced to take the same minimum wage jobs they'd had before they got an education. But they could kick that debt can down the road and live within their means. It sucked, but by and large there wasn't mass homelessness or people starving. Never mind whatever the official definition of the difference between a recession and a depression is, That's the main one.\n\nSocio-politically\n\nBasically everyone agreed that the finance industry had caused this mess, and honestly I think this was the high point of class conciousness in my lifetime. The whole situation underlined how the finance industry existed as a parasitic class on top of the real economy, and could fuck up and erase a sizable percentage of our nation's buying capacity seemingly arbitrarily. Also, it became more obvious that money is more or less made up, because all the same products were capable of being produced by all the same machines with all the same workers, and the only thing holding up keeping everything running just like before was that on a computer somewhere a number was too small.  It's no coincidence that Cryptocurrency was invented around this time. \n\nAlso, for basically anyone who wasn't a Tea Party republican, we were riding high on having Elected Obama. He really was \"Change you could believe in.\" Even people not particularly excited about him specifically were happy to just be out from under Bush. So the whole economic pessimism was tempered by a socio-political optimism that we were moving in the right direction, and the underlying issues that had caused the recession were going to be identified and fixed by a competent government. \n\nThe failure of the government to actually, you know, *DO THAT*, is why the following decade was one of increasing radicalization.",

Even people with no debt and robust savings are gonna be in for a bad time. \n\nPolitically, a lot of the social safety nets that got people through 2008 have been or are in the process of, being removed. \n\nAdditionally, we have exactly the opposite of the cultural optimism we had back in 2008. Basically everyone except hardcore MAGA fanatics believe we're heading in the wrong direction. And many of us feel *very* fatalistic about that. So the sort of plucky, can do attitude and faith in a better future which gets people through hard times... isn't there.  And even for the true believers the consistent failure of their preferred policies to deliver the world they want to live in (sorry y'all, reality has a well known liberal bias) is means that they're gonna be stuck in constant cognitive dissonance rather than feeling satisfied. \n\nBasically, I'm willing to bet that the current economic situation is gonna make folk in the future completely forget the 2008 recession, except as context for what's coming now.",

But during week 3 murmurs were going around about a shakey economy and we all weren\u2019t so sure we would graduate to jobs at a dealership and not all of us would get a spot anymore. I was bounced around doing busy work and no chance to make real money or get a crack at a customer. I finally landed at Toyota where it was more of the same where they kept me in a corner looking for ways to get rid of me. I passed the initial drug test but they kept sending me for additional testing. I smoke weed and I didn\u2019t fail any tests but inconclusive results was what they harped on. Spent about 2 weeks there no sales and they still didn\u2019t even let me try. I was told you\u2019re too new keep studying? I did however shadow a more experienced salesman where I witnessed plenty of shady tactics and him outright tricking people into signing contracts customers were not really so keen on signing. The feeling around the dealership was panic as sales crawled to a snails pace and many big name brands stopped doing leases altogether. Every 2 weeks someone got fired and on week 4 I was the 1 everyone voted out. I tried to collect my check for training and the 2 cars I helped sell indirectly to no avail. My sis got a truck, a Lexus, and her friend bought something too. You\u2019re supposed to get 250 per referral and I never saw that money. Instead they tried to blame my people for doing shady things with cash when that was def not the case. Let me tell you some of those salespeople are the scum of the earth and will fk their own grandma over for an extra 500 bucks. Anyways I was in my early twenties and when I told my family that they were trying to withhold what was promised to me they got involved also. My sales teacher was one of the big wigs of this particular group was my contact on all this. He sent me for 1 more drug test hoping I\u2019d fail so he didn\u2019t have to pay me but I didn\u2019t and he reluctantly paid me in a check half of what I was owed to just go away. Of course I had to drive out to bumbfuck again to get it. I did learn a lot about the industry but a lot more about life and how even people who promise you the world will end up screwing you over when the economy gets tight! All of us trainees got conned into thinking we\u2019d make big money doing a fun job, but a good salesman has that effect on you. What we got was jerked around and our lives and money wasted by 1 charismatic old man. He  just liked to talk and act like a big shot to a room of money hungry rookies. He was more interested in his ego getting stroked rather than employing people. So If I learned 1 thing it\u2019s nobodys  safe in a bad economy and if you\u2019re the last 1 in you\u2019re the first one out! If you can work for yourself and hold all the cards or you\u2019ll always be subject to office politics or a boss putting you in the crosshairs to save his own financials.",

Two days earlier our company CEO told us that whoever was still on payroll essentially wasn\u2019t going to lose their job, but then two days later more people were laid off including myself. I immediately lost healthcare and was not given severance.\n\nI had been really bored in my position and was initially excited to be on the job hunt \u2026 but there were no more jobs. Marketing departments were the first to be slashed and I applied for hundreds of jobs but did not get hired, despite being a finalist for a few. I finally gave up my corporate job hunt after attending a networking event. I received a rejection letter from a job I didn\u2019t even apply to; it was comical and by that point it was over a year later, and I decided the universe wanted me to pivot career paths. \n\nIn July 2010, now not only heartbroken but long-term unemployed, in massive credit card debt and having my electricity shut off twice, I accepted an offer to be a retail manager. It was the hardest job I\u2019ve ever had, and I lasted ten months and lost 30lbs. I was ultimately let go for having the flu. \n\nBut by that point I had created a side hustle of modeling and working promos (tradeshow, liquor etc) and so I created a full time nearly decade-long  \u201ccareer\u201d upon leaving with this side hustle. I left this career in March 2020 with Covid since events of course were all cancelled, to sell vintage clothing full time. I\u2019ve been officially selling vintage for a decade (my multiple hustles included this) and have been self employed longer than I had a corporate career. \n\nI still have PTSD from the 15 months I was effectively on unemployment and the emotional and extreme financial challenges that came from losing a job with virtually no safety net. It\u2019s been the biggest learning lesson of my life, and I have never once repeated those same mistakes. I do not have credit cards, rebuilt my credit, and if I can\u2019t buy it with cash - I don\u2019t get to have it. \n\nIt\u2019s been a harrowing journey, but I\u2019m finally in a more comfortable and secure place. I don\u2019t know how I had the stamina at times to work literally 30 days in a row, many days 12-15 hrs.

We were all smoking weed and pigging out a couple times a month so we learned pretty quick that mcdonalds was the place to go.

The Cold War had us always thinking we'd die pretty soon. Waiting in line with our parents for gas. Being a kid the recession in the late 70's and watching the Iranian hostage crisis on the news at night. But still childhood was fun just running around til dark in the neighborhood. Our parents shielded us from their worries. We graduated high school and life felt good for a couple years until the gulf wars started, the works trade center was hit the first time, and nuclear war talk started again. When I hit 30, married with a couple kids and pregnant with my 3rd & 9/11 happened. Had just bought our first house. Fear ruled our brains but we kept it from our kids. Couponed like crazy. Signed up to \"glean\" for groceries (look that up if it's still a thing and you're struggling) Had one kid. 2008 housing crisis/recession hit and we lost our house in 2013...moved to a different state to start over and rented. My youngest two graduated during Covid. We were lucky though, spouse kept his job. Bought property back in our home state and moved back to build our first home since losing our first. Right when we were to sign docs on loan to start building, interest rates shot up to 7-8% and it was out of reach. Still own the property, and the credit card bills we had racked up in prepping the land, plans, permits, etc that would have rolled into the building loan. We are renting still, kids are all adults and we'd hope to be retiring in 10 years at 65ish but that's outta the question probably. I imagine we'll work full time til we're 70-75~our 401k has taken a huge hit and I imagine it'll be 10-15 years at least until our property is worth enough to sell for retirement funds. Our parents are all alive (80-85) and we are trying to help take care of them, while my in laws talk of how they were \"able to retire at 57 & 60 and why can't you?\", while helping our young adult kids manage their first adult recession. We always were told we'd be the sandwich generation and I finally feel what that means. We are lucky to still have good paying jobs, so with all this, we are still luckier than most. I'm happy now that mental health is talked about and thank the stars Zanax and Zoloft became a thing.",

Parents lost everything- our house that we'd lived in for barely 4 years, both my parents cars. Gas was like $8/gallon over the summer (Northern CA), my parents were separating that year too, so my mom was essentially a single mom all of a sudden. I don't know how she did it-i may have my issues with my mom, but i will always be in awe about how she managed bankruptcy and a divorce after 20 years of marriage, trying to put a freshly graduated high schooler through her first year of college, while my younger sister was still in high school. We went from a stable living environment to house jumping every year. With a bankruptcy on her credit, it was almost impossible to find rental houses that were in safe areas that accepted her one income and credit history. Rent would increase and we couldn't afford it anymore, so we had to move all over again. 2008-2010 was HARD financially. SO hard. That trauma is what made me wait so long to buy my 1st house until last year, and now I'm afraid we'll be back in the same position. Husband is on disability for the last few years and is finally at a place to go back to work- 2 months, 25+ applications, and not even an interview. I just got laid off in February and thank goodness for a severance check and with my experience, I was able to land another job fairly quickly, but it's at a much lower pay than I was at the last few years. To say I am terrified is an understatement. Ok...trauma dump over.",

It had the feel of a nascent depression, though thankfully we avoided that.\n\nWe also had 60 democratic senators and a democratic president who were able to lead us out of the recession despite furious republican opposition.\n\nWhat made it so scary was that it felt like the world had fundamentally changed, that the world we thought we lived in was gone forever.  In that case, it was due to a banking crisis--we realized that wall street had utterly deluded itself about the risks that housing prices could decline, and that the whole house of cards was falling down.\n\nThere was also a widespread bipartisan consensus that Wall Street was getting a \"free\" bailout.  This, combined with the Iraq War fallout, left people angry and distraught, which helps explain the rise of the tea party and MAGA.\n\nIf we do have another recession / depression, I anticipate an even greater sense of fear, hopelessness and despair, because once  again it will feel like \"this time is different.\". Not because of a banking crisis (dodd frank really did shore up the banking sector), but because of a widespread fear that:\n\nA) the government is intent on a tariff-driven trade war more  intense than the Smoot Hawley regime which intensified the Great Depression.\n\nB) the government will eviscerate the safety net (opposite of 2009)\n\nC) the government will not face any blowback, due to the dissolution of the Republic and installation of a totalitarian monarchy for the first time ever (probably less restrained than George III)\n\nD) AI will replace human labor to the point where the rich and powerful \"need\" the common man even less than they did in the days of feudalism and slavery.\n\nE) Dissent may be criminalized and severely punished, similar to what is seen in our government\u2019s only true ally (totalitarian Russia)",

Our recession didn't start until 2 years later, when we were finally pressed for real audit of the banks' assets. It was a deeper recession, so it took a lot longer to get out. My company had been feeling it for a while so they were sending us on international assignments to keep the department afloat. The US by 2009-2010 seemed it was full steam ahead with BUZNIS so at some assignment I was offered to stay and never looked back. In a way, I was able to dodge that financial crisis.\n\nMoral of the story is \"don't let yourself get attached to anything you won't be able to walk out in 30 seconds when you feel the heat around the corner\". Easier said than done now that I have 3 kids, but I have strong arms and a wife who is all in on making things work so if we have to move back to Europe to make things work, we will.

When the real estate crash happened I bought a few properties for cheap, rented them out, and sold them during Covid for big gains. I retired at age 41 in 2015 and do whatever I want now.\n\nI think a mistake a lot of people make is they tend to extrapolate whatever the current situation is into the far future. If the economy is good and they\u2019re making good money they spend everything and go into debt, thinking the good times will last forever. If the economy is bad they don\u2019t buy cheap assets because in their view the world is ending and will never be the same again. To be successful you must live below your means so you can save and have resources when opportunities arise. You must also act on those opportunities, even when your friends think it\u2019s crazy (or get like minded friends). You must also be lucky. You might say I got lucky because of my age, timing, etc but then why isn\u2019t every 51 year old also rich? Luck plus action equals success. You need both. So do the part that you can control and have a great life regardless of your net worth.
