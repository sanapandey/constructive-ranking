They\u2019ve collected all kinds of interesting tidbits there over the years, including downloads of the songs if you want them.\n\nEdited to add: and yes it makes me angry too! Especially considering, if you look through all the info the lead showrunner provided to fans over the years, it\u2019s obvious he was actually super passionate about the story. Sucks he didn\u2019t get to complete his vision. And a show like this can\u2019t really be recreated because the way it was done perfectly took advantage of the the fact that the internet era was really just taking off, and it incorporated the newness of all the technology really heavily into the show.",

He and Lisa are visited by an Arctic mouse, who is carrying a message from their old friend Casper who explains that he does not want to go alone. On the way, David and Lisa meet up with all the animals, who have come to say goodbye. Then they travel to the Blue Mountains and have tea with Casper. Past the Blue Mountains is a beautiful valley of flowers. They tell Swift he cannot climb up the mountain with them. The Gnomes ascend the mountain, and say final goodbyes. As David and Lisa pass on, their bodies turn into intertwined apple trees. Casper passes moments later, after muttering to himself for awhile, and turns into an oak tree. On the way back to the forest, Swift meets another gnome named Christopher, who rides a female fox named Agnes. Swift and Agnes appear to be romantically interested in each other. Christopher and the spirits of the dead Gnomes wave goodbye!<",

They released only the first 2 seasons on DVD and so even the high seas wasn't of any help in tracking down seasons 3 and 4. It took me over a decade to track it down and a few years back found all 4 seasons uploaded by someone on YouTube. I still go back to it watching an episode or 2 when I miss my childhood days.",

I remember once sitting in the emergency waiting room at the hospital because I sliced my hand open (needed stitches) accidentally, and my dad was sitting with me waiting to be seen. They had two TVs in the waiting area, one for kids and one for adults. I guess whatever was on that night wasn't interesting because he said for us to move to the other side, which wasn't typical. He sat and watched with me, the only time we ever watched cartoons together. It was nice. We did other things together and watched other things together but that is what I think about when I remember chalk zone.",

It was ... very rough and much less good as I remembered it being. The first half of S1 was very rough, but had some good ideas. S2 was awesome. S3 and S4 moved to action and gimmick episodes, as opposed to actually exploring ideas of what parallel worlds could look like. S5 was just nuts since they got rid of the Mallory boys entirely and only Rembrandt was still there from the beginning. And then, it just ... ended. No resolution for anyone except for Arturo, who was killed early in the show (or, was he? Did he really slide in the world with his evil duplicate? Or was that the duplicate and he's still living on that world?), and Wade, who had a horrific ending and life due to the Kromaags.",

Animation and writing is top notch, the premise is fresh and interesting. Goes down as one of my favorite cartoon segments of all time. But then the animation drops in quality for a few episodes and the writing gets weak. But then we get an episode with a massive jump in production quality again, and writing like the gun violence episode or Hudson befriending the blind man. But then is spirals into inanity again for 5+ episodes until the next time the quality jumps up again. This is all first season. Don't get me started on whatever the hell the 2nd season fever dream was. \"I know, let's leave the premises and characters behind and travel through time in the mists of Avalon for ....37? episodes?",

The rumor is that they got several thousand copies made and packaged up, only to have the release canceled at the last minute.  So they might be out there, rotting in a giant warehouse somewhere.  \n\nI'm not sure why they don't have it on Paramount plus.  It seems like that would be a no-brainer.  The music rights could be holding it up, I guess, as they used licensed stuff (though from indie artists like Magnetic Fields and Apples in Stereo, so that probably wouldn't up the cost too much).  Sucks to have one of the best kids' shows of all time end up officially unavailable outside of used DVD's.",

So I'm going to go down the list of what I think are obscure shows, and then maybe one of them will turn out to be so obscure to qualify for the Reddit post.\n\n- Dragon Tales \n\n- Jane and the Dragon \n\n- 3 2 1 penguins \n\n- Batar (I think, could be a false memory on this one)\n\n- Jay Jay the Jet Plane \n\n- The Zula Patrol \n\nI kind of want to put some PBS shows here as well, but I'm really unsure if those ones are considered obscure. I'll make an edit if it turns out there's some PBS shows people don't know about. Besides the one I already put on here of course. I might add a edit for a more comprehensive list of PBS shows I thought were obscure that I watched as a kid.\n\nUpdate: Dragon Tales is definitely popular. Most people commented that they do about dragon tales. However, I think my strategy worked as even though some of these shows were popular, nobody commented yet that they actually watched 3-2-1 penguins. Somebody mentioned that I got the name wrong. But haven't said that they actually watched it. so maybe I found one. Same with Batar.\n\nAs promised I'm going to try adding some PBS shows, but these might be much more popular than I originally suspected. I think Dragon Tales was actually a good tell for me being able to find obscure shows on PBS. \n\n- Peg + cat\n\n- Postcards from buster (You may have heard of arthur though. This was a spin-off series of arthur)\n\n- Pocoyo (Maybe, could just be remembering a creepypasta based off of said show)\n\n- The Electric Company \n\n- Peep and the big wide world \n\n- Super Why (Definitely watch this as a kid but unsure how obscured it is. I thought this one was a meme for a while, but it really depends on how far that meme spread)\n\nUpdate 2: Never mind, someone said an hour ago that they seen 3 2 1 penguins. Batar is still in the running though.\n\nUpdate 3: Someone has officially said that they have watched Babar. In fact, they corrected my spelling of it.",

                    "body": "Fun fact for any Resident Evil fans or anyone else who cares- in the show, the main character Loonette the little clown girl from the Big Comfy Couch is played by Alyson Court, who is also the OG voice actress for Claire Redfield from the 1998 Resident Evil 2 game, and again in Resident Evil: Code Veronica. as well as two animated movies Resident Evil: Degeneration and Resident Evil: Damnation. Additionally, she also provides the voice for Lydia Deetz in the animated 1989 Beetlejuice series.\n\nI've been a huge RE fan since I was a kid and Claire was always my favorite character, but moreso for the RE projects where she was specifically played by Alyson cuz out of all the other voice actors in the game, she always stuck out to me as the most realistic sounding character vs the typical voice acting most people expect when you think of how your average cringey 90's video game character sounded back then. I was just randomly looking up her IMDB history one day out of curiosity and I saw her roles for Beetlejuice and the Big Comfy Couch and it blew my fucking mind that that was all the same person. I remember I immediately went and brought up a random video on YouTube from the Big Comfy Couch just to see and hear her speak as Loonette back then on the show, and it was so weird because I was like yup I can absolutely hear Claire Redfield in her voice when she talks.\n\nAnyway, dumb fun fact but it made me happy so I hope another fan sees it and is subsequently mind blown. :)\n\nEdit: changed Jill Valentine to Claire Redfield because I'm a fucking idiot",

I've actually been doing that out loud recently too and my boyfriend and has to correct me. I think I have Jill stuck in my mental cuz we just did another playthrough of the remake of RE3 recently, plus I've been trying to get my hands on the GameCube version of the OG Resident Evil 3: Nemesis for awhile now. Cuz for me, with the remakes I feel like the perpetual presence with Mr. X in 2 and Nemesis in 3 sort of ruins the atmosphere in a way because of how they're literally ALWAYS on your ass. Like I miss the way they played with your nerves more in the originals because you weren't constantly forced into these unrelenting confrontations at every turn, ESPECIALLY with Nemesis in the remake. Cuz the more infrequent and unexpected the run ins were the more tense and on edge you felt because you never really knew when it was coming. I still remember actually screaming \"WHAT THE FUCK\" when I first realized the police station was no longer a safe zone they couldn't reach you in \ud83d\ude02. \n\nIn OG Nemesis I used to love moments when you were in the middle of doing something and you'd hear glass breaking somewhere, the normal background music/sound would fade out and go silent before you'd hear that tense music for a couple seconds cuz it meant Nemesis was reeeally close by..and next thing you know you hear his terrifying theme and him tearing ass towards you from somewhere, but you didn't always know exactly where from. Unlike the remake where his presence is almost non-stop and you can almost always tell where he's coming from because of his heavy ass footfalls always stalking through the halls so it takes that tense element out of it. Maybe it's just the nostalgia of how scary and awesome I remember it as a kid, cuz I admit i'm not AS big a fan of the remakes though they're undeniably cool. I'll always love the original Nemesis ending more, and I'll forever insist that Code Veronica is the best of em all, originals and remakes. :)",

I was hooked.  The finale sent me because I absolutely -had- to watch it and I think they only aired it once.  Seeing Sadie and Derek finding a semblance of success on...I don't remember if it was Disney or Nickelodeon made me so happy.  I was over the moon when I found Noah Reid released albums some years back and finally saw him when he toured last year.  When he asked for requests,  I really wanted to have him sing \"Reflections\" from the mirror episode,  but I didn't know if he'd even remember the reference. His music just feels like home to me though. So glad he's found happiness.",

There was a human host who I recall having a voice like Jason Lee. There was also a trio of dinosaur mascots, think Barney but with a touch of that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle \u2018tude.\n\nThe two teams would take turns selecting one of the dinosaurs to deliver a question. They\u2019d have some item that they found floating in the sewer that would loosely tie into the question and the answer was always numerical.\n\nWhy was this important? Because to answer the question, the players would have to toss the item back and forth between each other the appropriate amount of times before returning it to the dinosaur to submit their final answer. I think there may have been a time limit for added pressure.\n\nAny form of failure would result in the dinosaur spinning a wheel which would dictate what messy substance got dumped on the players.\n\nTeam with the most points after a few rounds of this would move on to the endgame. Now the dinosaurs were standing behind stools with buckets and the host would ask multiple choice questions. Players would pick the stool they thought represented the correct answer and the dinosaur would dramatically dump their bucket.\n\nCorrect answer? It was either empty or had something innocent like confetti. Wrong answer was, you guessed it, slime! Getting slimed would eliminate you and the goal was to get 4 questions correct before the entire team got slimed.\n\nTo this day, I\u2019ve yet to find a single clip online nor have I had anyone else say they remember it.",

I was a kid in the 80s and was hanging out in a friend\u2019s house and watching TV. Something happened to the regular schedule ( can\u2019t remember what) and the said this show was on instead of what we expected. Back then we didn\u2019t have many channels so you just watched whatever was on or nothing. The show was called something like \u201cSpain Spain Holiday\u201d . The production quality was so bad it was funny. Shaky camera work and presenters that had broken English. When it stopped for ad breaks the used the phase \u201c and now it\u2019s time for a break commercial\u201d which my friend and I quoted for years as an inside joke. All these years later I\u2019m questioning whether it was real, satire or a fever dream. The internet has no trace that it ever existed and I\u2019ve done google searches and asked on message boards. I guess it will just be one of life\u2019s unanswered questions.",

I don\u2019t remember whether being President was his secret identity and he would give the Secret Service the slip when his superpowers were called for. Or if he did the mundane tasks of bill-signing and receiving foreign dignitaries with a cape on.\n\nEdit: okay, it was not all a Cap\u2019n Crunch powered hallucination: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_President\n\n> The National Association of Broadcasters said: \u201cAn all-time low in bad taste, with the President of the United States in a Superman role. NBC was responsible for this direct ideological approach to totalitarianism. We fear that there may be other broadcasters who are irresponsible enough to keep it in circulation\u201d.\n\n> In The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows, David Perlmutter says that the show is \u201cperhaps the worst animated program in the late 1960s (its producers admitted it themselves)\u201d and calls the superhero president \u201carguably the most implausible superhero narrative idea ever invented\u201d.",

So finally they said, \"well maybe you're just waking up on the wrong side of the bed!\" So finally she got up and climbed off the other side of the bed and she was all happy and everybody cheered.

And tbf, it wasn\u2019t a surprise not much people heard of it. \n\nMy dad watched it when it debuted, and he said stuff like that you had to catch it when it played, otherwise you would miss out on it. I would watch it on DVD when it came out. But this show has been an underrated masterpiece for a long while. From only airing from 2003-2005 on Cartoon Network and never appearing since, to releasing two DVD volumes that were pretty hard to find, to 2008 Clone Wars overshadowing it, to later on being under Legends once Star Wars was sold to Disney, it was pretty hard to watch it officially for a very long time. Until in 2020, they released it on Disney+, upscaled with a few tiny changes. Now it\u2019s gained more traction nowadays, but at the time, this was truly something else. Has great action, gives lesser characters spotlight, makes way for new characters such as General Grievous, Asajj Ventress, Commander Cody, Durge (who would in the future assist with the creation of Cad Bane), and bridges between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith rather well. \n\nBut most people I know who are Star Wars fans have never heard of such a thing. I only overheard a classmate at school talk about and I told them about the show (though this was back in 2020, where the show debuted on Disney+), but man, it was an obscure piece of media that I\u2019m surprised not much people heard about. And for those who have not seen it yet, I highly recommend watching it, it\u2019s a must for any Star Wars fan!",

The red ants and the blue ants would sit on the opposite ends, their queens would sit in this big chairs.

Reviews were mixed and ratings doomed it to a mere 8 episodes, but for a kid like me who loved V, it scratched that sci-fi itch. \n\nPremise: the Sterling family is transported to an alternate reality after entering the Great Pyramid of Giza during a planetary conjunction. Young me enjoyed the wackiness of it, and now when I read about it, it sounded like a mix of typical sci-fi themes, 1984, and rebellion against organized religion.\n\nThe producer wanted a darker tone for the show, but CBS wanted something more family friendly. This is probably why the showed failed miserably, even though it had an interesting premise and lore wrote into it.",

It got lost in a tempest and they crashed in a land that was disconnected from our contemporary world. With more of a medieval ish era.

It was a TV movie that was meant to be a pilot for a show, but I guess it didn't do well enough so the show was never made.\n\nIt was called \"Island City\".  It was about how in the near future, they create an anti-aging drug that a majority of the people on earth use, but years later the drug was found to have side effects that de-evolved people into sort of neanderthal-like people, I think they were called Recessives because the drug interacted with a recessive gene or something.  Most of the world was destroyed, and the few survivors live in isolated fortress cities.  While it was a post-apocalyptic show, the city (at least the one we see in the pilot) isn't some run-down barbaric compound but a very well-run, safe, highly technological paradise of sorts.  People who took the drug had to have this crystal implanted in their chest.  The crystal reacts to the drug in the body and emit a colored light so that people know who they can reproduce with without giving birth to more Recessives.  Either you can only reproduce with people of the same color light, or the opposite, I forget.  I remember this being shown on TV at least twice and I enjoyed it both times.  Probably around 25 years ago.",

So idk\n\nAnother storyline was about a dancer girl who got picked to perform somewhat later minute in a Cliff Richard concert that her mom and aunt had tickets to. The camera crew filmed the mom and aunt gradually having it dawn on them that she was one of the dancers they were seeing on stage.\n\nAt least at one point the lead singer in the group may have gone on to cruise ship work.\n\nFor reasons I miss that show, I really liked it.

A major plot point in the series was about someone important in their world turning 16 and how some thought it wasn't possible. There was also a place called The Tower that was originally the home of the antagonists. Toward the end there were story lines in both the normal world and this alternate world, and the last thing I remember about it was the barrier between the adult world and the child world being destroyed.\n\nLike I said, my memory on all of this is hazy. I saw it almost 30 years ago. No one I've met and discussed it with in real life has ever heard of it (and there are big chunks of the middle of the show I never saw).

His younger brother, who was a borderline criminal joined him and they had a bromance buddy cop dynamic. They had a hot female boss and an arsenal of seized luxurious cars in their headquarters. It was set in a big city, I believe one with a warm climate.\n\nThe other one \u2013 there was a guy who was an android, programmed by an evil organization. There was a ton of mystery surrounding him, but he had joined an organization of good guys who were taking care of him. He was kind of clueless, but very good in the action tasks they were giving him, as they were trying to help him comprehend the world. Idk what his name is but it sounded like \"Ed Daniels\".\n\nIf someone can help me figure out the names of those shows, please tell me.\n\nOthers were \"Just Shoot Me\", \"Jesse\", \"Grace Under Fire\" and \"Veronica's Closet\". I know they were popular in some places, but nobody seemed to watch them where I lived even though they were on national TV.\n\nOof, I just spent some time trying to figure out the mysterious two series: Fastlane and Code Name: Eternity.",
