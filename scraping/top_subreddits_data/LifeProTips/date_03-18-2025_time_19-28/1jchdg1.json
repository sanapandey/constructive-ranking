    "selftext": "I\u00a0used to think my introverted personality made it hard to fit into society, whether at work or in social settings. Sometimes, I even pretended to be outgoing and tried to blend in. But over time, I realized how exhausting it was\u2014social interactions drained me completely. So, I decided to socialize on my own terms, without exaggerating myself or forcing connections.\n\nAs an introvert, I\u2019m sensitive to others\u2019 emotions, so I only speak up at the right moments. If someone asks for my opinion, I calmly think it through and confidently share my thoughts (in a normal tone and volume). At work, if I notice someone struggling, I\u2019ll quietly say, 'If you need help, I\u2019m here.'\n\nThe result? I\u2019ve built genuine connections with a few people who truly understand me, and they\u2019ve shown me kindness in return.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re an introvert like me but still want to make friends, just be yourself. Stay confident and authentic, and the right people will appreciate you for who you are. Plus, this approach naturally filters out those who aren\u2019t the right fit, leaving you with truly meaningful friendships.",

And they are 100% skills, skills which need to be learned and practiced. Some people learn it faster, or more intuitively than others, but everyone can and should learn to to read a room and calibrate their behavior appropriately.\n\nI used to hate public speaking, honestly I still mostly do, but I get over it and do the chore. I even like to consider myself decent at it. You won't ever see me on a list of the greatest speakers of all time, but that's fine. I don't need to hit that level, I just need to talk naturally for half an hour presenting at a conference without embarrassing myself. That's a bar anyone with a serious career should rise to meet.",

People have taken the term and tried to change its meaning to what you describe, but that doesn\u2019t make the original meaning wrong:\n\nHe holds aloof from external happenings, does not join in, has a distinct dislike of society as soon as he finds himself among too many people. In a large gathering he feels lonely and lost. The more crowded it is, the greater becomes his resistance. He is not in the least \u201cwith it,\u201d and has no love of enthusiastic get-togethers. He is not a good mixer. What he does, he does in his own way, barricading himself against influences from outside. He is apt to appear awkward, often seeming inhibited, and it frequently happens that, by a certain brusqueness of manner, or by his glum unapproachability, or some kind of malapropism, he causes unwitting offence to people...\nFor him self-communings are a pleasure. His own world is a safe harbor, a carefully tended and walled-in garden, closed to the public and hidden from prying eyes. His own company is the best. He feels at home in his world, where the only changes are made by himself. His best work is done with his own resources, on his own initiative, and in his own way...\nCrowds, majority views, public opinion, popular enthusiasm never convince him of anything, but mere make him creep still deeper into his shell.\nHis relations with other people become warm only when safety is guaranteed, and when he can lay aside his defensive distrust. All too often he cannot, and consequently the number of friends and acquaintances is very restricted.",

Either of us can and usually make friends in line ups, lobbies, on the street, etc. We're more social than our extroverted friends in fact. It's usually a joke amongst those who know us that we just interact with the nearest person and make friends in weird places\n\nI do think we're both hyper social and might be the exception here though. But I am introverted, and I do my time to myself. People know this about me and we both accept it. I embrace it, and others understand it. If I get a call to come hang out or go to a party and I say \"I'm all social'd out, I'm going to chill by myself for a bit\" they understand and don't push me because I won't have fun if I go, and I'll be moody, quiet, and seclusive.\n\nNot saying you have to be hyper social, but people should embrace what they do and work in those parameters. It's easier when you give yourself permission to be who you are. I'm going to spend this Sunday locked in my room playing Outer Worlds finally (awesome game btw). My friend group knows I'm out for any plans this weekend.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention, extroverts can be anti social and have social anxiety too. The amount of talks I have with my extroverted friends on \"Was I a little weird yesterday?\" And so on is a lot. In fact, it's disproportionate compared to my introverted friends, likely because they aren't comfortable talking about it as much though.",

So this is more to address others who may read this.\n\nI think there is often some confusion between introversion and being shy / awkward / self conscious. Introverts still very much need social connections and will suffer immensely if they don't get it.\n\nI used to believe I was just introverted, but when I went solo travelling for a while I learned very quickly that, while I was introverted, I can't live without socialisation. That ended up pushing me to start conversations with fellow travellers and making friends with a wide variety of different people. It also helped me be less socially awkward when I got home, which has strengthened my existing relationships too.\n\nWhile I believe you (op) have figured this out, I highly encourage any socially awkward introverts to go and put yourself in a situation where you can't fall back on those you know. Also it helps dramatically if you're in a place with like-minded people who you are likely never to see again. Hostels are a good example of this.\n\nOr idk, maybe I'm just talking out of my ass. All I can really say is that it helped me.",

I really needed that break and feel like it did wonders for my mental health. Thing is, I do have friends still but talking to them I realize time passes and we age and are busy with all our own problems, some have moved on or have entered serious relationships or careers, so even if I return that same company as we were is gone for good and save for 1 or 2 people we may meet once a month I'd have to start again. Back then I didn't really have to put much personal effort in finding people cause I was part of a pretty open group, the downside of that being of course that ties that bind were pretty loose and people came and went and basically very few remained long term. Now I actually have to go and meet new people myself which stresses me. I know that the format is simple, find an outdoor hobby or a place where people with the same interests as you gather and interact, you'll know if you click with someone, actually doing it though is another matter.",

            "body": "There's a lot of pseudoscience behind the concepts of introversion and extroversion. If, for example, you consider yourself purely one or the other, Carl Jung, the guy who came up with the concepts, would say you belong in an insane asylum. Human psychology is complicated, and (assuming his theory is even true), everyone falls on some spectrum between pure introversion and extroversion. I think there would be a lot more healthy discussion around the concepts if people were more aware of this. So prefacing anything with \"as an introvert...\" just comes off as misinformed. Unless you're using that as shorthand for \"as someone with more introverted than extroverted tendencies...\", I guess. Which I would consider myself to be, by the way. \n\nBut even so, we shouldn't assign introverts certain \"super powers\", like the idea that they're \"sensitive to others' emotions\". That's not an introversion-specific ability, that just comes from not being an asshole and actually listening to people. I'm not trying to shit on your life experiences and I'm glad that you have that trait, but literally anyone can learn how to do that. \n\nAlso, to some extent, you're right about not pretending to be someone you're not. But a lot of people's version of \"just being themselves\" involves never leaving the house. Or never speaking in public. They're not making any friends if they keep that up. I learned the hard way that \"just be yourself\" is bad advice in general. There are people who will take it too literally and just not work on themselves at all, ask me how I know. At some point I definitely had to try to be someone I'm not in order to get anywhere in life. You have to balance being genuine with also trying to push yourself out of your comfort zone.",

That's STILL you! The capacity for that is STILL inside of you. So don't pigeon-hole yourself as an introvert and nothing else.\n\nSecondly, most of us think that we need to be an extrovert to be likable, which is just not true at all. I've found that people who can selfishly enjoy themselves in an extroverted environment are creating a vibe for those around them that is also very likable, and since that's all you really have control over anyways, focus on that over anything else!",

You can bail if it's too much, but it's surprising how often those tiny interactions turn into something bigger. Once, I just asked someone where they got their coffee, and now we meet up for coffee regularly. \n\nAlso, think about activities that force a bit of interaction but aren't overwhelming. I've joined a book club where it's mostly silent reading, but we chat a bit before and after. It\u2019s low-pressure because hey, when all else fails, you just talk about what happens in the book. Certainly doesn't hurt my ability to make friends.\n\nThat's just what works for me, though, and it\u2019s not a one-size0fits-all. I can just ramble on about this forever, but not like that would be helpful. It's all a bit trial and error, yeah?...",

It's not easy for me, but I was tired of being their special exception they always had to sacrifice time for. I've been able to connect with them more because of it, and even meet new people, and although it helps, it's an ever going battle for me. They're more extroverted, and allowing them to drag me around, no matter how much I dread it, has opened a lot of new paths I'm happy to have.\n\nSo no, \"being yourself\" doesn't work all the time.

The truth is, 80% of what they say online they would never say to someone in person knowing that they would be judged or ignored. Nobody cares about what they say online, outside of the quick rise SJWs get from typing something that makes them feel morally righteous.
