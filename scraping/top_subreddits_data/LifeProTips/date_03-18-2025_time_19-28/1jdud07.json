    "selftext": "Nowadays, a lot of people feel pressured to have the same lifestyle and opportunities as their peers on social media or in their environment. The media have glamorized certain lifestyles, and some individuals have been led to believe that they should have many friends, date frequently in college, or own a big house by their 30s. Fear of missing out (FOMO) and societal expectations about what one should accomplish by a certain age can lead to anxiety and guilt. Additionally, we may not be prepared or ready to undertake certain tasks at that time. Many people who marry young have a higher chance of divorce. Regret is a natural part of life, even for those you perceive to have it all, if you get close to them.\n\nThe truth is that we all have different life experiences, and everyone will miss out on something. It\u2019s more important to focus on your individual goals at a pace that suits you than to rush. You can always revisit things you haven\u2019t experienced before, and sometimes those experiences can be even better. Life becomes easier when you focus on your own individual goals and experiences rather than trying to meet every milestone or invisible expectation. You should accept that you\u2019ll miss out on something and start building your own experiences in the present. Do what fits you personally, and stop trying to copy your peers or beating yourself up for not achieving milestones by a specific age. ",
