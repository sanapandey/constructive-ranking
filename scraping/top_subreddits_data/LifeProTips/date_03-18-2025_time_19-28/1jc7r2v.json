    "selftext": "If you have the room in your refrigerator, apples will keep fresh for months just sitting on a shelf or in a drawer.  I don't keep them in a bag, just set them in there.  Wash them off when you're ready to eat them.  Make sure to check them regularly, and remove any bad ones.  Buying in bulk is a good way to save money, and they will stay fresh for quite a while.\n\n",

My fridge is always stuffed with other things, and when I buy apples, I want them to be easy to grab, like right there on the counter. But living in a warm place, I've totally learned that they ripen faster, which I kinda like sometimes 'cause they get juicy. Also, when you leave them out for a bit, and they start to get soft, boom, perfect for pie or smoothies without feeling guilty for not eating them in time. I just never really got behind the idea of having apples in the fridge next to my eggs or milk. Plus, sniffing around at a farmer's market more often to pick what you need makes fruit shopping more fun! Or maybe sticking them in the fridge is just smart grown-up stuff and I\u2019m still living  in snack chaos, LOL.",
