It was also in a pretty deep valley with mountains all around, so even sat internet was spotty at best, and starlink wasn't around yet. It was great if I wanted to escape somewhere that no one would be able to reach me unless it was so much of an emergency someone would come and get me.

If they can connect it, great, it's already set up. If they can't, the Internet service can be quickly cancelled.",

IMO much better to pick the place you like and change your carrier.\n\nThere are also the MVNO reseller carriers that are starting to allow switching to any of the three major cell provider\u2019s networks.

Those rideshare app prices won't matter if you don't have service for your data.  So no, phone service is more important.",

Or there's going to be a storm that knocks out everything and now you can't even have a hotspot because you're coverage sucks.   Don't dismiss this LPT just because you have Wi-Fi calling sometimes. You know you don't even make that many calls.",
