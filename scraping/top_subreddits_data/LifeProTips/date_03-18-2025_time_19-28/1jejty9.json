    "selftext": "I recently discovered a life hack I though I\u2019d share. I served a large bowl of punch at a gathering with vodka, mint leaves, pomegranate and other fanciness. I also used up all the ice in our ice maker to fill it.\n\nAfter the party, I was about to toss the alcoholic, fruity, melted dregs at the bottom of the bowl. It seemed wasteful, so I poured it into a square container and froze it. And now I have a giant ice block ready for the next time I make punch!  ",
