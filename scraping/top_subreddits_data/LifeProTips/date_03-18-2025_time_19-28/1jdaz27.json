If a person is not doing the most basic things to be happy to eat right, exercise, go to sleep at a reasonable time, when they complain of being unhappy and tired compassion rewards that behavior. If they are doing all of the things everyone needs to do to be happy and facing issues, sure compassion is the appropriate response. But when the person won't do these things and complains compassion may be a disservice in rewarding their behavior. That reinforces that they may stick with it rather than adapt. Psychology literature discusses that cessation of behavior is linked to starving that behavior of positive reward. Kind is not always nice.\n\nApplying this filter, when a persons health deteriorates such that strangers cannot tell whether pregnant or unhealthy compassion for offending them does harm. Reinforces destructive behaviors that ends unhappily for all around that individual and their personal state of happiness. Our food supply is terrible. Our education is terrible. And yet we never have had better information on how to adjust diet to be both satisfied and healthy (at the same time as more distracting entertainment). In 2025 this is a lifestyle choice. Choosing not to do the basic things anyone needs to be happy. Don't need to tip-toe around that. It's not kind, it's a small cruelty to tip-toe around the topic.",

You don\u2019t need to qualify any relationship, just address everyone as people. \n\n\n\nStory time. \n\nWhen my first son was very young he had to have a surgery. This was during Covid, so when we were in hospital we had to be masked up 100% of the time.  So the doctor and anesthesiologist come out to talk to my wife and I. I was a little busy keeping my kid entertained, so the doctors started asking the questions and explaining the process to her and what we were to do while they had him in surgery.  \n\nFinally the time comes for them to take him in, and the doctor, whom I still hadn\u2019t really talked to says, \u201cok mom, you and grandma can go wait in the cafeteria, and you will get a text when he\u2019s ready.\u201d Now, it took me a second to realize what they said, but my wife caught it right away and was like \u201c Grandma? That would be dad actually.\u201d This doctors body language completely changed, she physically slumped, and started stammering apologies while we burst out laughing.  It was definitely a rough moment for her. \n\nI did happen to have a long ponytail and a pink sweater on and with the mask I guess she couldn\u2019t see the moustache and stubble, but I was also  6\u2019 tall and 200 pound man of 30 at the time, so I feel like she probably could have made a better guess than grandma.",
