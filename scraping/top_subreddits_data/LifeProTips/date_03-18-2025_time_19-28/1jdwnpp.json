The people who had stayed there before me had connected it to their Amazon account and it synched to their account and I assume their phone? Where ever they were when I was there was a different time zone. \n\nI couldn't figure out how to reconnect it without signing into my own account, which I didn't want to do. It was part of the bedside lamp, so I couldn't just unplug it. I tried unplugging and plugging it back in hoping that would reset it - it did not. \n\nOh well.",
