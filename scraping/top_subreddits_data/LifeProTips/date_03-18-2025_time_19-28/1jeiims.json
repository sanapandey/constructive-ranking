You never know when you might get a flat tire or need to check underneath your car while out and about. It provides a perfect barrier between you and the dirty, rough ground. \n\nI also spread it in the back of my car when I need to transport wet, pool clothes home. No mildew or moisture smell in the car since the water didn\u2019t saturate the bottom of the trunk. \n\n$5 well spent! ",

I can see a towel covering more purposes, but a yoga mat, even a cheap one, will be thicker and may be more beneficial in some situations as a result.\n\nI think I\u2019m gonna take the towel advice sooner though as I most certainly have one of those to spare already. Been trying to figure out a good list of things to keep in my car since I only got my license a few months ago haha",
