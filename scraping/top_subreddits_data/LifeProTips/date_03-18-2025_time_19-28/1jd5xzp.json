    "selftext": "This is something that is very minor and might seem excessive but it could save your life. If you slip and fall the wrong way and hit your head, that can quite easily end up killing you if help didn\u2019t arrive.\n\nSo when you are going up into the attic, on a step ladder, or on and steps or ladder that aren\u2019t as supported or aren\u2019t regularly shaped, text someone and let them know. Make sure you wait for a response too and tell them to call you if you haven\u2019t texted them back in 5 minutes. Then just text them when you are back down.\n\nObviously, if you are gonna be up and down or on the ladder for a while, it is best to have someone home, but if that isn\u2019t accessible, this is still your best option. Have them check in on you every 30-1hr.\n\nThis may be common practice already for some people for all I know but it\u2019s what I have started doing now that I have my own place and I think it\u2019s a pretty quick and easy tip that has no downsides.\n\nEdit: I can understand people thinking it\u2019s a bit over cautious, but this is nothing like texting about taking a shower or something along those lines. Most people go on a ladder very infrequently and are a lot less used to doing it than they are at taking a shower. It takes 1 minute to text someone and it happens like once or twice a year\u2026\n\nA shower or stairs are something that while dangerous, we understand as an everyday necessity that would be absurd to plan our lives around. This is not the case with ladders for most people reading this I would think.\n\nGuess I should have posted this in unpopular opinions! I think I will tomorrow \ud83e\udd23",

Plus the frequency just takes away from the shower point more. Cause yeah, texting someone every day would be ridiculous. Texting someone 2-3 times a year for a span of 5 minutes, not so much.",

Next would be to be on a call with someone or any other method that can react without your input like a device with fall protection. Then making sure to have your phone on you (because it's easy and the inconvenience is minor). And only then this texting situation you suggest.\n\n\nThe person you text lives next door but that is not true for all of us so this texting suggestion is more of a have someone to find your dead body faster tip than to have help as fast as you can. It is wishy-washy on how dangerous even you feel about climbing ladders versus how common it is.\u00a0\n\n\nWhoever this LPT would be useful to should probably have someone over instead. Either wait until someone you live with is home. Ask a neighbour. Have a friend or family member come over. Or at least be on a call with someone. If something happens you want help immediately. Whatever is in the attic shouldn't be so urgent that it cannot wait. And if it is, it probably shouldn't be in the attic.\n\n\nLike if you want to text people before going into the attic so be it. But basically you are saying it is a task\u00a0safe to do alone but want extra reassurance. The backlash you are getting is people thinking \" if it safe enough to do alone why are we texting people and if it is not safe enough to do alone why don't we arrange better precautions?\"",

It is something that for most people, it is perfectly safe to do alone but it has a certain element of danger that needs to be considered. \n\nSo we go the precautions route, to which I would say none of the solutions you provided (apple watch or having your phone on you) are like clearly way easier than my alternative. They are all about the same level of planning. \n\nThe texting someone is not to have somebody find your dead body. Have you never had anyone tell you text me when you get home safe? If they didn\u2019t text that means that you could call 911 and get help to them much sooner than if that weren\u2019t the case. Is this not a well understood thing?\n\nThe reality is people live alone and need to get things from the attic or the shelf. They might not see it as such a risk that they need someone there, but they still want to take a precaution. Which is where a text or one of your suggestions above comes into play.",

It is a not a big one but it is not worth the benefit you get. For the same/similar level of inconvenience you could call someone, that way if something happens they can hear it and ask and get you help immediately. Instead of whatever elapsed time between texts (up to an hour in you LPT)+time waiting for a response+missed phone calls before calling 911. It is just so much worse than just calling someone.\n\nHaving your phone on you is a minor thing to remember to do and means you can call for help if you are able to. And having something with fall detection will automatically get you help. Both these methods are likely to get you help faster than this text method you are giving as a tip.\n\nAnd then at least for me knocking on one of my neighbours door and asking if they have a moment to spare while I go up in the attic would be as inconvenient or just sightly more inconvenient as texting someone and waiting for a response. But by asking my neighbour I get an actual person there which is so much better then a text.\n\nOf course I have texted people that I am home after a late night and I ask for them as well. But if the night ends and I don't get one or forgot to send one I don't wake up to the police banging at my door. I wake up the next day to a text that says \" you didn't message me last night, just making sure you are safe\".  Hours have passed and so much could have happened, but I don't expect my friends to call 911 if they didn't hear from me that night (not like they would do anything anyways). I would also consider  this a find my dead body faster measure. When enough time has passed for my disappearance to matter the time I disappeared will be much clearer.\n\nYou might think because I call it a \"find my dead body faster\" measure I think it is bad. I don't. Surely sometimes if you find my body faster I won't be dead, but most times it is going to be bad. I still ask people to let me know when they get home when my discretion says it is wise (which is the heart of this supposed LPT, discretion). But I don't do it because I think it will save their life, I do it so if something does happen it is clear that something bad happened to them. And i think that knowing something bad happened to them like 8 or 12 hours ago (which is definitely better than a few days) is an acceptable risk for the level of effort it took to ask them to text me.\n\nBut if I would be worried sick if I didn't get \"I am home message\" that night, then I would use my discretion and choose something more effort that gives me more piece of mind. I could drop the person home, I could take a taxi with them where they get off first, I could call an uber for them, I could ask them to be on call with me while they taxi home (this would probably only take 40 minutes and I would know when they get home), we could do some location sharing, etc.\n\nThat's the problem with this LPT it is half-assed. For the amount of effort the benefit is minimal. For less effort you can get comparable benefit and for a little more effort you can get a significantly better benefit. It feels like your LPT is for someone who 1) lives alone 2) needs to spend extended time in the attic 3) is comfortable climbing a ladder and spending extended time in the attic alone but 4) doesn't want to inconvenience someone for that long (by either being there or being on a phone call)\n\nYeah in this situation texting someone makes sense. But that is not most people. A lot of people don't live alone and not a lot of people need to spend extended time in the attic. So most people are not going to text someone for a rather short task that they are comfortable doing.\n\nAlso I forgot this applied to step ladders too. But if you need to text someone you are using a step ladder to get something off a shelf just ask someone to come over or at least call them",

THE.  TIME.  All this OP shows is that humans suck at truly understanding and evaluating risk.  Falling off a ladder involves not understanding the physics of how a ladder works, not following the rules and climbing beyond your strength/ability.  These people shouldnt be encouraged to call Grandma every time a football gets stuck in a gutter- they should learn how to use a ladder properly or not at all.  It's absolutely not rocket science.  \n\nYou advice is akin to \"Don't  like wearing a seatbelt?  Call the fire dept and tell them when and which way you are driving across town so they can come check for your body quicker.\"\n\nLife involves risk.  Every day has some risk to it.  Thousands of people die in spectacular and mundane ways every single day, all over the world.  Trust me, I've watched many of them do it firsthand.  If you can't face that reality, let's admit it- you have failed at understanding life.  \n\nWhat you are advocating is a life of sad, fearful phobias, which is exactly what the world doesn't need any more of.\n\nETA:  a simple google shows that bathroom falls are far more common and far more fatal than ladder falls, most of which are from construction work- ie experienced people who do it all the time.  Why aren't you texting your neighbor every time you take a shit (17,000 toilet related falls each year, more fatalities than ladders) if you are so afraid of your own shadow all the time?",

It\u2019s the same as texting a friend to let them know you got home safe after hanging out, or calling your mom when you get home from a trip.
