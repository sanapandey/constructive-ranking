Unless you're planning well ahead I find I rarely marinade meat / especially chicken long enough for the best results. The freezing then thawing really helps the flavour get into the meat. \n\nI can go to my freezer in the morning and pull out from a selection of tikka, honey soy, lemon garlic and herb, middle eastern, peri-peri, BBQ, etc.\n\nNot only is the flavour better but it makes choosing what to have for dinner somehow easier.

Sprinkle a small amount on the meat and massage it in, then let it sit for about 15 minutes before cooking.\n\nHow it works: Baking soda has an alkaline nature, which can help break down proteins in meat, resulting in a more tender texture.",

Otherwise, do it ahead of time. \n\nWhen you cook meat, the high heat causes the muscles (proteins) to contract, which squeezes out juices. The higher the temp, the more they squeeze. That\u2019s why cooking chicken breast to 160\u00b0F or above dries the chicken out so much. If you cook it to like 145-150 but hold it at that temp for 10 mins or so (ie, take it off direct heat), it\u2019ll be more tender (and still safe because pathogens die at those temps, just not instantly like at 160, but after 10 mins or so at 150 will kill them). \n\nSo since it\u2019s the muscles constricting, another thing you can do to keep it tender besides cooking it to a lower internal temp is to breakdown the proteins a bit before cooking. That inhibits how much they can squeeze when raised to high temps. That\u2019s one of the reasons for brining food. Yes, it gets salt deeper into the meat to season it. But it also denatures some proteins, leading to more tender meat that doesn\u2019t squeeze out as much juice when cooking. \n\nRaising the pH of the food also denatures proteins. It\u2019s more limited to just the surface of the meat (which is why it\u2019s particularly useful for thin slices of meat like in stir fries), but it also works faster than brine, IME. You can get a good benefit from just 5-10 mins of it. Whereas brining really needs to be at least 30 mins to have any effect at all, and really should be multiple hours to even days, depending on the cut and size. \n\nBonus tip: add some baking soda to the water to parboil potatoes before roasting them. It helps breakdown the surface of the potatoes and gives you MUCH more crispy roasted potatoes. \n\nExtra bonus tip/fun fact: You can also add baking soda to the pasta water for spaghetti and it makes the noodles a lot chewier like Asian wheat noodles. It\u2019s not quite as good, but it\u2019s a nice little hack in a pinch. Say it\u2019s a weeknight and you have some stir fry stuff (or a frozen Trader Joe\u2019s bag) but are out of rice. And you have spaghetti but no sauce. You could make something like a lo mein-ish dish by cooking your spaghetti in alkaline water then tossing together with your stir fry/Chinese food.",

The chicken comes out perfectly tender when I cook it. Do you think this marinade is doing it by denaturing the protein or is it something else?
