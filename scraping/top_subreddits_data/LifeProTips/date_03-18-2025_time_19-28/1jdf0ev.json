However if news is ALWAYS getting you increasingly worked up then you could be too wrapped up in it. Kinda of like when it feels like your whole life depends on it. \n\nI can tell when my friends are in this state when they can\u2019t hold a level conversation about a news topic. They are instantly angry, don\u2019t consider other perspectives and start citing all kinds of evidence for their view which are usually reels, podcast, tweets, or videos they\u2019ve been consuming on line. They have lost the ability to have an even keel conversation. (You should be able to do this with VERY hard/controversial topics imo). In really bad cases, they start ex-communicating or cutting people out of their lives that don\u2019t parrot the perspective they have worked themselves up over. There are times where that can be warranted but those are pretty extreme and different for everyone. (An example for me might be explicit racism or hate speech)\n\nI get pissed at headlines or articles, but they don\u2019t put me in that type of a state generally. I am mad at what\u2019s happening but I am not like vein in my forehead is bulging mad- if that makes sense.\n\nIf after seeing a tough headline you think of the implications and actions you might take as a result but then move on with your day/life then you are mad at the news but you are not in a state of anger. Which is healthy imo.\n\nIdk if that helps, but just trying to distinguish the difference, for me. It\u2019s kind of like not getting too worked up over it because that\u2019s not gonna help anything anyway. Being angry doesn\u2019t create change, it just deteriorates relationships. If you are that \u201cupset\u201d, channel it into things you can do and do them with grace not vitriol.",

I mean, good for you I guess. Are you aware that the government is now ignoring court orders and sending hundreds of supposed criminals (but who had no court hearing and we have no idea who these people are) to a prison in El Salvador known for human rights abuses?  Or that the government is targeting legal permanent residents for deportation and bypassing the legal process for revoking green cards because they don't like things they've said?  Or that the president just implied that Biden's pardons aren't valid and the entire January 6th committee should be investigated?\n\nSeems important to know that democracy is in free fall.

He argues that instead of consuming news, we should read books and magazines that actually explain the world and are well-researched (Nature, Atlantic Monthly...) and at most read the weekly summary page of The Economist to stay up-to-date.\n\nThe essay is 11 pages, and if you think that's too long to read and you can't focus on such a long text, then you've probably consumed too much news ;)  (news being short, easily-digestable articles and clips)\n\nThen there's also this article by Mark Manson (author of The Subtle Art of not giving a F*ck) on why you should quit the news:\n\n    https://markmanson.net/why-you-should-quit-the-news\n\nHe recommends to limit yourself to publications like *The Economist* , *Financial Times* , and *Foreign Policy* , because these don\u2019t give a shit if their articles are fun or not. The main point of his article is: **You want your news to be a little bit dull. If you\u2019re getting excited or worked up reading something, chances are you\u2019re being taken for a ride.**\n\n\nAnd finally, there is another article by Mark Manson that's related to this, about the Outrage Cycle:\n\n    https://markmanson.net/the-life-cycle-of-outrage",
