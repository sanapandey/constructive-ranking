With the current state of things in the US the job market is bound to get worse as things continue to get more expensive. Don\u2019t wait until after it\u2019s an emergency to start taking next steps and thinking creatively. In fact, I recommend coming up with a plan while you\u2019re still employed. What\u2019s an area of interest? What\u2019s an affordable program? What institutions offer the program you\u2019d be interested in? When are their enrollment cycles?\n\nTake care of yourself and always have a plan b!",
