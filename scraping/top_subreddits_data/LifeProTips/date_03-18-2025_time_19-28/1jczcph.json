    "selftext": "I hadn\u2019t paid much attention to this until I came across a powerful quote from the\u00a0Deep Work\u00a0book by Cal Newport:\n\n**\"It\u2019s crucial that you figure out in advance what you\u2019re going to do with your evenings and weekends before they begin.\"**\n\nIt was like a cold shower. I stopped reading and did a quick math.\n\nThere are 168 hours in a week. Let\u2019s break down an average, non-holiday week:\n\n* 40 hours for a full-time job\n* 56 hours for sleep (am I being generous here?)\n\nThat leaves us with 72 hours.\n\nAssuming we need about 6.5 hours daily for routines like eating, cooking, commuting, chilling, reading, and exercising, that\u2019s 45.5 hours per week. Now think about it - 6.5 hours a day is just 90 minutes shorter than a workday.\n\nAfter all that, we still have an impressive 24+ hours left each week.\n\nWhich means, if we don\u2019t plan, we\u2019re likely to end up without doing anything that could make our lives better or push us forward a little.\n\nSo what\u2019s changed for me?\n\nHere\u2019s my rough plan for those 24 hours:\n\n* Essential: 6-9 hours dedicated to this newsletter (yes, it\u2019s surprisingly time-consuming).\n* Semi-essential: 4-6 hours for family and social activities. (I know, this should be a top priority, but I\u2019m being honest. If there\u2019s an emergency or deadline, I might have to dip into this time budget after all.).\n* Non-essential: 3-5 hours for guilty pleasures like TV shows, YouTube, and other entertainment.\n* Essential: 2-4 hours for house maintenance (by default, our environment tends toward entropy, so we need to maintain it.).\n* Non-essential: 2-4 hours for learning something new.\n* Non-essential: 2-4 hours for extra workouts.\n\n\n\n",

That way if I have some free time and want to do something, I'm more likely to do that instead of doom scrolling on my phone. You don't need to plan your time if you want to do something, just make it easier to access~",

For me, I need at least 30 minutes of laying in bed just to calm my thoughts and relax and be able to fall asleep. i usually read or watch tv before bed, so I would plan 9 hours of laying in bed per night. plus, i think everyone has a nightime routine before going to sleep (toilet, brush teeth, skincare, maybe a shower, close windows, change into sleepwear, prepare clothes for next day?, etc) so I would actually place that also in the \"sleep\" category, because it is strongly tied together. so that would be about another 20-30 minutes.\n\nSo in total for me it should be 9:30 hours pers day for sleep (I'm not saying I achieve this every night, but this would be ideal planning), which means i should use up 66.5 hours a week just for sleep. \n\nif anyone is reading this and thinking \"not everyone needs 8 hours of sleep, i can function on six hours just fine, been doing it for years\" etc. i took this info from \"Why we sleep\", a book by Matthew Walker. \n\nAlso, for a lot of people in my country, we work 8 hours +1 hour or 0.5 hours lunch break (which I use and should be used for eating). That means the workday is actually 9 hours. So the weekly work hours time is 63 hours. \n\nSo if I have 168 hours a week - 66.5 hours to sleep -63 hours for work, I am left with 38.5 hours to myself.
