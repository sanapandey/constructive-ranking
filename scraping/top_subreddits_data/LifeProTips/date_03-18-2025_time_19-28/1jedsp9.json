    "selftext": "This is probably a stupid tip, but when you\u2019re painting inside or outside your home, wear a baseball cap. Not only does it keep the paint out of your hair when rolling or spraying paint, but when you inevitably lean forward and touch your greasy, sweaty forehead on the wall, you don\u2019t get paint on your head. And painting over sweat/oil with any latex or non-oil-based-paint is a nightmare. Better a little brim spot than your whole forehead \n\nEdit: some of you are coordinated. I\u2019m jealous. When it comes to standing on short ladders, I fall forward like every time. I will try my best to quit my behavior, but nevertheless I\u2019m gonna keep wearing a brimmed hat so I don\u2019t stick my whole face into wet paint ",
