Every one of this guy's problems come down to the fact that every human on the planet is incentivized to pursue money to the exclusion of any other set of values or priorities. Whoever set up the bots harassing this guy just want his money, the games industry that makes products so addicting that this guy feels content living in his basement glued to a screen and never encountering real women makes those games for money, every other force in our lives that railroad us all to work jobs for the profit of others that take up so much time and mental effort that we lean so goddamn hard into escapism as a coping mechanism. All of these forces shaped this man, shaped the culture that molded such a pathetic thing. It's fucking sad. \n\nI'm a proud feminist and it's still fucking sad to see these ideas having consumed this man's mind. To imagine what he could have been, the fulfillment he could have, the positive relationships he might have built, positive contributions he could have made to the lives of other men *and* to those of women, if he had not become what he is. He's a person too, women are not the only victims of the patriarchy. It's sad on his account, and also on account of his contribution to the problem as a result.",

Even if you think physically he's not most people's cup of tea, a personality has gotten a lot of people a lot of mileage. He only looks like that because he never learned the methods or importance of caring for himself properly, probably never had a notion how to approach or a motivation to explore his own personal fashion. As I said in another comment, this comes down to culture. We've normalized sitting in your basement and playing video games all day, there are enormous communities online of people just like him that allow him to feel like his way of life is good. \n\nWe've also eroded any tradition of getting out and taking part in community. It's not that the options aren't there most of the time, though car culture has turned most of our outdoors into parking lots and 18-lane mega-highways rather than spaces humans are motivated to engage with and encounter each other, but to a large degree we as a culture have decided that sitting inside and watching TV or playing video games or sitting on our phones is normal. We've decided the outdoors is often unsafe, social interactions with others can be frightening because you never know when someone is going to come out of nowhere and tell you you're \"Objectively not a good looking male standard\"",
