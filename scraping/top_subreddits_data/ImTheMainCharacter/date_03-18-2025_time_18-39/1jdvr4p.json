Otherwise, it will be removed.\n\n**Main Character (abbreviated as MC):** *Deliberate attention-seeking behavior, entitlement, or individuals thinking they are more privileged.*\n\n**Questions to consider:**\n- Is it easy to tell who the MC is?\n- Does the MC show entitlement and/or attention seeking behavior?\n- Is the MC very inconsiderate of the people around them?\n- If your post is about parking, does it show the blatant disregard of parking rules?\n  \nSee any violating comments? **Report them.** This is a massive community, so moderators don't have time to scroll through all the comments of every individual post. Instead, we use the queue to moderate. By using the report feature, we can see the flagged content in the queue and therefore moderate faster.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When someone tells you who they are, you should believe them, but I believe most people strive to be good people. I know some women who I would\u2019ve guessed would get married that never married and are single in their 40\u2019s, but great people\u2026 these situations were from the women choosing the wrong partner. One woman had 2 relationships that were around 10 years each with dudes that were open about not wanting to get married. Another, the woman dated on and off for years, and would just get tired and move on. Never took getting married seriously until she was in her 40\u2019s, but had basically dated every single guy in the social circle.\n\nA real man has very basic needs. A good woman isn\u2019t on his \u201cneeds\u201d list, but is on his \u201cwants\u201d list. The trick is to show the value that you can bring to his life, and he will begin wanting you in his life more and more. Sex is important to get the rocket off the ground (not too early tho; he has to see more value in you before sex), but what keeps the rocket in orbit are the things you that show him what\u2019s missing in his life. Not to sound sexist, but honestly cooking, cleaning, and showing your great with children tend to appeal to most guys. If that isn\u2019t in your wheel house, that\u2019s OK. Find a guy that aligns with the value you can provide him, and he\u2019ll promote you from his \u201cwants\u201d list to his \u201cneeds\u201d list.",
