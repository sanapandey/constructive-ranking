And these tribes had huge caches of weapons, like heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, boxes of grenades, you name it. They knew individual vigilantism, even in a country that was lawless in many ways, could lead to bloodbaths. If someone was known to have hurt children, they would be dealt with, but only after lengthy discussions and confirmation by witnesses from all sides. The police were corrupt and useless, the country was in about as bad a shape as any country could be in every way, but the Iraqis still believed in wiser and calmer heads prevailing, when they could have gone full Arnie in Terminator2.
