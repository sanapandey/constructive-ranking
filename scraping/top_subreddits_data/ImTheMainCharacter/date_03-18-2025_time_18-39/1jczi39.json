I did that on a train when some religious people decided to do an impromptu song with a guitar and everyone was really annoyed.\n\nWas in northern Uk when a bunch of these super happy Christian got on the train be really over happy and loud. About 10 minutes into the train, while everyone else is being perfectly quiet and trying to ignore the loud group, they decided to try and lead the whole train car in a song. They got about 20 seconds in before I snapped and shouted in an overtly obnoxious tone, \u2018would you fucking prats shut the fuck up\u2019. \n\nThey kinda did, got lots of evil glares while their song sort of dwindled away. They were still loud but definitely not as loud as pre song\n\nAs far as the other passengers, I got a few good snorts and giggles. I know somewhere there is definitely a video as there were people filming, I always hope it surfaces",
