But that's when I was a kid this dude looks well into his late 20s, 30s maybe.\n\nEdit: he might not even be one bit embarrassed and just is extremely immature but I was just saying from personal experiences. Side note I really do not like this guy. Leave Andrew alone \ud83d\ude2d",

Say what you will about JiDion, but I can respect any person who is putting up a fight against those vile people. \n\nSidenote: he still does it in his own trolling manner, but he has changed his content around for a while and has bettered himself.
