Otherwise, it will be removed.\n\n**Main Character (abbreviated as MC):** *Deliberate attention-seeking behavior, entitlement, or individuals thinking they are more privileged.*\n\n**Questions to consider:**\n- Is it easy to tell who the MC is?\n- Does the MC show entitlement and/or attention seeking behavior?\n- Is the MC very inconsiderate of the people around them?\n- If your post is about parking, does it show the blatant disregard of parking rules?\n  \nSee any violating comments? **Report them.** This is a massive community, so moderators don't have time to scroll through all the comments of every individual post. Instead, we use the queue to moderate. By using the report feature, we can see the flagged content in the queue and therefore moderate faster.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We got to him. I asked him \"who is this\" and he said \"you\".. And I caught the issue immediately. Every time someone pointed to a picture of him they said \"look that's YOU. And so when asked he repeated what he had  heard so many other people say.\n\nI wanted to correct this but... How? I can't say..\"that's not YOU, Thats ME.\" cause that's even worse. I tried saying \"thats (name)\" using his name to which he just replied \"that's you\"..\n\nI promptly distracted him with a toy and put the photo up and walked away. I just figured his parents can sort that mess out.",
