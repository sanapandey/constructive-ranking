The guy had a fake gun and pulled it out to rob the group. One of the people in the group pulled out their gun and killed him. The idiot's friend was yelling that it was a prank but it was too late. No charges were filed because authorities said the person acted in a reasonable manner when it came to self defense. Losing your life because of a stupid and dangerous \"prank\" is ridiculous",
