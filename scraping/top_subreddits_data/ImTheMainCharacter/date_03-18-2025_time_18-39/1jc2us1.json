One flight a mother and her six children were sitting in my row. I\u2019m a big guy. So I paid for two seats (it was also a trans Africa flight of about 10 hours. So added space was needed). In walks the mom and kids in tow to the flight. They plop down and take up an entire row and a half (including the two seats (aisle middle) I had paid for). I called the Ethiopian flight attendant over. All she did was shrug and say there was nothing she could do. The kids needed to travel with their mom.  So I asked if I could get reimbursed for the seat I paid for that was now occupied by two children. She said no. \n\nSo yeah. Fuck Ethiopian. Gross planes. Horrrible service.
