Otherwise, it will be removed.\n\n**Main Character (abbreviated as MC):** *Deliberate attention-seeking behavior, entitlement, or individuals thinking they are more privileged.*\n\n**Questions to consider:**\n- Is it easy to tell who the MC is?\n- Does the MC show entitlement and/or attention seeking behavior?\n- Is the MC very inconsiderate of the people around them?\n- If your post is about parking, does it show the blatant disregard of parking rules?\n  \nSee any violating comments? **Report them.** This is a massive community, so moderators don't have time to scroll through all the comments of every individual post.

But you ain't seen nothing until you visit a school and observe hundreds.\n\nI've called kids out for breaking the rules and gotten this exact reaction: being called anything from a snitch to a racist, the blatant denial that they did anything wrong despite looking at me and seeing me looking at them *while* they did it (or when we pull up video camera footage of them doing it), and the panicky non-stop nervous chatter, because, for some reason, their defense mechanism is to talk on and on and on, as if not letting the adults get a word in edgewise is somehow going to prevent consequences.\n\nNow, when I watch videos on Reddit of adults, I am reminded of the preteens I with with. It's amazing to think how little some people truly mature, or how some situations make some people revert back to this behavior.",

Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disability in social, occupational, or other important activities. An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss, such as the death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder. Socially deviant behavior (e.g. political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict results from a dysfunction in the individual, as described above.\n\nFrom the DSM-V. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/rethinking-mental-health/201307/the-new-definition-mental-disorder?amp\n\nIt\u2019s not possible to diagnose someone from one video but it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility that mental illness has something to do with this either. \n\nI get the impulse to think calling this a mental disorder is demonizing other people with mental disorders. But at the same time, if we approach this kind of behavior from a mental health perspective we could probably solve more problems than just yelling into the wind.",

If the police conducted a field sobriety test to give themselves  time to observe her behavior, she would very likely fail or refuse to complete it with her uncooperative attitude alone, and in the process she probably wouldn't be able to keep herself from committing a crime like poking or pushing one of them with her fat fingers and screaming more, and then she could be arrested for basic battery or obstruction. She'd probably resist arrest in the process as well. Cops give people lots of chances but if someone is totally out of control of themselves they shouldn't be driving a car and need to be taken into custody. They basically need a time out like a toddler. Sometimes that's overnight in jail, sometimes it's 10 minutes in the back of a police car.",
