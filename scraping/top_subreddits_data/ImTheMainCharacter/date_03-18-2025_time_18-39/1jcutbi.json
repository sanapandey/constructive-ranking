Otherwise, it will be removed.\n\n**Main Character (abbreviated as MC):** *Deliberate attention-seeking behavior, entitlement, or individuals thinking they are more privileged.*\n\n**Questions to consider:**\n- Is it easy to tell who the MC is?\n- Does the MC show entitlement and/or attention seeking behavior?\n- Is the MC very inconsiderate of the people around them?\n- If your post is about parking, does it show the blatant disregard of parking rules?\n  \nSee any violating comments? **Report them.** This is a massive community, so moderators don't have time to scroll through all the comments of every individual post. Instead, we use the queue to moderate. By using the report feature, we can see the flagged content in the queue and therefore moderate faster.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
