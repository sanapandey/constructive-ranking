She has one of the most unique armors in the game and it\u2019s so much ass at the point you get it.\n\nKetheric gave us usable gear for a lot of act 3 and it was good gear. All of it. I just feel like Orin\u2019s armor is completely useless. You\u2019re practically at the end of the game. There aren\u2019t a ton of persuasion checks to be made at this point.",

What she doesn't have, though, are genitals, since those are added separately on top of the Barbie Crotch and devs never made an unique genital for her.",
