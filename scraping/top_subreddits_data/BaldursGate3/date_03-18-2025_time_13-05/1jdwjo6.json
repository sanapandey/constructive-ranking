The notion of a Wizard who can protect others via their ward made me think of Paladins and Clerics, which led to the more regal inspiration for the look.\n\n[Wizard Tav](https://imgur.com/a/93ou6lg)",

He's a kind soul despite his tough exterior, and he's developing a crush on the Blade of Frontiers. Just started his run this past weekend (immediately after finishing his sister's run).\n\nThey were each other's guardian, as I like to think they were both captured and it's just different timelines in which one perished and the other escaped, and the Emperor used their desire to reunite with their sibling to manipulate them.\n\nMods: extra gear, HW boring dyes, astralites hair colors, vessnelle hairs.",

Her name is Nia. She's a paladin of Lethander and previously came from the hells and serving Asmodeus. Her name then was Nyxora. She wasn't proud of her actions and decided to start a new with the Lord of Dawn. Nia met the others when she got infected with a tadpole and she and Gale settled down in Waterdeep once they solved their tadpole problem. I did use mods but I'm not sure which ones they were. There were a few hair mods and a more horn options mod.",

Qelkax has little memory of his past, nor who he really is, his only memories coming in the form of nightmares. His choice of attire, or lack thereof, is part of that - Something about the feel or texture of rough fabrics causes him to lash out at himself in frenzied scratching fits, clawing at his scales to try and free himself from bindings he fears are still trapping him, hearing nothing but the maniacal laughs of a woman ringing in his ears.\n\nAside from this, he's a relatively nice man to be around, although he is ruthless towards people who wrong him, or harm people he cares about and, as such, he tends to distance himself from others. He's got something of a green thumb, and is an incredibly skilled alchemist - Poisons are his speciality, but he's just as adept at creating a potent healing salve as he is a deadly toxin.",
