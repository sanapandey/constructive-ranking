Look at Space Marine - a dedicated, clear roadmap that keeps people playing. You are dead right, developers need to take accountability for a poor / mediocre game.

As well as paid cosmetics as long as gameplay-wise all the elements are available to all the players equally. I mean they release whole new modes and operations for free. So it's just seems a bit weird to not play the game at all for them having limited events with some special helmet or smth. It's like the most insignificant element of the game",
