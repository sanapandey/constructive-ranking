Then I went looking for my own group to play with and now I\u2019m in two homebrew D&D campaigns and a pathfinder group. Playing as a bard, a rogue and a monk. Still preferring the dex classes just like I do in BG3.",

I'd advise giving the series another chance and at least getting though episode 3, where it starts to put them back on track for where the excellent story from the campaign is supposed to be. The crudeness is still a bit excessive at times but it lessens overtime as the group \"matures\".    \n\n\nThe problem is the story starts *in media res* and the group should already be heros by now, but translate that to the screen and the new audience will feel like they are missing a lot of important background. But if the party is shown starting at a new zero point as so called \"pathetic losers\", it _seems_ like you are seeing the start of their heros journey.",

But if the party is shown starting at a new zero point as so called \"pathetic losers\", it _seems_ like you are seeing the start of their heros journey.  \n\nI'd advise giving the series another chance and at least getting though episode 3, the first two were written just as the new introduction for the show and three starts to put them back on track for where the excellent story from the campaign is supposed to be. The crudeness is still a bit excessive at times but it lessens overtime as the group \"matures\".  \n\nUltimately yes it doesn't quite fit the tone you'd want for a BG series, LoVM is too \"modern\" in the way its humor is written specifically to make a certain type of audience think its funny.",

Hasbro are the ultimate owners of D&D, Forgotten Realms and the \u201cBaldur\u2019s Gate\u201d name, and many other related properties. Its a matter of Hasbro wanting to license out the brand, the characters etc to whoever they want to produce this. For example, the d&d movie was a licensing agreement between Hasbro and Paramount.\n\nThe way this works is that the IP owner (hasbro) will either decide internally to produce something like this and will approach someone they feel is capable and will make them an offer (this is how BG3 was made in the first place). Sometimes, someone connected will pitch the IP owner for a project of their own initiative, and they will either decline or accept. Sometimes is a broader deal, like it will allow you to develop what you want to do in a given medium with, for example, any brand connect to the D&D IP in general (it has many brands, just \u201cD&D\u201d, or \u201cForgotten Realms\u201d or \u201cBaldur\u2019s Gate\u201d, \u201cNeverwinter Nights\u201d or \u201cRavenloft\u201d ), but with D&D these broad development deals rarely happen. \n\nAn animated show *might* happen, because Hasbro has repeatedly shown interest in exploring the D&D IP in film and TV. Currently, there is a live action shown set in this universe simply titled \u201cForgotten Realms\u201d in development for Netflix.",

Well, Wizards of The Coast owns it, and by extension, Hasbro (its parent company).\n\nBut hold your horses, there is an important distinction here. Larian obviously has the rights over the game itself they created. So, because they themselves are the publisher, they get to commercialize, distribute and economically explore the game, probably in perpetuity. There are also stuff that isn't the game itself but that they probably either own or share (depends on the clauses of the deal) like some types of merch, the BG3 logo. Obviously, considering that it is a video game, the technology, the software etc is all owned by Larian.\n\nThe relevant part is that characters, places, names, the universe, the original brand (so like, \"Baldur's Gate\" in general, not just \"Baldur's Gate 3\") are all Hasbro. And this isn't some clever ploy they pulled, this was the ideia from the start. The fact that Larian doesn't want to do another one doesn't alter this, that was just Hasbro wanting to either extend their original licensing/development deal or make a new one, and Larian declining (for reasons that haven't conclusively been revealed, though I have some good guesses). \n\nIn olden times, Interplay had a similar deal. The characters, narrative and etc were always owned by WoTC, but Interplay (the publisher of the OG games) had the rights over their distribution. But because they went bust, WoTC/Hasbro got the rights to the actual distribution of BG1 and 2 back (it stayed in limbo/partially owned by Atari for a long time) and then they licensed it to Beamdog who made the remastered versions currently on Steam for example.",

Each layer is super different and has its own challenges like Malbolge having diseases and toxic plants as well as all the boulders rolling everywhere while Stygia has waters that make you forget stuff. Phlegethos is of course like just hellfire everywhere and you get burnt to a crisp and lava. Oh and Cania is so cold you just freeze to death and there\u2019s white dragons wandering around too. \nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna write out every single layer for brevity\u2019s sake but yeah the Hells is brutal and everything you eat tastes like ash and your drinks taste terrible like bile or spoiled milk. You can\u2019t have nice stuff they just turn awful. The lower planes in general also corrupts people too so there\u2019s that. \n\nThen there\u2019s the denizens of the Hells and how brutal they are and how they\u2019ll wanna torture you to make the energy in soul coins and the devils that specialise in torture like chain devils and excruciarchs. Or you could just be tortured because some devil likes it and is bored or just killed. Course you could be enlisted into the blood war too.",

Dis is awful like with all the screaming everywhere and the superheated metal of the city, but still relatively tame. If I ever went there as an autistic person I think I\u2019d lose my mind cause of it being crowded and loud in the worst ways. \n\nCan I talk about the Abyss too? Sorry if I\u2019m rambling I LOVE fiends and the lower planes. My favourite layer(s) in the Abyss is the Triple Realm/Azzagrat where Graz\u2019zt rules over! It\u2019s layers 45-47. His palace (the Argent Palace, it\u2019s full of mirrors) in Zelatar goes through all three of them. It\u2019s different from the other places in the Abyss cause they actually let traders in and stuff (though sometimes he\u2019ll just yoink or attack a trader if they catch his eye) and you gotta pay a fee to demons to leave the portal. There\u2019s different towns on each layer there\u2019s Fogtown, Gallenghast and Darkflame. Layer 45 makes everything all muted and muffles screams and people get lost and forget stuff. 46 is all bright and glowy and makes shadows in the sky. 47 is really cool because it makes hot stuff cold and vice versa so in campaigns fire spells and ice spells act differently. The sun is also blue and people disguise themselves with the low light. There\u2019s also this river of salt running through Azzagrat that can kill you.",

It's impossible to say it'd be a disservice to the game when it doesn't exist. This exact argument could be used against a potential BG4.\n\nBG2 did this by canonizing who was in your party which is a lot more foundational to individual stories. Forget them canonizing a romance, you might have never even met you're entire party depending on your choices.\n\nNot to mention, to make a good show they would have to take creative liberties anyway that would separate it enough from the show for people to realize it's a different \"universe\" than the game, as is the case with a most adaptations.\n\nThe fact is, these characters are insanely popular and WOTC knows this.  \nThey will exist again in other games, crossovers, comics, novels, etc etc.  \nThere will likely be a \"canon\" romance for some of these characters, show or not.",

Especially since he had the least amount of story in the game.\n\nStart with his story of how he got the scar when he fought a Minotaur - serving as a symbol for his willingness to sacrifice and take risks.\n\n\u201cDo the ends justify the means\u201d could serve as a great over arching theme with him facing various choices the game presents to make the tasks ahead easier.\n\n\nHe gets his mission to go after Karlach. Which would make sense to have him somewhat present during the events of Descent into Avernus.\n\nThere we could get a taste of a DnD party in action by perhaps having a cameo of the \u201cHeroes of Baldurs Gate\u201d at work with Minsc falling in the River Styx and losing his memory as per the comic.\n\nWe could also have an early brief interaction with Ulder and Wyll as Ulder suspects him there purely to save Elturel and has a moment of second guessing choosing to disown Wyll.. only to catch him speaking to Mizora and thinking Wyll is PURELY there to serve his pact.\n\nBing badda boom. They free Eltural, we get Zarial as a more prominent Villain pulling the strings for the events to come, Ulder Duke could ascends with Eltural and Wyll chooses to stay behind to hunt Karlach. \n\nSetting up the opening events of BG3 AND we could get   some early introductions to the Tiefling refugees. \n\nSpecifically Mol for some comic relief, setting up how she injured her eye.\n\nI could see there being a GREAT returning dynamic with Karlach / Wyll with Mol and trying to protect her as she looks up to them both and perhaps echoes their flaws.\n\nEdit: I also think for the series purpose itd work best to introduce the team much slower and have them get infected at different times.\n\nThis could be down by having a surviving Mind Flayer hiding away and collecting equipment to abduct powerful candidates for metamorphosis.\n\nIE a powerful wizard, a tiefling with an infernal heart, a vampire .. oh and whats this.. a Githyanki here to kill me?
