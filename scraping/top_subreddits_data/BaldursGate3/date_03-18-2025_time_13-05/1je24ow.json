Quality for Jaheira is great, but suffers for others, most notably Anomen, which is a terrible romance from what I heard (never could bring myself to romance the guy).",

Cool.  So to them good representation is taking up a few moments of a game that can take hundreds of hours to see everything\u2026.and then making everything vague.  So good representation is practically invisibility.\n\nId love to see a nonbinary or trans companion.  I\u2019d love to see them navigate that in terms of world building (imagine a trans drow).
