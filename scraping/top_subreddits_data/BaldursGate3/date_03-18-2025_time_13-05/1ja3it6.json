Easy peasy it's going well. But what I don't understand is: when one of us talks to a character with the exclamation point and goes through the scene, does that void the possibility of the other player experiencing that scene?\n\nI know we can 'listen' on any convos so that's not what I'm asking about. I'm asking if my friend does the 'stars' scene with astarion in early game will I ever get to experience the scene from my POV as well?\n\nThis information is crucial for us going forward since we don't want to waste any opportunities with characters.\n\nOnce again, not asking about 'watching' the scene but 'experiencing' it.\n\nThank you in advance!",

            "body": "This is more curiosity about whether it's happened to anyone else: Does Wyll just always bug out if he's dead when his first scene with Mizora is scheduled to occur? Or does something else trigger the bug?\n\nWyll heroically died trying to save a Tiefling from an assassin, but I was low on gold and am choosing not to use revivify scrolls this run. So I left him overnight - coincidentally the same night that Mizora was scheduled to appear. The next day, I revived him, and I did a full day's activities with him as normal.\n\nThat night, Mizora appeared. But afterward Wyll couldn't be talked to although his little dialogue exclamation notification was over his head. \"Another time, I'm busy.\" I tested a couple of things. I tried doing the scene while making sure he was in my party and I only had four party members (this has not been an issue in prior playthroughs, but). I tried long resting. I tried turning him off and back on again (i.e. killing and reviving him). Nothing. The only thing that worked was reverting to an older save and not letting him die heroically that day, so that the Mizora scene could play the first night it was scheduled to.\n\nIs this a known bug? Have I identified the cause or could it still be something else? Can it happen with any companion, and does it happen when you long rest with them dead or is it only when they have a scene scheduled?\n\nThis could be devastating on a single-save run...",

The new subclasses aren't going to be \"better,\" just different. I see that you want to play a monk - the new subclass of monk is a drunken fighter archetype, so it's pretty specific. The only reason I'd hold off is if I thought I might only play once and that really appealed to me over the already existing subclasses of monk. Open Hand and Way of Shadow are both really fun, and already in the game.",

In that case I would say there's not much point waiting to start, the new patch is mostly adding a new subclass for each class which just gives more options, but as a new player you already have tons of options.\n\n\n\n\nI would also not worry too much about multiclassing if you find it too confusing, the classes on their own are also very strong and more than sufficient to beat the game. My first playthrough I only did multiclassing on one character to try it out, the others I just kept them the same class the whole way to keep it simpler as I learned the game. Just know that there's not really any wrong choice, while some classes and combos are definitely stronger than others, any of the classes can be strong enough to beat the game. You can also change your class at any point so if you feel the one you choose isn't really your thing, you don't have to start a new game you can just change it and try something else!",

Once you try Wrath of the Storm (Tempest 2), it becomes really hard to convince yourself to ever give it up again when you build a new party.\n\nDraconic's Elemental Affinity (level 6) adds more flat damage to your lightning spells. If you got your CHA stat to 24, that's +7 to *each* hit of lightning dmg you do. On an AoE spell like Chain Lightning or even Lightning Bolt, that's quite a lot of extra damage thrown around the place per spell.\n\nStorm Sorcerer's Heart of the Storm damage buff (also level 6) isn't as much damage, and it's made lower when you multiclass. The appeal of Storm Sorcery is (1) Fly with a bonus action, and (2) learning extra storm-themed spells. Most notably (to most people), you'll get the opportunity to learn Call Lightning, which you can upcast as high as you want to *once,* and then recast repeatedly without using another spell slot (effectively allowing you to cast a Level 6 spell over and over again). Personally, I just liked getting Thunderwave (CHA) for free (so I could learn another spell in its place), because I rarely wanted to spend my concentration *and* my actions to recast Call Lightning.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in the early game, Draconic is less squishy (more HP and the equivalent of Mage Armour without spending a spell slot), but Storm allows you to Fly from level 1 without waiting around to learn Misty Step, or wasting a L2 spell slot on it.\n\n2 Cleric/ 10 Sorc (either Sorc) is a fantastic build. 2 Cleric/ 9 Sorc/ 1 Wizard will allow you more leeway with which Sorcerer spells you learn, because you can learn your utility spells from scribing Wizard Scrolls. 2 Cleric/ 8 Sorc/ 2 Divination Wizard means you can't learn Hold Monster (though you can buy scrolls!), but you will be absurdly busted (in fact, it's entirely too OP for my tastes). How? To be short: Div Wizard's Portent Die ensures that your lightning spell hits & Tempest's Wrath of the storm ensures that it does max damage & the wet condition ensures that damage is doubled.",

From what I've seen most people recommend Storm Sorcerer but I think Draconic works well too as it eventually gets to add Charisma proficiency bonus to lightning spells to increase damage. Personally I did Draconic just cause it felt more thematic for my Dragonborn sorcerer and it was super strong, but can't speak to whether or not storm would be better as I haven't tried that yet.",

So I'll add a single level of the secondary class. I'd do Rogue first because it has better proficiencies, but focus on Monk because if the idea is an unarmed fighter then Monk's abilities are more central to that.\n\n>then alternate rogue/monk until I hit rogue 3\n\nThis would probably be a bad idea, although since you're on Explorer it won't stop you from winning encounters. But you'll be noticeably underpowered.\n\nThe issue is that multiclassing is always a trade-off. You trade higher-level abilities in one class for lower-level abilities in another, delaying your power progression in both classes. Rogue needs Sneak Attack to do decent damage, but adding monk levels will reduce your Sneak Attack die so you won't get much sneak attack damage. Monk needs Extra Attack and the monk scaling to unarmed attacks, but adding Rogue levels delays both.\n\nOr to put it another way: a 3 Rogue / 3 Monk doesn't hit like a level 6 character. They hit more like a level 3 character.\n\nSo it's often better to focus on one class first, then add the second class once you've got the important features of the class unlocked. That's why it's common to suggest that martial multiclasses (like monk, paladin, etc) get to level 5 first to unlock Extra Attack. Personally, I will compromise and will delay Extra Attack by a level for RP/flavor, but it's not the most optimum strategy in terms of combat as you delay your progression by a level. This is most noticeable at level 5 when everyone else has Extra Attack and you don't.\n\nEDIT: Tavern Brawler  is only applicable to a monk that is either strength-based or using strength elixirs. You would probably have to use strength elixirs as you will need to put those points into dexterity to keep your AC high with this multiclass. Or you could just go to the traditional route and do dexterity-based monk without, which is not an overpowered meta build but is still good.",

You also probably want to get Tavern Brawler fear ASAP for Monk so If you start with rogue 3 and then go to monk it will be a while before that comes online.\n\n\n\n\nYou can always repec later to get the rogue skill proficiencies if you want, for example when you hit level 6 you can respec to start with 1 rogue and 5 monk. You'll miss out on the skill proficiencies early in the game though so depends if you're ok with that or not.",

That worry didn't last too long because the game is what it is, but there wasn't really the same worry about other boss changes.\n\nI think you're underestimating the difference that legendary actions can make. Legendary actions are one of the main ways bosses are balanced in tabletop: they give the boss extra actions, shifting action economy in their favor, and they're often extremely high damage or incapacitating, so that the boss can either deal comparable damage to a full party or reduce the party in number. (Sometimes both.) \n\nOrin's human-form legendary action can kill a character from full health. And not just downed but dead dead. The slayer form legendary action doesn't deal as much damage but is designed to knock characters off the platform to kill them that way instead.\n\nHer character sheet on the wiki doesn't list all of the relevant changes on honor mode. These legendary actions combine with >!Bhaal's Edict!<, which punishes you for not triggering them with a condition that >!forces you to kill someone on your turn or instantly die.!< It's not listed on her character sheet because it doesn't originate from Orin herself, but the combination makes the fight more challenging than the legendary actions would by themselves.\n\nActually unbeatable? No. There's always a strategy. But if we're ranking boss fights I would definitely put it much higher than Ketheric. I think the challenges that Ketheric poses (even on honor mode) are just a lot more straightforwardly countered with basic abilities.\n\nI do have a question for you, since it's been so long I fought Orin on Tactician: \n\n>Hold Monster for two immediate chances at 56%\n\nDoes she not have legendary resistance in Tactician?

She doesn't have the Honour-exclusive LA obviously. By \"immediate\", I would like to clarify that my Gale has the metamagic Quickened Spell and has two Lvl 5 spell slots, so he can cast 2 instances of Hold Monster for 1 turn.\n\nAs I don't fully understand the concept of Spell Save/ Spell Save DC yet, I'll give you the details and you should explain it to me instead. My Gale's stats are 8 12 16 18 14 8. Hold Monster uses Wisdom save. I equipped him the weapon **Markoheshkir** and helmet **Hood of the Weave** which grants +1 and +2 Spell Save DCs respectively. The other party members aside from Tav are Minthara and Jaheira (all her elemental summons are out). No Bardic Inspirations, no Haste. I don't know how the final calculations of Hold Monster vs Slayer Orin got to 56% chance.\n\nI'm willing to bet that the Marko and Hood Weave did all the lifting.",

For example, if you read the Necromancy of Thay, at some point you had to pass a wisdom saving throw to continue reading it without being cursed. You rolled a 1d20 and added your wisdom modifier and any other relevant bonuses, then compared that result to a number that represents the difficulty (DC)  of the roll, which is often just called the \"save DC.\" The DC might have been 15, 21, etc depending on your character's class and dialogue choices.\n\nYou also make saving throws in the background quite a lot. If you trigger a trap, for example, you will automatically roll a saving throw to determine if you resist/dodge the trap's effects. It shows up in your combat log but doesn't make you roll because that would be tooooo tedious.\n\nMany spells also have a saving throw to determine whether the target can resist the effects. The target rolls a 1d20 and adds the relevant modifier (e.g. wisdom modifier if it has a wisdom save) and any othe relevant bonuses. This is compared to the save DC of the spell, which will usually but not always be the spell save DC of the caster. (Some spells cast from items/scrolls are exceptions.)\n\n>I'm willing to bet that the Marko and Hood Weave did all the lifting.\n\nThey don't provide that large a bonus; the math just doesn't work out if Orin has legendary resistance. With the stats and gear that you've listed, Gale's spell save DC is:\n\n8 (base) + 4 (proficiency bonus) + 4 (intelligence modifier) + 1 (Markoheshkir) + 2 (Hood of the Weave) = 19. \n\nThis is on the low end for a wizard in the late game.\n\nIf she has legendary resistance, Orin's saving throw against Gale's Hold Monster is determined by:\n\n1d20 + 3 (wisdom modifier) +10 (legendary resistance). \n\nI think I might have misread and it's only a +13 bonus and not a +16 bonus, but it doesn't really make a big difference in terms of strategy; she only has to roll a 6 or above to beat Gale's spell save DC. And if you took the dialogue path that leads her to immediately become the Slayer, she has advantage on the roll.\n\nWithout legendary resistance, she needs to roll a 16. I haven't exactly solved this equation, but this makes a lot more sense if Gale's chance to land the spell was 56%.\n\nWhat this means re: the difficulty of the encounter in Tactician vs. Honor mode? Either she doesn't have legendary resistance in Tactician, in which case your strategy wouldn't have worked in Honor Mode, or there is a bug/oversight that affects her legendary resistance in both modes. I can't test which is true because unfortunately you can't switch between rulesets in a campaign.",

So that 56% I just mentioned for Hold Monster doesn't have penalties of the Legendary Resistance yet.\n\nTo verify this, I did a quick save of the moment Gale gets a chance to use Hold Monster against Orin, and in about 10 save scum attempts I did , only 2 of them passed through even with Quickened metamagic enabled. So its safe to say that I only got lucky the first time around.\n\nThat said, I retried the fight again because it felt like I didn't earn the win last time. I baited all of Orin's +10 Incapacitation bonuses with spells like Hold Person, Command: Halt, Tasha's Laughter, before dropping the nuke with Gale's Hold Monster. A bit cheesy that I still had to use Hold Monster, but whatever.\n\n**Another question if you don't mind.** The description states that Legendary Resistance Incapacitation can be used 3 times. What does this mean exactly? Is it 3 times per battle or 3 times per round? And also, does this trigger everytime I use a incapacitating spell regardless of whether it will fail or pass, or is it only used as a failsafe by the boss in case the initial check fails?\n\nIt sucks that the game doesn't track the usage count of this LA so I don't even know whether its still present or not after using a lot of CC spells to bait it.",

In simple terms, you roll a skill check to determine whether or not you can do something. You roll a saving throw to determine whether or not you can resist something. \n\n>I wish the devs allowed an option for us to see the dice rolls during combat\n\nIt would be exceedingly tedious if the game paused to show you the roll every time it happened; no one would want to play it. Almost every single action you take in combat involves a roll, often multiple rolls. But the rolls are recorded in the combat log, if you want to see how they worked for something you just did.\n\nI agree that BG3 doesn't do a great job of teaching all these mechanics. I think part of it is that the game was just a much bigger hit than anyone anticipated and it brought in a really diverse audience, rather than the more niche audience they probably expected.\n\n>Yes, Orin only has +3 to Wisdom Throws, not +6.\n\nYeah. On her wiki page, they list the bonuses to her saving throws separately from her ability scores, which I interpreted as an additional bonus (sometimes bosses have those). But it's actually just the ability modifier, so she has +3, not +3+3.\n\n>I found out that Legendary Resistance doesn't take into consideration when you're trying to use an effect spell against an enemy\n\nThis isn't true. The entire point of Legendary Resistance is that it keeps parties from trivializing boss encounters by disabling them with spell (or other) effects. I'm not sure if the source where you read this is incorrect, or if there is some sort of misunderstanding.\n\nBased on your testing, I think I know what happened, and it should have occurred to me earlier: Legendary Resistance is an ability that bosses use in reaction to being targeted. (Though it doesn't cost them a reaction point.) It's actually their choice to use it or not, it's not a passive bonus that is always active like an ability score modifier. That 56% chance of success was your chance *before* Orin decided to use her legendary resistance. You did indeed just get lucky.\n\n>Is it 3 times per battle or 3 times per round?\n\nThree times per battle. So you already hit on one strategy you can use: Hit the boss with lower-cost spells to burn through the Legendary Resistance, then use your higher cost spell (like that level 5 Hold Monster) once the Legendary Resistance is gone.\n\nThe computer is dumb; in tabletop a DM would know that this is what you're doing and would be using the Legendary Resistances strategically. They might decide to just take the effects of a lower level spell - better to be hit with Tasha's, which ends when someone does damage to you, than to be hit with Hold Monster.\n\n>It sucks that the game doesn't track the usage count of this LA \n\nCheck the combat log to see if they used it or not. Another thing to keep in mind is that they don't use it when they succeed on a saving throw without it, so unless you're paying attention to the log you won't know if they used it or not.",

I forgot to include that part.\n\nThe 56% of Hold Monster doesn't take into account the Legendary Resistance yet, but you already mentioned this so I won't repeat any further.\n\n>Check the combat log to see if they used it or not. Another thing to keep in mind is that they don't use it when they succeed on a saving throw without it, so unless you're paying attention to the log you won't know if they used it or not.\n\nNoted on this one. This will prove helpful.\n\n>The computer is dumb; in tabletop a DM would know that this is what you're doing and would be using the Legendary Resistances strategically. They might decide to just take the effects of a lower level spell - better to be hit with Tasha's, which ends when someone does damage to you, than to be hit with Hold Monster.\n\nThe game would be more difficult than it is right now if this was the case, and would just decrease viable strategies for no reason. In my opinion, this type of AI behavior should be left on fan mods and let LegRes baiting be a thing.",

You will have some additional dialogue options and a few additional scenes. It will pick up more in Act 2 (depending on the order you do things in, sooner or later). \n\nA specific recommendation that I have for you, to maximize your Durge content: If you're playing a resist Durge, be sure to recruit Jaheira and Minsc (but especially Jaheira), and have Jaheira in your party when you first long rest after arriving in Rivington. Jaheira is actually the companion who has the most content related to Durge, not any of the origin companions or even the companion that you're romancing.",

                    "body": "There is no one right answer to this, because it depends on what your goals are for the build and you personal preferences. Multiclassing is always a matter of trade-offs so you have to decide what you care about.\n\nFor example, many people will advice that when you're multiclassing a martial character you should get the martial class to level 5 before you start adding the second class. The reason is that martials get Extra Attack at level 5, which is extremely important; without it they're going to be underpowered compared to enemies and party members at the same level. However, the trade-off is that you don't get any of the lower-level abilities or flavor from the second class until near the end of Act 1. Personally, I often choose to delay Extra Attack just to get a level in the second class earlier.\n\nFor spellcasters, level 5 is also an important milestone because that's when you unlock level 3 spells. You usually don't want to delay those for too long because they really change your combat capabilities. That includes spells like Spirit Guardians (an amazing Cleric spell) and Call Lightning (an amazing Druid spell). So first I would decide whether I wanted to be more of a Cleric or more of a Druid, and I would prioritize getting that class to level 5 first.\n\nIf I wanted to focus more on Cleric, I would probably do Cleric 1 > Druid 2 > Cleric 5. The reason for putting two levels into Druid is that Circle of Stars unlocks at level 2 and I personally would want that early. It's a big compromise but worth it to me for RP/immersion reasons. You could also do Cleric 5 > Druid 2 if you don't care about that, or Cleric 1 > Druid 1 > Cleric 5 if you care about having a some basic druid abilities but not so much the specific subclass.\n\nIf I wanted to focus more on Druid, I would probably do Cleric 1 > Druid 5. The reason for only one level of Cleric is that the core Cleric spells (Guiding Bold, Bless) are unlocked on level 1. You get Channel Divinity at level 2, but I don't care as much about Knowledge Domain's version of that. If it was Tempest Cleric it would be different. The reasons for still doing Cleric first is to get the medium armor proficiency. Of course you could also do Druid 5 > Cleric 1, and then respec with Withers to get the armor proficiency (or not if you plan to wear light armor).\n\nSo this is a really specific example, but I think it comes down to:\n\n* What starting proficiencies matter to you; you only get partial starting proficiencies from the second class you add. \n\n* What class you want to focus on first.\n\n* How long you're willing to delay your class progression in your primary class in order to get lower-level abilities from your secondary class.",

Throw down a cloudkill where they're surrounding some poor bastards, they won't take damage because of heroes feast + enemies can't leave without risking multiple attacks of opportunity. I wouldn't waste any other buffs on them besides a nice ritual longstrider because they'll need to get to places in combat. If your entire party is half-illithid, I love putting the thrall shield on them as well, since they'll usually be in melee range when damaged and that just stuns whoever is dumb enough to strike them - which they will because the ghouls will have the lowest AC of your party.\n\nThey are a huge compliment to any ranged character, as expected. If you're a sorcerer, wizard, ranger, etc etc they'll faceroll themselves into enemies so your character can stay nice and safe - or at least threaten enemies so they receive disadvantage on their ranged attacks on you.\n\nIf you have melee characters in your party, just have them engage what the ghouls aren't and keep a tidy stock of cloudkill scrolls on you.\n\nThe turn order thing is a little annoying but honestly, you have 4 summons that can all paralyze enemies and block the hell out of enemies. Moreover, if your initiative rolls get blocked by them you need to improve on that and take the alert feat and/or work on your party's dexterity stat.\n\nKnow the location you're fighting at, too. Using them in the minsc fight is obviously not going to go well, since you're in a narrow tunnel for the first part of it. I also am unsure if they can do non-lethal damage at all. Most anywhere else though, they'll do great. They essentially nuked the house of hope's boss fight for me.",

So always check the vendors when starting a new day if you're low on something. You can also check them in between leveling up your party members. (Level up Astarion, check vendors, level up Gale, check vendors, etc.)\n\nThat said: As you level up these small healing potions will be less useful because the amount that they can heal you for will become a proportionally much smaller amount of your total health. You'll also be getting hit with bigger attacks. It's not worth stocking up on too many of them. And if you're finding that you're having to heal so much you're running out of potions despite buying them from vendors, then it's likely there is something that could be adjusted with your build or strategy (the first thing I would check is your AC), or it could be that you're not long resting enough (which restores you to full HP).",

The only exceptions are when you're in a hostile area where long resting is blocked, and when you've triggered one of the few time-sensitive quests. You will generally know that you shouldn't long rest because someone will be in immediate physical danger (e.g. trapped in a burning building or currently being attacked by monsters), or because the game gives you an actual countdown (i.e. it tells you something will happen in X days).\n\nLong resting does cost camp supplies, but they're plentiful.\n\n>i hear its best to spam it after each combat even if its fighting a boar, atleast if you used up one spell slot.\n\nI've never heard that and I wouldn't give that advice. As you say, it's gimmicky (and tedious). I generally suggest short resting after an encounter, and then long resting once you're out of short rests. You might long rest right before/after a boss fight as well, since you will probably be in worse shape after a boss fight than a normal fight.\n\nDND (which BG3 is based on) is much more restrictive about long resting, so it's expected that you'll pace yourself and not blow all your resources on a single fight (unless it's that boss fight). You might have to fight again before it's safe to rest. In BG3 long resting is so easy, but I still like to pick times to long rest when it feels better for the story, like after finishing an area.\n\nOn the flip side, you do need to long rest to see story scenes. If you push yourself too far without long resting you'll miss story scenes at camp.",

Astarion's Firebolt has the same issue.\n\nShadowheart's other starting damage cantrip, Sacred Flame, *does* come from her Class, and therefore *does* use her WIS stat. But instead of using an Attack Roll, it uses a Dexterity Saving Throw. The issue with a DEX save is that most enemies in Act 1 actually have very good DEX stats, so Sacred Flame isn't going to be very effective against them.\n\nBut it also sounds like you've invested in her CHA stat instead of her WIS stat, so are you even using her offensive Cleric spells? It certainly wouldn't be a good idea.\n\nPersonally, I do have Shadowheart use a bow for ranged weapon attacks until she gets more spell slots, but I also tend to keep her primarily a Cleric, and therefore invest in her WIS stat. But since *you* intend to make her primarily a Sorcerer, and you're investing in her CHA stat, then you should be just fine just using her Sorcerer cantrips for damage. Are her Sorcerer cantrips missing a lot too?\n\nYou might have an issue, because you'll have two types of Firebolt (assuming you learned Firebolt from Sorcerer too): one that uses INT, and one that uses CHA.

In this sort of situation your remedy would be to use a mod. On console you can summon a box of unique items through with the Cheaters Spell Scroll mod. There are other ways to do it on PC but since I don't play on PC I can't recommend a specific one.",

I'm saying she's *not* the most solid choice story-wise *unless* you want to >!turn her into a mindflayer.!< Unless I wanted to do that I would take my romance or my favorite companion as the third. She does give you an additional choice, but that choice isn't related to her personal backstory in the same way as Gale and Lae'zel. \n\nIf you're not spoiling yourself about that choice and you just want to have all options without necessarily committing to any of them, then take her. \n\n>Personally for me, it felt like every character that has a companion quest had ended their personal story arcs completely\n\nThey've ended in the sense that the part of their story having to do with their unique personal history is ended. However, they're all infected with tadpoles and are all on a quest to do something about it, and are therefore all personally invested in the outcome of the final battle. All of them have a reason to be there, so you can take along who you like and have that choice be fully justified.\n\nEven if your favorite is someone like Jaheira, who doesn't have a tadpole, they could want to be there for saving the world.\n\nNo choice will be fully \"lore accurate\" because the game limits you to three companions, and realistically, the others would not just be sitting out. Story wise it really should be everyone. You already have to come up with a headcanon for why you only have three companions anyway (maybe you imagine they're saving people in the city, maybe they're protecting the advance party from being pursued, maybe you're just not thinking about it).",
