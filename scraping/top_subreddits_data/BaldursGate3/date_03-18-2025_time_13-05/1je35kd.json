I might do a 30-something run later but I just don't feel like she'd be into the height difference with anyone. That said, I reckon she and Minsc would totally vibe as a couple, weirdly.\n\n\\*when I had to leave the group because I was moving away, she left the party to join a different caravan because she overheard one of the other members saying racist things about halflings - there was a reason but I've forgotten - and it broke her heart\n\nBasically, it showed really early on that playing an asexual/purely platonic character can be really annoying in this game.",

Folks like Marcoryl or Kagha who want to close off a shelter and won't defend travellers don't sit right with him (which is part of the reason why I'll make him a Ranger/Druid in my follow-up playthrough)",
