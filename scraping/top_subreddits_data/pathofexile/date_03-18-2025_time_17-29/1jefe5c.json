And I full clear the map before I loot. And even then, my Deli doesn't run out, no matter how long I spend in the map looting. I even went afk once inside to check and did my laundry just to come back like 15 minutes later to a still active Deli Mirror.",

Are you running the idol set up where theres 26 total harbingers?\n\n If so my thought is maybe there is a harbinger or 2 that are supposed to be spawned, but got forced outside of the map because of limited space where they were supposed to spawn and that is somehow fucking with the deli meter for some reason. I know others have had issues running the 26 harby bosses on smaller maps where it can't spawn all 26 in the map, so a few of the idols are wasted space with those maps tile-set.  I would think that dunes is big enough and open enough that wouldn't be an issue though \ud83e\udd14",
