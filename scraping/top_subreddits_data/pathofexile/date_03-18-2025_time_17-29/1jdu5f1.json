                                    "body": "Before even starting, I try to have a character concept in mind, usually with a primary skill, and I pick a character and ascendancy that fits that most. Then I get to building.\n\nI generally start by picking all of the attribute nodes on the third of the tree the character occupies. That way I don't have to worry about figuring out how to path to things right away. \n\nThen, I slowly tick off things I need one at a time. Mana and Life Leech, Mana Reservation Efficiency, At least 75% Crit for most builds (Add improved critical strikes support to get there), Defenses (Armour, ES and/or Evasion first, then Block or spell suppression if you can), At least 100% life increase (But more is better), and damage (Resistance pen, Damage and attack/cast speed, Relevant ailments, mechanics like rage, etc.). I try to prioritize nodes where several things I need are in the same area.\n\n  \nAfter that's done, I cleave off all of the attribute nodes I don't need in order to path to my nodes, usually about 50%, and finally, I slowly eliminate things I can most afford to lose until I'm below the 122/123 nodes available. That said, if you can get to 112/113 it's a good idea, because getting those last 10 levels is really hard.\n\n  \nFinally, as I actually play the character through the campaign, I make small tweaks to the build when I feel I'm low on something. Maybe some nodes are less important than I thought, or some are more important.\n\n  \nI also spend a lot of time asking questions from people who know what they're doing. This build of mine is like the 8th I've tried, and I still have a long way to go.\n\n  \nHope this helps!",
