    "selftext": "Today I decided I was done trying to make currency for my first ever mirror due to it increasing in price every 5 minutes, I then made the executive decision to liquidated my entire stash and poof 250 divines worth of cards with one click. I was feeling pretty sad and wanted to alt+f4. But I still had a crippling gambling addition and a shit ton of crops.  \n  \nI sent all crops + approximately 4.5m dust to Ngakanu and got a crazy 3 mirror shard. Filled with a sudden burst of determination and a deep desire to gamble away all my hard earned currency, I sold my mirror shards and bought myself 2 unrequited love's, doubling down on the card gambas.\n\nTook a video originally intended just for my brother, but you can watch me have a freak out over my scuffed ass mic while I go from 2 to 16 cards over here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysBphU\\_3\\_SU&ab\\_channel=AdrianVisnieski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysBphU_3_SU&ab_channel=AdrianVisnieski)\n\nTLDR:   \nStep 1. Lose everything.  \nStep 2. Win it all back???  \nStep 3. Double down??  \nStep 3. Profit???\n\n  \n",
