Duelist's early game isn't particularly worse than other classes. Upgrade your weapon, invest in maximum life, get resistance on armour and jewelry, you'll be fine. \n\n> how many attacks do they need to dodge?\n\nEleven. \n\n> why is healing so inconsistent?\n\nBecause you haven't invested in it, probably. \n\nAt low level, your main source of recovery are your life flasks, which are limited by charges. Run out, no more healing until you kill more enemies. At later levels, you can invest in specific recovery mechanics that will be more powerful and/or more reliable.",
