Once it reaches about a million in value-ish. Maybe one shipment a day. In the grand scheme is things the first strategy pays out so much more and i can't be assed to micromanage the settlement any more than i already do.",

Mirror shards are currently worth around 4,400 chaos, compared to the divine orb\u2019s ~160 so you\u2019d need to average something like 20divs per 17 million value to outdo the profit rate of targeting mirror shards. The math just doesn\u2019t work out. \n\nAs for why Riben fell, it\u2019s because although no port specializes in mirror shards, Riben fell DOES specialize in quality currency. And by a little quirk of how the shipment calculation works, quality currency cannot take the place of other currency, so you can send shipments there to maximize the possibility of mirror shards by minimizing the possibility that they get replaced with something useless. \n\nThe same is true of Ngakanu, but the average tattoo return isn\u2019t as valuable as the average rune return from Riben fell.",
