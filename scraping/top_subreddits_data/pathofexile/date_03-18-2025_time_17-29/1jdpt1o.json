I like that it's a good source of extra bubblegum currencies and tattoos/runes, and gives me something extra to do and focus on. What's y'all's opinions?",

With Tujen, the thing that's keeping you from constantly rolling him is resources, which you have to farm. With heist, you need to do the heists and potentially get the contracts too. With kingsmarch, you need to farm the ores and the gold to even have something for shipping. The time cost is purely another obstacle in your way compared to the other farming methods, but it hides that fact behind a waiting window that makes you think you actually are doing things in parallel - you are not. You are either farming ore and gold for kingsmarch or you are not. You can farm ore and gold at the same time as you do essences, just like you can do essences at the same time as farming blight, kingsmarch just has another time barrier in place that prevents you from cashing in too quickly on the ores and pumpkins, probably as balancing factor. \n\nThere's nothing mobile game-y about it *at all* unless you force it on it lol. There's also nothing forcing you to engage with the mechanic and its timings either, so all FOMO is self-inflicted. You also don't get FOMO from not leveling up your heist NPCs, do you?",

There are a lot of things about Kingsmarch that I think should go core, but the main mechanic of building out the town and real-time elements should all be deleted in my opinion.\n\nI think real-time mechanics do not belong in this game whatsoever. Every other choice of currency making is just that - a choice. You can *either* farm blight *or* farm legion, etc. The opportunity cost of choosing one is always what you could be farming *instead*. Kingsmarch is unlike that. With Kingsmarch,  you are objectively wrong for not also keeping up with Kingsmarch as well as your main grind as they happen simultaneously. Kingsmarch even continues when offline.\n\nThese types of real-time mechanics *will* promote an unhealthy playstyle in a certain portion of players. Back in settlers we got posts of people setting alarms to wake up every few hours to send a new shipment. This kind of behavior should never be rewarded by a game\u2019s design, full stop.\n\nIf it were up to me, I would:\n\n* keep gold \n* keep the currency exchange \n* keep respeccing for gold \n* keep the black market\n\n* *maybe* keep recombinators (I love recombinators but I feel like they define the crafting meta a bit too heavily. If kept, make it a hideout bench and remove the dust cost component. I wouldn't mind them going back to an itemized drop again, either, like they were in sentinel league)\n* *maybe* keep runes and runesmithing. This can also just be a hideout bench\n\nEverything else about Kingsmarch should be deleted\n\nWith town building and upkeep out of the question gold will be more sustainable for the average player, but the drop rate can always be tweaked further.\n\nGold serving as a gatekeeper on the exchange is very good design and must remain so that bots do not flip items all day, but the gold cost on mass buying small items is a bit absurd as it stands. However, with gold ONLY being used for the exchange, respeccing without regrets, and the black market, I think a proper balance can be found.",

Keeping the Black Knight as a rare map encounter in t16s and adding runes to expedition bosses, runic monsters, or even into tujen's rewards would be a great way of implementing them without keeping Kingsmarch. Hopefully they would get a dedicated spot in the expedition locker.\n\n  \nAside from that I don't like the current state of crafting with recombinators, or the mobile game elements like crops and shipments.",

The other real problem with gold and the trading system is arbitrage become so easy to automate without ever having the need to interact with real trading. As an avid abuser I can consistently turn 30-50k gold into 5-10div overnight. By week 2-3 of the league I\u2019m moving 200-300divs overnight on Faustus and averaging 30-50divs returns.

            "body": "Idk why pinnacle bosses don't have a hard coded like 10k drop of gold. They figured it out for the stupid little league bosses like pirate man or whatever. But if I'm farming maven and so on, then I get like 500 gold every 5 minutes. And T17s blow the pants off everything else, like in settlers I regularly get 100k per map (phrecia idols too expensive for me to get that setup lol).\n\nOther than that, the whole progression is way too annoying. It must cost like 500k to get everything maxed out, on top of rerolling workers and remembering to grab rares for dust. Uniques I'm fine with bc they return a good amount, but you can't dust uniques until like the final tier which requires cumulatively like 150k dust. It reminds me of old betrayal where you had to get each unveil like 6 times to level them up, or old lab hunting down 6 separate trials. Just needlessly bloated systems to slow players down so they don't enjoy the system until 4-6 weeks into league.\n\nI do like the rune bench, but it's just power creep to offer such good enchants. The harvest ones were minimal enough to just eke out that extra 1-2%dps. The runecrafting is too generically good imo. \n\nThe real niche to me is the tattoos and well rolled rares. That is something I feel is underserved by the rest of the game. I'd often see 5 *very* good rare items from iron ore shipping quotes of like 40-80k, which is awesome for ssf or just good money for players that know the economy and sort thru the good ones. It's like a much more accessible and streamlined version of rog or heist rares, and doesn't require separate gameplay mechanics to do it. Tattoos are a similar thing: in standard I very rarely see tattoos, but with settlers, I have half a tab full of them and even one or two of the rare ones like movement speed or suppression. I think tattoos add a lot to the game and I would definitely want something like settlers going core to make them as ssf accessible as cluster jewels have become. The issue is they have to rework the ores or make them like 10x more quantity so when you get them to proc on a map they equate to like half a shipment or something.\n\nRecomb is cool in theory but always gives me a headache thinking about it. I don't want to have quad tabs full of half finished bases that I'm keeping track of, like \"oh these ones are going toward X project, and these ones Y project, and they each take up 20x20 space or more\". It's just too micro manage-y for me or requires way too much trading to buy bases. Reminds me of necropolis or archnem and trying to remember every little recipe I have cooking and each recipe taking up my very finite space.",

            "body": "It all should go core, every aspect of it.  \nBut many parts of it should be rebalanced or revamped.\n\n1. **Gold:**  \nThe gold formula and acquisition of it should be re-balanced entirely.  \nGold gained should be increased as a base and the impact of explicit map modifier effect should have less effects on it. What dictates gold generation the most should be League Mechanics themselves more so than map mod effect. What should be changed is all League mechanics dropping **VASTLY** more gold as a base value, even in scoured maps. Then reduce the amplification quantity, rarity and packsize has. Gold generation should be more linear and less exponential. For example, if I'm farming Ultimatum right now in Alch and go maps I generate \\~6k gold per map if I full clear it. If I do 130% increased explicit map mod effect maps with Rarity Flask I get 75k gold per map. If you do high end Rogue Exiles farming you get like 200k per map. It's just not balanced. Instead, in these examples the Ultimatum map should probably generate around \\~20k gold, the juiced 130% increased explicit map should probably geneate around \\~50k and the Rogue Exiles should generate around \\~80k. We currently generate WAY too much gold at the top, and too little at the bottom. \n\nAlso, rarity should be completely removed from Gold generation. The pressure to run Gold Flask with Mageblood et.c. just to get more gold is extremely unfun and not good for the game. Rarity should have zero effect on Gold from gear. Having rarity affect gold drops on the map or from the Atlas is probably fine though. Also, non map related content needs to have its gold generation buffed substantially. We're talking like 1000% buffs here. Blighted Maps, Simulacrums, Delve, Heist, Sanctum et.c. should all have their own venues for generating gold as it's a central part of the game. Spending 7 minutes in a Blighed Map and getting 3k gold or 20 minutes in a Simulacrum and getting 10k s just unacceptable. In addition to buffing the base gold generated from these mechanics by several 100%, I suggest adding unique systems to each mechanic allowing you to extract more gold for doing them. In Blighed Maps for example, maybe at the end after finishing a Blighed Map, Cassia could offer you to trade a large amount of gold for a set of random oils or something like that. Niko could offer to trade Azurite for Gold et.c.\n\n2. **Shipping:**  \nShipping is a cool mechanic but the rewards need to be completely rethought and re-imagined. Especially the rewards gained from Bars/Ores. We're currently in a situation where Bars are completely useless as all they give you is a bunch of useless Rare items. Bars should have special rewards tied to them and be buffed broadly. Tattoo and Runes should be tied to Bars and not overall shipment value. Meaning if all you send is Crops, you don't get Tattoos or Runes. Different Bars should be able to target different types of rewards too, for example maybe sending Crimson Bars gives higher yield for Strength Tattoos. Verisium could increase the \"rarity\" of Tattoos increasing the chance for Journey tattoos or spell suppression tattoos et.c. Alot of things you can do here. Should probably tie some other rewards to Bars aswell other than just random rare items. One bar type could be associated with Scarabs for example, and you could have Harbor locations instead dictate the weighting for the type of Scarabs you get back allowing you target farm what you want. One Bar could be entirely Gear related allowing you to fish for well rolled rares with rarity and quality of items going up with shipement value. High shipment values of this type could maybe also be used to fish for rare uniques et.c. With ports dictating what type of Base types you're fishing for.\n\nCrops can pretty much remain the way they work right now, maybe with some changes. I'm fine with them being there to generate raw currency. Probably should change it so shipment time and distance also affects rewards in some way. Sending your 50 mil shipment to Riben Fell for 34 minutes or to some distant port for 3 hours or whatever imposing a 10% risk aswell, should not yield the same rewards.\n\n**(1/2)**",

                    "body": "3. **Mappers:**  \nI love the idea behind mappers, but I absolutely **hate** the execution and how they were implemented. This system has alot of potential to be a fun and cool mechanic in the game. I think this should be turned more into a standalone strategic mechanic in the game and less of a 'mobile game daily' used to burn maps. The initial premise for having a system to burn maps is great, we already generate more maps than we know what to do with. But having the system revolve around re-rolling for level X mappers and them randomly dying as they do your maps feels awful. I would love for them to add way more depth to the system. Give mappers classes, skill trees, gearing and a type of leveling system. Make them feel like an actual interactive part of the game. They could have their own subset of builds and 6-man strategy combos to strategize around.\n\nWhen they inside a map, instead of actually having them dying like it's hardcore, instead have the punishment be them being disabled for a couple of hours having to rest and recover. Maybe introduce a new type of Gold sink if it's required where you can build and level up a Hospital or something to take care of Mappers and increase their recovery speed or just outright use gold to instantly heal a fallen mapper.\n\nI'm just throwing random ideas here, but you get the point. It has alot of potential to be an actual fun and interesting mechanic if delved deeper into. Having alternate ways to use currency and minmax in the endgame outside of your own character has always been a fun thing to me. The idea of being able to actually gear up mappers to improve their survivability, damage and speed when they're doing their thing is cool to me.\n\n4. **Rune Forging:**  \nAgain, another really cool concept but I think there should be added depth to it. Also, the power disparity between what different archetypes get is extremely inbalanced. For example all minions get from this mechanic is 39% increased minion damage, while some builds get 100% more damage from Return projectiles. The power disparity is insane.\n\nMy first suggestion would be to expand this system beyond just applying to Weapons. Allowing you to Runesmith one piece of Armor on your gear and one piece of Jewellery with an Enchant would be a welcoming addition. I also think the list of available Enchants should be re-thought and instead of being arbitrary power that could be anything, rather be tied to unique items instead. What do I mean by this?\n\nI'm borrowing most of this idea from the Kanai's Cube mechanic in Diablo 3 and think PoE should aim for something similar. My idea is that you should be able to engrave one modifier from specific Unique items onto rare items, Weapons, one Armor piece and one jewellery. I cool way to implement the system would be to have the Smith destroy the specific unique item in the process and randomly engrave one mod from the item to your base. This system would both help as a Unique sink in the game giving them more value, while also help reviving the play-rate of more niche Unique items that don't get played. Obviously certain mods should not be transferable and a large balance pass would have to be thought through. For example 600% incrased phys on Marohi Erqi being transferable to another weapon would be stupid. And maybe having the 4 passive Flask effect on Mageblood being transferred to a rare belt making Mageblood cost 2 mirrors isn't ideal et.c. Certain broken mechanics or interactions would have to be balanced for obviously. \n\n5. **Other Systems:**  \nFor the other systems in Kingsmarch I'd not do too much. I think Farmers, Miners, Disenchanters, Shippers and Smelters should have an inventory system similar to Heist Rogues. Where you can gear your townfolks up with items changing or  improving what they're doing. Maybe roll for crafting bases/items for your towns people with gold in the same way you roll for workers. These items could have mods like increased resource yield, reduced gold cost, +1 to level of jobs, Job Speed et.c. You get the idea.  \n\n**(2/2)**",
