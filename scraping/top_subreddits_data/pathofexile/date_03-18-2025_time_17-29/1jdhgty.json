            "body": "Few days ago I posted the exact same craft but wasn't fully satisfied that it was on 20% base, so I decided to delete the post and do it properly on a 30% base. I ran out of upgrades on my build so decided to pour everything in the ultimate weapon.\n\n\n\nCrafting steps:\n\n1. Acquire 30% bases iLvl83+\n\n2. 3 way split using Black Morrigan\n\n3. Apply cheapest conqueror exalt and reroll to elder influence on harvest\n\n4. Alteration spam looking for any of the mods - I later used harvest reforge physical after not hitting a single T1 hybrid after 5k+ alts\n\n5. Recombine prefix with prefix\\* and suffix with suffix to make 2p and 2s rare items\n\n\t\\*When recombining T1 %increased phys and %increased phys/accuracy I made them rare and crafted multimod + exclusive modifiers to increase the odds\n\n6. Craft multimod and fill with exclusive modifiers, recombine into 2p/2s item\n\n7. Prepare another 2p rare item with the missing prefix\n\n8. Multimod the 2p and 2p/2s items, craft exclusive modifiers, recombine - in hindsight, I should've divined the prefixes at this stage but I simply forgot\n\n\ta. You win and the craft is done\n\n\tb. You end up with 2p/2s item, in which case repeat from 7.\n\n\tc. You end up with 1p/2s item, if this happens make another 2p/2s, multimod & craft exclusive mods, recombine\n\n9. Divine prefixes until you're satisfied, then prefixes cannot be changed and divine the suffixes\n\n10. Tempering orb to roll the implicit, I was going to stop at either 10% increased physical or 15% increased physical & 3 sockets.\n\n11. Socket, link, finish with crafted mod\n\n\n\nOverall cost was around 200-250 divines, of which \\~40 I've spent on bases, splits and influence, \\~20 on alts & yellow juice, \\~70 on multimods(bad RNG I think it took more attempts than it should on average), \\~40 on diving, \\~20 on white sockets(completely unnecessary but it looks nice).\n\nSomething around \\~100div I wasted on tempering orbs, I was getting very unlucky and it took almost 200 to hit one of the enchants I wanted. I  think I got incredibly unlucky with tempering orbs, it took way more than I expected to hit the enchant I wanted.\n\nThis is by far the best item I have ever made in PoE, my friends are saying I should put it up for mirror service but I doubt anyone would be interested because Earthshatter is not very popular in Phrecia and it can be crafted for less than a mirror anyway.",

It\u2019s probably not a whole lot but could be worth it if you have the extra money. Otherwise is an awesome looking axe!",

If you did that's only 1 in 3 to hit.\n\nWhat I did was make them rare(by rolling reforge phys on harvest then annuling down to 1 mod), then do the usual recomb procedure with multimod and exlusive mods. That way the chance of success goes just over 50%.",
