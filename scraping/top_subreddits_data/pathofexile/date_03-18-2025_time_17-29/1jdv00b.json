He went from 80 div to 1880 div in 12 hours, making it a 150div/hour stream.\nAll this while being hella entertaining, pricechecking(!), helping out with crafts and interacting with chat nonstop.... \n\ngoes to show you just how insane currency printing machines those crafters are.",

Maybe.\nWould more people buy crafted items if it's much easier to buy them? Very likely.\nThus I'd argue it's not likely for the prices to drop significanty for a craft.\n\nMost people just don't want to craft only and play hideout warrior.\nThey want to slay some monsters.",

So the buyers will have a bit more opportunity to buy, but the sellers increase their opportunity to sell by much more, unless they were online 12h+ a day anyway. A seller currently potentially only has 3 hours in the evening to play, only crafting their stuff and will have a hard time selling it all during these 3 hours; with offline trading, they'll have 24h to sell their stuff. A buyer has more items to choose from, but ultimately their buying time window doesn't change.\n\nCrafters also can just craft more. The only restriction from them crafting infinite items is the amount of time it takes for items to craft and the raw materials needed - and at the moment, if they can even sell it. A crafter will not want to craft more 50d items when they already have a certain amount for sale, but with offline-trading, they will likely sell more (or competition might increase). \n\nAn equalized market usually takes away the opportunity for finding bargains by searching a bit. Not completely, but a lot. This is very apparent in WoW for example with the auction house.",

I've had 20d/hr niches crater to breakeven or even smallscale loss when streaming to a smaller audience than Lance has, because the reagents I want to buy double in price and the end product drops.\n\nIt heavily depends on what you're actually crafting. Relatively cheap niche crafts are terrible to stream because they're easy to replicate and crash the market. For very expensive crafts, the number of viewers barely matters when they either don't have the currency to replicate the craft or get one craft done and then have to wait to sell before being able to craft again. In this situation, the streamer will always have the advantage because people will buy his item over the other person's to appear on stream.\n\nAlso, smaller streams tend to have a larger proportion of more hardcore players than larger streams which attract more casual players and viewers, further biasing it towards more competitors rather than more customers.",

Got them all rolled with the correct hits and mainly all t1 mods and a few with a single t2 mod that I didn't have the heart to restart with them being so close. \n\nTook the best one for myself that was like 98% perfect and tossed the other 5 up for trade at a fair price with me standing to basically just make enough profit off of each to pay for the one I put on my build, I didn't want to be greedy and ask way too much and then just sit on them indefinitely. I sold 1 of them and had a few offers that were far less than what the materials for a single roll would cost lol. It was a total loss besides getting the most badass rolled one to wear for myself.  \n\nI do like when streamers take the time to actually show how they do these crafts, it's great for somebody like me who learns visually and reading a guide just doesn't cut it with some of these crafts, but when they talk about how you can make XX div/hr by doing these crafts for profit it always makes me laugh. I know that xbox market just sucks in general compared to PC, but there is also the fact that when these streamers are doing these profit crafting sessions they also are having hundreds to thousands of people who are playing the same build as them watching the stream in real time so when the item goes up for trade there are tons of people just waiting to snipe it immediately. It's smart, and I would do the same thing if I could so I'm not knocking it, but your average dude is not going to be able to flip items the same way.",

Convenience: bulk selling, full idol sets, recombinatio crafts etc\n3. Being ahead of the curve: farming specific mechanics before they get known and the prices adjust accordingly or carrying bosses early for example\n\n\n\nAnother niche that often works great is doing the exact opposite of what other people are doing. Everyone farming scarabs, rogue exiles, harvest. Idols are extremely expensive, prices of everything that drops there crash.\n\nRogue exiles are a bit of an exception there because they are the raw amount of everything they drop is just incomparable to anything else in the game.",

Its pretty realistic to overcome the rng on osin relics if you 1) farm like a methed out tweaker for 16hrs a day (lynx titan from osrs, for example) and 2) use relic quant and a 500ms 1b dps build to spam runs.

There are external tools requiring expert user level competence, the meta and strats are consantly evolving, it demands high level knowledge of buildcrafting and crafting tricks, you need the ability to identify and corner opportunities before competition can capture them.... and ontop of that, it's extremely high investement, can yeild no returns, and in many cases high risk. You're also directly competing against time, inflation, and competing crafters... the list goes on. Thus it's also high skill.\n\nCan you make absolute bank doing it? Sure. You can make absolute bank gambling apothecaries. But the latter doesn't require anywhere near as much knowledge, skill or capital. The difference is, there's nothing a div card gambler can do to shift the odds; a crafter absolutely can in the same way a card counter is able to.\n\nThat's not to dissuade you from trying it. Just... start small. Find a build from a streamer that isn't gigantic (the huge build guides will attract more competition), that has a rare which demands more than just blocking prefixes and a veiled orb, whilst not requiring more than 6d investement / item. Blast the opening weekend to build up a character that can farm you the necessary currency, get in to your market quickly, and start looking for other opportunities as the meta develops.",

Even with relatively reliable crafts, an individual item might cost 100 divines instead of the average 20, so if you don't have those to spare and sink into it and a few more like it in order to recoup those losses, it's better to just buy.\n\nAside from recombinators which are still mostly a mystery to me (guess I shouldn't have skipped Sentinel because of no character balance adjustments), I know a lot of crafting techniques, and if I'm asked how to craft something I can often come up with a relatively efficient approach for it (not always the *most* efficient, but usually close enough). I read many of the crafting showcases (to keep learning among other reasons) and at this point I can usually follow along without needing to look up stuff.

Its quite literally an economic ecosystem, all aspects of value, restriction and demand are connected to accomodate all the transactions.\n\nCrafting needs a great deal of knowledge and some starting capital; not just knowledge of how to get the good stuff but what good stuff to get. People that are good predicting meta and PoB have a huge edge on this.\n\nFlipping can be anything between 0 and infinite profit, though realistically its not as good as people try to portrait it. Sure, you might make 5c per transaction buying low selling high but you need a massive transaction speed to bring it up with mapping. The best thing is needing nothing to start.\n\nEverything else you listed can all fall on the same category, which is specializing for content. The most profitable ones may seem really great when looking at the returns per hour but considering the return per investment, it falls apart quickly. I saw a valdo build that was worth at least 6 mirrors. I did some blueprints yesterday and got 2 helical rings, you can say I did 160 div/h. Is it sustainable? Depends a lot on meta, which heavily favours helical/simplex this leage, and how much people hate running heists. There is also a great deal of luck involved, which for many is actually the fun part.\n\nMaking mirror tier crafts to rely on Services, for example, will not help at all on the first few days. Juiced content farming actually can, just like some very boring things can always retain value simply for being boring; I always run a couple dozen shapers on a league to get some funds to invest in my builds. A build worth 2div making 10div/h is pretty awesome compared to 5000div making 100div/h. It all boils down to perspective, what you find fun and what are you farming for",

It's like everyday is an 8hr advertisement to buy their shit. Or how much easier is it to sell services like boss carries when you have a dedicated chat that can bring the request right to you without you having to fight against everyone else in TFT. Even mathil who doesn't really engage with crafting for profit will always sell off his character when he's done with it, which is almost guaranteed to be positive ROI since his videos always drive prices up for gear related to his build.\n\nNot to say all of this is nefarious, but as a streamer, it's much easier to make money when there's eyeballs on everything you're selling.",
