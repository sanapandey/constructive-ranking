    "selftext": "Congratulations to /u/sirdioz69 for wining February's contest with [their harp inspired by classical Greek statues](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1izqop8/).\n\nYou can see last month's results and entries [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1igi1oj/february_contest_musical_instruments/).\n\n## Theme\nThis month's theme will be fracture. The concept invokes images of damaged concrete, a crack running though glass, or a broken bone. But it can refer to much more abstract concepts such as a social schism, a temporal discontinuity, or an incoherent sense of self. Make something that embodies the idea of a fracture for this month's contest. \n\n## Making a Submission.\nEntries will be submissions to r/Blender that meet the following criteria:\n* The post should be made before the end of March 30th UTC\n  * [Countdown to submissions closing](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20250330T00&p0=211&msg=Submissions+Close&font=sanserif&csz=1)\n* The post should be an render, animation, or other artwork which was made primarily using Blender\n* The post should contain supporting images/text or a top-level comment with the following content:\n  * One of the following methods of proving that the artwork was made using Blender:\n    * A link to the `.blend` file for the project, ideally including external assets or links to where external assets were sourced from. \n    * A set of three image which may be clay renders, viewport renders, wireframe renders, or simply screenshots of the project open in Blender. Some variety is encouraged.\n    * A screen recording of you manipulating, navigating, or otherwise interacting with the scene.\n  * An explanation of of all work that was done outside of Blender, outside the time frame of the contest, or by other artists.\n  * (Optional) The theme you would like next month's contest to have if you win. If you do not include this, then the theme will be chosen from the runner ups.\n* Once you have submitted your post to the subreddit, leave a comment down below linking to it\n* You are also encouraged to share details of your process with the community. \n\n## Winning\nThe winner will receive the flair `Contest Winner: March 2025` and their post will be added to the subreddit's wiki under the Contest Winners list. The winner will also have the chosen theme selected for next month's contest, should they include one with their submission.\n\nWhen the contest ends, the results will be edited into this post and the 1st place winner will be congratulated in the announcement for next month's contest.\n\nThe winner will awarded $100 USD.\n",

This ends up being a low-priority kind of thing for them.\n\nFrankly, unless they're interested in turning this into some kind of monetizable content (e.g. a livestream, although none have been interested so far) or until the day that I have a personal following/online presence that they could benefit from, I'm not sure that there's a way to get consistent participation from them.",
