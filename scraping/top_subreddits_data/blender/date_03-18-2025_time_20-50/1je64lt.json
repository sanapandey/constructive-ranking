With smooth shade things will compound i think. Especially out to the outer faces the gradient may become even more abrupt. Just delete those faces and select the main edges and f to fill. You may have to work your way out then back in to that area to fix.",

However if you want to animate something, good topology allows for deformations of the mesh without creating visual artifacts in the mesh (often by having nice quads and only few triangles at tge right spots). If you want to have a 3d model in a game good topology usually means the model has all the necessary geometry it needs to look good but not any extra geometry. And while modeling assets, good topology can also reference nice edge flow so you can easily continue to expand on your model without running into any issues because of bad topology.",

If you have a large flat rectangle in the mesh, then keep it as four vertices.  In 99.999999% of the cases, this will naturally decomp into triangles by the game engine.

A gemstone inside ring that will be in a full frame closeup will need will defined edges and beveled curves. If one vertex is not following the same plane as the others, there could be noticeable anomalies. A far distant mountain can be a flat square because I don't need to show a psuedo-conical-ish shape with varying terrain features.\n\n\nA similar factor in the poly count is the texture information for each face or the UV scaling. What are the minimal pixels I need in each face.\n\n\n\nEach bone that might be used should have a fairly static object connected to it. The parts that are changing are between bones.
