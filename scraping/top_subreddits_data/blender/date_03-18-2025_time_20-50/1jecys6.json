You are basically trying to get it to project into a 3D surface with the least amount of stretching possible.\n\nOnce you have a UV Map you can start painting in the model or setting up procedural materials or a combination!",

Just use paint or Photoshop to crop a good sized square, then you can zoom the polys out in uv editor to get the size right. I'm certain this is bad practice, but I do this for fun and it can turn out pretty decent, might be easy to see repeating squares tho depending on the image you use. It's a fun thing to do just for the giggles \ud83d\ude01",
