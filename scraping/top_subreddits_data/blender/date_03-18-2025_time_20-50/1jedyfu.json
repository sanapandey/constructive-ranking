That was MANY years ago and I never touched blender again, a while back I regained my motivation to learn it and after many months of tutorials, courses and trying stuff on my own. This is my first result that I actually feel like it's a finished product that I'm happy with.\n\nNow I'm gonna move on to rigging it and hopefully try some animations.\nBut still a long way to go and more to learn.\nAlways open to some feedback if you see anything weird about it.",

I tried to fix it from the beginning, but it just resulted in that part of the hair being too high since the collar is so high\n\n\nAs for the tutorials I've used... A lot.\n\n\nWell, I got the basics from BlenderGuru.\nI watched a lot of \"modeling process\" videos from multiple youtubers. Mostly from FlyCat and Shonzo. The others, I don't remember the names right now.\n\nAnd of course, like a million random \"How to do X on Blender\" videos from different sources\n\nI always see people be opposed to buying courses since there's \"A LOT of free content to learn out there\" and that's true, but I dislike learning in bits and pieces and worse when I have to learn different pieces from different people and each person has their own workflow or uses different processes.\n\nBut I had the money at the time, and I really wanted to see a full-on project process from deleting the default cube all the way to a full animation.\n\nSo I got a Coloso course, specifically MinusT's course.\n\nAnd I don't regret it. He is really good at explaining every little thing and the WHY he does X or Y. I've learned a lot from it, and following along with his process is probably where I have learned the most.\n\n\nIs everything he shows out there for free? 100%\n\nBut like I said, I really wanted a full process from a single person, and he explains everything brilliantly.",
