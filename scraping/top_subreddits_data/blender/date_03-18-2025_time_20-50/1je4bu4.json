    "selftext": "Recently, my boyfriend helped me post my first 3D model and ask a question on this subreddit, and I received a lot of rude comments before my post was eventually deleted.\n\nPeople couldn't believe it was my first model. Of course, if you consider the default cube and its render, it wasn't technically my first model. However, this was indeed my first completed model.\n\nI took a course on creating 3D characters and spent six months ripping my ass off every day and sometimes nights to perfect it.\n\nI put my soul into this model. However, when I decided to share it with you, I was met with a wave of angry comments.\n\nI'm in the process of transitioning my career from tattooing to becoming a 3D artist. In a way, I'm flattered that some think this isn't my first model. It suggests I'm on the right path.\n\nThank you for your harsh comments \u270c\ufe0f",

            "body": "I can't see the picture but the post is still there so I read the comments. I assume this is a very good looking human model and render but under the wording it appears to be from a new blender user. I've seen people get roasted before like this. Generally what it is is someone who has a bunch of other related experience then starts using blender, picks it up quick and utilize their other tools and experience along with blender then they post here saying it's their \"first model\" without mentioning their experience. I'll admit the roast was pretty harsh but at the same time I think it is important to be honest with the community so as to shed the correct light on the experience required to make such things. Blender is one of those applications that can easily frustrate a user due to its complexity. In this example that is reflecting as a negative emotion being directed towards whatever triggered them in your post. I say just be real be honest share your specific experience and highlight those aspects to show how you got to this point in your journey. Use that to speed others along in theirs. \n\nIf this is truly your first shared model with no experience but it took 1000 hours say that and go into your work flow. If you borrowed assets even shaders say that. Don't just play it off with the words first model and end it there. There are alot of personal agendas here too like influencers, ai crap sometimes, stolen work all of that sort of contributes to the knee jerk reaction you saw there. Just keep it real and all should be good. \n\nI want to see this model now though not sure how i can see it.",

Yes. Is that a problem in the art world? No. No it's not, especially when the alternative is shitting on people who start out decent because they put in the effort. What a great way to kill discussion and shun new users who could add some much needed content to this board. \n\nMost people in real life, especially at an art school, want you to explain that you are a beginner so they can adjust their language to help you learn. This board has issues. \n\nIt's always: \"they can't be a beginner! because *I* am not a beginner and I'm not as good, they must be lying or humble bragging!\" \n\nAnd never: \"wow I wonder what their background is? I should ask so I can learn the way they did,\"\n\n\nIt's like high school art class in here, not a discussion board. It's weak.",

I am completely lost in blender despite being able to sculpt okay, I am a beginner and I would not understand any discussion about it without people getting on my level and making crayon drawings. But I COULD make a humanoid sculpt that looks nice. \n\nArtistic talents don't make people any more knowledgeable about a program, and if you look at op's model it's not anything special or particularly talented.

Most of the time, i don't think it's the best way to improve and develop your skills.  \nFor development, there are several types of professionals and YouTube channels on the internet that post the best information and tutorials for free for you to consume. I know dozens of very good 3D channels, which took a while to appear, but they are great and have the best content. If you keep learning, with time you won't need randoms on a forum to tell you the flaws in your work, you will be able to identify them yourself. They can help of course, but they won't be your main concern.\n\nI recommend \"**Beyond Blender**\". He explains step-by-step in a professional and calm way, great to listen to with music and the projects are complete and very professional results.
