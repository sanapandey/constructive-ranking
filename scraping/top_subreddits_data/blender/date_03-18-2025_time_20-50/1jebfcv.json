    "selftext": "I have used Blender for years and made a decent amount of money exclusively working in Blender. Flow winning the oscar got me hyped to finally donate. If you have ever done paid freelance work in Blender or just have the means to drop some cash I think it's a good moment to rally around Blender. I've worked in so many programs in my life and Blender is special, I REALLY hope it can stay the way it is. Of course the young people learning Blender don't need to worry about paying, and that's the beauty of the community. Us old heads got started pirating programs in the 2000s, and now thanks to Blender you don't have to. ",

My main program is After Effects, and it's my DREAM to stop paying adobe lol. Technically I could do like 80% of the things in do in AE in Blender, but for now I am still pretty much forced to work in AE due to workflow compatibility, but I do think that can change.",

So it's now basically having the time to sit down, learn and see how to do what I do now on blender.",

I don't understand it and I believe no one does aside from the people who make it.",
