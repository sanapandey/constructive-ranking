Then I walked him for the last time and at one point, he just stopped moving. We had to carry him inside. It reminded me of the times when he got away as a puppy and I had to chase after him and carry him home. \n\nWhat gets me is that he declined so fast. In early December we took him on a road trip to Florida. He was fine. Then a week after we returned, he started coughing. We didn't really think much of it for a few weeks. We laughed, we were like 'buddy, you okay?' Then we took him to the vet and they said it his lungs were not in good shape. Either it was cancer, a lot of it, or a fungal infection. But treating it like a fungal infection if it wasn't would have killed him. We put him down at the end of February. He was only four years old.",

You are generally told to give it to them as they request it.\n\nIt's kind of a wink and a nod thing. At least this is what happened with my mother. She was clearly told how much it would take to overdose as a \"warning\" while I was not, I was told that she knows how much she will need based on her pain. In hindsight I realized she had said her goodbyes in a roundabout way to us then started asking for morphine more than usual. I was scared she was getting too much and started refusing but she insisted she had been told exactly how much to take depending on her pain level and she asked me to leave it with her so she could decide for herself. I felt enormous guilt until years later I ran into her hospice nurse and just broke down telling her what happened. She said that was my mother's plan all along and that is how it went with a huge percentage of hospice patients at end of life care stages. She said my mother knew exactly what she was doing. \n\nKeeping it all under the table like that is an absolute shame. Everything about how we treat the elderly is a shame.",

She was not at all in agreement, she was still able to enjoy her life even if it was limited. Even if she only had a few hours of being fully there in the day, those few hours were worth more than any money could ever be.\n\nJust saying we shouldn't be quick to decide that death is better than more life even if the life is less than what it could be. \n\nThis kinda stuff should be at the last possible moment. A dog that can't walk can still be a happy dog, look at all the ones in doggy wheelchairs for examples. If they are still awake and aware and not in debilitating pain that can't be fixed, then it's not time yet. Even a dog that can't move can have happiness just from is owners love.\n\nI'm in constant pain from daily migraines, I've heard assholes say the same thing about me. \n\nThe idea that because something is disabled that means they can't enjoy life is just not true. \n\nVets in particular need to be more careful with how they decide this. Because there is a point where they're right and euthanizing is right. But that point comes a lot later than most seem to get. I think way too many see that the animal is terminal and act like ending it while they're still healthy is better. It's only better for the owners, not the animal. Enjoying every last second of life is what's best for the animal, even if it's extremely hard to see your beloved pet in pain in those last days, that's still going to be better than death. \n\nEuthanasia is right eventually but I feel like many times it's encouraged too early.",

We were sitting like that for many hours.I yelled to my mother a couple of times to come out of the bathroom. Nothing changed. After a while I just felt I should hold her paw. She would usually take her paw away when I did that but she couldn't move so she was just looking at me. Once again stayed like that for a while and then the life was gone from her eyes. I never expected to be able to tell a lifeless eye from the still living one but it was so obvius when it suddenly happened. Yelled for my mom. Yelled she was gone. That's when my mom would finally come out. She then called for my brother to bring our car to the house (it was winter and during snowy days we would park it in a different part of the city where we rented a garage). They wrapped the dog up and then in the middle of the night she was transfered to yet another part of the city where we had a tiny farm kind of place. I had to go back to sleep because the next day was school again. When I've got home we went to the farm and there she was. My father made a little grave for her at the gate with big rocks. My mom would plant flowers on top. It was a nice little monument for our dog.",

It's very hard to watch and I hate doing it but I would never choose the alternative of not seeing it. I always think, if it's this scary for me, just imagine the poor cat who has even less idea of what's going on. For you it's one tragic event, but for the animal it's likely the scariest part of their entire life. Every animal naturally fears death, and I'd like to think that I'm helping at least some by being there to comfort them. No creature deserves to die scared and alone, let alone someone who dedicated their life to being a perfect companion to their human. It's the least we can do for them",

He was so hopped up on pain meds and everything else when they put him down, I don't know if he was even able to register that the phone was there. I hope he was. \n\nI don't know. Even thinking about it, not being able to be there for him in that moment, I just feel hollow. I'm away at university and haven't been back since it happened, so it still doesn't feel real in some ways. I wish I could have been there for him. I wish anyone could have. But the phone was all we got, and I still don't know if that was even anything at all.\n\nI really hope it was.",

She wanted to go outside even though she could barely walk, so I let her out and followed her while she slowly ambled around. By the time she got tired and laid down in the grass, he had arrived with the meds. I helped him do the injections and she passed without even a twitch. There are some vets who will do home euth, although I'm sure they are more expensive and if it's an emergency situation you're better off taking them in instead of waiting for an appt, of course.\u00a0",

She wasn\u2019t very active, mostly spent her time napping on chairs; dogs weren\u2019t allowed on the furniture but it wasn\u2019t worth the fight to make her understand she was a dog.\n\nWe\u2019d just taken another senior pet to the vet, and there\u2019d been a suggestion that we just do them both at once; I\u2019d opposed the idea, \u201cbecause it\u2019s convenient\u201d didn\u2019t seem like a good reason to put a pet down, and she still seemed\u2026 well, not \u201cfull of life\u201d, but as lively as I\u2019d known her to be.\n\nThen there was the incident\u2026 I didn\u2019t recognize it as one at the time. It was supper time, and I\u2019d filled her dish; she came out, flopped down next to it, and started eating. I thought she was just being dramatic - \u201coh, it\u2019s been so long I almost didn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nI forget how much time passed after - weeks? Maybe a month or two? Certainly less than half a year, at any rate. Then came The Incident. This one, I clearly recognized. She\u2019d just come up the stairs, and again, she collapsed. No whimpering or whining, but she just clearly couldn\u2019t get back up again. It lasted for a while, and she just looked so scared.\n\nThat was it. The thought of that happening with nobody around, her just stuck somewhere, not able to get up and with nobody to help or comfort her, was just heartbreaking. With three of us in the house - one firmly against putting the dog down, one already committed to it, and me - I was the swing vote. When I said it was time for her to go, that settled it.\n\nI still wonder if it was the right choice. She didn\u2019t seem to be in pain, and outside of those episodes she was doing alright. How many times did she need to lie of the floor helpless and afraid before it outweighed the time she spent\u2026 well, mostly lying in a chair sleepy and content? Did I take away a life that was still, on balance, acceptable for her?\n\nI like to tell myself that it would have gotten worse, that she would probably have had another few months of increasing decline, growing steadily more miserable\u2026 but I don\u2019t know that. She might have had one episode a month for another year or two and been otherwise fine; she might have had plenty of life left to live.\n\nI still can\u2019t think about it without tearing up; even just hearing about someone else\u2019s pet dying threatens to bring the pain back up to the surface. I don\u2019t know if I could ever have another dog now, knowing that I\u2019d have the same choice in front of me again eventually.\n\nKnowing I might make the wrong choice, again.",
