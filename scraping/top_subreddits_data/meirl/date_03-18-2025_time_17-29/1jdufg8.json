You get convinced to sell energy drinks, and all you have to do is buy a $60 \"starter kit\" to kick off your new job. So you pay the money, buy the kit, and realize you have no marketing resources available and it's just you hawking single cans of sketchy energy drink.\u00a0\n\n\nBut wait! During the \"interview\" process, the guy who recruited you said that you also get 50% of the fees paid by anyone you recruit! So if you just recruit three friends then you can get out with a small profit! So you find three ~~marks~~ friends and convince them to join. Now they're in the exact same position as you, and need to find their own ~~marks~~ friends to recruit.\u00a0\n\n\nAll this time, none of the energy drinks have actually been sold to end customers. They have all just been used as a fa\u00e7ade to rope people into the marketing scheme. It's a pyramid scheme with extra steps. It's unsustainable.\u00a0",
