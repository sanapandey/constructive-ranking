            "body": "I worked in a big laundry processing facility, we used those markings to tell the difference in sizes and towel types at a quick glance without having to pick up and inspect the towel.\n\nA small hand towel would have one stripe, the medium towels would have two and the large bath sheets would have three. The texture of the markings would also help identify the type of towel, for example one of the elite range would have thicker fancier stripes going through it.\n\nNot sure if that's actually why they have them but that's how we used the markings",

But these stripes (called the 'border', even if it's not actually at the edge) lack that fluff, and can more easily and comfortably be wedged into the outer regions of your ear with a finger.\n\n\nAnd sorry if this sounds gross, but the more firm texture (and often pattern of the fabric) helps as you twist your finger to dry the nooks and crannies of your ear, but also can help scrape ear wax too.\n\n\nAnyway. Hope that helps.",

One day a friend asked her shy whe was doing that. \"That's just how my mom does it\". \n\nSo she asked her mom why she was cutting both ends of her ham when cooking it: \"that's just how *my* mother was doing it.\" \n\nSo they go to the grand mother and ask her the same question, which she answer: \"I had lots of mouth to feed so I bought big hams, and often they would not fit the bowl/pan in which I cooked them, so I cut the ends so the ham would fit\"\n\nAnd so, for now 2 generations, people were doing something totally useless out of tradition.\n\nThis story also applies to \"We've always done it this way so it's the right way\".\n\nTraditions are great to cajole our sense of nostagia and play an important social role. However it should never be a justification to explain why something is the right choice.",

Essentially, most of the towel is made up of this repeating pattern of fibers looped in and out of the main structural material. However, these fibers are small and loose. Water doesn\u2019t really stay there long in theory, but it doesn\u2019t really flow well when there isn\u2019t much to grab onto. \n\nBind the fibers tighter, and now the water has more to cling onto. A nice, thick area of fibers is great for directing water away from the main body. These Dobby borders are often the same thickness or fairly close to the border of the towel, which is also made of the more densely bundled materials.\n\nThus, water will tend to flow from the outer towel fibers, to main body of the towel towards the Dobby border, and from the Dobby border to the edge of the towel, where it can drip off more easily and dry the towel more quickly.",

But that gap messes with your warp tension, so you have to 're tension' the next towel so the weave looks right. Usually you do this with some thicker or different yarn, or sticks (i like sticks) because you can cut that part off, if you want, and hem up your towels. But when every inch of yarn is hand spun, that's a waste, so sometimes it's just done as part of the pattern. In the picture below, the first stripe of weaving before the gap is for tension purposes.\n\nBut also, weaving a plain thing is boring, so patterns make it more interesting. but complicated patterns take a long time to warp and slay. A horizontal stripe? easy as pie. So it's the easiest way to add a little decoration, and you can make the hemmed edge match.\n\nAdd those two things together, and then add like, 500 years of people going 'well that's how my grandma's towels looked' and now all the towels have them, even though they're woven on huge machines that don't need tensioning strips.\n\n... but as a crafter i see everything thru my own lens. it's probably just so hotels can tell them apart.\n\n[https://yarnsfromthelake.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/wp-1663969471450.jpg?w=750](https://yarnsfromthelake.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/wp-1663969471450.jpg?w=750)",
