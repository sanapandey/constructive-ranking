I'm not sure if you're trolling, but this type of throwing this word around willy nilly is what actual Nazis use as a shield when we try to call them out for their shit. Like when Elon just sieg heils twice on the world stage. \"Oh, you silly leftists call anybody a Nazi these days. He was just pouring his heart out to the fans, that's all.\"",

Others hope you do nothing, fail, or can be stolen from. Opposition shows us the many ways some get by with what they have inside.",
