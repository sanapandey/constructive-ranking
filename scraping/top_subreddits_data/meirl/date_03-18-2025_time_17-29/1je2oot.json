So he went over to the food bowl, got a mouthful of food, did some crompches on it, took a big gulp of water, *then went back to the peanut butter with a clean mouth to continue eating his treat*. He washed out his mouth with an abrasive and then a solvent so he could eat treats better.\n\nLast night he was scratching his ear. Then he looked up at our other dog, went over to her and started licking and bothering with her, how puppies do to senior dogs. This caused her to start licking him, *then he positioned his ear in front of her mouth so that\u2019s what she was licking*. He got his buddy to lick his itchy ear.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen a dog so clearly demonstrate such innate problem solving abilities, and so quickly. We didn\u2019t teach him any of this stuff. He just does puppy things.",

When having difficulty swallowing food: drink water to lubricate mouth and throat. When can't reach itch: initiate communal grooming since that's part of what communal grooming is for. Some dogs are just stupid and can't tell their head from their arse sure, but I've seen plenty of puppies exhibit those behaviours at an early age. In fact puppies are quite voracious learners which is why it's good to start training them young. Dogs are capable of a lot of basic problem solving pretty early on through just instinctual learning and observation. I'm not saying that means your dog isn't smart for a dog, he very well could be especially since afaik beagles are an intelligent breed, but those particular behaviours are quite common in dogs in general so I think most dogs are smarter that you seem to think.",

Can they translate those inputs into being inside a closed cage that moves? If the elevator has windows, it will be conscious about its movement.

Seeing kids figure out stuff like that is one of the great pleasures of parenting. We have a local library with a freestanding elevator starting on the main floor, with a staircase next to it. You could see both the ground floor and second floor elevator entrances. When my son realized that the stairs and elevator went to the same places, he was thrilled and amazed. His face just lit up with understanding. He spent a lot of time that day running up and down the stairs to beat me while I took the elevator. And then wanting me to go up and down the stairs while he took the elevator. I'm pretty sure that before that, he just thought of elevators as magic boxes that took you somewhere different.",

My dog can't count so he didn't know where to stop. He sees alright but his brain won't pick up the subtle cues we humans might, like a different pipe, cracked paint, wires hanging, weird stain on the floor, etc. \n\nSo the dog would climb faster than me, stop at each floor ans look at me to see if I'm going to open a door or keep climbing.\n\nHowever if I stayed long enough he would start sniffing around ang go \"oh that door is not home\" and climb up.\n\nMy point is that I dont think dogs actually smell much from what's outside the elevator because they won't be actively sniffing through the door slits, and also because there are so many people, dog and food smells inside that their brain is probably overwhelmed already.",

About a year ago I had a perfect scenario to prove it by accident. We have elevators in my apartment complex, and a grasshopper had gotten inside our building on the first floor. My dog spotted it near the elevator and went to sniff it. Knowing I could prove she did/didn't know how an elevator worked using it, I let her check it out for a second and quickly dragged her into the elevator while she was still curious. We went up to the second floor and she immediately went to that matching location desperately seeking out the grasshopper, looking totally confused and whimpering as she looked around desperately when it was \"gone\".\n\nI don't think dogs really fully understand the concept of elevators. My hypothesis is they don't really have the capacity to think about the \"difference\" in floors. They just know that they go into a \"room\" and come out and go about their business without really comparing the differences. They don't really notice. I'd give them the same odds of noticing the difference between an ace of spades and an ace of clubs based on looks. The appearance is too similar.",

All species communicate. Just because they dont use language in the same way we do doesnt mean they dont communicate with each other *and us.* Thats why we can do it in the first place, cause it developed over time with every generation bit by bit.\n\nBirds for example have greater problem solving per brain mass then primates (which includes humans). Corvidae *play* and trick each other and other species, remember *and* can cummunicate faces to others. Crows who have never met you will attack/avoid you if they learned from other crows that you are a danger.\n\nCows have best friends and get depressed if seperated, many species have an intricate social behaviour, including with humans (think of your pets).\n\nHumans are just high on superiority complex.",

For example, humans tend to get bored with the same environment day after day, but many animals (like cats) prefer to get enrichment within their environment but not for the environment itself to change. Environment changes can stress out a lot of cats. There aren't many house cats that would enjoy a random trip to the beach. \n\nAnyway, my point is not to disagree, it's just to clarify that while we should treat animals as thinking beings, we shouldn't assume that they would react the same way a human would.",
