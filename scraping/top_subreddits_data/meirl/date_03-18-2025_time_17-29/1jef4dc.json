I'm better than them! Only the toughest make it to the top! \n  \nIf you don't find a way to feel better than other people, that means your life just sucks. You start attributing those long hours to masculinity and ambition and a bunch of other righteous attributes.    \n  \nOnce I came to terms with reality (I enjoy free time) and lost that mindset, I found I could no longer compete with many of my peers. I lost my edge. I wasn't willing to make the sacrifices anymore for advancement. My corporate ladder climbing career was over. Then, every second surrounded by those people became a drain on my happiness. They felt like energy vampires, creating this standard of sacrifice I'd have to at the very least *pretend* to abide by.   \n  \nI quit corporate sales within 6 months of realizing the truth about work-life balance.

Others might prefer a 40 hour week and focus on learning or personal growth. The real issue is whether the system allows people to make those choices without being exploited or undervalued.
