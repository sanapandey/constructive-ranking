Even got pics of both couples sleeping/napping, one couple crammed in a laz-e-boy chair and the other on the couch.\n\nOutside the box looking in as young and absolutely stupid I was. My thoughts were simply, they felt calm/peaceful when they were together.\n\nThen I would be a total piece of !@%# and wake them. \"This movie/show sucks, I'm changing it.
