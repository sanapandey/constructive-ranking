I try to get out what I'm thinking, but in the middle of talking I realize what I'm saying is incorrect or I think of another thing I need to say.\n\nIt results in a kind of halting disjointed speaking pattern that feels like there's a train crash with cars piling up in my mouth and I'll never be able to get them all out.\n\nIt doesn't *always* happen, there are times when I'm completely comfortable with a topic and can speak very eloquently and calmly about it, but this is more rare. Most of the time I leave a work meeting feeling like \"Jesus Christ I sounded like a moron\".",
