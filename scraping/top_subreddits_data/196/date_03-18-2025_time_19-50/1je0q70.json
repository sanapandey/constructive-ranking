I trust you and I'll tell you if it's ever too much' \n\nOver time, her tastes changed, she's more praise oriented, less masochistic. Once again, communication is everything.\n\nI consider myself a pleasure dom and not a sadist, so I don't necessarily get off on inflicting pain, but rather successfully pushing buttons, and giving my pups what they crave. I'm happy that I was able to give her what she wanted when it was more intense, I'm just as happy to give her a softer side now.",

Like, I dunno, \"normal\" Christian couples where the Bible is used to beat wives into commodities instead of people.\n\n\nBut yeah go for the people who are hyperfocused on continuous, enthusiastic consent.",

Plus the added taboo of it being a \u201cforbidden relationship\u201d without it necessarily being a difference in power dynamic, or straight up sexualizing a parent relationship as a way to work through abusive parent trauma.\n\nIdk, kinks are weird and I think there\u2019s a huge difference between fantasizing about something and actually engaging in a sexual act with social consequences. People often use fiction and fantasy to work through dark, weird, and taboo thoughts, that\u2019s pretty normal.\n\nAnd in terms of actual incest, humans have been fucking their cousins since the dawn of time; it\u2019s less of a problem when you don\u2019t have the social dynamics of a nuclear family baked into the way everyone socializes from birth. However, that dynamic also makes pretty much any actual cases of incest between close family members pretty universally abusive. You can\u2019t escape the dynamics of a family hierarchy unless you were literally raised outside the concept of family structures entirely, and that\u2019s not how any society functions right now.",

Because of the taboo, incestuous partners will tend to keep their relationship secret. If the relationship is going well, why risk it by telling an outsider when they might rat you out and ruin it?\n\nBut if the relationship goes south, it might go public for a variety of reasons. One side accusing the other of abuse, both ex-partners venting to their friends/loved ones about the whole ordeal now that it's behind them, etc. I think there's a lot of potential for sampling bias here.\n\nSo while I agree that incestuous relationships are several orders of magnitude more *likely* to cause trauma, I think it's disingenuous to say that it *inevitably* fucks you up. Even just a cursory google search will give you a bunch of interviews with (anonymous) incestuous couples who insist they are handling it just fine. So clearly using the word \"invariably\" here isn't entirely apt.",

The vast vast majority of the time it's a parent or older relative/sibling grooming or preying on someone younger, typically a minor, and for most people, incest is something traumatic.",

Now, there are potential problems with consensual killing, coercion and such, you can also make arguments that it normalizes certain behaviors which could be a negative on larger scale, but that's a different matter (that's hard to measure objectively though). None of that is because \"killing is bad\" though.\n\nI would probably say if someone decided they want to die, and they had someone kill them, and there was evidence that it was 100% consensual, I would say the killer should not be charged.

The horror and the violence is often the point of of the movie, it\u2019s why people go to them. Additionally, it involves people willingly putting themselves in situations where they know they will be frightened, with the comfort of knowing that it\u2019s not real and could stop any time they want by leaving the theater. \n\nA rape fetish (practiced between fully consenting and trusting adults who have communicated properly beforehand) is similar. They get to explore the thoughts, feelings, and emotions of a situation that resembles sexual assault without actually hurting anyone or being hurt. Maybe one partner gets sexual gratification of having power over someone, and the other finds something arousing about being violated. Kink has often been about exploring the taboo in sexual contexts, and SA is one such context.\n\nAdditionally, there are some people that may find the whole thing cathartic of exploring their past traumas in a safe environment. I have read stories online of SA survivors who have been able to reclaim their sexuality by safely re-enacting the scenario with a partner that they trust.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to like it or want anything similar for your own partner, and I think it\u2019s perfectly normal to have some revulsion to the concept. The thing that makes kink kinky is that it\u2019s generally seen as taboo or perverse. But to have such a fetish and to want to explore it in safe, consenting environments is something that, as you said, harms no one.",
