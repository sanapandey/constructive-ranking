While apocalypticism is a really big deal in Christianity, after all it started as an apocalyptic movement in Judaism, it isn't that important in Islam.  \n  \n It has become more important to radical jihadist cults though. ISIS for example was so brutal because they were convinced that they were fighting at the end of the world, and a lot of their actions were them fulfilling their interpretation of various apocalyptic prophesies in Islam. Ironically, based on how much Hebrew and Syriac vocab is in those prophesies, we know that those were inherited from Apocalyptic branches of Judaism and Christianity, likely from early converts from those religions.",

This is based on following Jesus because of the virtues of his teaching as well as Jesus being the son of God. Think of lines such as comparing the rich man getting into heaven to threading a camel through a needle. The point is that it is possible with a lot of good works but the bad stuff necessary to get rich makes it nearly impossible. So the rich man just believing and having faith isn\u2019t enough. To a catholic God the father, son, and Holy Spirit are equal parts of God. Jesus\u2019s teachings dare good because God in all parts must necessarily push good. It\u2019s not good because it\u2019s god, rather God must be good and thus only espouses good. Kind of annoying to wrap your head around but that\u2019s the very basic idea of it. \n\nMeanwhile, some Protestant religions, and in particular some of the more popular evangelical ones in the USA preach that good works are good but don\u2019t matter to get into heaven. \u201cThrough faith alone\u201d does one get into heaven, as it is said. Such religions often emphasize that Jesus\u2019s teachings are a good way to try to live your life but that Jesus\u2019s authority first and foremost comes from being the son of God, God the father is more than God the son and God the Holy Spirit. If Jesus came down to earth and said \u201cget that bag yolo,\u201d the argument goes that we would listen to that message instead, because he is the son of God and thus his message is gospel no matter what it is. To a catholic, Jesus simply would never say that because he can only espouse good teachings else he wouldn\u2019t be the Son of God.\n\nOf course not all Protestant religions and even not all Catholics apply here, but this is a pattern in the break between the two sides of Christianity.",

(Faith refers to belief in Christ as Savior, and works refers to good actions) A lot of religious people will claim that one can be saved through works alone, though AFAIK this is actually generally unaccepted in Scripture.\n\nIt really depends though, and there are a LOT of arguments about this. I've heard the claim that righteous non Christians would show up at the pearly gates and be offered a chance to accept Christ, and only if they deny them would they be sent to purgatory. I've also heard claims that righteous nonbelievers would simply get into heaven. It's a hotly debated argument, especially when we get into ideas of people who were never given a chance to accept Christ in life (i.e. someone who lived on a random island or some shit). \n\nContext: I was raised Roman catholic, I didn't do full on Sunday school but folks of my ethnicity are expected to attend a sort of Sunday school for a few months before confirmation, which I did. I'm not religious any more, but I think it's interesting nonetheless.",

While the Bible is pretty clear that Christians should try to do good and live sinless lives, ultimately it says that the actions of people on earth can't save them.
