The dodgers\u2019 tv deal is literally 8bil over 25yrs. \n\nThe next cba has rumblings of a salary floor and salary ceiling but I think it\u2019s all posturing and nothing will change. All owners like the system as is, the only people who benefit from a floor are the non-star players. All the star players know a floor comes with a ceiling that caps their earnings and the union leadership is overwhelmingly represented by veteran players. The players were at each other\u2019s throats over the *prospect* of giving up leverage to get an international draft.\n\nBut to the original point, money doesn\u2019t guarantee championships. But it does guarantee you don\u2019t suck perpetually. It guarantees that you can take on a bad contract or two and still come up okay. It guarantees that you can keep better prospects because you take on more contract money in a trade deal. The MLB is broken and the fact that the game itself is flukey and the playoffs are \u201conly\u201d 3-7 game sets is the only thing shading it as having parity.",

I knew admittedly little about NBA other than LeBron and Curry who had just faced off in the finals for the first time. When the game starts up it shows every NBA team logo, and the one that caught my eye immediately was the raptors. For two reasons: One, I love dinosaurs, so finding out a team had one as a mascot was a pleasant surprise. Secondly, I was surprised that there was a team in Canada (which shouldn't have because I knew the blue jays existed). I looked into them, and in a short amount of time fell in love. Lucky that they were pretty good at the time, though it took a few years to win a chip. I still rode with them to this day. Meanwhile, I've never been to Canada a day in my life \ud83d\ude05",
