There are additional hormones you can take that will counteract breast development (potentially completely), but will still give you the soft skin, slowing in body hair growth, and fat redistribution. Do not let your own preconceived notions of what it means to be male stop you from furthering your personal happiness.",

I know a lot of more feminine-coded men dread getting older and looking more masculine (ie the whole twinkdeath concept), hell I struggle with it myself, but its important to remember your self-identity isn't dependent on looking 20 for the rest of your life.  A 70 year old who expresses themselves is just as valid as a young person.\n\nAt least from what I've seen, a lot of feminine men fear growing old more than anything else because of what that can entail (more masculine build, male pattern baldness, more facial hair growth etc) and feel like their femininity has an expiration date, which is simply untrue, femininity comes from within & a lot of these fears stem from society at large associating femininity with youth which is overtly misogynistic of course and needs to change.\n\nThat all said, both options are equally valid.  Only you can determine which is best for yourself, but you don't ever have to fit into a beauty standard to be valid.",
