As always, moderator discretion applies since not *everything* reported actually falls within that circle of awful behavior.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/196) if you have any questions or concerns.*",
