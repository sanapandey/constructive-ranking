            "body": "\u201cThe appearance of this man was, to put it briefly, unlike that of any other man whether Greek or barbarian seen in those days on Roman soil. The sight of him inspired admiration, the mention of his name terror. I will describe in detail the barbarian's characteristics. His stature was such that he towered almost a full cubit over the tallest men. He was slender of waist and flanks, with broad shoulders and chest, strong in the arms; overall he was neither too slender, nor too heavily built and fleshy, but perfectly proportioned - one might say that he conformed to the ideal of Polyklitos. His hands were large, he had a good firm stance, and his neck and back were compact. If to the astute and meticulous observer he appeared to stoop slightly, that was not caused by any weakness of the vertebrae of the lower spine, but presumably there was some malformation there from birth. The skin all over his body was very pale, except for his face which was pale but with some colour to it too. His hair was light-colored and did not go down to his shoulders as it does with other barbarians; in fact, the man had no great predilection for long hair, but cut his short, to the ears. Whether his beard was red or of any other color I cannot say, for the razor had passed over it closely, leaving his chin smoother than any marble. However, it seemed that it would have been red. His eyes were light-blue and gave some hint of the man's spirit and dignity. He breathed freely through nostrils that were broad, worthy of his chest and a fine outlet for the breath that came in gusts from his lungs.\" \n\n  \n\\- Byzantine princess Anna Komnene describing Prince Bohemond of Taranto (one of the key figures in the First Crusade), roughly 1148.",

With day maybe will come more? Here\u2019s hoping. Anyways, I wasn\u2019t expecting to change the unchanging minds of this place. I\u2019ve learned that ain\u2019t happening, so why not have some fun with it? Not like people care enough to let it hurt them. Effectively harmless.\n\nAs for the question\u2026\n\nI generally believe the artist should hold control for derived work so long as that derived work is not made in a way that actually says something. Though even in that case, certain methods should be able to be set off-limits if they are gratuitous (e.g. sexualization in an uncharacteristic and graphic manner).\n\nParodying the themes of a work is different than making all the characters screw because a fanfiction author/artist was horny (or worse, paid to, as that involves profiting off another\u2019s ideas). A story about trauma from rape is different to rape porn. One is about the terrible nature of a tragedy, the other is because people want to see a tragedy for their own enjoyment.\n\nI can give a pass to derived work in the case that the creator is a genuinely detestable person. See r/StoneTossingJuice as an example, where the leftist strawman and the MAGA hat character have been getting shipped like mad. Normally I dislike this kind of stuff, but StoneToss is a Nazi so it\u2019s for a good cause.\n\nHow this would be governed legally would be tricky, especially that exception case. I can\u2019t say I have a precise rulebook, only a set of ideals. I\u2019m hardly the only person with their views in such a form. I\u2019m for mass computerization in general (including economic, so you can add socialist ideals (*ideals*) to the list of fringe things I am), so an automatic cease and desist/DMCA-equivalent system to take offending content down, since as mentioned trying to do this manually, even when within legal right, is like facing a horny Hydra that hates your happiness. False flags would be tricky, but I\u2019m banking on improvements in AI making this work, once more important things like actual child pornography and whatnot have been wiped similarly.\n\nThinking where I\u2019d hypothetically draw the line if this issue was towards my own stuff\u2026\n\nRomantically shipping two AroAce characters in a clean manner to poke fun at the fact that basically all my major characters are asexual would make me uncomfortable, but I\u2019d be able to live with it. Adding a sexual component (*especially* where it couldn\u2019t even biologically work), even worse explicit sexual content, would be too far. Graphically crushing a character underneath a giant rock would be unallowable (it says nothing except carnage for carnage\u2019s sake), but looking at how other characters might react to such a violent death (so long as the event itself was not dwelled on to an excessive extent) would be okay.\n\nMind that the difference here between gore/rape and smut is that the former is considered bad by well-adjusted people, while the latter is widely considered \u00a0good.",

Neither of them is the problem.\n\nThe problem is when all of the mainstream stuff has one dimensional characters of one gender alongside fully developed characters of the other. Especially in 20th century cinema, it would be incredibly common to have a fully male cast for the story, and one girl to be the main character's girlfriend, and more often than not she only existed to acknowledge and reward the main character for completing his arc, and for him to prove himself by rescuing her.\n\nIt's toxic when it's everywhere, because it becomes the default role model for women and girls. They don't get to be Batman, they have to imagine being Catwoman to be a part of the action. So, we have a push these days to do more to make sure Wonder Woman is on the table, too, and all of that, in mainstream culture.\n\nBut some people do take it too far, and get offended every time there's a sexualized character in any media, instead of just wanting to make sure there's enough fully realized characters to go around.",

In other nerdy hobbies like /r/comicbooks or /r/rpg it seems to me that sexualization diminished in general, but definitely not that sexualization for women is being favored over sexualization for men. Meanwhile /r/Games has no lack of sexualization, and I'd say it's still more leaning towards appealing to men.\n\nThe only side of nerd fandom that seems to favor sexualization for women over for men is the fanfiction scene, but that's not a new thing.

No one has a problem with describing a woman's tits in a horny novel about a steamy affair with a sexy woman. The problem was that female objectification, as a trope, was and largely still is present where it doesn't make sense.\n\nMale writers would describe a woman's tits and hips even in a scene that *isn't* trying to be sexy. Even when it doesn't narratively or emotionally make sense to try to elicit arousal in the moment. Even when the woman is seen through the eye of someone who isn't attracted to her, even when she isn't going to be anyone's sexy affair or love interest. And it was rare for a woman to not just be a sexy affair or love interest, which was also part of the problem.\n\nAnd no, men do not, and never have, gotten the same treatment. They're sexualized when that's the point, obviously. But they aren't sexualized by default. Even in books written by female writers. There was and to a lesser extent still is an unconscious assumption in fiction that a when a woman is being described in a novel, the tone and purpose of the scene is to be sexy purely because that's a woman. *That* is what female objectification is.\n\nAnd of course there are exceptions. Of course there are bad book written by untalented women that sexualize men for no reason. But the point of media analysis is to analyze broad and recurring tropes in media, not to dig out niche examples of bad writting and laugh at the bad writing.",

Usually men don't want romance dramas where the conflict comes from the romance, they want novels where there's both a conflict and a romantic thread that's strong enough the conflict can't break it.\n\nHowever, in the exceptions, fantasy or scifi novels with romance aimed at women will be marketed more as romance, while romance aimed at men will be marketed to a general audience. You'll rarely see a guy sold books aimed at women with a female lead and romance plot even with worldbuilding about dragon warfare, so they don't end up complaining about the ebony haired brooding soldiers, but you'll still see women pick up fanservice-heavy harem manga anyway.",

Like, if two characters are banging away just cos, I'm going to roll my eyes, but it's using words like 'useless' that strike me as odd, because would you describe any other parts of a book that way? I don't think I've ever read a bit of extraneous dialogue and thought 'well, that was useless' \n\nUnfortunately when it comes to heteronormativity, it's 'the norm' for a reason, because romantic and sexual desire is an important part of most people's lives (and I'd definitely say that isn't just a 'hetero' thing), so it's natural that it comes up a lot in books. It's unfortunate for yourself, but it's kinda just how it's always going to be",

Or read exposition that's completely useless cause it's not even used later\n\nExposition is one we often point out how grating it is; usually because it's given at a bad time for the audience to absorb any of it. Or cover so many aspects you feel surrounded in red herrings (making it useless)\n\nAction is common abd tho it can be written for its own enjoyment, there's definitely useless action that seems forced.\n\n\"Filler\" is the word we'd use for a lot of these; but for \"random sex appeal\" it's usually mid-sentence and constant. So maybe \"padding\" is a better word. \n\nYou could also call a lot of this \"badly done\" or \"forced\". But I can see \"useless\" \u2014 since often it feels the author is throwing it in more as \"fanservice\" or because they feel they have to, than any thought towards the overall story.",
