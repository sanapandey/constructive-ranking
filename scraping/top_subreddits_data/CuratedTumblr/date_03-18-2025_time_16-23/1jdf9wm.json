That it should be defined by its Jewishness? That it is a \"legitimate state\", whatever the fuck that means? Or is it simply a vessel to mean that any sympathy towards the suffering of Jewish and Israeli people is aligning yourself with an enemy? Because, you know, I have heard it being used to mean every single one of those things at some point or another. I mean, sure, you might have a formal meaning tucked away somewhere, but if nobody takes it to mean anything, why does it matter? It's better to just talk about practical questions that are on the table right now imo. Israel killing and terrorizing civilians: bad. Israeli settlements and expansions in the west bank: also bad. Protesting against either of the above or trying to send money to prevent them from occurring: good. Hamas killing and terrorizing civilians: also bad, although significantly less common, but still bad. I don't want to get carried in this again.",

There's a reason why even Western anti-Zionists \n\n* Chant about Palestine being \"from the river to the sea\" - the area where Israel currently is. If not simply \"we don't want a two state, we want all of 48\". \n\n* Keep obsessing over Israel's foundation in 1948, over how it's a \"settler colony\", formed by \"European invaders\". And not in a vague historical sense, the way they're upset about the foundation of the New World colonies, but as an argument it's a fundamentally illegitimate state, a cancerous tumor in the body of the Middle East, that must be \"decolonized\" as soon a possible.\n\n* Support organizations and countries that absolutely want Israel to be destroyed, in a very literal sense, like the Houthis or Hamas. While ostracizing even the most pro-peace, pro-Palestinian movements within Israel, because they don't want Israel destroyed. See the recent BDS movement's denouncement of the Israeli-Palestinian peace movement Standing Together.\n\n* Generally openly admit they want Israel gone, and that this is the point of the movement. The entire \"anti-Zionism doesn't literally mean being against Zionism\" line is something they used to fool the less-extreme Western leftists, and it's been largely put to rest after Oct. 7th.\n\nIn the Muslim world, where most anti-Zionists live, and it's is by far the mainstream opinion, they never tried to lie about this in the first place. Zionism is the idea Israel should exist. Anti-Zionism is the idea it shouldn't exist. End of story. \n\nWhat you're describing is liberal Zionism, at most post-Zionism. No, that's not what anti-Zionism is, in both theory and practice.\n\nZionism is not, and has never been \"supporting Israel\" in the sense you support Israeli policies. Zionists have a laundry list of complaints about the Israeli government. It just means supporting its existence as a state.",

Illegal Israeli settlers live under civil law, which gives the illegal settlers more legal protections than Palestinians in their own land, and finally, of course, any Palestinians, Area A, B, or C, can be detained with any order or charge, for an infinite duration, without trial or judgement. \"Administrative detention\", which also often leads to collective punishment of the victims family\n\n4)\nJewish Israelis can marry and bring anyone in the world they want to israelo.

Yeah because when the state was established 80 years ago they needed to establish a bureaucracy to oversee land distribution. Anyone can own land now.\n\nThis is a nothing burger, of course it needed a system to control land, but that's not the point. The point is that the JNF's original goal, it's reason for existing is to secure land for Jews (and only Jews) and to prevent it from being sold back to non-jews. This also has an effect on the ILA, who has had similar policies until 2007 when it started getting contested. *Yes*, now the ILA does allow Palestinians to rent (never BUY and OWN land, just rent), in practice, it's the same as it has always been.\n\nhttps://www.972mag.com/jnf-germany-palestinians-forests/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\n\n>The west bank is under military control because when Jordan ceded the land after losing the war, (forget which one) they refused to evacuate anyone . Israel does not grant them citizenship because it would make Israeli democracy majority Muslim and a theocratic hell overnight. \n\nYou're ridiculous. Israel doesn't control the entirety of the West Bank, Israel has *Civil* and *military* control over Area C, which has 500,000 Palestinians. That's half a million people that cannot vote yet live under Israeli jurisdiction in every way, shape and form. They cannot vote, they cannot be politically active, and they are under constant threat. Israel also controls Area B militarily, which is also shameful. West Bank is Palestine, no matter what you say. And these 500,000 people will not \"overthrow and take over\", because that still leaves them as a minority in the country. Even if Israel took over the entirety of the West Bank, Arabs would still be a minority.\n\n\n\n>Israel has offered 2 state solution for decades. Muslims refuse.\n\nBeing given a smidget of your land back is not some sort of compromise, it's taunting and was handed over with a shit eating grin to Palestine, but I won't get into it since that's a whole ordeal on its own\n\n>But anyone can get married over zoom , and they will honor marriages from other countries\n\nAre you even listening to yourself. This is horrible. Marrying via zoom? Also, enormous amounts of Palestinians cannot leave Palestine, which obviously wouldn't function and would have to go through the Israeli legal process anyway, which takes years. Imagine that, a marriage taking years legally when normally all it takes is a couple afternoons.\n\n\n>Any citizen of Israel can run for office. There are currently 11 muslim member of knesset out of 120 members, which lines up pretty well with population distribution.\n\nThis is so ignorant it's not even funny. The Israeli court literally decided that Jewish identity (not Israeli, Jewish) is more important than its Palestinian citizens, and only Jewish Israelis can exercise self determination. Do you think they'd ever take Palestinian (Not \"Arab\" or \"Muslim\", Palestinian) members opinions seriously regarding anything to do with Gaza or West bank? No, and they don't. I've even said this in my original comment, Palestinian Israelis cannot form pro Palestine parties, and they are under heavy scrutiny and have a history of being unfairly taken down and crushed\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law:_Israel_as_the_Nation-State_of_the_Jewish_People?utm_source=chatgpt.com",

On the one hand wanting a nation of your own after centuries of pogroms and the Holocaust is understandable. The problem is that other people were already living there first. \n\nPurity testing a muslim by asking their opinion on 9/11 would get a straight answer. Asking a Jewish person \"Do you support Israel?\" could yield a less convincing one. A response of \"I want Israel to still exist but I do feel a bit bad about the treatment of Palestinians - but we have to get Hamas for Israel to be safe\" isn't exactly going to inspire confidence. \n\nThe seeming lack of response of prominant Jewish critics (who in theory shouldn't be able to be accused of anti-Semitism) seems to vindicate the Israeli stance that anti-Zionism IS antisemitism. Credit to Rosensaft for being an outspoken - but his words are being denied reach. Sanders continued feet-shuffling has honestly been really frustrating when he is likely best positioned to offer wide reaching words of condemnation.",

Maybe bringing up groups that also suffered greatly from genocide (and still do) isn't in great taste here.

Jerusalem also has great significance in Jewish culture. But as history came a lot of muslims also settled in the region and it has been a region of many cultures for centuries. \n\nWishing either group out of the region is a call for genocide. \n\nSadly one of the groups is represented by right wing nationalists and the other is represented by right wing extremists. One group has magnitudes more power than the other. Under one of the governments, people can largely live free, regardless of ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. Under the other, people are oppressed and radicalised from a young age. \n\nIf Palestine has a different government, peace would be much easier to achieve. If they laid down their weapons they could rebuild, they would get aid and the international community would protect them from losing their land. \n\nIf Israel changed course, they would stop a lot of suffering in an instant. But it wouldn't make Palestine \"free\" as long as it's reigned by religious extremists. It wouldn't stop the war, as long as Hamas calls for genocide openly. It would only postpone it.

While in religious practice Jewish people are actually protected and considered \u201cpeople of the book\u201d they also have a complicated history as \u201cJews\u201d is also used to describe a group that was politically against early Muslims. Flash forward to today and Israel has taken up that political mantle. The translation is murky as there is separate meaning for Jews as a religious people and Jews of a political threat. But if you zoom out, historically in Muslim lands (not saying everything was golden, but relative to let\u2019s say Catholic land) Jewish faith was allowed and protected (tax fee of course). \n\nBecause of what is seen there as European expansion and colonialism for over a century it\u2019s easy to say that Muslims in the Middle East are anti Jewish. I\u2019m not 100% sure of everything and I\u2019m far from an expert. Just an observer of my own people and I\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s more complicated than us here in the west think. Like many things, reality lives in the gray. And the powers that be, the media reporting, and everything in between would like to present it as black and white to fit their narrative.",

You cannot cross any borders that regard Gaza, for any reason other than if you're rich (99.9% aren't), nor can you leave Gaza for any reason in any way, shape or form. (You can just maybe leave if you're accepted into a university, but you will be watched, and are expected to return)\n\nThose with their birthplace marked as Gaza cannot enter Israel if they have a Palestinian passport. And those who have a second passport can only ever get 3 month long tourist visas, and nothing else. But you can go around that if you remove/get rid of your Palestinian passport and remove yourself from their registry, which makes you lose any right to the land and are basically a foreigner legally, which is ethnic cleansing btw.\n\nI'm not as well versed about the west bank, but generally speaking, Palestinians can't enter and leave Israel all willy nilly and it's all very arbitrary, nor can you do it late at night (if you visit Israel from West Bank and come back past 8 pm, you're stuck in Israel for the night, even if it's 8:02), it's incredibly strict, and it's also the reason they have one of the worlds largest border walls\n\nSo generally speaking. No, Palestinian cannot enter Israel unless it's for a short term visit or being wage slaves (literally, not metaphorically) for Israeli factories and industry",

And the word Tankie is just used as a firebrand against any leftist you disagree with, like I have seen Anarchists get called Tankies despite Anarchism being antithetical to authoritarianism.\n\n  \nI guess its just part of my bigger annoyance when people say \"This is a big problem among the left\" and they aren't talking about leftist parties in real life but breadtubers and Twitter microcelebs they disagree with.",

Everyone I know on the Left seems unable to let me be visibly Jewish in peace without making comments or (poorly) attempting to hide their discomfort around Judaism now. This isn't even anything regarding parts of Judaism that might come across as Zionist, just simply mentioning my identity seems to bring it out.\n\nJust this week I was making a lighthearted joke about the irony of being Jewish and thinking Easter decorations were cute, and my coworker immediately changed the conversation to try to talk about the latest Palestine news. I told them that doing that made me uncomfortable, and they responded with \"don't tell me what to do\".\n\n It's nothing violent or hateful, but it's made it so that every time I say something as mundane as being excited about the upcoming holiday it's met with awkward silences or some comment about what Israel is doing. There's this pervasive energy of negativity around Judaism that just takes the wind out of my sails. Everyone constantly says things like \"Judaism isn't the same thing as Israel!\" and says that Anti-Israel sentiment isn't Antisemitic, but then those same people never go on to actually examine how things they do might make Jews feel.\n\nI'm not saying this to prioritize my own feelings over the much more serious issues, so please don't respond saying something to that effect. I just think it is worthwhile to acknowledge that not all discussion around the Left and Jews is just muckraking.\n\n[Edit] Also just look at the replies in here, people all up and down this thread are saying that the comments from Jews being disappointed in the Left are astroturfing IDF agents here to sow discord.

Unless you're a gentile who lives in or adjacent to an area with a notable Jewish community, you probably don't know anything about Judaism that *isn't* the Holocaust, Hannukah, or the current Israeli/Palestine conflict. Growing up if I ever disclosed my Jewish identity (rare), I would get comments up until like age 25 that were in the same neighborhood of, \"I'm sorry about the Holocaust\" or \"did your family lose anyone in the Holocaust\" and these comments would be in response to completely mundane shit (like remarking that Rosh Hashanah was that week or something.) Yeah, the Holocaust affects the entire diaspora, but it's such an awkward microaggression to deal with when my family was impacted by the Pograms, not the Holocaust. They're usually trying to be sympathetic, because if they *aren't* trying to be a piece of shit, they know enough to know that being Jewish is *difficult in most societies*. Call it pandering if you want, they're poorly trying to relate or show empathy in a situation they know little about. It's this sort of Outsider Guilt that gets applied. This phenomenon isn't new. People don't know about the culture beyond what little pop culture media exists *about* Jewish culture, and that's pretty much Whatever Adam Sandler Did in the Early 2000s and The Holocaust. \n\nNow that Israel/Palestine is a hot topic and we have the Internet and social media, *everyone* has an opinion. They want to share that opinion, even when it isn't appropriate or they don't know what they're talking about. I'd say it's an antisemitic gesture, but I truly feel that it's not *intentionally anti-semetic*, it's a communication failure. People do this exact same posturing towards anyone Chinese in America when China starts to strongly threaten Taiwan. Anyone Chinese American will be pressed for their opinions, and people who *aren't* part of their diaspora try to insert their opinion or discuss it. I'd consider both a microaggression, but I'm hesitant to be like \"that's anti-semetic or racist against [whatever group]\" because to me there's a difference between actual antisemitism and *accidentally* using a dog whistle or anti-semetic talking point.",

I used to get very annoyed by it (I mean, I  can *still* get very annoyed by it, but the frequency is less) until I realized *I'm probably doing the same thing* to other cultures at varying degrees. Everyone should do a self audit when they run into people doing weird behaviors. It's not *all* antisemitism and racists, and we *want* more people in our (meaning minority's in general) corner. Yeah, it's exhausting having to educate--don't get me wrong. But I'd rather be exhausted trying to gently educate people who *want* the right things, than be exhausted trying to *convince* people what is and isn't Antisemitic or racist and when they need to fucking help us against a massive threat.

But Elon Musk did a Nazi salute and I have yet to meet a Jew IRL who didn't think it wasn't a salute.

Following religious practices is not like skin color or place of birth. Choosing to follow and live by the rules of any religion/ideology is a conscious decision one can AND should be held accountable for. And if the religion/ideology you choose to follow is deeply misogynic, homophob and antisemitic in it's very core, it's easy and logical to assume you are as well. \n\nI remember there was once a TOP(!) post in r/islam that basically boiled down to \"i would rather be put in a death-camp by right wingers than to be supported by dirty, unmanly f*ggots!\"",

I never said I felt entitled to anything. The only thing that anyone is entitled to is that civilians shouldn't have to go to sleep afraid. They should be able to have a home to call their own.\n\nThe turmoil in that region has been going on since biblical times, and that land had been shared by jews and Arab for a very long time. It's considered holy land to the top 3 religions, regardless of who controls the territory. Whether it's Palestine or Israel: as someone who is both Christian and Jewish, being able to see Old Jerusalem is breathtaking. We should all be allowed to cherish these things in our faith. And I mean everyone\n\nI don't stand with genocide, I don't like the Israeli governments response to October 7th because they went way too far. Hamas is still a terrorist organization, and they haven't been kind to their own people other than radicalizing some. But that doesn't give any government the right to terrorize the civilians who are just trying to live their lives\n\nThis conflict isn't black and white. It's stained red with blood from centuries of conflict. Conflict that people have spent their entire careers analyzing. There will never be an easy solution. All we can hope for one day is peace and understanding",

Instead, the discussions largely focused on Hamas and the october 7th attack.  \n\nIt makes sense, but at the same time, they all fail to see the full picture of the occupation in the West Bank. There was barely any discussion about the ongoing settler violence against Palestinians, the widespread support among Israelis for Trump, or the push by many to further control over Gaza and the West Bank. On top of that, the Israeli government\u2019s policies are often deeply discriminatory, yet these aspects rarely get the attention they deserve by them.   \n  \nIt was frustrating to hear so much concern about antisemitism while any criticism about the Israeli goverment was immediately met with deflection, \"Well, what would you do?\" rather than recognizing that the Israeli government itself is a major part of the problem.  \n\nBut thats from my experience",

If you were and are aware of what israel is truly doing in Palestine than a single incident won't change your perspective. Either the criticism was surface level or never existed in first place. \n\nLook, I know my point will come us downplaying of Oct 7 but I don't buy into this change of view bullshit. You already had that view and Oct 7 just further cemented it. Oct 7 is a convenient excuse . And honestly, I can see why Jewish people will become more pro israel after it.

They think it's the same as Christianity, something optional and not something completely tied into our identities. Most jews aren't even religious, myself included. And when I pointed out how these things are harmful and anti-semitic, not just anti-zionist, I was told that this wasn't the time to talk about it, and basically to sit down.\n\nI am also frightened at how easily the term 'zionist' has become used as a casual slur and many now assume any Jew is 'zionist until proven otherwise'. At the same time we are saying 'criticism of Israel is not inherently anti-semitic' we also need to be saying that this movement is in some cases being used as a guise for anti-semitism whether people realize it or not, and in doing so - is pushing many Jews further into the arms of Israel. I am not pro-Israel but I do understand the mindset of people who are and I think in any conflict like this, we need to work hard to understand different perspectives - going both ways.\n\nCritical thinking is at an all time low on every front.\n\nAlso I'm not saying we shouldn't fight this fight, we absolutely should - but where is this energy for every other genocide that the US has a hand in?

It could be argued that it's the morally sound choice, just as being anti-Russian or anti-US govt is considered morally sound currently.\n\nThe problem, however, that I see in a lot of leftist spaces is that Israeli *people* are getting the backlash. Obvi we know that not all Americans or Russians are to blame for their respective governments, but Israelis are not getting this same grace. Yes, it's entirely possible to have anti-Israeli govt sentiment and not be antisemitic, but it's v hard to do if the leftist in question hasn't challenged the biases they have regarding Jews and Jewish society.\n\nLeftists do not often do the work necessary to separate their biases from the political beliefs. They think that by having the morally superior position, they don't have to question their beliefs and biases surrounding the issue. There's thousands of years of antisemitic beliefs in most Western and Middle Eastern societies. That antisemitism doesn't go away just because a person with leftist beliefs doesn't think Jews deserve to be genocided.\n\nEdit: my most favorite thing about this comment is the chance to block all of the ardent racists.

So either they completely conflate the two and go full antisemitic, or I think more commonly they try to partition the two in their minds and avoid thinking too much about the Jewish faith/history's role in the modern Israeli state, which results in being more broadly uncomfortable with thinking about Judaism at all. It's a kind of avoidant antisemitism. They feel some type of way about the \"we stand with Israel\" banner hanging on the temple so just kind of avoid eye contact with the people leaving, while previously they would have smiled and nodded at the families as they walked past, giving themselves a self-congratulatory pat on the back for their magnanimous act of multiculturalism. I'm guessing a lot of Jewish local businesses have seen a reduction in non-Jewish customers, not from blatant boycott but from people just not being as excited to go out of their way to support them.\n\nAnd the Israeli narrative obviously heavily pushes the idea that the two are one and the same, and that any criticism of Israel amounts to antisemitism. They've also perpetuated the old antisemitic dual loyalty trope, that every non-Israeli Jewish national is either loyal to Israel or is betraying their people by not being so. And while this is partially a defensive rhetorical device to silence criticism,  the truth is that *Israel benefits from global antisemitism*.\n\nBibi wants to be able to turn to Israeli citizens and the global community of Jewish people and say \"See? We told you. The world is against you. Everyone is out to get you. Only via our power can you be safe.\" Israel has no incentive to hold back to protect the safety of the global jewish community, they don't care if some temple in Canada gets graffitied or someone celebrating Passover gets side-eyed, it just proves their point.",

And even in my country the news stations are trying desperately to conflate anti-israel sentiment with anti-Semitic sentiment. We are constantly bombarded with statistics that Jewish people predominantly \"support\" Israel. Its a bit of a hill to parse for those weak in humanistic conviction.\n\nBut by letting Israel hide behind Judaism's minority status is letting Israel's propaganda team win. Bibi wants this conflict in the western world similar to how cults make their followers to do dislikable things, to keep Jewish people isolated and supporting. \n\nAnd when I say anti-israel I say anti-apartheid, my area is slightly older violently stolen land, the original people are very very far from ok still. If my friends weren't here and I had money I'd think about leaving, luckily the locals, in spite of it all, still welcome us. I believe that my country, like Israel and Palestine, needs to become the original inhabitant's country legally.

Most of us Jews are Zionists in the true sense of the word, but not supportive of the right wing parties. \n\nThe actions of Palestinian supporters in America had an opposite effect then what they were going for and most of us are way more invested in Israel than we ever were before.

Jews are not collectively responsible for anything. We do not control what happens in Israel nor do we control what happens in America. Jewish collective responsibility is based on antisemitic tropes including the \u201cthe deiside,\u201d \u201cworld domination,\u201d and \u201cJewish particularism\u201d\n\n3. If antisemitism increases because of what is happening in Israel then it is because people are seeing Jews as collectively responsible for the actions of Bibi\u2019s government. Many of the antisemitic rhetoric that came out of this conflict reflected those three tropes (Jews controlling the government, Jews have dual loyalty, Jews always stick together, Jews are just trying to trick us into feeling bad for them this isn\u2019t antisemitism [trope of perfidy]\n\n4. The choice for Jews is to live in Europe or America with a certain level of antisemitism or Israel with no antisemitism but the threat of war. If the level of antisemitism rises to a dangerous level or threatens their wellbeing the choice of going to Israel becomes more important. \n\n5. The Shoah was the result of two factors violent antisemitism and no country willing to take us as refugees. Faced with the treat of antisemitism we become more invested in Israel due to the possibility of needing to leave and their core commitment to always accepting Jewish refugees.",

There is dissonance between what they believe zionism is and what it has become on the ground. I'm not talking about pre 48 zionism but about the branch of zionism that have been mainstream since the death of Rabin. There is hesitancy or just outright denial among pro israel Jewish folks that the revisionist zionism is no different from original Hamas charter, that the current mainstream zionism is just no longer having a country for Jews but actively denying Palestinian from the same right. Criticising netanyahu is just a easy way out to not admit the current reality of zionism.\n\nI'm here to have productive conversation here and as someone who is still living through post 9/11 Islamophobia, I understand what Jewish people are going through, anti-semitism is on rise on the left I agree, especially after Gaza war. But I believe one core reason for this is the inability of both sides to accept the downside of their stance. Left is frustrated with liberal Jews with their inability to expand their criticism beyond netanyahu and onto state of Israel and current zionism. While Jewish people are also rightfully angry about lefts stance of dragging everything Jewish into i/p debate and not realising this is also anti-semitism, left have growing anti-semitism problem just because their fervent opposition of israel leads them to conflate Judaism and the state of Israel. It's just like when everyone would bring terrorism after 9/11 when talking with muslims. Inability to see other side and interference from outside factors like israeli government intentionally conflating criticism of Israel as anti-semitism and Islamic fundamentalism leaking into left talking points just further increases the divide.",

Posts like this from leftists are absolutely THE problem with antisemitism right now though, because I\u2019ve certainly experienced far more of it from the left than the right lately. Elon did a Nazi salute in general, which is horrifying. Leftists have directly told people close to me that their family should \u201cgo back to Poland\u201d and called people close to me \u201coppressors\u201d and denied them free movement on college campuses for their religious and ethnic background. It\u2019s FAR more personal and pervasive than any harassment I\u2019ve ever seen from right wingers. People like you OP who bury their head in the sand about very real leftist antisemitism and thus enable it by doing nothing - as you are doing here - are allowing Republicans to make a genuine, morally justified appeal to voters by saying \u201cvote for me and I\u2019ll ensure your civil rights are protected.\u201d It\u2019s a massive own goal during a time when those are absolutely devastating.\n\nIt is absolutely infuriating how casually leftists dismiss it too. I\u2019ve heard as recently as 120 minutes ago that the antisemitic attacks at Columbia university were \u201ccompletely bogus and fabricated to destroy colleges\u201d and that \u201cother people don\u2019t get good civil rights protections, why should Jews?\u201d - from a leftist. Imagine saying \u201cthe claims of Americans being racist are absolutely bogus and fabricated to destroy the lives of business owners\u201d and \u201cJews don\u2019t get good civil rights protections, so why should blacks?\u201d That would be a take too extreme for some people I know who voted FOR DONALD TRUMP.\n\nOP, fucking check yourself. You\u2019re teetering on the edge of being an accessory to racism.\n\nEdit: OP blocked me. What a bigoted coward.",

Not as a side effect of its existence, but as the point of its existence. There is no hypothetical Israel in which that isn't a key factor. For Israel to ever stop being a genocidal monster, it needs to fundamentally change what it is as a country and stop being the \"promised land\" for Jewish people worldwide. There is no such thing as an ethnostate that has the right to exist.\n\nAdditionally, while I don't support antisemitism in the slightest, it's insane to imply that Israel is somehow making the middle east any better for Jewish people. When you're killing everyone around you in the name of Judaism, all it does is damage that image even further. It's not just that people are linking Israel to Jews because Jewish people live there, it's that Israel is painting their actions as being in the name of Judaism. That said, antisemitism is never okay and anyone equating Israel with Jewish people are either falling for Israel's propaganda or just looking for an excuse.",

To inextricably tie the violent Zionism to all of Judaism is anti-Semitic and those in the American pro-Palestinian coalitions have been crystal clear from the start that their issue is not with Jewish people at large, but specially the Israeli government & military and the US government supporting them.",

The ICC has issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, as they \"found reasonable grounds to believe\" that they \"bear criminal responsibility as civilian superiors for the war crime of intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population\", and \"bear criminal responsibility for the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare, and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts\", which given just the [starvation of civilians](https://academic.oup.com/jicj/article-abstract/17/4/781/5647317?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=true), combined with persecution based on ethnicity, is already very solid ground for a genocide. The only other explanation for using starvation as warfare is to spread fear and suffering among civilians to put pressure on your enemies, otherwise known as [terrorism](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/09/lebanon-establish-international-investigation-into-deadly-attacks-using-exploding-portable-devices/), or the [Dahiya doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahiya_doctrine). However, when you combine this with the apartheid claims, as [South Africa is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa%27s_genocide_case_against_Israel) (along with many other countries), the [historic cases of genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba), and whatever the fuck [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbPdR3E4hCk) is meant to be, it's pretty clear what's happening. \n\n\n\nThe ICJ has not gone beyond plausible genocide because any case for genocide will take years to pass. If you want to support every genocide until 5 years after it ends, go ahead. But the signs aren't looking good. Again, who do you need to tell you?",

Or did someone just rightfully criticize China?\"\n\nIn my opinion, that would be a pretty assholeish thing to say.\n\nAnd I understand your point that sometimes people really do say that things are anti-semitic when they aren't, and i understand that you just want to be polite and ask. I get where you're coming from. The issue is your tone. You phrased it accusatorily. You phrased it like you suspected they were lying to you, and I totally understand them reacting with hostility after you did that.\n\nWhat I would suggest is phrasing it more like, \"Oh, I'm sorry about that. Could you give some examples of the leftist anti-semitism you've seen? What happened?\" That way, you aren't passive-aggressively accusing them of lying, but merely asking for more information. And then if they say some shit like \"My barber said that Bibi shouldn't be re-elected\" then you know that they're full of shit. But if they say, \"My friend said that all the Jews in Israel should just be deported to their home countries\" (side note: someone fully seriously said that to me IRL), then you know that they probably aren't full of shit.\n\nInterested to hear your thoughts.",

Try reading the new testament, the views in there are literally the words of god according to them,  I wouldn't go alone in to any rooms with them if I were you given the blame which was placed firmly where they wanted it placed. It's probably why our gospels favour the Pauline tradition, rather than the Hebrew tradition, run by Jesus actual disciples, Peter and James his brother because they were Jewish and thus responsible. One more time. The early Christian church condemned Peter the founder of the Catholic church and James (his actual brother and by many traditions, very similar maybe even a twin according to some). Pauls version was preferred by the early  church as it started to form. Paul never met Jesus. Peter was his chief disciple and James was called his brother in the books we still use, although it isn;'t discussed.\n\n\n\nImagine what they say in private about the people who killed their lord if some of those things have been written and shared in these later gospels.  These are in no way reasonable people if you've never experienced someone with true disconnection from this world due to an unhealthy amount of devotion, then I'll warn you. These are not people you want to expose yourself top too much.\n\n  \nI'm just trying to give you some context that these people will know much better than me, so that you can spot signs if necessary.
