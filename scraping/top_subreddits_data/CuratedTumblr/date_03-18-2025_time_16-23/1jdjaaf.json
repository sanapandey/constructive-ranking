Replaced it with the exact same model and unfortunately the ports are going on this one too now after several years but otherwise it's happy as a clam.

If you want to buy this type of laptop then do so and if there aren\u2019t any then that\u2019s probably because there are very few people that feel like you do. Or at least very few people that are willing to spend the extra money that a fairly bespoke product would cost. \n\nPersonally I always recommend either the MacBook Air or MacBook Pro to people because Apple has managed to get incredible battery life on powerful devices that perform equally off and on battery which is such a nice thing to not have to bother with. If someone really doesn\u2019t want to buy an Apple product or a Mac in general, I always recommend a framework laptop because I really support their moral messaging. Though I\u2019ve never actually met someone who wants to carry around a 5 kilo laptop in their bag nor anyone who actually wants a CD drive so I can\u2019t really help the person in this post, but generally I try to give the best advice I can.",
