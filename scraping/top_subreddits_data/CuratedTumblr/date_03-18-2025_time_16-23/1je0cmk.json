People LOVE stories like that. People go nuts for people like the zodiac killer and jack the ripper. There's an entire genre of movies and tv shows about criminal mastermind who challenges the law and get away with anything that pulls in billions\u00a0\n\n\nThe idea that he died in the forest a bumbling moron who almost managed to get away with the crime of a generation is infinitely more boring than the idea that he survived, ditched the moment for...some reason? Then lived out the rest of his life a free man. That makes for a much better story than he almost succeeded but would up dying like a bumbling moron.\n\n\nIf anything people cling to the idea that he survived for that exact reason. Because that version of the story is cool and intriguing. It's enigmatic. It's the stuff classic films about criminals who mastermind 1 last brilliant scheme to set themselves up for life and never have to do crime again are made up.\u00a0\n\n\nBut from what we know it just doesn't seem likely.\u00a0",
