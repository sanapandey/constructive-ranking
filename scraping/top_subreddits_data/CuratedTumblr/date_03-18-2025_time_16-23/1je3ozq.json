Episcopalians, as an American church, do not recognize the British Monarch as the head of the Church like Anglicans do. Also they are much more progressive, supporting legalizing abortion and having openly LGBT clergy, including a bishop. It's made other Anglican churchs mad, and even caused a small schism in America when the hardcore bigots split off and made the ACNA (who are extra pathetic because they aren't even recognized as part of the Anglican Communion).",

I didn't hear a single homophobic thing from him ever (he was verbally abusive though, his firing was totally fair). \n\nHow ugly the splits and schizims and legal battles got at each individual church hinged on how much the leadership of those churches let homophobia take front stage..",

First, one of the English Kings (I forget who), created Anglicanism from Catholicism (mostly so he could get a divorce).

I do caution, in 2009-ish, some congregations broke away from the Episcopal Church to join the Anglican Church in North America as protest against a gay bishop, so be cautious if a church has Episcopal on its signs, or carved into it.\n\nI also find it interesting that the Episcopalians call the Pope \"the bishop of Rome\"",

To make a long story short, the Catholic Church thinks that b/c Peter effectively started the religion after Jesus dies and named his successor as the Bishop of Rome that gives the Bishop of Rome a unique position of leadership in Christianity.

I can totally believe that OOP grew up in that kind of environment. But that's just one kind of protestantism, and can't be generalized to all protestants.\n\n\nPersonally I grew up Episcopalian, which is like as close to being Catholic as you can get without being Catholic (which makes sense since one of my parents was raised Catholic). It's still protestant but it's significantly different from many other protestant sects. Meanwhile my other parent went to a Quaker high school, which is completely different again. Still protestant.
