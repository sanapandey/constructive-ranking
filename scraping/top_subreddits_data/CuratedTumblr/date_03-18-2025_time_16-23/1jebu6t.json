I just think it's more difficult for people to imagine, considering our modern day animals. Also, monsters in (western) media are often depicted as scaly and monotone AFAIK.\n\n\nThey're potentially colorful with feathers and fluff, sure, but they never lost their size, teeth or strength.\u00a0As if colorful dinosaurs with feathers can't still be intimidating...\u00a0\n\n\nAnd *what if* they became less scary (which is subjective)? That doesn't matter at all. What matters is depicting extinct animals as accurately as possible.\u00a0\n\n\nPerhaps people should stop treating them as mythological monsters, and instead start respecting them like real animals that actually existed once on our planet. Their appearances shouldn't need to be changed and twisted in order to satisfy some kind of 'scary' factor.\n\n\nIt's honestly really frustrating that people are so unwilling to accept the dinosaurs' real appearances. Children keep growing up with the wrong idea of what dinosaurs actually looked like. Many adults keep rejecting any accurate depiction. Only educational material and media will depict them accurately.\u00a0\n\n\nThis extreme resistance to change is pretty unbelievable, and all because the \"classic\" dinosaurs have become a commodity comparable to dragons and unicorns, instead of the real animals they were once.",

Direct evidence exists for several species.\n\n\nThe T-rex, for example, is only said to have had some sparse feathering, like fuzz, so not much would change on that front.\n\n\nBut we know for certain that other species *did* have feathers. And then [paleontologists did their thing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feathered_dinosaur) and speculated about any species related or descended from those dinosaurs. Is it speculation for some species? Yes. But basing dinosaurs' looks on educated modern day speculation is still more accurate than basing them on, for example, Jurassic Park.\n\n\nI'm far from an expert into which dinosaurs had feathers for sure and which didn't, but the fact remains that the common depictions of dinosaurs are not based on reality, but on outdated information and commodity. People don't want their iconic \"real life dragons\" to change, even when evidence points towards or even *proves* something else.",

Anything I post will be met with the same praise, whether I'm announcing another drop in egg prices, or playfully insulting Sleepy Joe. Then I have an idea. \n\nI open bluesky, and start scrolling. Then I see it. A lovely lady talking about the website, turn-me-into-a-girl.com . I'm intrigued, and click on it. \n\nWhile simple, it speaks to me on a level nothing ever has before. I thought the whole in my life was from Fred refusing to ever acknowledge me, but, now that I've seen this, it's more likely because I was never who I was meant to be. \n\nI order estrogen. \n\n\nLike and subscribe to my YouTube channel for part 2",

It's just that the enhanced colour is simply a lot more popular. Every once in a while, a study comes out that maps the colours even more accurately\\* to what it is in real life, and it goes viral. Off the top of my head, there was a similar study in 2016 as well as the recent one in 2023. Funnily enough, the viral 2023 paper wasn't even about Neptune, but Uranus with Neptune just included as an example.\n\nHere's an original voyager image taken in 1989 by Voyager 2 with accurate colours that was released in 1996: [https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00063](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA00063)\n\nIt's not a perfect match to our current most accurate image, but you can see that the colour is pale blue, just not as pale and teal toned as the current most accurate picture which uses colour data from the Earth based Very Large Telescope (yes that's its actual name) to translate the data from Voyager to how our eyes would perceive Neptune.\n\n^(\\*Colour isnt real and partly a social construct. It's just how our eyes perceive different wavelengths of light. Because we don't perceive different wavelengths equally or even with the same mechanisms, there is quite a bit of subjectivity when converting from light spectrum data from a camera to an image that represents our real life perception.)",

That part of the definition of a planet means that it had enough mass, when forming, to either take in or throw out all the rocks and stuff that were around it. Meaning there are no other considerably large celestial bodies (asteroids, other planets and such) in our orbit path. There's debris in orbit around Earth, sure, and small asteroids, meteors and comets and such that occasionally get flung our way, but our orbit path is clear save for us. The only thing large enough, and consistently there, to be considered junk in our orbital neighborhood, is the moon, and that doesn't count for obvious reasons.\n\nI think you might be misunderstanding what a cleared neighborhood means, if you think we don't have one. Pluto is in the Kuiper Belt, which is full of little celestial bodies just roaming around, all of them orbiting the sun at approximately the same distance from it. Most of them are significantly smaller than Pluto, but if you scaled the average Kuiper Belt asteroid to Pluto, it would be a much closer size ratio than the human debris orbiting Earth is to Earth. Also, most of the human debris is in Earth's orbit, not orbiting the sun on its own, within our orbital neighborhood. Just because there's a lot of trash in the yard, doesn't mean we're not the only house on the block, so to speak. Conversely, just because Pluto is a larger house than the others around it, doesn't mean the block isn't crowded with other, albeit smaller, houses.",

At the very least, it seems that the debris needed to disqualify a planet needs to be of a certain size and/or amount, which the earth does not currently have orbiting it. \n\nThe IAU itself gives a list of the celestial bodies in the solar system they consider planets, and the earth is included.

The largest ratio among those is the asteroid Ceres which is a third of the mass of the rest of the asteroid belt.\n\nSo they could make the criteria more specific but there's no need to at least in our solar system, because there's a huge difference between planets and dwarf planets in terms of how much of their orbit they've cleared. Planets have all cleared nearly all of their orbital region while dwarf planets are all only a fraction of the mass of their region.",

            "body": "I don't know how to say this without sounding like a jerk, but the Pluto thing in particular is actually a big issue in astronomy. The way they defined a \"planet\" in the 2006 vote is actually a super big problem. To put it in its basic terms, the new definition has three factors that constitute a planet:  \n  \nBig enough to be a ball - its gravity must pull itself into a spherical shape (This one makes sense)\n\nMust orbit the sun - and ONLY the sun. (Wow. Only eight planets in the entire UNIVERSE. We're pretty special huh? Just us and nobody else.) \n\nMust clear its orbit - \"has \"cleared the neighborhood\" around its orbit.\" (This is that apparently declassifies Pluto. And it's so infuriatingly vague.)\n\nLeading up to the 2006 vote, there was a different definition that they were going to vote on instead. It had just two quantifiers:\n\nBig enough to be a ball, and must orbit a star while not being a moon or another star. This definition makes sense. It'd include the \"exoplanets\" and with this definition, our solar system would have 12 total planets, including Pluto and some of the largest dwarf planets. But they threw it out literally the day before the vote happened, and made this new one instead that adds \"Dwarf Planets\".\n\nThe whole situation is extremely controversial and it's a lot more complicated than \"they took away my favorite planet because they're bullies\" or \"people are ignorant to science and fearful of change\".  \nI could go on and on about how there's a bunch of other factors that make the 2006 IAU vote particularly frustrating, but I'll probably do that later in an edit when I have more free time.\n\nIn short, it's not Pluto, it's the actual definition they made that sucks and should probably change. They already had one that was going to work perfectly fine and had a lot of support, but threw it out last second for no valid reason that I am currently aware of.\n\nGranted, I am biased. I do work at the observatory that discovered Pluto, but I digress. I just dislike how much misinformation there is from both sides of the Pro-Pluto and Anti-Pluto camps. Thanks for reading.",

Then when it was discovered that they were part of a belt consisting of many such objects, the use shifted from \"planet\" to \"asteroid\".\n\nIt was similar with Pluto. For a long time, it was alone out there. Then in the 90s more objects started to be found in that region. Then when one more massive than Pluto was discovered it forced the issue. Either that would need to be a planet, or Pluto would need to be reclassified.\n\nPersonally I don't get that into the controversy though. Either definition can work, as long as its used consistently. What's more important is people understanding the solar system. And it's definitely a lot more complex than 8 or 9 planets.",

To planetary scientists, dwarf planets are a subcategory of planets. When a scientist wants to distinguish that they're talking about a planet like one of our 8, they'll say \"main planet\", or more often, specify the relevant planet type, \"terrestrial planet\" or \"gas giant\". \n\nIn casual speech, sure, the term \"planet\" is exclusive of dwarf planets, but only because we're eliding the implicit \"primary\" or \"main\" that would otherwise disambiguate it.\n\nSimilar to how today in early 2025, when you see the word \"car\" you usually understand it to mean \"internal-combustion engine car\", and you specify the subtype for everything other than that: hybrid car, electric car, etc. (I think this is changing in my dialect, but it has been true for a while and still might be for most people)\n\nOr \"milk\". Nobody ever says the phrase \"cow's milk\" in normal conversation, because when you say the word \"milk\" by itself the \"cow's\" is implicit, because that's the most salient type conversation outside a specific context. For most people, you ask \"do we have milk at home\" the answer should not be \"yes\" if what we have is oat milk, soy milk, or breast milk, because those are rarer subtypes that are not what we usually mean when we use the term by itself. \n\nLikewise when you say \"planet\" you usually mean the primary planets, the ones that own major portions of space, exclusive of the special \"dwarf\" type that aren't relevant unless specifically evoked.",

Why is a third of the supposedly scientific definition defined in such vague and nonrigorous terms? Why should the planetary status of a body be determined by where it orbits at all?   It's a stupid definition that's only become more and more stupid with the explosion of discovered exoplanets, which, sorry, aren't technically planets according to the IAU because they don't orbit our sun.  \n\nIt's also just linguistically dumb.  Why do we have a bunch of words like exoplanet, rogue planet, dwarf planet, etc. that should be subsets of the broader category of planet, but they aren't for some reason?  It's needlessly confusing to the public, which was the entire reason they went with this stupid definition in the first place.  Because actual scientists didn't ask for this.  They're using the much clunkier terms \"planetary body\" or \"planetary-mass object\", terms that exist purely to describe the category that should be called a planet if the IAU had the balls to go with a definition with actual scientific utility.

The only reason Pluto is disqualified from being a planet is that there's too much stuff in its general region of space. It is a planet in every other sense of the word. By this logic, if a planet in our solar system were to enter an unstable orbit and cross the path of another, both would cease to be planets. In fact, some projections show that just this may happen to Mercury in several billion years, so why not just go ahead and erase its planet status now?\n\n2. Basically the only reason this distinction came about is because more Pluto-sized bodies were found, and people were worried that there were getting to be too many planets for people to keep track of. There are also too many animals for most people to keep track of, but you don't see anyone complaining about that, or reclassifying lesser known species as \"dwarf animals\".\n\n3. This is the one that really irks me - \"dwarf planet\" is not a subcategory of planet, it is its own thing entirely. Despite meeting every criteria but one for being a planet, Pluto is, by the IAU's definition, as far from being a planet as any random asteroid.\n\n4. The IAU definition also states that a planet must orbit the sun. Perhaps a reasonable stipulation in the early 2000s, when we were uncertain if planets beyond our solar system even existed, but we have discovered literal thousands of exoplanets by now, and directly imaged several of them. But nope! Never mind that it's the size of Jupiter, and suitably round, and there's nothing else in it's region of space, it's not orbiting *our sun*, so it's not a planet. I shouldn't have to explain why this is moronic.\n\n5. This definition was decided upon by the IAU, which stands for International Astronomical Union, an organization of astronomers. Astronomers, notably, are not planetary scientists, and are not required to be studied in things such as the formation or characteristics of planets. Why, then, do they get to be the final authority on what is or isn't a planet over, oh, I dunno, the actual planetary scientists who have spent their lives actually studying these things? This makes as much sense as a local hiking club trying to change the definition of a mountain. Or, to use a more realistic and culturally relevant example, cishet male politicians passing laws on things that don't affect them, like abortion or HRT.\n\nTL;DR: Pluto is a planet, Eris is a planet, Ceres is a planet, the IAU is a bunch of idiots.",
