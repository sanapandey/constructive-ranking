            "body": "In Tibetan Buddhism, there is the story of the sage Milarepa, who early in life has his father pass away and his extended family move into his house and start mistreating him, his siblings, and his mother. At the request of his mother, he travels to see the local teacher of dark sorcery. The teacher can only teach him a couple of evil mantras (one that kills people and one other than knocks them unconscious), so he has to refer young Milarepa to another, more qualified teacher of the black arts for further training. After completing his training Milarepa unleashes a reign of terror on his extended family and their associates, before later regretting his evil actions and converting to Buddhism to in an effort to purge his karma.\n\nSo in the framework of this story a network of black magic teachers just apparently exist and give referrals to each other.",

She would have a technique strenghtening her body and spirit to survive eating an entire monster and digesting its destructive energies (I was thinking of how large cats and especially snakes digest same meal for days, and thought that was really cool). \n\nHer madra would be like glossy black flame, warm and playful and hungry, like a black cat you didn't quite see. I thought it'd be cool if it pulled itself into kinda-creatures with a bit of their own will, as a side effect of eating demons, that'd be its special thing. One of its aspects would be hunger, because I *just* learned that Yerin has sword madra, and...okay, I have an incomprehensible nitpick grudge with magic systems dividing the world into elements and claiming that it's both objective, that the division does not change from one philosophy to another, and at the same time having very human, very specific aspects, and \"sword\" struck me as an example of that. So I picked \"hunger is an aspect\" as a thing that made sense to me as primal force, but which I wouldn't expect the writer to actually ever put in their list of objective, primal elements.\n\n(much later I have less issue with sword madra as I learned that it's more *kiki* than specifically sword, but, like, there's a gag about \"I know there's no such thing as bird aura\" like it's an absurd notion, and I take issue with certainty that objective rules of the world will be so simple as to be common sense. I think some sects having just, straight up different set of aspects could be cool)\n\nShe had a fang-lined smile from ear to ear, purely because I have a smile too wide and insert it into my OCs when I can and it fit really well here! I hadn't finished the first book so I haven't seen how you get to Gold and what it does to your body, so that was just, side effect of eating nightmare monsters I guess.\n\nIf you've read the rest of Cradle, you can imagine how deeply fucking funny it was to me. I'm on book 9 right now and I don't know if any part of my test OC *hasn't* been used yet to surprise me again, but I have thought that before.",

I also tend to worry it'll take a hard turn into \"and that's why Ukraine has always been a part of Russia and NATO is encroaching on Russian territory, and if Russia wants their territory they should just quit fighting and let it happen!\"   \n  \nor \"and that's why China's territorial claims over Taiwan, the islands in the South China Sea and northeastern India are all valid and if China wants their territory they should just let it happen!\".  \n  \n(Imperialists, imperialists everywhere, with different coats of ideological paint.. for the record, I use the countries' names to refer to the state specifically, not their people.)\n\nI believe there was a Soviet line about this line of rhetoric, \"and in America you lynch black people\". Kind of a \"you've been charged with crimes yourself, why are you calling me out?\" situation - countries are charged with crimes by the apparatus of other countries to divert attention away from their crimes, and the darker shades of grey appear brighter to people by comparison.\n\nI think I understand your point, though. If the world after this phase of turmoil will look similar to how it looked before, maybe Europe would be better off holding the \"free world\" flag - France was where the French Revolution and the ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity began blossoming, no?",
