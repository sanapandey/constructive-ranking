Then he needs to kill Gale because Gus is planning on killing him and Jesse once Gale figures out the formula. Because Jesse went to kill Gus' men and Walt saved his life. It had nothing to do with ego, that was just how he played it off to get Jesse back.\n\nAs for Walt wanting an \"acolyte\", the series is not subtle with Walt considering Jesse his son. His love for Jesse is the only reason Gus didn't have Mike murder Jesse when he tried to kill the drug dealers that killed Andrea's brother.\n\nBut, yeah, Walt is a very flawed person just like most people in the show. The show isn't exactly subtle with that either especially by the end.",

                                    "body": "Basically Platonism holds that there's a sort of abstract higher dimension inhabited by Forms, which are basically the ideal essences of all things; anything that exists in perceivable reality does so by participating in or resembling a Form, but they're at best imperfect shadows or imitations of the timeless, perfect Form. Because a perfect thing has to have the perfection of existence in a lot of philosophies, the Forms are actually more real than the things imitating them. \n\nThe allegory of the cave is a way of explaining this concept; the cave is imperfect perceivable reality, and outside the cave is the perfect and thus more real World of Forms. The shadows on the walls are everything we can perceive, which we might point to and say \"that's a bird\" because it resembles a bird; the shadow isn't an actual bird despite resembling it, just like an actual bird isn't the Form of the Bird despite resembling it, but since the people trapped in the cave can't see an actual bird, they mistakenly believe the shadow bird is the real thing. Similarly, since we can't see the Form of the Bird (although we can come close through the use of reason), we mistakenly believe an actual bird, which is only a \"bird\" because it participates in birdness, is more real than the perfect ideal bird by which birdness is defined. Leaving the cave is recognizing that perceivable reality is less real than the World of Forms, and seeking to understand said higher reality through reason; basically becoming a philosopher (on a side note, a good portion of Platonic literature is Plato jerking himself off over how much better philosophers like himself are than everyone else).",

                                    "body": "To expand on the point of the allegory, Plato believed philosophers had a civic duty to engage with society and educate people even if they'd rather live as an intellectual recluse. Once the philosopher has escaped the 'cave', Plato argued they shouldn't just relax outside in their freedom but rather head back down to teach the remaining prisoners what's outside. \n\nThe prisoners won't want to believe them, as the shadows are all they know, so it's up to the philosopher to teach them about something they've never personally experienced. Most of them will think the philisopher is mad, as their eyes now adjusted to the light will be blind in the dark of the cave, and if the philosopher tries to free them and force them outside they'd rather kill the philosopher, fearing they'll end up blind too.\n\nWhen you take it into consideration with the Socratic dialogue, you can perhaps see it as an ultimate test of whether the philosopher themselves understood what they saw outside, that they can explain their idea convincingly to someone who has never even imagined it.\n\nIt touches on a lot of other things as well, but that's clearer if you read it in the wider context of *The Republic* or just Book VII. It's a small piece of a much longer argument Socrates/Plato makes on the nature of justice, truth, society and so on.",
