I noted that it sounded like Elsagate, and fortunately our mutual friend knew what that was so I could describe it while sounding marginally less insane than I normally would have.\n\n\nAnd then he proceeded to ask a question that dealt immeasurable psychic damage to me, which was \"Oh, is Elsagate like Skibidi Toilet?\"\u00a0",

Which is to say, imagine someone bred parrots until they were smart enough to understand and reply to basic sentences, and people used them like answering machines like in the Flintstones. \n\nAs for emotions embedded in the art, that's a real thing but also the art is just pixels and the AI can copy those like any other. AI art models that can deal with a prompt that includes things like 'Make the curtains a wavy blue that looks slightly like the grim reaper looming over the protagonist' are entirely possible. AI art is still art for the same reason movies are, it's just that instead of directing a cast and crew, you're directing an AI art model. How good that art is is limited by how well you can get it to do what you want. It's art by delegation, but that doesn't mean it isn't valid. \n\nAnyway the thing I really want is the brain computer interface, so I can think directly into it, and have it flush out and nicely illustrate all my crazy thoughts.",

They analyze sounds and think logically about what they mean and what happens when they say them.\n\nAn LLM is only aware of what it says in the sense that its output is derived from extremely complicated math. If you tell it you're sad, it will try to comfort you not because it knows what sadness is or desires that you feel better, but because it uses weighted equations to mathematically predict what it should say based on the millions and millions of chat logs it's eaten. The only reason what it produces even sounds remotely human is because humans are simpler and more predictable than we like to imagine; it has no idea what any of the text it's producing means, and there's no amount of refining the model that will result in anything but a more effective mimic.",

I don't see how the process of AI learning is meaningfully different from human learning. It's at least analogous to it, and I don't agree that no amount of refinement will lead to anything but a better mimic, as advanced processing of all of this data might just be what it needs to figure out the meaning behind things, and then start processing more advanced concepts it's discovered in the training data.",
