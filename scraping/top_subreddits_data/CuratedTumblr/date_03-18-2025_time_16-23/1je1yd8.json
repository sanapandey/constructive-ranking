Information would be knowing the actual person, effectively being able to explain anything you might want to know about them.\n\nKnowledge is about how information connects. Maybe you understand that the person from earlier is likely tall because their parents are both tall, or you understand that the reason the catch the train everyday is because they attend a school that you also have information about.\n\nInsight is being specifically knowledgeable about a single piece of information. You may not know about many people in general, but you have specific information about a family member or your best friend.\n\nWisdom is a specific connection that you know well even if you don\u2019t know much about the broader context or reasoning. You might know that cooking tomato in a pan after cooking chicken in it will make the pan easier to clean. Even though you probably don\u2019t understand that this is due to the acidity of the tomato dissolving the chicken bits. You might know that if you catch a specific train at a specific time, you will get to where you need to go, even though you don\u2019t know the name of the train or its full schedule.\n\nA conspiracy theory may be tangential to information and may even contain pieces of information and knowledge connections, but you are also just making up connections between pieces as well as making up whole pieces of information. This paints a picture that is not originally there. This picture would also likely have been preconceived by the conspiracist, there is no way to form a unicorn from that information unless you choose to.",

It's the difference between BBC Sherlock deduction and actual logical processes.",
