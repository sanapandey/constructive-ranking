They caused chaos and terror. That is always an aim of terrorists. \n\nThe aim of the second hijacking appears to have been to take the passengers hostage (especially any Jews or Americans on the plane) and use then as bargaining chips later. In this case, Leila Khaled was actually released by the UK in exchange for hostages taken from other flights. \n\nTaking hostages which can then be released in exchange for peace deals or traded for captured allies is a classic move of terrorists. This strategy has been employed by many Palestinian terrorist groups in particular.",

Chattel. With whips, chains, rapes and slave boats.\n\nAny reasonable person would want a 2-party solution, but reasonable people have never ruled a middle eastern country long. The sad truth is the chance at a free palestine died when Hamas won the election over the PA, it will likely now die with Hamas over the course of the next year or 2. \n\nNetanyahu was THIS CLOSE to being ousted by the Israelis who wanted peace and unity in Israel and with the Gazans. Hamas was terrified by this, the minute the conflict ends they don't get billions from Iran and millions from angry people around the world. So they raped and murdered women and children, making sure every Palestinian got to play with the bodies and spit on the dead.\n\nThey killed the peace and it will never come back because of greedy, hateful men and women. \n\nIts not about destroying capitalism you daft shit, it's about being on top of the pyramid.",

I'm not saying Mizrahi Jews haven't also faced extreme discrimination, they absolutely have, it would just be incorrect to describe them as holocaust survivors since that was something that they did not experience for the most part. \n\nAlso I'd like to add the context that in the modern day desperation is far less of a factor in colonizing (as you put it)  Palestine. I think it's more accurate to call it jingoistic nationalism, expansionism. People can support that if they want, I'll disagree but I can't stop them, but I think it should at least be called what it is. \n\nIsrael's military is one of the most competent in the world and they are backed by the US, absolutely the most powerful in the world. They have shown multiple times throughout history to be very capable of defending themselves against their neighbours (see the Six-Day War for example), as well as fighting groups like Hamas or Hezbollah (remember when they blew up the pagers of many Hezbollah members (and some civilians)? That's not the tactics of a desperate people, that's not guerilla warfare). \n\nThe destruction of Gaza following October 7th has been called the [Gaza Genocide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_genocide) by many groups, and people can justify that genocide if they want, they can believe in collective punishment or colonialism, I can't stop them, but it should be called what it is in my opinion. The level of destruction used against Gaza and it's people is not one that a desperate people have to use, genocide like that does not come from desperation. \n\nLike I think it's an oversimplification, possibly to the point of being a falsehood, to characterize the current situation in the Levant as a conflict between desperate holocaust survivors and the people they're colonizing, though at least we both agree that it's colonialism.",

(Calling this because that was what the land was called before Israel was a state; specifically I\u2019m referring to the region encompassing both Israel and Palestine.) Just \u201cmaking the colonies go away\u201d isn\u2019t really a solution; the Israelis have lived there for several generations now and removing them would also be tantamount to genocide. On the other hand, what Israel is doing also happens to quack quite a bit like a genocidal duck, much like the Fire Nation\u2019s backing of Yu Dao, before they reached a compromise.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that our leaders during this time are more like Ozai than Aang or Zuko.",

Post WW2 both the leaders of the UK labour and conservative parties had given support to creating an independent Isreal, but the foreign minister, Bevin, was not in agreement and was actively sabotaging Jewish immigration to Palestine. Thousands of refugees from Europe were detained in Cyprus, and ships were sabotaged by the secret service, with fake Palestinian terror groups used as cover. Part of this was the belief that Palestinians were less hostile to Britain and therefore easier to control. In the end the UK quickly handed the issue over to the UN. Palestine was never a very profitable colony in any case (few outside of India, Malaya and Hong Kong actually were), and with Egyptian independence imminent was of limited strategic value. Britain absolutely should be blamed for the current situation, but it wasn't solely pro-Isreal, nor was it part of some grand plot. Britain just fucked up.\nEdit: and just to be clear, never should have been there in the first place. Imperialism is bad.",

The Ottoman empire collapsed and its territory ended up being administered by the winning nations (because government administration is actually kinda fucking important).\n\nThe plan pretty much from the start was to start parceling it up into states that could be granted independence. For that, for the most part, the preexisting ottoman regions were used.\n\nMandatory palestine became a bit of an issue because the territory was quite large and had a lot of internal conflict. A bunch of antisemitic pogroms were happening, the jews were responding by creating their own militias (which is where the haganah came from, then irgun, then lehi). Which eventually spiralled into a civil war in the nineteen thirties.\n\nA lot of different solutions were discussed and the British favoured a one state solution with equal rights for all (in the British white papers from 1939 to 1941).     \nThe arabs turned that one down.\n\nThen in 1946 a big chunk of it was turned into Jordan. The remaining bit (what is now Israel and palestine) was recommended to be put into two separate states, one jewish majority and one arab majority.     \nThe arguing just kept going and in 1948 the British pretty much just said \"fuck this I'm out, you guys can figure this shit out on your own\" and they left.     \nThe jews declared their own state, the arabs declared war, and then the war in 1948 happened.",

Britain got enthousiastic about Jewish colonization in Palestine at about the same time that all European colonial empires did, between 1900 and 1910, and the established the conditions for Jewish colonization when their colonial administration in Palestine was established in Palestine in 1922.\n\nThe British actually cut back on their support for Jewish colonization massively in 1939, following the Great Arab revolt of 1936-1939, which is around the time the Holocaust began. In 1939 the British commited to making Palestine independent under majority rule within 10 years, and changed the immigration policy from unlimited Jewish immigration to a very permissive but normal immigration policy (about 25% higher immigration rate than the modern US).\n\nThe British never then went back on these policies. They were not willing to fight the Jewish extremists who turned to violence to prevent majority rule, which enabled those extremists to derail the introduction of majority rule, but after 1939 they only failed to stop the extremists, they never actively supported them in the way they had before 1939",

This turns into decades of anti-semitic riots and pogroms until the Jewish populace start to form their own nationalist militias to protect themselves. The years under British mandate are marked by the rise of both Arab and Jewish nationalist resistance, as they would fight both each other and the UK. By the time WW2 ends there's already been nearly 70 years of nationalist conflict.\n\nAmerican apocalyptic beliefs by the way had nothing to do with anything until they start becoming relevant in the 1980s or maybe 70s.",

It's not like Christian Zionists don't exist in other places in the world.\n\nBut it is a Biblical understanding of history that led the British to give power to the people who founded the modern Israel, given that the land was being shared for a long time - even in conflict - by Jewish people and non-Jewish people, to the Jewish people who pushed out the non-Jewish people.\n\nThey could just as well have chosen any of their colonial holdings to give the Jewish people a safe space, or God forbid create social campaigns to integrate Jewish people into existing society and crack down on antisemitism in the post-war world.\n\nAlso, it's my understanding that there was no meaningful \"Palestine\" following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, so to say \"Palestinian Xenophobes\" seems to me to be ahistoric. Islamic sentiment in the area may have been hostile, but as someone who is against the dominance religion has in the decisions communities and governments make I'd say yeah, they're wrong for hating Jewish people. That doesn't justify Israel and their Ethnostate project.",

Iran did, Egypt did, even Afghanistan did -- you know what all three of those places have in common? Regimes that lost all legitimacy because western imperial powers rode roughshod over them to fill their own pockets. When you can't rely on religion for popular support, you have to substitute it with something else. In these cases, it was nationalism and the pursuit of prosperity and you denied us both.\n\nCan you really blame people for seeing these projects fail miserably because greedy western oligarchs don't want to give up their shares in APOC or the Suez Canal, and lacking an alternative, start listening to the people who promised they could return to the time where Islamic civilization was the world's greatest? Incidentally while the US makes deals with the House of Saud to be their personal enforcers in exchange for oil. You talk about taking responsibility when you literally never gave this part of the world the chance to do so. \n\n>Also, it's not like the arab world were not already massacring and forcing to flee their jewish populations prior to the existance of Israel. Was that also to blame on the west?\n\nYou tell me. The MENA region was full of European ~~colonies~~ Mandates at the time. Mandates that existed because of betrayed promises to the Arabs that they'd be granted countries of their own.",
