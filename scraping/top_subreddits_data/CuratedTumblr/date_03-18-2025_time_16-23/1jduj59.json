The disabled and elderly are going to be first in line to be cut and probably to be dead in the street, but programs that help anyone attempting to flee abuse are going to be destroyed too.  There is a very important reason for why the disabled and elderly should be watched as miner's canaries in any society.  You may not like us or the programs that help us, but the fact is, those programs can only exist in a decently healthy society that can afford them.  We are your society's health bar.  If we start disappearing, you should be worried.\n\nOur world is about to change for the worse in a lot of ways.  One of them is that there will be no more safety from domestic/familial abuse.  People, adults and children, will be trapped with their abusers until they die.  That will be the norm.  Deaths from domestic violence are going to go up, deaths from child abuse, disease and neglect are going to go up, suicide and homelessness rates in general are going to go up.  In order to stay alive, people will have to stay in the embrace of the people that treat them the worst.    \n  \nHuman suffering is going to go up.  And in 3-5 years, that will be the norm.  No one will even talk about what it used to be like; it'll be like a pipe dream.  By that time, this administration will have diverted so much of the governmental budget to an already bloated military and police force, that any form or hope of resistance or positive change will be crazy talk because everyone will already know that all a protest will do is leave you writhing on the ground from being hit with a sonic weapon or cold on the dirt with bullets fired by your own government.    \n  \nThis is the future that we are actually looking at.  I have no idea if there is any hope of diverting it, but if there is, the first step towards it is people actually realizing the reality of what their future will be like.",

It didn\u2019t always work, but he personally convinced dozens to leave, and takes credit for around two hundred indirectly (a lot of police think the number is *way* higher, and that he could be credited for thousands, but those two hundred are just the people who specifically mentioned him as inspiring them to leave). \n\nDude\u2019s a solid guy, and he\u2019s a personal hero of mine.

Beyond that, she's presumably not going to any great effort to campaign on the behalf of the movement, since she doesn't believe in it and can easily demure simply by claiming it's not her place or whatever. \n\nLike, if you wanna argue we should have a robust social safety net so people can leave bad situations without fear, that's one thing, but to claim MAGA gains a significant amount of strength from people being trapped as OP describes is just plain wrong.\n\nAlso, final note: OOP makes the claim that they know women who lost the house in the divorce, but were stuck with the kids. While this can certainly happen, given the way divorce codes are setup in every state I'm aware of (and I live in the deep south), a husband divorcing his wife on a midlife crisis *and* sticking her with the kids would lose the house and pay out his eyeteeth in alimony (as well he should, but that's a side point). \n\nThis is further evidence to suggest OOP is latching on to a handful of negative experiences and treating them like the norm, when realistically nothing they've described sounds particularly likely or reasonable except in absolute fringe cases. And while I'm not disparaging the importance of those cases just because there's fewer of them, I am saying that it's extremely bad form and also just generally unpersuasive to state your case like these are pervasive, widespread issues when in reality they simply aren't common at all.",

In short, I think it allows too much room for conspiracy and accusation. Above all else, elections must be legitimate. Secondary to that, elections must seem legitimate. The mere fact Trump was able to make an accusation of election fraud in 2020 and not immediately be laughed at of the room by every median, undecided voter is evidence that we have a problem.\n\nAs for your point, I would say how often do you really think that happens? Sure, it probably happens somewhere, it's a big country with a lot of people in it, but does it happen often enough to even remotely alter the outcome of an election? Almost certainly not. Once again, there are problems on a humanitarian level (ie, abusive spouses are bad, and we should do something about that), but not even remotely significant to our current overarching political situation, and arguing that these things are in fact a major contributing factor to our current situation without backing it up simply undermines the whole notion and makes the speaker seem like an alarmist at best. \n\nLike, honestly, did you find OOP's claims to be logically compelling? Do you genuinely believe that there's a significant number of people voting for fascism because they're coerced by their families? Or is it more likely, realistically, that that's just how people voted because they were seduced by promises of cheap eggs and whatnot.",

If MAGA women didn't support their bigoted husbands, they would leave, but plenty of them are hateful pieces of shit themselves that would gladly throw \"DEI\" people under the bus and act like pick-mes. I've had randos in local Facebook groups call me a pedophile and make threats against me and group admins do jack shit about it. Mostly bitter white women too (and of course bitter white men), because they have nothing going for them except hate even when I try to be polite to them. No more, I'm saving my sympathy for leftists that fucking deserve it.\n\nTons of red states get funding from blue states but then act like welfare is bullshit and also wasted on \"DEI\" people. Why should we keep spoiling people who keep voting in their worst interest? They need to make their own fucking GOP politicians do some actual work instead of voting for the bigotry and then crying for \"far leftists\" to save them only for them to go back to crying about how leftists are stinky for making them care about \"DEI.\"\n\nMAGA voted for demolishing social services, if they don't like it, then maybe they shouldn't vote MAGA? I know several LGBTQ people fleeing Texas and other states to avoid the nonsense that MAGA voted for.",

If you remove their tongue, their ability to lie is limited. If you remove their hands, their ability to do is limited. I don't want fascists dead, but I do think there should be limits on what they can do.\n\n>HOWEVER. We can't.

There's probably other things, too, but if you ask me those are my big ones.\n\nAnd, frankly? I struggle to imagine a line I wouldn't cross to get there. I feel no compulsion to consider their well-being a factor in my political project, because apparently the well-being of others is less relevant than the prices of eggs",
