It may be demoralizing to know that we can never rest, but it's why we keep finding ourselves in these situations.  People grow complacent.  They act like every victory over evil was lasting.  It's not, and it never will be. Accepting that might actually improve things.  In the US if the Democrat party actually realized they couldn't just reason with MAGA supporters or that half measures and meeting them where they are wouldn't actually work they might have had a chance to prevent a significant amount of damage to their civil rights and national wellbeing.",

We must be vigilant in making sure that we do not let ourselves justify the chaining of others, no matter the pretense. If we can do this, then we have already won half the battle.",

That's why 1940s german fascism tries to use then scientific and mathmatic ideas to push their agenda while modern american fascism actively rejects similar rhetoric. Or how fascism in 1940s romania can be anti monarchist while in imperial japan it's subservient to the emperor.  And how fascism uses totalitarian symbols and imagery (appeals to unity, order, and heavy use of military imagery) and then meanwhile a good number of fascists in the US are paranoid of \"feds\" and rely on imagery of libertarianism",
