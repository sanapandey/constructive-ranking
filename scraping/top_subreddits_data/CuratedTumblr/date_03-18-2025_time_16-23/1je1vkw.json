They want you to keep those parts of your body because that's what they are attracted to. \n\nThere's a reason t4t is so common, because often times only another trans person can both understand the struggle but also feel attraction to the body.

But they may have gender roles. Often with several more genders than 2.\n\nMen don't die in childbirth, are much more disposable in their youth, and are physically stronger. Which means that when you transition to agriculture, any region where people fight over land will be male dominated in no time.\n\nThere are some exceptions, regions that lived out of the sea, not in the form of trading empires like Genova, but seafaring that employs a good chunk of the men, such as we could see in the coasts of western europe or Indonesia; often develop a dual power structure were men have the economic dominance, but women control family and civil life because they are the people there. But this gets more confusing at a macro level because these regions are rarely independent and dominated by other regions that may send men to control civil life.\n\nAs we have developed more, the women and men divide has become more and more a division of labour. Women work the house, tend the children, and if they are not part of the privileged station, work a menial job that pays a significant amount less than the male counterpart. This is still advantageous to the economy because there is a clear division of labour that frees the male gender to be more productive, more exploited in their job and pay it forward to their partner, that has very few avenues to scape.\n\nAs jobs have become less and less physical we have seen the system start to break down . Women have entered the workforce as productivity needs have risen .Women are kept away from desirable jobs by simple social inertia - being excluded by their male would be peers , as they feel that it would lower their place in the hierarchy.\n\nBut that system is running more and more into it's own contradictions. In the west, there are very few material justifications to explain the current state of things. But there is plenty of ideology.  And we have seen it being methodically being ground down. Even if we are currently seeing a reactionary explosion.\n\nI couldn't weave it into the narrative, but there are a lot of things that need change from the other way as well.\n\nMany jobs on the lower qualification spectrum are heavily dominated by one gender. This leads to toxic attitudes .  It needs to be addressed .\n\nThe current rules we have for \"how a man should approach a woman, and how should the woman reply \" are so confusing that it's a leading cause of reactionary radicalization among men. It would probably be better to live in a world were the gender roles of this have been erased. All the women I've dated asked me out. Because I really suck at it.",

And then they never learn the more advanced theory or anything beyond \"patriarchy is that annoying thing the guys I know do\", and they're the ones who tend to post online. Of course, most probably will not and should not study gender studies at a graduate level, so it would be hard to make that better, and that type of person often takes any challenge to their views to be someone gleefully enforcing patriarchy.

And women face obstacles for being seen as powerful and dominant.\n\nThese things clearly have negative consequences for both genders, but at its core, the expectation of our system of gender is that it is divided strictly into two groups at birth, with one holding power over the other.

I'd have loved a scene earlier of Alan calling out the Barbies for being the allegorical patriarchy the kens were struggling under, saying something like \"just because they're in the wrong doesn't mean you've always been in the right, when we fix this you have to do better\" so when we get to the supreme Court scene, it starts off as an immediate \"no\", President Barbie sees Alan and remembers his words and makes an effort to change and rectify past mistakes. I felt that the joke was good but basically kneecapped the two stories they were telling. Like what the Kens are both perpetrators of the IRL patriarchy and victims of the allegorical patriarchy but the Barbies are only victims of the IRL patriarchy? I don't think the movie is man hating or anything, but when you break the allegory it kinda struggles. Like shouldn't we be leaving the theaters miffed at the Barbies?\n\n* In a sexist society where men do whatever, women constantly vye for their attention and are treated as accessories, one man leaves.\n\n* A woman obsessed with him leaves too and discovers a toxic form of gender empowerment.\n\n* She returns to her home, takes power, only for the man to come back and pit them against each other. The men taking power back is literally a celebration and the films climax.\n\n* Everything returns to the status quo where the idea of women getting some power is laughed at, women are told to just don't define themselves by their men, and the only man to become empathetic to women's struggles fucking dips.\n\nIt all falls a bit flat for me because if they just committed to highlighting the Barbies as the allegorical patriarchy but willing to change and be better, the move would be phenomenal instead of just good",

A degree of love and pain remains, and a little part of you just wants to protect them. If all women are abusive, then yours wasn't *that* bad, you know? She was a nice one. It's just that all women are a soul sucking mess by default, yadda yadda. \n\nIt's really hard to keep the bitterness at bay. I've found myself having to consciously watch my train of thought to prevent it from going into an \"all women\" direction. I hope I can find another great woman some day. A calm one who actually enjoys being happy and doesn't need screaming matches to feel loved. But how? I even know a couple gentle and lovely women who flirt with me, and in the past I've thought that I would love to ask them out if I wasn't already married, but now that I'm single again, the mere thought of getting together with another woman makes my guts twist and knot. And I feel so damn *free* now. Pointless, sad and empty, but free, and not as sad and empty as I felt being a punching bag.\n\nIt's really hard not to generalize, even if you rationally know it's bullshit and there's many wonderful women out there. The impulse comes from very deep, and it's full of bitterness, resentment, and wounded love that you just don't know where to pour anymore. \n\nI hope it gets better with time.",

As humans we run to group identity when we feel we are under threat and, in this case, that is running directly into the arms of the problem.\n\nOutside of people with a particular kink, no one other than men give two shits about their penis size unless it is so far to one extreme or the other that it creates an issue purely from a practicality standpoint.  The rest is all social messaging from other men or women who, by and large, got it from men.  It is an especially difficult insecurity to overcome, and as it is seen as a symbol of masculinity, many men seek to feel masculine by exaggering other such cultural symbols, which is where we start getting into trouble.\n\nIt's hard to talk about because it's a big generalization and people really *really* tend to take things personally, even when explicitly not meant that way.  I'd suggest that cishet men are particularly prone to this sensitivity due to the priviledge that group has historically enjoyed that has become so normalized that it feels like an absolutely unthinkable departure from what they understand of the world, basically causing a panic.  And honestly, I get that, too.  I'm just so, so tired and I really should just--well, I can't really stop myself from trying to make it all better, if by vaguely gesturing toward something I don't think is obvious without a perspective only a small number of people have the opportunity to gain.\n\nI haven't taken the pay-attention meds this morning--my apologies.  The point I'm trying laboriously to get to is that \"stop listening to other men\" is not the answer.  The answer is *fight back*.  Like it or not, men *have* to help themselves out of it because we need them to dismantle the male-branded power structures that enable this.  It's a cycle of seeing comfort with harmful coping mechanisms that reinforce the very thing that generated what hurt you in the first place.\n\nAgain, interpret in light of my implied biases.  I thought I was a boy for a very long time.  This shit never made sense to me, and apparently when I tried to talk to other guys about it, I didn't make sense to them.  Not really.  And I tried.  We've all *been* trying, and it just slipped backward.\n\nSomehow, someway, it has to be men who break the cycle.  I could never figure out how to convince them of that when they saw me as nominally one of them.  When your comfort after a long, exhausting day of work is a cigarette, you don't want to hear how bad it is for you, that it's a contributing factor to your general exhaustion, and christ knows I don't want to take your comfort away from you.  I can only support you and be ready to help when you're ready.\n\nIDK if that made sense, but I've got to stop.  I just feel like I'm going to cry.",

While I may not 100% agree you got me in the 90% margin at least and you were very fair about your own perceptions. Don't think that's worth a downvote. Have an upvote to fight the tide!\n\nAnyways, I generally think that it is a joint effort. While women might not care about dick sizes I have seen many of them use the fact that men care to abuse them. Though I think the obsession with that is kinda fading. Though maybe I just haven't heard much discussion around it since I stopped being a teenager all those years ago.\n\nBut things like money, power and sex appeal being tied to a man's value are very much enforced by women as much as they are men. Based on who they date and so on. Basically the only task I would really give women to dismantle the social side of patriarchy is be more open minded about who you date. But women like my wife are proof that many women are. I was broke as fuck when we met \ud83d\ude2d\n\nThat. And people that call themselves feminists need to stop making hating men their whole personality. It pushes men away from progressivism in  a society that already neglects them the tools to figuring their own shit out",

When I say \u201cmasculinity/femininity standards and expectations are too strict\u201d I absolutely include society as a whole. I know many people like to act in ways that fit well within gender norms. I still want the norms gone for everyone though.\n\nIn your example, I would still want the people who live fulfilling lives as surgeons to have the option to leave. They may love what they do, but it would be a form of prison if they were prevented from leaving. The only way to do that is to remove the norms, pressures, and standards for everyone. Everyone should still be free to be men, women, surgeons, or whatever they like, but as a society we should get rid of the social restrictions surrounding these things.\n\nWhen I say I think gender is too restrictive, yes, I am saying so in large part because I\u2019ve felt restricted by it. But it would still be restrictive if I hadn\u2019t. It remains restrictive even in ways that don\u2019t affect or restrain me.

Asked questions, was a little sad I was so terrified he wouldn't keep me around over it. We started gaming together, talking on voice chat daily.\n\nIt makes sense in hindsight due to his love of gender fuckery in the characters he makes, but it turns out he *does* like men. Just a specific flavor, same as me. But holy shit, the fewer words I summarize our situation in, the worse it sounds. You have to add in the years and years of affection, self-discovery, and sheer fucking luck that we work so well together.\n\nIn other words? Never seek this out.

And I think that did make the difference there. \n\nAdmittedly tho, given the Discourse in sapphic spaces in general, especially around mspec lesbianism, I tend to shy away from strong anti men sentiments period anyway, especially bc then us nonbinary folks get shoved into new binaries of man and non man and it gets exhausting that way too bc being called non man just feels like I\u2019m being called woman lite, and that\u2019s never good either.

Many people when asked what if it was a grizzly instead or even a polar bear (whose encounter would mean death), countered with black bears are more likely and kinda ignored that the most likely random woods encounter would also be a solo hiker who just waves at you.\n\nNot saying that this is something you perpetuated, but just what I personally encountered during the whole mess.",

I know I'll never tell a woman not to prioritize her own safety. Our catch is we're tired of being told that we must also *like* being treated like that, and any discomfort we have at it is because we're secretly the monsters they need to be mindful of. It's a massive kafka-trap where even the slightest critique is instantly met with people using the exact same rhetoric racists use in justifying hating black people or \"YOU'RE WHY THEY PICK THE BEAR!!\". It does absolutely nothing helpful in getting more men to care about women's issues, and when the only criticism pointing out how it's a bad hypothetical are tolerated by the manosphere it only encourages them to not listen to us. We can't expect em to stick around and hear the nuanced explanation of why women prioritize their own safety, hoping to foster deeper empathy to women's struggles when we come out of the gate with highly emotional attacks and then attack them for responding emotionally. Would you want to stick around and hear a conversation about say \"guys struggles of maintaining a relationship when you are emotionally vulnerable with a woman who either weaponize it against you or instantly lose attraction, and the deeper nuances of dismantaling toxic gender norms\" when the conversation starts with \"I'd rather crash into a tree and die than listen to a woman talk about her day, no no you just don't get it. You don't instantly agree? You're part of the problem and are inherently toxic.\". I really just look back on it and I fucking saw from day one how it would become a shitshow. This is why I compare it to MeToo because it was less \"you are a monster and a sexual predator, now shut the fuck up\" and moreso \"every woman has a story of creepy men and sexual assault is rampant, it's not you but it's all of us so please listen\". It was an absolutel failure of communication from the start.",

I'm very happy as my partner's exception. The problem isn't being an exception, the problem is when they don't ACTUALLY consider you an exception. Whether it's my co-worker with her cis husband or my partner with me, a trans nonbinary person, what matters is respect.\nMy partner is straight, but completely respects my identity and has ended a friendship over someone saying he \"disagreed\". He has encouraged me to get top surgery, helped with my recovery, and is always looking for ways to affirm my identity. He might be straight, but he is completely onboard with me being nonbinary. Back when I was less certain in my identity, he told me that he had mentally prepared himself for the possibility of me being a man, just in case that was where my gender journey took me.\nSo don't fear being an exception, but don't tolerate anything less than enthusiastic support. If your partner isn't encouraging you to pursue whatever transition steps excite you, if they don't compliment your scars, if they aren't your top advocate, etc., then they're not worth your time.",

That first line of OOP was kinda a red flag, because doling that out as a blanket statement is odd to me, (Not saying that it was something OOP agreed with since they were using it as a lead in to what they were talking about) because of the fact sexuality is a spectrum. If you consider yourself straight, and your partner is a trans man, as long as the relationship is healthy who am I to judge? My roommate in college was dating someone who out and out called herself a lesbian. They'd been together for half a decade and the reason she used that label was because she was 95% only attracted to women, (her words) but he was the exception, and they love each other and have a great relationship (they're married now). When I was more uneducated on the topics of gender and sexuality it was honestly an eye opener to the concept of the spectrum of sexual identity and also really helped me get my foot in the door on understanding the gender spectrum. Hell, I'd consider myself Cis but I also could be considered non-binary because I use He/They.",

Then, I came out to her, transitioned, and then we were lesbians. But then, my now wife, expressed wanting to transition. I was still new on E, and I was not attracted to men. I told her so, and she thought about it more and it got put off. Then, a few more months went by and I discovered I was bi too. My now husband transitioned, and I even got a gf too!

That they can get away with just \u201cplaying along\u201d using their partner\u2019s new pronouns while they wait for this \u201cphase\u201d to blow over. Some surely believe that their trans partner will not actually transition and will go \u201cback\u201d to being their normal cisgender girlfriend if they can wait it out.\n\n\u2026The community sees this a lot, so *dump your straight boyfriend* is indeed a common refrain. The transition of one partner in a relationship is a huge paradigm shift, as is having to evaluate whether the breadth of your own sexuality encompasses the person your partner might become\u2026so it\u2019s natural and expected that some relationships might go through a rocky, uncertain period when one partner transitions, before the decision can be made whether to part ways or keep trying. The problems arise when straight men deliberately string along their trans male partner, placing limits on their physical or social transitions simply because they want to maintain the relationship but don\u2019t want to date another guy.\n\nTransitioning can be scary, it frequently leaves people feeling adrift and isolated, at least at the beginning. Losing the security of a romantic relationship can only compound the feelings of loss, insecurity and rejection that many newly out trans people face. \u2026So a lot of trans men early in their journeys blind themselves to the reality of their situation, and come around looking for assurance that their relationship with the straight man who keeps telling them not to take T could possibly work out\u2026seeking to prolong their own hurt vs facing the inevitable ripping off of the band aid. Hence the emphatic cry of the rest of the community to dump your fucking straight boyfriend.",

Bi lesbians have been around since forever and they ain\u2019t goin anywhere. the connotation of lesbians only being attracted to women is more recent and has more to do with old prejudices both against (grrrrrr man hating lesbians!) and by (radfems) the lesbian community. \n\nThis is also related to why he/him lesbians are a thing. there\u2019s a fair amount of people who spent significant amounts of time as butch lesbians only to later realize they were actually a man. These are people with lesbian wives who hang out at lesbian bars with their lesbian friends they met in lesbian organizations. To cease to be a lesbian for them would be to abandon their entire life and start over, which is ridiculous. well, that and there\u2019s some women who just like using he/him for funsies basically, similar to how some gay men will use she/her. shout out to that one girl who used she/her for years as a gay man and then eventually transitioned and decided that the only reasonable option was to start using he/him",

What constraints does a Lack of gendered expectations impose, as opposed to gendered expectations which Do have those social constraints?

That seems pretty backwards, no? Against the whole premise of equality perhaps, qualifying everything with \"But it's a woman so its fine\" or \"Boys will be boys\". You can't have your cake and eat it too, and reinforcing the mechanics of gendered behaviour because \"someone likes how the label sounds, let people enjoy things\" is simply not quite the stunning defence of \"let's keep gender even though much of what it creates in society is observably Not Good and whose benefits - the ones which aren't already redundant - are questionable at best\". \n\nOr shall we \"Treat men & women differently but only Sometimes\", a line drawn in the sand which in all likelihood will create more headache than it resolves, a Non-answer given that it's oftentimes the gendered behaviour repeatedly reinforced that is in all likelihood the root cause.\n\nShall we continue to pretend that if the goal is to dismantle Patriarchy, creating the same thing with a pink bow instead to replace it is going to be Objectively better? \n\nIf \"western society\" is built upon gender as a binary thing, are we going to simply pretend that \"It's always had and recognised nonbinary genders, nothing to see here no siree, no systemic issues here between men & women, and there Certainly wont be any problems now that we've started to recognise a third umbrella\"?",
