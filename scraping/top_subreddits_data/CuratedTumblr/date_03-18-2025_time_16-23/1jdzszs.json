Or just how useful putting them in an email signature could be. I used to work with a man who had a name that could be both feminine and masculine but more typically feminine. Until he spoke or met with someone they'd assume he was a woman and he'd get really angry about that but also wouldn't just put he/him in his signature. \n\nI've also seen coworkers get angry about seeing pronouns for someone who just had a name that's not common in the west",

Adding pronouns to an email signature isn't just about convenience; it's about fostering an environment of inclusion and reducing assumptions. It\u2019s crazy how something as simple as a signature could clear up so many misunderstandings. Like your example, the guy with the gender-neutral name\u2014if he'd just added his pronouns, it could have avoided all that frustration. And as for the people who get upset about someone else's pronouns, it really just shows how important it is to be open-minded. Pronouns are about respect, not a statement on anyone's identity.",

They are arbitrary. There is nothing that inherently says that men have to like the color blue, be stoic, have short hair and not wear make up. Those are just traits that our society has randomly decided men should have. And our society has just as arbitrarily decided that the gender of man is tied to the male sex, but that's not inherent. Being male encompasses all of your primary and secondary sex characteristics, and being a man encompasses all of the random bullshit society decided men should be. \n\nYou are assuming that the gender of man is inherently tied to the sex of male, but it isn't. Once you strip away all of the gender roles and expectations from gender, you're left with nothing, because that's all gender is. \n\nSo why is it that academics decided to name the term for how a person identifies with their physical body **gender** identity, when those same people defined gender to exclude all physical characteristics? The term as it's currently used should be sex identity, because that's what it describes.

Thank you (/genuine) for expanding on your point so that we can discuss further. \n\n\n> And quoting studies is only useful if you actually understand the science, which I doubt you do.\n\n\nI have a strong academic background in science, but go off I guess\n\n\n>Gender is the collection of traits, roles, and expectations that each culture divides their people into. They are arbitrary. [rest of the paragraph]\n\n\nI do not, in any way, disagree with this. It is important to me, however, to clarify that the term \u201cGender\u201d is an umbrella term for several different things, such as roles, expression, and identity. Some are entirely socially constructed, others are not. \n\n\n\n\n>You are assuming that the gender of man is inherently tied to the sex of male, but it isn\u2019t. \n\n\nNope! This is not what I meant, and that\u2019s not what I was \u201cassuming\u201d. This is where the misunderstanding has occurred. I said \u201ctied to, but not defined by\u201d, which is something different from what you\u2019re interpreting it to mean. If sex was completely divorced from gender, then a woman would never feel uncomfortable in an AMAB body. Gender isn\u2019t *defined by* one\u2019s sex, but it is \u201cassociated\u201d with it (using associated as an alternative to tied. Intended to mean \u201caffected by, adjacent to, etc\u201d but not \u201cequal to, defined by\u201d or anything of the sort, which is what you were interpreting it to mean). Hence the concept of gender incongruence\u2014 a gender identity that is at odds with one\u2019s body and/or how it is socially perceived. \n\n\n>Once you strip away all of the gender roles and expectations from gender, you\u2019re left with nothing, because that\u2019s all gender is.\n\n\nNah, sex dysphoria is a concept. But you could (and probably do) decouple that from gender based on how you define gender.  \n\n\n>So why is it that academics decided to name the term for how a person identifies with their physical body gender identity, when those same people defined gender to exclude all physical characteristics? The term as it\u2019s currently used should be sex identity, because that\u2019s what it describes. \n\n\nI\u2019d totally be in favor of redefining things. I went with the current definitions because that\u2019s what is conducive to discussion. I\u2019m actually extremely in favor of this reframing, and I think we should have clearer distinctions between sex based and \u201cgender\u201d (more broadly used) based dysphoria because it would make conversations easier and clearer. As an example, I\u2019ve \u201cmet\u201d (loosely used term, met online) people who felt they were transsexual but not transgender. As their gender did not differ from their AGAB but they wanted to transition their sex and only their sex.\n\n\n>If you blindly accept the terms that scientists use without using any critical thinking then you\u2019re going to continue saying contradictory and transphobic shit like \u201cyour gender is an inherent part of your body\u201d.\n\n\nThis stems from a miscommunication. Our neurology/hormonal makeup may have an impact on how we perceive our gender, which is why I do believe that our gender identity is inherent to *people*. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s, for example, some soul thing. You\u2019re equating body to sex (I think?), which is not something I\u2019m doing. \n\n\nAlso\u2026 yes I use the currently scientific terms?

But you've shown good faith and an ability to critically think, so I don't feel the need to viciously drive home every logical point by directly addressing every disagreement, if that makes sense. \n\nAnd for comprehension's sake, I am very deliberate when I use the terms man/woman and male/female. Man/woman refers to gender, and male/female refers to sex. If I say, \"a man\" then I'm referring to cis and trans men. If I say \"male\" then I'm referring to people who currently have male bodies, e.g. cis men, pre-op trans women, and post-op trans men. I am trusting you to be able to handle that level of nuance.\n\nWhat parts of gender are not socially constructed? You allude to the idea that part of gender is connected to your body, but you haven't explained how. I agree that most cultures primarily assign genders based on sex, but that's arbitrary. There is nothing inherent to the concept of gender that means it has to be connected to sex. I'm talking about gender from a high level conceptual perspective. I'm not talking about any particular culture's gender roles. So I would agree that in the US that gender is largely tied to sex, but I vehemently deny that gender itself is inherently tied to sex. \n\nAt a conceptual level, sex IS completely divorced from gender. And you're wrong about women not feeling comfortable in male bodies, because there are a lot of trans women who are perfectly comfortable in their male body. There are also some lesbians who identify as a woman but who take HRT to become male. Both of these groups are women who have male bodies and they're okay with that. Their gender of a woman is not affected by the sex of their male body. \n\nYou are absolutely right that we need more terms, because just grouping everyone under transgender is misleading. Personally, I have been trying to get transsex to be used more often, but I know that's probably going to be a losing battle. Transsexual is outdated and makes it sound like being trans is associated with sexual orientations, but it's already an established term, so.. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

I also just generally need a better word than tied. I am a man and want my sex to be male. For me, those things are connected but there are instances for other people where they are not. It\u2019s kind of a rectangle square, square rectangle situation. They can be connected or disconnected, imo. Most (not all) people want a sex that aligns with their gender. \n\n\n>And you\u2019re wrong about women not feeling comfortable in male bodies, because there are a lot of trans women who are perfectly comfortable in their male body. \n\n\nThis was a miscommunication on my end. \u201cIf sex was completely divorced from gender, a woman would never\u2026\u201d was meant to be an \u201cif [condition] was true then [condition] would never occur\u201d.

(And gender dysphoria is another example of the term gender also encompassing sex characteristics, which leads to confusing statements)\n\n\n>Their gender of a woman is not affected by the sex of their male body.\n\n\nSome people\u2019s genders are\u2026 like\u2026 aligned with their sex?

So strongly agree. I think both transsex and transgender should be terms people can use. It would allow for more nuance. I\u2019m much more transsex than I am transgender, though I am both. I don\u2019t use the former term because it\u2019s been adopted as a dog whistle by some groups, and I\u2019d rather not be assumed to be associated with those groups. Certain demographics can use it without worry\u2026 but I meet the exact physical demographic of the people (age, gender, etc) that use it in a bad way, so I personally am not willing to try and \u201creclaim\u201d it.

It is true that what is expected from each gender changes greatly with culture and time. There were many cultures who even had third genders and so on. But regardless, I think most humans instinctively attempt to identify these groups already as literal children, and then shape themselves to \"fit in\" by adopting the behaviors and stereotypes that we perceive, through pattern recognition, as being associated with each gender. Which is why gender dysphoria is a profoundly distressing mental condition and why cisgender people may feel uncomfortable upon having to do something they perceive as NOT fiting their gender grouping: I believe it is a deep human instinct to seek to be in and be perceived as a member of these groups, and not being perceived as being in the group you instinctively seek to be in can be extremely distressing for most",

Idk \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I\u2019m honestly even more confused than I ever was before. Like I\u2019m not going to change anything, ever, in the realm of becoming anyone or anything, or making any serious body modifications, I\u2019m perfectly content with adhering to the standards I grew up with and grew with. It\u2019s become diffuse. All I maybe know, despite being often considered cishet man or whatever, is that \u201cme have dick\u201d and \u201cme must find appropriate way to fuck with dick, because fuck with dick feel good\u201d and \u201cme not equipped to handle kids capability wise\u201d and \u201cme not equipped to meet a long list of standards to get fuck on dick so me fucked for life\u201d but not in an \u201cincel\u201d type of way. I\u2019m just lazy af. So like I\u2019m seen as this \u2018man\u2019 by all these people, and maybe a trans person would aim for some of my homeostatic property cluster traits type shit, but still I don\u2019t feel like a man. But I could never be trans because I don\u2019t know what gender is or what a woman is anymore. I just \u201cme want fuck on dick\u201d \u201cme want to find the most appropriate way to do that\u201d etc and I would never make serious changes to body or hormones, or try to aim for some gender. I\u2019m extremely content with how I already am. And I accept that many people aren\u2019t extremely content with who they are or look like so they work on that. I don\u2019t care myself",

We have a fair amount of evidence to suggest that being trans/cis is something innate. It\u2019s not a want or a choice. We don\u2019t understand what *makes* people transgender, but we have clues. There\u2019s something, potentially physical, that causes people to experience \u201cgender incongruence\u201d if their gender, and how people perceive their gender, don\u2019t align. \u201cSex incongruence\u201d is also a thing, conceptually, but it is just referred to by the same label\u2014 gender incongruence.  \n\n\nGender dysphoria is split into *so many* different ways of experiencing it.  What you\u2019re familiar with is social gender dysphoria\u2014 wanting people to correctly perceive your gender and call you by the terms of that gender (he/she/they, man/woman/person, etc.) There\u2019s also physical gender dysphoria, which is *not* about how others perceive you, but rather about how you want you body to look. It\u2019s distinct from body dysmorphia because it cycles back around to the term used before\u2014 gender incongruence. \n\n\nThe existence of outliers doesn\u2019t negate the usefulness of a category. A woman (cis or trans) can have a beard and still be a woman\u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean most women have beards. It also doesn\u2019t mean that \u201cwoman\u201d isn\u2019t a useful categorization to have. Outliers are rare. Trans people also aren\u2019t necessarily outliers\u2014 **most** (not all) conform to the expectations of their gender. Beards for men, boobs for women, etc. And it\u2019s not because they \u201chave to\u201d socially, it\u2019s because that\u2019s what makes them comfortable.",
