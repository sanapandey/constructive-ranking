That the solution exists doesn't mean it's not a problem.\n\nAs a comparison, it is possible to memorize the timing on Sunflower's explosions. The issue is not that it *can't* be dodged, however. The issue is that the timing is unintuitive, so it feels unsatisfying to play against. (either frustrated you got hit or like you just got lucky when you dodge)\n\nI can bet money you didn't find this method organically and instead found it precisely thanks to the tool-assisted software.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong: the knowledge you're sharing is valuable and *that's* the value of this video. \n\nBut \"no more Gaius charge hate\" isn't the answer. Charge *still* deserves the hate lol, precisely because of how unintuitive and odd the design is. (and how, in practice, it is wonky and inconsistent, particularly in co-op)",

You can apply that to many other cases such as \"what's the purpose of making Bayle take reduced damage on his body and forcing players to hit his head and leg?\" or \"why is this attack only able to be avoided by jumping\" etc. From Soft likes you to test different approaches with bosses, which is something that's been prevalent since DS1 all the way to Elden Ring.\n\n  \nThis leads into why I think the issue is less about the third hitbox existing and more about how the visuals of it are conveyed. Just having a massive plume behind Gaius could help inform players that dodging through is wrong and creating a more consistent hitbox trailing behind so then players don't occasionally dodge through two would be my improvements.",

Do pros like yourself ever simulate one attack repeatedly to \u201cgit gud\u201d at it or do you just run into fights and learn the whole thing? I\u2019ve made it to Maliketh in the main game but I still feel like I\u2019m actually bad and just get lucky. If I could practice some hard moves on their own that would be cool, even fun. But\u2026 I\u2019m anyway on a PS5 so it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ve just always wondered if some Truly Gud folks out there do this.",

Every other move I repeated was for other reasons, like this video, or testing odd things like jumping/crouching it. I normally use god-mode though and fight the boss for like 30 minutes straight to absorb the move set into muscle memory.\n\n  \nFor Maliketh, he has really low poise (only 80), so I'd recommend using stonebarbed tear on which ever phase you struggle with more and use something that deals high poise damage. For his moveset, I really loved u/SaxSlaveGael's video on it. The video is titled \"How To Beat Maliketh with ANY Build and Avoid ALL His Attacks! (No Cheese, No OP)\" highly recommend checking it out.\n\n  \nBest of luck with your RL1 run!",

The timing doesn't need to be that precise. People in the comments are complaining that your method is unintuitive and so the boss is still bad, but the intuitive dodge is also not *that* hard to achieve.\n\nI totally believe this makes it easier",

My favorite of the 3 commander boss fights for sure. The stance break tear helps a ton as his poise isn\u2019t as crazy as you\u2019d think. Great video!
