My buddy recommended some stuff like the bloodhound\u2019s weapon and other stuff but I\u2019m not so sure about that. He also told me (over 100 times i would say) that I\u2019ll die REPEATEDLY, so that sounds fun \ud83d\udc4d.",

(like this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLdZ8Zex1cw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLdZ8Zex1cw) )\n\nA lot in this game is about \"figuring it\" out and overcoming the associated challenges. Combat is part of that, boss of course, but also navigating around the world, setting your next goal and keeping track of NPC storylines of the NPCs you meet along the way. So be ready to learn and use your brain, because getting better at the game is as much about leveling your character as it is leveling your IRL skills to learn.\n\nThe game is also very open and does very little to actively guide you (no quest log, no indication for which level you should be etc.). Which means usually everyone's journey will be different, you will make different mistakes, gain different experiences, and learn from different things. You can follow a guide or walkthrough, just be aware that you can always do that on a second run as well, but you can never do a blind run again. So don't waste that chance.\n\nAlso, don't try to be completionist with this game. You technically need to play through the game three times for all ending trophies anyway, so you don't have to get everything right first time. Otherwise you will also put a lot of pressure on yourself, which is not needed. As stated earlier, there is always the chance to do NG+ or a second fresh run.",

If you\u2019re in a dungeon, check your corners, walls, and ceilings for traps and ambushes. \n\nAlso, dump your runes before going into a boss fight. Either level up or buy something so you have as few runes as possible.
