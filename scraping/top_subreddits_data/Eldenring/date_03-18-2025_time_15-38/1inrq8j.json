If i had to guess since they vaguely claim the dlc has more bosses and playable characters, whoever paid for the dlc can access the new playable characters (similar to a fighting game) while those who didn't simply won't. And when it comes to bosses i would assume it's just an additional mode that has new bosses, that people who didn't buy the dlc can't access. Think of it as shadow of the erdtree was. You can't access the shadow lands unless you own it. You can't access the shadow of the erdtree weapons unless you buy the dlc. You can fight against people with dlc weapons in the arenas, and cooperators can have those weapons as well. But that's about it.",

It's an experimental game from a different director at the studio with the greenlight from Miyazaki, the asset reuse is letting them try some weird shit on a smaller budget.   \n  \nOf course they don't fully believe in the concept, that's why it's an experiment. If it's sucessful they might commit to a fully standalone game like this with its own world and lore later, but it's a huge departure from their usual style so I see why they wouldn't want to commit a big budget to this.",

Roguelikes have been around for a long time with some of them being incredible successes. Surely Fromsoft can make a multiplayer roguelike from scratch without destroying their finances.\n\nConsidering how fast this game was put together (seriously, the Elden Ring DLC isn't even a year old yet) makes this game feel completely out of place.\n\nThis easily could have been a standalone game. Sure the budget and schedule go up. But for a company like Fromsoft, they can easily afford the risk and have the fanbase to do it. \n\nMaking a game that will sell because it falls under the guise of an incredibly successful franchise makes it a cop out. And arguing it's credibility based on a type of game that is neither new nor innovative proves that point.",

They don't know if this will be a success, so taking all these amazing building blocks that they currently have to create an experimental new game feels like a great idea. There are a lot of roguelike games, but almost all of them are fairly low budget games. \n\nAlso, I don't think a developer needs to waste a bunch of resources just because they have them. I would much rather a developer be shrewd with their resources and put them to good use. All the time and money saving Fromsoft gets from reusing stuff in Nightreign is more time and money they have to create their next big game.",

Hell, I'm one move away from platinum the base game. All I have to do is run the frenzy flame ending. This may be the best game of all time and the DLC was such a positive to look forward to. I am in the midst of the DLC now on my first run yet to complete it. It's an incredible feeling running the map for the first time\n\nAnd in the back of my head, I knew that this DLC night reign was coming out and was super stoked about that. I couldn't believe there was gonna be another DLC content to extend the map further the fact that the shadow DLC was accessible only from the base game in a story related fashion with little instruction was just incredible to me. I loved every second of it.\n\nBut from a marketing standpoint, some young kid buys the DLC and wants to play it. He can't go to his library and click on it instead he has to do research or understand what's going on and find the DLC within the base game. That's asking a lot for some younger fans or fans that are a little more challenged \n\nTo me it's almost like this was a standalone game that they can market and sell to grab those that didn't really hit on the base game Elden ring you see a lot of people claiming the game is too tough or there's a lack of instructions. You know all the things that make us love it so much That is almost the way I look at it. Is this merely a way to create a marketable dlc, that can be opened from the home screen by those who were not exactly enticed by the difficulty of the base game not to claim that the DLC night rain will be any easier or anything it just seems kinda weird to me\n\nNot to mention, rogue like games are fun sure but the amount of time and effort you invested in the original content building your character or characters. It's so rewarding to carry that over to more TLC content kind of bummed out.",

There are also markets on the map to buy items (they are very strong now), weapons and upgrade materials.\n\nThe map in question was always the same, but it has been said that events will occur that will alter the terrain, so I don't know if this will affect anything.\n\nThe field bosses are not so complicated with a little patience you can defeat them, but first I would recommend you to go to the small camps (perfect for weapons, items and runes) and after leveling up 2 times try one of these bosses.\n\nAs for the nightly bosses, they were complicated, especially the draconic sentinel and the other 2 knights of Lyndell (they came together). The lord of the night was not particularly difficult, compared to other bosses in the saga (but you are not going to defeat him the first time).\n\nBased on what I played I would say that it is feasible to play it alone (but you will suffer depending on the boss and your skill with the characters). Sylvester and the guardian are perfect for the first trials and know the new mechanics.",

But after watching vaati\u2019s video shortly before writing that comment, it seems as though this is probably the work of bandai namco milking the success of er, and the massive audience they\u2019ve garnered. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019ll probably be a fun a co-op game that\u2019s sure to land a place as flavour of the month. But after all of this time, from software has built an incredible reputation, built upon non-compromise and creativity, and I guess I\u2019ve come to expect certain things from their brand because of that, such as authenticity. Repackaging a large quantity of old assets and selling it as a boss-rush spin-off with all our favourite dark souls characters from yesterday comes off cheap and hollow to me. I just wish that they\u2019d spent the time and resources on more dlc for er, or perhaps another original ip. But who knows, I\u2019m sure this game will sell just fine and perhaps they\u2019ll funnel some of the profits into their next great title. this is just my opinion, and I digress, as the games not even out yet so it\u2019s not fair for me to say it\u2019ll suck. but I know there\u2019s a tonne of others with just as much scepticism as me runnin around, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.",
