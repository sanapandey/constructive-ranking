After all the laughably far away places you are expecting to meet him, my favorite is his travel to the Shaded Castle in front of the bell bearing hunter boss - I had always killed him way before that. His sequencing may be more confusing than any other in the game. Like for example, Blaidd was incredibly easy to follow - although the first step, asking the first merchant about the howling was brutal. I rode through the howling and spent a few days in weeping peninsula and never thought to circle back to the first merchant to ask about it.",
