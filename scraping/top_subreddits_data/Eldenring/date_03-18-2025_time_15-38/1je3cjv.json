That would severely limit your leveling, but would also be a way to simplify a lot of areas you may have struggled with before. Plus, lore-wise, it just makes sense",

But in ds2, it was the default game mode as opposed to an endgame feature. I got mad when they made the game easier for me, but after beating the whole game and everything before should be relatively simple? Much less of an issue, especially when it's because of the frenzied flame lore more than anything\n\nNot trying to be a ds2 hater, before I get jumped for that. I hated it, but I've come to respect opinions about it and will probably try it again one day. That feature was something that really frustrated me though, I didn't want the game to go easy on me and make things stop spawning when I struggled (I also discovered recently there's a covenant or something to disable that \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)",

Malenia started rotting again the moment she took it out. Millicent and Gowry imply if Millicent left the needle in, it would only allow the rot to grow into something greater instead of killing her. Even Midra is in a similar situation, where his curse to endure is the very thing that allows his pain to curdle into frenzy. The mark of the three fingers is still present on your character too, so there's no reason to believe Melina won't still come around to kill you even if you choose a different ending.",
