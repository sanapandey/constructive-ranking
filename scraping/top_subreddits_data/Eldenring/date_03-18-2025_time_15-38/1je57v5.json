As long as you kill 2 out of the 5 (Godrick, Rennala, Radahn, Rykard, or Mohg,) you can progress to the end. I wouldn\u2019t call Caelid and Radahn tacked on.

            "body": "I can think of a few endings. You could probably do one for each shardbearer, and there should definitely be one for Dragon Communion.\n\nAge of the Grafted. This might add in a mechanic where you start adding body parts to yourself for bonuses, but it corrupts you. After you take the throne, you start grafting everyone in the Land's Between. This is probably the weakest one I've come up with but it could be cool lol.\n\nAge of the Unborn. You and Rennala seal everyone in cocoons to be reborn as perfect beings in your and her own image. I really like this one lol.\n\nAge of Might. You find a way to heal Radahn with Miquella's Needle and together you lead a massive army to conquer every land and rule with an iron fist through martial law. Might invalidate the DLC a little but... meh? There could be political games in there lol.\n\nAge of the Omen. I'm not sure how you would trigger this one, but you'd basically allow the Omens and the demihumans and albinaurics and other groups like that to come out and take over, putting humans under their thumb instead of the other way around.\n\nAge of Hunger. After beating Rykard, be allowed to consume his flesh and become the next host of the Serpent. You take over and devour all life within the Lands Between (including Marika) before setting your sights further afield.\n\nAge of the Accursed. For all the talk of starting the Mohgwyn Dynasty, I think this one should exist already. You should find a special item or type of blood or some ritual that you can use to infuse Miquella's body with Mohg's soul. At the end, when you take the throne, spilling blood becomes a widespread ritualistic practice. An age of human sacrifices and bloodshed. Blood for the Blood Lord. Skulls for the Elden Throne. Wait...\n\nAge of Rot. If you beat Mohg first, or perhaps if you beat the DLC first, you should be able to tell Malenia what happened to Miquella and have her bloom a third time. Let Millicent be a key part of it too. The lands begin to suffer as Caelid did, but through this, new forms of life emerge, twisted and deadly, but beautiful in their own right, like you see with the Aeonia Swamp.\n\nAge of the Dragon. If you really lean into dragon communion, there should be an option to use the power of the Elden Ring to ascend to become a proper dragon and set yourself in charge\n\nAge of the Jar. You save Gigachad Alexander and use the power of throwing pots to subdue the Lands Between and stuff everyone inside jars.\n\nNot necessarily an ending per se, but I think you should be able to use Messmer's Flame instead of the one in the Mountaintop or the Frenzied Flame to burn the Erdtree and save Melina. Could make it the Age of Messmer, but I'm not too familiar with the lore so not sure what it would look like.",

Especially so if it leans into Messmer embracing his fate/curse, compared to Ranni, who refused hers. Have their endings both be \"good\" overall, but be opposites in a lot of ways when compared to one another. \n\nIt's also not like the Erdtree can't be burned another way. The Frenzied Flame works, so presumably Messmer's flame, which works on a similar level in the DLC, would work (it may even be *why* Marika sealed him away to start with). It would add interesting lore to Melina - we know she opposes the Frenzied Flame, but would she oppose using Messmerfire?",

Both of them help out during the Radagon/elden beast fight maybe just by casting some spells or occasionally coming in for the assist. Both unite together at the end to start cleansing Caelid and themselves of their curses. Tarnished maybe choses which sibling to be their consort getting a specific spell or weapon. Miquella gives you that Abundance weapon that was cut whereas Malenia gives you like a weapon to cleanse rot or maybe some type of armor that gives you insane immunity stats\n\nI\u2019d say they are opposed to the greater will due to their curses and treatment though they could also be there. A bit goofy but I\u2019d call this like the Age of Family or something similar. All the remaining children of Radagon and Marika join together to rule. Maybe even those departed are reborn if you kept their souls or maybe just show up for a bit in an ethereal ghost form to give a nod to this new age.

You create a peaceful, equal Lands Between... at the expense of the free will of anyone who might threaten it. It would be a really interesting moral trade off to be able to make, and I'm kind of sad that we can't.\n\n2) Age of Rot. I might slightly biased about this one because I've got an idea for a character and build that I really like, but that would- sadly for me- *only* work well for this. Still, an ending where you can radically transform the Lands Between and all life in it, in a way that can be horrible or beautiful, an apocalypse or an apotheosis, depending on how you/your character see it, would be really cool. \n\n(I *guess* you get a similar thing with the Dung Eater ending, but that involves helping the Dung Eater, so y'know.) \n\nThen, while I don't know if there's enough there to give Rykard, Mogh etc their own endings, I definitely think it would be great to have a proper faction system where you can ally with a specific demigod or group, and have it be at least somewhat immersive (e.g., your allied faction's base of operations won't be hostile to you, but their direct enemies might be more aggressive when you run into them.)",
