Put parry on that thing, and you will likely have an easier time. The buckler is also specialized for parrying, but I find it to be kind of wonky. Plus the buckler parry animation is longer, which can be a detriment. Sometimes you'll get the timing wrong on one attack, but have an opportunity to parry the next. This is easier if you are running a basic small shield versus the Buckler since the buckler animation takes more time.\n\nYou can also \"cheat\" and use Carian Retaliation, or Storm Wall, or Golden Parry to improve your parry frames. These will even give medium shields favorable parry timing. Storm Wall is available right in limgrave so that one is easy to get early.",

It's great for learning the timing of various enemies.  \n\nI guarantee if you played the game with magical parry and came back to regular parry, you'd still notice a very high success rate compared to now. \n\nWhat I mean is you are not selling yourself short.  Your brain gets wired the more you do it.  Higher frequency success helps your brain tune the coordination & rhythm much faster than miss miss miss miss miss.  \n\nI'm saying all this as someone who went that path before.  I tried to learn parrying via dagger.  The struggle was insane.  I wasn't learning the timing because I was always missing.  No confirmation even when I was close.  \n\nPlayed through the game for a while with 'magical parry' as you called it, then came back to parrying with a dagger and guess what?  I'm at a point where it feels the same and I can parry with a dagger pretty darn well.\n\nRest assured, you are not shooting yourself in the foot here.  The skill does carry over.  I'm not making this up and I'm not lying to you.  Just friendly advice here, I get it.  You don't want advice maybe, but here it is in case you're open minded.",
