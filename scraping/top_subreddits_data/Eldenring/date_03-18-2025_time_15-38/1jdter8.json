And the skulls and frozen giants on the mountain are supposed to be his kin/ancestors.\n\nIf I'm remembering correctly, the first giants we see frozen all over the mountain are the other fire giants.\n\nThe skulls found here and in the Dragon Burrow are an even older race of giants that were even bigger. And then you have the trolls which are smaller descendants of the fire giants.\n\nSo basically it was the ancient skull giants, really big fellas. And then the fire giants, big fellas. And then the trolls, moderately large individuals.\n\nNow I could be wrong about this, but I'm pretty sure the skulls you see are much larger than the fire giant. So they're an even older, larger race of giants.",
