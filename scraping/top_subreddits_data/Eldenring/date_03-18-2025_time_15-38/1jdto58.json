It is literally slang and to many people it means more than just \"exploit\". It is essentially a synonym to \"cheap\" to many. Just because u prefer one definiton, or part of the definition, does not invalidate those that dont.\n\n\"Dont ignore 80% of the items\" I would love to see someone try to make use of 20% of the items in the game... You say it as if there are no restrictions on stat requirements, weight, build synergy etc...\n\nYou essentially use that line as some sort of \"gotcha\" when the reality is for every 100 items the game gives you, a fraction of them are even equippable with any given stat set, and of the equippable items a fraction of them are efficient to use with said stat set. \n\nWithout understanding the game, someone could read your comment and assume you can simply use anything you pick up whereas in reality youd need to respec and adjust your set to maintain a certain weight when using most of the new items you find. \n\nRanged combat doesnt exist so that you can respec and rebuild everytime you find an enemy that is susceptible to ranged combat, but rather it simply exists for gameplay variety. Its just one of many combat options. \n\nThe sword of night and flame doesnt exist because its the expected counterplay weapon of enemies a, b and c. It exists because its fuckin cool. Maybe an argument can even be made that such things exist for accessibility, to provide an option for those unwilling to grind and learn movesets to be successful in melee combat, but without confirmation from miyazaki or fromsoft its just pointless conjecture, although it would make sense as being financially beneficial to the game. \n\nPoint being you are clearly oversimplifying the matter. Just seems like cope bc you dont want to admit magic builds/summons trivialize the difficulty of the game.\n\nThey give you a thousand items so that you can pick and choose however you want to play, not because you *are supposed* to use this item or because you *arent supposed* to use that item. \n\nYour argument is just as trivial as those who think you are only really playing elden ring if you use big bonk with no summons.",

I don't condemn using co-op at all. As I've said, I've been using it a bunch because I love playing with people and helping people. The game still gives you achievements and progress so clearly they don't mind you using it. That being said it makes you rely on an internet connection and other people (and also separates people depending on whether they have the dlc which makes sense but is weird). If it was just an alternative version of the bossfight that was balanced to be as hard, by making sure you don't get more windows to heal and increasing the boss's HP even more, then I would consider it not cheese.\nBut as it is. I can't not consider cheese something that let me beat malenia in 2 attempts on my first playthrough, even while staying in melee range of her most of the fight.",

I was thinking it meant anything that makes the game easier than what is commonly accepted as the standard way to play. When I started this game I was a bit afraid of how hard the bossfights would be because that's the impression I got from the internet. But the way I played (not co-op, just extensive exploring), let me beat literally every major bossfight in 1 or 2 attempts. On my second playthrough I tried to rush to Margit to actually get a fair fight and it was still easy. I don't even use anything but melee so I don't get how people find those hard. That makes it difficult to know if I'm cheesing them, if I'm over prepared or if I'm just good at dodging.",

If you want I can give a general explanation of what I did in each bossfight and you can judge if it makes sense why I beat them so fast.\nAlso for most of the optional bosses, I spent a lot more time (shoutouts to the first erdtree avatar, the gargoyles and placidusax).\nAlso big selection bias, cause I didn't talk about all of my struggles with regular ennemies, especially the two days I spent stuck in Leyndell because I didn't see you could climb the dragon that far.",
