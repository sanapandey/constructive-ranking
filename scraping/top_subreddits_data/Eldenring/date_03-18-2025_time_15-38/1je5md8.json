                            "body": "To be fair, INT Caster in the base game ***is*** easier than STR. It can drop a lot of bosses before they can even swing, and minimal dodging is necessary.\n\nThe DLC on the other hand nuked casters into the stratosphere, because there's a rapid attack rate on most bosses that makes casting difficult. More importantly, they basically deleted spacing from the game and every boss gets their own \"heh nothing personnell kid *teleports behind u*\" move, which is disproportionately a problem for casters. That's probably why the spotlight is increasingly on STR users, because while INT deserved the critique for the base game, they are absolutely suffering in the DLC.\n\n**The *real* shafted build type is DEX.** It's been a joke since Dark Souls that those filthy Dex users are easymode peasants, but in Elden Ring, the script was flipped. \n\nSTR has the additional benefit of the occasional stagger, and because bosses have become increasingly harder with smaller windows, you prefer a heavy DPH weapon that does as much damage as possible in one hit over a DPS weapon that tries to get multiple attacks off. Any extra damage DEX milks from it's superior DPS is easily outdone by the free damage STR gets from it's staggers, too.\n\nDex isn't bad by any means, it's just not being recognized properly as the 2nd hardest playstyle of the 5 main damage stats. (hardest being pure Faith, an important exception there being the Blasphemous Blade being the single most broken PvE weapon in the game; otherwise, Faith usually functions as a slower-casting INT)",

I had to research how to get more powerful spells since getting them isn't an apparent thing. Want to get Cannon and Gavel of Haima? Talk to a dude in a church about a key, find the key in the rafters of the academy after taking a path that isn't immediately obvious, go back to the dude to get a gesture, find the tower where you can use the gesture to get access to the spells. It's convoluted. I understand being convoluted is part of the often frustrating charm of this game, but I can find Great Stars in a chest on a road. (I was going to mention Bloodhound's Fang, but in retrospect getting it is also somewhat convoluted).\n\nFor me, every Soulslike I've played has been easier with a STR build instead of INT with the exception of Demon's Souls (my love!). Magic is a fucking cheat code in that game, at least in the PS3 version. It spurred my love of casters.",

Can also pick up Night Comet right at the start of the game. (though yes, you'll need meta knowledge to both snag it and know how to get the 38 INT for it ASAP)\n\nMy INT caster playthrough was *base Vigor* and still one of my easiest playthroughs. There were bosses where depending on their RNG, I might die at the start, but I lazily said \"whatever, he'll do something stupid eventually\" because I recognized I could down him in 5 hits before he could touch me. \n\nLeonine Misbegotten in the Consecrated Snowfields comes to mind; his lunge attack countered me and prevented spell spam, but if he just *didn't* open with that attack, he was dead. Eventually that wasn't his first attack and GG he died without even getting close to me.\n\nOr Fire Giant for example, I didn't learn *shit* about fighting his Phase 2 on my INT Caster. I estimated my spacing, got it right, and Comet Azur'ed him doing his attack he always does at the start of phase 2 and killed him as explosions happened around me, before he even started using non-scripted attacks.\n\nMohg? Free pass.\n\nMalenia? Free pass.\n\nEven Radagon with his \"fuck casters in particular\" parry move, I forget which spell I used but I found one he didn't react to with a parry. Might've been Rock Sling.\n\nIt's just busted. \n\n...*So* busted in fact, that I'm convinced part of Miyazaki designed the DLC saying \"fuck INT Casters in particular,\" because it's absolutely *night and day* to compare how they perform in the base game vs. in the DLC. Painful experience in the DLC, but a walk in the park for the base game where I could skip learning a lot of the movesets.\n\nThe DLC is definitely - IMO - a balancing oddity, because it feels like the base game was jerking off STR and bleed builds, and Miyazaki just said \"say, what if we do ***more*** of that?!\" while completely neglecting Quality builds (who desperately needed help) and giving INT-casters the middle finger.",

            "body": "Having beaten the game with several builds (to be transparent I haven\u2019t beaten SotE multiple times only once) I think all styles can eventually be built OP as hell and have an easier time with different things. You can also make every style really hard if you don\u2019t use OP things. \n\nWhat I will say is have found is that in my experience caster builds are much harder starting out. You have to distribute flasks because you run out of MP quickly and your regular attacks are trash and you don\u2019t really stagger anything. \n\nI find that it is after Rennala is when casters really start to catch up and start having an advantage for a while but towards the end of the game everything can be really powerful. \n\nAlso disclaimer I\u2019m a loser who won\u2019t play any build with 0 range options. Great bow on strength build for pulling and get little ranged jerks who want to snipe me. I just feel having 0 range options on any character is not the type of self imposed disadvantage I want to deal with.",

(which is *still* harder than Night Comet just because you gotta stay in close to the enemy)\n\nFaith weapons is probably the best example of what you're talking about: Blasphemous Blade itself is perhaps the single best PvE weapon in the game, but I found all the other Faith weapons to be good (Golden Halberd) or situational (Black Flame Tornado) at best, and otherwise generally pretty \"meh,\" because they often suffer from the same slow casting issues as the incantations.",

STR builds can reach their hardcap 26 levels earlier than other builds by simply 2 handing. Also stagger is op and Lion's Claw is braindead.\n\nBleed is bleed. Even Malenia is weak to bleed\n\nFTh and Int are carried by their weapon selection.

It also has % damage, with the insane health pools it's op\n\nBleed is just priviliged. Once again,% damage is op, and they made Radahn's weakness bleed. I repeat, they buffed BLEED.\n\nSB Faith got more weapons and older weapons were buffed\n\nSB int stays the same\n\nDex got some nice weapons\n\nPure casters get bullied by the insane speed of the bosses.
