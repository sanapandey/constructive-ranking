Like a full 30-45 seconds of an aesthetic shot of a buiding covered in snow or a dark road. Or these CRAZY long pauses in conversations or having to watch someone get out of a car for a full minute. Like a Wes Anderson film but crank up his quirks and make them corporate. Playing the show on 1.1 or 1.2 speed helps.",

If I were you, assuming you don't want to meme it up topically, I'd just wait for it all to be out and then you can either watch it knowing its a fantastic holistic TV experience, or watch it knowing not to get too invested in the story and just enjoy the vibes.\n\n  \nI know some people would say that's a cop out, and you can enjoy the show for what it is even without any \"ending\", which I dont disagree with. You can certainly watch Art just to watch Art and a lot Severance does feel like Art. But I also personally find narratives that don't actually go anywhere pretty frustrating, TV series that just don't get renewed is a trend, and ultimately feel like a waste of time where I should have experienced something else with that time.",

Exactly what I was fearing.\n\nI also understand the mixed reactions because I assume that people like me who do not like mystery boxes for their own sake are the ones not enjoying it.",

Pretty bleak story, but it\u2019s got a good Mare Of Easttown vibe to it, and Amanda Seyfried\u2019s been solid.\n\n**1923**: Not sure why Sheridan thought having five simultaneous storylines was a good idea.

Probably my least favourite antagonist. I understand he's big in the comics but the characterization just, meh. Don't care about him, especially when he's stacked up against Fisk who, IMHO, is one of the best onscreen superhero antagonists out there. Glad we're seeing more of him and Vanessa. Curious to see how their therapy sessions continue to progress, clever idea.!<\n\n**Wheel of Time S3**\n\nWatched the first episode, made a joke in last weeks thread that 5 mins in I think someone is spinning the wheel faster. Still tend to agree with the sentiment after finishing the first ep. Now that said, I'm only noting it, but I also think I enjoy the faster pace more. The books eventually become a slog to get through, moving things along faster may help alleviate those problems down the line. Also just helps keep things interesting.\n\nFrom what I've seen altogether in the first ep I'd say this season looks better than the previous two and I'm keen to finish the next two episodes today/tonight. I'm happy we've seen improvement season to season. The costuming, the sets, the cinematography, all feel like they had a bit of a boost/facelift.\n\n**Reacher S3**\n\nGood season so far, fun pop'n'chips kinda show. Duffy's drawling accent throws me a bit sometimes, but I like her.\n\n**Invincible S3**\n\nUgh. Season's over already. I like this show a lot, and it has moments of greatness. The last two episodes had such moments.\n\n**Reboot** and **Beast Wars**\n\nRewatched Reboot, and started up Beast Wars again. Loved them as a teen growing up, and now there's some upscales out there that're decent. Reboot's ending is a atrocity and needs a real conclusion, what a cliffhanger.\n\nGarry Chalk as Optimus Primal is a delight to hear again. *\"Well that's, just, prime!\"*",

It gets better when the show released around the time of Winter Solider and everyone seems to think the show was waiting for that moment.  I feel otherwise but regardless the quality improves greatly around the halfway point.  \n  \nSeason 2 becomes what they show should have been the entire time.  Its focused.  its telling a story.  It introduces a concept that should have been present in the MCU from the beginning.  Season 2 is the fucking shit.  \n  \nSeason 3 they took their new focus and added a new story writing technique.  The showrunners hated one long story because it gets boring in the middle.  So for Season 3 they decided to tell two stories.  So you basically get a beginning / middle / end twice.  Its much more impactful.  Shit is happening a lot more frequently and it gets to the fun part a lot quicker.  \n  \nSeason 4 is the god tier season of the show.  They took this new story writing technique and expanded it further into what they called \"pods\".  It has THREE stories all loosely tied together and it kicks so much goddamn ass its on its own level. \n  \nSo the reason you should continue is clear.  The show you want to see is coming and you are almost there.  It gets way more fun as it continues. It also has one of the best depictions of a god tier character in all of live action in my opinion.",

I was really attached to these guys and Firehouse 51 but the show became too tiresome, and just a habit that needs to be cut, sadly.\n\nBut, I want something fresh instead, more of the similar, so any solid firefighting/rescue show as a replacement?",

Basically like suicide squad but a different group and a different mission. And it\u2019s animated pretty good fight scenes in it too. Now my favorite show is warriors on Netflix! It\u2019s a tv show based off a Bruce Lee book following a martial artist Chinese immigrant in the late 19th century during the brutal gang wars in San Francisco. Honestly my fav tv show n one I watch on repeat. Only wish they made a 4th season but it\u2019s on Netflix def check it out.

That doesn't jive with what people irl and critics have been saying. Sure - there was one episode people found to be kind of slow (although I'd argue it was still an amazing episode), but for the most part this season has earned rave review. It had a 9.4 episode on IMDB two weeks ago (the second >9.0 score of the Season). Season 2 has an 86 on Metacritic, and critics were allowed to watch the whole season before reviewing.\n\nPeople are allowed to have their opinions, but stop trying to gaslight the majority of us into believing the show has had this steep decline, just because it's not for you. This shows has always focused on world building and the emotional underpinnings of its main characters. It has never been a fast-paced show, aside from the spectacular Season 1 finale, and what made it spectacular is that it *earned* it. I suspect the Season 2 finale will be the same way.",

            "body": "**Adolescence** was very good. Well acted. Very human. 4 episodes with each episode taking place over a \"single camera shot\" after a horrible crime was committed. >!One day after,!< >!three days after,!< >!a few months after,!< >!and 7 months after.!< Episode 2, >!3 days after,!< is just OK, and I'd be remiss to say we've all seen this done better in any number of cop/detective drama. Episode 4 is very human and well done but some will find it boring. I would match it in vibe with something like Short Term 12 (movie). It's painful and loving and aching. \n\n**Inb4 downvotes,** I'm going to say an unpopular opinion. I don't think the \"single shot\" added much to this show, outside of episode 3, and the opening scene. Also, well stitched cuts is a better expression, since it is not truly one take. I've seen a lot of praise for this but personally I think it is becoming a gimmick  and easier to tell than people claim (especially in episode 2). Nor is it new. Children of Men, Birdman, 1917, the funeral episode in The Haunting of Hill House S01E06 consisted of 3+ 20 minute takes sewn together, Mr Robot S03E05 is one take with hidden cuts through camera work ... I can really go on quite a bit longer ... And every time it is treated like it has never been done before and it's been done since Hitchcock. It's just far easier to do now with tech. From a cinematographic POV, it can be interesting and special, but just doing it without it really needing to be done feels gimmicky and, if anything, shows how easy this maneuver has become. To the point, I think it was unnecessary for E2 especially, and shifted the viewers focus off of what was E4/finale's most original and human moment and instead put it on the viewer's focus of the camera and cinematography. Keep the main thing the main thing imo.\n\n/End my \"Short Term 12 Does Not Need to be a Single Shot\" rant.",

That meant no invisible edits. Lewis confirmed with Variety, \u201cThere\u2019s no stitching of takes together. It was one entire shot, whether I wanted it to be or not.\u201d",

Even the more generic shows used to be better, IMO. The Pitt is a fine show, but it is nowhere near as endearing to me as ER was, for example. And there was also the whole slate of USA's Blue Sky programming. I don't know. TV used to be just so fun, but it feels like now I have to work to find something to enjoy.

I'm sure I'm a minority opinion but this is one of the worst looking TV shows I've ever seen in my entire life.\u00a0\u00a0  \n\nEvery scene is hampered by disgusting fish-eye lens distortion, chromatic aberration, vignette, and blurred edges. Fucking awful.  \n\nAll that background set design, costumes, lighting and make-up, completely ruined and blurred out *on purpose*.",
