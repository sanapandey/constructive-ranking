By numbers how many hit shows does each streamer have per year and how many do people think is enough to justify a subscription for a year. Like yeah understandably the cost is pissing everyone off. But how many shows or movies do they expect to have in a year that a worth watching. \n\nI\u2019m not talking just about who wins are awards. But how many a critically rated good and or the audience rate it well. \n\nBecause people constantly say why do people keep Netflix but by sheer numbers surely they are on top. Looking just at their kdramas. They release at least a dozen or maybe even 2 dozen well liked Korean dramas or movies per year. \n\nLike I\u2019m not shilling for any company I don\u2019t give a shit what people subscribe to. But some of the hyperbole I see at Netflix makes me wonder if I just have watched so little media or everyone has watched so much. Like I easily have more than 50+ movies and shows to watch on my Netflix watch list. A decent amount are Netflix originals like blue eye samurai or Babylon Berlin.",
