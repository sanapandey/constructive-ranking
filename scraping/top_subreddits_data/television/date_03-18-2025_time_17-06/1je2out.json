In the sense that it was a dynamic they had purposefully settled on.\n\nSo this way the higher ranking/employer/supervisor looks like a good guy who's there for the employees, and it's only because of those pesky rules out of his control that he has to be reminded to say no, or something to that effect.",

The ending payoff where he asks Michael \u201cam I gay?\u201d always cracks me up. And it was a great showcase of who the Andy Bernard character is. Throughout the show his identity is generally just whoever he needs to be for who he wants approval from (rooted in his issues from his parents, specifically his dad). It\u2019s a shame whatever happens to him in Season 8 and 9, but you could say that for almost the whole cast by that point.",

I think being around the parks gang, especially Leslie helped soften him and make him more tactful in the way he says things. His views are still the same, and he still focuses on fiscal responsibility, but he says it in a way that isn't assholish by the end. The Ben we see when he first shows up would never get elected, whereas later we see him getting elected to high office.",

So there was still likely that residual energy from that show, which also started off quite mean with Michael basically being a monster and Dwight being a true villain.\n\nLuckily they fixed this on P&R just like The Office - I wonder if for both, the showrunners and writers stepped back and thought \"what if these people were generally good people, that mostly liked each other, and got along in a truly sincere and heartwarming way?\"  \n\nPart of me feels the cultural angst at the time with the war, politics, and pending recession made them realize people didn't want to be bummed out even more.",

            "body": "To Scott's character - he never seemed like a \"dick\" but rather a guy who knows everyone hates him b/c of what he has to do.  So early on, it seems like he is a jerk but once more of his personality comes out - his character is clearly more than what he led on.\n\nAlso: Good writers realize and quickly are able to pivot away/towards a character design as they see it come alive.  Its been said that the arrival Lowe and Scott really did propel the show into a different tier in TV show history.  I think it definitely \"saved\" the show in a way.  Same can be said for Andy's character due to him originally being meant to be a villain/bad guy/one year character, but Pratt made him something different.",
