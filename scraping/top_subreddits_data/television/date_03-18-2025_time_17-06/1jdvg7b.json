            "body": "If this were a tough call to make, more Dems would have voted for it. From an optics standpoint, what Schumer did is mind boggling especially given how united the house was and reinforces the publics perception that Dems are divided/lack vision. The fact that zero concessions were obtained is another head scratcher. I guess doge wasnt enough of an existential threat to him to try and leverage the situation to rein it in. The only way Schumers actions make sense is that he wanted to avoid a blood bath on Wall Street/the stock market, which might have some merit but also lays clear, he has a very low pain tolerance and his biggest priority, are his donors",

That's a bit simplistic.\n\nNot that there isn't anything which makes a whole lot more sense.  There's certainly a plausible argument some people made that shuttering the government would just make the planned destruction of it easier - but the problem with that argument is _Democrats never really set it up._  They had months to see this coming and somehow got caught flat-flooted on their messaging, flailing and forced to backtrack.  Baffling.\n\nMy only tentative guess is that a couple senators flipped and the Schumer flipped to maintain the semblance that he has control of his caucus.",

Not everything \"Republican' is good. \n\nWhat you just described is many politicians, of every political stripe, and always has been.\n\nPew research studied bias in American politics two decades ago and found 85% of decisions favor the top 2% of earners. Studies since have found the same basic conclusion. That's regardless of who's in power.\n\nEqually, multiple studies have shown another stat at 85%: roughly the number of major issues the two sides  of voters agree on. And yet to look at Reddit, you'd have to assume America was a hellscape with no neutral ground and a wall down the middle keeping the two sides apart. \n\nOne might think studying the inefficacy of the American political system in actually representing voters might lead to trying to borrow more effective systems from other countries, nearly all of which have numerous other political biases agendas and affiliations, but no. \n\nAnd America, from a global perspective, is entirely right-wing. The Democrats and Republicans both exist to serve the dollar and whoever has most of it, and little else. That one side has thoroughly indoctrinated you to believe the other is evil is a sad statement, but it doesn't reflect reality.",

My point is that it is not really a popular issue.\n\nI live in miami and the DMV cant even get appointments right. The DMV is a mess and they spent $150 millon trying to fix it recently. Alot of people dont exactly have alot of faith in government employees managing things right. The government is wasteful to your everyday person. Think about that road is has been in repair for 3 years and its still not done. All the times you drive by and you like wow they still working on this. So online some issues seems popular and easy to push in society but in the real world critics are able to make valid points that make popular online issues problematic in the mainstream. Critics able to peel off support and create messaging choas. \n\nThey need to focus on the economy. Talk about fixing inflation. The problem is that american public blames biden for some of it. They just need time in my opinion to distance themselves from Biden and then focus in on the economy. Thats there winning message, the economy and prices. The polls showed that focusing on social stuff is not popular right now.",

I recommend writing a letter, something like:\n\n---\n\nWe have certain expectations of those we elect to represent us in Senate. And let it be clear, I'd rather a complete but temporary government shutdown than allow a facist-wannabe to impose an illegal set of impositions and permanently terminate the system. If the US needs to grind to a halt to prevent losing it's freedom and democracy, then I expect the politicians representing me pulling as hard as they can on the brakes. Senator Shumer failed to even do an attempt at effecitvely stopping the system.\n\nIf I am assigned a job, and I fail to do it, I am expected to lose my position. It doesn't matter if was due to moral opposition or being against the better judgement, it doesn't matter if it was due to thinking it would harm the employer more than it could benefit (this is the decision of the employer), it doensn't matter if it's due to corruption, or if they had their hands tied. If it was because they wouldn't or because they couldn't, it doesn't matter. The job wasn't done, and therefore the relationship is terminated. I am sure that Mr. Schumer would not find this unfair, given that they have no issue with government employees who were doing their job well still get fired simply because it was politically convenient.\n\nThis letter is simply a statement of effect. Barring a very drastic change in behavior, this will be noted in 2028, and I will vote on the primaries for Senate accordingly.\n\n---\n\nAnd then you *mean it*. Democrats have failed us, badly. When Republicans tried to rein in Trump, trumpers simply elected new representatives that would support Trump. Meanwhile we kept the same Democrats that refused to stop Trump because we hoped they'd change. They haven't, and they won't. So it's time we play the same game: we'll simply replace it with democrats that will not let Trump keep getting away with it, and that then will do nothing to undo the harm he's done, just try to fix things \"just enough\" so that Trump suffers no consequence, and yet has his changes permanently kept. Neither Biden, nor many Democrats in Congress ever rolled out tax hikes on the rich, they never undid the worst harms Trump did on police policy, immigration, Israel/Palestine, Russia power-grabbing, accountability for Jan 6. When Trump came to power in 2025 he found that everything he did was still there and he could keep his progress going, the only thing that changed was that things were fixed \"just enough\" that he didn't have to do anything about it. Clearly this politicians are not up to the job, so we should replace them with politicians that will. And if they don't, we send them a letter and elect someone else. Eventually someone will platform on it simply because they'll realize it'll guarantee them getting elected. And eventually someone will actually do things about it because they'll realize it's the only way to get some extra terms.\n\nSo come the next elections in 2026 register as a Democrat. Then if your representative even budged an inch to allow facism to take hold, if they even flinched, send them a letter making it clear it's not personal: they just aren't a good match for the job; and then elect someone else in the primaries to run, and make it clear that you elected them expecting them to actually work. And keep it going. You are tired of Democrats not doing their job? Fire their ass at the primaries, get someone who will work.",

It agrees with the framing of the far right instead of challenging it.\n- Talks a big game about capitalism\u2019s flaws but still trusts billionaires like Mark Cuban to fix things instead of pushing real alternatives.  \n- Criticizes the Democratic Party for being incoherent but does the same thing by platforming both progressives and reactionaries without a clear stance.  \n- Plays it too safe\u2014treats politics like a debate club instead of recognizing real dangers and calling them out directly.  \n- Uses comedy as a shield to downplay how bad things actually are, making everything seem like just another silly political moment.  \n\nLast Week Tonight is better because it actually explains systemic issues instead of just pointing out hypocrisy, giving viewers a better understanding of why problems exist.

And then all of the voters they already had just spout about how it's over, Trump can't win, blah blah blah. And are just left speechless after. The Dems need to make a push for voters they did not have before.",

For example, he didn\u2019t point out that if the government shuts down, the current administration will have wide latitude to decide which departments get prorogued and which are \u201cessential\u201d. They will use it as an excuse to gut exactly the people they already want to gut. The segment also forgot to mention that shutting down the government is extremely unpopular with voters, and even the Republicans cave every single time when they\u2019re in this situation, because it just isn\u2019t feasible to be the party who shut down US government. They would pay a huge penalty, and instead of Trump\u2019s popularity tanking, theirs would. Schumer\u2019s strategy here is clearly to make Trump and Repubs own these spending cuts and suffer the consequences.

Instead of waiting for every single perspective to perfectly align with our own vision, we need to rally around a core set of priorities. Not every opinion should have equal weight, especially if endless debate opens the door for our opponents to advance their agenda unchecked.\n\nIt\u2019s true that some voices in this discussion seem more interested in critiquing than in building consensus. However, practical progress requires that we come together on the most critical issues first, setting aside less vital disagreements for later discussion. Genuine leadership means distilling diverse ideas into a unified plan that moves us forward, rather than allowing internal discord to fuel a cycle of pessimism. By focusing on real unity and decisive action, we can work against the very forces that threaten to leave us divided and vulnerable. We need to find and promote a real leader to run the Democrat party and to have a real opposition force.",

Because comparably he should have been fairly dominant in 2020 and while he was one of the stronger candidates, he didn't come close to his 2016 support. Now could Warren have dropped out sooner and backed him? Yes and that could have been a difference maker but I don't think it would have been enough to actually win.\n\nI think the real issue is that after 2016 and Bernie's popularity in the party they didn't look at their stances on issues and shift to where the electorate is. Trump's rise is largely driven in my opinion by voters that feel the status quo is not working for them and they're getting fucked. And given how aggressively the wealth is shifting up, it's not misplaced. There's other issues at play too but burying their heads in the sands on real issues affecting people does not help and it's absolutely something they should be able to message.",

One of the tools that they have very purposely held on to is the 60 vote threshold to reach cloture and break a filibuster. It is arbitrary but they have kept it around. When they have had a simple majority but not the 60 vote threshold, they have refused to get rid of it. This has prevented them from passing the legislation that otherwise would have majority support.\n\nThey have held onto this, saying that it is an important tool. If they aren't going to actually use this important tool, we could have passed a shit-ton more stuff.\n\nThey love to play with one hand tied behind their back. Normal people don't give a shit about what the parliamentarian (who the leadership appoints) says. They don't care about the rules the senate majority decides to inflict on itself.

People have died because they fell victim to the violent criminals Trump blanket pardoned _who went on to commit more violent crimes._  Trans people are increasingly dying to suicide due to Trump's pointed persecution of them (though in many cases, this is more related to state laws that are being passed in response to Trump's hateful agenda).  Vets are dying or developing worsening diseases because of Trump's gutting of the VA.\n\nIf we want to go beyond death to plain old \"substantial harm\" (which I think is a good enough bar - note that I'm not the person who raised death), legal immigrants are being thrown into Guantanamo and deported with zero evidence of having committed crimes.  Students are being deported (or otherwise disappeared) for peaceful protests they attended _a year ago_.  Former federal employees are losing their livelihoods (and many are killing themselves) because Trump's admin has made it their mission to make their lives hell.  People are spreading entitely preventable, life altering diseases like measles because Trump categorically refuses to deal with them in any way and is actively dismantling the organizations that do.  Law firms are being targeted for being involved in one of the many, _many_ lawsuits against Trump.  Medical facilities are being targeted because they follow scientifically robust standards of care that Trump decided didn't align with his Christian nationalist agenda.\n\nBut people online have called you out for your brazen, seemingly proud disregard for human life, so they're your enemy now, because you felt insulted.\n\nWhy should you care?  If you had empathy, you wouldn't need to be told to care about the most powerful government in the world intentionally harming it's citizens.\n\nIf the only thing you care about is being undisturbed, then assuming you're not one of the minorities Trump is targeting, you're right.  You have no reason to care about the suffering being inflicted by an administration that is actively hostile towards it's own citizens, at least for now.  Maybe you'll even be insulated from the economic consequences of the damage he's causing - I imagine hospitals will be in higher demand as the consequences of his policies are felt more broadly.\n\nAt least, you have no reason to care _until they find a reason to come after you_.

Kamala or Walz say platitudes like we\u2019ve got to keep the fight going guys we can\u2019t give up or they barely admit that maybe their campaign strategies could have been a little better. How about if they told the voters they were gonna get universal healthcare, lower the cost of drugs, raise minimum wage, legalize marijuana, get better gun laws and stuff like that, maybe they would have won with a message like that.
