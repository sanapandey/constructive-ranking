Foreshadowing where watchers can be excited about their theories coming true is great, *especially* when people are on the right track but sensible curveballs throw it slightly off-track just builds more hype to know what *else* is coming.\n\nMaking everything impossible to predict means no clever foreshadowing, shit happening at random, and hoping people feel connected to something they were excluded from feeling smart about. Passive watching with reactions of \"ooo wat dat\" as opposed to passionate whiteboard theories.",

Its extremely fucked, not for kids and not remotely like Severance.  Probably the best episode of the series and not the one you should start with honestly.  I wouldn't start with the pilot either because it has some beastility. So if you want to take the plunge I would start with Season 1 and pick either Episode 2 or 3.  Episode 3 is much more Black Mirror but they are both fantastic. Just view the series as a collection of vaguely connected movies.  Essentially they take a piece of our current technology and ramp it up past 100 and then present that world to us.  Like for example, if you could recall every single thing you have ever done via a device in your head.  How would that world work?  What would change?",

His perspectives on justice were interesting.\n\nFirst, he said it wasn\u2019t fair because she probably didn\u2019t do it. He said it would have been more fair that the boyfriend was punished that way since he did it.\n\nSo I said, yeah but assume she is guilty. Then is it a good punishment for her. He said yes.\n\nThen at the very end when he found out they were going to do it to her over and over again, he was horrified. Has some interesting conversation about it.\n\nHe\u2019s been begging to watch Black Mirror for years but we\u2019ve only let him watch a few choice episodes here or there. San Junipero/miley Cyrus episode/social credit episode. White Bear was definitely his first really dark episode.",

Don't @ me you trolls.
