The Harley Quinn team has already talked up ideas for a season 6, that would return to Gotham, so it doesn't seem like Season 5 is meant to wrap it up. \n\nThe Vampire Diaries had The Originals run alongside it (with Legacies launching after its final season) and Supernatural tried a couple times during the show, before The Winchesters launched after a final conclusive season. \n\nThis is the quote, and the guy's also the one running Creature Commandos for DC/MAX as well. \n\n>Dean Lorey: Well, I'm all in on the Harleyverse. There's a show that I am hoping to be able to announce somewhat soon, that is in the Harleyverse that I'm very excited about.
