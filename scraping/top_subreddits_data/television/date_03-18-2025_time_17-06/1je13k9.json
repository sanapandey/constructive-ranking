This should have been 90% written by now and filming just about beginning. \n\nI can\u2019t even fault Apple on this one, Silo was filming 3 as 2 was airing and we\u2019ll get that season this year",

If they can finish the writing, they can\u2019t finish the filming by March-ish of next year to wrap the outdoor scenes. \n\nBasically they will need to secure all of their sets, crew, and production equipment (including rented/leased extremely high quality cameras + operators). They will then need to secure their cast for three filming windows. First will be indoor/set filming, second will be outdoor filming, and third will be indoor/outdoor reshoots. \n\nThis means that they would need to start filming by at least September or October of any given year, then film outdoor scenes in January, then reshoot in March because of their snowy setting. Keep in mind, days are very short in this winter in Newfoundland and getting equipment/crews around the snowy parts is a logistical nightmare. \n\nThey would have to wrap writing and finalize a script by like May at the latest to make it work - all assuming they don\u2019t have actors with other contractual obligations. \n\nProbably not going to happen, so they will film in 2026 and release mid 2027 if I had to guess. It\u2019s possible to get a 2025 filming and 2026 release but unlikely.",

These things can still happen.\n\nSo this annoying trend of longer breaks is just poor management imho\n\nAnd I know the argument will always be \u201cwell good art takes time\u201d well in my blunt honest opinion, S2 of Severence has not been worth the wait.\n\nAnywho, just throwing out opinions to random people on the internet!",

TV mostly sucks dick these days lets be honest. The Severance people at least put some thought into their craft. It's a well done series and s2 levelled up in storytelling. \n\nAnd what does it mean, not worth the wait? You didnt wait in line for something. You watched some TV and then couldnt continue to watch for a few years. Was the sorrow of that gap too hard to bear lol, you were. better off not watching and not feeling that gap?",

The Sopranos, The Wire, Rome, True Detective, White Lotus, Succession, The Leftovers, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Veep, Barry, Six Feet Under, Silicon Valley, Big Little Lies, almost all of their big shows have been allowed to take over a year off when they wanted to.

Which is good, because episode 2 already aired by the time they're writing it. The writer of episode 17 also doesn't need to worry about what the writers of episode 16 and 15 and 18 are doing, which is good because they're all writing independently at the same time, and their scripts are due in a week. The writers get together at the beginning of the season and come up with story ideas and maybe basic outlines for each episode and an idea of where characters are going, and then divide up the assignments and write. And when they have a few scripts done, it's time to start filming. And when they have a few episodes filmed, it's time to start airing them. \n\nThe writer of Severance episode 5 needs to know *exactly* what happens in episode 2. And 4. and 8. If they're just making it up as they go, that will necessitate rewrites in episodes before and after. So before they can split up writing assignments, they have a *detailed* breakdown of what's going to happen in every episode, so that the writer of episode 5 knows exactly what's already happened and what will happen, so they don't contradict the past, and so they set things up for the future. That takes time. And even after they've all finished drafts, they need to put everything together and go through it with a fine-toothed comb to make sure all the details match up. \n\nTwo things worth pointing out:\n\n1. The writing taking a long time prevents them from being on a set annual schedule like TNG or L&O. And that creates additional delays. You don't know when you're going to start filming, so you can't have your cast or your crew or your studio space reserved for a specific time. When the scripts are done and you're ready to start filming, *then* you start looking to schedule, and some people might be tied up for months and months before you can actually start. \n2. I love a lot of shows that did 20+ episode seasons. And I don't want them to die. For whatever reason, 20+ episode seasons now are almost entirely reserved for L&O/NCIS/FBI/Chicago type shows, and nothing with any ambition at all does the kind of format that could do them. I would absolutely *love* a Star Trek show to go back to lower budget, less serialized, long annual seasons. But the streaming services seem to only want the serialized stuff, even though I'm sure they see a lot of viewers still watching old Star Trek or West Wing or Supernatural or whatever, but they have no interest in making them.",

The long seasons made money by the episode. New short seasons keep people subscribed by the season.\n\nAlso modern series tend to be non-episodic. Stories already feel stretched with 8-12 episodes telling a single big story, so they keep seasons to mostly 8-10.\n\nSure, big story seasons need more access to other episodes, but Buddy seasons still had references spanning 2-3 seasons. Good writing rooms managed to tell episodic stories with seasonal super-stories.\n\nAnd Severance isn't the best example for your argument. Great series, but not that much is happening per episode. Plus, we're not talking 70s here, modern writers have trivial access to computers with any kind of database and text indexing they want. Nowadays even AI. So accessing scenes in either text or video form is fairly easy. Making the management of storylines across episodes much easier than it would have been if everything is just stacks of paper.\n\nYes. I agree well made modern series need good writers doing quality work. And no doubt that's harder than quickly dumping out the script for next week's episode back in the 90s.\n\nBut I'm still not buying that this is the reason we had long pauses in recent years. It's more to do with a pandemic, writers strike and more big movie actors playing in prestige shows that come with scheduling conflicts. In between seasons they do a movie or 2.",

Example:  My ex's name was Marina Maldonado.  I used her name in an episode of The Shield and two episodes of House MD because the actual \"Showrunners\" of the episode had posted onto craigslist for \"proofreading\" gigs and I took those gigs and made $50 off of them.  $160 total because I over-exaggerated Paypal fees.  They got to work their server jobs at Applebee's and I helped make them $100 overhead total.\n\nScreenwriters can outsource their jobs, but above that, production-wise?  All I can give you is an old adage:  You can get a job done right, fast, and cheap:  Pick two.\n\nThey're not choosing, \"fast\", in this scenario.\n\nedit:  1 downvote = 1 missing persons report that will never ever be followed up upon.

Cobel\u2019s story could have been more spaced out like other plots, and we didnt need an entire episode for that one big piece of info at the end.  It moves the main plotline quickly at some point in time and then completely halts it.  And then the last episode it barely moves. No build to the end. Dylan and irv\u2019s story , while interesting, are separate from the rest of the show. Milcheck does start on the fuck lumon path so thats cool.  The other thing is that it is in a contrast to season one where every episode had some significant progress or development.",

What happens with a lot of shows is that they put a lot of thought leading into season 1 (years), they kind of sculpt and mold it to have a satisfying ending. But they don't do the same for S1+, I think the problem with WestWorld post S1 (which I actually put up there with one of the best seasons of all time), is that it's not as well crafted to come to a satisfying meaningful conclusion and feels rushed.\n\nBut the themes of S3-4 I think had a lot of intrigue and production value, but they just didn't stick the landing as well as they should have. I think you always need to think of the ending before the beginning and then develop a path which to get there.\n\nI think this is why a lot of more successful multi-movie projects comes more from book series than hollywood writers, there's a different expectation there on a book series than tv shows/movies.",

I feel many negative feelings just lie in doing 2 backstory episodes in a row.  Combine that with the show widening its scope.  It's no longer just about outie Mark and the innies.  It's now following outie Irv, Helena, and outie Dylan and his family.  \nSo the show hasn't been as economical when it's moving more storylines in contrast to just Mark last year.  The backstory eps didn't help in this regard as the show was juggling everything pretty fine until them.  Now there's suddenly 1 episode left and some storylines haven't advanced much in the backhalf.  \nPeople can like or hate the Cobel episode.  I liked it but I understand people looking at the clock for remaining time in the season and getting a bit nervous.  But this subreddit also seems to hate season ending cliffhangers or storylines that extend past 1 season, so I'm sure the finale will bring the hate train.  Hell, there were a ton of people who held a grudge at the excellent \"She's alive\" cliffhanger here.",

If one is not David Lynch, dream scenes can often feel so rote and formulaic, and something of a bad crutch. \n\nOther issues, as I see it:\n\n* Removing Helly -- the show's life-force character/agent of change/\"hellion\" -- for so long was a mistake. She's pretty much the heart of the series, along with Mark.  \n\n* It's something of a missed opportunity that the show's best actor (Jen Tullock) plays the doting sister who occasionally appears in decent or forgettable scenes.\n\n* Saw someone else say this, and it might be accurate: The show assumes the audience, generally speaking, finds Cobel's character extremely interesting; in reality, that may not be the case. \n\n*  I don't buy Mark and Gemma's bond at all. No strong chemistry, no spark there (this problem does not exist with Mark and Helly). While that \"Chikhai Bardo\" episode was well-directed, it sort of reminded me of certain grade school Bristol board presentations that were slim on research but heavy on decorations, with the borders outlined in expensive Crayola markers and stickers aplenty. We need to actually get to *know* Mark and Gemma in a straightforward episode (rather than an artfully edited one where we barely discern that, apparently, these two -- for some reason -- like each other).  \n\n* The characters have sometimes been made to fit the plot, rather than the other way around. After Irving was \"killed\" by Milchick, the core crew that we had come to know would have protested much more vigorously. They would have refused to work until Irving was restored to the floor. So I didn't buy the (almost) cavalier reaction, and the sense of resignation. (Nor did I think that aftermath episode properly addressed the revelation that Helly had been secretly replaced by Helena. Even Helly's own reaction was sidelined for that whole episode.) \n\n* They keep recycling emotional beats and cliffhangers in a wheel-spinning way. I don't get how there wasn't a sense of deja vu in the writer's room. Multiple episodes have ended with a shot of Mark crying and thinking of Gemma, and multiple episodes have ended using a cliffhanger that basically amounts to \"He's reintegrating! *Right now*! It's not like with Petey -- new method; it's gonna happen *fast*!\" But then the next episode begins and it's like, Mark takes a nap instead, or he artificially freaks out so the plot can stall for time and he can eat Chinese food.",

Severance takes a few cues from Twin Peaks imo, and that show was always about what Lynch called chasing a \u201cgolden goose.\u201d As in, that show was never truly about the death of Laura Palmer and the mystery of who killed her; it was about all the questions her death raised and all the world building it caused. \n\nTo me, Severance is no different. It\u2019s not truly about what Lumon is doing or what the story is logically building to; it\u2019s about the characters and the confusion they\u2019re feeling/the mystery itself. These pace breaker episodes don\u2019t exist as filler to me because they enhance that sense of confusion/anxiousness to find out what happens next.
