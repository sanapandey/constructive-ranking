IMO, what is really unsatisfying about the whole thing is not that we don't know the answer, but that there really isn't one.\n\nIt's the kind of thing that David Lynch might have done: Here is this weird thing that doesn't really make sense, and he isn't going to explain it to you, and maybe he himself doesn't quite know what it is. But that works for his type of surrealism, whereas here it doesn't.",
