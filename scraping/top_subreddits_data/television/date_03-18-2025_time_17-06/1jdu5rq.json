It's one thing to show Midge repeatedly blowing up her own life, but another entirely for us to be expected still to be in her corner when she keeps disregarding other people like that. \n\nHad watched _Gilmore Girls_ all the way to the end, and rewatched it many times right up until the revival miniseries made me realize how selfish and overrated both main characters were, and that this didn't represent a change for either of them: they'd been that way the whole time without our realizing it.

He also constantly aquires things, and after that one situation he made all his friends sort of rich in the ways they need and got a year of unlimited bus travel.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, any dude like that can make quick cash, even when he's undercover he sometimes gets paid to do jobs etc. The biggest question in that show is that he supposedly has a 13 year pension. Regular military needs 20 years, spec ops 16.\u00a0\n\n\nSo wtf is a 13 year pension? He doesn't seem to be claiming VA disability pension.\u00a0\n\n\nIf it's a bad fictional version of the sepc ops pension, he was a major, so his pension is probably like 2,500/month or so. More if it's magically a full pension.\u00a0\n\n\nTo put it in perspective a full 20\u00a0 year normal military pension for a Major is using current pay would be about 5K/month. I can't remember if they take a hit if the spec ops retire at 16, but even if they do, that's probably still somewhere around 4K.\u00a0\n\n\nSo if he got some special early out and we assume a 1:1 break down a standard 20 year is 50%. So 2.5% per year.\u00a0\n\n\n13 years would be 32.5% (I'm not 100% sure that is how it would play out since I never heard of a 13 year).\u00a0\n\n\n10K x 32.5% = $3,250/month.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you assume that pensions grow slightly slower than wages and he's been retired for a number of years, then in terms of 2025 money, his pension might be something more like $2,900 - $3,100\u00a0\n\n\nThen you do apparently get anal raped by the government, because if you get a pension before you're old, they add a \"you're young so fuck you\" tax on it. So he loses a bit more than a normal person on his taxes.\u00a0",

Idk if TERA can be earlier for spec ops since there isn't a easy search for their special retirement status.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter a lazy search it's a 1% penalty for each sub 20 year. Idk if that holds for spec ops.\u00a0\n\n\nTwo possibilities in that regard would be -7% for the 20 basis, or -3% for a 16 basis.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, there used to be a non-va disability pension, straight mil. Which someone could have pencil whipped for him given his unique situation.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, if he was a simple man, he could be living off TSP.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd the story is likely quite simplified given his dad was an officer making bank, and not shown to be a hellcat at 50% interest kind of military guy.

I didn't pick up on it at all on my first run through the show when I was younger, and on my later viewing I was able to tune out the slight quirks. But supposedly this was a show with a TON of takes because she kept slipping back into her Australian accent and they'd have to yell cut. And yet despite all the takes they liked her enough to not only keep her on the show for five seasons, but also give her a second role on the show.\n\nI think it's a worthwhile show if you can get past it. John Noble is consistently astounding in it.\n\nShe had an appearance in the first season of The Last of Us, and on that show I was often like \"yeah that line needed another take, you sound Australian\". I thought she performed well but the accent was way off.",

Instead of covering all that, Jake carves his name in a tree or some shit. Lame and inconsequential.",

Not sure how to explain it.\n\nSwiss army knife character something something.\n\nThe literal above is all done ***in the very first episode***. If they spread it out it certainly wouldn't have been as bad.\n\nBTW parts of this were censored in China. This was produced by a Chinese company, based on a game developed by a Chinese game company. IE, it was blatant pandering because if they meant it and really want that character to be that way they wouldn't censor the stuff in China. So yea. Pandering.\n\nThey changed elements of the story. Like the main bad guy is supposed to be a mad scientist. Instead they made him a priest. Probably to check the \"religion is evil checkbox\" or something.\n\nOn top of that IIRC they killed the ENDGAME BOSS in the second fucking episode.\n\nAnd it's poorly written on top of that to boot. Like I could get over the check boxing but usually they do that when the writing is fucking terrible.\n\nLike people can't write LGBTQ or PoC characters without Mary suing them to death far more often than not, or they feel like just an insert on the side.\n\nFor all mankind did it right. They wrote the struggles and it was a great part of their character development. We get to see who they are as a person beyond \"oh yea btw this person is XYZ\"\n\nCastlevania? Issac is SUPPOSED to be white apparently but he was so fucking goddamn cool NOT being white. AND I ONLY FOUND THAT OUT AFTER TALKING TO A FAN of the games.

To do that he needed access to the home & walk around freely. So, he decides to start dating the man\u2019s daughter (Greta?).\n\nShe\u2019s just normal person, working a waitressing job. Pretty, is nice & a little self conscious & shy. At least what we can tell. There\u2019s a scene that we see her father is a tool. Her mother basically lets him be a tool.\n\nHe says some awful things to his daughter & says outright why is the prince dating Greta, she\u2019s nothing special. Liam defends her saying he finds her very special.\n\nComments later just prove that the father was likely emotionally & verbally abusive to Greta growing up & shattered her self esteem. I just felt bad for her. \n\nThey date for a month. Then he gets caught & Greta finds out the truth. They break up!<\n\nThat\u2019s it. We don\u2019t hear about her ever again & like an episode later Liam is dating someone new. (His main love interests look nearly identical btw lol)\n\nIt made me irrationally angry & even though it was near the end of the series I turned it off. It was about a year later I decided to finish in case they did something with that plot but they never did.\n\nI wanted to see her hanging out with a friend on vacation & having fun. It just made it feel like she was so beaten down by her dad she was tired & needed a little support & Liam just kicked her in the stomach, leaving her broken.\n\nIt made me hate the father, hate Liam & the show.",

Same people that idolize Michael Douglas' character in falling down.  Your not supposed to aspire to be these psychos, you're supposed to see that they are insane and society drove them insane.  Do you really want to be the weak minded man that goes on a murdering spree when life gets a little tough?  I loved these movies too, but I took away a different message i guess.  Now we have John Wick movies where he murders hundreds and hundreds of men because his dog got killed and he is unironically the hero.  Good cinematography, but is the film trying to say anything that adds value to the way you look at the world?  At least the other films had a message, just too bad nobody seems to get it anymore.  But yeah, fuck Christian Bales snobby lisp, he almost ruined the Batman series, thank god they always had better actors supporting the script.",
