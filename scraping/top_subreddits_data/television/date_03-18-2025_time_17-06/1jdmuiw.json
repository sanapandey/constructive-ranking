I quit *The Bear* one episode in because I work in a kitchen. \n\nWhat other professions are compelling enough to deserve this treatment? And what aren't? There's a million cop shows, but I'm guessing there's a reason I can't think of any cop shows that focus on day-in-the-life (or maybe I'm wrong?)",

Mountains of doc review, low-level motions, navigating firm politics, existing at the beck and call of partners and clients, desperately working your network to land a client only for it to get gobbled up by the firm, etc.",

Kim obviously enjoyed doing public defense work for a lot of reasons, but I always got the impression that one of those reasons is that she had a clear preference for litigation. She seemed to thrive while cross examining witnesses and pressuring prosecutors into deals, but came to resent the drudgery of the banking work that she relied on for a paycheck for the majority of the show.",

Mike comes into work one day and gets told that trial or some big motion on a case he\u2019s never heard of is next week and he needs to get the smoking gun evidence asap. No one conducts discovery (other than these weird depositions where the asking attorney spends the whole time monologuing and not getting any valuable testimony from the witness) and instead they spend all their time walking into each others offices, dropping a folder containing some evidence, and saying some form of \u201ccheckmate.\u201d And then the case is just resolved. It\u2019s pretty funny.\u00a0",

Also love the constant jabs at the press shop, because they are mostly useless, and I've definitely worked with a few Mike McClintocks. \n\nBut at least the Hill has some level of respectability. Where dreams really go to die is for staffers who are stuck running the gauntlet on local campaigns and can never break into the federal races or anything more serious. That's where you find some of the most miserable staffers who have resigned themselves to knocking doors for the local dog catcher, cycle after cycle, and will absolutely make your life miserable if you have to work with them on something.

The first season is a regular corp contract but it ends with the company who contracted going bankrupt and the building never being finished.\n\nThe second season is about doing a government project but they get so frustrated from all the red-tape that they literally can't work and end up \"going rogue\" and building for free to help finish a community centre - which causes them to have to go to court and to temporarily suspend all the workers.\n\nSeason three is we see their home lives outside of work and how some are easy to move on but many - construction is all they've known. So they end up starting their own company while the court case works itself out. \n\nSeason four is starting their own business and all the trials and tribulations that come with that.\n\nAnd the final season is them dealing with old bosses, the government and how their latest project gets picketed for gentrifying an area. \n\nAnyway, so that's my pitch.

One memory that sticks out is that my dad couldn\u2019t go to a job site we were working on because he had to go to another, so I got a ride with some construction worker. 6am I asked him what he packed for lunch since his cooler was at my feet and he responded \u201ca 6er\u201d. No joke, it was a 6 pack. Now that\u2019s not everyone. People in trades work their asses off. But there are a lot of people like that. There is so much room for comedy and ups and downs for drama. My dad, for example, was the electrical head of a company that made actual millions installing EZ pass in my state (automatic toll booth sensors) and saw none of it. Went off on his own. Does well for himself. We live in a pretty touristy area so he has worked in quite a few celebrities vacation homes and they offer him the most obscure shit (drugs included, or for something more light hearted classic arcade machines that just need to be rewired or giving him a space key to use their Maserati whenever they aren\u2019t home). Could just write his story as a comedy and probably a million others just like him. Or just make each episode its own construction site with the lead being the foreman. This is a great premise.",

But even the people who use libraries the most, or who volunteer to serve on Library boards, don\u2019t necessarily know the difference between a library page, clerk, librarian, and Library assistant, or public services from technical services and other specialized functions. Most people just know the one or two services that they use, and don't keep track of all of the things we get involved with.

It has funny scenes, it has heartwarming scenes, it even has optimistic scenes (see: S2E7, Forks). And by definition that makes it a comedy, or a dramedy if you really want to nitpick. The inclusion of intense and serious scenes does not detract from it being a comedy, it just means it is *also* a drama. It's like Shakespeare--Romeo and Juliet is a tragicomedy which means it mixes tragic and comic elements. Why can't The Bear be classified as a dramedy then?",

Send them for a while month and it's two stars.\n\nMaybe for 3 stars they need to do a full team episode at the French Laundry and the sprit of the spring pollon will enter the nasal glands of every cook and they'll be on a single symbiotic page plating like some culinary version of the Proto molecule.",

He and my uncle had worked together for 20 years and I started washing dishes before I became the fry bitch. It was a Friday night fish fry and he was very particular about plating. Oval plate, fries across 4/5 of it. Empty space wad left for a lemon twist and tartar cup. 5 pieces of perch, arched over the top of the fries in a line. Well, I put the plate in the window and didn't notice the middle piece fall into another piece so instead of being ( I I I I I ) it was ( I I  III). He pushed it out of the window and it exploded on the floor. I was like \"uh...?\" and he goes \"Do it right, if you fuck it up again I'll find someone else\".\n\nAnother time we had just finished the dinner rush and he went to grab a plate off the stack and got 2 because (his nephew) the dishwasher hadn't cleaned the back of the plate and he immediately whipped them at the wall, like 6in from the kids head, were they exploded into bits and he said \"Are you fucking retarded? You can't even wash fucking dishes? You're mom should have aborted you!\"\n\nI mean, I worked in a handful of kitchens after that and they weren't bad, way more laid back. That first place was def a little more higher end than the sports bars I went to after and I didn't encounter that shit again but that dude was legit toxic af during work hours.

It's not a perfect portrayal, but it's a lot closer to the dealmaking, glad-handing, and general stupidity of working at higher levels of American government than West Wing ever was. West Wing had this tendency to get preachy and soap-boxy in a way that behind-the-scenes government never is, although I think we Americans like to think our higher-level officials just go around wearing their ideals on their sleeves and making meaningful speeches where a whole room of people just stop and listen to one person talking.\n\nIt's also an amazing portrayal of all of those people you never see and probably aren't aware even exist, the speech writers, the assistants, the handlers, etc, etc. I don't often work directly with politicians themselves but, I do work with their support staff, and the amount of crazy stress and work they're doing to get these people where they need to be just to say one thing or very briefly meet one person is Amy and Dan levels of crazy.",

These people could be doing anything, it's just that the \"theme\" of their office is politics. None of those staffers have special knowledge or advanced degrees. Most are young and in their 20s and 30s, being given jobs they have no business doing. The reason why Veep is so good is because it captures how unserious the work actually is. Most of what you're doing is not actually that complicated. Because the US doesn't have a real civil service, the staffers are all political hires who may follow their boss through their career. So, you get the sort of people who ride the coattails of others, and the show does a good jobs of showing that in the different personalities on the staff. I've worked for Amys and Dans, and about every comms guy is a version of Mike McLintock. \n\nSomething that I think Veep touches on but never quite nails is the weirdness of staffing a campaign. That area is ripe for satire, but the public is even less aware of that aspect of politics as they are the \"official side.\" Campaigns are the wild west, and almost anything goes. I'm honestly surprised the media doesn't cover this drama more. That's the one part of American politics that isn't represented quite right in popular media, and there are tons of stories to tell.",

I genuinely enjoyed the humdrum office dramas and storylines in the Office (US and UK) even without the wackier/less realistic storylines, and early seasons of *Archer* also had their share of office admin jokes, which juxtaposed beautifully with the fact it was a James Bond spy parody. A third example I could throw out is *Mad Men* - an advertising agency isn\u2019t exactly my idea of a thrilling setting, but the show made it work\u2026 and *withouf* resorting to silly melodrama storylines like \u201cTERRORISTS HOLD THE OFFICE HOSTAGE.\u201d\n\nThe reason you don\u2019t get much \u201csay in the life\u201d, in my opinion, is that it is so much harder to write good human drama than it is to write something viscerally exciting like action. I admire the crap out of the series that can do this.\n\n\nI would love to see a series that is this, but on a construction site. Maybe every season covers one project, and you get a bunch of character drama, egos and life events against a backdrop of deadlines to keep the project on track and within budget.\u00a0",

The average person has no fucking clue what we do, how it's made, how badly we're sometimes treated, or the BS we deal with all the time. We get so many complaints about bad VFX/CG (some criticism is legit but more often than not is caused by dumb higher up decisions that positioned us to fail) and we rarely get praise because the viewer never even knew the good work we did was there. Imagine the better job you do the less likely your work is noticed. The disrespect from so much of the audience and even our clients (the big movie studios) is so insane that they now try to hide blue/greenscreens in behind the scenes footage to make it seem like there was no or less VFX than there actually was (happened in Barbie). All this when they've relied so much on our work to get seats filled in theaters the past few decades. So much of our work's existence is minimized, ignored, lied by omission to not exist in marketing. It is infuriating. Over the years we've increasingly been refused the ability to show before and afters when presenting our work in personal portfolios because the big movie studios don't want people to see how certain things were made. If the company we work for is lucky they will be allowed to show some in the company portfolio. One can't help but feel these increased restrictions are just another step in the anti-VFX train / VFX denialism.\n\nIf people are interested check out this 4 part video series on youtube called \"No CGI Is Really Just Invisible CGI\" that goes into this including Barbie hiding the blue/greenscreens in BTS fotoage and Top Gun 2 pretending all the jets were real.",

Most people aren't saving lives or tradings millions, but they ARE working for small-time rich asshole bosses trying to keep their place of business afloat despite the chaos and greed of their owners.

Not quite a single shot, but it's setup as one long continuous scene that had me on the edge of my seat. Very anxiety inducing a la The Bear. \n\nOutside of the horrific series of events (that actually happened) it was really cool to see how much effort went into analog production on the fly, vs how much easier it is now digitally. Also, the first global broadcast ever done on a remote scale like that.",

At one point one of the interns opened up a computer in the middle of the OR with a patient cracked open. One that would never happen, if it's not working to that point it's called off or moved to another OR. Most of the scopes and stuff like that are on a cart that is mobile etc. but it's definitely not sterile to do that in that room.  \n\nI love the Pitt, but there was one little blip where he was like just delete your record from the patient chart. Uh no that's not how that works it goes through a special department for review and action.",
