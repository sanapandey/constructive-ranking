It's the exact issue with trying to explain the force with midichlorians, or the origin of the Reapers in Mass Effect. It doesn't work.\n\nAnd it retcons the source of bending by making it about the lion turtles (and no, trying to bend and twist the knowledge we have to try and make it fit instead of accepting it as a retcon is simply trying to do the work that the writers failed to do and I'm tired of fanbases making excuses for bad/ inconsistent writing in that way).",

It's just really messy overall, would've probs lychee better if they'd given them all 4 from the start.\n\nBut when they new they had two seasons for 3 and 4 it slapped!
