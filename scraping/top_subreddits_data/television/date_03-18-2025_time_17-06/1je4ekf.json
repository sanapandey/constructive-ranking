Lol.\n\n\nMaybe it's been a long time since you watched The Wire, but I keep The Wire, Sopranos, Seinfeld, and Peaky Blinders on a background rotation pretty much all year.\u00a0\n\n\nBodie, 100,000% wanted Wallace killed and two scenes in particular confirm this.\u00a0\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TfnSzfNZUAc?si=Se3Dw2A8U1kz6_8Z\nhttps://youtu.be/uf5Wv4AvN7s?si=7sk5I-YCv81e00rb\n\n\nBodie only sought out reasons to discredit Wallace, and when given an opportunity to speak up for him and save his life with Stringer, he decided to talk down on Wallace, pretty much sealing Wallace's fate.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd remember, nobody had proof Wallace snitched. It was only speculation and Bodie still thought he deserved to die.\u00a0\n\n\nFast forward to the Little Kevin situation. Little Kevin, talked to the cops and didn't snitch to them but snitched to Randy. And unlike Wallace EVERYONE knew Little Kevin at least spoke with the police.\u00a0\n\n\nSo at the point where Bodie was ready to take the stand to avenge the death of Little Kevin, I saw Bodie as the ultimate hypocrite. And was not bothered at all when he got gunned down. He's cool with all the senseless murders, one which he participated in....until it directly affected him?!?!?\u00a0\n\n\nBecause for me as a viewer his character was irredeemable after shooting Wallace, a kid mind you, after having zero proof Wallace ever talked to the cops anyway.\u00a0\n\n\nHe just thought Wallace was weak, and wanted favor with Stringer more than he wanted Wallace to be alive.\u00a0\n\n\nBodie was a POS.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0",

If anything, it makes it even worse, because it shows he fought over those feelings and still shot him.\u00a0\n\n\nBodie isn't a marine, or a cop...he's a teenage drug dealer. And according to the story, Wallace was his 1st murder and someone he knew intimately since childhood.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat do you expect? You expect him to empty the clip on someone he's known since childhood like Schwarzenegger in Predator or something?\u00a0\n\n\nOne thing that's great about the writers of The Wire is their dedication to authenticity, and Wallace's death scene is proof of that.\u00a0\n\n\nMurders irl are not carried out like an action movie or most crime dramas where the shooter is composed and sure of his or herself.\u00a0\n\n\nIrl murder is often frantic, nerve driven, and people getting shot with shaky hands. And I think this scene captured that perfectly.\u00a0",

He feels for his boys, and he understands right and wrong.  He's grown up with impossible choices his whole life, and he's done his best to maintain a moral compass in spite of the inhumanity of the street.\n\n  \nHis first comment in this scene is about how nice it is that they're in such a serene space and it's also in the city.  This is from a kid who has barely ever left the confines of Baltimore, except when he had to go to Boys Village, or drove to Philly for String.
