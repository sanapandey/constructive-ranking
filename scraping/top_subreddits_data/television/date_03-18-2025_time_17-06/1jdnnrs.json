                                    "body": "For all his faults and shortcomings, Eustace still genuinely cares for Muriel, when she is in trouble, and Courage tries to bring it to his attention, he \u2018begrudgingly\u2019 tries to look for her and save her (though it doesn\u2019t always end well for him).\u00a0\n\n\nI put begrudgingly in quote marks because this is the only way he can express himself, having a brother that constantly overshadows him, and an abusive mother that uses Horst as ammo against Eustace, he grew up bitter and grouchy, and lashes out at even people who tries to help him.\u00a0\n\n\nWhich is probably what Muriel sees in Eustace, she doesn\u2019t mind the spiky barriers Eustace put up to protect himself from his own family. She knows inside is a broken man who isn\u2019t all bad.\n\n\nEustace knows this too, and frankly the only reason he dislikes Courage so much is he\u2019s scared, scared that Muriel might not love him as much anymore now that Courage is part of the house, even when Muriel has plenty of love to give for both of them, and as you said, Courage is able to put past Eustace\u2019s dislike for him because he knows Muriel cares deeply for Eustace, Courage would always carry both of them on his back as he flees from the villain of the episode.\u00a0",

Which is why after rewatching the series, I always felt Eustace isn\u2019t as bad to the core as he is usually portrayed.\u00a0",
