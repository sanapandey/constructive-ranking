They've gotten better with channels centered around themes rather than just shows. But with the Hulu/FX resources they have I'd watch a ton of a FXX inspired live stream, The Simpsons, Family Guy, Bob's Burgers, Always Sunny, etc. there's enough good shows they have access to that I'd enjoy the channel without picking one specific show.\n\nThey have a throwback movie stream right now. But I'm shocked they don't have a Disney Channel Throwback Channel. DCOMS and old shows with old Disney Channel bumpers. I know the answer is that while on the internet we like to say this idea would work, in practice nostalgic gimmicks like this don't really move the needle, but I could dream.",
