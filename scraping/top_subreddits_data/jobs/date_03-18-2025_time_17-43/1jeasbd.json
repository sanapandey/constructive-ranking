I have been in my industry for well over 8 years now and I\u2019m seeing my same role getting reposted at different companies for $10k-$20k LESS than when I first started years ago\u2026\n\nSo it has me wondering\u2026if the U.S. is getting to the point where all jobs get degraded to sub $40k, what are they expecting us to do?",

            "body": "*Right now*, companies have all the leverage and are working hard to reset the market.  As the unemployment rate increases you'll see more downward pressure on pay rates and benefits.\n\nThis is cyclical.  As soon as unemployment rates drop, the pressure to increase salaries to woo employees to work for them will increase.\n\nWith that said, if the skillset to do your job is easily commoditized, absent unionization, you may not get the benefit of labor scarcity.  You may have hit a point where you are highly paid for what you do and that can be a dangerous spot to be in, especially in this labor market.  It certainly limits your movement to other companies.\n\nYou might want to learn some new skills to future-proof yourself.",

The goal of labor is to achieve as much production as possible, i.e. profit, for the employer, you are as a worker only a means/production unit, which costs the employer money to maintain (wages). It is the constant endeavor of the employer to reduce these costs as much as possible in relation to profit. So as time passes and business processes as well as technology become 'more efficient', this means that the wages go down and the working hours go up. He attributed this to the fundamental functioning of capitalism, which in his opinion naturally meant the exploitation of the worker.",

Second, not everyone can get an internship due to how many students are in the college system. The chances of getting an internship after college in the US is near zero percent. Third, the CCNA value has degraded so much since 2009 that it's now considered a fundamental certificate. \n\n\\>I would start my own business and not worry about the corp rat race.

What a good idea. Not everyone has mommy and daddy's 200K/year money to just pay off the debt when one fails their business and need to payback their loans.",
