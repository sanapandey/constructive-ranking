It\u2019s a tough and oftentimes a socially unrewarding job. \n\nThere are a lot of advantages in terms of vertical progression as you can branch off from corrections to elsewhere in the CJS for higher pay (most notably policing). However, do keep in mind there are also disadvantages. You *will* get villainized by the public as an extension of ACAB, get emotional strain, and overtime as a result of typically being understaffed and underpaid. The circumstances at the facility may be different for you but this would definitely be something I would consider if I were you.\n\nI also have a Bachelors in CJ. I did a couple years of security and security dispatch and worked my ass off to try to get into policing and had a couple of offers for corrections to make the pivot into policing easier. For me, it ended up not being worth it and I pivoted into IT as a result.\n\nYou could also try asking in any of the CJ focused subs to get insight on what the job is like. There are many willing to share their experiences.",

BA in criminal justice and 25$ an hour you\u2019re not a therapist going to turn these kids around you\u2019re a prison guard. State juvie no fun for anybody.\n\nThat said you\u2019re not a dental hygienist either 35 an hour to schedule appointments, run the credit card and insurance, pick up lunch you got a sweet gig. Maybe no benefits but 8x40x52 should pay your own health insurance.",

Big auto groups always trying to hire for less per hour because you\u2019ll make more hours. Waiving working harder to make the same money like it was a favor.\n\nNow in your case it sounds like a couple years to get back to what you make now. While cost of living is still going up. So it will take even longer to get back to where you were. Thats not ahead. You said you would be back at 35 in 5 years without cost of living increases. Your cost of living increase is 30 -40 bucks a week each year. So lets just say 39 bucks an hour after 5 years. That\u2019ll probably be like making 30 bucks an hour now.\n\nYou say better cost on insurance benefits, but how much worse is out of pocket costs when going to get care. Usually state employees have worse out of pocket costs. And working at a youth facility you WILL be using your insurance more. What good is saving say 3k a year in premiums if you could spend double that in out of pocket expenses.",
