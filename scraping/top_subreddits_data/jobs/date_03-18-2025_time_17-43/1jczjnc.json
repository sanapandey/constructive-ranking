It was so refreshing to talk to a hiring manager who seemed genuinely interested in my experience. Fingers crossed it leads to something! \n\nOn the flip side, I did get a rejection from a position I was super excited about, which stung a bit. It\u2019s so easy to get caught up in the \u201cwhat ifs,\u201d but I\u2019m trying to stay focused on the positive. It\u2019s a rollercoaster for sure! How's everyone else doing this week?",
