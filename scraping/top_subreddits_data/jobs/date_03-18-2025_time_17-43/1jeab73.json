    "selftext": "I know this probably gets said all the time but I just got an offer that went something like this :\n\nAt screening process, I ask what their hiring budget is, they tell me it's capped at $110k. I tell them that amount would be a lateral move for me (that's a lie) and need more. The recruiter notes this and I proceed with interviews.\n\nAfter rounds of interviews, I get an offer at $115k. I tell them I'm losing a very specific benefit that this new company doesn't offer (this is actually true but I'm exaggerating the impact of it). I tell them need 125k.\n\nToday, I got an offer at 120k which I accepted. Went from barely cracking 6 figures to a little more comfortable place.\n\nAlways negotiate, the worst they can do is say no and the ball is back on your court.",

If you can't afford to lose the offer, then you can't afford to negotiate. Otherwise, negotiate.",
