I tailored each resume and cover letter to the job even if it was time consuming, and made sure to include key words in the listing. I\u2019d check new job listings everyday as well in order to be one of the first to respond, since when I did apply earlier I\u2019d at the least get some sort of response. \n\nUsually, I\u2019d churn out about 5-10 applications a week (only applying for jobs I was eligible for, which wasn\u2019t a lot). That is slower than many, but because of the fact that I was less likely to be hired due to lack of experience I personalised each application and worked on them a lot to compensate.",

I interviewed four rounds over the course of a month and made it to the final round, using up all my current place's PTO in order to interview with them because I liked them that much (also, 40% pay increase with is more like 45-50% with the benefits). My current place does not offer sick days and does not offer any vacation time, so it is very sparingly. After feeling confident about my interviews and making it passed the final round, I was expecting an offer sometime today, instead I was denied. I feel like I am going to be stuck in my situation forever. I'm not even sure how to continue on. Fortunately, the only win is that I didn't tell anybody at my current place I was interviewing elsewhere so I don't need to worry about losing my current role. Though, it may not be so bad to go down the street and work as a barista at Starbucks for better pay and benefits. RIP me.",

A month ago I thought I was stuck in this job forever with no opportunity for escape, and then a week later a bunch of jobs that fit my experience opened up that I applied for - a couple of which didn't have many other applicants so I probably have a good chance! Keep pushing through.\n\nAlso - your experience is more than you think it is. If you're doing anything video production related, you're already doing a ton more than a lot of other people can say they've done. It can often feel like you're doing the bare minimum, but compare yourself to someone working in retail. You're scripting, editing, shooting, and doing post-production regularly. You can list a ton of skills in your resume. Good luck!",

They'd had to fill it with someone else.\n\n\nI lost TWO jobs because one of them decided they could drag their feet denying me, which is such a hurtful thing to do.\n\n\nMy only consolation is that it worked out in the end.

And it's just so depressing seeing all the declined autopays in my email and on my phone.  But it did show me how many pointless subscriptions I had.  I will not be renewing them.\n\nMy job search was just show of 2 months.  But it was hard.  I didn't save a lot in the last year because my mother passed.  And before she passed, I moved to my current city to be closer to her.  I was paying her rent and bills a year before she passed and I couldn't stay ahead.  Anyway I've been trying to recover but these jobs are acting up.\n\n  \nFor me this was a difficult job search.  I was only unemployed in 2018, and that was brief.  I was \"let go\" that Monday, and by Friday I had 3 offers (ah the good ol days).  So this is the first time I've been unemployed longer than a month.  I have over 20+ years experience and my skillset is niche, so I'm usually not on the market long.  so for it to take me like a month to get a job, the market is clearly bad.\n\n  \nI feel for the people who have been on 6+ months unemployment.  I really hope you guys find something soon.\n\n  \nThe job is mostly remote, but I do have to go into the office on occasion.  And luckily the office is literally walking distance from my apartment.  So it's nice exercise, since I've been sitting on my fat ass for the last year (due to remote work)\n\nI'll be sacrificing my first few paychecks to rent, because I'm late as fuck. But I should be fully back on my feet by September.",

One day the straw broke the camel's back, and I just walked out.\n\nI secured a similar job a month later, but the process was very, very, slow and another month passed untl I was able to start.  It was good in all respects except the rush-hour commute, but so what.  Then something happened 1000 miles away at another company site - fingers were pointed - CEO was fired, all contractors given the boot, and the company went into hibernation.\n\n6 months later, I hear the company may be starting up again, saw evidence it was, started searching to get back on.  Over the last two months I've had 4 leads, ads, or emails come to me to get back into the industry.  Each one has fallen apart from either ghosting, false info about the work, or recruiters being far too secretive about the work for me to justify following up on what seemed a phantom job.\n\nOne recruiter kept on trying to contact me for 3 weeks - the job was not my preference, *and visiting family over the holiday disrupted a couple of attempts to connect* - but this week we finally talked well ( no ZOOM call ), got on the same track and today I was sent a job offer.\n\nDamn, did that just happen?

Completed the next day - and I was surprised to, at long, long, last, get my onboarding emails and long list of documents to sign, including W4 and I9.  Finally starting to feel real.  Did not get a correct address until the evening before I was supposed to show up *( I had been asking since the first week )*. \n\nOrientation was two days this week, which was a whole lot of nothing.  Confirmed IDs, got temp badges, took pics, and shown around the facility.  Met 6 other recruits, and because it was a place I'd physically been to before, saw a few people I'd met before.  \n\nTalking with the recruits, it became clear that we all got different stories about JUST WHAT the job entails.  I decided to move forward based on some tasks I was told would NOT be part of the job, however another recruit said those tasks would be 50% of our work - so it's clear we each got fed 98% BS on the recruiting side.  The tasks are not real deal-killers for me, it just requires more daily travel than I'd like - and I thought at the very least they would train us to be familiar with the tasks, but not require us to do them - since the are related to our ***\"stated duties & job title\"***. \n\nIt was nice to be in a workplace I find interesting and full of learning potential, nice to meet new people who also have many questions, but disappointing that the *\"orientation\"* was a real shit show of disorganization and bad emails sent to wrong people.  ONLY SEVEN PEOPLE and they could not get it right. \n\nI am hoping it works out, since the pay is okay ( but light ), it's easy to get there, free drinks & snacks *( which is both a pocket-change saver and shopping saver )*.  I'm a light-lunch, just a sandwich guy, but not having to bring anything else just makes the day easier.",

In all that time, I'd only gotten two phone calls and one interview, despite applying strictly to positions that I either matched/exceeded the requirements of. I can't even tell you how many automated rejection letters I got. I felt so trapped.\n\n\nI only even had THAT position because my previous professional employer was... very kind, but simply not management material. Had no real idea about the amount of work being assigned and how unrealistic it was to accomplish. I should've seen the red flag in my interview when I asked what my average day/week would look like in broad strokes, and it was \"too varried to answer\" even though my week-to-week responsibilities were EXTREMELY regular for the years I'd worked there. My manager was simply too detached from the process to even know. Several conversations about the work load would only lead to discussions about my efficiency and how to improve it. Meanwhile I was drowning but couldn't work overtime without being penalized. I took the office opportunity as a chance to leave on good terms since it matched my meager pay (and wasn't that a kick in the teeth... office position asking for 1 year experience matching pay of a position requiring a BS and 2 years experience..)\n\n\nWhen I tell you all that I *cried* when I received this job offer, a mere two hours after the interview, I am actually underplaying it. I broke down. Finally, a company that wouldn't start me at $19/hour despite having a strong STEM degree, experience, strong references, and a buttload of volunteer work. It feels like all the years of grinding, of grinning and bearing it for bosses who seemed to hate my existence when all I wanted to do was help the team succeed in whatever way they outlined, just not by working overtime for free... it just finally paid off. Finally.\n\n\nAnd who knows, it could be totally crap. My team seemed cool, but they could just as well be awful. But the pay alone... I can't even tell y'all what this means to me.\n\n\nI wish this for all of you. Everyone looking for work deserves to be gainfully employed at a company that values their time and efforts in a SAFE working environment. Hoping my good luck spreads to you today.",

Although anything over 40 hours doesn\u2019t even matter anyway in NJ but it\u2019s just an example of how little I\u2019ve used any sick pay. \n\nAbout 2 weeks ago I was super sick with a stomach virus. I reached out to my boss at around 9AM with a 4pm In time that night. I even found a cover for the shift.

All he said to me was \u201cI need xyz tonight it\u2019s gonna be a busy night\u201d then about 30 min later he followed that up with \u201c Make sure you come in tonight\u201d and didn\u2019t address what I said whatsoever lol \n\nWell fast forward to few days ago and I asked the woman who does our payroll to please apply my PTO for the day I was out sick and she looked at me like I was crazy lol \u2026. and OF COURSE now here we are on payday and the sick pay that im owed is NOT in my paycheck..,,\n\nApparently I got suspended cause I made a silly mistake Sunday at work regarding someone\u2019s entree- it was def a rookie mistake. But was it a mistake that warrants suspension??? Absolutely not. Ever since I told my manager that I was in recovery he\u2019s been rude as fuck to me. I get good reviews online pretty consistently & get them in person yet I\u2019m always in one of the worst sections getting shitty tables. I compared this years pay to last year at this time and I\u2019m down almost 40% in my income. And now I got suspended over something trivial? I am thinking of filing a complaint.

I\u2019m trying not to be to upset since Im only 24 and have alot going for me (good savings, amazing sister that\u2019s been a great cheerleader,etc) but it\u2019s just hard not being where I thought I would be.",

It's such a slap in the face.  \n  \nManager started off by thanking me for all my hard work on a particularly challenging project, where I was the 3rd person to be in charge of a certain discipline, and the person to get it over the line.  At times this project was a full-time commitment, which he acknowledged, and to not  burn myself out I put aside part of my other duties during this time, which he agreed was fair. However, as a result I haven't been performing my other duties, which is what I was mainly hired for, due to this one project which wrapped up now about 2 weeks ago. \n\nI don't disagree with his assessment. I think they set me up for failure though by assigning me to this one project knowing how demanding it would be, and I think 0% raise is essentially punishment and a slap in the face. \n\nI would have accepted a lower-than-usual raise with his assessment. Hell, even a 1% raise with the motivation I would have bought because it's something and it's a token raise at least to acknowledge that some good work was done in the year. 0 is an insult. \n\nI changed vacation plans because client decided with short notice to visit us and wanted to see me. I traveled overseas at short notice repeatedly, and there's been so many late nights, weekends and other things that I could have made way more noise about but didn't. Not to mention travel times and all that we don't get paid overtime or time off in lieu for. \n\nHe said 0 should be a carrot for the coming 12 months. 1-2% would have been a carrot. I get *something,* but it will be more next year if we now do these other duties good. 0 is punishment for the hard work he was very satisfied with. \n\nI don't want to have this relationship with my employer. I'm not confrontational and I just want to stay in one place and not have to jump. I've only been here about a year, but this is just another straw on the camel's back. \n\nHe could have given me a grand a year in raises and I would have told him that's fair and be happy.

            "body": "Help me understand my situation in life?\n\nAfter working for myself for most of my adult life, I quit due to inability to find good help and uncertainty of income coming in. So in November of 2022 I took a job as a shop foreman for a small trucking company and warehouse business. I gave it  my all going in. I was in contact with the owner, and the safety guy which had been working there for 30 years was really close to the owner, and the 20 year old kid that worked under me was married to the safety guys daughter. I turned this company around from having a complete unsafe and poorly maintained fleet of trucks. As I worked here I started noticing red flags. I am a previous addict and clean for many years at this point. I started seeing that the owner and the safety guy and his son in law were at work high on amphetamines, as well as a few of the drivers. So I would be alienated by everyone and left to do everything by myself. It was a very toxic work environment. So I started looking for another job and was able to secure a job with Freightliner. Once there I got settled in. Turned out that the guy that ran the service department had worked there 20 years and started as a service tech. His leadership tactics were belittling and intimidating employees and because the owner of the dealership loved him, nothing could be done about him through HR. So I started looking for another job. I was able to get hired by a company that wanted my expertise to get their own shop laid out and equipped so they could do all their own maintenance and repair work, instead of hiring outside companies to maintain their fleet. I was given a company credit card and a budget to equip the shop. My boss was the regional transportation manager which I found out bullshitted his way in that position and was new himself. Instead of talking direct with you, when he talked he talked out the side of his mouth about everything to seem smarter or something. Typical scumbag in my opinion. For example he would say things like hold on let\u2019s not throw the baby out with the bath water! Always dipping and diving. On my first day he asked \u201cdo you want my job\u201d? I knew I was in trouble from that point on. I even brought a young kid with me from Freightliner he was 19. So we started in the shop really making an impact on the quality of the trucks and keeping all the trucks in great condition. In the same building with me was another bs liar that had as the terminal manager. I had to really fight for power with the terminal manager as I was on his territory and he didn\u2019t want me to have any power. So it was a constant power struggle with him. So he was two facing me and lying to higher ups about me I later found out. I was putting in 14 hour days here, really busting my ass. One day I yelled at the young kid under me for not doing a repair the way I asked him to do it, in which time I kicked the broken light off the step of the truck I asked him to fix. So he went to HR and the next thing I know was my boss showed up from corporate office which is 8 hrs drive away. Out of no where he says we had a report of some very concerning behavior of you kicking a light off a truck. So we are terminating you immediately, we need your company phone and credit card, and you have 15 minutes to clear out your desk. I told them both my boss and the terminal manager that you were firing me because I\u2019m a threat to you. When I left my boss says if you need a reference let me know. I was out of work for 4 months after this trying to find another job. When you\u2019ve been in your field for 30 years and make 6 figures it\u2019s hard to find a like position. Then I was able to get a job at a truck repair facility that catered to a lot of small companies or guys who had their own trucks. When I was pushing my toolbox off the trailer the shop foreman came over to help me and when he looked in my eyes it was a look of concern like \u201care you here to replace me\u201d? He constantly micro managed me, constantly coming to check on my work, making me redo a lot of my work that was very good, but not the way he would do it. He really wore me down. I stuck it out as long as I could until eventually I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore I had to quit because this guy was making me sick with stress. Then I was able to get a job as a shop foreman at a construction company that operates a fleet of Tri axle dump trucks. After starting I find out that my boss is some rich higher up guy that\u2019s in with the owners of this construction company. Not only that but he owns the property that this terminal is located on and he has a contract with them for 12K a month rent for facility which they are responsible for any maintenance. Plus he gets a salary of 6 figures for running the truck shop plus he got a brand new company supplied Toyota Tacoma. Seems like a conflict of interest to me and very concerning to say the least. Once I started working and he saw my talents I started being alienated and left to myself to work. He constantly comes around walking through the shop with his boots knocking on the floor like as if it\u2019s his calling card. Just constantly paces through shop and will come and stare at you working very weird. He communicates with all the regular mechanics about important things and information but leaves me in the dark about everything but plays me like everything is fine. Only reason is because I know how to lead so I just take in work on my own and stay to myself. I really have a bad gut feeling that he\u2019s plotting to get rid of me by political assassination. I\u2019m pretty sure he is actively trying to turn everyone against me. I\u2019m back in the back of the shop and if I go over to the bay where all the other guys are he\u2019ll see it on the camera and he\u2019ll race down and just show up and stand there like he\u2019s not up to anything. It\u2019s like he\u2019s making sure I\u2019m not communicating with them at all. I\u2019m very scared as my gut feeling tells me I\u2019m in trouble. The last 2 years have been a complete nightmare with these jobs. Every single place I go my talent goes against me and puts a target on my back. Why does this keep happening to me? Why am I hated by everyone so much? I love my career and put my heart and soul into it. I work long hours and am very dedicated to my job. I do the job to the highest quality possible and I also work straight through breaks and lunch everyday. The work ethic I was raised with I thought would put me in a very successful position, but I can\u2019t get a break! I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I\u2019m 46 years old and I just want to find somewhere to go where my talent and efforts are appreciated. These young guys in there 20\u2019s out here in the work force are also very cut throat and there is no respect for an experienced guy my age. This world is not the world I was raised in.",

I have been employed for nearly 20 years and worked my way up ftom entry level\u00a0 to senior data analyst and project manager. I started thinking about getting out in the last 6 months,\u00a0 as the corporation is in turmoil and my mindset has changed to considering starting a small business.\u00a0 3 weeks ago I was approached on LinkedIn by a local recruiter about an unadvertised opening. In short, it was a surprisingly good fit for my skills, and I really liked the company culture on their website. I did get an interview, and on Friday, I met the hiring manager via a zoom call. I thought I had a great rapport, asked and answered the questions that mattered with ease and expertise.\u00a0 I sent a follow up thank you via the recruiter early today and got told within the hour that the hiring manager thought it didn't go well and that\u00a0 I could struggle to keep up with the pace and culture of the company.\u00a0\u00a0\nMy first thought was 'equine excrement'. I dashed off a reply of thanks to the recruiter and focused on work at hand.\u00a0 2 hours later I suddenly felt like I'd been sucker-punched in the gut and had to stop working because of the dark cloud of shame that had settled in my mind. Why on earth was I considered unworthy after that engaging dialogue? What was wrong with...me? I'd been passed over before in my life, but this time, it felt weighty.\u00a0 It felt like the door had been opened, just so someone or something could slam it in my face. Did I have an enemy working there? Am I too old? Did something about me on that zoom call offend?\u00a0 ( and no, I didn't squirm or use AI to answer questions\u00a0 ; P )\n\n\nSo here I sit, like king David hiding from Saul in a cave, silently typing my cry for help to a quiet deity who never speaks to me directly. Why is this door closed after opening it to give me a glimpse of what lies beyond the dim walls of my office and lackluster work projects?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWhat do you want me to do for you? I'll let this one go, but what's next?\u00a0\n\n\nI'm listening.\u00a0",
