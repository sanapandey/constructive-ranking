    "selftext": "She asked about my prior work and reasons for leaving and I gave the canned \"new opportunity\" and even one legitimate \"more money\" reasons and then she went into me being a red flag because I haven't stayed at a job over 2 years since 2020. I'm not an idiot I know it looks bad but her bluntness really threw me off. If you don't already - please have smart convincing answers for the job hopping questions because the polite cliches seem to be failing me. I tried to be polite and engaged the rest of the interview but it was hard. She also said I didn't have the amount of experience she wanted for the role (I have 3 years of grant admin experience) which again was like...what? I tried to keep it together but honestly it was a huge fumble. I am obessing over what I could have said to be more convincing in the face of her doubts. Ieft the interview feeling rather dumb and wondering why she even agreed to see me.",

            "body": "My last 3 jobs: stayed at one for 7 years; the next one almost 5; the third one for 10 months. I left that last job because it was a shitty company that wasn\u2019t a good match for me and the job itself made my mental health a serious struggle - like worse than it has ever been. For the first time EVER I walked away from a job with nothing else lined up. Fast forward a couple months and I\u2019m interviewing for a similar job at another company. I have more than enough experience for the position. The person who would have been my direct supervisor interviewed me, loved me, told me I just need to go through the process of speaking with her boss. In that interview, he kept harping on me leaving my last job. I was semi honest - I let him know it was the worst company I had ever worked for; I explained the turnover rate was unlike anything I had ever seen; I kept how it was mentally affecting me to myself. He finally says \u201ccan you promise me that if I hire you, you won\u2019t leave 6 months down the line?\u201d I sat on it for a second, smiled, and said \u201cI\u2019m clearly not historically a job-hopper. So can YOU promise ME that you\u2019ll incentivize me to want to stay past 6 months, because this clearly goes both ways?\u201d By the look on his face, I knew I just lost the job. I wasn\u2019t wrong. But it felt SO GOOD to give a real answer to a bullshit question. As someone who has been involved in hiring and onboarding for over a decade, I do understand there\u2019s a cost to hiring and training; I understand turnover is disruptive to culture stability in a team/company; I understand that job hopping can be viewed as lack of commitment/reliability. The problem is, companies don\u2019t get the role they play in their turnover problems. We\u2019re all just expected to sit down, shut up, and be grateful for the job. Oftentimes, that isn\u2019t doable.",

He was giving me the boilerplate answers to my questions about turnover (he claimed it was very low but I came prepared and knew that wasn\u2019t true; also, a recruiter had reached out to me about that SAME location, for the SAME position, three separate times in the course of a year). He wasn\u2019t able to answer my questions about that specific location and the employees I would be inheriting. I had those answers from the previous interview as well as my connections at the company, but I wanted me and him to have that conversation as well. With my experience, I am well versed at being the interviewer - I know what questions to ask, what answers come off positively and what comes off negatively. I also know bullshiting an interviewee only serves to do one thing - letting them walk into a situation they weren\u2019t prepared for, therefore ruining their morale from the get go, and what could have been a great employee is now just a subpar one because the job they\u2019re in is not what they signed up for.",

The last two jobs did mass layoffs despite performance as you'll note from the recommendations provided. I also had a couple contracts ask to convert at a much lower rate financially and at the time I couldn't afford the paycut and one was just a bad fit managerially. I am definitely looking for my next opportunity to be my forever work home. I want to make an impact and build connections that will carry me throughout my tenure at this organization.\"\n\n\"....Which actually reminds me to ask, do you have any Intel on the management style? I'd like to avoid micromanagement.\"\n\nThis answer has helped me flip the narrative and control the conversation. I continue asking questions that show I'm taking this serious and want to stop the hopping, like asking about culture and asking about challenges facing the team so I can analyze the fit. Thanks to this, I've been able to convince interviewers a reason to give me a chance despite a record of being at most places a year. Overall, I've been at most places 1 year, typically leaving for layoffs or role elimination. With about 3 roles averaging 2.5 years, one place for 7 years and 4 places for less than 6 months. (2 of these due to performance but their reasoning being questionable. 1 contract where they literally never gave me anything to do and 1 where the company demerged from the parent company thus ending my reason for staying.) \n\nI've shared my real reasons for hopping and the stories start to sound like excuses or lies so I've started getting ahead of the issue in interviews and developed the elevator speech. I also get recommendations on LinkedIn from almost every job. If we ended on bad terms I usually ask a peer if we had a good relationship.  \n\nThe biggest piece to takeaway in mamigerial fit. Focusing on this forces the company to qualify itself to you or makes the interviewer know you are taking it seriously.",

My supervisor and his boss said I wasn't allowed to meet my goals because of their lack of management and I was going to accept only 5%, when others were getting 20%+?  Fuck that. I'm not going to keep being a team player when they lack management skills. Was I there a short time? 2 years, sure. Was I going to stick it out another year and hopefully they realize my worth? NOPE.\n\nIn January, a former co-worker texted me and said \"we have a job opening\", I said hell yeah, applied, got the job and earned a 21% pay increase. I'm doing LESS, with better working conditions, better co-workers and a supervsior was isn't a condescending asshole, who likes to use the word retard over and over. \n\nDo whats best for you and your family. No one else.",

Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do about that. The only thing that will overlook that is if they check every box I'm looking for. You have to bring something to the table that will wow them and will allow them to overlook the job jumping. It sounds like you're only looking for remote work. If you really need a job keep all options available.",
