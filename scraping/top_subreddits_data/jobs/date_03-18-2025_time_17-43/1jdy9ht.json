    "selftext": "I just booked a flight to Thailand, I'm leaving the US on friday, I'm a dual us/thai citizen so I can come back any time (probably not). I used a credit card to book a flight on expedia because I only have 300 dollars left in my pocket man, I don't care I'm not looking back. I have family in Thailand so it's not like I'm coming with no support. I know most people don't have that kind of privilege and luck to just up and leave and be able to come back any time, dont remind me.. If you had that kind of opportunity in the situation im in you would take it too\n\nGraduated with a CS degree, couldn't find a job in a long time because when even Mcdonalds isn't even hiring anymore because they're posting fake job posts for cashier jobs even though cashiers do not exist anymore in my area since they replaced all of their cashiers with kiosks (just one example), you know there's much bigger problems in the us than people want you to believe and they'll call you fearmongering for bringing up specific examples, and we're basically in a recession and they'll call you doomposting...\n\nThese entry level  jobs that are suppose to be for people just entering the workforce are being sent to places like india and philippines for cheap labor or being taken by AI. Jobs that use to not require it for example data entry now require arbitrary requirements 5 years of experience and a bachelors degree. How are you suppose to get experience when these companies don't want to give you experience. You can have all of those and they'll magically find something else to disqualify you\n\nThese people are celebrating federal workers being laid off in mass.. Now federal workers are flooding the job market too, this is what 80 million people voted for\n\nLinkedIn is corporate shilling now and people trying to make you buy their courses. Indeed job applications are sent to the void. Applying to company websites just sends you to Workday applications and we all know how bad applying to jobs using Workday is.\n\nI gave up on my 600k subscriber Youtube channel that I worked on since high school to go back to college and get this degree to try to get a \"real job\", because if you have content creator or something on your resume no one will take you seriously, see how shit turned out? Being a social media creator takes hard work and dedication but people do not want to believe that, they think it's not a real job not knowing the amount of effort that goes into this even though I was making good money doing this at the time but it wasn't enough to live off on since I didn't go all in because of priortiizing high school and college and shit\n\nI fell for the learn to code bullshit, so did millions of other people, look where that got me\n\nI cannot imagine myself working a 9 to 5 until I'm 65, I'm 26, wasting away my youth for an imaginary job to hopefully come by that doesn't exist to maybe afford 5 dollar hash browns and aldi muffins for breakfast because people told me it's more respectable than being a video gamer for a living, social security will definitely not exist when I'm 65, look at what they did to pensions.\n\nThese companies do not care about you, why should I care about them? Why show these companies loyalty and respect when they aint gonna show you loyalty and respect? They dehumanize you during interview processes. They use AI to filter your job application out if you don't have the exact keywords they're looking for. They'll lay you off without hesitation and all of that \"company loyalty\" and bootlicking they sold you on will punch you right in the face, they're not gonna spare me, you'll be the first on the list to be laid off despite having stellar performance reviews and referrals, all of that fancy and shiny corporate marketing benefits of working at these jobs is just a facade it's all fake, it's to keep you obedient and deflect their problems on you, \"it's your fault you didn't meet the quota\". They do these record breaking mass layoffs claiming they need to lay people off due to \"budget cuts\" while also reporting record breaking profit at the same time spitting at these peoples faces like you believed their lies, how are you just accepting this and being taken advantage of?\n\nThailand couldn't possibly be worse. Being dead looks easier than what I'm going through in the us, Ive been miserable living in the us. Relationships in the us was all transactional, people expect to get something from you so relationships with these people were not genuine. I'll most definitely be happier in thailand with cost of living being cheaper and since all of my family is there, it's just me and my parents in the us.\n\nYou cannot even go to the corner store to buy snack without a car here, the nearest corner store is 35 minutes if you walk there. This place is so car dependent, you do not have legs if you don't have a car here\n\nYou can do everything right and still be told you're not doing enough and you'll be called entitled for wanting literally any job. No one is asking for a 6 figure job stop putting words in my mouth, all I'm asking is A job, I don't care what job at this point, but then see what happens?\n\nThey call you lazy and don't want to work, but they won't even give you a job in the first place. They'll say network, but networking is useless when these jobs are not even hiring, and these people know you're only networking to get a job so it feels fake. They'll tell you to upskill, I did a coding bootcamp, I went back to college and graduated, I got an internship at bank of america but they laid off thousands of people including interns, I built coding projects that thousands of people actively use, I abandoned my dream of being a Youtuber to try to get a \"real job\" because no one takes Youtubers seriously, they told me if you have that on your resume you won't be taken seriously, so look where all of that got me. They'll tell you to apply to Walmart or Mcdonalds, when I obviously did but those jobs are not even hiring. They'll tell you to set up an LLC or put a bankrupt company on your resume to cover a job gap, no one falls for that bullshit man. They'll tell you 1.8 million job openings are in the US, when these people don't even live in the US not knowing a vast majority of these job openings are fake job posts and scam jobs, jobs that have no intentions of hiring, jobs that are trying to collect all types of information about you to sell it to data brokers, etc.\n\nNo one reads cover letters anymore but I still write them after researching the company and why I would genuinely be interested in working there and my background, knowing full well no one will read it and still get ghosted. The job application process is so dehumanizing, these applications require you to do disrespectful trivias like match the card type shit for IQ tests calling them personality tests, you apply with your resume, and have to reenter everything again that's already on your resume if the job uses Workday for example, and still don't get interviewed. There's a lot more stuff that I can't be bothered listing out that's insanely disrespectful with these job applications\n\nPrepare to be at a soup line soon if this continues because this isn't sustainable, there's already hundreds of people at the soup line near my house and they're even cutting funding for soup lines here, the government just ended buy local programs here [USDA cuts leaving West Michigan food bank in state of unease | WOODTV.com](https://www.woodtv.com/news/kent-county/usda-cuts-leaving-west-michigan-food-bank-in-state-of-unease/) I know a dude who relies on food banks now and he worked at Paypal before, not even fancy big name companies help your resume anymore\n\nYou can do all of this and still be told what you're doing is not enough like this dude [https://www.reddit.com/r/thai/comments/1jd798u/comment/mi89e26/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/thai/comments/1jd798u/comment/mi89e26/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nSo you win America.

It's not about being lazy or entitled; it's about the system being broken for so many. It's good that you're making a change and choosing your happiness. Sometimes, breaking away from an environment that's holding you down is the best thing you can do for yourself. Hope Thailand offers you the fresh start you deserve.",

You built up an impressive following, which shows you had incredible potential. There are YouTubers with fewer than 100 followers who are making tens of thousands a month\u2014some even making more than doctors! It's pretty wild.\n\nMaybe you could consider starting fresh with gaming content again or even create vlogs about \"the journey of someone who left YouTube for a career, but now they're leaving it all behind to move to Thailand and start over.\" Just a thought!

People kept saying how having social media presence would be a red flag and a turn off on a resume and stuff for tech jobs/traditional office jobs where communication and skills unrelated to programming like Asana, video production and thumbnail design would be a red flag since it has nothing to do with coding. Being a Youtuber takes hard work and dedication and these people want to downplay it.\n\nProgrammers are very introverted people, I'm not introverted I like talking to people I have a lot to talk about, I know I would not be a \"culture fit\" or whatever they come up with working with those types of people who look down on deep conversations\n\nMy parents told me to go back to college to get a bachelors degree and try to get a tech job since I already did a coding bootcamp and couldn't get a job since no one hires bootcamp grads anymore and it would be a waste to just give up when I was already deep into this. I thought I would be able to make more money with this tech job 9 to 5 stuff but I was actually making more money just off ad revenue from adsense and paid promotions on Youtube than what I'm making now in this case... If I try to go back to Youtube no one will watch my new videos because the algorithm punishes you for not uploading consistently, I haven't uploaded a new video in almost 2 years and I privated most of my videos so it's pretty much starting all over again and people don't watch gameplay commentary videos anymore they watch short form tiktok type videos now",

Managers and tech leads will yap for hours on random details of a project. Depending on the management technique of the company, meetings may occur as much as 2 to 3 times a week. While the supposed meat of programming occurs with writing the code, in truth much of it is shared between designing, scheduling and fitting the whole damn thing into the broader product. The latter can be an incredibly difficult ordeal. Especially considering that your code directly affects the quality of life of your coworkers. \n\nSimply put the idea of some unwashed guy banging out thousands of lines of code in a basement isn't even true for volunteer projects, its a construction job where in each piece builds on top of each other. While the bricklayers may not talk to each other directly, the quality of their work is communicated to each other.",

Lots of the things you're saying are advice pieces from people who uave no understanding of what content creation as a field really entails. All of the advice is sound for a normal person, sure, but for you?  Nah, content creation takes work and a 600k subscription base is a huge feat!  \n\nLastly, this:\n\n>people don't watch gameplay commentary videos anymore they watch short form tiktok type videos now\n\nCouldn't be more wrong. Video games come in so many different flavors now in a wide array of genres. Customization is deeper than it has been in decades past, which means that for a lot of games there can be a decent learning curve. Combine that with social media and you tend to find very large communities built around single games now where people constantly engage on build crafting, optimization or just fun play styles. The bigger the replay value the more engaged a community tends to be for longer.  People crave content from these games more than you realize and long form vids breaking mechanics down can be very successful. \n\nSure, lots of content do short form vids now, but they do it as a supplement to their normal stuff. Builds engagement and outreach to find wider audiences. But some of my favorite subs right now are creators that exclusively are doing this type of content for all manner of games I follow.  Some of these folks have millions of subs!  The demand is out there and a lot people dont have a huge amount of time to play anymore so we look up content to help us get into a game we like.  \n\n600k is huge man.  Dont sell that short.

Anyone with a sellable skill will be looking to move to a better place. \n\n\nAt the same time, the US has always been one of the hardest countries to emigrate to as a skilled worker, because of the ludicrously inefficient visa process. This will get ten times worse with the mass layoffs and anti immigration sentiment. So more emigration and less immigration. Good for catering to barely literate MAGAts, terrible for the economy and the country at large.\n\n\nReally, the only things that made the US attractive for high skilled workers despite all the regressive social issues and worse QoL was the high salaries and ease of funding for startups. Forcing a recession and making the US unattractive for investors thanks to constantly flip flopping on tariffs and threatening war every other hour while devaluing the dollar is throwing away all the good cards.
