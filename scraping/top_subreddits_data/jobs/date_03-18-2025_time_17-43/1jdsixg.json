    "selftext": "Came into work today to find an email from our CEO stating they\u2019re unable to pay us this week. I\u2019ve never experienced this before, and I have so many questions\u2026\n\nWe weren\u2019t given a solid reason as to why they can\u2019t pay us aside from financial shortage. Our state law requires payment within 13 days of the end of the pay period, which only buys them a week. The org is a nonprofit. I\u2019m concerned that even if they do acquire the money for this payroll, they won\u2019t be able to continue to pay us. In the meantime, am I supposed to continue to show up to work?? Would love to hear from people who\u2019ve either experienced this or are experienced in this.",
