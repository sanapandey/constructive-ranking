Should have just became a shell of a person, started drinking or something, and toil away my life for no pension and no s.s. and it's a union job that didn't give us shit for time off. \n\nI've been unemployed for 6 months and now I'm draining my partner too. I'm a leech. \n\nI've had so many interviews in my field and despite having the experience, the qualifications, the interview experience, a great resume...no one wants me. Applied to 30 jobs on LinkedIn and not a single interview. \n\nThe only thing that brings me job is making things. Carpentry makes me think it would be rewarding building with my hands and hopefully wood will never be replaced with some synthetic AI bullshit. \n",

            "body": "I was a carpenter for 15ish years, and I agree that it\u2019s satisfying to see something come together that you built with your own hands. I loved it, and you probably could go into construction at your age, but be aware of one important fact: it\u2019s fucking *hard*. The physical toll it takes on your body over time is real, and possibly permanent. People often talk as if going into the trades is a cheat code to decent money, but only people who have never done it think it\u2019s easy.\n\nI say go for it, but with open eyes.",

Imagine all the smells and how good it feels to work with your hands to create beautiful woodwork. Keep that image in your mind knowing that is your destination, and make a plan for how to get there. If you have to find a job to pay the bills in the meantime, then so be it. But continue to do carpentry in your spare time and find other people who share your interests. You have so much of your life left to live. Do what brings you joy. I\u2019m saying this as a 50 something who is in between careers because I decided to quit a job that was sucking my soul dry and am now taking classes for a new career. It took me a while to get the courage, but as someone put it to me, you\u2019ll be 60 in x many of years whether you do this or not. Wouldn\u2019t you rather be doing what you love rather than simply tolerating/surviving your life?",

Having refurbished my house over the last 2 years, I have experienced significant difficulty getting tradespeople to turn up. Due to a massive shortage of supply and major demand, most trades charge a premium (don't blame them), so I'm considering using savings alongside part-time work to learn a new skill around which I can build a business (tiling, plastering, landscaping). I realise the majority of the learning takes place after you have learned the fundamental skills, but it's not clear what the realistic time to being able to work professionally is. I suspect you have many of the same questions.",
