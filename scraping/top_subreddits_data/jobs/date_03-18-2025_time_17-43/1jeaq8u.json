Your time is next!!\n\nLots of love and positive energy to everyone!!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit: I would like to share a tool I used when applying. Completely free as well. It is a chrome extension called JobWizard (from jobwizard.ai) that can automatically fill job applications for you using your resume and the position. Feel free to edit the auto filled info as per your liking. Reduces a lot of time and pain when writing things such as cover letter or job/company specific questionnaire to tailor it with your profile.\n",
