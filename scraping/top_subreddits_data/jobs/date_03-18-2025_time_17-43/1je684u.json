    "selftext": "When I first started job hunting, I hesitated to apply for roles asked for 1-3 yoe\u2014I thought I didn\u2019t stand a chance. Then I joined a startup and talked to the founder about it. He told me that startups care more about flexibility than a perfect resume. Most of them don\u2019t actually expect candidates to check every box. What really matters is whether you have the core skills to succeed, if you're adaptable and willing to learn, and if you align with their mission and culture.\n\nI learned that the best way to overcome the experience gap is to highlight transferable skills. If you\u2019ve managed a team in retail, that\u2019s leadership. If you\u2019ve built a personal project, that\u2019s initiative. Your experience is often more relevant than you realize. Passion also beats perfection\u2014if you genuinely care about a company\u2019s mission and show you\u2019re eager to grow, you\u2019ll stand out. And most importantly, apply even if it feels like a stretch. Seventy percent of people in new jobs felt underqualified when they started\u2014growth happens on the job.\n\nIf you\u2019re second-guessing whether you should apply for that role, just go for it. You might be more qualified than you think.",
