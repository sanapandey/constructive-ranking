    "selftext": "I work at a McDonald's and I found out yesterday that the General Manager is trashing me to potential employers to avoid me being hired elsewhere. I've already decided I'm going to quit, but the question is do I give them the respect they don't give me and give them a two weeks notice or do I just hand in my uniform and leave? I want to look good for future employers so I'm heavily considering this and looking for some opinions from people who have more experience than I do. ",

The manager on my shift had a problem with me for some reason and only assigned me to do trash and clean and then would send me home. When the bar hired me back, I worked the rest of my 2-3 scheduled days and said I wasn't coming back.",

If you can get actual evidence of this or a statement from those he's badmouthed you to then even better, you may have an actionable lawsuit against the franchise owner.\n\nThe manager doesn't even deserve the \"respect\" of notice that you quit to be honest.  I would very well consider taking the \"Wally Approach\" and reduce output to the point they decide to \"let you go\" just so you can soak them for UI (assuming you can afford to do this, if you can't then watch out for you).",
