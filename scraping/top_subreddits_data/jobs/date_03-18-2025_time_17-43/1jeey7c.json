    "selftext": "Just need to yell into the void.\n\nToday I got rejected from an entry level, TEMPORARY roll at a major media company that\u2019s on an hourly wage. Had 6 rounds of interviews since December, had only positive feedback at every stage. But I think I know where I went wrong, so I guess that doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m just sad that it happened again.\n\nI\u2019m approaching a year since I graduated: top of my class, extremely active on campus, Ivy League, 5 internships. It\u2019s sounds egotistical, but I really feel like I made the most out of my education; every minute of college I was trying my best to go above and beyond to grab opportunities, and I\u2019m frustrated that there is nothing tangible it has gotten me. I\u2019ve applied to over 900 jobs this year, and have made it a dream role, final round interview maybe 5 times. But it seems I can never get the job after the final interview. I don\u2019t know what it is about me, but I\u2019m so exhausted.\n\nI work 3 jobs to make ends meet, grunt work and low paying positions, and during my 1 hour of me time every evening, I\u2019m trying to find fulfilling work. \n\nWhat\u2019s killing me the most is getting so far in the interview process, and having those fantasies about what my new work life could be like - new coworkers, friends, work schedule, routine. And then it all gets dashed away right when I get excited, and I go back to my 7 day work week. \n\nDreaming of a 401k rn. \n\nSomething good is coming, because I\u2019m too capable for any alternative, but the wait is bringing me down.
