    "selftext": "They want us to work 40hours/wk.\nThey want our butt's in a seat the entire time. \nThey want us in the office. \n\nFunny thing is, I'd actually be ok with all of that if 4x10s was offered. That extra day off is huge. Sure 4x8s would be the dream, but for me, 4x10s would be a good compromise. Currently working 8x5s the past 8 years and it's an absolute drag with no end in sight. The weekends fly by whether I'm lazy or productive \n\nI've been looking 4x10s and it's just impossible. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong companies?  I've found one, but unfortunately they aren't hiring, so im just stuck.\n\nIn the meantime, maybe I pick up a hobby to cope a little?",

Banks expect a 20% down payment. 20% of 140,000 is 28,000. It's reasonable that a person earning median income in 1998 could scrape by and save up the 30 grand for a down payment in 1998. That same house in 2023 selling for 400 grand needs a down payment of ***$80,000***, which is absurd. \n\nNobody has 80 thousand dollars just laying around for a down payment. So, go ahead. Tell me again about how much I make vs my parents who bought a house in 1982 for $30,000 at 10%. \n\nI'll save you the trouble of the math. Their monthly payment was a whopping $600 a month, and if I buy that same house today, my monthly payment would be $2500 a month. Even adjusting that $600 a month for inflation, mine is still $500 more. \n\nNow, I get it, the late 70's and early 80's saw ***INSANE*** interest rates on mortgages, but the price for a house was so low that it didn't matter. Now, since the interest rates are climbing back up the way they did in the mid 70's that ***Average sale price*** of a new home being $500,000 right now is extremely significant. \n\nIt's gone up another 25% since 2023, and now the expected down payment is $100,000, which was enough to buy an older house in need of repairs 25 years ago. So, in order for me to buy a house 25 years ago, I needed enough income to make payments on a house that would cost $150,000. I'd also need a $30,000 down payment saved up. You're allowed 28% of your income to the mortgage, so your monthly income needs to be 72% higher than the monthly mortgage payment. Or roughly stated, your mortgage payment should only be 1/4th of your monthly income. Monthly payment on a 150,000 house is about $1133. Multiply that by 4 and your monthly income needs to be $4,532 or 54,384. That was 25 years ago.\n\n25 years ago the ***Barrier to entry*** into the housing market was an income of approximately $54,000. \n\nToday, that same house will probably sell for $500,000. I gotta have $100,000 liquid cash to make the down payment, and the monthly payment is $2900, meaning my income needs to be $11,600. That's 140,000 per year. \n\nIf you're married, both of you need to make ***AT LEAST*** $70,000 a year to buy a house right now. If you're single, you're probably not buying a house. How many jobs are available in the US that pay $140,000? For that matter, how many pay $70,000? The median ***household*** income right now is only $80,000 which is only ***HALF*** what you need to buy a house. \n\nGo ahead, tell me again how much money I have compared to my parents. Go ahead. I'm all ears.",
