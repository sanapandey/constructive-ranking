Recall documents explain that a transmission control valve is liable to excess wear, eventually causing a loss of pressure via a fluid leak and then harsh shifting or even front wheel lock-up. Obviously, this potential leads to an increased risk of crashing, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says.",

They have really bad shudder stock when not in sport mode and I think it\u2019s because it sits in too high a gear for efficiency reasons. Absolutely ridiculous it sits in 10th gear at 40 mph in regular Drive mode. Completely bogs down the acceleration. \n\nI don\u2019t think recent 10 speeds have any major reliability problems.",
