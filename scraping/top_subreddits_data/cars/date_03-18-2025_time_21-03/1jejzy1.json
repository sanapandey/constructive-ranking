I'm sure the demand is there but I'm sure the demand is *much* stronger for N/A models and/or RWD models (GT3, 4.0, S/T, etc).\n\nI'd love a manual Turbo but I don't think they'll make one. That being said, I'd love if they'd make a GT2 with a manual transmission. Especially if they made a very strong one (e.g. some overbuilt G96/88) that can handle 700+ hp & RWD. Would be awesome.",
