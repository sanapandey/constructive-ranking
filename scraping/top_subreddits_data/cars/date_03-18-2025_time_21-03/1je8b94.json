The third one, understandable - seems like something easy to fix with some minor tweaks - maybe adding a little trim rim inin the grill to make it look like most BMWs and some contrast",

When they heard this, BMW USA apparently told them they wouldn\u2019t be ordering any if you couldn\u2019t get a stick, since the take-rate for manual M3\u2019s is high in the US. \n\nEventually BMW Germany folded, but the compromise was that the manual wouldn\u2019t be updated or changed in any way. \n\nIt was never about \u201ccan we fix this\u201d it was always \u201cthis isn\u2019t worth the cost\u201d. \n\nMakes me sad to think about.",

It's great that they can tolerate the stiffer and louder ride, I turned the wrong side of 30 and need something that isn't going to be beat me up on shitty SoCal roads. I was realistic about my needs and priorities in so far as costs go (I got real tired of $2k tire changes on my dailies) and I'd argue my M240i has been more impressive to own simply because I'm always surprised by what I can wring out of it for what it is.",

If my M240ix had a manual, it would honestly be my perfect car - I can add power, and the B58 engine is absolutely incredible, like a modern day 2JZ if you\u2019ll allow me the fanboi hyperbole. \n\nBut, I can easily get 30mpg on my commute, the M240ix is very comfortable, it\u2019s absolutely a speed demon - Jason Cammisa once said on his Instagram that it\u2019s like they strapped a rocket to a Buick - and the AWD is intelligent enough to provide good traction for rainy roads with the OEM tires which is important here in the PNW to me, personally, but not a requirement by any means. A RWD M2 would be fine to drive as well, I just love the AWD/coupe matchup.",

But to me it looks like a modern e36 and I fucking love it. When I was a kid I spent a lot of time building my dream M car online, and dreaming of the day I could order my own. When I was 19 I was able to snag a e36m for $6k USD and it remained my favorite car ever. I felt just as happy taking delivery of this as I did back then with my e36.\n\nIt really feels like BMW made this car just for me. It was pure luck they released this at a time when I was finally in a place to do it. And they fucking nailed it all around imo. I was surprised when I heard all the hate, it was exactly what everyone was yelling for when the g80/82 released.\n\nShifter sucks, they have for years, will be upgraded. My e36m was the same but a UCC Evo 3 fixed it right up. Biggest downside to a stick is the clutch, it needs to be upgraded to handle a standard tune power increase.\n\nThe weight is nowhere near as noticeable as you'd think. Sure it does understeer a bit, but every M car I've driven always did from factory.\n\nDo I wish I waited another year for the purple? Hell yeah. But the increase in price makes it meh. My 24 build matched with a 25 in purple would have been $6k more. Plus, my e36 was Alpine White, so I probs would've gone with that regardless for sentimental reasons. \n\nMy OTD was $69,xxx USD with a few options and the $3k M Performance suspension. I don't believe any other car exists that can match how much car you get for the price.\n\nIt drive fantasically. Makes an awesome daily and fun car. Me and my pup can do 10+hrs rides with no issues, and when its fun time its way more car than i can handle.\n\nBiggest con is the exhaust. From factory you can't hear shit, and the fake engine noise is the worst. My catback made this thing sound amazing, and obvs i coded out the fake noise the day I took delivery lol.\n\nAnyone curious about anything just ask. I don't have a lot of people irl that see it as anything more than a status symbol, so I am happy to talk about it as the monster it is.",
