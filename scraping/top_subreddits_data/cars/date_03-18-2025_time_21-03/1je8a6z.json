Other than Germany I dunno where you're supposed to use it, other than on the 410 at 2am doing drag pulls starting at 100. Which is neat I guess but pretty niche.",

They're not that much faster in the real world beyond a certain power\\weight because you're at the limit of tires. I guess maybe 60-110 pulls on the highway are better and depending where you live there might be some opportunities for that. I dunno. \n\nI've driven a lot of these, including Lucids and Plaids and trackhawks.

We routinely go over 500 mph in airliners and put the shades down, whereas a slow drift in a hot-air balloon makes lifetime memories. There\u2019s no denying that the new hybrid, all-wheel-drive M5 ravages a highway with the best of \u2018em. We\u2019re talking zero-to-60 in about three seconds, triple-digit speeds after just a brief toe-dip, and enough\u00a0*g*\u00a0generated in turns to make your head feel like a ship\u2019s anchor. And yet, at times, we found ourselves reaching for the shades.\n\n>Juiced by a $3100 carbon exterior package, the car certainly looks the part, with flaring nostrils and fenders, quad pipes jutting from the bumper, and deeply bolstered leather buckets in contrasting leather and with carbon-fiber accents. And for many buyers, that will be enough, thank you. They don\u2019t need drama, they don\u2019t want steering wheels that dance in the hands or wooly lift-throttle oversteer or bawling, unfiltered exhaust notes or any question at all as to whether they will make it through the next corner without pretzeling against a tree.\n\n>Others, however, may find the M5\u2019s style of speed a bit cold. Those who have tried parabolic skis know the feeling; the equipment does all the work for you. Simply mash the pedal and yank the wheel in the desired direction and the computers running the hybrid-electric all-wheel drive, the suspension, the differential, and the stability control figure out how to deliver, all while piping in simulated engine roar through the sound system. Likely you\u2019ll run out of courage before the M5 runs out of capability. You may run out of interest, too; nothing is as boring as invulnerability. The M5 does not make you work for it, and as with anything just handed to you, the value of the result is less.\n\nProbably the most nuisance and fair take of how the car drives by someone who's driven it.",

In design this manifests as designs that professionals love but the general public either hates or is confused by. Some of the best examples are from architecture where architects are often not beholden to public opinion, so they can design brilliant buildings from an architectural perspective, but that the public hates - e.g. most of brutalism.\n\nWith cars the tension is that designers are beholden to the public via sales figures, but the board still need to allow them some level of creative expression or the best designers will leave (see the VW Group exodus to Hyundai Group and China). With BMW specifically, part of their underlying belief is that design that's too easily digestible at launch looks dated more quickly. My personal example is Audi; I think all their vehicles look pleasing in-period, but quickly become boring and pass\u00e9. Back to BMW, their approach is to introduce elements that may be controversial, but will stand out over time as setting the cars apart from their competitors of the era. One successful example of this is the [E60 5 series](https://bimmers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/bmw-e60-overview-3.jpeg), which was polarizing like the current model, but which people seem to have come around on and think has aged gracefully now that the controversy has thoroughly died down.",

The F3X cars were well received at launch and still look timeless.

The Z4, 8-Series, and the late-model F90 are lookers. I also think the F87 Comps are a perfect balance of aggressive and elegant, but this is all subjective anyway.

The 718 sounds pretty good in person, especially with the factory sport exhaust. It has a deep rumble down low that doesn\u2019t translate well on YouTube videos. It will never sound as good as the flat 6 but it has its own unique character that I like more than the F20.",

Those cars are no longer intended to be \"fun\" in a thrilling, edge of the seat way. They're intended to be \"fun\" in the sense that throwing around a big, powerful, heavy boat and still have it be composed, quiet, and luxurious is surreal in a positive way. And when you're done you get onto the highway and cruise at whatever speed you want while being unbothered by the outside.\n\nIt's an entirely different value proposition from just two decades ago. I think in a lot of ways this is what those cars would've been had this been possible at this price point two decades ago.
