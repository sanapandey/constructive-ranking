They may be on the hook for another $30K or so for a Rivian replacement so the buy case here is get fancy Rivian for the same price as another cheaper EV. I doubt Hyundai or Polestar are going to offer such a sweet trade.",

Even if the company actually takes a loss. Shareholders love the idea of reducing costs of production and think it's inevitable and shows room to turn a profit.",

Every second your factory is idle you are bleeding amortization. As long as selling a car covers the cost of materials and labour, it's better to sell a car at a loss than to not sell one at all. Yes you make a loss, but the alternative is more losses. \n\nSource: I run a factory and it fucking sucks.",

No matter if you sell 1 car or 500 you still pay those bills, salaries, loans on equipment, property, etc, which is all baked into the price of the car.\n\nSay all that adds up to $10,000 per car. Total car MSRP is $30,000 to make up everything else, lets ignore profit here. You sell the car for $28,000 you're technically \"losing\" $2,000 but you still got paid for $8,000 of the $10,000 you were going to be forced to pay/lose if it didn't sell at all. \n\nBetter to keep making the cars, keeping those people/factories busy and only lose $2k per car than $10k per car. Closing the factory and letting everyone go to slow losses is also not an option because restarting is ridiculuously expensive compartively.",

Instead of providing like $10K sales incentive they offer this to Fiskers owners for their shitty cars, then sold them as fleet cars at auction hopefully at not too much loss. Rivian has the technology to service these cars to working condition so it might work out. \n\nAlso JPM is likely to shoulder some loss so they dont have a fleet of repo cars they dont have the expertise to sell. \n\nFisker only sells a few dozen thousand of cars so it wont be that much issue for Rivian to absorb I guess. Im seeing this as a win for customers and JPM but terrible sign for Rivian. Such a distraction for a potentially terrible fleet of cars no one wants",

Since Fisker is dead, owners can go after the bank.",
