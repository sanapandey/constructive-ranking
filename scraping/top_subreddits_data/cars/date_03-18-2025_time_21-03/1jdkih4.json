I understand that there are other factors at play but this is a huge point that delineates the two.\n\nNow I ask to those who are more familiar with the matter, does the performance bottleneck happen at the battery or is it more software?",

The clutch also locks up at highway speeds so the ICE can help keep you going when the electric motors start to lose some steam at the upper end of their torque curve.",

I *assume* that the motor can also provide something of a torque boost to the engine as well similar to a mild hybrid setup, but am not 100% sure.\n\nAnd congratulations!
