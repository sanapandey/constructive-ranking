It appears to be borrowing the shell from a car called the [Ligier JS2 R](https://www.exclusiveracing.com/wp-content/uploads/listings/22/js21.jpg)\n\nI think there's some solace to be had in Alpine potentially having another true coupe coming soon, and not just crossovers like every other recently-born premium brand from Europe. Maybe it will share some hardware with the Renault 5 Turbo 3E",

We can also expect both a new mid-size and large crossover EV around 2027, which are supposed to be the first models to be sold in the USA when Alpine makes its way there.\n\nBeyond that, we don't know if Alpine will introduce any non-CUVs that isn't the A310 or the next A110. I've heard that they might make a sedan to compete with the 5 Series but that's it.",

Then the initial Dream Garage is completed as promised during the Renolution presentation in 2021. \n\nThe A310 and two as-of-yet unnamed SUV\u2019s are currently farther away in development. Its actually unclear if the car spy-shotted here actually is the A310-version of the platform or just a mule for the A110 EV-version.\n\nAlpine also needs to hedge its bets. The A290 wouldn\u2019t sell more than a handful in the US. The main bodystyle selling in the US are SUV\u2019s. A niche brand as Alpine wouldn\u2019t make a difference in market trends.\n\nBasically, Europe - the main market for Alpine - will be eating good with their lineup.",

My main point is that I'm happy that Alpine appears to be going through with making another true 2-door coupe alongside a new A110, not _just_ more crossovers.\n\nWhereas Cupra, a semi-premium performance brand, has no coupe yet (or maybe ever) and has only two non-CUVs thus far. Lotus only has an Emira, and its EV sports car has been delayed while a second CUV is on its way. The future of Euro coupes from other brands feels somewhat uncertain, but maybe that's just a doomer mindset.",

Unlike other brands like you mentioned, failing to capitivate customers by offering just a complete lineup of SUV\u2019s.",
