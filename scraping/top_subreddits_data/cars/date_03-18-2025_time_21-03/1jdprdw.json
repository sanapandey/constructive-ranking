And each of those cars on their lot is just lost money each day. You can even ask them if they care about that because some dealers care and will bend over a bit more because of that while others don\u2019t and won\u2019t for that model.\n\nIt may also help to be lucky enough to speak to the fleet manager as that\u2019s the person who can offer the most discounts and they usually cut straight to the chase, but that doesn\u2019t matter much as your dealer will talk to him.\n\nSource: I used to work as a buyer.

Forum member stated those of us that purchase C6, C7 or C8 ZR1 are not the same type of people that buy the ZO6 or Stingray. He went on to state that this group of cars enthusiasts probably have more than one expensive vehicle in their stable and the price will indeed separate the usual Corvette owner from this group of owners. Several Corvette enthusiasts entered the forum and stated they would be purchasing the ZR1 and did not consider themselves to be in a special group.\n\nThis ZR1 purchase will be my last Corvette.

I believe they were also made to replace the Pontiac G8, as you noted, to meet whatever agreement they had with Holden. If there were a base model, it probably would have been much cheaper.\n\nThat said, what its price would be now, is hard to say. It might be as pricey as a CT4-V BW, but I could also see it more n the price range of a TLX Type S. If it kept Chevy badging, it could replace the CT4 and let GM carry two performance sedans (SS, CT5) with different market targets. Right now, I think the CT4 is lost behind the CT5, along with drowning out the BW in how unexciting the rest of the CT4 trims have been.",

C8 manufacturer times require launch control on, and everything perfect, with most \"great\" launches being in the mid 3s range in warm weather, sunny, dry roadway, and newer pavement. Without launch control the TRX will hit the same numbers as the C8 in more conditions thanks to AWD and likely the extra 3,000lbs. Perfect launch on perfect road the C8 wins, but that's extremely rare. Daily life isn't a twisty track, it's either highway cruising or stop and go.
