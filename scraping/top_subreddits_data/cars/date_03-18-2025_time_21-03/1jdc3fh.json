I am a graduating student moving from Denver, CO to Nashville, TN in a few months. I want to try and trade in and get a car sooner than later to ensure I have transportation in Nashville since I\u2019m not sure my current car will survive the drive. Also open to suggestions if I should purchase there instead. I am looking for a reliable and affordable car, and I\u2019ve heard great things about Toyotas and Subarus. I\u2019ve been looking at the Camry, but am also interested in SUVs with more space (dream vehicle would be a 4Runner but that\u2019s way too expensive). I currently have a Volkswagen, and while I love it, I know it\u2019s not the most reliable and has become expensive to maintain due to known issues with the model. \n\nMany many thanks in advance! I\u2019m very new to this whole situation and appreciate any insight.",

Vehicles are slightly less expensive in general in TN as well.  I would look at a decent late model accord or camry in that price range. It should be fairly easy to find and would be very reliable long term.",
