The CR-V has the nicest, smoothest, peppiest drivetrain I've ever experienced.

I can drive it like a grandma and get 52 mpg on the tank. I can drive like a total jackass and get 49.  It's the most forgiving, efficient car that I've ever seen. \n\n*BUT...* It's not a refined drivetrain. It's \"fine.\" Not bad. Not good. It just does a job. Sometimes it's quiet.

Given the massive fuel economy difference already, does it really matter if I can get 1-2 less litres per 100k?",

I fit an entire 88 key electric keyboard on a legitimate stand with its bench in my hatch. Can't do that in a sedan even with the seats down. There is a real difference in cargo space/packaging. \n\nThat being said, I rarely put shit back there so it's wasted on me. A sedan would've been fine.
