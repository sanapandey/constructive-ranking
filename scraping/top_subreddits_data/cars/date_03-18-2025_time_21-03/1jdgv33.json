It also brakes for ghosts. It honestly should be retired. \n\nFSD's significantly better, I wish he had tested that. Not a self driving car still regardless of the name. I don't know if it would have passed the Looney Toons wall but it would have definitely slowed down for the rain or fog in my experience. \n\nIt doesn't have to be either/or. The ai/camera based training is still relevant in a lidar car. Lidar plus cameras is the only way companies like Waymo have real self driving cars. Which cars in America have lidar senors?

Some of the vehicles with radar have had a similar problem: Tesla in the past and Ford, now, have radar, which, in theory, should tell you if there's a car (or wall) stopped in your lane, but they can give so many false positives, that the software just ignores the radar and occasionally, that means crashing into a stopped vehicle. NHTSA is investigating Ford, now, and says Ford's system just ignores radar above \\~60mph.",

Still the most comfortable car I\u2019ve owned for road trip purposes. \n\n\n3. 2019 Toyota RAV4 - whatever gen TSS this was sucked. Lane centering was reactive not proactive so it would play pong with the lane markers \n\n\n4. 2022 Tesla Model Y - absolute dogshit autopilot. DNF since I turned it off after the 4th time it slammed on the brakes within 50 miles\u2026 absolute clear road and apparently it\u2019s affected by mirages? FSD is supposed to be a different system? Why? How can I trust \u201cfull self drive\u201d when it can\u2019t even figure out adaptive cruise?",

What's your point?\n\nNobody believes cruise control is something you can trust unattended for even a moment. And even then, cruise control does exactly what it says it does. Nothing more, nothing less. And it works all the time. Even radar cruise control is very simplistic. You can easily reason about the side effects of using it. \n\nThe problem with AP and FSD has always been it works ok-ish in normal scenarios and then you constantly discover corner cases that cause phantom braking or an unexpected lane change that decapitates you against a semi or it swerves you into a broken impact attenuator at an interchange.\n\nMark Rober's video testing even shows the source of the repeated nonsense PR bullshit that Tesla throws out every time AP or FSD is responsible for a crash, which is that it was not engaged at the time of the collision. Which yes, if you detect a crash is imminent and disable it a second before the crash technically it was not engaged.",

It's way better at understanding the context of what it sees.\n\nI rented a brand new M3 highland with HW4, drove it 300 miles in FSD. \n\nIt didn't make a single mistake or have a single hickup. Not a single moment of lack of confidence. Not a single weird turn into the wrong lane. Not a single \"mistake\" made when it comes to traffic laws. Not a single phantom brake. And I drove it in the city, on the highway, in suburbia, in the mountains. I drove it downtown, through one-ways and construction, at night, in the rain, with pedestrians and mopeds. It didn't miss a beat. I'm blown away. I have unbelievably high standards and its shocked me. The only negative things I have to say is its lane discipline isn't quite predictive enough with how it judges traffic, and it will left lane camp illegally. And the speed control was a bit faffy, especially in parking lots it's so slow, but I'm fine with being more cautious than speedy. \n\nSo when people talk about these other issues, I know they're talking about either autopilot which is dogshit 10 year old tech, or some very old version of FSD \"oh I tried it on my old Tesla and it performed awfully\". Because the 13 dot whatever its on now is... it's game over. Them and Waymo, they've got there pretty much. It's better than 95% of drivers I know. And it's a really difficult problem because while Elong is a toolbag and quite damaging for the world, the product is shockingly good. Most people cannot disassociate the two. Which is sad because the product is simply incredible.\n\nCompare that to Lucid's system which I drove 18 months ago. It tried to kill me within 5 minutes of using their system. First it thought that exit lanes were the normal travel lane, a rookie mistake of any lanekeep system. Then it crossed a double yellow line into oncoming in a turn and I had to take over to prevent a head-on. Compare that to Chevy Super Cruze which disabled itself randomly on I-90 for no obvious reason, and was \"weaving\" in it's lane, and wouldn't adjust over to the side of the lane when passing semi trucks.",

It struggles at speed. \n\nI'm not saying sensors are bad overall, that's why waymo relies on multiple sensors. But there are very few cars actually available with lidar. And the camera/radar based ones are currently dangerous, and really don't solve any issues over the camera only ones.",

As you got closer the landmarks that appear distant in the static image would have very different positions from frame to frame compared to how much you\u2019d expect it to shift within the camera\u2019s perspective for an object that was truly distant, but this effect only become noticeable through the noise in the data (because the car itself is moving and shaking) once you\u2019re far too close for a stop to be possible. \n\nObviously it\u2019s not a realistic scenario, but it is one that highlights the necessity of multiple data sources to reference against when handling safety-critical functions (such as autonomous operation). It is absolutely a \u201cworst case scenario\u201d for any kind of CV-only system, but that\u2019s because that kind of test is rather tailored towards the specific weakness of such a system. \n\nThe answer is not to use only one or the other, as lidar/radar have their own weaknesses (such as the long shadows objects can cast when observed from a point source), but instead to utilize a blend of multiple different sensor types to allow systems to overcome their individual weaknesses and map their surroundings as accurately as possible.",

A test's legitimacy is dictated by the testing procedure, not who pays for stuff and loans tools (and whether or not it was a legit test is a different discussion.) A test isn't invalidated because the opposition tested it, a test gets invalidated because the procedure is flawed.\n\nE.G. Apple benchmarks their CPUs against competitors, it's not invalid because Apple did it, it would be invalid if they benchmark x86's on ARM benchmarks.",

Seems like Toyota is actually adopting a Chinese lidar company called RoboSense for their EVs instead.  But Luminar does actually supply their tech to Volvo's production ex90. I does feel a bit sponsored but still I appreciate the science from mark. Curious why they didn't just test with the ex90, maybe they needed a preproduction test vehicle to get the lidar data/graphics for the video",

Not being able to tell if an object is a 2d representation or a real 3d thing is a hardware problem resulting from using a single camera, no software can solve that. You need either multiple lenses (like a 3d film camera) or LiDAR/radar to give a range for solid objects in front of you",

It's a middle ground between camera and radar, but doesn't have the range and penetration of radar, or the capture details in images like cameras do. While it provides an accurate 3D depth map, I don't find it particularly convincing for an automotive ADAS application. Radar plus cameras should work just fine if sensor fusion is done correctly. \n\nStill can't forgive Tesla for taking away radar though. I don't think a camera-vision only approach is the way for full autonomy without driver supervision.",

[Volvo's EX90](https://www.volvocars.com/us/cars/ex90-electric/features/), which uses LiDAR developed by the same company in Mark's video, may do the same behavior you described. They also make the use of cameras for their safety features. Practically every other automaker makes the use of cameras for their ADAS. \n\nPeople aren't knocking on Tesla for using cameras. Tesla should use cameras *and* other hardware to improve their ADAS system.",
