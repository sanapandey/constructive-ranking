I\u2019m shocked that he was able to review it before the amg one and really I would\u2019ve preferred a amg one review firstly but all we can do is a two fist knock on wood that sooner then later he will be able to review one, enormous ups to Doug Demuro.

I think a lot of people forget that downvotes are to show a lack of support for inaccurate information and not because you don\u2019t like something lol. That\u2019s why people on instagram when they feel negative about a post are a lot more likely to express their negative feelings via a comment rather then just not liking the post or comment. \n\nI don\u2019t know why people found Doug only not relatable when he got rich when bro being able to review cars that are only middle class and wealthy people could afford wasn\u2019t relatable to them for years lol",

Problem is once C&B started he pretty much stopped doing negative reviews and expressing very negative opnions on cars. What's more he revises some of his old reviews or complaints when there's a car from the site to review (and promote).",

In fact, I generally find the reviews quite a bit more biting now that I am more financially uninhibited. Plus, the criticism is objectively inaccurate -- I post negative reviews more frequently than before, often including the cars we're auctioning. \n\nThe only thing that changed is Reddit users love the underdog and hate the rich. It's Reddit-specific, because it hasn't affected my popularity elsewhere. It's sad, I loved posting here, but I have completely come to terms with it, I have no regrets, and I've moved on. If you asked any human on earth whether they'd rather be financially independent or beloved on r/cars, I suspect they'd pick the same thing I did. \ud83d\ude0a",

People say he only does high end cars and doesn't do weird and quirky or older cars anymore, but if you look at his channel that's not true at all. \n\nHis videos were never the most technically accurate or in-depth with performance data.
