                                    "body": "Oh, yes, I remember! I had forgotten that Chrysler had the \"brilliant\" idea of just to sell the Chrysler Voyager/Pacifica as a \"Chrysler Grand Caravan\", because the name plate/brand was that successfull in Canada in the past.  Instead of this, I really would have made/sold a Dodge version of the current Pacifica/Voyage, so with a slightly \"dodgified\" front grill and Dodge badges, perhaps slightly decontented. And of course a version with a sportier appearance package and special editions with special Dodge colors, like \"plum crazy\" or in a lovely dark cherry red. I mean, this worked for many years and the Dodge version was successfully selling due to beeing a good value for money option when it came to minivans. \n\nMy emergency measure to get more sales and to revive interest in Chrysler and Dodge would be to promptly give the order to create Chrysler & Dodge versions of current newer and upcoming Jeep SUVs. Just take the current Jeep Grand Cherokee and create a Chrysler and a Dodge version of it. Do the same with the upcoming new Jeep Compass. It can't cost a billion to just make a different front and a different rear design, I mean ditching the seven slot grille, put a Chrysler/Dodge grill there instead, change the headlight design front and back. That's what GM is doing more or less with the Cadillac Escalade, which is just a plush version of another existing, less expensive car. And of course the pricing has to be adjusted/has to be \"on point\" with regards what people are willing to pay. The Chrysler versions could be more \"comfort\" and \"near premium\" oriented and the Dodge version could be a little bit more \"sports\" oriented (some wild/loud color options, special editions, sporty body-kit tacked on). And while I am at it, I want \"Jeep Wrangler Frat Boy\" and \"Jeep Wrangler Sorority Girl\" editions and \"Soccer Mom\" and \"Soccer Dad\" versions of some SUV models and of course the Chrysler Pacifica/Voyager (and if the Dodge Caravan is revived, a \"Dodge Caravan \"Uncle Bob\" edition or \"Unsuitable Uncle\" edition that comes with a low credit score and a scented tree hanging from the rear-view mirror with a \"tobacco scent\").",

                                    "body": "Yes, that's also what I assume. That is the reason why the pre-facelift Chrysler Pacifica was introduced as the Chrysler Voyager. When introduced back then as a cheaper option, it was considerably cheaper than the facelifted Pacifica, but now the Voyager has a starting MSRP of 39k USD and the Pacifica has a starting MSRP of 42k USD (according to the Chrysler website). So the difference is not that big anymore. I am not sure, if a Dodge version could be sold for around 30k USD, because that would be really affordable, and still be profitable. The Kia Carnival, which is a much newer model than the Chrysler Pacifica/Voyager, has a starting MSRP of 36k USD. But still, instead of selling the pre-facelift Pacifica as Chrysler Voyager, they could have simply changed it slightly and could have slapped a Dodge badge on it and still sell it for the same price. I mean, it's not like the Chrysler badge commands a higher price or a better perception and it would be have been a quick way to enlarge the Dodge product line-up. This would have been much better than slapping a Dodge badge on a thinly veiled Alfa Romeo Tonale that nobody buys. And most buyers would not care, if there is enough diffentiation between each brand.",

It would have been much smarter to create a Dodge version of the Jeep Compass when the current Jeep Compass was introduced. The current Dodge Hornet is a very lazy and unnecessary attempt. Yes, Dodge needed a compact SUV/CUV, as this is a high volume segment, but not this way. The pricing is off for most if not all of Stellantis brands. Currently, non of its brands can command a premium pricing. Chasing higher margins by increasing prices works only if customers are willing to pay these prices. Neither Dodge nor Alfa Romeo are \"premium\" in any way. Both are supposed to be \"sporty\" brands, one USA focused sporty brand and the other beeing former known sporty european brand with a rich history of great cars. Both brands need \"bread-and-butter\" models in order be economically viable as brands. And both brands need to be cheaper than the brands they are competing with, as both brands do not have the image to command higher prices. Time and time again, mistakes were made, e.g. refusing to offer a stationwagon version of the current Giulia whose production will end soon without an successor (new Giulia comes in 2027, current gen ends production this summer). They could have simply sold more Giulias by offering a stationwagon, as some european countries like Germany prefer stationwagons over sedans/limousines. That's why you will still see more Alfa Romeo 159s in Germany than the sedan version of it. \n\nWith lower pricing, some shortcomings would have been more acceptable and sales would have been better. You do not become a premium brand over night just by demanding premium prices, you have to build up such a reputation before you can do that. That is painfully long process and can take up to two decades. Instead of pretending to be a premium brand, they should have tried to be a \"more affordable\" alternative to other European premium brands, e.g. an Italian affordable alternative to BMW. For the US specifically, they would have needed a compact sporty CUV and a compact sedan, both around 23.000 to 35.000 USD price point and above that also a mid-size to full-size SUV and also a sporty sedan. In order to achieve that, they would have to be built in Mexico or somewhere else more convenient cost wise for the US market, at least the both entry-models in the line-up. Stellantis in its current form and when it was still just FCA has the general problem that they have not built any competitive car in the compact car segment in the US, e.g. a competent car to rival the likes of Toyota Camry and Honda Civic.",
