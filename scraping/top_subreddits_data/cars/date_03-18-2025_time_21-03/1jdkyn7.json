Chevrolet has indeed let loose a blight upon the landscape. \n\n\nMakes me long for the days of print media where you could utterly eviscerate a car without being worried about being blacklisted and cut off from press cars forever. You\u2019d never get a clip like that from a modern YT car \u201cjourno\u201d who wanted to have a future in the industry.",

Had Pi\u00ebch lived to see this, the homicide rate in Wolfsburg would have had a dramatic spike when the id4 launched.\n\n>Am I being harsh? Yes, but remember the BMW E65 7-series (catastrophe); the W220 S-Class (Dodge Neon-quality POS) or the \u201908 WRX (an insult to its own brand.)\n\n>This is one of those moments.\n\n>Does the thing drive ok? Sure: VW has built hundreds of millions of cars. Surely they\u2019ve learned a thing or two. It\u2019s fine.\n\n>But from the cartoon styling to the disasterous UX, its gimmick-to-function factor is the inverse of what VW has been since its genesis.\n\n>The well-documented lack of rear window controls and non-illuminated controls are just the beginning.\n\n>The gauges and shifter are a craptastic version of the BMW i3's, which were laughable a decade ago. See slide 10 for the full range of display customization \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n>You can\u2019t adjust the driver aids while moving.\n\n>I almost threw a brick through the fucking window when it wouldn\u2019t open its door on a hill unless I pushed *as* it was unlatching.\n\n>The rat\u2019s nest under the hood tells us everything we need to know.\n\n>An all-new, from-the-ground-up platform should not need visible reinforcements. This scares me \u2014 where else did VW skimp?\n\n>Add up the negative space up front, it\u2019d make a big frunk. There isn\u2019t one tells us that the teams at VW worked against each other, not for the good of the whole.\n\n>Disclosure: I own an e-Golf. It\u2019s everything a VW should be (with exception of range.) Quick, well-crafted, gimmick-free, efficient, handles well, easy to use, and packed full of features that make daily life easier.\n\n>No gimmicks, unlike this. VWs should earn you respect from grownups; not be rolling cartoons of poor design.\n\n>This thing is a comicbook joke. I\u2019d only recommend buying one is because IONIQ 5 isn\u2019t available yet and you need something to ram into a tree for fun. Given the visible reinforcements up front, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d recommend actually being in the id4 for the impact.\n\n>Man, does it miss the mark.",
