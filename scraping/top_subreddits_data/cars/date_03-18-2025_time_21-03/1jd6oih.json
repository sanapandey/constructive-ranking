They've even released sportier version of Renault 5 already.\n\nThen they show this with Renault logo, not Alpine.",

It doesn't make very much sense from a modern branding perspective, but historically it's accurate.",

The car is incredible but that is awfully limited.\n\n\nThat's par for the course with current battery tech. Track-oriented EVs are designed to last a standard track day session, which is 20 minutes. Most batteries aren't designed for the punishment of a track session where you need max discharge and recharge rate all the time. That causes a lot of resistive heating which cripples performance.\n\n\nRemember we're in the *very* early days of electric performance cars. Just a few years ago Formula-E cars couldn't even finish a race. All this takes years of iteration and a lot of investment. Think of when race cars looked like [this](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTj1L7CIwr2thr9ByGjU7o1Bjqym_Bhf1GG8Q&s) and helmets were made of leather.\n\n\nThis may or may not be comforting for a prospective buyer of the Renault. But the TL;DR is that's where things are with battery tech at that price point, and manufacturers are still figuring it out. Cars like this are an important step in that process.",

But if race cars were less loud I'd be more inclined to attend motorsport - although it wouldn't be Nascar. I don't care for having to wear ear protection and hearing the synchronized noise and vibration of a couple dozen cars. The vast majority of motorsports fans don't feel that way, and that just means live motorsports isn't for me - which is fine.",
