            "body": "Wife's 2017 Mitsubishi outlander has a buzzing or grinding sound on deceleration not using the brake. It's not very loud, you'd need to pay attention to notice it. I'm assuming it's related to the CVT, though the sound isn't constant it's just at initial lift off the accelerator. Noticed it on the highway when letting off the gas around 70mph.",
