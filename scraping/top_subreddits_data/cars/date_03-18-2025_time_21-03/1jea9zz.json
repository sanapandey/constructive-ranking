It's not a bad engine by any stretch of the imagination, but I just find it to be a bit meh.\n\nThe Giulia needs a great engine as a selling point, and the Ferrari V6 in the last gen was a great one. After all, it needs to be able to invoke an emotion on a test drive, enough to make you forget about its bad reputation for reliability.\n\nI just don't know if an engine off a Jeep is enough.",

The sound was pretty solid for a turbo 4 banger, but it was not a charismatic engine. Extremely turbo charged so power came at you like a rubber band, and it only revved out to like 5500. Just wasn't special feeling at all despite being relatively quick.",

Given that the 2.0T engines have been fairly reliable, maybe it was a good bet by them.",

The EA888 continues to be modernized- the 2025 engine gets more hp and torque than the 2024 model. The B48 also got significant upgrades in 2019. meanwhile Alfa's 2.0T has been literally unchanged since 2016. In that sense, there's no competition- obviously the more modern more refined engine is better.\n\nBut putting Stellantis' gross incompetence aside, I think the engines are comparable if we're comparing apples to apples. In 2017 the B48 top trim put out 255 hp/296 lb/ft and the 2017 EA888 in the Golf R put out 290 hp/ 280 lb/feet- the 2017 Giulia put out 280 hp with 305 lb/feet of torque.\n\nModded giulias are reliably getting 340-350 hp with upgraded turbos and ECU remaps, so it's not crazy to think that Alfa could have also modernized this engine to that degree if they had wanted to.\n\nI do think Alfa's MultiAir system is superior to Valvetronic and Volkswagen's VVT system. I'm no engineer so i could be totally wrong, but MultiAir seems like it's halfway to Koenigsegg's freevalve tech whereas Valvetronic/vvt is just iVTEC but more modern.",
