Others are unchecked power hungry assholes. \n\nThe best leaders are people who are personable and down to earth, and recognize and listen to experts. You need someone who can bring everyone to the table. This will require listening to scientists, but it doesn't necessitate being a scientist.\n\nThe issue is that scientists are good at arguing, but we're not trained to find common ground, rather we're trained to find truth and facts. When we disagree, we don't have to eventually come to agreement, rather you end up with two competing sides until one can conclusively disprove the other. So in that respect, we don't have experience meeting people in the middle. A lot of decisions a leader needs to make doesn't necessarily depend on truth, because you're trying to manage people and emotions, both of which are irrational. It depends more on ethics and virtue. \n\nI would argue good leaders would be philosophers.",

Edison had already built a DC network in New York city and some other places but AC was the future and GE itself knew it. Edison was personally skeptical of AC, but GE wasn't. [William Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Jr.) worked for them, and was an AC pioneer who's transfomer design set the standard for the future. \n\nEdison was a shameless self-promotor, but Tesla wasn't far behind, taking credit for others work, and making his own fantastical claims. His fanboys have exaggerated him even further. Tesla didn't invent AC. He and Westinghouse didn't build the first AC system, or even the first commercial AC system in the USA. \n\nA lot of this is just spreading of an very old newspaper invention, in combination with the fact that Americans continue to perpetuate a lot of Edison's mythology about himself, and Tesla then gets brought up as an underappreciated counterpoint. But Telsa's extremely famous, he's on the money in Serbia, he's got an SI unit named after him. Much more so than other major AC pioneers like Stanley, [Dolivo-Dobrovolsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Dolivo-Dobrovolsky), [Ferraris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Ferraris), [de Ferranti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Ziani_de_Ferranti) and others. Meanwhile, Edison isn't a figure of note in electrical engineering history at all. An inventor and entrepreneur to be sure, but he didn't have the knowledge of mathematics and electrical theory to even be able to contribute. In fact a lot of the reason why he liked DC power may have simply been because he understood it better.",

The venture capitalists took over and Silicon Valley went from an engineer-driven place to a speculation-driven one. IMO they were formerly more likely to come up with great tech that they didn't know how to sell (e.g. the Xerox Alto) than vice-versa. Now you've got companies raking in billions in capital promising things that be obviously-great if it actually existed but where the tech just isn't there yet (if ever) like Theranos and Tesla. Or it's some greedy, technically-uninteresting crap thought up by some 'ideas guy' suit or marketer, like putting monitors on store refrigerator doors. Then there's stuff that's not even tech being promoted as if it were (WeWork).\n\nThere's too much money and it's being doled out by people with too little actual tech knowledge. All a scammer needs to do is spout some jargon and say his new tech will take over a $10B market, and the Wall Street analysts say \"Well even if there's only an 1% chance of that happening, that means I estimate $100M is a fair valuation\".",

And the product people get driven out of the decision making forums, and the companies forget what it means to make great products.*\n\n*They have no conception of the craftsmanship that's required to take a good idea and turn it into a good product. And they really have no feeling in their hearts, usually, about wanting to really help the customers.\u201d*\n\nApple is now a lifestyle company. Microsoft chases whatever they think the latest fad is.\u00a0Google\u2019s search results embody the very problem they originally set out to solve. Facebook blew $15 billion on the Metaverse.\n\nAnd all four of them - seeing Sam Altman\u2019s quack pitch - have invested billions of dollars into a trained parrot that cannot do what they need it to do to turn a profit.\n\nThe entire industry has become yet another example of American-style capitalist parasitism (like healthcare insurance, like higher education); and consumer resentment is now at an all-time high towards the technology providers that likewise insist on making everything just a little worse, day after day!",

                    "body": "The goal is isolation through Peter Thiel\u2019s and Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s version of globalization, the claims he wants Greenland (metals for tech)/Canada/Panama Canal are not a bluff. In fact I think he will talk about annexing Mexico next. Eventually to dissuade folks over those fears (basically these rants are a test to see how it can be taken) the plan will be more install puppet governments with the end goal of using them for labor and manufacturing hubs. The steps taken will be similar to what\u2019s happening to federal agencies and federal employees here. This is where Peter Thiel/Palantir comes in. Using AI to replace federal employees and advanced software like Palantir to run the day to day operations of the intelligence agencies and armies in those countries (explanation below about the U.S. and UK along with links). The folks behind Trump are Peter Theil/Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the standard technique of privatization: Defund, make sure things don\u2019t work, People get angry, you hand it over to private capital\u201d\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/26/elon-musk-peter-thiel-apartheid-south-africa\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/02/seeing-stones-pandemic-reveals-palantirs-troubling-reach-in-europe\n\nhttps://uwpexponent.com/opinions/2025/03/13/who-is-peter-thiel/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies\n\nSpecifically Trump is throwing all these policies up and Palantir analytics software is see what works/fails and why along with what to change next time. The goal maybe isolationism but the path to it through seeing what works and what doesn\u2019t under trump then refining it for Vance. JD Vance\u2019s benefactor for more than 10 years has been Peter Theil (founder and still majority owner of Palantir, explained with shares and link further down) the 2nd biggest defense contractor for the CIA/NSA handling their day to day operations along with several UK intelligence agencies and armed forces this doesn\u2019t even cover the data Palantir received from Greece at the height of Covid (links above) or that Palantir provides support to the IDF for \u201cwar-related missions\u201d (links above), for the US military Elon Musk provides them starshield (military version of starlink).\n\nhttps://washingtonspectator.org/peter-thiel-and-the-american-apocalypse/\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2009/07/13/106479613/a-tech-fix-for-illegal-government-snooping\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125200842406984303\n\nPeter was born in West Germany and grew up in a South African town that still believes in Hitler. Cantor Fitzgerald lost so many people on 9/11. I think they realized isolationism is the key. Cantor\u2019s chairman is our secretary of commerce. He quit cantor only a month ago and now his son is in charge.\n\nThiel directly own roughly 180 million publicly traded shares which 7%. His investment firm Rivendell 7 owns 34 million publicly traded shares. Other Thiel vehicles own 37 million shares. Thiel entities also own 32.5 million supervoting Class B shares in Palantir. Those class b shares carry 10 votes while public ones carry only 1 vote per share. Now here is the kicker for why he still controls Palantir (link below), Thiel has sole investment power over 335,000 class F shares as part of a trust that has 49.99% voting interest in the company.\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-stock-chairman-peter-thiel-b63415c7\n\nLeaked documents showed Palantir's clients as of 2013 included at least twelve groups within the U.S. government, including the CIA, the DHS, the NSA, the FBI, the CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, the Special Operations Command, the United States Military Academy, the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization and Allies\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2015/01/11/leaked-palantir-doc-reveals-uses-specific-functions-and-key-clients/\n\nIt would explain why Trump ordered hectares of federal land be stripped for timber. It makes sense why they would want to drill and mine federal lands/national parks for oil and metals. Making Canada and Mexico into manufacturing zones. Just a couple weeks ago Blackrock (an American company) bought 43 ports in 23 countries that includes 2 of the 4 Panama Canal ports for $23 billion dollars. Those 2 ports, Cristobal and Balboa, one on the Atlantic side and one on the Pacific side are the 2 most important ports at the Panama Canal.\n\nhttps://www.michiganfarmnews.com/critical-panama-canal-ports-of-entry-purchased-by-us-investor-giant-blackrock\n\nAnother big factor in isolation is now controlling the internet which starlink has started. Starlink has partnered with TMobile to provide service bad connection areas. TMobile announced that it would let rival\u2019s AT&T and Verizon customers use starlink as well.\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/networking/t-mobiles-free-starlink-satellite-service-opens-up-to-at-t-and-verizon-customers/\n\nHaving Israel/Gaza/West Bank as sort of an embassy to the world with Peter Theil\u2019s hooks in the UK because about a year and a half ago they got the contract to manage UK\u2019s health system along with all the work Palantir is already doing for their intelligence agencies and army (links below), the UK is our link to the world. Greenland is the buffer zone with Panama Canal as the border to the south. Tariffs in the short term hurt the economy but long term would force manufacturing to increase within our borders.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2024/07/16/jd-vance-and-peter-thiel-what-to-know-about-the-relationship-between-trumps-vp-pick-and-the-billionaire/\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/07/palantir-delivers-first-two-ai-enabled-systems-to-us-army.html\n\nAn era of isolationism is the goal, there is even a section on it in Project 2025 which was written by Cantor Fitzgerald and the heritage foundation.\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/blackrock-panama-canal-deal-ck-hutchison-trump/\n\nhttps://poorandpissed.wordpress.com/2025/03/07/the-shadow-players-behind-project-2025-wall-street-cantor-fitzgerald-the-heritage-foundation-and-the-privatization-of-americas-public-resources/\n\nhttps://www.westword.com/news/opinion-palantir-technologies-puts-colorado-at-center-of-future-of-ai-23822908\n\nhttps://corporatewatch.org/palantir-in-the-uk/\n\nhttps://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/127784/html/\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/business/palantir-nhs-uk-health-contract-thiel.html\n\nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/article/trump-quietly-plans-to-liquidate-public-lands-to-finance-his-sovereign-wealth-fund/\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5RpPTRcz1no",

Personally I try to find logical explanations for why people do what they do, because that is what allows political counter-action - in the case of the tech billionaires sucking the dong of Trump, it's clear as day they all lost the trust that the Democrats show a backbone when the Trump administration begins to get to work and impede the worst of the worst, but clearly that hasn't happened.\n\nIt's almost four months since the election and the Democrats are *still* reeling from the loss and are in complete disorder, they're all running around like a bunch of decapitated chickens (yes, chicken can and do live on if you [cut their heads off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_the_Headless_Chicken)).\n\nI don't blame the Democrats for losing the election, that can happen in a democratic election, especially with a largely braindead population. What I *do* blame them for is that they have - as usual - invested zero resources in planning for even a single day a*fter* the election. It's always the same shit: Republicans plan ahead and *act* once they take office, Democrats wait until the last two weeks before the midterms to even make up their minds in the desperate hope that this will be enough in the minds of the voters (despite that not working for neither Obama nor Biden).",
