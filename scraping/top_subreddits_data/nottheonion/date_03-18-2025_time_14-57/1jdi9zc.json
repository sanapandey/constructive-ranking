That's not a party at all. It just means they aren't affiliated with either party when it comes to being registered. But it doesn't say anything about whether they align with one party more than the other.\n\nIf you want to make change you need to broaden your understanding and knowledge on how these systems come into place.\n\nDo you know what would happen if we suddenly abolished both parties with a snap? It would inevitably come back to 2 parties after several years. But do you understand why?\n\nYou need to think deeper beyond just surface level. Start asking questions.\n\nWhy do Republicans seemingly always get control of the Senate? Why are Democrats losing the house when theoretically it should be in their favor? What systems and rules are in place and how do they affect us?\n\nWhat are the alternatives? What do other countries do?\n\nRather than just thinking outside the box, start thinking about why and how the box is there. What it's made of. Start thinking more critically and dynamically.",

Biden\u2019s ceiling is also high but his floor is suuuuuper low, but his voters aren\u2019t loyal to him and he can\u2019t count on their undying loyalty. They just didn\u2019t like Trump.

This is why we need to be using this time between now, 2026, and 2028 to push for ballot initiatives to switch to ranked robin voting, STAR voting, score voting, or even ranked choice voting.\n\nI think getting a labor party growing makes sense still, since you will want them to start running in these elections. But to really give other parties a chance, we need to change the laws. Ballot initiatives are possible by citizens in about half of the states, and only require getting enough signatures to be put up for a vote. The other half of the states require the state congress to pass a ballot initiative, which can be started by writing to your state representatives and senators.",

Not my problem if you're quite literally too stupid to read and understand.\n\n66% of Americans (that Pew poll, February 2025 I linked) want to protect biological women when it comes to their spaces in athletics.\n\nHere are left leaning new sources so you don't throw a fit:\n\n[https://www.npr.org/2024/11/14/nx-s1-5183060/why-working-class-voters-have-been-shifting-toward-the-republican-party](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/14/nx-s1-5183060/why-working-class-voters-have-been-shifting-toward-the-republican-party)\n\nNPR - Why working-class voters have been shifting toward the Republican Party\n\n>Exit polls, which are not that reliable, but it's what we have - exit polls show **President-elect Trump drew support from voters without a college degree and those who make less than $100,000 per year**.\n\n>It predates Trump, but I think Trump really tapped into it and accelerated the transition. I think the economic issues are certainly part of it. **These workers feel like they've been left behind.** Globalization has benefited many groups, but not them. There's a certain resentment and anger, and I think Trump has tapped into that. I also think that he's touched on **some changes in terms of working-class voters** prioritizing **social and cultural issues - DEI and racial issues, the number of immigrants coming into many working-class communities, transgenderism**, guns, abortion. **Trump has really become a part of working-class culture in this country**\n\n>You can look at the data in terms of - by income that defines working-class voters. In the 2008 election, Obama got 63% of voters making less than $50,000, and McCain got 35%. That's a 28% margin. In 2012, Obama got 60%. It fell to a 22% margin. In 2024, Harris got 48.5% and Trump 49%, **meaning that between 2008 and 2024, the Democrats lost almost 30% of working-class voters. And that's enough to explain the outcomes of the election by itself**.",

You can be in denial all you want, but your gaslighting of the working and middle class who clearly do not want far left social politics means the Democrats will continue to self-sabotage and lose elections until they stop pandering to far left social politics.",

When was the last time the Democrats actually advocated for real healthcare reform or reducing wealth inequality or tightening regulations on the wild west that is silicon valley?\n\nThey specifically avoid all of these terms and have been for years. They absolutely love issues that don\u2019t fundamentally threaten the ruling class as a whole like civil liberties and climate change (not saying we shouldn\u2019t care about those things). Corporations love greenwashing their operations and getting to \u201cnet-zero\u201d whatever that\u2019s supposed to mean. They love a good pride campaign where they can sell rainbow themed crap that does nothing to actually help people in the LGBT community.\n\nWe sit here and we praise the Dems because while they\u2019re not exactly doing their best, they\u2019re doing *something*. The Republican agenda has become so insane that we have accepted and praised this corporate-washed and uninspired version of the Democratic party because they *look* much better by comparison.\n\nIt sounds crazy, and maybe it is, but I have a feeling that on some level, the DNC actually appreciates that the GOP has gone off the deep end. It\u2019s taken all of the pressure off of them to push policy forward. They didn\u2019t get rid of the filibuster because it allowed them to throw their hands up when the bills they supposedly wanted to pass were blocked. They didn\u2019t codify abortion access into law because they knew they could campaign on the issue and could just blame the Republicans.",

Rs actually do what they say by cutting taxes and cutting regulations, while Ds have the more difficult role of saying one thing while trying to do the opposite or feigning incompetence to appears their corporate masters. \n\nObamacare is a classic example. Ds promote it as the savior of US healthcare, but it was written by an insurance lobbyist to enrich insurance companies. Healthcare costs continue to skyrocket. Rs rail against it for years, then they have their chance in Trump's first administration. Oh wait, they don't have a counter plan, then when they do, it's basically the same plan. \n\nMeanwhile we're all at each other's throats about Ds and Rs while they're both f'ing us from either end.",

Which is why there is no reason to inflate that to a ludicrous degree.\n\nThis just reinforces the \u201cAmericans have literally 0 clue how much is being spent on foreign aid and consistently vastly overestimate it\u201d.

I favor democratic socialists of America (bc the green party is a bunch of grifters, and because the dsa is actually working to elect local politicians to build coalitions). Voting third party for president at this moment in time is a waste of your vote - but if we get a real third party off the ground like the dsa, it won't be, because that party will actually have support in Congress to get things done, AND they can actually collect delegates (which is why third party voting for president is a waste of a vote rn).",

However, the worst precedent, in my mind, is to just play hot potato with power between two diametrically opposed ideologies instead of trying to find a common ground that America can operate on. Both sides are guilty of exacerbating that problem too, so in my mind its unproductive to go after Schumer for this specifically. I'm not even sure how to fix it, so maybe crossing our arms and refusing to play ball is the right strategy.\n\nHowever, the democrats were uniquely in a lose-lose here, because a government shutdown risked giving Trump and Musk even more freedom to make cuts, so there was no leverage to make the Republicans negotiate.

And it's fine to disagree with that, but I guess I just don't see this particular issue as damning for Schumer, it's a political calculation. I can see a solid argument voting for it and against it, so it's not as stupid as all of the other decisions he and the party made that got them here. To me it seems like an unproductive direction to push the Democratic party, at least on this particular bill, which was mostly maintaining the status quo. Let's hold them more accountable in the future when they're not stuck between a rock and a hard place, and the bills are about cutting Social Security or Medicare.",

I think operating on that belief is much less likely than risking accelerating it all with a shutdown. \n\nThe risks of voting no were that Trump spins it as incompetent Democrats obstructing government and he uses the shutdown to make more progress in wider cuts. And voting yes is seen as collaborating with the party that 50% of Americans voted for. Whether you call them devils or not, isn't that democracy? In a more normal situation, I'd criticize the Democrats for not getting more concessions from Republicans in the bill's specifics. But I think the Republicans were happy to let the Democrats gridlock congress, so they refused negotiations. It's a unique situation.\n\nAnd regardless, my overarching point is just that it's not 100% black and white, so why take Schumer to task over the way he voted specifically. We should be dissecting other mistakes that got the Democrats here, where they have no leverage and have to weigh two bad options. We're all getting pissed about a symptom rather than trying to treat the root cause.",

They have forsaken the path of cooperation long ago (which means they don't really fit into any democratic system any more, by the by), and if you try to be benevolent towards them, they exploit that ruthlessly. \n\nHonestly, as someone from the other side of the globe, I think the most prudent course of action would be to glueglo the entire party, and create a new one, a New Deal kinda thing. Take AOC, Kelly, Crockett, Sanders and whoever else is ready and willing to fight, and rebuild by really focusing on the \"by the people, *for the people*\" part. Affordable Health Care, VA, retirement, all that great shit a good human needs to live a decent life. Gods know, your system has enough issues they have their work cut out for decades.\n\nBut, yeah.

In a lot of cases the PDs, knowing that prosecutors had 3-4x as many cases as the PDs (who were unionized and therefore had case limits), would just try to run the clock as long as possible in the hopes I just wouldn't have enough hours in the day to get that case ready for trial in addition to all the other cases I had. When that didn't work and I did get the case ready for trial within the speedy trial time window, some of them couldn't convince their clients to take a dismissal + programming plea, because they hadn't spent enough time explaining to their clients why the plea wasn't actually that bad compared to the consequences of pleading to a misdemeanor; so their clients would ask for a misdemeanor and time served over a dismissal with anger management therapy. Since I didn't have a way to make them go to anger management therapy at that point other than going to trial, and the judges generally didn't want to go through a trial when the defendant was willing to plea to the top count + time served, the judge would jump on the opportunity to plead the case out from under me to avoid the trial. \n\nThe system sucks all around and no part of it is set up in a way that anyone can do a proper job all the time.",

My guess is that there were several more Democratic Senators who wanted the CR to pass, but were too chicken to vote for it.

Schumer is merely there to take the heat from the public while the rest of them can carry on the pretense. Democrats in Congress spend a good amount of their time figuring out ways to bamboozle their own voters while servicing their donors (Pelosi is particularly skilled at this). The only Democrats in the Senate who I'm certain are on the side of the angels are Sanders, Warren, Markey, and maybe Murphy.",

The magic hand is usually some kind of crime, so he should be investigated as well, as his actions infer crime is occurring...\n\nThere's way too many \"flip floppers\" in the democratic party for them all to be legitimate. *It's clear that they are not who they say they are...* The corruption problem needs to be dealt with critically and nothing else matters until that issue is resolved... We have a group of people in power that is engaging in organized crime in plain sight and it's time for that to end...\n\nChuck Schumer needs to either figure out what matters, or get out of the way... He's playing dangerous games with people that he should have put in prison a very long time ago...",

Policies that the Dem establishment dismiss as \"too far left\" are consistently far more popular than they are in issue-based polling. The issue is that they have no credibility to advocate for those policies. No one believes they'll follow through, or are even competent enough to pass them with a majority (remember the minimum wage increase under Biden? Lol)\n\n\n>They're trying to cast as wide a web as possible to beat the GOP. It didn't work the last time, but it's the best they could've done.\u00a0\n\n\nRunning the third \"spend all of our time pandering to a nonexistent demographic of Moderate Republicans\" campaign in a row is not, actually, the best they could have done.\u00a0\n\n\nRepublicans win by exciting their base, not by telling their base to shut up and fall in line while they go out and try to woo the other party's voters. Maybe Dems should try that, because it actually works.",

It\u2019s why everyone hates every mayor we elect the second they are mayor at a state level or federal level most face zero opposition. It\u2019s why the NY Dems basically collapsed in 2022 because the crappy district maps mention they actually had completion in seats and even then people elected George Santos. AOC proved you could win a Dem primary but it is grueling and now the DNC will fundraise to hell if you are a progressive. \n\nFixing the party needs to start with a large progressive groundswell to challenge everyone currently in power you already see them running scared from citizens force them to debate and defend themselves and many will crumble.

See the shutdown during Trump's first term, which was the longest consecutive shutdown in US history; the majority of voters blamed Trump, not Democrats, for the shutdown (back then it was specifically the border wall that was described as causing the shutdown; not enough people cared enough about funding a border wall to understand why the GOP had shut down the whole government over it). The result was that eventually Republicans did have to come back to the drawing table and negotiate. Notably Republicans also had control of the House and Senate then, as well.\n\nThere's no guarantee the same would have happened this time, but there's no guarantee it wouldn't have either, not with people already pissed at DOGE and the point of contention for the CR being how much power Congress should give DOGE to continue to decide where to reallocate funds. I'd argue people across the aisle are more pissed at DOGE now than they ever were about a border wall. \n\nAs for why should they care, they don't give a shit about elections and such anymore, etc. etc.: because they still need to drip feed this transition to get the propaganda machine primed and to give people plausible deniability about what's going on, so that they don't understand that something's wrong when the transition actually happens. If they have people rapidly getting pissed before they can do so, then they're going to have a problem on their hands in terms of easily/peacefully shifting the country out of democracy and into something else. So public sentiment absolutely matters (and more specifically, public sentiment of those who voted for Trump or decided either outcome was fine and didn't vote at all).",

Is suggest you set aside your righteous indignation and go do some reading about Andy Beshear. Then tell me what about him you don't like.\n\nHe's the guy who can win, and a candidates only job, is to win. Your Morals and positions don't mean shit if you lose. So you want to lose, again, fine. Run AOC and I'll be right there to do the \"I told you so\" dance",

These same organizations who are actively resisting organized labor, which is not good for the 'working people'.\n\nIt would be nice if he was actively resisting said dismantling of the government, or trying to protect any of the people now being absolutely fucked by the new regime.\n\nAnd yeah, part of the perception of inaction is due to the incredibly robust right-wing media apparatus.

After taking alone time to think about the past few months. Wouldn't you agree that based on all the comments about the present and future of this country that, instead of commenting...maybe it would be beneficial to find solutions to combat the chaos? Talking about it is just that. The most important concern is the divide that we, yes WE have allowed ourselves to become a part of.

We could've had Sanders, but what did we get instead? We got a failed Clinton bid. We got Biden. Then we had Biden refusing to step aside until it was too late, which led into a failed Harris bid. I felt like I was the only person who remembered how massively unpopular Harris was when she tried the first fucking time, but because she's 'not Trump' people thought she would fare better the 2nd time around? Fuck's sake. People are more unenthusiastic about identifying as a democrat now than I have **ever** seen, and we do have ourselves to blame.\n\nParty of working people? Look, it's great that Medicaid exists so people not doing a damn thing can have **literally all medical expenses** paid for, but what about the people making 35k a year? 40k? 45k? Where's assistance for them? Where's assistance for the people who work at homeless shelters, mental health outreach centers, people who actually help folks get this kind of assistance but make too much money to be eligible for anything themselves but not enough money to live comfortably on their own? Democrats haven't been the party of 'working people' in a long fucking time. They're the party of virtue signaling while doing jack shit to help people in lower income brackets.\n\nWe're not losing because the right figured out some magic formula. We're losing because we can't get our shit together. We're losing because people see us as being more focused on gender and identity politics than figuring out why we all have to get raped in taxes when the top percentile of earners in the country hold the vast majority of wealth. We're losing because we've let 'moderates' take the wheel too much and too often and they're so fucking milquetoast that they can't even visualize a better future and are basically lite Republicans. I'm just over it. We need a new party identity and focus. Or, you know, we can just keep doing the same thing and expecting different results because we're on the side of 'right' and 'good,' so SURELY that should be enough.",
