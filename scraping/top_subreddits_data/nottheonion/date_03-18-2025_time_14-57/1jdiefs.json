They accuse the money (or any other item) of being used in a crime, but not the person whose money it is. This allows them to bypass all due process and reasonable suspicion requirements because only people have rights, not objects. If you want it back you then have to go through a lengthy and expensive legal process. So it\u2019s often not worth even trying to get it back.",

Since then law enforcement has found that they can assert that they believe cash they\u2019ve found is the proceeds of a crime and seize it. If the seizure is upheld typically the money goes into the seizing department\u2019s budget so they have an obvious incentive to search for cash. As the owner you do have a right to joint the case and defend your asset but you\u2019ll be paying your own attorney and the seizing agency\u2019s burden of proof is much lower than in a criminal trial. For small to medium seizures it could literally cost you more to prevail than the value of the original seizure.",

The article also notes that while some have speculated a connection to Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative, which aims to remove deceased individuals from government rolls, DOGE has denied any involvement, calling such claims \u201cmaliciously misleading.\u201d There\u2019s no evidence linking Johnson\u2019s case to DOGE; it appears to be an independent administrative error.",
