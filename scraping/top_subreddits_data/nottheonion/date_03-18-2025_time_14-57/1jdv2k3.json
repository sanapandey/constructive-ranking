You have to balance safety with cost, as is traditional in any form of engineering.

And in this case, the cost vs benefit just isn\u2019t worth it.  \n\nYou\u2019d probably prevent an almost imperceptible additional amount of incidents because pilots ARE drug tested after incidents and very, very, very few of them come back positive.

And in many cases, you have to weigh the damage that false positives cause, the failure to even do what you were trying to do with a false negative, and compare that to how much benefit you are actually getting.\n\nThis comes up a LOT in medicine, and is one of the biggest reasons why we don't just give everyone full body scans every year to detect anything negative before you even notice it (Cost being the other one that more people understand).  You need to compare the harm caused by false positives, which can be incredibly emotionally burdensome on patients, and false negatives, which can make outcomes even worse by not detecting a disease that is already present and thus delay treatment, and compare that to the amount of lives improved by the additional testing.  In a lot of cases, even if money wasn't an object, it still doesn't work out to be worth it.  Hence even the ultrawealthy are told to not bother with testing everything under the sun all the time (Well, except by unscrupulous folk, of which there are a lot that run full body scan clinics for the ultrawealthy because they know they can make lots of money regardless of the ethics of it, but that is veering far off topic)",

Others have mentioned different risk profiles for different types of anti-depressants.\n\nThe current main hypothesis seems to be linked to a return in energy allowing them to act out on suicidal thoughts, rather than something specifically chemical, but I suppose the science isn't fully settled yet.\n\nOverall, the risk drops with age, and is limited to a timeframe, so should be completely manageable with pilots. Especially given the higher risk of suicide *without* antidepressants in the long term, not even therapy. More studies would be good, but it seems like a political/bureaucratic/legal issue more than anything stopping a beneficial common-sense policy from getting put in to place. \n\nEven before the pronounced risk was discovered and attempts were made to mitigate it, antidepressants in general at the population level was still giving a positive efficacy rate, even for children, which is why it probably gets glossed over. \n\nJust adding non-anecdotal sources for people interested, as I was after reading your comment.",
