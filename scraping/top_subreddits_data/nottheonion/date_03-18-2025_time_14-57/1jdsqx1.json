Ok, let's pretend it's the first day at the job and you've never been there before. How would you possibly know the average speed? No, what a sane person would do is look it up on their map app, then leave 15 earlier(25 if they want to waste a bunch of money on coffee instead of putting it in a thermos). \n\nLook, math is great for jobs like engineering or accounting. Knowing how to program Excel is fantastic for jobs that need it. Algebra in real life is kind of garbage. And, like I said, proving that you can learn algebra tells people that you can put the time in and aren't a lazy bastard, provided you don't have a learning disability. I'm surprised so many people on Reddit have such lousy reading comprehension and seem to take pleasure in getting irritated for no reason, then try to irritate me by proving they're correct with complete non-realworld applications. \n\n\nShow me the place where I said algebra should not be taught.",

I just love to talk about this, not disagreeing or trying to lecture you specifically.\n\n\nAs an autistic person with health issues I'm not exaggerating when I say that my public school experience heavily contributed to my susceptibility to abuse in/out of and after school. US public schools have functioned as \"conformity camps\" for unpopular, poor, or disabled students long before curriculum started getting altered by alt-rights.\u00a0\n\n\nYou can't fail at drone school if you are attending, because succeeding at drone school is not about comprehending academic curriculum or earning good grades. The point is training compliance and obedience to both covert and overt authority all while asserting the supposed necessity of social conformity. It spans from the relatively appropriate structures (lines, hand raising) to age inappropriate stressors (early standardized testing, poorly monitored bullies), and goes all the way down to inhumanely denying children their right to urinate as needed. \"Your bodily autonomy is second to external authority.\"\u00a0\n\n\nConditioning people into believing that it's more important for them to complete tasks \"for the good of society\" than honor the sensations in their own body and mind has the effect of self-disconnecting on a very base level. We typically don't even treat adult employees this way... Because we don't have to. Many public school educated working adults already put their jobs before their overall livelihood in ways that go far beyond prioritizing financial stability. Often referring to it as a normal and necessary (\"albeit shitty\") part of life.\u00a0\n\n\nSelf-disconnection is incredibly important to controlling masses because it impacts individuals' abilities to create truly authentic and exceptionally functional communities. If systemic dysfunction is sewn into the child's early development experience, it is normalized throughout, then integrated into adolescence and young adulthood. Even the \"best\" relationships developed thereafter will only be able to reach a certain level of healthy function and mutual actualization until the underlying self-disconnection is addressed. So the cycle continues, especially for those who enter the education field themselves or have their own children. This is why self-care and personal development is such an important component of addressing systemic oppression during a time where we are desperately building community.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe organization and climate of public schools in the US is very telling to those familiar with anarchism, child development, and sociological perspectives of history. America's educational system is thoroughly influenced by how industrial oligarchs in particular felt that underpaid child labor was being unfairly ripped from their hands. Similar to the US as a whole, it was built on a bargained compromise, preserving as much benefit to those in power as possible. In this case addressing child welfare \"efficiently:\" Cheap, quick, and one size fits all. An \"education factory,\" or a \"big box school.\" There are more similarities to military or manufacturing than university.\n\n\nThese things can partially explain why our politicians haven't seen it as a pressing problem for children to pass through grade levels or graduate while failing academically. Learning nothing *but* how to conform is an ideal outcome according to our current administration.\u00a0",

Yes, there are some teachers who are on a power trip, but the vast majority of the time, things are the way they are in schools for reasons that have nothing to do with enforcing conformity or beating subordination to authority into kids. \n\n>It spans from the relatively appropriate structures (lines, hand raising) to age inappropriate stressors (early standardized testing, poorly monitored bullies), and goes all the way down to inhumanely denying children their right to urinate as needed. \"Your bodily autonomy is second to external authority.\"\u00a0\n\nLines and hand waving are used, not to enforce conformity, but to reduce chaos. When you have 30 children in your classroom, the only way to keep things from erupting into pure chaos is to make sure they line up and raise their hands. Allowing chaos to reign doesn't help anyone. And the bathroom thing? I've never known a teacher to use the bathroom as a tool of control. The reason *some* kids aren't permitted to go to the bathroom as soon as they ask is because those kids have a history of using the pass to use the restroom as a way of fucking around, of ditching class, avoiding responsibility. If you just let kids go to the bathroom whenever they asked no matter what, you wouldn't have much of a classroom to teach. \n\nThe problem inherent in all of your complaints stems from trying to teach too many kids at once, which is a problem that is extremely difficult to solve without throwing an absolute fuck ton of money at the problem, which probably wouldn't actually solve the problem. The ideal solution would be for parents to teach their own kids what they need to know, but we all know the pitfalls of home schooling and it can and often is worse than any problems that arise from public schools. You can't trust that parents are going to be able to teach their kids what they need to know, and you definitely can't trust that they are fully willing to. This has been a problem that has existed since we started prioritizing education in our society, and it's not an easy one to solve. But pointing at it and reducing it to just society attempting to brain wash and conform all citizens into working drones is not helpful framing.",

I reduced the conversation down to \"drone school\" because that's what the original comment was about. I agree with almost all of your other points.\u00a0\n\n\n1. The issue is not that every teacher is a problem, but that the system is not designed to support students through encounters with unsupportive and dangerous teachers. I also want to reiterate, I don't see the teachers as the problematic enforcers here. They are also victims to this system, often good people who want to help kids but are forced to work within these confines. That said, there are also many wonderful teachers I had that turned blind eye to abuse between other students or from the home whether due to overload or miseducation. I first found this out when I took my own mandated reporter training and discovered that I displayed several risk factors throughout my entire time at school that were not addressed.\n\n\n2. This is why I explicitly labeled those particular things (hands, lines) as \"relatively appropriate.\"\u00a0\n\n\n3. I'm glad you've never had that experience with bathroom control, but my understanding is that it is almost a staple of the school experience, to the point of being integrated into popular media. Maybe that's just more of a real-life issue in my region? Especially with the increase in disciplinary issues associated with social media, bathroom control has increased drastically, which has been a publicized talking point. Obviously disciplinary issues need to be managed but that's a much bigger problem to unpack. The structure of schools should be built to support students to the point where abusing the pass isn't even a problem. Students, whether due to good parenting or proper educational support, shouldn't have any reason or inclination to misuse permissions.\u00a0\n\n\n4. I completely agree about classroom size. This is one of the structures I'm discussing but did not explicitly list. The thinner the teachers are spread, the more individual attention and personalized/accommodating learning fall by the wayside... Which is worth not throwing money at in the eyes of many who vote on these issues getting addressed. That's one of many reasons why IEP supports are on the chopping block. Disabled students who have specific needs are seen as less likely to end up as a benefit to most workforces unless the space is set up to exploit them somehow.\n\n\n5. A big thing we could probably agree on is that parents need to parent. Parents not parenting and using schools to parent their kids makes everything more difficult for teachers who are just trying to do their jobs. The middle ground between homeschooling and public education is not every single parent becoming a full-time, well-rounded teacher. Community-based options would likely become most popular and effective, including ensuring comprehensive curriculum and monitoring for signs of abuse. Plus are going to be more affordable than fixing the public system. Unfortunately it will likely mostly have to come out of the pockets of parents who have the privilege to refuse public education as a resource.\u00a0",

If class is so boring that students are intentionally escaping to the bathroom, there's an issue with curriculum design and classroom engagement. Learning and community integration should theoretically be the most enjoyable things available to kids in schools. Learning should be fun or at the least mentally stimulating. Part of this comes down to children being forced into certain curriculum way before they're able to even develop their own interests around learning, largely due to standardized testing.\n\n\nEven if the curriculum is great and the engagement is high, students are conditioned pretty early to feel like school is a chore or \"duty\" rather than an exciting place to learn and enrich themselves. That partially comes from the structures we're discussing, as well as parenting influences, and now also social media even for some younger kids. As soon as they're able to function relatively independently, most kids are enrolled into the belief set that school is an absolute necessity that has to do with actualizing into an employee... I'd escape to the bathroom, too. Too much pressure, not enough consideration.\u00a0\n\n\nKids learn that the idea of class or school is boring from somewhere. They notice that it's not currently all about the learning when they're not mentally engaged or emotionally supported. It's our responsibility as educators to create an environment that acknowledges childrens' stages of development and integrates that knowledge into how the curriculum is presented and classroom is managed. If the kids are in a stage of rebellion, the structures of their education system should accommodate and maximize that in a way that's productive and healthy, rather than trying to suppress it until it either extinguishes or explodes. Including having wildly different structures per each grade level or even per individual class, if necessary (which would be prohibitively expensive in an institutionalized setting).\u00a0\n\n\nHow many other opportunities are students not only given but actively guided towards and supported in, in or out of school, to appropriately express that kind of \"undesirable\" behavior? For many children, it's almost zero. Of course it will come out in the form of things like exploiting bathroom passes. When afforded the right, it's one of the only opportunities for them to exercise their autonomy from authority during the school day in a way that isn't disallowed or punished.\u00a0",

I'd even be open to more of that in educational settings. But it doesn't have to be enforced covertly via the structure of the school itself. It would be more ethical and effective if it were taught explicitly as a component of the curriculum. Learning this lesson more transparently can also improve their education experience and overall lives.\u00a0 Especially since it's incredibly important for children in particular to understand when they are being expected to do things they don't like to or want to do, and when that is versus isn't logical or acceptable.

We pulled certain graduation required tests and still passed kids if they had maintained grades that showed understanding of the material. This was due to a handful of factors, including the disarray caused by Covid, which caused some kids to fall behind. After Covid passed, they said they noticed that graduation rates DIDNT change to any noticeable degree with the removal of the tests, so they decided not to re-implement them. Ive seen more than a handful of articles since then about how \"we removed the need for kids to know how to read and write or do basic math to graduate high school\", as well as mountains of comments from people (mostly conservatives since they tend to not read into subjects before complaining about them).",

Some people are just horrible test takers. I'm having this discussion with my wife at the moment.\n\nI flew through high-school and have always been a great test taker. Barely even studied (probably a massive detriment to me later on, honestly). My wife struggled with taking math tests, even though she could easily prove that she understood the concepts and could complete assignments without issue, verified by her teachers. We were both students in Florida, for what it's worth. \n\nShe fully agrees with the removal of the standardized tests, while my immediate kneejerk reaction was similar to most of the other comments here. After some discussion, I really do see her point. She's always suffered from test taking anxiety, and would blank out completely when made to take these tests. Then she would show her teacher in class that she did indeed understand all the concepts and could complete the work.",

The article just says it is removing the statewide standardized test requirement, not eliminating the requirement of the courses all together. The courses are still required, they're just doing away with standardized tests. The discussion here would imply most people think otherwise. \n\nI disagree with removing the standardized tests, but I also know I've seen several polls that indicate most people dislike standardized tests, left, right, and center. Many view them as unfair and not indicative of ones academic achievement and there are many educators who dislike the pressure it puts upon them for the aim of just a test. \n\nJohn Oliver did a good piece on standardized testing and the weaknesses of them a few years ago which would imply this isn't a right-side of the aisle idea. \n\nFolks, we probably have agreements on a lot of the politics here, but let's be better and know what we are criticizing after reading a mildly misleading headline. \n\nSure, it says the exam requirements, but the headline knows the words \"exam\" and \"standardized test\" do not hold the same connotation.",

Math problems shouldn\u2019t be paragraphs long. I am all for taking giving the students an Algebra 1 pre-test at the beginning of the year and a post-test at the end. I\u2019m all for accountability, but test them on Algebra 1, and stop with the test being almost all word problems. There\u2019s something wrong with the test when the HS pass rate in the state is consistently around 35%. These politicians making these decisions wouldn\u2019t come close to passing this test, trust me.",
