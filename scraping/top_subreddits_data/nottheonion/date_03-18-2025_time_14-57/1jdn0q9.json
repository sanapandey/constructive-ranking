But for something like oxycodone its about 15-30 for lower tolerance, and a whole 80 for the higher tolerance users. Lethal dose is somewhere between 50-80 or so for zero tolerance but I was doing a handful of 80s a day, 2 at once to start it off, so it varies wildly based on tolerance. Oxy tolerance rises gradually, kind of slowly actually. But fentanyl skyrockets your opiate tolerance quickly, especially if your shooting it. It's so short lived that you need an extra dose a day to stay well (all other opiates are 2 a day, some kind of opiates like buprenorphine, Suboxone prescribed to addicts to get off of opiates, only needs a single dose a day) so your tolerance just goes insane. It's extremely strong but the high isn't nearly as euphoric as even oxy, so people take more and more chasing that bliss. \n\n I'm not going to say heroin is safe because it clearly isn't, but the amount of people I knew that overdosed on it alone (most included benzos like Xanax, a drug just as dangerous but in other ways) was fairly limited, a rare occurrence among long term addicts that knew their limits. Most of them shot their stuff and were fine until they went to sleep and stopped breathing. But once fentanyl hit people dropped left and right, and it was instant, they didn't have hours to go to bed and die then, no it killed them immediately. Dying with the needle still in your arm is a myth, but if you fucked up all you had time to do was put the cap back on it. I had a fuckin heroic tolerance, taking 5 opana 40s, the strongest and best pills ever, every night and I never overdosed (but had horriffic withdrawals) Fentanyl suddenly took over and I overdosed 3 times in like 10 days and saw that as a sign to quit. That was 8-9 years ago and since then every single one of my friends I used with that didn't get clean have died.",

Despite being an addict for a decade over 8 years ago I don't know what strength fentanyl comes in so it's hard to estimate how many recreational doses that would be, hard to look it up since all I get is stuff about addiction help. What I know from the patches is it's like 2mg per whole day. So let's just call 2mg a dose, which you need at least 3x a day to stay well. It's cut/diluted when sold so buying a gram of powder will get you like ~6 doses for a standard addict. So that's like a 1000 grams, and they (used to, probably still do) go for $80-$100 a gram. That's $80,000-$100,000 for the weight of an egg, but what's most important is the volume which is probably a little more than an egg when bricked so use the lower end. So a single eggs worth of fentanyl is twice most people's yearly salary. thats selling to addicts individually though, you might even be able to step on it (cut it) and double that, but that's dangerous selling on the streets. Selling wholesale to a plug (meaning the guy that supplies the street level dealers) would pay about half that but that's still an enormous amount of money for such a small package.",

            "body": "I hate the American government too but the title of the post is a meaningless comparison and frankly click bait. The article states that 5,938 eggs and 1,631 pounds of fentanyl have been seized so far in 2025. The writer said that Newsweek couldn\u2019t make a one to one comparison because of how CBP measures each product. Even if they could say how many pounds of eggs have been seized, that still doesn\u2019t mean anything compared to fentanyl.\u00a0\n\nThe important stat is that the number of eggs seized has grown by 36% between Oct 24 and Feb 25 compared to the same window in the previous year. But we don\u2019t get the same growth stat for fentanyl. I imagine fentanyl seizures grew by less than 36% but since we don\u2019t have the data we can\u2019t make that conclusion. Even if it were true, does it mean less fentanyl is being smuggled or does it mean smugglers are getting better? Both might be true, but then to what extent? And does the increased rate of egg seizures mean around 36% more eggs are being brought to the US border (those both seized and not detected), does it mean CBP is checking for eggs more often than before and the growth rate of illegal egg importation has actually increased by less than 36%?\u00a0\n\nAt the very least I want year-over-year changes in seizures of both eggs and fentanyl, and ideally I want the change in rates of inspections for both products, and a bonus would be a breakdown by each port of entry.",
