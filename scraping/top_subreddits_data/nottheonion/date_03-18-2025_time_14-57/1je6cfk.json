The overwhelming majority of techniques she is normally credited with inventing are actually things that she ripped off from other people, which the Nazi propaganda machine then insisted she'd invented. The Nazis were literally writing propaganda about how great their propaganda was, and apparently the rest of us just *believed* them. \n\nSeriously, it's not even that hard to disprove a lot of the claims about how she was the first to do this or that - there are still surviving films that predate whatever work she supposedly first use a particular technique that use the same technique.",
