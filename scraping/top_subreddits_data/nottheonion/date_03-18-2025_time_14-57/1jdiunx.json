To make money with a much more expensive system, they are targeting taxis, freight movements, etc, where the base cost of the vehicle is a lower consideration.",

There are limitations with what our current technology can handle, in terms of processing power and software, and then there are physical limitations that can never be overcome.\n\nReframing the problem, the question that should be asked is \"what is the best way to detect objects while driving,\" and not \"how do we make a car drive the way a human can.\" Humans are limited to visible light. Our eyes can be fooled. Our brains can learn the difference between a painted wall and a real road, but we can still be tricked. Our eyes are useless in that test where the road is covered in fog. Visible light gets us pretty far, but it is not the optimal way to detect objects on a road. Why limit the car to using only one kind of sensor? The only advantage is cost. The camera only solution is doomed to fail from inception, but it saves money.",

I will only say they should if they don't. I simply don't know and won't make an uneducated guess.\n\n  \nAs for the two failed tests from the Tesla (not the wall one). I addressed both twice, but they were not the focus of the post. So missing them was easy enough.  \n\n1. They are simulated. They are 10x worse than anyone would be experiencing. Having a either fog or rain that thick and not being able to see it would be to dangerous to even drive in let alone use self driving in. Ultimately the tests were too 'perfect' to realistically simulate the rain. Instead they should be using something like the rain fall simulations they use in some movies. While not 100% accurate it is more accurate based on how rainfall actually happens.\n\n2. The water test the LIDAR car struggled with as well. This test showed the system mostly not understanding what was going on and realistically should be run a number of times with an active attempt to understand the success of failure. Which was not the point of the video specifically. \n\n  \nThe two points here are really that the tests were not definitive and more or less for entertainment purposes, which Mark Rober himself came out and said was the case (about them being for entertainment).

                            "body": "A quick search on the subject. Both are not perfect, but I prefer cameras \u2026 but I don\u2019t trust either tech in bad weather, fog, and rain. This is nothing more than a hit piece on Elon and Teslas. Like I said, full EDS. \n\nCameras\nPros:\n\t\u2022\tCost-Effective: Cameras are generally cheaper to produce and install compared to LiDAR systems, making them more accessible for widespread use in vehicles.\n\t\u2022\tColor and Texture Detection: They excel at identifying colors, signs, lane markings, and traffic lights, which are critical for understanding road rules and navigation.\n\t\u2022\tHigh Resolution: Modern cameras provide detailed images, allowing for precise object recognition (e.g., pedestrians, cyclists, or animals) under good lighting conditions.\n\t\u2022\tCompact Size: Cameras are small and easy to integrate into a car\u2019s design without affecting aerodynamics or aesthetics.\n\nCons:\n\t\u2022\tLighting Dependency: Performance drops significantly in low-light conditions, fog, rain, or glare, where visibility is compromised.\n\t\u2022\tDepth Perception Limits: Cameras struggle with accurately measuring distances, especially at high speeds or with fast-moving objects, relying on software to estimate depth.\n\t\u2022\tVulnerability to Obscuration: Dirt, snow, or scratches on the lens can obstruct the view, reducing reliability.\n\t\u2022\tProcessing Intensive: Interpreting camera data requires complex algorithms and significant computational power, which can introduce latency or errors.\n\nLiDAR\nPros:\n\t\u2022\tAccurate Distance Measurement: LiDAR uses laser pulses to create precise 3D maps of the environment, offering superior depth perception and object detection, even at long ranges.\n\t\u2022\tWeather Resilience: It performs well in low-light or dark conditions and is less affected by glare or shadows, though heavy rain or snow can still scatter laser beams.\n\t\u2022\t360-Degree Awareness: LiDAR can scan in all directions, providing a comprehensive view of the surroundings, which is ideal for detecting obstacles in complex scenarios.\n\t\u2022\tReliability: Less dependent on external lighting or color, making it consistent across various conditions.\n\nCons:\n\t\u2022\tHigh Cost: LiDAR systems are expensive to manufacture and integrate, which can drive up vehicle prices and limit adoption in mass-market cars.\n\t\u2022\tSize and Aesthetics: Traditional LiDAR units are bulky and can be challenging to blend into a car\u2019s design, though newer solid-state versions are more compact.\n\t\u2022\tLimited Texture Recognition: LiDAR doesn\u2019t capture color or fine details like text on signs, requiring pairing with other sensors (e.g., cameras) for full functionality.\n\t\u2022\tWeather Sensitivity: While better than cameras in some conditions, heavy precipitation or fog can still degrade its performance by scattering laser beams.\n\nSummary\nCameras are affordable and great for visual interpretation but falter in poor conditions and depth accuracy. LiDAR offers precision and reliability in diverse scenarios but comes with a higher cost and integration challenges. In practice, many advanced safety systems (like those in autonomous vehicles) combine both to leverage their strengths\u2014cameras for visual context and LiDAR for spatial accuracy. The choice depends on the specific safety goals, budget, and driving environment.",

They put one there because it improves the car's self-driving functionality - it's just the best place for one. Tesla would also be improved by having a roof camera, but that would make the car look a lot worse and people wouldn't want to buy it. As it stands, they chose aesthetics over functionality and they've paid the price. \n\n>Businesses make decisions, sometimes you have to believe in what you believe, and push on.

You are welcome to buy a lidar car, your $, I\u2019ll buy cameras, my $.\n\nI don't really care whether his FSD stack is camera-only or not. Only whether the product is safe. I don't think it is right now. I don't think it will ever be as safe as a lidar/camera combo. Even then, it's largely a tolerable situation as long as drivers need to be behind the wheel. If Tesla truly does attempt a driverless FSD taxi service in June as promised (and I doubt this meet this timeline), I would be very concerned about the safety of other people on the road. \n\n>All you\u2019re trying to do is shit on Elon, and Tesla.

They've been the most forward-facing of companies developing autonomous driving, but they've never been on the bleeding edge. Don't confuse publicity with progress.",
