And on top of that were the demands in the community, the things in which one had to, was \u2018expected to\u2019 participate that had not been there or had not been important before. It was all rigmarole, of course, but it consumed all one\u2019s energies, coming on top of the work one really wanted to do. You can see how easy it was, then, not to think about fundamental things.

Nazism gave us some dreadful, fundamental things to think about\u2014we were decent people\u2014and kept us so busy with continuous changes and \u2018crises\u2019 and so fascinated, yes, fascinated, by the machinations of the \u2018national enemies,\u2019 without and within, that we had no time to think about these dreadful things that were growing, little by little, all around us. Unconsciously, I suppose, we were grateful. Who wants to think?\n>\n>\"To live in this process is absolutely not to be able to notice it\u2014please try to believe me\u2014unless one has a much greater degree of political awareness, acuity, than most of us had ever had occasion to develop. Each step was so small, so inconsequential, so well explained or, on occasion, \u2018regretted,\u2019 that, unless one were detached from the whole process from the beginning, unless one understood what the whole thing was in principle, what all these \u2018little measures\u2019 that no \u2018patriotic German\u2019 could resent must some day lead to, one no more saw it developing from day to day than a farmer in his field sees the corn growing. One day it is over his head.\n>\n>\"How is this to be avoided, among ordinary men, even highly educated ordinary men? Frankly, I do not know. I do not see, even now. Many, many times since it all happened I have pondered that pair of great maxims, Principiis obsta and Finem respice\u2014\u2018Resist the beginnings\u2019 and \u2018Consider the end.\u2019 But one must foresee the end in order to resist, or even see, the beginnings. One must foresee the end clearly and certainly and how is this to be done, by ordinary men or even by extraordinary men? Things might have. And everyone counts on that might.\n>\n>\"Your \u2018little men,\u2019 your Nazi friends, were not against National Socialism in principle. Men like me, who were, are the greater offenders, not because we knew better (that would be too much to say) but because we sensed better. Pastor Niem\u00f6ller spoke for the thousands and thousands of men like me when he spoke (too modestly of himself) and said that, when the Nazis attacked the Communists, he was a little uneasy, but, after all, he was not a Communist, and so he did nothing; and then they attacked the Socialists, and he was a little uneasier, but, still, he was not a Socialist, and he did nothing; and then the schools, the press, the Jews, and so on, and he was always uneasier, but still he did nothing. And then they attacked the Church, and he was a Churchman, and he did something\u2014but then it was too late.\"\n>\n>\"Yes,\" I said.\n>\n>\"You see,\" my colleague went on, \"one doesn\u2019t see exactly where or how to move. Believe me, this is true. Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don\u2019t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don\u2019t want to \u2018go out of your way to make trouble.\u2019 Why not?\u2014Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.\n>\n>\"Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, \u2018everyone\u2019 is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, \u2018It\u2019s not so bad\u2019 or \u2018You\u2019re seeing things\u2019 or \u2018You\u2019re an alarmist.\u2019\n>\n>\"And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can\u2019t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don\u2019t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.\n>\n>\"But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in little organizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to\u2014to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.\n>\n>\"But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That\u2019s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked\u2014if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in \u201943 had come immediately after the \u2018German Firm\u2019 stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in \u201933. But of course this isn\u2019t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\n>\n>\"And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying \u2018Jewish swine,\u2019 collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in\u2014your nation, your people\u2014is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.\n>\n>\"You have gone almost all the way yourself. Life is a continuing process, a flow, not a succession of acts and events at all. It has flowed to a new level, carrying you with it, without any effort on your part. On this new level you live, you have been living more comfortably every day, with new morals, new principles. You have accepted things you would not have accepted five years ago, a year ago, things that your father, even in Germany, could not have imagined.\n>\n>\"Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven\u2019t done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early meetings of your department in the university when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood. A small matter, a matter of hiring this man or that, and you hired this one rather than that. You remember everything now, and your heart breaks. Too late. You are compromised beyond repair.\n>\n>\"What then? You must then shoot yourself. A few did. Or \u2018adjust\u2019 your principles. Many tried, and some, I suppose, succeeded; not I, however. Or learn to live the rest of your life with your shame. This last is the nearest there is, under the circumstances, to heroism: shame. Many Germans became this poor kind of hero, many more, I think, than the world knows or cares to know.\"",

For many Italians and Germans it felt totally normal.  Even after Italy went back for round 2 with Ethiopia and Germany invaded Poland.  I'd imagine, for many Germans, it was not untill the first British bombs landed in Berlin that shit got real.  I'm not sure exactly when the majority of the population began to really suffer.  I do know that they cheered for total war in Feb of 1943.  They held a rally literally fucking celebrating total war.  This was long after the writing was on the wall since their dumbass ally pulled America into the conflict and the USSR had halready yanked their vicious asses out of Stalingrad and halted the Wehrmacht advance.  I do know, on the Eastern Front, many soldiers quietly discussed being abandoned by Hitler, particularly in the Sixth Army.  The regular folks back home though?  The majority were still very much supportive of the clusterfuck they'd voted themselves into.",

This is a position I agree with.  As I am watching the video, they slam Chuck Schumer (rightfully so) and they play his response as why he is voting for the CR, calling his response \"word salad\".  They play a 15 second clip and move on.  \n\nThe thing is, I also watch a lot of C-SPAN.  A few hours before, I watched Mr. Schumer's explanation on why he is voting yes.  It was not word salad, it was carefully created and explained many issues with a shutdown like losing the fight in the courts due to their funding running out an a few weeks after the shutdown.  He said the courts are the best fighting chance the Democrats have right now and the shutdown would allow Trump to stop the legislation against him.  \n\nNow this isn't about if the Democrats made the right call.  It's not about Midas Touch purposefully not showing his response, explaining it themselves and painting him as a fool with no real reasons for doing what he did.  What I am saying is that misinformation is literally everywhere all the time.  We just all need to be careful parroting what we see from the news.

There is a thought terminating cliche to get them to close their eyes and ears to anything negative about Trump.     \n       \nAny news bad about Trump is \"fake news.\"  Anybody who criticizes Trump as \"trump derangement syndrome.\"  Any legal troubles Trump has are \"lawfare\" and \"weaponization of government\" (keep in mind this is the guy who practically ran on \"lock her up!\" in 2016).  He would even dismiss negative opinions of him by saying that the person was a \"never trumper\" or a \"trump hater\"... because apparently somehow \"well their opinion doesn't count, they don't support me!\" is in any way a legitimate defense???",

Republicans like to adopt accusations of what they're doing (the projection everyone talks about) as a method to diffuse criticism before it can take root.\n\nFor example, Trump likes to complain about \"fake news\" even though he's probably the most prolific source of it.\n\nIt helps them because if you or I complain about fake news, MAGA people can be like, \"Yeah, you're just complaining us for the same reasons we already complain about you.\"  It makes things look symmetrical, and then it just seems like squabbling where neither side is necessarily \"correct\", and you get to just pick a side.\n\nThey do this with a lot of things.  They accuse everyone of being a pedophile when Trump has actually had legitimate accusations of raping people, including at least one child.  They claim disliking Trump's policies means you're deranged, when they actually worship him as a bizarre religious figure.\n\nIt's part of the whole \"flood the zone with shit\" strategy, which is actually adapted from Putin's \"firehose of falsehood\" strategy.",

We should always be extremely critical of the government no matter which party is in power and the second we start some authoritarian system to classify citizens who speak out against the government is when we are done as a democratic republic( although one could argue that's already gone) forever.\n Don't be so quick to hand your rights over for \"safety\". Instead, pretend your right to speak out against the government is a gun because once your voice is gone and the right to organize a protest is gone, the gun will be the only thing left to make a difference.",

We also have to give the mentally ill due process. *What we\u2019re going to do is take the guns when they\u2019re taken into custody or into the hospital* and then, when they\u2019re released in 24 hours or 72 hours, *to determine whether they should give those guns back.*\n\nI was dumbfounded that they were talking this openly about taking people\u2019s guns and then letting the government dictate whether or not they\u2019re returned to the owners. But this new push makes sense now. \n\nFind some bullshit doctor to formally \u201cdiagnose\u201d a person with TDS. Lock that person up involuntarily, take their guns, and then decide \u201cnah they\u2019re still a danger to themselves so we\u2019re keeping their guns.\u201d\n\nSo it seems the plan is to identify dissidents, diagnose them with a mental illness, have them involuntarily committed; thus allowing the confiscation of their firearms. And when the person gets out the government just\u2026 doesn\u2019t give them back. \n\nAnd yet we won\u2019t hear a **peep** from the \u201cdon\u2019t take my guns\u201d crowd.",

Absolutely nobody in USA can recall  Peter Pomerantsev's 2014 book on the subject. Everyone has lost their minds to TDS (all 5,000 plus patterns of TDS) and it isn't just voters, even those too young to legally vote, and even people outside the nation. Surkov students wrecked the USA and nobody can defend, they just flounder in meme-speak in insults and sound all like Elon Musk on Twitter. It's monstrous how horrific things have become :( Hearts and minds have been scalped so badly :(\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*At the NATO summit in Wales last week, General Philip Breedlove, the military alliance\u2019s top commander, made a bold declaration. Russia, he said, is waging \u201cthe most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare.\u201d It was something of an underestimation. The new Russia doesn\u2019t just deal in the petty disinformation, forgeries, lies, leaks, and cyber-sabotage usually associated with information warfare. It reinvents reality, creating mass hallucinations that then translate into political action.* - 2014",

Absolute authoritarianism without meaningful accountability.\n2. No tolerance for questions or critical inquiry.\n3. No meaningful financial disclosure regarding budget, expenses such as an independently audited financial statement.\n4. Unreasonable fear about the outside world, such as impending catastrophe, evil conspiracies and persecutions.\n5. There is no legitimate reason to leave, former followers are always wrong in leaving, negative or even evil.\n6. Former members often relate the same stories of abuse and reflect a similar pattern of grievances.\n7. There are records, books, news articles, or television programs that document the abuses of the group/leader.\n8. Followers feel they can never be \u201cgood enough\u201d.\n9. The group/leader is always right.\n10. The group/leader is the exclusive means of knowing \u201ctruth\u201d or receiving validation, no other process of discovery is really acceptable or credible.\n\nTen warning signs regarding people involved in/with a potentially unsafe group/leader.\n\n1. Extreme obsessiveness regarding the group/leader resulting in the exclusion of almost every practical consideration.\n2. Individual identity, the group, the leader and/or God as distinct and separate categories of existence become increasingly blurred. Instead, in the follower\u2019s mind these identities become substantially and increasingly fused\u2014as that person\u2019s involvement with the group/leader continues and deepens.\n3. Whenever the group/leader is criticized or questioned it is characterized as \u201cpersecution\u201d.\n4. Uncharacteristically stilted and seemingly programmed conversation and mannerisms, cloning of the group/leader in personal behavior.\n5. Dependency upon the group/leader for problem solving, solutions, and definitions without meaningful reflective thought. A seeming inability to think independently or analyze situations without group/leader involvement.\n6. Hyperactivity centered on the group/leader agenda, which seems to supercede any personal goals or individual interests.\n7. A dramatic loss of spontaneity and sense of humor.\n8. Increasing isolation from family and old friends unless they demonstrate an interest in the group/leader.\n9. Anything the group/leader does can be justified no matter how harsh or harmful.\n10. Former followers are at best-considered negative or worse evil and under bad influences. They can not be trusted and personal contact is avoided. \n\n[Cult Education website](https://culteducation.com/warningsigns.html)",

How dare they!\n\nNothing you listed is far-left. The conservative left also wants all of those things.\n\nHell, the highest taxes on the rich and business in the past century were during Clinton's Presidency and he was the poster boy for the moderate wing of the Democratic party. The only one right of Clinton within the movers and shakers of the party was his wife, and his wife was the one who first thought to re-formulate the Right's health care proposal into what would eventually become Obamacare.\n\nThe far left are the DSA, the CPUSA, etc. Bernie Sanders is one of the most moderate influences among the far-left.\n\nThat being said, while I don't share much common ground with the far-left, I at least respect most of their motivations. I cannot say the same for the far-right.\n\nI just want a non-FPTP voting system in the US, so we can have a sane mix of parties, not this broken two-party abomination where the Democrats have to keep watering down their message to find the largest voter base while the Republicans keep driving their entire base further and further into the horrifying fringes of the far-right.",

It feels like you are taking crazy pills, because you are out of touch with the entire information stream those people have. You basically live in a different reality. To them, your information stream looks as out of touch as Fox News and Joe Rogan seem to you. It doesn't really matter who's right and who's wrong.

All the stuff in your first paragraph is projection used to distract as they engage in culture wars so you don\u2019t call them out for destroying the economy, our social safety net, and civil rights. \n\nDemocrats have recovered the economy from total disasters that occurred under the two previous Republican administrations. Democrats have worked to expand protection for workers, access to healthcare, education, etc. Republicans accuse democrats, without any evidence, of causing said disasters. \n\nAnyone who can look at the MAGA cult and sincerely believe they\u2019re the stable ones is not playing with a full deck. The MAGA movement is very much a cult. I wish I had saved the link to the study where they looked at how blindly Trump supporters follow him. The result of the study was that Trump supporters had a stronger tendency to support Don the con no matter how hypocritical, inflammatory, and contradictory his statements. Dems were more likely to be critical of their own party leaders when they were objectively wrong. \n\nThe same poll that shows a 47% approval rating also shows that the majority of registered voters (51%) disapprove of his performance as president. I assume you\u2019re talking about the NBC News poll. There are several others that have his approval rating as low as 39%. No matter what poll you look at, Trump has a larger percentage of people who disapprove of him than approve. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to convert anyone to win as a democrat. You need to turn out voters. Bigger turnout will favor Dems. That\u2019s why republicans are so hell bent on making voting more accessible. They know they\u2019ll lose, especially on policy, if all eligible voters show up. \n\nThere is only one reality. Despite the best efforts of Trump and his minions to promote their \u201calternative facts\u201d, they are not living in the real world. To pretend that their propaganda has any validity is to help their devolution toward idiocracy. \n\nI will go back to projection. All of this TDS is projection. Are democrats really unhinged? They\u2019re upset and see how he is hurting all of us. The real unhinged behavior is coming from MAGA. These people are loud, stupid, violent, and somehow believe they are serving a leader that god sent to save us.
