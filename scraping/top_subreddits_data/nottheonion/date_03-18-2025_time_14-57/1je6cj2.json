Travellers are pissed. If hotels can just cancel bookings when prices go up, what\u2019s the point of locking in a deal? Has anyone else had this happen?",

Still in-state, from one corner of the state to the other basically. I got to the rental place to pick up a full-size.\n\nFirst customer of the day was already waiting. They spent a half hour trying to harass the lone service agent into renting the new red Dodge Charger they\u2019d reserved. They had an out of state expired ID, a credit card belonging to a town government in a third state, and insurance under a similar (but not the same) name. The agent wasn\u2019t going for it and they finally walked away.\n\nI\u2019m sure the agent expected me to be upset at the wait, but as far as I\u2019m concerned I just got a free show.\n\nThe agent gave me the Charger.\n\nIt was awesome to drive, very powerful, and something I don\u2019t care to drive again. The temptation to open it up on the roads is huge. I never exceeded the speed limit with it, too much of a cop magnet. But wow is that a fun car.",
