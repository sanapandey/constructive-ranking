The fact that the British were so active in those theatres throughout the war was the very reason why those invasions were even possible...\n\nAnd lets not forget that it was American isolationism that allowed Germany to take France in the first place - they did nothing while Germany ranged across Europe, and it wasnt until Germany declared war on America that America actually entered the European theatre.",
