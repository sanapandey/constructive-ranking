    "selftext": "Welcome to our Wednesday TF2 weapon discussion. Here, we'll discuss weapons (and reskins, if applicable) from TF2!\n\nToday's weapon is The Gunboats.\n\nWeapon Stats:\n- -60% blast damage from rocket jumps\n\nThe Gunboats were first introduced in the WAR! update. Interestingly enough, the in-game files mention `c_rocketboots_demo` due to the WAR! update being a competition between the Soldier and Demoman. Soldier received The Gunboats by winning the competition and killing more Demomen.\n\nGunboats are widely used to [Rocket Jump](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Jumping#Soldier_jumps) as the Soldier to cross map distances very fast. Due to Rocket Jumping inflicting damage on the Soldier, The Gunboats are a great asset in reducing said damage and making sure his health doesn't drop during the traversal and before any potential firefights.\n\nFeel free to discuss the weapon here. Anything that you like/dislike, cool tips or strategies, interesting stories, etc. If you feel the weapon is not to your liking, feel free to express your opinions in a respectful manner.\n\nFor those who wish to learn more about the weapon, you can find the wiki page here:\n\n[The Gunboats, from the TF2 Wiki](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Gunboats).\n\nYou can find previous weapon discussions in a nice overview [here](/r/tf2/wiki/weapon-discussion-archive).",

Which is actually a really good thing because med really lacks agency and it\u2019s a big reason why he\u2019s so unpopular. There\u2019s also the additional upside of improving gameflow for other classes since they don\u2019t have to stand idle doing nothing for 10 seconds every time they take damage in order to build crit heals (or even worse spend 30 seconds scouring the map for health packs or just dying and looking at the respawn screen).\n\nLike if the crossbow got deleted overnight I would frame 1 drop this game, both as a medic player and as a general player as well.",

                            "body": "The truth is somewhere inbetween both your opinions, Crossbow definitely makes Medic more fun/skilled to play... but it's also undeniably a buff in effectiveness to a class that is already mandatory to win.\n\nOn top of that, the amount of additional healing it pumps in is bad for the game in ways that become more noticeable at smaller playercounts:\n\n>There\u2019s also the additional upside of improving gameflow for other classes since they don\u2019t have to stand idle doing nothing for 10 seconds every time they take damage in order to build crit heals (or even worse spend 30 seconds scouring the map for health packs or just dying and looking at the respawn screen)\n\nDeath should not be considered a bad thing in an FPS. Sure, as a Medic main you want to keep people alive. But if nobody ever dies, the game never progresses, and the more skilled team doesn't get their reward.\n\nAs a result, healing *hurts* gameflow rather than helping it. Let's say both teams are at a stalemate waiting for Uber. Without Crossbow, if I deal 150 damage to a Soldier because I'm a better player, he has to either back up and go find healing, or die. Either of those options gives ground to my team, progressing the game, which is good for game flow.\n\nWith Crossbow, his Medic can wipe out that 150 I just did from the other side of the room if he just stands still for an instant behind cover. Now it's as if the last 30 seconds of fighting didn't exist, and my skill was made totally irrelevant, and neither of us got any closer to winning. By removing a pushable advantage, the stalemate was prolonged. That's *bad* for game flow.\n\nI would absolutely not remove Crossbow but I would change it to heal a more sensible amount, like a range of 50-100. To compensate for that, I'd buff the Syringe Guns a little to function more similarly to the Crossbow, so Medic has more choice in the slot.",

            "body": "Ah, the eternal Banners versus Booties versus Shooties debate\u2026.\n\nTLDR: Gunboats really *are* the truth.\n\nI\u2019m a trained Roaming Soldier and practiced Jumper, I LOVE the mobility afforded by only taking 20 damage from a rocket jump that Gunboats gives. A minimum of 40 damage from a normal jump no boots makes you a lot less mobile as a Soldier and to me Booties is like taking the weights off.\n\nAll of the Banners are good but Battalions in my opinion is the best: you have the most HP, you can use the resistance to jump away while banner is ending, and not being able to die from headshots is so impactful as a Combo Class (keeping your Medic and other teammates from being headshot is super important too). Soldier does a lot of damage already and has the mobility and heals while playing Combo to make it out of almost any engagement, but Battalions is the only thing in the game that lets Soldier be a real defensive force in addition to offensive.\n\nShooties are the Classic \u201cget away from my Medic\u201d weapon. Deathmatch Soldiers take the Stock Shotty and turn it into a dangerous midrange denial tool. There isn\u2019t a lot to say about it, when you aren\u2019t going to be jumping around the map and are gluing yourself to your Medic, there isn\u2019t much better backup than Shotgun.\n\nGunboats falls into all this by giving Soldier his wings. Fully buffed and with the best mobility tool at his disposal, Soldier IS like an eagle: he flies in, gets the kill, and escapes into the wind. Two rockets are more than enough to kill almost any target short of a Heavy, but with the support of his teammates Roaming Soldier is one of the game\u2019s most impactful chase and cleanup classes. Roaming Soldiers are also superb at drawing attention and making space, since a bombing Soldier is not only loud and attention-getting but also extremely threatening. Because the Gunboats let Soldier jump more freely, Roamers can execute complicated and technical rollouts to go for incredibly difficult to predict and avoid dive-bombs and can make it to the battlefield incredibly fast to take ground for the team to move in. Speed and skill in jumping make Gunboats Soldiers shine, and being able to fluidly move back and forth from the flank to the Combo when needed is what makes Gunboats such a strong and impactful tool.",

The grenade launcher is a great option and sticky jumping, while powerful, is more limited in some ways compared to rocket jumping. Or it'd turn demo into a hyper-mobile sticky spamming nightmare, one or the other lol",

That extra 100HP makes you extremely resilient to Scouts, Soldiers, Pyros (especially,) Demos, Sentries, other Heavies, and Medics (ofc). Snipers are your dedicated counter, which you get in exchange for countering Pyro very effectively. Heavy is one of the most effective Spychecking classes as he can spray a large area with bullets. \n\nRandom crits, aside from not being that common, are actually an argument FOR why +100HP is so important; for example a crit rocket deals 270 damage, enough to oneshot any class *except* Heavy. Crit stickies are usually between 200 and 300 unless you're right on top of them. Grenades are the only thing that makes 300hp irrelevant. But all the other random crits are in low enough damage ranges that they won't kill Heavy, but having more health after taking the crit absolutely helps.",
