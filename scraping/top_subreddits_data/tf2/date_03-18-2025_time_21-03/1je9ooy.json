So basically it\u2019s an official tf2 neca plushie and since there\u2019s very few tf2 merch that was ever made and sold and they were all given out around the mid 2000\u2019s and 2010\u2019s so you can only find them on eBay for HUNDREDS or thousands of dollars. Meaning 120 with shipping compared to 600 without shipping is a big difference yk? :3",
