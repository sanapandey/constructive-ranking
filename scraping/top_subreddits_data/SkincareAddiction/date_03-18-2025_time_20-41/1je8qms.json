    "selftext": "Just a PSA. \n\nSkinvive is a trendy new product in the US. Some people yield great results. In more cases than seem to be reported, faces are left bumpy as all heck.\n\nI had it done in October, and was promised glowing hydrated skin. I\u2019ve had chronic eczema my whole life and to me this sounded amazing.\n\nI had about 50 injections and each one left what looked like a mosquito bite. Split on each of my cheeks. I was told they would last maybe a week.\n\nIt\u2019s now March, and the bumps persist. Over the last few months, I have had the bumps injected with hylenex (an enzyme to dissolve the hyaluronic acid in the skinvive). It did nothing. We did 10 rounds of injections with no improvement.\n\nFinally, in February, we ultimately decided to do steroid injections. The wonderful news is that it got rid of the bumps. Or most of them.\n\nThe bad news is that I now have massive craters in my face from the steroids, which caused atrophy. I have one in particular that is a line about an inch long. But there are several.\n\nI have been asked countless times what happened to my face. I\u2019m beyond devastated and have been in a very dark place since this happened. It has caused me so much stress. I\u2019ve been in a dark depression, lost lots of weight, and had to up all of anxiety medication.\n\nDo yourself a favor and STAY AWAY FROM SKINVIVE. \n\nI\u2019ve lost all hope that my face will return to normal. :(",
