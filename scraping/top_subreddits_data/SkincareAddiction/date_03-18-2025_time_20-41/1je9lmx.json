    "selftext": "\nSo I\u2019ve struggled with body acne sense I was a teenager, I\u2019m 32 now and it\u2019s still an issue. I haven\u2019t always been on top of it because I\u2019ve never had anything work for me, a lot of things seem to make it worse. Right now I\u2019m actually trying to be responsible about it and work towards finally clearing it up but I need advice. A lot of acne information is for breakouts on the face and it\u2019s just kind of a different ball game in my opinion. I switched to fragrance free laundry detergent and I started using cetaphil bar soap which seems to calm my skin down compared to everything else I\u2019ve tried. I\u2019ve tried panoxyl in the past but it seemed to make it worse. I recently decided to try it again but switched to the 4% rather than the 10%. I\u2019m only about two weeks in so I don\u2019t expect change yet but it does seem to be easier on my skin using it only once a day. I was thinking about using salicylic in the morning and using the panoxyl at night but I\u2019m worried it might be too much for my skin and make it worse. I also need advice on a moisturizer to use after I shower. I\u2019ve tried a few different ones but it seems to make my skin more irritated whenever I try and moisturize. In the pictures you can see the irritation on my neck that happened after using a moisturizer before bed. My neck has been pretty clear lately but after using a moisturizer last night it\u2019s kind of angry. I\u2019ve been trying to eat better and avoid sugars and stuff like that and it seems to help in certain areas but my skin around my shoulders and chest are still pretty angry. ",

Benzoyl peroxide comes in 10% strength over the counter, though.\u00a0\n\nThe salicylic acid will help with skin/cell turnover and clogged pores. The benzoyl peroxide kills bacteria. This combo helps most people. You\u2019ll need to see a derm for something prescription strength or antibiotics (oral or topical) or even more extreme treatments if necessary.\u00a0\n\nGood luck!",

You don\u2019t want to stress your skin too much or else it could make things worse or cause new issues. Benzoyl peroxide tends to be a little more drying so if you feel like your skin is already dry I would go with salicylic. Especially since it tends to come in lower concentrations than the benzoyl peroxide. And always moisturize after using either product. Salicylic can also be drying but it\u2019s not as bad.",

My body really liked redken all soft shampoo and condition. Now I\u2019m using the green Keretasse shampoo. \n\n\u2022Changed body wash\ud83e\udee7\n\n~the body shop tea tree body wash is great. I tried tea tree before and thought this was going to be a fail but it\u2019s great. It\u2019s from the Uk tho and takes forever from Amazon \n\n\u2022Started working on restoring my skin barrier \ud83e\udee7\n\n~this meant more moisture products and less drying products on my back \n\n~there\u2019s a colloidal oatmeal lotion from Etsy that absolutely took me to the next level of healing, praise Jesus, and I\u2019m so good rn that I can let conditioner roll down my back and it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s actually all I use rn on my back.\n\n~Adapalene cream for any persisting big acne, got mine from target \n \n\n\u2022used a new towel after every shower \ud83e\udee7\n( Ik this is psycho but my skin barrier was so messed up )\n\n\u2022changed bed sheets and pillows every month \ud83e\udee7\n\n\nAnd weirdly idk how to explain it but you\u2019ll get a point where ur getting 2-3 pimples a month and weirdly you\u2019ll have to kind of start extracting old black heads. It\u2019s like they were laying dormant until there was space to come out too. And after that final stage, ur basically free forever. I had only  like 3 pimples for the WHOLE year last year. I did need help with extracting the pimples when it got to that 2-3 a month cadence, cause mine were in hard to reach parts of my back so I would get them extracted every so often by a lady. \n\nAnd she would also occasional put acid on just my shoulders which was my ultra trouble spot ( so was the small of my back but that cleared up before that ) \n\nPrayers for your quick recovery and journey to freedom. It\u2019s possible \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc and be encouraged bc you look good. The acne doesn\u2019t take away from your value one bit",

If gentle cetaphil bar soap is calming the skin, then maybe you're just over producing oil and it's clogging pores.  Try washing with kojic acid soap. It's a mild acid from fermented rice. It will lighten dark pigmentation, kills acne, clears out oils but maybe too much depending on your skin. Maybe try every other day or rinse well. You can lather and spot treat acne by letting it sit overnight. If you moisturize avoid anything that has oil. Read the labels carefully. Diet and exercise are also very important. Throw in some daily pushups and situps. You look like you should try some yoga or pilates. Good luck",
