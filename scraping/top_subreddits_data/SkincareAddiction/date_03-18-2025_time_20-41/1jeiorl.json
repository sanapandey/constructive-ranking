    "selftext": "I finally found my holy grail Vit C serum. It is the Vitamin C Super serum by Protocol Labs. I\u2019ve tried sooo many vit c serums that either didn\u2019t work for my hyperpigmentation or were so sticky/smelled bad that I hated wearing it and most of the time would break me out. For the first time in weeks I\u2019ve had not one single breakout and noticed visible brightness within days. My old scars from previous extractions are barely noticeable now. Cool thing is it is bottled in a 100% oxygen-free and light-free environment using patented aerospace containment technology. The packaging is incredible it\u2019s designed so that one pump is exactly how much you need I\u2019ve never seen anything like it!! I recently got their water lock moisturizer and absolutely loveee it I finally found a brand that works for me \ud83d\ude2d\n\n",
