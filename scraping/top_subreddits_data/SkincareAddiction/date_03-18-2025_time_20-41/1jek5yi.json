    "selftext": "Hey y\u2019all, pretty much what the title says. I grew out my bush for awhile but i recently clipped the hair short with my electric razor. I have 3-4 hard bumps on each side which I assume are ingrown hairs? But I haven\u2019t shaved completely bare in years so I\u2019m not sure how they could have happened? Is there something else this could be? How can I get rid of them? Please help!\n\nI also tried squeezing them but it wouldn\u2019t work, usually when I have ingrowns I can get them out this way and then they heal. This is why I\u2019m thinking it could be something else ",
