I'm also worried about the little black dots (i don't know if those are pores or blackheads) all over my nose. and just for the record i'd love to know if you think i've got dry skin or not since that's what i've always based my skincare routine off of (i think it is dry but i'm not sure if it's dry, combo or sensitive).\u00a0\n\nthanks a lot for reading and taking your time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4nn671qdgpe1.jpeg?width=1516&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88cc7d8242869210a62cf941b1a791641f7f90be",

(I'm not even sure if my angular cheilitis was an actual fungal infection. I was taking precautionary measures).\n\nMy angular cheilitis cleared up, but last week, the area AROUND the left corner of my mouth suddenly flared up (see pic). It doesn't itch, but I am concerned the inflammation will spread (I have dry skin and am prone to eczema).\n\nI am confused about how to treat this because the inflamed area SURROUNDS where my angular cheilitis was (see pics). My theory is that the area (which is often exposed to toothpaste when I brush my teeth) became super sensitive and dry back when I was actively treating my angular cheilitis (esp because I was frequently washing it and not moisturizing it because I was afraid moisture would feed the fungus). And this same area was irritated by my toothpaste (I should have been more careful). OR, is it a fungal infection?\n\nAnother strange thing about this inflammation is that at random points of the day, the inflammation will considerably clear up for a few hours. But if eat something/wake up the next morning, it's this pink color again. It is also a bit flaky.\n\nMy current skin routine is I only use Eczema Foundation approved cleansers and moisturizers. For moisturizing, I use cerave moisturizing cream and and avene's xeracalm (occlusive).\n\nI'm going to monitor this for about a week before I seek out a dermatologist. My question in the meantime is -- has this ever happened to anyone? Or, how would you go about treating this? I've been afraid to put vaseline/occlusives on it just in case it might be a fungal infection. Do you think I should let it dry? I tried putting anti fungal on it for one night. It didn't really seem to help.\n\nThank you!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2xdc4qdnlhpe1.jpeg?width=1110&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76fe4191c6c7f6ea3925a0c1bfd5e60ed536e683",

You might have to stay at every other day which is fine and also effective. \n\nAzelaic acid and vitamin c are not recommended to layer either.

            "body": "Hey all,\n\n30M here.\n\nI'm planning to start using retinol, and I've been researching about that in this sub as well as some others.\n\nI've shortlisted these brands, Neutrogena, Olay and Ordinary.\n\nI'm leaning towards Neutrogena.\n\nBut I'm confused with these Neutrogena products:\n\n1. [Neutrogena Visible Repair Retinol + Peptide Anti-Ageing Day & Night Cream For Wrinkles & Fine Lines](https://www.nykaa.com/neutrogena-visible-repair-regenerating-cream/p/16467663?ptype=product&skuId=16467663)\n2. [Neutrogena Visible Repair Serum](https://www.nykaa.com/neutrogena-visbile-repair-serum/p/16467662?ptype=product&skuId=16467662)\n3. [Should i also include this eye cream](https://www.nykaa.com/neutrogena-visible-repair-complete-care-combo/p/18911953?productId=18911953&pps=10) - a Nykaa post suggests to use the all three, is it just marketing?\n\nIs just Neutrogena Visible Repear Cream enough?\n\nI'm a complete beginner in skin routine. I currently use Cetaphil cleanser, and Nivea moisturizer. Should i also include milk toner in the routine?\n\nIf you've better suggestions, please let me know.\n\nThanks",
