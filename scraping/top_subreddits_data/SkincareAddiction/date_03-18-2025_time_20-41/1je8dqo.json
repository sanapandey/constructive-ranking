    "selftext": "Hi! I (m19) have been getting very painful deep cystic acne around my mouth and neck area. It has been like this for around a month and I half, before that I pretty much had clear skin. I went to the doctor about a month ago and got prescribed skinoren (am) and epiduo (pm). I have been using the products consistently in combination with cleansing and moisturizing. However I have noticed no change what so ever. My acne continues in the same spots and keeps being painful and irritating. I know these spots are usually related to hormonal fluctuations and therefore acne, but shouldn\u2019t it be getting a little better still? My skin feels inflamed and irritated, but stopping the prescribed medications only makes it worse.  \nI honestly don\u2019t know what to do anymore and it is really hurting my confidence. Any help would be greatly appreciated. ",

You need to take something to avoid pregnancy and they will test you every month to make sure you're not pregnant.  Good luck",

Essentially, I would do a three month cycle once a year right before the part of the year that I had the worst acne. This would get it manageable and help relieve the stress it induces. Getting the stress under control and truly truly never picking or popping or touching my face in any way helped so much. Staying on top of hydration and diet, keeping my home very clean, having a powerful air purifier, etc all aided in keeping it manageable. Now i have a few cysts here and there in the usually areas but healing time is very short \u2014 like 1 week when it used to feel like they would last for months.
