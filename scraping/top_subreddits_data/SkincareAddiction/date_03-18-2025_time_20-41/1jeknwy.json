    "selftext": "\nHey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m 28F and currently using an Origins sample pack, but im running low on these products and I\u2019m not super in love with them. No issues, but not super impressed by the ingredients in Origins and what I have now is lacking a retinol and SPF product. I\u2019m looking for a streamlined, low-maintenance skincare routine. I don\u2019t want to have to pick and choose between a bunch of different brands\u2014I just want something effective and consistent.\n\nMy main concerns are hydration and getting ahead of aging. I\u2019ve been eyeing Paula\u2019s Choice because of the solid reviews and cleaner, \u201cscience-backed\u201d ingredients, but I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s worth committing to a full routine from them. If you use their products, do you think an all-in approach makes sense? Are there any must-haves or things I should skip?\n\nAttached photos of my current routine and what the \u201cVirtual Skin Analyzer\u201d on Paula\u2019s Choice website suggested. \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts! Thanks in advance.\n\n",

The ingredients are all very complimentary so you don\u2019t get overloaded on any one ingredient, which is easy to do if you\u2019re mixing and matching. I use the light blue line and added in the peptide and vitamin c moisturizers.",

Of your list I use the vitamin C eye cream and the peptides. I\u2019ve also used the barrier cream before. I find that their stuff plays nice together as well as with other skincare and makeup. Other brands I\u2019ve used (ex: the ordinary) don\u2019t have a great texture to their stuff either and tend to pill when layered with other products or makeup.",

That and a lot of their products are things you have to layer together to get all the ingredients you want - which is great for people who know that they\u2019re doing, but I am not that person lol",

Their niacinimide is so sticky and their primer just like rolls off my face?! I have combo/oily skin, and am focussing on both pores/oil as well as anti aging for context.",
