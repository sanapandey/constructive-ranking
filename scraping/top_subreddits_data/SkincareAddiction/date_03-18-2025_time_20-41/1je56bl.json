    "selftext": "First 3 pics = November 2024\nLast 4 pics = March 2025\n\nLast year, I was constantly getting breakouts - especially around my nose (including under my glasses, even though I sanitized and cleaned them daily). I have an oily t-zone but products like salicylic acid, exfoliators, etc., for oily skin just dried it out/caused dry patches and didn\u2019t help much with the pimples. \n\nNot sure what triggered the breakouts (didn\u2019t change my diet or products or anything) so couldn\u2019t figure out how to stop them. I used to only get hormonal breakouts but I had these pimples for at least 3 months straight with no respite. One would go, another would appear. \n\nI started using The Ordinary\u2019s 10% Azelaic Acid suspension in October last year (2x a day) and my skin is so smooth and is way less inflamed/irritated! I get maybe one random pimple a month (definitely hormonal in that case) but it\u2019s much less common. \n\nDefinitely still an underrated product, and I\u2019ll sing its praises all day lol. \n\nCurrent routine:\n- Avene Gentle Foaming Cleanser \n- TO 10% Azelaic Acid\n- Clinique All About Eyes gel \n- Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturising Lotion\n- Beauty of Joseon SPF",
