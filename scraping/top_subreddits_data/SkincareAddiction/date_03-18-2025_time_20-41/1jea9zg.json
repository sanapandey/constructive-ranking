    "selftext": "my acne has cleared up significantly, i\u2019ve been struggling with it since i was around 8 years old. this is the smoothest my skin has been in so long. yes i have a few zits on my face but not as many as i did a few months ago. my only issue is that it looks like ive made no progress bc each pimple leaves behind a spot on my face, itll stay for months and sometimes ill even get a new pimple in the SAME SPOT which messes up the progress of it clearing up. it is slightly darker in person. Anyone know how to clear these up? or has anyone tried \u201cEven Better Clinical Dark Spot Clearing Serum with Vitamin C\u201d from Clinique? Has it worked?",
