            "body": "Retinoids can be great, but as you don't already have a skincare routine I'd start with a basic sunscreen, face wash, moisturiser combo. That gives you room to figure out what you do/don't like, how your skin reacts to things, and how much time/effort you're willing to invest.\u00a0\n\n\nChemist Warehouse or Priceline is a great place to start. Coles and Woolies also have a decent range.\u00a0\n\n\nSunscreen in the morning, reapply during the day if you're outside. The Cancer Council ones are a great basic sunscreen, I personally like the kids one best. The Dermaveen face sunscreen is my holy grail, but is a tad thick so not for everyone.\u00a0\n\n\nFace wash in the evening. The Neutrogena hydroboost one is great it you have drier skin. The brand QV is a solid all round option.\u00a0\n\n\nMoisturiser after face wash. There are a million and one different ingredients you could look into, depending on what you specifically want to target and your skin type. To start with I'd go for something pretty basic and gentle - Nivea, QV, Dermaveen, Dermal Therapy, and Cetaphil are brands that all have\u00a0simple, affordable, options.\u00a0\n\n\nThere is also an Aus skincare subreddit if you're interested in reading more product recommendations/discussions :)\u00a0\n\n\nEditing to add: I feel like physical exfoliants are somewhat controversial, but in my opinion if it's working for you,\u00a0 go for it. However, if you're doing it daily then I'd drop down to 2-3 times a week, and making sure you're not being too aggressive with it.\u00a0",

Over-exfoliating can harm your skin barrier, so a soft cleanser keeps your skin healthy and clean without stripping it. Look for ingredients like green tea or centella asiatica for soothing properties.\n2. **Moisturizer**\u00a0(AM & PM): Hydration is key for smooth, youthful skin. Opt for a lightweight moisturizer with ingredients like hyaluronic acid or ceramides to keep your skin plump and hydrated.\n3. **Sunscreen**\u00a0(AM): This is non-negotiable! A high-SPF sunscreen (SPF 50+ recommended) protects against sun damage, preventing fine lines and crow's feet from worsening. Look for lightweight, non-greasy sunscreens like the Etude House Sunprise or Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun.\n4. **Eye Cream or Serum**\u00a0(PM): To target crow's feet and eye bags, add an eye cream with peptides or niacinamide. These work to firm and brighten the under-eye area. Something like the Mizon Snail Repair Eye Cream is a budget-friendly yet effective option.\n5. **Optional Treat**\u00a0(2-3x per week): Include a sheet mask with anti-aging ingredients like ginseng or collagen for an indulgent hydration boost.",
