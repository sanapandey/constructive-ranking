It is flaky if you look up close, itchy and rough. The CeraVe anti aging night cream used to be my HG but burns my skin now.\n\n I was using beef tallow which works well for a couple hours and I start to get flaky. Then I ordered the illiyoon ceramide ato cream and same deal. I feel dry and itchy after a few hours. Trader joes daily moisturizer sucks right in like water and I'm instantly dry. I tried cosrx snail moisturizer and it sucked in like water as well and left me instantly dry.\n\n  \nYou can't really tell in the photos but my skin has red patches all over my cheeks. I also have eczema. ",
