My current routine is:\n\nDokdo Oil Cleanser\nDokdo Birchjuice Cleanser\nDokdo Hydrating Toner\nBeauty of Joseon Greenplum AHA + BHA Toner\nI'm From Mugwort Essence Hydrating toner \nMoisturizer\n\nMy question is, should I be applying the AHA+BHA Toner first after cleansing? If so how long should I wait for the actives to dry before applying the rest of my toners? And do I need to wait for my hydrating toners to dry before applying moisturizer? \n\n",
