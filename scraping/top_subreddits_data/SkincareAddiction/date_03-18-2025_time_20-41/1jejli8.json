    "selftext": "I just bought the Beauty of Joseon Eye Serum with Ginseng and Retinal. It\u2019s my first time ever using a product with retinol/retinal, and I wonder how I should go about patch testing it? (don\u2019t want to test it directly on my face, but idk where else?).\n\nAlso, is there anything I should keep in mind when starting with retinal based products? From what I\u2019ve gathered the concentration of the serum is pretty mild, but I do have really sensitive skin. Any input on the product is greatly appreciated:)",
