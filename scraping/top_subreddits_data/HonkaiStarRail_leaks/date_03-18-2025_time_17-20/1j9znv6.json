Bronya can be used as a Kafka alternative since she has a similar kit to her but can also but used together with her since their AA and FUA stacks well.\n\nEdit: grammar and added more ideas bc i keep taking this joke too seriously much longer than i should",

Hell Gallagher might also work him if you keep an ult charge before the duel so you can do a big punch > ult > big punch again. Lingsha might also be good cause he advances her pet every hit too so might add up decent toughness and no risk of dying.\n\nAS damage requirements tend to be pretty low once you can get into the break phase, so having \"deadweight\" chars wouldn't be an issue if you can still fit your core chars in.",

Besides FuA spam to beat his counter multiple times, Break teams can bruteforce the breaking yourself with Break teams.\n\nAnd as duel mode seems to disrupt FuA chains that FuA teams usually have, unless he locks his weakness, Break teams will work very well.",

The toughness looks like it'll be pretty tough to get through without eidolons (though shouldn't be too terrible with fugue + lingsha.) I wouldn't say it looks particularly difficult either though, if you're fine with your firefly without break blessings, this won't be any more difficult, but idt anyone already struggling with post break FF will find this fight easy\n\nAgree on the rest. Being single target with good element matchup (and triggering aventurine's fua) means feixiao and Bolthill are eating good (and toughness is *just* right for boothill), and the counter girls are ready to play wack a mole",
