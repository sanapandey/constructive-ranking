The dragon\"HP\" can be viewed as an energy pool, indicating how many breaths you can get out, and when she can use her ultimate. That means lower = better in 99% of cases because it allows her to charge ult much faster (unless you want to use the dragon as a tank, thats the only situation where it is good to have more HP)",

Because the spears limit max hp to 50% what happens is Gallagher heals himself with his ult and then the spears put his health back to 50% which Castorice interprets as lost hp and gets charge. At 3:24 when Nikador summons the spears Castorice does get charge from the lost hp so that part definitely works. It also would explain the aftermath of your second example when Tribbie does her follow up and Castorice jumps from 71% to 93%. Castorice gets 12% from Gallagher healing Tribbie plus 10% from Tribbie's hp getting drained back down by the spears.",

Like both of them a lot and honestly just want to have 1 \"OP\" character on my roster, happy with it being either of them.\n\nFrom showcases I saw of E2S1 mydei he seems like he's going to be a complete monster in current content. V3 Castorice paled in comparison. \n\nDo these changes make it likely that Castorice will be equal to or better than Mydei at E2S1 with similar team investment? \n\nAppreciate any insight!",
