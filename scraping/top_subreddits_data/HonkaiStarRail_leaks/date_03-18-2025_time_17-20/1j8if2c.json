Before we had a increase of dmg multiplier for multiple beams like 30%/34%/38%. now its 28%/34% for consecutive attacks. When dragon leaves, the self destruct nova bomb dmg reduced from 50% -> 40% of castorice max hp. Castorice consumes 40% -> 30% of allies current hp on normal skill mode. Castorice consumes 50% -> 40% of allies current hp on enhanced skill mode. When Castorice uses ultimate and summons the dragon, dragon spd changed from 140 spd to 165 spd.( 1 extra turn i believe now) Now interesting part is the traces. The trace responsible for charging the dragon, before it was 15% newbud max limit.(stamen nova or whatever you want to call it) or dragon's max hp. its changed to 12% now. but important part is accumulated conversion reset after any all action.\n\nshe is a little bit less risky. overall they balanced her dmg by doing some nerf on numbers and also added a trace to balance things(it is conditional but good overall for endgame also).  \nThis was expected to happen.   \nHer bis team is looking like: Castorice, sunday, tribbie, luocha/hyacine(upcoming bis healer for Castorice).  \nSpecially sunday e1 and tribbie e1 are good for dmg boost.",
