Flagship characters naturally get more budget but even Tribbie animations are improvements over the first harmony (Ruan Mei)\n\nSummons showing in idle isn't even a new thing, Clara, Topaz, and Aglaea all have it.

Some get more budget than others because they're expected to sell better but they're all equally manufactured based on Hoyo's research of popular tropes and survey data.\n\nLook at Phainon, you can't tell me with a straight face he isn't marketed to \"manipulate you into liking him\", he is practically the main character of Amphoreus. Whether the quality of writing and marketing is done well is a subjective matter yet people act like Castorice (and previously Firefly) is the only character to ever get marketed",

Not only that, but we know every part of Tribios has a very short life span after gaining the titan\u2019s power, as they will cease to exist after using too many gates. We know Mydei will die with a wound on his back, and Aglaea will die in a golden bath. Every flame chaser except presumably Phainon will die before the end, the only one who will likely escape this via a loophole is the mc in 3.2, and maybe Dan Heng if he joins (I haven\u2019t been looking too much into those leaks). This isn\u2019t Penacony, where it was already established death isn\u2019t possible. 3.1\u2019s entire theme is about accepting loss, whether it be Trianne, Mydei\u2019s companions, Phainon\u2019s home, or even the scholars from the grove whom you personally report about to their loved ones. \n\nAlso this is just my opinion/ observation, but a character dying only makes people more attached to them. For example, most people didn\u2019t realize Aventurine survived in 2.1, and he became one of the most beloved characters not just due to meta but also his story. You can even see it with Trianne, people feel emotionally attached to characters the more those characters suffer<! \nSorry for essaying lmao",
