It\u2019s both a shitty precedent and blatant powercreep in one, especially since this passive doesn\u2019t replace anything in her kit as a DPS and is effectively free value.\n\nWhat you\u2019re saying effectively is: \u201chey, i know people spent up to $600 worth of jades on a revive passive on a previous character, but it\u2019s awesome that this new character has it for cheaper, and better too!\u201d\n\nWhy not just raise your middle finger at older players and just outright work for hoyoverse if you\u2019re going to defend decisions like this?\n\nThey also designed an entire UI window specifically for global passives, so it\u2019s not just speculation, it\u2019s practically confirmed that they\u2019re working on them for future characters, they wouldn\u2019t have designed a UI for it if it was exclusive to Castorice. This isn\u2019t just opening the door for future global passives, the door is already wide open. The doomposting is the players\u2019 attempt at closing it before it\u2019s too late (once this goes live, it will be a permanent mechanic addition to the game).\n\nYou don\u2019t have to participate in the doomposting if you don\u2019t care, but to call it toxic is literally victim blaming because this increases future FOMO potential in a goddamned gacha game.",

The point is It's only gonna get worse, if this is the baseline of what they're willing to add. Now you don't just need these 3 specific characters to make X \"work,\" you also need X because they give X to everything. It's only gonna get more predatory, instead of just 3 characters for a team, you're gonna need more and more as they continue to add more global passives. Plain and simple, it's predatory.

Castorice's passive is not particularly impactful: if you didn't bring a sustain it only gives you up to one extra turn (and since you get revived at 1 HP, it's very easy for just any stray hit to knock you down before you even get said turn), and if you brought a sustain you really shouldn't be dying. \n\nThe complaints mostly come in the form of \"but this could lead to future more impactful global passives, like what if there's one that gives the whole party 30% CRIT Rate once you pull them?\" and honestly I feel like that's just pure fearmongering. The existence of global passives doesn't mean that this is going to happen. Could you imagine if people saw Acheron's normal mob instakill technique and said \"this is terrible, what if one day they make a Technique that lets you instakill Elites and Bosses\"? Or if people saw Topaz's Credit-granting Technique and said \"what if one day they make a similar Technique that gives Stellar Jades\"? It's frankly just ridiculous imo.",

It looks like developers tried to balance it out by making it so that as long as you have Castorice, the buff is in effect. \n\nBasically: Acheron = more relevant with a cost; Castorice = less relevant with no cost\n\nJust wanted to bring up this point of view for ppl to think about",

I mean, there's somewhat a point to be made here and I agree the fearmongering is getting a bit exaggerated (I personally don't think this is worth dropping the game over lol but that's just me) but the thing is that none of the current examples have directly affected the endgame while this one does, and it's not really insignificant, this could entirely enable some accounts to do sustainless clears that they otherwise shouldn't be able to do.\n\nLike don't get me wrong I don't think the revive is genuinely meta defining of course and I'm not saying they're gonna make \"pull this character and you auto-clear side 1\" but the fact that it directly affects the endgame while these examples explicitly do not is something you can't just ignore, especially since no one would care if Castorice's worked the same and didn't trigger if she's not in the team or hell if it was an overworld ability only.\n\nI think my main thing is that surely you can understand that while it's not game-breaking it would just be healthier for the game if it didn't work on endgame right? Like there's literally zero downside to that happening lol.\n\nAlso note how we actually had a small slope effect with going from Numby sniffing out chests vs Herta straight up showing them in the map lol",

It will enable fringe sustainless clears but not that many, since once again it essentially only prolongs your life by a single hit and you get only a maximum of one extra turn in a sustainless clear. At most I think it'll be an RNG mitigator, where it can save a clear if the enemy's final action(s) unluckily all target the same ally, but I think making originally impossible clears possible is far less likely. \n\nI don't think the passive should work in endgame but I also don't think one data point can be called a bad precedent. In general I dislike the argument of \"this thing has an attribute that is not a large problem in this case, but would be problematic if applied somewhere else, so instead of targeting the problematic application I will use a scorched earth strategy and say it's all bad\". It would be like if people looked at RMC's True Damage as a function of original damage (which is a fair mechanic) and said \"now that True Damage is in the game, it is only a matter of time before we get a character that can deal True Damage directly to enemies and Hoyo will crank up enemy RES and damage reduction to make them meta and phase everyone else out, so True Damage is a bad mechanic\". For Castorice's passive, I would call it tangibly useful, but not meta defining or dare I say not even really that powerful, and I think it's silly to act like its existence guarantees that a meta defining global passive will exist in the future (especially with how many of the justifications are \"because Hoyo is evil\").\n\nAs someone who owns both Topaz and The Herta I found that while both are chest detectors they both are useful to me in different situations. Because Numby's detection is a constant aura that is always active, I find Topaz still greatly useful when running through a map the first time so Numby can point out any chests I run vaguely through the vicinity of, which in turn helps reduce the number of remaining chests when I clean up whatever I didn't get with Herta.",

Encouraging people to pull on characters they don't want, and won't use, because they will benefit their entire account sets a bad precedent for the game as a whole. The whole reason players put up with 50/50s and massive pity amounts is because they don't need every character. I'm lucky this time that it won't impact me because I wanted Castorice regardless. But it's so easy to visualize the problem. If this was on Anaxa, who I do not want, I would hate that.\n\nThe mechanic doesn't only enable fringe sustainless clears. Even in 3.0/3.1, in addition to HP inflation, bosses have also started to hit harder. Giving your whole account the Bailu mechanic can absolutely have an impact for a lot of players. Which in a vacuum sounds good. It's helping out players who are struggling. But what about the players who are struggling who didn't like Castorice's design/story/gameplay/whatever. Well now they're in a crappy situation.\n\n  \nAnd here's the thing, if it's actually no big deal and irrelevant... then why put it in the game?

But it's pretty obvious that there has been a slow creep up. We started out with extremely minor convenience features, like Lunae's sprint. Then we got to ones that were useful, like Acheron's instant kill or Topaz/Herta's treasure hunting. Then we got to one that does actually impact endgame modes slightly.\n\nThe issue also is that these global passives inherently stack. Even if they only release ones at the power level of Castorice forever - minor one time shields when you enter a battle, if an enemy has less than 0.5% hp remaining after taking damage they're instantly killed, stuff like that - those are all extremely minor effects. But if each passive, individually, helps maybe 1% of MoC runs clear, as you pool them up and combine them, players who have all of them start to get noticeably advantaged. Castorice's passive individually isn't a major problem, but if in 5 years we have a dozen characters with global passives with similar levels of power, then that would be a problem.\n\nAnyone screaming about how they'll release 30% crit buffs via this system is exaggerating, but unless they literally never release another system or mechanic like this again - unlikely, given they're adding UI elements for it - it will eventually become a problem.",

In a MoC floor with a 2-phase boss that basically means one turn to one shot wave 1 and one turn to one shot each phase of the boss: are you really sure? \n\nI'm still not convinced by the idea of \"utility creep\". Even Castorice's endgame-affecting utility is still within the power level of what I'd consider minor utility. I suppose this line depends on the individual, but until I see a passive that will actually make a significant difference to the majority of clears (like the hypothetical initial shield one you mentioned, now that one really shouldn't exist), I can't really buy into the idea that we will get these global passives that will hold large sway over endgame meta. \n\nI do have to point out that it is not necessarily true that you will be able to stack all future global passives. It would be trivial to start introducing conditions to global passives that prevent many from being active at once. Castorice's may not have an explicitly defined condition but requiring an ally to die to do anything is in of itself a condition, considering the relative rarity of said occurrence. Whether anything of the sort will actually happen is of course speculation, but it is definitely not an absolute truth that it will eventually become a problem.",

Just getting her to enhanced state takes one turn. Firefly depletes 120 Toughness across 3 targets per Enhanced Skill. Assuming Ruan Mei is doing 2 Basics, HMC 3 skills, Fugue 2 EBAs, and one Fugue Ult, that's 360 from Firefly, 225 from HTB, 30 from RM, and 210 Toughness from Fugue, assuming every multi-target skill hits maximum targets. That's 825 Toughness damage. A MoC stage tends to have about 600 Toughness across all enemies: I have serious doubts that a little over 200 Toughness damage worth of Super Break + 2x Break damage from main and Exo-Toughness breaking is enough to beat a whole MoC's worth of HP.\n\n(Incidentally, my own Firefly sustainless tends to beat in 3-4 cycles. I don't think my Firefly is particularly well built so it can probably be shaved down further from my general performance but I really find it difficult to believe that, at least at E0S0 levels, it can be shaved down to 3-4 turns.)",

A semi-decent build on any of them should always be sustain-positive, meaning the enemy should never dish out more damage over time than they can recover/block. (This isn't to say that other sustains like Lynx or Gepard are completely incapable but there is a gulf between them and the limited ones/Gallagher and against the most aggressive enemies you can feel the pinch.) This does mean that Castorice's passive will be more significant if you're bringing someone like Natasha or Lynx and the revive makes the difference between clearing and failing, but honestly I don't think it's too harmful in the grand scheme of things that people having to make do with those are thrown a bone. I suppose you could argue that this gives Hoyo \"justification\" to push the damage floor of enemies higher to balance around Castorice, but as with the other similar complaints this falls into the realm of pure hypotheticals. \n\nIf you're bringing like Fu Xuan or Lingsha or Aventurine into MoC and you're dying it's either the sustain doesn't have enough stats, there's some misplay involved (e.g. advancing out of Aventurine's shields, or being too stingy with SP given to the sustain), or in some cases a specific counter-gimmick (e.g. Fu Xuan into Nikador struggles more).",

It's not like everyone all at once quits the second they start not liking something. It's progressive. TV shows that get bad often have high ratings still even while they've been bad for six months. But then they start dropping. And dropping. And then it gets canceled. I'm not saying HSR is at death's door or something, but if people are unhappy, we'll start seeing that around a year from when the unhappiness began, not the second it starts coming up. You need to react before the criticism gets too entrenched, because once things are trending down, it's hard to turn that around (for example: the 3.1 story is a top 5 HSR story and yet the sting from 2.6-3.0 hasn't allowed that sentiment to flourish in the community like it should, and in the opposite direction, when they were cooking with Penacony 2.0-2.2, they could do no wrong even if there were some issues starting to crop up that developed into Developer Radio level problems later)",

But the storytelling IS rough and makes that story I prefer less fun. I had way more fun with ZZZ 1.4 than I did with HSR 3.0 even though I care so much more about the HSR characters and am more invested in the HSR story because of the way they'd been telling it. And we see the difference with 3.1. They added more CG, they added more of the single pane animations that people enjoy, they actually used the black screen primarily for its original purpose (comedy... with the Mydei/Phainon sauna bit where it was cleverly implying something else was happening with Mydei and Phainon), etc. And it made an already damn good character story for Tribbie and Mydei pop so much harder than it would have with 3.0s wall of text story delivery.\n\n\\- Character power creep - Prydwen isn't the be-all, end-all obviously, but when you see the characters SO stratified by release date on there it's really bad. You don't really see that with other games to the same degree we're seeing it with HSR right now. There are usually some characters that manage to sneak through at the top tier long after their release. We're at the point where, already, the only T0 DPS in HSR are ones that released in 3.x. That's just too propulsive that it's unsustainable. There's no Jinhsi or Neuvillette or Hu Tao here. It's just newer is always better no matter what.",

Her traces have been shuffled around a bit, some stuff on the traces became core parts of her kit to add different traces.\n\nThe overall is that she's much easier to play now. Instead of charging off overhealing, she recharges the dragon based on healing itself. Any healing while the dragon is down can recharge her meter by up to 12% per ally target per turn, and any healing on allies while the dragon is up directly gives it HP as well.\n\nCastorice's skill HP consumption also got lowered by 10% on regular and enhanced to make things a little easier on that front (30% unenhanced, 40% enhanced).\n\nThe Dragon's damage was nerfed across the board, but that's because Castorice has a new 3rd trace which increases the dragon's damage based on the enemy's missing HP.\n\nAs a quick estimate, the dragon will probably be doing 14\\~% less damage vs. max HP enemies, but the damage bonus goes all the way up to 40% when the enemy is at 30% HP. You're gaining 4% damage for every 7% HP the enemy loses, so you should be doing equal damage to the current build after a quarter of the enemy's HP is down.  \n(And a good 26\\~% more when it fully ramps up.)\n\nIt's very imprecise math because the ratio that the multipliers are different differs based on what level of dragon breath you're using, but that's just to give an idea of what numbers you should be expecting.\n\nTl:dr; she got much easier to play with all active healing now contributing to dragon recharge and dragon HP, her skill HP consumption being lower. Her Dragon Damage was nerfed but scales off enemies' current HP now.",

Mydei really shouldn't be in the damage comparisons here, he's not really up there at all without Eidolons all over the team.

(I don't actually know who was first because I wasn't there though.....)\n\nCastorice's team is highly specific, and she's mostly AoE focused so your mileage is going to vary extremely heavily. I think Therta is better right now overall in a lot of content. She has easier teams with less janky supports, and still does pretty amazing single target damage, but Castorice has some bosses it feels like she suits well (besides the fight that's *actually* made for her).\n\nI think Castorice might be stronger in that content than even Acheron, who is almost entirely AoE focused. But I'd say even Acheron's teams are far less specific and precise when it comes to using them than Castorice, you kinda just mash debuffs and ult and that's that.\n\nAglaea is a weird one because she takes the most support out of any of the current top DPS, but has the potential to be almost *the* top performer in everything. If you can gear her well and you have all the supports for her, she might be the strongest DPS in the game. But that's a really big fat *if*, she's so incredibly demanding to both play and prepare for (without shelling out for Eidolons or her Light Cone which makes things vastly easier) that it's hard to tell if it's worth it until you have it (at which case it absolutely is).\n\nThere's still one more version left which is likely to have gameplay changes, so my opinion could very well change when that comes out. But this is what I think of the situation right now.",

He does similar DPS to Therta in a Blast situation, and he may be better if there's strictly 3 beefy targets. But Therta is the queen against 4-5 targets and if there's some weak chaff to go after, and her kit makes her more usable in waaaaaay more content.\n\nI've seen the crushing damage that Mydei's capable of doing, but he's also very greedy for supports that everyone else also wants right now. RMC, Sunday, and Tribbie are all teammates he potentially wants. Which is fine if you're determined to use him, but if you have other options is Mydei really the strongest DPS choice with those supports?\n\nThe gear struggle may be a bit more personal, but I think it's also really significant here. I didn't have much trouble building a non-optimal Aglaea that still puts out pretty nutty damage (with Sunday on the team). Castorice has Poet set and her speed passive, which help immensely with her gearing situation.\n\nThe minimum it takes to get Mydei to reach the floor of being good feels so much more difficult by comparison. The crit rate is one thing, but he also needs to build his own speed most of the time and an insane amount of crit damage. At the level of gear that the buffed out showcase Mydeis are at, Therta is effortlessly 0-cycling with that same level of gear.\n\nI talked about how specific Castorice teams are, but compared to Mydei, Castorice is practically rolling her face on the keyboard and is running circles around him damage wise. I'd say their damage is a lot more even now, but Castorice's ceiling is so much higher than Mydei's it's not even funny (and that's with or without Eidolons!!!!).\n\nI'm still pulling him over Castorice, but I would be lying if I thought he was stronger than her.",

It was also followed by a full rerun + new standard character patch, giving people plenty of time to save for the next characters.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nComplaining about how 5.3 was handled is definitely valid, but comparing it to HSR is like saying dust on the mantle is as bad as a hoarder house full of newspaper stacks soaked in cat piss.\u00a0",

The character needs to survive with 1hp until the next turn, has no DoT on them and doesn't get hit by any ST or AoE attacks. Then they will need to be able finish the final enemy before that turn ends. The chance for this to happen is quite small it can be replaced with better RNG, and without Castorice buff the player can retry it anyway.\n\nRegarding your example about the slippery slope effect, I think it is the opposite. With the release of Herta, MHY also gave all players a gadget that has the same function. I think this is a proof that MHY does want to prevent making one character too OP that it upgrades the whole account.",

Especially FF where BOTH her first two eidolons add core functionality to her kit with the skill point from E1 and extra turn from E2. \n\nFeixiao is a well designed character from that standpoint. She feels complete at E0, but can ult more often and do more damage at E2. Her E2 is really powerful, but I never feel like she's stuck in the mud at E0, and can still clear all of the endgame at E0 with a good team and good relics.",

Still, as long as casto has less than 13750 hp thats a buff, so not bad to make her team safer\n\n3. Damage changes\u2014 damage multiplier got decreased but with the added damage% buff it looks like an overall buff?\n\n4.

Her dupes are worse than Herta's so she has less value if you want to consolidate teams, she is forced to use a healer generally speaking, while not really recieving much compensation for it, which at her current power, just is going to make her drag behind sustainless comps of other DPS. She'll look good against the new boss being shilled for her currently, but that's about it.\n\nNot going to lie, I'm a bit bewildered that this is the state of a big anniversary DPS lol. She's just sort of mid when you adjust for prior trends in power vs. release timing. If we don't see buffs in v4 or v5, she's a pretty safe skip for those who are indifferent to her as a character. I'd genuinely say to just wait for a Herta rerun as of right now if you are pulling for meta, or wait to see how future DPS turn out. But, make sure to see if v4 or v5 makes her more competitive or not since in the past some DPS did get some pretty solid late term buffs.",

Right now I don't see why she shouldn't fall of the wagon just as Blade did, just as Mydei will. (okay not just like, since at least she's not reliant on getting attacked). She's the anniversary unit, she'll inevitably get compared to Acheron, a unit that even a year after her release is still competing with the best across all endgame modes. This will not be the case with her bis team releasing back to back to back, both her relic sets being available already and crappy scaling options.\n\nPS. No I'm not advocating powercreep here either just because that's inevitably going to get brought up. I'm advocating a smooth power curve with gradual updates for longevity. That doesn't work with shit multipliers, oversaturated buffs and BiS released all at once. In other words I would've been perfectly happy with Acheron not being as busted as she was (as to not powercreep everyone else by so much) but JQ was a great addition to her after all the patches inbetween.\n\nTL;DR Cas will have peaked in 3.3 what's she gonna do in 3.4, 3.5 and so on AFTER you're already  at least 4 likely 6 cost deep?",

The revive is essentially useless but very problematic in terms of design space it occupies. She's a good buff for 3b I admit with the \\~40k hp of her and the dragon but again that's not the point i'm making, it's not about her powerlevel when she drops it's about how she'll age (getting hyacine with 3.3 is not aging, also it's a sustainer, technically a useless unit if you already have plenty of sustainers but they thought about how to avoid the FF not wanting lingsha scenario with the HP drain, FF's best team is objectively the sustainless one and it's comfortable to play even in most DU runs)",

However, those people, who are rational human beings just like us, must have ran assumptions and concluded that whatever hit to PR, game balance, etc etc. this is, it's canceled out by something else. Maybe that's because they think money lost from dissatisfied players will be recouped by people pulling out of FOMO or concerns about getting powercrept or whatever, maybe it's because they think the PR hit can be mitigated by some other amount of goodwill-building like the 50/50 change, maybe it's because they think this'll be a momentary hit to the finances that they can recoup long term by normalizing global passives and using them to sell more characters later. \n\nIt's impossible to tell **why** they think this is a good idea, but without a doubt it's not because it simply hasn't occurred to them that this is a bad idea. They know all the reasons we think it's bad and they also recognize that they are bad; they simply think there's some good here that can outweigh the bad, and when we're talking about **financial good**... unfortunately, they may very well be correct.",

My 4 man premium Break team and someone else's identical break team is now forever different. It's one thing if a new relic or powerful character upends team comps and the meta, but this is just an account buff. Buying permanent power. If they threw a crappy banner up for someone you don't want, said if you roll them you can level everyone up to 100 - how is that any different? \n\nPowercreep is one thing, a bricked account because you didn't roll for the +crit% guy six patches ago (rerunning sometime next year) is another. You want your perfect follow-up team? I hope you didn't skip on the three random break characters you didn't want that boost your damage and speed. Oh, you didn't get those? Well, the endgame modes just assume that you did because the devs want the people who are spending money on all of these extra power boosts to feel challenged and they don't really care about the low-spenders like you.

Let's break down the issues shall we?\n\nFirstly, let's not pretend that just because the revive does not help you clear faster means that it is not a big deal. If you are a newer player with a weaker roster of sustains, the revive that Castorice provide is undoubtedly a form of FOMO that significantly reduces the risk of a character dying in endgame. A lot of day 1 players, sitting with Lingsha and Aventurine in their parties, really forget how dangerous enemies are in MOC 12 and AS4 with weaker guaranteed sustains like Lynx (Gallagher is not guaranteed for an account). Castorice singlehandedly reduces any risk of dying for just pulling her on an account and if that isn't FOMO for newer players idk what is.\n\nAlso, the more pressing issue is the idea of precedent. With Castorice's global passive working even in parties without her, what is stopping the HSR devs from implementing future passive that are even more predatory? The idea is fundamentally that we should not encourage a GACHA company to implement FOMO mechanics that entail just pulling a specific character. If HSR sees that they can get away with global passive on Cas, what's stopping them from giving their next favorite child character a global 15% crit rate buff from pulling them? And if people fall for it and account strength inevitable increases, they can justify further powercreep in terms of character kit and enemy HP bloat.\n\nTLDR: Global passives are an egregious form of FOMO and its implementation sets a dangerous precedent that have a strong probability of further spiraling the games poor end game balance.",

After that we have come to the edge of a slippery slope, slipped over and fumbled down off of it to whatever pit of crap waits at the end of it. All in the span of a few seconds. They are baiting even more players to spend more on the game and the dumbasses WILL DO IT. They are gonna give us a special kinda dupe picker for failed 50/50? That's great cause in the future a lot of people who have a special new characters they want AND also wants their account to stay relevant even somehow now essentially need, at worst, TWICE more tickets to clear their goals. The character they want and the characters their \"account strenght needs\". \n\n\n*Example:*\n\nPast: Wow, Kafka looks nice. I'll save for her.\n\n\nFuture: Wow, this new more skimpier, more mommy 5-Star Kafka looks nice. But that new dumb looking toddler character is also coming and she gives that sweet account wide 15% plus to damage. Damn, i guess i have to get the monthly pass so i have a better chance of getting them both.\n\n\nLet's say you are complete dry on tickets. Surely i don't have to futher drive home the point and putting the number difference here. Just how much more tickets you will need to get 2 characters instead of 1. And it does basically limit your options. Like when Aventurine and Acheron dropped, i got a two monthly passes but didn't feel cheated in any way or forced to pull on them. I liked them both and the content was great at the time. Change that situation a bit and everything becomes a lot fishier. Let's say the content was poor and instead of going for two characters i love, the game forces to get Acheron, a stupid gag character i have zero interest on, and after that Aventurine drops. Suddenly i don't clear, maybe i give up on Acheron lc which i also really wanted for this one stupid character that i'm actually not that interested in. That would leave a really bad taste in my mouth. We are close to getting there. And i will put my money exactly were my mouth is. I will tell them why i'm going to quit and then i will do just that. And i won't be putting money into any other of their bait-and-switch games either!\n\n\nTldr: They are essentially forcing a lot of players to gather twice the amount of tickets to \"clear a patch\". Cause they can't just go for one character they actually thinks lools cool, there also might another character that has the global passive they need. And since they probably do just what you would expect them to do. In the future every time they have two new characters coming up one of them will be more interesting and they won't have a global passive. And ofcource the other character is more boring and with a global passive. Or perhaps every time they under-cook a character they just go: \"damn, this character is pretty lame, damn, thank god we can just slap a global passive on it, and force players to spend money that way!\" \ud83d\ude05",

Acheron to this day is still more sig reliant than almost anyone else (Cas is going to enter the competition for this spot soon too), the build structure of theirs is also similar down to the eidolon investment too. One thing to note though is that Acheron is probably more comfortable to play than Cas, and so are the rest of the carries named here except JL, bc having someone naturally drain your entire team hp to give you in return something you can already achieve with another unit but minus the risk isn't doing too much.\n\nLike I stated, the problem isn't Castorice since she's not a broken or crazy unit in terms of dmg, nor the passive by itself because it's useless 90% of the time; the problem is what they can do in the FUTURE if people allow them to bring this passive to live servers.",

So the global passive is still basically useless. Since she's less risky to play now, unless you're totally unprepared for endgame you aren't dying anyways. With some vertical investment I never felt a need to get a new Shiny DPS for the next flavor of the month waifu/husbando to be shilled anyways. So honestly, it feels rather redundant to me for Castorice. She'll be good but I can't say I'm as interested. Meh.",

I wrote this after reading countless comments comparing Castorice against Aglaea E1 with Sunday E1S1 calling Castorice mid, and also with Acheron E2 and even Firefly, saying that Firefly's own damage is lower but her teammates dealing more damage to make up for it. Just search through the comments before pretending someone is making shit up. Astounding to approach a random person on the internet assuming instantly you know what they are talking about, to attack them. Embarrassing.\n\nThe point of what I was saying is that if a player is dissatisfied, the only real way of showing it is to avoid giving money to the company they are dissatisfied with. If one is just yelling at people that one is unhappy yet doing nothing to change it, is it not obvious who is at fault? I don't even care about which pixel character is stronger than the other, I am just drawing attention to the pointlessness of the squabbles here.\n\nPeople that do this pissing contest seem to be more interested in spending money on the character they are obsessed with to make them look better and then fight about it on the internet. Instead they should do their part to get their environment to be better for them. Looks like you are among the ones who like to yell at people and insult them though, judging by your comment.

Do they change your global experience? Yes, by a lot. Still i did not see anyone complaining. DU is still an endgame mode that gives you even more jades than the actual endgame mode. Do you need them to complete DU? NO. So i guess that this will be the case for global passives.\n\n\nIn that specific scenario, if they release this global passive, we can't tell what they are planning. If they want to release more of them and most important: we don't know if they want to ever release relevants global passives as \" bonus in attack/speed/hp\" i honestly hardly doubt it. As i said, castorice effect is basically irrelevant/useless if you are at least a decent starrail player.\n\n\nI do not like the idea of global passives too, but if they really want to release it and they are just as useless as this, i'm ok with it.\n\n\nMy advice is that: since many players are whining no stop for this and can't really accept that, you have a strong tool in yoir hand to make them rethink about it: DON'T PULL CASTORICE.\u00a0\n\n\nIf castorice does not sell, they will understand that something went wrong.\nIf you whine no stop and then pull castorice, well that is just pointless and useless.\n\n\nI personally will pull her, cause, as i said, this is not as big of a deal for me and i'm not that pessimistic to think thst they are so stupid to ruin their entire game",

They're obviously used to incentivise people to pull new characters, but think of the alternatives. You obviously give them good designs and animations, which HSR is doing in spades, but when it comes to incentivising via power and account value (which matter to a lot of people, nobody would complain about a global passive if it didn't,) you either make the content only easily clearable by more recent characters and keep powercreep at the current or an even more accelerated pace, they force you to require more teams in endgame content or they make it so the new characters enable the older characters to clear.  \n  \nThis could be in the way that Jing Yuan kept getting brand new supports to fix his weaknesses or more indirectly with a buff for owning them. Castorice's passive will enable you to run riskier teams more consistently. You can already run sustainless comps with older DPS and Cas just makes it safer to do so. It's not even great for her teams since she wants to be healed all the time and the Dragon prevents the team from dying. Even in the event that they do continue the powercreep route on top of passives, Castorice will always have value by being on your account unlike a character like SW that's just gathering dust.\n\nI know that a lot of the dislike is not necessarily this passive in particular, but the idea of global passives at all. If a character gave something like +100% CDmg if you own them, then yeah, that's very concerning but we aren't there and there's no indication we'll get there. It's a slippery slope fallacy to believe that a revive now equals a character that removes a healthbar from any boss that has multiple in future. We just have to view it in the context of what we have. Castorice's current kit is not stronger than Herta's, so HP doesn't need to increase to match a new tier of power and the passive does benefit other teams more than Cas herself. The passive, plus banner changes, plus old character buffs makes me feel like they're dedicated to making old characters good options as long as you keep playing and pulling, which is all Hoyo as a business wants. They probably don't care if you play the same team for years as long as you're still pulling new characters. Genshin showed us how that works for years.",

On the surface at least, it seems like Hoyo either wants to push enhanced skill a little more with this build, which I really like, or is hoping this brings it more in line with the breath+fast detonation style. Should be very good for her RemStelle synergy specifically.",

In general, you want Castorice and Sunday to go directly before her Dragon's second turn, which previously was at 140 SPD since it went below 50% HP in its first turn. Now since it has a constant speed, you need 165+ speed on both Castorice and Sunday... Pretty achievable for Castorice with SPD boots and her 40% self buff, but getting a 165+ SPD Sunday is difficult without sacrificing his crit damage. Now since overhealing doesn't give any stacks, the low HP of all allies after 2 consecutive Castorice skills could prove a very fast way to get the dragon back through healing. But overall the removal of her overhealing synergy means that it's going to be a lot harder to get her Dragon back, as the AoE spam + Gallagher combo doesn't work for her anymore.",
