    "selftext": "> ## Rule 2 Changes\n> In light of the increasing quantity of showcases, we've decided to amend Rule 2: showcases must now be posted as a comment under the version's pinned showcase megathread. Please include a link to the showcase, and a detailed caption with all the names of the characters used and specify the boss or the game mode they're engaging in. Use spoiler tags as needed. Builds details also have to be included either in the video itself or in further detail in the comment.\n\nPlease use this thread as a hub for 3.2 character/team showcases.\n\nAll top-level comments must be showcases, like so:\n> *link to showcase here*  \n> *names of the characters used, and the boss/game mode they're engaging in*  \n> *additional information (build details, comments, etc)*\n\nBuild details must either be included as additional information, or otherwise shown in the video.\n\nFeel free to discuss showcases in the replies to a commented showcase. **Non-showcase top-level comments will be removed.**",

The Crit Rate/Crit DMG for Anaxa is doable, I think.\n\nThe team is too cheap to bruteforce with bad builds, but I did 2\\~3 cycles against Hoolay of 2.5 (mostly 3, I got 2 once). I saw videos of people doing 2 more easily with Lingsha instead of Gallagher.\n\nAventurine is also 2-3 cycle, more for 2 than 3. Depends on the dice RNG.\n\nYou can probably get 1 cycle less with Anaxa's lightcone and a better build. If you have Herta E0S1, Anaxa E0S1, Tribbie, Lingsha, you can probably do a 1 cycle or at most a comfortable 2 cycles.\n\nIt's also an easy 3 cycles against the new 3.2 boss (with the bad builds), unfortunately you lose 1 cycle just waiting for the boss to enter his weak state, but after that it's a piece of cake. If you use Anaxa's LC + eagle build, it's 2 cycles.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/yLpMIQy](https://imgur.com/a/yLpMIQy)",

                                    "body": "I think a major part that changed was the showcases themselves?\n\n\nBeen following leaks for awhile and I don't think I've seen this high % of showcases with faulty builds, unfair comparisons, and samey teams+setups. Castorice being such a hyped character meant that the front page was flooded with these too.\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n**Castorice**, in particular brought a *huge* influx of showcases. Problem was, a lot of them used the exact same team+build (with only minor changes to stats) which ended up being spammy. There was also a lot of weirdly badly built supports too? Luocha (and to a lesser degree Sunday and Lingsha) were often built poorly compared to RMC/Tribbie/Gallagher which people were (understandably) negative on as this was often in comparison showcases. Luocha being such an early character, who has a <1min Google search away from a better build than those showcases made it seem especially negative considering how much people were hoping Luocha could be brought back into playability via Castorice.\n\n\nFor **Anaxa**, he didn't have a lot of showcases, and the ones he did were almost all THerta based teams even when it was pointed out his early numbers showed he was better in hypercarry/non erudition teams than hers. With THerta he was usually built as a support/subdps vs more pure sub-dps so his damage was pretty shit (even considering preV4 numbers) while charactera like Jade were built much more competently. Even after people pointed out fixes to his build the suboptimal builds were still the most common.\u00a0\n\n\nThat's not even mentioning the weirdly high amount of mislabeled costs on the showcases, (worst of all on comparison showcases)!\n\n\n--------\n\n\nPersonally I think it's beta players not knowing better + rushing out videos so they didn't actually record new stuff in between feedback. However I can't help but feel like there was some ill intent or lack of care when you'd see the same tester \"acknowledge\" the advice, but then go on to release a new batch of showcases with the same bad builds a week later with the new version.\u00a0\n\n\n**TL;DR:** Castorice's popularity brought a huge flood of showcases of varying quality. People trying to get showcases out fast led to bad builds, mislabeled costs, and unfair comparison showcases along with certain characters (Luocha, Anaxa, Lingsha) having worse builds than their comparisons in a majority of showcases all lead to a lot of negativity in the community.",

Not in Pure Fiction, but let's be real here, Herta doesn't need improvements in Pure Fiction.\n\nAPOC? Anaxa is leagues above Serval, Mini Herta or Jade. People make comparisons using the TVs (the same for moc), but the TVs are so easy for AOE that it doesn't matter if he doesn't improve Herta againt that boss, we need to take a look against other bosses.\n\nHoolay? Herta without Anaxa wouldn't even be capable of doing that boss with her usual teams. The same for Kafka as we can see in the showcase above .\n\nBe it because of his toughness or because of his weakness implant, he is just perfect for her there. With Anaxa you can use Therta against 90% of APOC bosses and it would work.\n\nAnd then MOC. Whatever Jade, Serval or Mini Herta gives you, Anaxa gives you and more. Why? His damage may not be the highest out there, but he's giving 50x more damage than Serval and Mini Herta while also being close to Serval as battery. It's the best of both words with what we have right now.\n\nSo you have an Erudition who gives ok/good damage (specially against 2/3 targets, the only scenario Therta needs help) while also being one of the best batteries for The Herta.\n\nIs Anaxa NECESSARY? RIGHT NOW he is not, but the AOE meta won't last forever, so he will be more valuable for Therta in the future as he is the last erudition we'll have in 3x.\n\nLast for those who invest in few teams: Therta's team has the best vertical investiment in the game, so if you're thiking about that, it's worth a shot too.",

But it gets really awkward with *how* E2 enables 6 breaths, because the extra breaths are tied to two one-time free uses, which is fine if you're blowing the dragon up immediately, but if you want to keep it around for longer you can't bank the free uses, you either need to use them up the first time and not have the full damage stack for the final explosion, or waste a ton of healing on the dragon by not using breath.  Furthermore, all of the benefits of E2 (100% AA, two free breaths, 20% ult refund) are all once per dragon cycle, which incentivizes immediately blowing up the dragon so you can start charging the next one up.",

The E2 could be changed to give 1 or 2 free breaths every time the dragon takes a turn, which would also help stack the new E1 higher.",

RMC's buffs passively apply to the memosprite when the main character has the buff (and vice-versa).  Sunday needs to actively skill/ult while the memosprite is already active to buff it, which obviously doesn't synergize with instant sacrifice.  It's the main reason RMC is currently seen as better.\n\nThere is a world in which this sort of works: You run ~145-150 speed Sunday (just slow enough that Castorice jumps ahead of him with S1, assuming she never falls below 50%).  If Castorice can fully charge her dragon with her next skill before Sunday acts, you can do a two round dragon where Castorice ults before Sunday's turn, gets a few breaths in, then Sunday skills, Castorice heals the dragon with enhanced skill, and you blow up the dragon.  However our current roster of healers won't be able to consistently charge Castorice that fast.  Hyacine may or may not change this, but it's way too early to say.",

So these are some expensive teams. Notably every team except Castorice could be faster by going sustainless (as long as Mydei doesn't go down more than 3 times). \n\nAnaxa (since his performance and longevity is what I'm most worried about)\n\n>!Anaxa's s1, e1, and e2 are team support (which also amplify his own damage), so it makes sense that it they don't increase his personal damage as much in hypercarry. The build could be sweatier with 4pc Genius or a Wind pseudo -1 setup, I guess? But it's not like the other teams  in this showcase are hyper-optimized either.!<\n\n>!But given that Anaxa's ability to actually provide damage amp to Herta is mostly locked behind vertical investment and he's otherwise a hypercarry that's way behind the curve for 3.x, he's just so incredibly skippable as a unit. He has the best Erudition sub-dps performance across encounters for Herta because he's very consistent, but those pulls are so much better spent on Tribbie's e1 or Herta's eidolons. At e2s1, he should pull ahead as the definitive best sub-dps across the board (vs at e0, Jade being situationally stronger vs 5 targets with Debt Collector Tribbie) thanks to offering ok team-wide damage amp in e1 and e2.!<",

And because the dragon instantly attacks, unless you Castorice ult on Sunday's turn you can't really do instant suicide attacks.\n\nOther anti-synergies/pro-RMC synergies: Castorice doesn't have energy so the regen does nothing (to be fair this also affects RMC so it's probably a wash), RMC can heal Mem with her skill points, and RMC's ult and Mem both attack which works well with Gallagher who's already her current BiS.  I think there's some room for synergy with S1 Castorice and ~145-150 speed Sunday where she AAs herself in front of Sunday at the end of the dragon rotation, though how good that actually is idk.",

It only works when the non-boss enemies are easily picked off though, if they're too tanky his damage gets spread too thin.\n\nI think this is the kind of fight where sub-dps Anaxa at the very least is intended to do their best, since once it's just the boss for a rotation or two then Anaxa would help make sure the damage loss is less extreme. I agree though that Hypercarry is best vs either a single enemy or like 2 enemies at a time max as it stands.",
