It's the Battle Pass Weapon after all, and sibce healing isn't that big of a deal so far, and other healing LCs have a bigger impact (QpQ on Gallagher for example, or Signature LCs for 5\u2606s) I doubt many people went out of their way to get 5 copies of that LC, and if you start going for it now then you'll be done in like 4 to 5 patches, depending on if you got the LC in the past at least once or not, and if you do you probably also won't get the Rememberance LC at E5 any time soon.\n\nSo for the time being I suppose quite a lot of people are forced to go to an alternate LC here... or is Shared Feelings even at E1 allready better then What is Real E5 for Gallaghar in a High Max HP Team when it comes to generating Charge for Castorice?\n\nEDIT: Messed up, Shared Feelings isn't the BP LC, my bad",

They require other things (debuff application, FuA, and HP fluctuation respectively) to charge their ults. It isn't counted as energy in the regular sense so er ropes won't work on them because their \"energy\" is conditional. \n\nYou'd think because of that, qpq would naturally not count them as targets for the energy mechanic because they \"don't have energy\". But no. It still targets them, wasting up to 16 energy on a teammate who doesn't and cannot even use it. \n\nI still hate why it's like that. Like come on.",
