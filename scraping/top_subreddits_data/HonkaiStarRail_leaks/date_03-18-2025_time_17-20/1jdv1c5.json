There's one such effect in the upcoming AS (\"After any ally target's HP was consumed, they restore HP equal to\u00a060%\u00a0of the HP consumed. This can restore a maximum of\u00a050%\u00a0HP per turn.\")\u00a0and it allows the dragon to attack 6 times in one turn when it starts at 100% HP. (Look for AS showcases with Cas online, would link one but it won't let me on mobile)\nIf we get a playable character with this consumed HP refund effect then the dragon could attack one or two more times per turn at e0 without killing itself. Considering leaks mentioned Hyacine could be burning HP to heal it could very well be her",

Because future content will be balanced with the understanding that any particular account may have every global buff available, Speed breakpoints could increase because of a speed buff, weakness matching could be done away with by a global weakness implant, SP and energy economy could be turned on it's head by an global passive that increases SP or energy gain. And even if they start relatively tame, they could release characters that globally increase your damage slowly by like 1-2 percent at a time until you NEED a certain number of these chars to clear content. It's just an easily-abusable mechanic that people don't trust hoyo not to abuse yet.",

Look who was right.\"\nTriple banners is objectively a good addition , and sure, it should happen more often, but currently we had one in 2.5, the second in 3.0, and a rumored one for anni in 3.2, if we are going with this with objectivity\u00a0 ,triple banners are getting more frequent.\nAnd since hoyo is greedy, they'll probably add one during Fate collab in 3.4 or so.\nA triple banner every two patches sounds good imo.\n\n\nSo what if i am optimistic? Id say the devs know their game better than you and i and the community,\u00a0 and they're not newbies, they know how gachas work, how these passives are supposed to be. What can break the game is hp inflation, or op kits, not global passives.\nOf course,\u00a0 they can very well fuck up and push the limits, but thats unlikely, and unless phainon gets a busted passive\u00a0 , this global passive fearmongering will remain for me a nothing burger\n\n\nEdit: typo",

Sunday did arguably get worse because damage% is even more overloaded now though.\n\n>the dragon needs to be fully healed before each breath attempt which requires a ridiculous powerful healer\n\nNone of that was a Sunday problem.

Good question\n\nAs for Sparkle, only way for her to buff the dragon is using her skill on it, which has... Some problems too (if Sparkle is slower than 165 her buff only lasting for 1.99 turns will make it so the dragon has the buff one turn, but not the next turn, and if she's faster than 165 her AA is kinda wasted), and unfortunately it can't be fixed even with E6, since they decided to screw her again and make it so the CDam buff for the whole team at E6 doesn't apply to memosprites\n\nEdit: In fact, one of the biggest problems for Sunday with Casto is that, unless the dragon is on field, his ult buff/skill buff won't apply unless you use it again, and they fixed that with RMC E1 (and also Tribbie), both of them don't have that problem",

From a player satisfaction and enjoyment POV, having eidolons that \"fix\" or \"greatly enhance\" a unit's performance will not feel nice and even predatory because it makes us feel like we need to pull something to get the complete package.\n\nBut if you think about it from a game balance perspective, a well tuned kit without eidolons that massively change a unit's performance are actually the most susceptible to being rendered useless by powercreep, and offer the least options for vertical investment.\n\nIt should be clear already that HSR powercreep is NOT going away. As with any other live service game. This is just how the business model works. So giving players less options to combat powercreep by making undertuned or simple damage increase eidolons ends up with scenarios like Jing yuan, seele, or blade, who have no \"game-changing\" eidolons to revive their performance. Instead you need to hyperinvest in supports to drag your favourite units across the finish line.\n\nCompare this to modern day DPS units. Hypothetically, let's say Aglaea in a years time is finding herself unable to tackle the new content due to either hp inflation, boss mechanics, unfavourable buffs, or some combination of those. A player who really likes Aglaea can simply pull E1 and see a >50% improvement damage-wise and comfort-wise. \n\nI also wouldn't quite call E0 Aglaea's kit \"flawed\" in the sense that she's unplayable. As far as the stats are concerned, she's clearing quite fast in all endgame modes, beating even Therta (Source: prydwen)",

Maybe Aglaeas E1 revives her performance  in a year but more likely those pulls are better spent on the next overtuned kit that has one-upped the previous one upped kit. So in a way you can look at the same data and potentially make the opposite argument that a fix eidolon like Aglaea E1 is bad now and not really useful in a year. Also yes I understand Aglaea is clearing content very well right now so maybe not the best example. But in the end the more flat the power spike is among the new characters the longer the dps shelf life and the higher the power of new characters may seem great but it will just mean the pace of power creep will be faster.",

No hope of hoyo slowing down power creep.\n\nAbsolutely no reason not to just assume it going forwards if you're a meta focused player now. Expect Phainon to power creep Castorice.\n\n\"oh but THerta outperforms Cas\" yea yea yea wait until we see Hyacine's kit.\n\n\"but Aglaea has a higher ceiling\" for who, people that are willing to grind out a 158 speed 200 crit Eagle + Lukasha set on Sunday? Are there even 100 of those people per server? For everyone else that plays at whatever the equivalent of KQM standards are for HSR, Castorice is gonna be equivalent to if not marginally better than Aglaea and THerta on release because of shill environment, then get a buff when her DLC healer drops and sprints past the meta.\n\nThis also increases the account value of pulling strong support eidolons and diminishes the value of strong DPS eidolons. f2p meta going forward will just be: pull DPS if you have their supports AND if you can afford their sig, OR if they can use a Herta shop one really well, never vertically invest into DPSes, use remaining pulls on support eidolons. Have one AoE team and one for ST content, and swap them out once a year or so. Maybe consider a 3 team rotation of a 5 target, a 3 target, and a true ST if you win some 50/50s on your support pulls.\n\nAlthough, hoyo might realize that f2p players are catching on to this strategy and do stuff like global passives more often to shake up the f2p meta. Atp it becomes BP+welkin or quit. Is it naive of me to believe that it won't ever get that bad?",

Characters will obviously get stronger so they can sell, but later outdated characters will get buffed, and underperforming newer characters get dedicated supports, random boons (f2p/gacha 4* lc, relic set upgrades), and unique environment opportunities all the time. \n\nIt\u2019s scummy but it\u2019s been fairly satisfying for me as a player who just goes with the flow.

They didn't want \"powercreep\"(let's be fu**ing real here, powercreep would've happened anyway, it would've been shitty of hoyo to keep castorice and anaxa(who also got buffed fortunately) with the V3 state(since before V4 castorice supposedly had a high risk high reward PlayStyle except the reward wasn't high at all. And as you suspected, herta was just better with less risk and anaxa has competitions as of being worth or not(jade already jade 2 banners and a lot of people could've gotten her E1 because it's just that good of an Eidolon on her, and E6 Serval with S5 passkey LC isn't THAT rare so you wouldn't have gained much by getting anaxa(unless in ST situations) for herta, now he is straight up better than his V3 version and while still having great competitions for herta 2nd erudition ally, he is more worth, anyways back to the main point of powercreep would've happened anyway 90%.)\n\nThere are also some other reasons but these are the main ones I thought of\n\nAlso hyacine \"possibly\" (I kinda believe it but I only 100% believe it when I see it) being her BiS means she only gets better and better with more 3.X characters but we have to see how her future DPS rivals will end up.",

V4 is the new V3 ).\nShe needed it anw. The stats on her runs outside of pollux were ridiculous\u201d.\n\nEvery single one of them expected her to get buffs. Even HoS (the one with the 2-cost Kafka run) expected her to get buffs and put her below her peers, and without Hyacine to basically turn everything into the Pollux boss he believed she\u2019d be fine. He legit says \u201cMaybe buff her eids a bit, but I don't mind her v3 if Hyacine can do those things\u201d (read his community posts).\u00a0\n\nSo what if Hyacine either doesn\u2019t \u201cdo those things\u201d or you don\u2019t have her?\n\nThe point I was making is that basing someone like Firefly\u2019s overall strength on a showcase of the trio is legitimately brain dead. If that\u2019s all you have then your meta opinion is worthless because it\u2019s not caveated properly. You don\u2019t know when you can expect that level of performance.\u00a0\n\nYou haven\u2019t actually done any real kit analysis, and it\u2019s why this sub is so dogshit at saying a character\u2019s strength. They just see numbers and cycle length and can\u2019t even make a simple pro/con list. They can\u2019t tell you WHEN a character can do that performance (best you get is that Feixiao is single target, Herta is aoe, and Boothill likes to break. As if anyone actually needs to hear this lol).\n\nJust know that showcase makers and spreadsheet creators (ask the maker of the spreadsheet I posted below what he thought of v3 [hint: it was that she was a scam]) broadly disagree with your assertion.\u00a0\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N8G8zQ4VYNVQBuZb6ZiceW6O3ioTSULxCdlcYEFx8XU/htmlview#",

And if you think Hyancine won't be made for her being the Abundance 5 star of Amphoreus then Idk what to tell you.\n\nAnd I heavily stand by the fact that a lot of testers are skewed and just want their favorite characters to be giga buffed while having no drawbacks on their kits, so taking their words as the absolute truth is dumb. \n\nA proof of that is that one tester that makes those jpegs reviewing the characters saying Mydei was the superior pull when in truth he's a MoC bot, not great in PF and can be easily screwed over in AS depending on the boss gimmick due to his stupid auto-play (which testers tend to overlook a lot), while Castorice is top tier in all 3 modes. So yeah, not worth taking a skewed perspective like that seriously.",

Ie she's bricked without Hyacine (look at the relics for HoS showcases, and map out the rotation likewise MoC buff is always stronger than the character even if solely bc it's like adding a fifth character \\[see the second break bar MoC as clear example\\]). And that was the most positive review. Likewise, Shingetsu's Kitchen is a Herta simp 0-cycler bro. The people with the best showcases are saying still saying her kit has problems. A regular player would obviously struggle way more. It's not surprising they would complain more. \n\n>And I heavily stand by the fact that a lot of testers are skewed and just want their favorite characters to be giga buffed while having no drawbacks on their kits, so taking their words as the absolute truth is dumb.\n\nLol, to be clear I don't need to take anyones word as the absolute truth. That was advice for who don't do their own tc (people who rely on showcases but don't use the opinions of the showcase creators fall here). Someone posted some Castorice calcs (I'll add a link to the post below) and the comment block at the end is my critique of it. \n\nMy advice was for people who either can't or won't understand what I was getting at below with relative ease. This is not a knock on anyone btw. Some people hate this kind of shit, but they should know who they are and adjust the confidence of their meta takes accordingly (this is really the conclusion I'm trying to get at).\n\nContext: I believe their Castorice dragon calc doesn't account for the increasing dmg% per blast correctly. I outlined what they did in the first sentence anyone who's already lost shouldn't have a meta take (ideas/intuition is fine, but match the confidence with the conclusion appropriately. Doom posting is when it doesn't match for example).\n\n>Just looking at the first sheet currently, but are you sure it's correct to have dmg% = Constant (I'll be calling this K) + AVERAGE (0,30,60,90,120)?.\n\n>I don't think the average function works out to the correct answer here because the MVs that each additional damage% are multiplied against are different. Essentially it would be something closer to a weighted average no?\n\n>For example, if we were to do the damage formula for each individual aspect of the dragon blast + swipe (I'll use this for as an example, further assume that the dmg% increases before the blast but in a generalized case it doesn't actually matter) and then simplify it we can set up an equation that looks like the following:\n\n>.24(K + d1)+.28(K+d2)+.34(K+d3)+.4(K+d4) = 1.26(K+d).\n\n>You can then solve that equation for d (d3=d4 in that particular instance), but the d isn't actually an average precisely because the multipliers create a different weight to each blast.\n\n>Is there something wrong with my logic?\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/CastoriceMains\\_/comments/1je4mmw/castorice\\_v4\\_calcs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CastoriceMains_/comments/1je4mmw/castorice_v4_calcs/)",

That + they've been confirmed to have a massive bias against Sunday to the point of slandering his synergy with every unit ever since Aglaea.\n\nNobody cares if a leaker gets something wrong. There's an issue, however, when a leaker does it multiple times intentionally, and spreads misinformation on purpose, even letting their own biases against characters factor in. \n\nImagine this scenario but with doctors. A doctor accidentally misdiagnoses a disease due to misreading symptoms. A bad mistake to make, but it occurs surprisingly often and there was no ill intent. But this guy is like a doctor who purposefully prescribes you the wrong medication 3 times in a row and then hides the fact you have a dangerous genetic disorder that needs to be checked because they hate your sister and want her to suffer without treatment.",

Its definitely pretty noticeable that the enemy mobs got a lot nastier starting from about 2.2 and require pretty specific teams and gearing to get by even in the main story.  \n\nThey were also pretty unhappy about the current MoC too only 2 characters can really take advantage of the buff gimmick and even then its so specifically oriented around Aglaea given her speed and having the element that all the enemies in the Floor 12 Nikador fight have.

No, so with a simular build you could very well get the same cycle as them. But she IS weaker. And it's not like these buffs all of a sudden make her 50% stronger because they don't. Are they nice? Sure, but Mydei is still a little stronger and as a result so are Herta and Aglaea. It's just closer now. Cas's Eidolons are also weaker than both Herta and Aglaea though Mydei has the worst cons of the lot and is surpassed by E1 Cas now. All i am trying to say is these buffs are fine and people should stop complaining.",

Tribbie main benefit is her frequent attack and high HP as a buffer so she can survive longer from all the HP drain gimmick from Castorice and able to utilise someone like Gallagher where he put a mark on enemy and you heal upon hitting the mark. If you not a meta chaser she is not neccesary, RM and Sunday still do amazing despite being somewhat unsynergetic. I was really struggling to decide if I want Tribbie as I got Therta E2 but I also want Castorice and my jade are not exactly abundance enough to guaranteed both if I keep losing the 50/50. Decide to pull her but lost to Welt so yea now Im guaranteed for Castorice and don\u2019t want to risk anything. Also, for Castorice team, your healer will affect more than your buffer since her ult is depending on overheal to charge it to summon her memosprite dragon, Gallagher & Luocha seems to be the better choice for now until a new healer thats is rumoured to be coming out the patch after Castorice & Anaxa.",

I really hope Castorice isn't on track to bust through that ceiling just 2 patches later.!<\n\n>!I'm going to wait until the beta is over, but if the overall consensus ends up being that Castorice is even better than Therta then I'm probably going to cut my losses with this game and move on.
