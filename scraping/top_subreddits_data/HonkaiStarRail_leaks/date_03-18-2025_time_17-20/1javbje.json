They just expect you to *also* watch trailers for more of it, particularly major backstory details as the game mostly focused on information obtained from Phaethon's point of view.",

Sure they put some backstory things, but some of the greatest driving forces behind the characters are locked behind the trailers. Miyabi's biggest story moment in the game so far literally has a brief flashback to a cutscene that's *not even in the game*. Expecting me to also watch trailers when I'm playing a game isn't good storytelling. If I'm playing a game I expect to have all of its story content within the game, not have to engage with whatever other media channels to get the full experience.",

His arc is engaging, his interactions with other characters is believable and enjoyable, his trailer and presence in cutscenes is insanely dominant...\n\n...and then you get him in battle, and he just spends the entire battle punching the floor with some magical astrology crystals and you don't even get to control him. \n\nHe doesn't even look like he's the Demigod of Strife. You don't see the Lance of Fury. You don't see him summoning spears and weapons and shit. You don't hear that \"bloodlust\" sound that Nikador made us hear when we approached him in the story.\n\nI am so fucking pissed they put so little effort into making the actual game part of Mydei even half as much a success as his character. He's by far my favourite character in the entire game by a wide margin and I won't even be pulling for him I'm that disappointed.",

If you removed that entire aventurine story, pretty much nothing changes. The pay off for the set up its theoretically doing is too far off for the amount of time it took and we don't even know if it will ever happen since the original penacony story is over. It wasn't really noticeable then bc there was still an opportunity for it to pay off and it's a mystery, but it kinda just didnt. Mydei doesn't have that problem, there's very little mystery, set up, or loose threads to pay off. He did his story quest and fucked off the kremnoa to fight the black tide. He doesn't even need another story appearance to justify his story relevance, he already changed the direction of the plot, the motivation of key characters, etc. So long he appears a few times (especially when we finally beat up the big bad), his story is already as complete as it has to be (though ofc I would love more mydei plots to open up.)",
