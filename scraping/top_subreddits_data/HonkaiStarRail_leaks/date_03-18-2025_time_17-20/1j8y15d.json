                                    "body": "As far as I'm aware, this is a contentious topic even within disabled communities, and the actual answer is that different people seek different things in media, and that there's no real unifying experience that will universally make everyone like things one way.  Some people want more realism and to feel like their struggles are heard, and/or being transmitted to other people, and others want the power fantasy and the imaginary world where people can fully conquer them.  I've especially heard this come up a lot in tabletop rpg, where you get a lot of stories of someone whose DM or playgroup wants to impose more penalties on them and/or won't let them use magical implements to cover their disability if they really want their character to have it.\n\nI'm not going to speak for any people with real/serious disabilities, this is debate I've seen between them a few times, but I can't say what's more common of a preference or anything, or how many people ultimately enjoy both.  \n\nBut being queer and hearing a lot of queer discourse, I can touch on some vaguely analogous topics (Which, seriously, don't expect it to be that analogous).  A lot of people dislike media that takes place in the real world but without the stigma represented because it isn't realistic, while many others may enjoy it for various reasons, such as A. Finally feeling like there is media like the media they saw growing up, but with people like them in it. B. Seeing realistic stigma being triggering.  C. It feeling homogenous and like it can take over that character's allotted narrative if they have to spend some of it coping D. Feeling like it is self-reinforcing the current reality and making people think there is no other way.  This is even more different, but it's still about how being in a group doesn't necessarily make you only approve of some types of representation: there's also the model minority problem - some realistic things to portray are deeply problematic.  And while we can show toxic or problematic or even just weird relationships and behaviors about hetero characters in media as a matter of course, a lot of queer people are deeply uncomfortable with the idea of showing queer ones.  They don't want to encourage it, it may be triggering, they feel like they may be affected by it, they may fear the rest of society's image of the entire minority being tainted by it and treating them worse/differently.  When representation is hard to come by in general, a singular off-kilter example can, in the public's mind, color that entire group uncomfortably easily.  \n\nFrankly, power fantasy writing, and even idealistic writing, either as an all-encompassing aspect of a work, or as one tool utilized in it, are already contentious as is.  They are widely already considered bad writing in a lot of circles.  However, both are popular.  Regardless of literary criticism, academia, etc.  There will always be people who want to imagine a world where people can trivialize all of their problems.  There will always be people who want, from media, the best future imaginable, rather than one bogged down by the complications and struggles of reality.  And people who want to see both, of course.\n\nIf the point of representation is to depict things accurately in media, then yeah it defeats the point to have a character with a disability and for it not to matter.\n\nIf the point of representation is to make people feel represented in media, then there's a LOT of room for things to be contentious because its what some people in that group want to see, while it's not what others want to see.  Because people's feelings are complicated and incredibly diverse.\n\nI think there's a natural tension because of a writer's prerogative to make any information provided matter, and serve a purpose in the narrative.  But that's not necessarily how people consume it.  There's a part of the audience that will go, 'If everyone else can be a superhero and break the bounds of what they can feasibly do, why not someone like me?'  There's a part of the audience that just would like to see someone who looks like them there but not make the narrative about it.",
