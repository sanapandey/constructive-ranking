Dhil shouldn't be as bad 2nd side either but bc you have Jing it's quite easy to recommend him for the tv's 2nd side, though mini herta and serval are insanely good at taking care of them too despite being 4* chars, I assume you have RMC unlocked as well which should be insanely helpful for your 2nd side or whichever one you're not running Sunday/Robin on, you can also do some fun rotations with Ratio+March 7th hunt or Moze in 1st half as well but mainly March since Moze can be inconsistent against the dice bc of his disappearing from field meanwhile the dice get wiped very quickly so.. as you can imagine he's just not that good here. Another carry I've seen be amazing 1st half is Seele who's a 1.0 char but bc you didn't mention her I assume you don't have her (me neither I pulled Jing instead of her in 1.0)\n\nThe main issue here is unironically that all the carries you mentioned benefit from Sunday but bc you're playing Jing then Sunday is bound to be glued there so your Blade, Ratio and Dhil can end up suffering quite a lot, a rotation I can imagine is Ratio, March 7th, Pela, Robin/Tingyun 1st half and then Jing(or Dhil), Sunday, Tingyun/Robin, flex slot (potentially RMC) 2nd half; Blade's issue is that he will still want to take Sunday, RMC and Tribbie if you have her as well from your other team, otherwise you won't be doing much with him there",

I managed an unoptimized ~3300 first half with E0S1 Ratio + E0S1 Robin + E6S5 Pearls Pela + E6S5 Breakfast small Herta using the damage reduction buff. If you have S1 Aven, I was able to get a comfier clear replacing Pela with E0S1 Aven and using the FuA buff. I overcapped on Robin's energy semi-consistently on both teams, so I don't think her LC is necessary to achieve similar results.\n\nI got a pretty consistent 3500-3600 second half with E0S1 base SPD JY + E0S1 136 SPD Sunday + E2S1 134 SPD Bronya + E6S5 Herta shop LC Remembrance TB using the CD buff. Bronya's E2 is not useful in this team, and her E1 and S1 are unnecessary if Sunday has his LC. DDD would probably perform better on her.\n\nSome notes:\n\n* Some other commenters have suggested Hunt March against Aventurine. Personally, I found that she struggles with Ratio against that half, as Aventurine **stops summoning dice once you've beaten his game** in phase 1. Therefore, killing dice only gets you a little over halfway through his toughness bar. Because neither Ratio nor March matches Aventurine's weaknesses, this walls them for a good chunk of AV.\n\n* **I strongly suggest using Robin on your non-JY team.** JY has other options that perform about as well; Robin hard-carries your first team's damage, and well-timed ults can save your team if you're running sustainless.\n* At certain points during the Aventurine fight, he will activate some of the dice. Killing all of the activated dice will **regen one character's energy (phase 1) or everyone's energy (phase 2)**. You can let him activate the dice on purpose to try to funnel Robin energy, if you're having energy problems.\n\n* While it's not at all necessary for a good 2nd half score, I found that Mem's ult required little maintenance in my setup to pull JY before Sunday for a Mem -> JY -> Sunday -> JY -> LL -> Bronya -> Sunday -> JY -> LL combo. If you have a -1 SPD JY-Sunday setup, this doesn't matter for you.\n\n* I didn't change my usual builds, so several of my characters are using limited LCs. The only one that I think makes a difference is Sunday's -- you need either his LC or lucky E1S1 Bronya procs for comfy team 2 SP management. The others should be covered by the 200-300 AV wiggle room for a 6600 full clear.",

Unfortunately, I forgot who said that\n\nI don't know about Blade at all, forgive me. But if Blade can clear current MoC with just his E1 or E2 + Three 4 Star Character as his support, maybe the rate of powercreep of HSR is almost the same as Genshin.
