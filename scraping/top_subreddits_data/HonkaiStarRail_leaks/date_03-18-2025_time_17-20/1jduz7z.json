The thing with Anaxa is if you're looking at quantum you have to compare it to the scholar set that was made for him. It's hard to beat 20% damage buff to skill and Ult with 8% Crit when that's already basically everything he wants. \nSo what u discovered in the calcs:\n\nEOSO Scholar was better. \n\nE1S1 Scholar was still better.\n\nEOSO with Pela(resolution shines) quantum was better offering in the ballpark of a 40% damage increase from the 20% quantum defense shred because your getting 95-99% shred depending on your resolution shines superimpose. \n\nE1S1 or E0S1 or E1SO with Pela(resolution shines) scholar was better because in any of these scenarios your just over capping a lot of defense shred. Of course you could remove resolution shines to make up for E1 or S1. \n\nI'm guessing not much changes with the 7% other than he's now even better with scholar cause he's just getting more defense shred with it. Whereas quantum is still only going to be worth it while using Pela so now your just going to overlap defense shred even more. I could be wrong though. \n\nSo yeah I'd say either go with your high speed wind set up especially if your trying for a sustain Anaxa. Or go scholar for general purposes.",

I just love the variety. \n\nI double checked to make sure with the extra 7%. So at E1S1 with quantum not considering other character factors, the quantum set will give around a 25% damage increase. So thats roughly on par with scholar since it  20% plus Crit plus an extra 25% some of the time.\n\neES1 quantum plus E1 Ruan Mei I think gets you 95% defense shred so that would be very worth it. That's getting  you close to 40% damage buff from the extra 20% on quantum.",

If he is only truly shining in Therta teams but isnt even best in slot there then it would be such a waste of his character and design.\n\nTruth is People dont want to many buffs that force him into Therta teams while also dont want to many nerfs becouse in terms of other dps/sub dps options he is on the lower end of the spectrum\n\nregardless i will pull for him",

A character that can sub dps/ dps, someone who has utility. They clearly have it in his kit an they buffed only the part of his passive that helps dual carry teams in a Herta team he gets 80% Crit and the 40% DMG buff sure 140% CritDMG is a lot but he isnt loosing out on to much but gains the insane dmg output of Herta, which may not raise his dmg but raises the overall dmg output from the team. Next Since the Hertas CritDMG buff is team wide supports like bronya sunday Sparkle RMC also gain even more buffing capabilitys. \n\nIn sense Anaxa and Herta are buffers for themselves in this Team and right now all his Solo Carry Teams i have seen  look Mid.\nAnd the Sustainless Argument is also invalid. I have seen sustainless Seele  0 and 1 Cycles that doesnt make Seele  the best dps. \nALMOST ALL DPS CHARACTER CAN GO SUSTAINLESS RIGHT NOW THATS JUST HOW BROKEN THE HARMONY UNITS AND DMG CELLINGS ARE RIGHT NOW. \n\nIts nothing special at a certain investment all can do that.\n\n\n And to speculate about an end of the AOE Meta anytime soon and him beeing better than the herta by then is cope\nIf that meta shift where to come both of them could already be powercreept \n\nI get that he isnt a Jiaoqiu but if they arent carefull with how they balance his kit (Like the previous beta versions where they nerfed his personal dmg) he could end up as half assed character and that is Something no one wants\nBecouse he is pretty and i will pull for him for that reason alone already.",

When DHIL was new, I was stuck with a terrible build for months due to bad luck, but he still destroyed everything with no effort, because the content favored him. He only started feeling weaker when 3.0 hit, and content started shilling Acheron instead. You also have to consider that a character can be powercrept even before you finish building them properly, like it happened go my Blade, and at that point, is it worth it to keep improving them? No matter how awesome my Blade's build is, he still sucks.\n\nIf we are talking about my idea of using them as tools, it would be to pull the strongest, give them the best choice you have that you can afford, exploit them as long as they can pull it off with the best build you manage to get, and then replace them. If you get, for instance, TheHerta and Castorice, with their one best support, they should pull through easily until the end of the 3.X cycle even if they are not perfect. At that point, they can safely be discarded and replaced, and it would be cheaper than trying to keep them afloat. I'm more iffy about someone like Phainon. While I'm sure he'll be very strong, he is releasing a little too late in the patch cycle for my tastes, meaning the meta will change in 4.X, and he might get left behind faster.\n\nBut people can do whatever they want with their jades, of course. I mean, there are whales who get everyone to E6, which is severely not needed. But I'm f2p and broke, so vertical investment is simply not an option.

I certainly didn't. I use the same characters you do, you know? I use March, and I use mini-Herta as well, and they are absolutely meta, especially in their own niche. Gallagher is often the BiS in many teams as well. What's your point here? lol\n\nAnd I absolutely remain of my opinion: vertical investment is inefficient, because new characters are better (often massively better) and it's less expensive to just get a new one rather than force an old one to remain relevant. If someone loves their Acheron so much that they can't let go of her, and are willing to invest their body and soul into using her for another year... well, good for them. I commend their loyalty. But for someone like me who is broke and constantly forced to chase meta to have comfortable runs (so not being forced to reset 1000 times to get the perfect setup and rng so that my Hunt March + Mini-Herta with E0S0 supports can kill Nikador in time), efficiency matters. It's really that simple.",

Changing that WILL instantly kill their games.\n\n\"Also, some people like\u00a0*winning*\" let me be real with you. you win NOTHING in this game and the game goes actively AGAINTS it often if you define it as 3star Moc 12...  \nMoc 12 was made for the higher investment people at like E1S1 level or up, to begin with as those people found only floor 10 too easy to curb stomp back then.\n\nYour point at the start is funny cause i am a casual but also play all endgame content fine with mostly missing floor 12 of Moc which is cause as i said its a specific playground and i don't pull E1's or S1's pretty much at all.  \nIts also not a hard to do or anything like that.\n\nLastly the way you type makes it seem that personal enjoyment of winning is the big deal but that should just be kept to yourself and not used as a thing to be factual of \"efficiency\" when pulling a new 5 star just for floor 12 factually is a bad return in investment to begin with.(960 jades a year is what you get from that for using constantly around 28\u00a0800 at worst to get one five star.)",

It's absolutely balanced with E0 in mind. Specifically, for newer-ish E0S0 characters, as long as they use synergistic team comps. Right now, it's balanced around TheHerta and Aglaea, so it's easy for them, doable with proper setups with 2.X characters, and very hard for 1.X characters (except for Jing Yuan, who somehow can't stop winning). Same for the other 2 modes. Everything that comes before the last floor is also so piss easy that it's not fun at all. MoC 11 is okay for casuals. But, for an invested player, this means that the \"95% of the game\" you mentioned is *a drag*. To me, it's as satisfying as farming calixes, and I feel no pride and no joy in \"being able to beat it\". Nor do I consider it a satisfying way to use my characters. And this applies to most endgame focused players.\n\nYou don't win anything by playing videogames in general, but we do it anyway, do we? I don't spend in the game, because I'm piss poor, so efficiency becomes the most important thing if I want to enjoy endgame. And it's a *mathematical fact* that trying to keep an older character afloat meta-wise is more expensive (and hence inefficient) in the long run. If the game were balanced differently (like in Genshin, for instance), Eidolons would actually be the most efficient choice, since they guarantee your character will be strong until basically EoS. But this is not the case in HSR due to powercreep. So if someone tells me that getting E2 Acheron was an efficient choice... well, it's not. It's a choice they made out of love, and I'm glad it works for them. But it's not efficient pull-wise, just like it's not efficient to get a dps on their rerun.",

Evelyn is only competitive w/ Miyabi if you can play her and utilize all her tech (vs button mashing on Miyabi), SAnby (a fan favourite character and the mascot of the game btw) is worse than Miyabi, and Hugo is looking to fall somewhere around SAnby, maybe even a bit behind her.\n\nMiyabi being broken, and therefore fucking annihiling not only Ice DPS characters, but ALL DPS characters, was a given.\n\nCompare this to DHIL, who people spoke as if it were new heights, then JL, who rivaled or pushed ahead of DHIL at E0, then into Acheron, who was a huge step up from those two, into FF, then into (Rappa) Feixiao. The fact that the only true casualty of ZZZ is Ellen (who I'm pretty sure had issues all the way back in 1.0) and everyone more or less sits around T0.5 is a win to me, at least until we have more units to work with.\n\nAnd I'm not saying powercreep will never come, btw. It'll always exist, but it really depends on how frequent it is and how bad it is. Again, everyone and their mom could see as far back as 1.0 that Miyabi was going to be a broken unit. These units just exist in gacha, whether we like it or not. And that's fine, as long as it's just those units and not those units and then every subsequent mfer there is. \n\nEDIT: Also, it's only easier to powercreep ZZZ if they opt to go the way of HI3rd. Powercreep is way easier in turn-based things than action-oriented games due to there just being a lot more skill expression in something like ZZZ to pull units back into the spotlight. In a turn-based game as simplistic as HSR, where we effectively have 2 buttons per turn w/ the occasional ult, at some point, MHY likely felt the need to sell XYZ until w/ numbers vs creativity. Unless you're doing no sustain zero cycles, there isn't much in the way of nail-biting skill expression here. Most units have gameplay that amounts to \"spam basic on turn\" or \"spam skill on turn\".",

If they kept endgame steady for 6 months or whatever then people would have been able to build teams based on other factors, simply from having favorite characters or playstyles. But the pressure is what causes people to feel like getting \"powercreep\" units to keep up. And if you invest in a unit that is mediocre to start with instead of just waiting for the next big powercreep unit then you're falling behind. \n\nThere are gachas that have a much slower rate of powercreep and more even balancing across the board. Hell you need not look beyond hoyo to find that Genshin for instance has been known to be rather flat for years compared to the trash cycle the HSR devs inflicted on everyone. Blaming the consumer is placing the blame in the wrong place.",

You don't have to look further than Genshin to see that. Xingling and Bennet, four stars that were there since launch, are meta, everyone has them, and yet limited five stars still sell.\n\nI know it's not a 1:1 comparison because character kits are much more limited in HSR than in Genshin, considering HSR is turn based, but there's no reason HSR should have *this* much powercreep.\n\nThe thing about doomposting is (as someone who was asking for Anaxa to be buffed before v4) -- I'd have no issue with my favorite characters being average and having mid kits if that weren't a death sentence in endgame. But it is, because I know Hoyo won't stop the powercreep and HP inflation once and for all by making Anaxa (or any one unit) mid, it just means that said unit will be left behind. If I trusted Hoyo to plateau the powercreep for good (or slow down enough that an average-on-release unit had a shelf life of more than a mere few patches), I wouldn't mind my favorites being average. I just don't want them to stay behind while other units get exponentially more broken. We need consistency.",

If you use his signature lc (+ ~~6%~~ 12%) and quantum set (+20%) that's a total of ~~54%~~ 60% def ignore. That doesn't even consider other ways you can get def ignore (or def pen) from teammates too!\n\n\nLike if Hylisens is a good DoT applier, you could even pair them together and have Anaxa use the Prisoner set for +6-18% def ignore and 12% attack for instance. Or just use Black Swan (who can also use the Penacony 2 set to boost Anaxa's wind damage) while using Prisoner.\n\n\nHis def ignore not being tied into certain attacks or is highly conditional(lower stacks still grants def ignore at lower amounts vs not activating entirely) is a huge bonus. It's on his base kit and frankly if it's something you care about he can use any of the 3 relic sets with def ignore and can drop his signature for the event LC with no problems.\n\n\nFor comparison, other characters with self defense ignore:\u00a0\n* Black Swan - Talent (20% at 7 stacks if arcana)\n* Boothill - E1 (16%)\n* Firefly - E1(15%)\n* Ruan Mei - E1 (20% def ignore when field is active for all)\n* Rappa - E1 (15% in post ult state)\n\n\n+ a handful of others but they're all E2 or higher.\n\n\nWith their signature, Ratio (for followup), Fei Xiao (for ultimate), JingLiu (at 3 stacks), Jade (for ult+followup after a BA), Boothill (for break damage), and Black Swan (for DoT damage via Prophet stacks- only can get full 4 stacks with attacks against enemies afflicted with all 4 DoT types) have def ignore... but as you can see they're all more conditional (and requires getting the lightcone).\n\n\nOnly Black Swan exceeds this level of def ignore (with base kit + lc) while Jade and Ratio/Fei Xiao (on specific relics) come close to Anaxa. Def ignore scales well too by stacking it.\n\n\nI dunno just seems like a trace people are sleeping on is all!",
