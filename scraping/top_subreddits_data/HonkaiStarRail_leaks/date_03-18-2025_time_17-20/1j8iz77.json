So she has infinite team slot efficiency - this is, in one sense, power creeping the entire roster.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe bigger problem is the precedent it sets by being fundamentally different from any prior character. In the future, if this is well-received, Hoyo will add more impactful gobal passives. If the designated wife character of the next planet Sneedette gives you +10% crit damage for pulling her, then your account is meaningfully worse if you skip her.\u00a0\n\n\nThe cumulative effect is will also cook the game over time, because Castle Orice and Sneedette will both be powercrept hard by the time 5.0 drops, so new players will eventually have to choose between pulling antiquated characters who to get the gobal passives, or dealing with strickly inferior versions of the current best characters.\u00a0",

Turn base games ain\u2019t for everyone, so Castorice could be a key for them to want to play more. There are also the bad players like me. I\u2019m on MoC 12 second half and die with the boss at 23%. Castorice would have saved that run. \n\nWould I have cared that she did so? Not really, I just wanted the jades and to dip out. There is the indifferent players that don\u2019t care if this is in the game or not. Those are the players that will have to decide if a global passive is the make or break for them. Do they take a stand and skip her or just brush it off and summon her because she is cute?\n\nYou gotta make your own decisions when she comes out, you ready to toss in the towel over Castorice and move to a new game? Or you just going to keep playing and hope things don\u2019t get worst? \n\nFor me, I personally don\u2019t care and will be getting the characters I like in the story.

They aren't just going to release a boss that 1 shots 1 of your unit as a one off. They aren't stupid.\n\nAs of now, healers are working damn well , to the point if you have aventurine, ling sha or fuxuan , even gallaghar , you won't be getting one shotted unless u misplay.\n\nFor the precedence it might set,  I don't know the future , but let's not assume it's gonna be 100 percent cr to whole team while not on field, that's a bad way to do business for a gacha game. It's most likely gonna be so minor it doesn't affect much.\n\nGame is PVE, so what if I miss out on like 1 to 5 percent of crit rate , big deal? I will still clear content that I've cleared.

While I do agree that casuals aren't always stupid, and that some of them can definitely understand the precedent this sets, as a day 1 player that finished all endgame contents I can assure you I know at least 6 casuals that do everything in auto mode, doesn't even bother learning about mechanics and even complains about story battle being too hard. And when I spoke to one of them saying that auto isn't really good apart from dailies and events maybe, I got replied \"who played this game manually to begin with?\"\nSee, these people won't care about this passive. They'll be happy if anything, because it will allow them to play even more braindead. Since they don't do endgames, they don't care about how much moc is gonna be insufferable, or AS bosses will have oneshot mechanics, or whatever really. They'll be happy because they can now play easily.\nAnd tbh? I feel that's the kind of players that Hoyo wanted to cater to with both Mydei (that you can't control) and Castorice. Big numbers, braindead, global passive.\u00a0\nTldr; not all casuals for sure, but definitely a good 90% of them\u00a0",

You just have to go through menus to access MoC in the official game. \n\nThe reason why you don\u2019t do that in the beta is because the code (i.e. the menu functionality) for MoC isn\u2019t included in the beta. It would be extremely tedious if you had to download a full 2nd copy of the game to test a few new things. The beta is basically is stripped down version of the full game, only including the basic functions you need to test the characters and mechanics.\n\nTo go into more detail about the battles, each enemy, each calyx, any way you can possibly start a battle, have a unique preset battle. If you\u2019re familiar with object-oriented programming, you can think of each battle as an object. Every enemy and mode have their own battle object. You can see this in the official game when you fight a specific overworld enemy. They always come with the same additional enemies. The fight will always be the same. In the beta, you are basically setting every enemy, calyx, etc to hold the preset battle you configured. That\u2019s why no matter how you enter battle, you will always fight who you wanted.\n\nYou can access the battle from any enemy, any calyx, any cavern of corrosion, stagnant shadow, etc etc. Any way you can enter battle that\u2019s supported in the beta will enter you into the battle you configured. There is no special MoC code that they\u2019ve kept hidden away from the beta.\n\nHowever, you\u2019re correct in that we shouldn\u2019t take it for 100% certain just yet. They could easily change the functionality and remove it from the endgames at any time. We\u2019ll only know for sure until they show it in the livestream.",

Castorice's global passive is not that good, revive mechanics in general just don't matter that much for this game, because if the enemies can kill you once, most of the time they're going to be able to do it again. The problem is that they will inevitably take it further and do global passives that are actually good, making certain characters essentially must-pulls. Plus, they're going to be biased about which characters get them. Like, if this was happening in 2.X, Acheron, Firefly, and Sunday absolutely would have gotten one, while Feixiao, Boothill, and Rappa probably wouldn't have. It's going to be another way for Mihoyo to market their favorites and leave other characters even further in the dust.",

I really think it's decent.\u00a0 Although I really don't know if I explained myself well, in short, they shouldn't be infinite buffs for each new promotional item they release but limited by team in use or that its simply a normal passive where you require having that unit in the team",

I\u2019m not going into this game expecting to get all the characters just the ones I like. \n\nI\u2019ll skip the units and make sure to get the ones I really want. If I miss a super broken passive? Oh well that sucks, I can either try on a rerun or wait for something more interesting to come out.  I didn\u2019t have Gilgamesh on Fate GO for six years, and got him off a GSSR finally. My account shocker still got everything done without him.\n\nArknights I\u2019m missing Reed Alter one of the best healers in the game, she is on like every squad but I\u2019m still chillin without her. Azur Lane I\u2019ve missed tons of URs that have broken passives, but I\u2019m still playing the game.\n\nNow on ZZZ, I missed Burnice last rate up but going for her now. I don\u2019t care if she isn\u2019t the best pick anymore, I\u2019m just getting what I like.",

The game will gain new players from the anniversary and Fate collab will have tons of more people coming over. The only players it\u2019s going to lose it people that quit from this. \n\nHowever, I highly doubt even 75% of these players talking about this Castorice passive will quit. Because why wouldn\u2019t they have quit by now? We know Castorice is coming out like this, so they could just quit and try a different game. Or they just keep playing HSR because they like it.",

Bailu already has a revive, and any damage that bypasses shields makes 1 HP worthless if not running a healer.\n\nBut again, fuck this precedence, I hope they change it because it's an awful thing to allow in the game.",

Take Acheron; she released a year ago with a never-seen-before technique that allowed players to bypass an entire aspect of the game (mob fights, especially in the Simulated Universe). Did Hoyo get greedy and powercreep this ability with even more ridiculous abilities? No, they didn't. On the contrary, they replaced Simulated Universe with Divergent Universe where the number of mob fights was drastically reduced, making Acheron's technique almost superfluous.\n\nBy the looks of it, Castorice is intended to be the Acheron of 3.X hence Hoyo's wish to give her a unique ability, something that sounds cool, something very flavorful and on theme considering the character's design and her role in the story. So if anything, based off Hoyo's own track record, I think there's a bigger chance they introduce a new mechanic that makes Castorice's revive irrelevant later than them powercreeping her with even more insane global passives.\n\nJust my opinion though, maybe I'm too naive. Right now I don't see why I should worry about hypothetical issues. There's enough negativity in the community already.",
