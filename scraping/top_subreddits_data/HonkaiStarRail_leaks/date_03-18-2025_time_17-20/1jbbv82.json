Then, over the weekend, I saw someone post a small riddle in the forum, so I decrypted it for everyone. However, yesterday morning I received different information, and I decided to share the news that there might have been changes.\n\nSo, it's reasonable to speculate: the changes to **Castorice** likely happened around the weekend. The information I initially received was probably the same as what other insiders had, but after adjustments were made, their information might not have been updated in time (to be honest, how many people actually believed me when I posted about the possible changes yesterday? It's kind of amusing).\n\nToday, it seems like there are voices in various forums calling for a reckoning against the insiders. I find this really ironic. Someone is willing to take risks to share some ahead-of-time information with you, and instead of being grateful for the countless times they've provided accurate information, you're angry because one piece of information they shared was incorrect. How is this any different from the \"contribution\u6e05\u96f6\u8bba\" (the theory of erasing contributions)? No one can be 100% accurate, but isn't it better to follow these leaks than to dwell on \u6784\u53f2 (constructed history, aka fake leak/information)?\n\nThis also applies to previous insiders like **Uncle HellGirl** and **Uncle 097**. They were happy to share information with others, but some people didn't appreciate it and instead used \u7279\u6b8a\u6b66\u5668 (special weapons) against them, forcing them to leave the forum. As the saying goes: \"\u8d34\u5427\u6ca1\u6709\u8205\u8205\u662f8u\u4eec\u5e94\u5f97\u7684\" (The forum deserves to have no insiders). (Here, I invite any capable insiders to join our Team Command. No one will\u6e05\u7b97 (reckon with) you here, and you can exchange information with us. They can even provide accounts.)>!&#x200B;!<",

Like I was wondering why they were obsessed with her since there was nothing to latch onto other then her nice dress. I dont hate her or love her, shes just present. Now 3.1 made her a little more interesting and maybe 3.2 might make her really cool but so far shes just seems like an OK person. So I wonder what Hoyo is cooking if they are pushing her so hard before 3.2",

Plus she was SAM, and the SH had been built up as a huge plot important faction literally from the prologue. So I think some people were hype. Re Cas, she was getting hyped by Hoyo p much out of nowhere lol. I didn\u2019t even see that many people excited for her (or even disliking her mind) from the 2.7 stream. So it feels like they\u2019re artificially trying to make FF 2.0 to some people\u2026again I\u2019m rlly not trying to cause discourse, I like FF and Cas both actually, I\u2019m just saying why it feels artificial to some people!<",

At least Aglaea is taking full advantage of Sunday's kit.\n\nPersonally I guess Castorice will be good, but she won't be the prime character of 3.x and not the perfect match for Sunday. There are more Remembrance characters coming and I guess one of those will be the pinnacle Remembrance Carry with perfect Sunday synnergy.\n\nCastorice on the other hand will be the fuel for teams using HP as resource. We had this with Jingliu a bit but with Castorice the whole team's HP moves up and down quite fast and this adds to more mechanics with constant healing. And this is good because for now the best sustains have been Fu Xuan and Aventurine with dmg mitigation and shield whereas healing has been ok for endgame but was less useful.",

It's essentially a slight numerical advantage for tribbie (if you factor in her extra damage and fua) vs break efficiency+enemy delay. So it kinda depends on what youre doing.\n\n>DDD spam\n\nDDD is a lightcone, not a character. A lightcone far more rare and expensive (and rng based) than even limited LCs. Doesnt factor in. Its kinda like saying my e1s1 RM is better than e0s0 tribbie. Its extra investment.\n\n>She's decent for non break teams but if you have the other options you're trolling using her over them for those teams lol.\n\nYou dont get how she is used then. You dont use RM instead of robin or instead of sunday (unless you dont have either). You use both. RM has the upside of turning every team into a sustainless team because she (and robin to a degree) is a support and a sustain character at the same time. You cant do this with tribbie. Tribbie is just a straight up damage increase that doesnt provide survivability. \n\n>This isn't 1.x where to survive to need her extra break delay killing them quicker is the best no sustain strat lol.\n\nNot really. Its the opposite. Enemies get tankier and hit harder than they used to. Unless you want to constantly reset for pointless 0-cycles, having RM as your sustain is actually just way better and more consistent. You dont need to fiddle with anything else. You just put her into your team instead of your sustain and youre done.\n\nDoes Robin+sunday+RMC deal more damage than Robin+sunday+RM? Probably, even though not by much. But its also way less consistent.\n\nAnd keep in mind you dont have an infinite amount of supports. Which loops back to what I said initially. You underestimate RM simply because she goes into your break team because she is insanely strong in break - and unique. Most people never try her in anything else because why would they break up their break team? But if you have a RM lying around and dont need her for break she is excellent.",

He is also unlikeable for saying cringe shit like \"I'm going to be the bad guy...\" When discussing Castorice's kit in the beginning.\n\nBut above all else, he has a very good track record of being right about things. I mean we just saw recently that he got the v3 changes and white day art correct, but people still want to say he's unreliable with no evidence to back it up other than \"I remember\" and \"I saw\". It's an echo chamber. \n\nI dislike the guy for the way he acts, but when he leaks information people I have to respect that he's right. I can't actually see any example of him getting something wrong (but every leaker is wrong eventually)",

It's the same amount of damage amp for every character, including Anaxa, and doesnt change based on what or how many weaknesses the enemy currently has implanted by Anaxa.\n\nAnd this is because weaknesses implanted by Anaxa are nothing but badges he tacks onto the enemies' health bar to activate other parts of his kit. Since he does nothing about enemy resistances, this is functionally no different from him applying a functionless debuff counter to them, because he'll still only perform at his best vs wind weak enemies and the same goes for whoever he is the subdps for if you run him like that.

                            "body": "Okay, first of all... yeah. You're right on the fact that Serval + Tribbie makes for a better team than Anaxa + RMC. The main thing is that some people are saying Serval + Tribbie or Jade + Tribbie + Lingsha makes for a *better* team than Anaxa + Tribbie for The Herta, which I think is *probably* untrue. Not sure on the Jade + Tribbie + Lingsha, but that team has an extra limited character in it, so it does inherently have an advantage there. Really difficult to argue between these two teams when there has not really been much hands-on experience with these characters outside of people with access to the betas.\n\nBut for the second argument... no! Anaxa works as a really good Debt Collector for Jade, with the only character on a similar level being Lingsha. Only reason I'm inclined to say Lingsha would be better is because Lingsha attacks at a similar rate but also heals, so you don't need a sustain and can run another support, but I don't think that constitutes as a \"much worse downgrade.\" At worse, I'd say he's either slightly worse or a side grade, but he could turn out to be better than Lingsha for a Debt Collector. And for Hypercarry, the benefit for Anaxa being a \"jack of all trades\" is that, while he might be pretty bad outside of those specific scenarios, when you aren't in those specific scenarios, you just run him as a Sub-DPS.",

Maybe he was too strong with acheron. Maybe they just felt he would sell better as an option for herta but never really built him for that.\n\nBecause the thing is, he is pointless for herta. You assume with no basis that he is supposed to be the best sub-DPS for herta, but he is not. Herta absolutely does not need him, which then according to common sense implies that he was probably not created with her in mind.\n\nEither way it would be super disappointing if they actually made him BiS for herta and suck everywhere else. That would be an actual waste of a character. Right now you can put him in with herta, but you can also play him as a solo-dps or even in a break team. Its kinda cool. I think they just need to improve his ult and traces and he is good to go. Does not need a change in direction.",

I honestly thought that since people were going to pull for her just because \"dragon\" and \"death waifu\", the dev had less incentive to make her broken ?\n\n\nLike tHerta is an emanator and a character present in the game since the beginning, so there would have been bigger backlash if she was mid I think.",

They are counterintuitive as hell since she wants to have the dragon on the field (since it has 3 turns), the extra damage from the 2 turns with breaths are definitely better than 20% ult back and some extra damage. The problem comes when you HAVE TO either: not do anything for the first 2 turns, wasting damage. Or exploding the dragon instantly, which also wastes 2 turns worth of breath damage because the ardent will stacks don't carry over. If her E2 gives 2 ardent will for every turn of the dragon, that'd make it a bit more in line with other DPS E2.",

How long ago did she come out? Was there even a single patch in which rappa did not get to blow up stuff on at least one side of the content?\n\nThe same will happen here. We know already herta obliterates this shadow guy who will be prominent in MoC and AS content from now on. And all of the other stuff she already destroys will keep getting re-used anyway. If MoC and AS only had one side, sure, I would agree with you. But since its two sides the chances that both have no good boss for her to fight become very slim. \n\nAgain, rappa came out like half a year ago I think? Still not a single patch where she didnt work. Herta will be similar - just even easier because hertas powerlevel is even higher. They would really have to go out of their way and craft content that she sucks in...but seeing as both mydei and castiron like aoe-content thats just not going to happen.",

That just pulling these characters strengthens your entire account. That until they HAVE proven that the powercreep (or more accurately the inflation of enemy numbers to keep up with powercreep) is going to slow enough, hoyo can't be trusted to not abuse global passives to provide important buffs in perpetuity. If another char gets a speed global, then enemy speed could be globally increased to match and then everyone will need several more speed subs (and thus less damage/healing/etc) to maintain their current action economy. Or a character could permanently upend the resource economy or weaknesses by increasing SP or energy gain or implanting a specific weakness before every battle. \n\nI remember hearing about a leak saying there were 3 more planned, with one speed passive and one passive giving 2 bonus levels on every trace, though I both can't remember where I heard that and can't point to it so grains of salt.

That's definitionally contradictory. It's impossible for me to do both. \n\nI can't **pretend** that she \"has everything\" if I'm doing a \"narrow\" analysis of kit power. Thankfully, my intentions were exceedingly clear, as you rightly pointed out that what I was \"looking at is power\". So, clearly, we **both** know that I never was talking about the story, and therefore it has no relevancy to anything I said nor anything I was responding to (I respond to exactly what I quote, as in Herta **literally** makes you \"win the game\").  \n\nHowever, it appears as though some of what I wrote isn't clear because Castorice being \"THE ENTIRE PACKAGE\" that **needs** to do \"top damage\" is **not** something that I asked for. And I take issue with any implication that this is at all what I mean. \n\nRecall, that my \"problem with Cas' kit is that she's legit just weaker Herta\", and that there's \"genuinely not a single situation where I can imagine fielding Castorice over Herta...\". Unlike in 2.X where not \"every character was as easy to use, but they still had clear strengths and weaknesses over each other\". In other words, I believe that good \"balancing is when characters have similar levels of strength paired with clear areas of expertise\". \n\nIn case it isn't crystal clear what my issue is, even if she were **better** Herta my argument would **barely** change. Her being **weaker** is merely salt, though a lot of it, on the wound when we consider how much more **expensive** she is. \n\n\"Also just wait till 3.3 when she'll probably be ahead of theherta with her healer partner anyway\" in no way solves the problem I've outlined. It just makes it sting less (and would **still** make her more expensive). However, perhaps you can take a similar wait and see approach to Herta's story involvement to see if she becomes \"THE ENTIRE PACKAGE\".     \n\nBecause, while Herta fans \"got a unit that had about 20 minutes of story spotlight(unless you want to pretend her little dolls count which i would say hell no)\" do you remember Acheron? How much story focus did she get in her debut patch? What about future patches? \n\nAccurate leakers have spoken a bit about the later half of 3.X story. Make of that what you will. If you know you know.  \n\ntldr: Castorice's kit is an ass version of Herta's and no story involvement, that we BOTH know Herta will get more of, will justify that. Even if her kit was better it would STILL be bad because it's practically the SAME FUCKING KIT. Where's the IDENTITY (in terms of use case \\[hint: imagine you have both of them. When do you choose Cas over Herta\\]). It being STRICTLY worse (compare st and aoe, Castorice has a fucking bounce attack to even try to compete with Herta's guaranteed Singe target. BOUNCE!!) and more EXPENSIVE just makes it even more dog shit. Full stop. NOTHING will justify that.",

She has a gimmick (team hp-drain, and healing as energy), but not a real niche (area of excellence, or type of content we can expect her to excel at relative to peers).\n\nHer kit atm has her positioned as a direct Herta competitor (look at how she also uses Tribbie \\[hp scaling for a reason\\], and notice how her patch's PF has ice and quant weakness on the exact same side). The issue is that as a direct competitor she's more expensive, harder to run, worse vertical investment, and at best you have the same performance. \n\nSo what I'd have liked to see instead is her being a Herta alternative that excels in different solutions. For example, we could have Herta as an aoe boss nuker, and have Castorice specialize in using her aoe to get rid of the adds and haver her bounce nuke the bounce once the adds have been killed. \n\nThis would allow Herta to be better in situations where adds are always rotating in and Castorice to better in situations where adds can be kept to a minimum. Basically, Castorice as a Herta that excels with fewer targets while Herta is a Castorice that excels with more targets. \n\nThe issue currently is Castorice has neither the numbers nor rotation to support such a play style. If that does end up being her play style Hyacine won't be optional either. Which further adds to the expense. \n\nI fundamentally think this is bad design. \n\nEverything past this point is speculation on Castorice's intended play style and why it'd still be bad for the game, if true (at least to some extent). Feel free to ignore: \n\nLikewise, there are other idiosyncrasies with her kit that don't make any sense without other teammates, but they also don't even really tell you what hoyo want from her. Like how the dragon applies res pen for the entire team, suggesting multi-dps, but e1+e2 only works when you immediately blow up the dragon which means there's no more team buff and so multi-dps is weakened (AA also makes RMC buff uptime worse). What's the vision here? Where does Hyacine fit? \n\nE2 seems to suggest ult spamming, but this can unironically actually make her really broken and the \"powercreep\" that everyone wants to avoid. Like if Hyacine enables her to nuke twice per cycle then she just ends up as better Herta, but if she doesn't nuke twice per cycle she's just worse (in all non pure st scenarios). The latter isn't even that unlikely as it would make the paltry, and as of now nonsensical, 12% AA of her LC, that doesn't even enable Sunday synergy, activate twice and actually be useable. \n\nBut this just makes her better Herta (on average). Which is still bad design, and the \"powercreep\" everyone says they hate. As of now it feels like she'll either end up as strictly better or strictly worse and neither are good options (if the dragon is ever basically allowed to consistently act twice per 100 AV then she's just better on avg). This is why I'd rather see the proper rebalancing done to her kit rather than other characters.\n\nAnd instead of being either better or worse Herta she can just be different Herta. One with a well defined use case.",

Not to mention the rumors spreading about powercreep becoming more and more unforgiving. And honestly, the reputation is well deserved right now.\n\nI don't know if this leak is true. It's possible Cas will be gigabuffed in V4 (or she already is much more powerful than people realize).

In Cas's case, for instance, everyone started saving for her before even knowing if they would like her as a character, due to the reasoning: \"anniversary unit = broken\", while skipping everyone else because \"bait\". The mentality of only pulling for \"special units\" is already spreading, and I'd assume it's a bad thing for hoyo, since their other characters won't sell AND people will have time to save. If they made the anniversary unit good, but roughly on par with everyone else, one \"established pattern\" would die, and maybe people would look at \"filler\" characters like Mydei and Aglaea more favorably. More people could be persuaded to pull for characters they like, if they don't feel the threat of the \"anniversary unit\" powercreeping everyone soon after.\n\nOr maybe I'm just rambling and all this doesn't make any sense.",

She was an easy skip for me since I have no bird siblings. No Sunday or Robin for Aglaea is just asking for a bad time (unless you have Aggy E1) from what I've gathered, but I could be wrong.\n\nTherta though? Yeaah she's super easy to play and super super super strong. No further comment on that lol. I think it's fine to have easy to play and strong characters in the game as well as more nuanced ones.",

It's mostly about the rest of the cast where they really need to be more mindful as to how many characters a year will be the strongest of the game. \n\n\nChasing every new dps also come with chasing their best team anyways, it's more efficient to concentrate on your favourite characters/one team instead.\n\nHere's hoping Jingliu will be in the batch of old units they said they'll buff",

It sounds so good, a universal support for the new path they're adding.\n\nBut now here we are, and the second ever Remembrance unit they're releasing is tailor made to NOT work with Sunday. It's not a specialization problem like JQ is where only Acheron can take advantage of his kit, this unit is explicitly designed to make Sunday's features irrelevant. As I said in another comment:\n\n* His buff is awkward to maintain due to how her summon appears and disappears\n* She doesn't use traditional energy so his extra regen doesn't work\n* More actions means more hp drain, possibly outpacing healers (though v3 makes this slightly less of an issue now)\n* Crit buff is nice I guess?",
