Also pulled Tribbie thinking of her synergy with future characters, and of course gonna get Castorice for another variation of the Remembrance team.\n\nIt will also be fun to run Aglaea + Castorice in SU/DU just for the novelty and challenge of trying to make them work together, like using Sunday's buffs on Aglea and RMC's buffs on Castorice. Games are about fun, so might as well play around with these characters and test things out.",

There is also a strat of giving Lingsha the colorless break to help break enemies faster for Firefly to start super breaking. You can also potentially run sustainless with Hmc, Fugue, and Ruan Mei's delays all giving you survivability.\n\nUltimately it all comes down to whether you want to keep investing in Firefly or getting a new character. Firefly isn't even the biggest beneficiary from Fugue, so if you plan on getting any of the other 2 break dps you could also get Fugue. Break is starting to get weaker though so purely from a meta perspective I would just recommend investing in the new characters.",

The reason for both is that it can allow FF to turn 1 break 180 toughness enemies and get the exo-break with the e2 proc.\u00a0\n\nE1 Fugue on FF then E1 Lingsha ult allows this, so without E1 Lingsha ult I would say that E1 Fugue isn\u2019t really as valuable (remember breaking speed needs to be measured in actions not just toughness bar reduction), especially in comparison to Tribbie E1.\u00a0\n\nHowever, Tribbie E1 isn\u2019t super worth for Herta (especially E2) either (relatively speaking). That\u2019s mostly more due to E1 Tribbie converting aoe damage to single target damage, so the more evenly distributed your aoe is the better it uplifts your dps.\n\nHerta already has pretty massive single target damage (especially at E2), so comparatively E1 Tribbie doesn\u2019t matter as much. On the other hand, Castorice seems like she could get more value from it because all her relevant attacks are fully aoe, and at the same multiplier, except her bounce. Which E1 Tribbie can help in case it attacks the wrong enemies.\u00a0\n\nHowever, Hyacine could end up being much more important, so make sure you have enough for her if you plan to get Castorice.\u00a0\n\u00a0",
