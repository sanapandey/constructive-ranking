That and element resistance is also not fun to deal with when her damage is already not that high these days without going sustainless. \n\nThey don't want to upset the people who whaled, but they have also been trying to make the endgame \"E2 or bust\" for FF for multiple patches now and killing her f2p teams.",

If you try hard enough, everyone will look like they belong in Imaginary. You literally reasoned this *after* his element was revealed. And I thought It was never about how the character looks/works? How come people say red doesn't mean fire, but turn around and try to justify him being imaginary using his crystals instead? Can I also say crystals doesn't mean Imaginary then? Also are we gonna ignore other fire elements presented everywhere else and tunnel vision on the crystals?",

Hell, even her Eidolons don't offer particularly great upgrades in the way previous 5 Stars have, it feels like they were a bit too scared of making her 'too broken', but for both an anniversary unit and one they're selling with such a polarizing thing as a global passive you would expect her to at least be easily on par with an AOE-dedicated DPS that came out just 2 patches ago despite neither of their \"BIS units\" (Anaxa and Hyacine technically) being out yet, not slightly worse.\n\n(Granted, if they just go and buff him in V4 this may be a pointless argument anyway, but at the moment is strictly the truth)",

But Hoyo often disguises stuff under a different name (Lingsha just sustain wink-wink, Fugue is a nihility with DDD built-in her E2 because they knew what her place in the team is). \n\nPeople want everything to be easy: easy to build, easy to sustain, best free supports and nothing to give up.
