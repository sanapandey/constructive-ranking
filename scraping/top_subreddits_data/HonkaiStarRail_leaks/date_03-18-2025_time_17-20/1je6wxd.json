Tribbie even as a DDD build helps too)\n\neven against \u201csingle-target\u201d bosses like Kafka, he cheeses the whole mechanic by applying weakness to her, breaking ice out of space and purple dino before they even move, then being able to focus her down once broken\n\nkilling first phase with a skill lets second skill smuggle weaknesses and toughness onto the second phase\n\nfinishing with basic attack is the best thing ever",

It is currently the turn of Sunday\u2122, you have three Skill Points\u2122 left, and he has his signature Light Cone\u2122 which will give a Skill Point\u2122 as well as his Talent\u2122 active to refund a Skill Point\u2122. Because Sunday\u2122 is not a DPS character, he will do about 10 damage from his Basic Attack\u2122. If you use his Skill on the DPS character , he can advance and provide buffs to them so that they can do 500K damage.\n\nHonkai: Star Rail\u2122 autoplay artificial intelligence: ayoooo sunday best BA dps",

This demonstrates an extraordinary and delicate manipulation of reality.!<\n\n>>!For example, during Emperor Rubert's campaign, Aha's believers kicked off another riot after the Philosopher Union was reduced to the domain of inorganic life, infecting the conqueror's computer systems with another troll virus called the \"Philosopher's Poison\" and overthrowing the local robot army.!<\n\n>>!**Similar miracles abound, and tiny ripples eventually become a tsunami that can shake the whole world \u2014 this is Aha's style.**!<\n\n>!this really describes Aha's deal!<",

Nous, Finality, Remembrance, etc all seem to believe (or at least act under the assumption) that fate is unchangeable. But Mythus, Aha, and perhaps even the trailblaze believe that fate can be changed and nothing is certain. It's a really fun dichotomy and I hope the eventual aeon war things seem to be heading towards makes use of this.!<",

The mods' entire function in this subreddit is to read through everything that is posted and filter what is and isn't OK. A lot of comments on showcases are repeats of things that were already said on the showcase posted only a short bit before that, and a lot of other comments are just completely off base speculation said with complete confidence, and I imagine reading so much of that must get tiring.\n\nBut even though I do empathise with the mods, this doesn't seem to really be working",

You can replace one of the other Paths in the pool with Remembrance, I guess, but that adds another arbitrary thing to do on top of selecting which characters you want that doesn't need to be there. \n\n* This would give us Ruan Mei (first limited Harmony in the game, BTW) on day 1 and Huohuo on the second update to the pool, and meanwhile only on the third update to the pool would we get *Jingliu* (which would be in the same update as *Robin*, if they're evenly releasing one character of each Path per update). Path releases are not even, which means that you're going to get situations like with Destruction where they're still sifting through really old units while Preservation doesn't even presently have a third to add to the pool. \n\n* People are going to optimize their loss pool no matter what restrictions you put on it. They're not going to put Jingliu in their loss pool if they don't want her no matter how you restrict them, and as time goes on you're going to get sub-DPS/supportive units of every Path (Topaz, Blade for Castorice, Jade when we get to 2.X units) that people will almost certainly favor over a focal point DPS they don't want.\n\n* Is this a problem that really needs solving? Is having a 50/50 loss pool that features Ruan Mei *and* Sparkle going to cause any more problems than one that only features Ruan Mei? The entire point of having good things to lose your 50/50 to is that it motivates one to *keep* pulling, because even losses provide something potentially desirable (which baits out more impulsive pulling, and in turn more impulsive spending).",

            "body": ">!One day, after dinner, while my younger sister and I were lounging about in Mr. Gopher Wood's yard, we spotted a fledgling Charmony Dove all on its own. That baby bird was tiny, it didn't even have all of its feathers, and it couldn't sing. When we found it, it was already on its last breath, having fallen into a shrub \u2014 probably abandoned by its parents. We decided to build a nest for it right there and then. However, thinking back, that winter was unusually cold, with fierce winds at night in the yard, not to mention the many poisonous bugs and wild beasts in the vicinity... It was clear that if we left the fledgling in the yard, it stood no chance of surviving until spring. So, I suggested we take it inside, place it on the shelf by the window, and asked the adults to fashion a cage for it. We decided that when it regained its strength enough to spread its wings, we would release it back into the wild. The tragic part \u2014 something that we'd never considered \u2014 was that this bird's fate had already been determined long before this moment... Its destiny was determined by our momentary whim. Now, I pass the power of choice to you all. Faced with this situation, what choice would you make? Stick to the original plan, and build a nest with soft net where the Charmony Dove fell? Or build a cage for it, and feed it, giving it the utmost care from within the warmth of a home? I eagerly await your answer.!<",

I had some thoughts to share but the comment was deleted.\n\n\nSo I'll just say it in case that person is still lurking.\n\n\n\n\nI've heard testing indicates Mydei is still a little stronger, but even if the two are comparable? Mydei has some awesome features that Cast does not.\u00a0\n\n\nHe taunts(therefore protects your squishies),\u00a0 can ignore CC, can self heal, can reject death multiple times and just gets back up.\u00a0 And then the cherry on top is that he's also high damage.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWhat all these benefits means is that he can go sustainless at low investment(e0s1) and with the right teammates(rmc, sunday).\n\n\nSo that means Mydei can do the following ...\n\nMydei + sunday + two more harmony.\n\nMydei + RMC + debuffer + harmony.\u00a0\n\nMydei + sunday + a second DPS + that second DPS' favorite support.\n\n\nHave you imagined a Mydei + Phainon buddy cop team? That might literally end up being a beast team in the future.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOr Mydei with future damage dealers.\u00a0 He may show up out of the blue during 4.x or 5.x beta tests because of his self-sustain/team-protection utility.\u00a0\n\n\nCastorice is far more likely to be pigeonholed into specific teams then Mydei.\u00a0 Presuming their damage output is close,\u00a0\u00a0I would not trade castorices situation for mydeis.\u00a0\u00a0Hes going to be a fun tool to have.\u00a0\n\n\nSo no I'm not bitter if Cast is close or slightly above Mydeis damage since I'm simply too excited about his future.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThat is all.\u00a0\u00a0",

And How are we so sure Castorice is likely to be shoehorned into specific teams compared Mydei? Castorice's kit is actually a lot less selfish than Mydei's too.\n\nWell, it's nice imagining about it, but that's all in Hoyo's hands on whether or not they want to keep him relevant or not, so unfortunately people are just going to judge him as he is.",

Got a new Headpiece that had both speed and breakefect, so I level it to 15 and only got rolls into def%. I decided to use the one reroll I had saved up, surely I'll roll into speed at least once to make it speedwise the same as the old but with more breakefect... and got 2 rolls into break and into def%, still only 2 speed.

I'm using an ERR piece tho to get the ult faster since I'm trying out QpQ as his LC (I want to run a Castorice/Tribbie/Mydei Team, and wanted to combat Mydei being energy hungry this way). However by now I've settled at 160 speed and a BE 2 set bonus instead to be at 80 BE in battle now, which is still below the cap of 150. I might just cave in and go to the LC that gives bonus BE when Castorice drops, since the self-heal on NAs should charge her instead. Probably will have to do some testing then to figure out what feels best\n\nEDIT: Wow, mere moments after I posted this we get a leak that QpQ also can choose Castorice as its target and waste its efect that way. Well, this sucks but makes things easier I suppose",

That means him +\n\n- Pela (40%) + Sweaty Luka LC (16% at S5) hits 96%\n- SW (53%) hits 93% (add on Sweaty Luka LC to hit 101% even without the def reduce bug debuff)\n- Pela (40%) + quantum set on Anaxa (20%) hits 100% and lets Pela loop ults with tutorial LC\n- Fugue (18%) + Sweaty Luka LC (16%) + Quantum set on Anaxa (20%) = 94% (similarly superbreak set is 25% for Anaxa instead, hitting 99%)\n\nI'm sure you probably don't want to run a def debuffer over another harmony (or especially a harmony with def ignore eidolons if you have them), but as someone who was trying out Herta x2 + Fugue + RM in the current PF yesterday, I'm salivating lmaooo. This dude is gonna be so fun, I can't wait.\n\nHe's just so flexible! So many viable playstyles, builds, etc. I was on the fence about getting his LC as it really is more of a luxury pull, and it'd probably be better to get THerta LC for the sp, for example. But I think I'm gonna do it anyways. I just like him too much and need to spoil him hehe",

To me being able to have fun with him in so many different comps, builds, matchups, etc is much more valuable than damage-per-screenshot or low cycle clears. It'll let me keep him fresh and fun for a long time, I feel like.\n\nI think a transition animation for his extra skill is SUCH a good way to put it too. It always felt weird to me to want a different animation for the second activation of his skill, because they go out of their way to explicitly say it's a second activation of the skill lol, not a FuA or whatever. But a transition animation would go a loooong way I feel in giving the best of both worlds and bringing his animation from A+ to S tier for me too.",

The current \"big\" event with the chimeras is cute and all but really not that fun - and also relatively short. Apart from Trailblaze missions, there's really not much to look forward to in these past couple of patches (I enjoyed Tribios arc very much, tho!). Next one doesn't look much better, even though it's anniversary. ZZZ on the other hand has been on an upswing since Miyabi's release and their \"re-launch\". I'm much worse at that game but it's been much more fun for me, really enjoyed Astra's patch, and will play the new story content sometime this week. Just wanted to get that out there, I'm sure a lot of players share a similar sentiment atm and are not that happy with the product lately... for various reasons. Hopefully, everything turns out well since I feel like HSR has so much potential.",

Since Herta provides 80 crit damage, you can focus more on Crit Rate, Speed, and Attack% substats (but getting more Crit Damage is still helpful). If you're running him with a support that's on DDD, you can set his speed at 134 and be perfectly fine.

He got an 800% multiplier in ST, for comparison Feixiao's Ult does 700% ST, he gets 100% DMG against 5 enemies, more DEF Shred (OG Quantum Set is now more viable) and he can be played Hypercarry or Sub-DPS.\n\nI just wish they would give him a new animation for his additional skill (I understand they wouldn't have time since his kit got changed ofc but a man can dream) so I'll keep manifesting.\n\n* Castorice now became more OP with E1 switching to T3 and vice versa, I remember in v3 she usually deals 500-700k Total DMG in one instance of a full-HP Dragon attacks (Including the final detonation)...now she deals 600-900k in one showcase I've seen by the same person, that's a 200k DMG increase.\n\nSince v5 is only 2 days away I assume they only do wording changes since v4 is usually the wording changes update and v5 is where the true changes happens but I hope they give ma boi some new animations.\n\nAnyway both Castorice and Anaxa nations won and hopefully less people are angry (Tho knowing this fandom I won't be surprised to see some keep posting pictures of Doom)",

Anaxa's sig also gets further ahead of the event LC when you stack more def ignore (Anaxa e1, Sunday e1, Genius 4pc). \n\nOtherwise, Big Herta's sig is the best hypercarry option for him with Scholar/Pioneer because his Ult timing doesn't matter as much and it provides more damage amp and SP. He would still be using an atk rope in this case.\n\nThe event LC is a very good budget option, but if you're looking for a 2T ult with it, you do have to use an energy rope.

Once Acheron in E2, or if she didn\u2019t have this limitation in E0, reach is similar case like Rice. JQ would be less important to Acheron.

Meanwhile Phainon is a commoner (hence a beta) from Okehema who once got lost at the border between the two regions and got saved by Mydei as a child. Both became childhood best friends. Another possible route is that Phainon is actually the Prince of Okhema and was betrothed to Mydei ever since the two were born (for politics etc etc). Unfortunately Phainon is a beta (usually in these kinda ABO settings royalties/nobles are supposedly to consist exclusively of Alphas) and is seen as a disgrace by other nobles (in both Okhema and Kremnos) + his family to an extent. This option has a lot of potential for angst cause the whole \"betas are usually inferior to alphas\" trope plays really well into how Mydei is so composed and \"flawless\" compared to how Phainon is somewhat impulsive and dense in canon I think. Now that Cyrene is still alive (and a fujo actually) we gotta give Phainon a reason to have low self-esteem after all!!<",

So I'm going to be skipping both of them with plans of getting them both at their earliest reruns. Anaxa has the new hyper specific event lightcone coming out, but Cas doesn't really have any good 4* options other than the BP cone. I'd be reluctant to pull for her, even on her rerun, if she doesn't have a good 4* option and is still tethered to either her signature or to a $10 lightcone off the BP, so hopefully we can get an HP scaling 4* remembrance cone alongside Hyacine or something.",

If they had made buffs in MOC work closer to how they work in PF/AS (where you get to pick between multiple potential options that catered to different teams) or just tuned down MOC so that much shittier teams had a more reasonable time, nobody would be complaining about powercreep because they aren't affected by it anymore.
