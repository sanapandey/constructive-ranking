    "selftext": "   Okay my boyfriend owns a tree company and one of his friends who's a neighbor of ours two houses down or so... Apparently had warrants which we didn't know about, he contacted my boyfriend because there was someone on the other end of town that needed a truckload of wood and wanted to buy it from us which is an abnormal.... \n\n    So he loaded up his truck with all this firewood and went to this house, where one of the police officers in town (k9 unit) jumped out in the middle of the street, started pulling his gun out on him and demanding him to roll his window down.... \n(His truck's a little broken on that door so he has to open the door almost all the way before he can roll his window down) \n\nAnd also started accusing him of being in cahoots with this person with the warrants...? And the officer basically set him up because he thought the neighbor guy was going to be with him. \n\n**For the record that neighbor person has went with him on a FEW tree jobs and I'm talking like maybe three, he also doesn't normally go with to deliver firewood or do anything like that as it is... \n\nBoyfriend is shook, he's not getting any money for this wood that he spent forever loading and he's just uncomfortable with the whole situation... \n\nWhat should we/CAN we do about this? \nWas anything here done illegally? \n\n\nlocation: Iowa",

Is this correct?\n\n* A neighbor told your boyfriend that someone across town wanted to buy wood from your boyfiend.\n\n* Your boyfriend went (where?) and loaded up wood (from whom?) into his truck.\n\n* He goes to \"this house\" (owned by whom?) and the police are there waiting. Why?\n\n* The police made him roll down the window, but didn't do anything else.\n\n* Now he has firewood. \n\nSo why can't he deliver the firewood?",

Wanted guy asks boyfriend to deliver a load of wood to someone random. Suddenly the cops are there holding him at gun point? That doesn\u2019t make sense",
