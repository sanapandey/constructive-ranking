He put it as a gift on the paperwork so I wouldn\u2019t have to pay sales tax. \n\nDue to some conflict I am trying to move out which my parents are against. My dad has threatened to repossess my car. I am making payments 2 times a month on the car. \n\nCan he legally repossess the car?",

The car is yours, in your name. \n\nIf you have to lie to him and kiss ass in order to safely prepare for your escape, you should swallow your pride and do so. It'll be safer and easier for you. \n\nMake sure no bank accounts shared jointly. Open an individual checking account at a DIFFERENT bank, ideally where your parents don't bank. Get your documents in order (social security card, birth certificate, passport, anything).",

To be 100% honest, he has no legal standing even if you stop paying. It's his word against the paperwork. Paperwork is evidence. If you have a document saying it was a gift and no contract to pay him back, you could just stop paying and drive away. \n\nYou are an adult.
