She is still missing a chunk of her thumb.\n\nI\u2019ve reached out to lawyers who basically have said the payout wouldn\u2019t be enough to take the case.\n\nCan I sue on my own? File a complaint? It seems unjust that this nurse injures my child and has no consequence. ",

            "body": "Medical malpractice/negligence is very complex both in if it can be pursued and if it is worth pursuing. \n\nGetting them to pay the additional immediate medical costs without employing a lawyer may be viable (they may do that without you even needing to do anything). \n\nBut getting anything beyond that such as pain and suffering, loss of function, future medical costs etc. would be difficult to do without a lawyer. If there is any potential for long term damage I strongly recommend speaking to a lawyer. She may be dealing with this for years to come and the best odds to get her fair compensation may be getting a lawyer.\n\nAs for complaints against the nurse, you can complain to the hospital and/or nursing board for your state (there may be additional organizations that regulate this situation in your location). YMMV what will come of that if anything. If you are going to pursue anything legal wise I would wait to talk to a lawyer before making any complaints.\n\nDo be aware that privacy laws/rules may mean the hospital may not be able to tell you much or anything about what actions are taken against the nurse if any due to this. So them not saying anything doesn't necessarily mean there are no consequences to the nurse.",

Some life insurances even pay out for loss of a finger or thumb. I would consult a malpractice atty.\n\n I grew up with someone who lost part of her thumb in the same exact way as an infant & had lifetime damage. She definitely had a trust that her parents set up for her from a settlement.",

Not saying it will be like this forever, but it is currently interfering with her catching up milestone wise. Things happen but it should never involve cutting part of a thumb off.

Did they cover cost of addtl treatment? \n\nDefinitely file a (factual, formal) complaint.",

Contacted 10 different lawyers and no one would touch the case, even with proof it was negligence and statements from the doctors themselves. Basically unless you die or have significant impact to life, they won\u2019t represent you. Thankfully insurance paid the bill because they weren\u2019t getting a dime straight from my pocket.",

They corrected it too quickly, leading to neurological damage. It was actually the doctors at the rehab facility who initially realized something was wrong; the doctors from the hospital never said a word that there had been complications until after questions were asked by rehab staff about why he couldn't swallow anything without aspirating. He died a year later in assisted living (had been living alone prior to the surgery). My dad and my aunt spoke with a medical malpractice lawyer and they said the hospital would argue that even if they hastened his demise, he was 80 so how many good years did he really have left anyway?
