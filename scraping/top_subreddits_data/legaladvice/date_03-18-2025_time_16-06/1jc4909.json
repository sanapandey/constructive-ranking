    "selftext": "Greetings from the mods!\n\nWe've had a flood of off-topic comments recently.  We're posting this to remind everyone that off-topic and anecdotal comments are not allowed.  An off-topic comment may subject you to a permanent ban.  \n\n**The Rule:**\n\n[Commenting Rule 1:](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index#wiki_general_rules) Comments should contain a legal answer or a strongly related non-legal answer. If it is not legal advice, do not post. Period. You will be banned.\n\n**What is \"off-topic?\"**\n\nAny response that doesn't answer the question by reference to legal information or principles.  A joke, a wisecrack, a comment about OP's formatting (use the report button instead) are all off-topic. Off-topic also includes expressions of sympathy, opinions on the law, and comments that berate the OP or anyone else.   \n\nIncidentally, simply adding \"get a lawyer\" to an off-topic comment does not make it on-topic.  And \"get a lawyer\" on its own, without further information or help, is considered unhelpful and may be removed on that basis.\n\nIf you want to discuss a post, then wait until it hits /r/bestoflegaladvice or ask a question about the subject of the post in /r/legaladviceofftopic.  The main subreddit and a comment thread are never a place to have a philosophical discussion about the law or the post.  It is a place to answer the questions asked.\n\n**What is an \"anecdote?\"**\n\nFor our purposes, anecdotes are stories about something that happened to you (or someone you know or heard about) who may have had something that might be similar that happen to them.\n\nThese comments are not helpful.  They do not include current legal information that is relevant to the OP, and therefore, they are off-topic.  If you know the answer to the question (based on current law and relevant jurisdiction) then just answer the question without the story.\n\nAnother type of anecdote is \"I don't know the law in the jurisdiction you actually asked about, but in some other state, the law is...\"  That is just not helpful.  Laws are different in different places.  These types of answers are off-topic.\n\nReferring an OP to a thread on a different subreddit, or to somewhere else on the Internet because it might include a similar situation, is anecdotal advice and not allowed. \n\nThese are not the only types of anecdotes, but they are probably the most common ones.  Again, if you are not referencing legal information or principles, your comment is probably not allowed.\n\n**Violations subject the user to an immediate and permanent ban**\n\nNot that we need to justify enforcing our rules, but this is a busy subreddit and the mods have a lot to do.  If a user shows up here, doesn't read the rules, and posts a single off-topic comment, the user may be immediately and permanently banned.  \n\nThis policy is not intended to be punitive, although we know it may seem to be.  There are a lot of you and not many of us, and banning users that do not follow the rules, even once, is in the best interests of the subreddit.  Violating the rules almost always means the user didn't bother to read them, and we simply don't have time to deal with such users.  \n\nTl;dr:  Unless you have a legal answer, do not reply to any post in this subreddit.  You may be permanently banned, even for a first offense.",
