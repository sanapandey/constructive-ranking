If accepted he will go before a court and the court will rule that he must meet certain conditions (usually repayment of what was taken, some hefty fines/penalties to the court and usually community service. Once all conditions are met the case will be basically adjudicated out and the record is sealed, so on a job application if it asks if you\u2019ve been arrested or charged with a crime you can legally check the \u2018no\u2019 box (yes, even if this falls into the felony category, which it does, he can still qualify for ARD), then after a specified time frame he can submit paperwork to get his arrest expunged. \n\nThis is a one time thing that can be done.

My friend's judge went against the point system, because, he repeated embezzlement multiple times. He ended up getting X amount of years with 80% of it being suspended.\n\nAfterwards, he will be on probation. If he violates probation, that's when you end up serving the 80% that was originally suspended.\n\nHe will also be responsible for paying it back, otherwise known as paying restitution.",

As a first time offender and if he has a home/family, he\u2019s likely going to be put on a personal recognizance bond (no bail)\n\n2) If you can pay back the $5,000, do so and sign nothing. You\u2019re talking very matter of factly, which makes me think he\u2019s already admitted guilt to you. Don\u2019t answer that. Companies do not like to pursue this if they don\u2019t have to; it ties them up, can cost them legal fees, etc. \n\n3) For $5k as a first time offender, jail time is unlikely (up front), more likely for time to be put in abeyance, meaning if you don\u2019t pay restitution that you can financially afford, you will serve time later.\n\n4) As others have mentioned, pre-trial diversion is great, pleading no contest and getting it down to a misdemeanor is next best. \n\n5) Make them work for the restitution amount, they have to prove what you stole and owe unless you admit or agree to it. This usually happens after sentencing. \n\n6) pay restitution as quickly as possible. It will usually lead to shorter probation. Not sure about expungement in Ohio but the quicker you\u2019re off probation, the quicker the clock starts on expungement timeline\n\n7) Life isn\u2019t over. When looking for a job, explain the money was paid back, a mistake was made, lessons learned. Best time is after an offer has already been made, before a background check.",
