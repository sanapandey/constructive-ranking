    "selftext": "Location: New York\n\nLast week I (F) was at a bar and my ride home didn't show. I live in a small town in New York and know almost everyone so I asked a man that lives down the road from me for a ride home and he agreed. When we left, we grabbed a case of beer from the gas station and headed toward both of our homes. \n\nWhen we got to my house, he came in for a beer and I put on some Youtube videos and we talked, nothing even close to inappropriate happened. At one point, I went to the bathroom and just as I was done, the man's wife barged in the house, made a mess of my kitchen by pushing everything off my countertops, and beat me up in the bathroom. She was only in my house for about 2.5 minutes according to the camera on my front porch. Then she tried to come back in but the door was locked and her husband told her to leave. She then grabbed a chair from my front porch and tried and failed to throw it through my living room window before leaving for good and the husband followed.\n\nI called the police but was told I couldn't give a statement that night since I was intoxicated (and honestly quite hysterical) and would have to call the next day. I called when I woke up so the police came back and I gave my statement. I have scratches and bruises all over my chest and red marks on my face but was told to take my own pictures since the officers were both male. They seemed a bit dismissive and told me that the wife would more than likely only receive a harassment ticket but that I have to wait for the responding officer to come back to work before anything is done at all. \n\nIt has been a week now and I've called the police twice but the responding officer hasn't been back to work so I'm still waiting to hear but I'm getting impatient because it was really traumatic. I don't think she will come back as it was most likely done out of anger but like I said, it's a small town and I don't want to run into her. Does this seem like a typical response to this situation? Very curious to hear opinions and advice, thank you.\n\n",

You can try to escalate it with the chief of police or whoever is in charge there but at the end of the day you can't force the police to charge someone. You can take your own private protection order if you want.",

If she feels violated, by all means keep pushing through, I\u2019m just trying to be realistic man. \n\nThe lady\u2019s husband can easily say he told her to come in not knowing she was going to assault her. And also claim it wasn\u2019t assault, it was a fight that they both engaged in. There\u2019s just so many ways that the husband (who is the only witness) can spin this in favor for his wife. It\u2019s 2v1. I\u2019d be curious what the Ring camera shows. Please update OP.",
