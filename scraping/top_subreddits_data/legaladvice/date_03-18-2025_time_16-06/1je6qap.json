Location: Florida\n\n\nThey never Intended to give me two last names but I'm scared they might have by accident\n\nI grew up thinking Machado was my middle name. But Everytime I try to apply to do my taxes it was denied. I recently looked at my birth certificate and saw that my name looks like this\n\n(First Name)               Machado Marques \n\n\nI asked my lawyer and she said it looks like two last names but since there is no hyphen there I don't know how to write it\n\n\n\nIf this is dumb please forgive me. I am very young so I'm not too behind but I just want to know how to write my name so I can pay my taxes and get over with it.",

Are you writing Machado in the middle name spot on your tax forms?\n\nThere is no reason to assume that you have two last names in any formal sense of the term. Many people have three names and absent the hyphen or something else to indicate that names 2 and 3 are intended to go together as a single surname, they're not.",

            "body": "It is extremely annoying to have two un-hyphenated last names in the US, as most systems assume the first \"word\" in your name is your middle name, and anything after that is a last name. \n\nWhen I lived there I wrote my two last names without a hyphen in all official documents, credit cards, etc. I was told, I do not remember where, that my last name had to match the spelling, including the absent hyphen, in my SSN card. I advise that you visit the SSN office and verify this, and perhaps ask if you can add the hyphen to your SSN card without too much hassle so you do not get annoyed in the future by businesses writing /saving your name in all the wrong ways possible.",
