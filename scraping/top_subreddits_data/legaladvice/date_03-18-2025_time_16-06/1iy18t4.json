If you're interested in being tagged as a quality contributor and having the little star appear next to your name here, read on. \n\nUntil today the process was that we'd notice you and then contact you. We've found that that's not a very effective way to do it, because we miss a lot. It's a very active subreddit!\n\nFrom today on, we're doing self-nomination. If you meet the minimum requirements below, please send us a modmail if you're interested and we'll get back to you ASAP. \n\nQualifications are as follows:\n\n-Active for at least 3 months.\n \n-Minimum of 100 top level comments.\n\n-You can't be a jerk. \n\n-You can't delete posts when you're wrong. We need to see both the good and the bad. \n\nIf you meet the qualifications and you're interested, please send us a modmail. \n\nPlease remember that the quality contributor badge does not mean a person is always right. It means that you can generally be trusted to give solid information. \n\nWe appreciate you!",
