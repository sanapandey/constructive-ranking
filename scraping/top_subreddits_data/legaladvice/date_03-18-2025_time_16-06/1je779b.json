My sister is going to comb through his apartment since she is NOK and doesn\u2019t want the guns. I already have guns registered in my name in TN, though I doubt that matters to this situation. \n\nUnfortunately I\u2019m not able to attend with my sister in Oklahoma due to just staring a new job and two very big doggos no one can watch. \n\nHer nor I know the type of guns he had\u2026 he kept a lot of things private. \n\n1. What\u2019s the process to I guess unregister the guns from him and register them to me?\n\n2. My sister is flying from Florida to Oklahoma so how would she get them on the flight back with her to me?\n\nThank you!! \n\nUpdate: just wanted to say my sister is gonna drive so she\u2019s just gonna grab the pea shooters. Thank you everyone. Really means a lot for the help. ",

It\u2019s also legal to do a parent to child transfer as well as spouse to spouse without an FFL. \n\nI would recommend just driving and getting them. An FFL will charge you to ship and the receiving FFL will charge you for the transfer via the 4473 form. Which for all intents and purposes is registration. \n\nI would just drive them back if it were me. \n\n\nSorry for your loss.",

The exception would be NFA items like short barreled rifles,  suppressors, or machine guns. There have been more state laws recently in an effort to close the \"gun show loophole \" that restricts private party sales. Most of these laws have exemptions to allow for the transfer to family members without the need to go through a 3rd party (gun dealer with a federal firearms license) in order to complete a form 4473 and a background check.  Some more restrictive states, for example, NY, would have a state level registration and licensing process, which may vary based on county and municipality.  I believe TN is a rather free state, and as long as you are not a prohibited possessor and there are no issues with estate holdings or probate, you should be just fine to bring them into your collection.  \n\nSorry for your loss.",

I'm not sure what you think registration means but you do not have firearms registered to you, because that is not a thing where you reside.  \n\nThis is a little more complicated than just taking the firearms, depending on how they've been left to you.  If they were actually left by bequest (to you, by name, in your father's will) then you can take them from Oklahoma and transport them to Tennessee without violating any interstate transfer laws.  The same goes if your father died intestate and these are part of the disbursement of his assets under intestate succession.\n\nThere is no circumstance under which it is legal under federal law for your sister (not a resident of Oklahoma) to take possession of firearms from your father's estate and deliver them to you in Tennessee.  Unfortunately (because it will cost some money) the firearms will need to be taken to an FFL (Federal Firearms Licensee, generally a gun store or pawn shop will have an FFL on staff) in Oklahoma and will need to be sent to an FFL in Tennessee for you to go and fill out the background check form and take possession of the firearms.  Without you going to Oklahoma to take possession of the firearms from your father's estate there is no legal way to do this other than having them sent from an FFL in Oklahoma to an FFL in Tennessee.  \n\nYou should check around for the best prices at both the gun store or pawn shop in Oklahoma and the one in Tennessee, because you'll have to pay both of them for their services.  I'd expect it to cost shipping plus $20-$50 per firearm on each end of the transaction, but you may find better prices than that.\n\nThere is no registration necessary, because again, that is not a thing.",

In your situation, though, that still doesn't give your sister the legal ability to transfer the firearms to you in Tennessee, so you are indeed correct that the FFL is the best option.  Good luck, I'm sorry for your loss, and I hope you're able to keep your father's memory more alive by enjoying his guns.",
