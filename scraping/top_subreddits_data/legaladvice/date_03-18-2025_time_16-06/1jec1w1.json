    "selftext": "Location: Tarrant County, Texas, US.\n\nMe (19M) and my gf (18F) just found out that my gf's dad has been putting secret camera in her room to record her. Her dad is known as a porn addict (no legal history, people in the family just know). I always had a bad feeling about him and told my gf to be careful. And well, she just found a secret camera in her room and we can't think of anyone else that put it there. Her parents know that we do get intimate in her room and I think her dad put the camera in there to record. I'm 90% sure this isn't about me but it's to see HIS daughter naked.\nHe was confronted and when asked he said that he put it in there to make sure I wasn't r*ping her ( funny enough I told my gf hes gonna make up some excuse about me). Of course, both her and her mom doesnt believe that. So basically l and my gf were involuntarily recorded (very possibly naked) in his home. Is this something we can take legal action on?\nWe are the fence about it because my gf and her mom is still financially dependent on him, but who knows what he\u2019ll do if we let him keep pusing the boundaries. If there's any missing information please let me know, I will answer.\nThank you for the help.",

Get police involved NOW before he has a chance to destroy evidence, etc.  Keep records of everything up to this point.\n\nThere's a civil crime here too, speak to a lawyer as soon as you reasonably can.  But first priority is to get the police acting on it before he has a chance to hide existing evidence.",

What he did is the crime of voyeurism.\n\nAlso she needs to move out immediately, police or no.  Y'all are old enough and no matter what you do this is sure to escalate if she keeps living there.\n\nFinally, this is reddit, not tiktok, and your posts will still be seen if you don't censor words like rape.",

I\u2019m not from the US and only recently became a citizen through military so I dont know the laws very well. In my country if this happen we just would just kinda\u2026 beat the hell out of him and make sure he doesn\u2019t have the hands and legs to do it again and then throw him to the authorities (and they wont care). It seems to work everytime in my country and I\u2019d love to the same thing again. But this is the US, so I\u2019m taking the rational route and asking here for advice.",

Tell them that you'd like to report a crime, and then tell them everything you wrote in your post. The kind thing to do would be to give your girlfriend a heads up that you're doing it, but to absolutely do it.",
