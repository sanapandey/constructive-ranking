    "selftext": "I was arrested in Minnesota last night. I failed the field sobriety test and the cop said I smelled of alchol. I get arrested for dui and go to the jail. At the jail I blew 0.00 twice. They then realized I was sober. And drove me home.  \n\n  Today the police refused to give me a copy of the police report or body camera footage. \n   \nWhat are my options. The whole situation seems very fishy to me.  \n\nEdit I failed the hgn eye test.  There also was a  half bottle of liquor (dumb) in the back of the car. They didn't find it until after the arrest.",

Send it regular mail AND certified.  In said letter, state that you want a copy of the body cam in addition to the report.\n\nSend a copy to both the police chief AND the prosecuting attorney's office (DA).  Follow up in 10 days if you do not receive a response.  State SECOND REQUEST in capital letters and attach 1st letter.\n\nYou should get a response.  Depending on the response, you may want to either escalate or discuss settlement.  Good luck OP.",

Most (all?) states have some kind of implied consent law mandating that you submit to specific types of testing under specific circumstances. To the best of my knowledge those consent laws all require some level of suspension (generally probable cause). As with all things these vary by jurisdiction. \n\nPBTs (portable breath tests) are a more reliable indicator than SFSTs, assuming that the PBT is administered properly. SFSTs are pseudoscience at best and outright bullshit more generally. \n\nCertified Breath test (done at an arrestee processing area, and NOT the little ones an officer carries) or a blood draw are what is admissible in court as actual evidence of a specific BAC. \n\nTestimony regarding SFSTs may or may not be allowed, as evidence of intoxication, but should never actually be used to state a specific BAC. Generally officers can testify about things like  slurring words and forgetting steps of the test, which are 'clues,' even if the SFSTs aren't done properly. \n\nAm a lawyer, but not any of yours, don't refuse any tests without getting a solid understanding of your local laws.",

Your prior driving record can also play a role. It can also lead to license suspensions or enhancements if you are charged down the road.\n\nI've tried cases in jurisdictions where refusal was admissible against you as evidence of guilt. I've also won a case with a refusal, and the refusal caused my guy to lose his license. That's a pretty common consequence of the implied consent statutes. He wasn't the driver, hence the not guilty verdict, but the refusal stuck anyway.\n\nThe only advice I can give is don't drink and drive and also be aware of laws regarding marijuana and driving. Some states don't even require intoxication with weed, just a certain amount of the metabolite (byproduct from using) in your system.\n\nI'd personally also try to avoid SFSTs and ask for a blood draw or breath test. That may run afoul of the law in some jurisdictions so you'd have to be very careful to make the request while avoiding a refusal.\n\n Again it's all a poop shoot and way too jurisdictionally and factually specific for me to tell anyone what to do. It's also not really my area of expertise. I was previously very well versed in the laws of one state but have since moved and I'm still figuring out some of the nuances where I am now.",

Clearly the cop was just out to be a dick that night. \n\nThe idea is that by refusing the FST, you don't give the cops any more evidence to convict you of a DUI. If OP had refused and only taken the breathalyzer, there's no way a prosecuter could say he was stumbling or had poor balance to try and say he was intoxicated \n\nBut since he took the test, the cops will not down any infractions and use them against OP in court. \n\nIn short - it's about minimizing the evidence that the cops have against you. If a cop is asking you to take a field sobriety test - expect to go to jail that night. They're not \"asking\", they're hoping you'll do it so they can secure an easy DUI arrest. Without the FST it becomes much harder for the cops to have enough evidence to arrest you with confidence, and so even if you do go to jail, your case is that much stronger when you go to court.",

And of course is there a suggestion of racial animus.\n\nNews reports reflect that a man named Harris Elias sued police in Loveland, Colorado after he was pulled over in 2022, accused of having an \u201coverwhelming odor of alcohol,\u201d he refused to do field sobriety tests, was arrested, blew a 0.0, was then accused on being on drugs, made to do a blood test, then released without being jailed, with charges later dropped when blood test was negative.\n\nThat case settled for $400,000.  There can be big money in suing police officers for the humiliation and indignity of a wrongful arrest. City managers in states like Colorado and Minnesota often don\u2019t want to let a local jury put a price on what these claims of police overreach are worth.\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting that OP has a $400,000 claim here. That\u2019s unlikely. We have no idea really.",

With that being said, will you perform FSEs?\" If you get arrested, they will then ask for breath and/or urine sample. \n\nThen, if the DUI ever makes it to trial, the prosecutor will be able to bring up the fact that you refused to do FSEs, were informed that the officer would make arrest decision if you refused, and you still refused. Then the prosecutor will make the argument of \"Why would a sober person refuse and get arrested?\".\n\nOf course you have the chance to rebut with \"I was told never to do FSEs\" or \"I have been told FSEs are reliable\". The big issue is the factfinders are 6 lovely members of your community - who the fuck knows which side they will be on.\n\nAlternatively, if you perform FSEs, one of two things can happen - (a) no signs of impairment and you likely will be released or (b) signs of impairment and you will get arrested. If option (b) occurs, you will then be requested to provide breath and/or urine sample.\n\nTo be honest with you, I do not ever believe there is a one size fits all as to whether to perform FSEs or blow. Every case is fact specific in determining what the best route is. However, when in doubt, it may be beneficial to default into not performing FSEs, maybe.",

It became a viral YT video.\n\nThe kid sued for wrongful arrest. City moved for summary judgement. The court looked at the bodycam and rejected the officer\u2019s claim that the kid showed signs of impairment. \n\nI don\u2019t think any of us can reasonably say it\u2019s \u201clikely\u201d the officer who arrested OP had probable cause, based on the limited facts OP has given us.\n\nhttps://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66782778/77/galanakis-v-city-of-newton-iowa/",

In a 2021 peer reviewed study in Scientific Reports, 43 of 44 test subjects who impaired by marihuana exhibited HGN within three hours of smoking, and it was actually present in 42 test subjects, within 20 minutes, but steeply dropped to 10 beyond the three hour window. There\u2019s other literature with similar findings. Yes, def not indicated by SFST but law enforcement agencies and prosecutors are beginning to test the limitations. Would be curious to see a court\u2019s evaluation of it, can\u2019t recall seeing it, but would be interested to see the analysis and what it will take \u2014 I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s just part of the constellation of factors used to prove impairment and it won\u2019t be a single determinative factor that carries the same weight of a test like a calibrated breathalyzer test.\n\nEdit: Commonwealth v Gerhardt (477 Mass 775 [2017]), the state Supreme Court recognized the different medical literature that found marijuana can lead to positive HGN but also that it was not consistent, as other research indicted it was not always a proper assessment tool and not recognized yet by the acronym salad that was tossed out there.",

Could be because the THC levels in cannabis products today is generally quite a bit higher than it was a couple decades ago.  Maybe the higher concentrations are causing it.  That wouldn\u2019t be unprecedented.

That said in every state I looked up lawyers recommend you refuse as passing has very little benefit and most the time you're still arrested even if you pass. \n\nHowever every state it's illegal to refuse a BAC test at a police station. Here about half of lawyers still recommend you still actually refuse one if you know for a fact you will fail (if the arrest is due to an accident and there was a serious injury or death many states can do a blood test without your consent) it's pretty unlikely but if the cops didn't follow mandatory procedures they could still get you off.",

The field sobriety test and field breathalyzers are usually not used as evidence of drunkenness but to establish probable cause to arrest you and enforce a stricter test, which is why they brought you back to breath on the calibrated machine which you passed.\n\n  \nThis is pretty normal, even if you think there was malice here, they can list any number of small things you did during the field sobriety test as to why they think you failed and that established probable cause to bring you back to test on the calibrated machine.\n\n  \nKeep in mind that portable breathalyzers and the one in the station are two very different matters, in many states you can refuse the field breathalyzer, but refusing the one at the station can get you cited for refusal. In the future, do not answer questions, do not willingly submit to any tests you are not required to submit to, remember that cops are allowed to lie, and remember that if they truly want to arrest you and make you blow into the machine at the station all they really have to do is say they smell the strong odor of alcohol and then hide behind qualified immunity.",

            "body": "I\u2019m a former deputy sheriff and have made many DUI arrests. People often assume that DUI is solely for driving drunk from alcohol but it is also for driving under the influence of chemical or controlled substances-i.e. Xanax, cannabis, opioid pain medication, etc. People can even have a prescription to take a certain medication but if it impairs their driving then is it illegal to drive while under the influence of it. It would be up to the evidence in court to prove that you were operating your motor vehicle while impaired. \n\nAn officer can develop probable cause of your impairment based on your driving, their interaction with you, and using field sobriety testing. If you are stopped and asked to submit to sobriety testing most states have laws that will revoke your license for a period of time if you refuse to submit. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you are impaired or not nor whether you are invoking your constitutional rights to prevent incriminating yourself. Driving is a privilege so you can invoke your rights without penalty in criminal court but the state can still revoke your driving privileges administratively for the refusal. People often don\u2019t realize that the submission to sobriety testing is part of their documentation that they agree to when obtaining their licenses. \n\nField sobriety testing is a validated way to indicate probability that the person performing them is impaired. Failing multiple parts obviously drastically increases that probability. However, there are also people who have HGN naturally or due to some cause that is not related to alcohol or drug use. An officer should use the sobriety tests as a secondary factor for their probable cause since they have already observed your driving behavior and interaction with you. That is why someone could be arrested for DUI but blow 000 on the breath test. In the jurisdiction that I worked there would always be a urine sample collected if someone blew less than the legal limit. Many of those results would later come back with drugs in their system but there were a few times that the person blew less than the legal limit and urine was clean. Some of those cases were dismissed and some were prosecuted because my documentation and evidence showed that the person was driving the vehicle while impaired. The reason for this is because the legal limit on the breath test is the limit at which the state assumes that you are impaired. People can be impaired well below that due to various factors. \n\nNeedless to say, it doesn\u2019t sound like the officer in your case did anything wrong. They acted in good faith due to the probable cause that they initially had. You subsequently blew 000 so they decided to cut you loose rather than collect a urine sample and continue with the arrest. There is nothing malicious about that.",

            "body": "I am an attorney, but not in Minnesota.\n\nYou could consider taking legal action, but it is possible that the police acted correctly even though you were innocent of that crime, because they had probable cause to arrest you. Consider getting copies of any police paperwork generated in connection with your arrest and speaking with a civil rights attorney about whether you have an actionable complaint against the police.\n\nEven though you were not under the influence, based on your description, the police arguably had probable cause to arrest you. They also did the right thing by letting you go after you blew .00.\n\nIf you smelled of alcohol and failed standardized field sobriety tests - particularly the HGN test, which is not failed due to physical factors like poor balance or surface conditions - a reasonable police officer will assume you are under the influence. \n\nYou wouldn\u2019t know if they were, but if your eyes were glassy or bloodshot, that would be another sign of intoxication. You don\u2019t say anything about a roadside breath test, which is commonly administered. It would be unusual for them to arrest you if you blew .00, unless they suspected you were under the influence of a drug, but most drugs don\u2019t cause HGN failure (or an odor of alcohol). You also don\u2019t say why you were pulled over, and how you were driving could be another sign of intoxication (eg weaving in and out of your lane or erratic movements). The open container of alcohol in your car would be another clue, but you say the police did not find it until after they arrested you, so assuming you are correct that would affect the probable cause analysis.\n\nSo there are unknowns based on your story, but I suspect that the police reports could justify an arrest. Unless you were mistreated by the police or detained for an unusually long period of time (which you don\u2019t say happened, since they drove you home and since they usually give breath tests quickly before your body metabolizes the alcohol) even if you have a valid false arrest claim, it may not be a very valuable one. Certainly worth a conversation with a qualified civil rights attorney in your area, though.",
