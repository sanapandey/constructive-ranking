So I work for a local dispensary here in New Mexico, and today my c.e.o sent out a mass message on the group chat saying \"if we discussed wages, we will be fired\" I know she legally can't, but now I'm worried because that's shady as hell. How would one go about treading these murky waters, because now I don't even want to be apart of a team like this. Any and all advice would be amazing! ",
