    "selftext": "Hi! Apologies if this is a bit confusing. Today, I had given my employer a one week notice that I will be resigning, and as a result, my employer threatened that they will retroactively lower my pay for all unpaid hours to minimum wage, as I had failed to give them a proper two weeks notice. The employer also stated that this policy was in the policy handbook that I had signed upon hiring. My question is, is this legal in the state of Kentucky? \n\n  \nLocation: KENTUCKY",

If they are stupid enough to have that policy in writing send pictures of it to the state's DoL.\nIts the same stupid thing some employers try to do with \"wage discussion\" policies, just makes it easier for the employees to win the case by having illegal store policy.",
