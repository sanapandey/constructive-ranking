    "selftext": "[Location: MS, USA] I purchased a used car from a large local dealership about 6 weeks ago. I had pre-approved financing at a great rate with my bank for a max balance much higher than I intended to spend. I made it clear from the beginning that I had no interest in dealership financing. I found a vehicle I liked, finished the paperwork given to me at the dealership, coordinated the bank paperwork with the dealership. I thought all was done because I drove away with the vehicle the same day. \n\nAbout two weeks later I go to set up autopay only to discover that my loan is still in the application phase. After speaking with my bank they let me know the dealership has not submitted the required paperwork for fund disbursement and for the loan to finalize. I immediately contact the dealership and get the run around. I texted the salesman and got the same non answers. This continued every few days until today when I finally got someone from my bank to call the dealership and this resulted with only 2/3 of the required forms being submitted. The finance manager refused to speak to us further as \u201che already sent it\u201d and he is apparently the only person able to access those forms. At midnight tonight this loan is void. My bank told me if he doesn\u2019t get the final form in that I\u2019ll need to get reapproved for financing but the rates are higher now. High enough it will price me out of what I can comfortably spend right now. I have neither the time nor the will to shop around for auto loans right now either. My bank said the dealership will just have to take the car back if I don\u2019t want to finance again. \n\nThis just doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. Is this a scam? I will ultimately end up losing thousands of dollars due to the dealership\u2019s negligence. I\u2019m also assuming they will not just take the vehicle back without issue. For what it\u2019s worth, I work with contracts for a living and there is nothing whatsoever that would cover this type of situation in any of the documents from the dealership. To be clear, this loan is only falling through due to the dealership not submitting documents to my bank. \n\nHow can I protect myself in this situation?\n",
