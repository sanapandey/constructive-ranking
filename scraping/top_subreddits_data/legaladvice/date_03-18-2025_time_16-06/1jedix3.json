    "selftext": "I am asking to get advice for my aunt. From what I know she has worked 2 years at this location as an employee and instead of getting a w-2 she got a different form. According to a family member, the form is the one that partners get in co-owning a business. She only got about $17,000 the whole year and had to pay about $1,000 in taxes as well as her fellow coworkers. There was a lady that also paid the same only being there 3-4 months. Additionally, the actual owner only paid about $200. This is the second time my aunt has had to pay this much.\n\nIs there a place to report this? I know other things affect what we pay in taxes but by being only an employ is the w-2 not the form they must get?\n\nIn further speculation, the family member also believes that the tax preparer might have told they owner to do this in order to not pay everything they have to in taxes.\n\nDisclaimer: I heard this second hand several times by different family members so I do not know all the details. Family members have advised her to go to her boss and confront them, go to court or maybe contact IRS and have them look into the business and possibly tax preparer.\n\nUse Location: Texas",
