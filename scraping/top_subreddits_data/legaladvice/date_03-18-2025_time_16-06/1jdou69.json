    "selftext": "Hey guys I could really appreciate some advice here, will try to keep this short. \n\nI 17F, was part of an indoor band program which I recently quit. I got a major concussion in January, this is relevant to the story due to the fact that after I quit the band director posted my doctor\u2019s notes that excused me from rehearsals to the public band photo album, where other members and staff could access it. \nBefore the season started we were made to sign a contract on which we agreed to pay $300 in fees for our participation through the season, the contract didn\u2019t state anything about quitting before the season started, it only stated that you were still required to pay if you were to be kicked out or if you were to quit mid-season. I quit before our first competition even happened, therefore I thought I didn\u2019t have to pay any fees as I\u2019m not a participant anymore, however today I received a notice that I owed the program $300 and was expected to pay as soon as possible. My friends are advising me to sue about the doctor\u2019s note situation, to get the fees dismissed in that way but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s even possible?\n\nWhat should I do in this situation? Sorry if this is hard to understand, I\u2019m stressed about this situation. ",

            "body": "Is the band program connected to a school or school system? If so, I'd escalate to someone higher up there. The doctor's note thing is ridiculous but probably not actionable in the legal sense. But a principal or school board could take action (and should) if they are made aware that an employee/volunteer is allowing the publication of a participant's medical information. Which could also help with the fee issue.",

And my points would be more or less (1) due to medical necessity I had to leave the program (2) I left very early and supplied a doctors note showing that I could no longer participate bc of those medical reasons (3) and I (OP) understand the policy is to pay the $300 fee even if one leaves the program I was hoping an exception could be made in my unique circumstances. Moreover (4) I\u2019m very upset that band director publicly and unprofessionally posted my doctor\u2019s note which caused even further stress and anxiety around this situation\u2026",

Assuming the note had specific information about OP\u2019s medical condition, it was freely released to the band director by OP. \nHowever, if the doctor hypothetically had released the info to the band director without OP\u2019s consent, that might certainly be a HIPAA violation.

Which makes me think that if he is showing oversights here, what else has happened that the principals know about but students don\u2019t?

I\u2019ve seen this a lot in competitive sports. A tournament is paid for based on the number of players, if you back out, the team is still charged and the player can be held responsible. \n\nSo first, find out what the fee is actually for. \n\nSecond, definitely kick someone\u2019s ass about posting your doctor\u2019s note. \n\nGotta do step one first then burn the bridge after you have the info you want. \n\nGood luck.",
