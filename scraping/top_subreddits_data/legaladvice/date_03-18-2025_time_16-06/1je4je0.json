    "selftext": "Sorry if this is the wrong place, if it is, please let me know. \n\nDad Location: California\nMe Location: East Coast\n\nMy dad (61) lives in California, and I live on the East Coast. He and I are basically estranged, he was not a good dad, and he has effectively burned every single bridge in his life. \n\nHis last friend reached out to me to let me know that Dad is in a bad way. He is living in this friend's house, because Friend felt bad for him. He told me Dad was basically homeless otherwise. During that time, Friend learned, in an unfortunate series of events, that dad is incontinent, urinates and poops everywhere, wanders around the house aimlessly at random times, forgets things, and keeps losing his money. Dad is also diabetic, and refuses to take his insulin, refuses to see a doctor, and eats very little.\n\nFriend asked me to help, but I genuinely was at a complete loss. While Dad is not my responsibility, there is obviously something very very wrong with him. I have been on the phone for countless hours with various organizations, and eventually called APS. But APS has so far helped Friend and I very little. We aren't sure what to expect from them, but we know he needs to be evaluated... because I'm not even sure he is even \"there\". \n\nBut if he refuses treatment, then what do we realistically do? \n\nI cannot take him. I don't have a lot of money, he was abusive to me, and I live very far away. Friend has to eventually kick him out, too, because he's wrecking Friend's house. I don't like the man, but I don't want him to die from something completely treatable. ",

Getting your father the help he needs is going to take a lot of effort and in order for you to properly advocate for him, you\u2019ll likely need to be present. From 3000 miles away it\u2019s damn near impossible (also assuming you have a job and a family of your own). \n\nWhat will likely happen is your father will have a medical event, especially with unchecked diabetes. He\u2019ll get admitted to the hospital and he will be stabilized. Then it will come out that he\u2019s homeless, has no money, no health coverage, no family, and that he can\u2019t care for himself. Also , by not going to the doctor for years, a few other medical problems will show up as it\u2019s common for one problem to snowball into a dozen others (diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease, a stroke that was missed, dementia, heart failure, etc ). He\u2019ll be assigned a case manager who, if they\u2019re diligent, will find you, update you to the situation, and then start working on finding a nursing home for your father as he will not be a safe discharge otherwise. \n\nI\u2019m sorry to be so grim but it happens all the time. I\u2019m a critical care nurse who\u2019s seen this pattern a hundred times over. Unfortunately there\u2019s not a lot of good options and he could end up a ward of the state. Sorry you\u2019re in this situation.\n\nEdit: seeing a lot of people saying that the guy your dad lives with should just drop him at an Emergency Department and let them sort it out.OP this is bad advice. Unless he\u2019s actually sick he won\u2019t be admitted and will be stuck in the ED which has severely limited options for a guy like your dad. His time in the ED will be wildly upsetting to him and will worsen his mental state especially if has dementia. He could end up being g discharged to a homeless shelter and he will do absolutely terrible there.\n\nFolks, I\u2019m sorry but dementia and incontinence is not an emergency and alone will not get you admitted to a hospital. emergency departments are for medical emergencies (I can\u2019t breath / I was shot / my heart has stopped) and are not equipped to deal with situations like OP.",

            "body": "If your dad won't willingly go see a Doctor then you may need to force the situation with APS before his Friend has to kick him out. \n\nIt's unfortunate, but it's your dad's life choices that have gotten him where he is. You aren't going to change that. \n\nDo what you can, but ultimately realize he is an adult and is making his own decisions. You can't be responsible for cleaning up after his messes that he chose to put himself in. \n\nI would definitely mention the incontinence and possible dementia to APS and ask for that Welfare check. Also, his Friend chose to take him him and you can't be responsible for that either, though your dad is lucky he seems to have one friend who cares about him.\n\nIf APS won't show up, make a plan with your dad's Friend to get him to the ER. Severe incontinence can be caused by a myriad of health issues. And if he is mentally incompetent a social worker will get involved. It won't be perfect, but at least you can get some Professionals involved bc this is way beyond you or your dad's Friend to handle.",
