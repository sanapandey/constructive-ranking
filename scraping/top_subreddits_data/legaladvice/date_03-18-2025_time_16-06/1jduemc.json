    "selftext": "Upon checking into an airport hotel next to O'Hare in Chicago, the hotel receptionist refused entry until I upgraded to TWO beds instead of ONE. He even stated \"if it was a man and woman, one bed would be fine, but I cannot allow to men to sleep in the same bed\". I had to pay $20 extra for two beds after he refused a total refund of the one night rate I had already paid. \n\nI am angry, humiliated, and traumatized. I know this is light discrimination but man does it feel terrible. I understand so much more about the injustices in my country and the world now just with this tiny civil violation. My entire sense of safety is totally in question after this tiny incident.\n\nAfter researching, I see that this hotel has broken the law. What can I do? What should I do? Am I legally entitled to anything to make this right? This is a small hotel chain with several hotels across the Midwest. \n\n  \nUse Location: Illinois (But I live in Ohio)",

Sexual orientation is a protected class in the Act. \n\nThe Act defines sexual orientation as \"actual or perceived heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, or gender-related identity, whether or not traditionally associated with the person's designated sex at birth. 'Sexual orientation' does not include physical or sexual attraction to a minor by an adult.\"\u00a0\n\nIf you believe you may have been discriminated against on the basis of sexual orientation, you may file a charge with IDHR. It may also be possible to file a charge with the municipality where the discrimination occurred, if the municipality has an ordinance prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination.",

Out of curiosity had you booked a room for two people or did you have a booking for a rate for one person?  I know you say the guy said man and woman would be fine, but he may deny saying that  and claim this was all a big mixup over you having two people at check in and a reservation for one person. Normally the 1 or 2 person thing doesn\u2019t matter at American chain hotels though.\n\nIn any event, you can file a complaint with the Illinois Human Rights Commission.
