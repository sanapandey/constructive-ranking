    "selftext": "For some background info: I 25F, was molested as a child by my mom's boyfriend for a few years. This happened in Georgia. He also molested my older sister and younger brother. My sister told my dad what was happening to her, and the police did an investigation. My mother defended him, and me and my brother were unable to be honest with the police, so the case was dropped. As a step in my healing process, I decided to make a post on facebook (which I never use and all my friends on there are people from the small town I grew up in). The post just stated what happened to me and my siblings, included his full name, and that I wanted to make the town aware so that this wouldn't happen to any more children. I used the words \"molest\" and \"pedophile.\" The response was immediate and was 100% supportive. People began messaging me and talking to me about different experiences with him. None were crimes, but they were all creepy and concerning situations involving children. His own sister and niece messaged me and told me they believed me. His sister actually later called the elementary school at which his great-nephew attends and told them that he's a pedophile and is not allowed around her grandson). I made this post a little over a month ago. On friday, my sister and I received a packet in the mail from a lawyer representing my mom's ex. We are being accused of defamation. All my sister did was share my post. Apparently, he has also filed a police report. The letter also states, \"Your allegations were investigated on ........ 2007 by investigator ......... and case worker ........... The investigation concluded that the claims were unfounded...\"\n\nFun fact, I never alleged anything. How can my claims be proven unfounded if I never claimed anything. They even included pictures of the entire police report which names me as \"Sister of the accuser.\" Like did this lawyer even read it?\n\nIt says that me and my sister both have to make apology posts on facebook. The lawyer wrote a hilarious script that he wants us to use. It's insanely long and literally includes: Upon further reflection and verification, I have come to realize that my statement was inaccurate and misleading. It's a full retraction and apology and apology of the claims and sounds like it was written by chatgpt. His client also threatens to seek Punitive, general and compensatory damages along with attorney fees and costs. If me and my sister want to avoid litigation, we must delete the initial post and make the retraction statement. And we have to send a response in writing by this Friday March 21st.\n\nI'll make something clear. There isn't a singular reality where me or my sister makes that post retracting the allegation. If anything, I want to double down and make a second post. I'm afraid that if I immediately respond via lawyer that it'll scare off his attorney.\n\nMy ultimate goal here is to counter-sue him. Me, my sister, and the molester all live in different states. I'm in NC and she's in FL. What should I do next? My brother and sister both confirmed that they would be happy to go on the stand and recount what happened in court. I'm also quite sure that there are many other people who would as well. (Specifically, his sister and niece who don't let him around his great-nephew, my older cousin who lived with us at the time and confronted the molester when he came over to the house while my mom wasn't home to \"cuddle\" with us. My cousin new nothing at the time but obviously knew that was weird as hell. The confrontation that ensued was apparently very intense.)\n\nAnyway, I'm a bit overwhelmed and would really love to hear from someone who knows more about this.\n\nEDIT: Since the post is now locked, I would like to clarify a few things.\n\nOne: Of course I'm going to find a lawyer, I felt like that was so obvious that there was no need to add it.\n\nTwo, the \"investigation\" was not a real investigation. There's a specific thread of comments that are very loud and very wrong. I can't reply to ya'll directly, so I'll do it here.\n\nYou assume I'm stupid for assuming I could possibly win the case because \"These are the same testimonies that weren't found credible on a police investigation, not newly found witnesses or testimonies that were ignored the first time.\"\n\nEvery single thing you said is actually 100% wrong. The testimonies of his sister, niece, and my cousin were not a part of the police investigation. They are quite literally newly found witnesses that WERE ignored the first time. It amazes me the faith that some of you have in the legal system. Do you know how I was involved in the investigation? Some cops came to my house, took me outside, and asked me \"when he touches you, is it a good touch, or a bad touch?\" And because I didn't want to get in trouble, I said \"in-between.\" And then the police left and never spoke to me again. That's it.\n\nThree: When I said I never alleged anything, I thought it was obvious that I was referring to in the past, in reference to the original investigation of my sister's claims. But I see this caused some confusion. I'm saying the letter from the lawyer specifically says \"He was cleared of YOUR allegations in 2007.\" He was not cleared of MY allegations in 2007 because I didn't make any allegations until February 2025! He was only cleared of my Sister's allegations.",
