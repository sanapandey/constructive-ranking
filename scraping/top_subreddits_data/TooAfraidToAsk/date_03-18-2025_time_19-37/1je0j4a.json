That completely sucks and would absolutely feel hurtful to receive. \n\nWith parenting friends for sure there have been times we\u2019ve had plans that have turned into, actually can you come and help out with kiddo because I\u2019m running on empty and I\u2019ve been happy to go help out instead of doing what we planned. \n\nEqually I do always say to my friends. Please don\u2019t feel guilty about saying you don\u2019t have the mental capacity to do what we planned. I\u2019d much rather you were honest than felt the need to lie. As a result people tend to be more honest about it with me. One friend cancelled a walk we were planning to take 3 weeks running. On the third week I just turned up with a care package for her because she was clearly struggling and I didn\u2019t want to feel like an extra burden and wanted her to know she was cared about even if she couldn\u2019t make plans. \n\nYou\u2019re right, you absolutely deserve a kinder message to cancel on plans and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve experienced people cancelling in an unkind way. That\u2019s shitty to do to someone whether you have kids or not. \n\nI hope you\u2019ve found friends that are able to communicate with you in a kinder manner!",

Doesn't add up with nap time and I need a nap too? If I am too embarrassed to tell the truth or excuse myself not mentioning a reason at all, I am doing what I promised to do. But usually honesty is the best bet. \n\nI was raised by a family who didn't care about the truth or honesty. They cared about saying the best thing in the moment. The thing that would get you least in trouble, make least stress, would sound best. Also within the family. White lies were standard. It took me years and years to overcome the automated impulse to lie and make up a reason for anything, even if the actual reason would be pretty good. Like, if I am sick with the flu, my guts would tell me to say I am sick with good poisoning. Just - never tell the truth, the truth is good enough, it can't possibly be. \n\nSo I am now rather committed to saying the truth, this includes not lying by omission either. It is important to me and I want to show my kid that you can be an honest person without being a \"brutally honest\" asshole, and that honesty pays off.",
