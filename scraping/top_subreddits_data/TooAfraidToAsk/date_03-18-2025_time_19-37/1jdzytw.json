Russian ruble is not in complete dumpster because of strict capital controls and forced conversion to ruble for many exporting companies. The ruble trading volume has crashed. Much of the oil they are selling, they are selling for currency that they cant spend, for example Indian rupees, they don't have nearly as much goods that they buy from India as the value of oil they sell to them. Sanctions don't prevent them from acquiring goods, instead they pay much higher premium. You can buy an Iphone, but you pay much more, because now you have 3 more intermediaries for a product. When you hear the news of Russian economy growth, guess what, your country can also be made to jump more than 10% in a year, if the country suddenly pumps money into industries, but when you run out of money, you eat shit, and currently they are very close to being out of liquid assets. The economic growth has been almost exclusively in military sector, the civilian sector is in deep shit, and has been in deep shit for a while. If you understand what 2% or less than 2% unemployment means, then you know that lower does not mean better. They are extremely low on workers, and on top of this, as the government is putting money in military industrial sector and recruitment bonuses, just have a thought how this could affect the civil sector. With the high interest rates and the outcompeting wages for military sector, the civil sector is closing down businesses simply because they dont have the workers, as they cant keep up with the wages in civil sector. And even with the high interest rates their inflation is extreme. \n\nAnother thing you must understand about Russia: there is Moscow/St. Petersburg and the rest. For practical purposes, they are 2 completely different countries. If you see some influencer from Russia, showing: \"What sanctions? Look at these products in these stores!\" Pay attention to the city, pay attention to the price, and check what it was 4 years ago there. \n\nBut hey, a clickbait media, for the low attention span westerner just goes like: \"Russian GDP number go up, sanctions don't work.\" Not that I think that media is deliberately misleading, rather when you check much of the editors, they are people who write posts that get clicks, essentially media is just influencers, not people who are specialized in economics or military. I mean, if any of you have some sort of specialization, you very well know how braindead and generalized to being useless the media is at covering the topics that cover your specialization. I mean, hell, even \\~2 years ago, one of the news articles was saying something like \"Russia gains a TACTICAL victory in some region!\" A TACTICAL fucking victory! If the editor had shit for brains about whatever he was writing about, he would understand that \"tactical\" victory in military nomenclature is essentially a small scale/local advance. Its not some media conspiracy, its just that people who write these articles should stay on writing astrology and celebrity gossip nonsense.\n\nTo wrap up, no, Russia is not doing fucking well. Sanctions work, and never they have been an instant kill switch. No Russia will not collapse tomorrow either. (There is just the same issue in media of inept morons making articles about \"Russian collapse is imminent\" too) Russia had stored a lot of reserves, as they got a lesson from 2014, but at this moment it is close to being exhausted. The county is not going to die, but surely, its harder to work when you have fever of 39C and rising. And to do your own reality check, just go and check the territorial changes since start of 2024, from when all you hear is that Russia advances/takes over this or that village, go and zoom out the Ukraine map, and compare the territorial changes. Tell me, do you really see a massive Russian breakthrough there or not, without zooming in.",

There will always be buyers for raw materials if the price is low enough because the only thing that matters for commodities is price. Nobody wants to cut off Russian ressources from the world market because that would mean steep price hikes for all kinds of raw materials, which would hurt especially Europe and the US and it would allow Russia to make as much profit as before or even more by just trading a tiny fraction of the previously traded amounts. \n\nThat's why e.g. there is a price cap for Russian oil, to still make the Russian sell their oil but to hit their profits. This tactics was extremely successful, there was a very large price discount on Russian oil for several years and it meant that many billions of USD lost for Russia. It was also a very asymmetrical sanction, since it didn't cost the West much except some lost revenue for shipping insurances but Russia had to build up a shadow tanker fleet at skyhigh purchase prices and way higher operating costs and pay higher insurance rates but will get less money for its oil.

Not anymore. China and India know Russia doesn't have any other buyers, and are taking advantage of it. Heck even Saudi Arabia started buying Russian oil because it was cheaper than using their own oil to refine.\n\nThey still sell enough to keep everything working.\n\nThe sanctions aren't meant to crash the economy or start a revolution, but rather to decrease the overall economic slice of the pie, to force Russia to make hard decisions on what to fund, to put Russia in the position that they have to make risky plays to keep things working.\n\nRussia built large reserves, but those reserves have been dwindling, not to mention some of it got frozen before they could access it. So now they have to decide to cut spending, raise taxes. They were also cut from swift, and they don't seem to have financial lenders. \n\nThe only one can lend them money at this point is China, but China doesn't want to get too close to Russia because it doesn't want to get sanctioned. Of note is how quickly Western companies pulled out of Russia even without being told to, as a combination of bad PR, consumer pressure, weak rule of law to begin with, very risky and difficult to do business given the war situation. And Western companies have been taking steps to ensure they can do that by outsourcing at least in part to other countries. \n\nAnother factor that tells you their economy isn't too healthy. The Russian Central bank raised interest rates to 20% to prevent inflation from growing out of control and the possible bank runs. Basically, when shit hits the fan, people rush to the banks to withdraw their money. And by creating high interest rates, it motivates people to keep their money in the banks.... but you can't continually raise interest rates forever. So that money will need to be withdrawn at some point. And need to be spent too.",

Meaning theres a good chance that they\u2019re running 50% or more on fueling through production of weapons. The problem with this is you need skilled labor. So this also assumes that not everyone is skilled, so other jobs outside of this are either tightening up labor by cuts or just close all together leaving many without jobs. Remember that consumerism is a staple of a thriving economy. If no one is buying non essential products or even able to afford essential, this will have a drastic effect. After the invasion in \u201822, a lot of western companies closed their doors and drew back investments. The same goes for financial institutions, global trading, and future investments into the country. \nIf the war ends tomorrow with both agreeing to stop the fighting and Russians withdrew from territories, it would most certainly collapse (I don\u2019t know how that would look, but maybe similar to early 90\u2019s post USSR economy shock). \nObviously, there are ways of going around sanctions and companies being boycotted but the long term is very negative.
