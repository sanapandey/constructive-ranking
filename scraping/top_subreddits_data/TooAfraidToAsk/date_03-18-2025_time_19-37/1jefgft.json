    "selftext": "i was talking to a friend recently who was sick and through our discussion i found out that not everyone gets vomit stuck in their nose every time they throw up?!?! i am extremely emetophobic and now realize that this is probably the biggest reason why. i never understood how people felt \"relieved\" after throwing up, because for me throwing up meant that i had to blow out the vomit chunks out of my nose (which made me taste my own vomit and make me nearly hurl all over again) and ALSO deal with a sore throat, which made me feel like i had to hurl every time i tried to swallow my spit/anything. i heard that i should tilt my head up and hold my nose when throwing up to try to prevent the vomity nose, but i still have no clue how to deal w the sore throat (which is a more long lasting problem). so does anybody else deal with this issue or is it just my throat that always gives me problems?(i have had bronchitis NUMEROUS times as a kid)",

I feel like the vomit gets clogged in my throat and nasal cavities, which burns like hell and still lingers after blowing my nose.  \n\nI'm sorry you have to deal with this too. It's gross.  I think that smoking weed/cigs is the issue for me. My ears/chest/nose always feels stuffy, no matter what time of year or how much/little I smoke. \nI should stop smoking.",

I also burst loads of capillaries around my eyes so I ended up with these weird little purple freckle looking things for up to a week after.\n\nI've found standing with my legs straight, bending at the waist and opening my throat as much as possible helps with reducing the throat pain. It's hard to explain but I try to just go with the motions of the gagging and heaving, I don't try and repress or exacerbate them. Try and breathe through it and keep your mouth open and relaxed if you can.\n\nUnfortunately, I've not managed to find a way to stop the vomit blocking up my nose, but a nasal douche with salt water really helps for after.\n\nI hope you can find some relief!",
