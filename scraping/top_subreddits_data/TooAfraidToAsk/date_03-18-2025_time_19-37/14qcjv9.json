I literally posted an unpopular opinion about the latest Disney Princess movies being boring and I offered an explanation. I was extremely respectful, tactful not to talk about politics or anything like that, and it still got deleted. You know why? Because Reddit is a leftist totalitarian app that only allows ideas that are either leftist or neutral. Anything remotely traditional is cutt off not because it's disrespectful or wrong but because the moderators just don't like it. Funny how this is still a \"free\" and \"open\" environment. All it took is for me to state the FACT that tomboy princess movies have all flopped except Mulan, which isn't even a recent movie, and that's because the audience that likes princesses are girly girls and trying to make a tomboy princess is the same as making a girly Spiderman. Wow, I guess the leftist moderators were already shaking by such statements to be public!",
