    "selftext": "\nMy boyfriend gets really turned on by me orgasming (which is sweet, but I am feeling slightly frustrated because I can\u2019t actually finish when we have sex). We have really great sex, it feels absolutely amazing. But right when I\u2019m about to orgasm, he gets very excited/turned on by me and he ejaculates quickly\u2026 and the result is that I cannot finish my orgasm because it all ends so quickly. He always says oh no fuck and that he\u2019s so sorry and I say no, it\u2019s okay don\u2019t worry because I don\u2019t want to make him feel bad.\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure what to do about it though, as I would like to finish from sex. It feels great and he does a lot to get me warmed up prior, he\u2019s not doing anything wrong. He just can\u2019t seem to hold out a little longer. I\u2019ve even tried to make less noise / move a little less while orgasming (which kinda sucks, but I thought it might help\u2014 doesn\u2019t work). Any ideas? Has anyone had this happen before??\n\n\nEDIT: to add YES I have discussed this with my BF and he\u2019s well aware of the problem. I apologize for not making that clearer to begin with. I just don\u2019t want to tell him in feeling frustrated about it because I don\u2019t want him to feel bad. But he\u2019s aware that it\u2019s something we\u2019re working on solving.  We have tried different positions and have tried going a second round after he\u2019s finished to help. \n\nAlso, yes he does give me oral before sex (which is stated in the original post\u2014 I said he warms me up enough and everything else is great but for some reason it wasn\u2019t clear enough.) To add more detail the reason I don\u2019t want to finish there is because once I have finished from oral it's a little too sensitive for me to have sex right away.\nIt feels almost painful it's not comfortable. So l prefer to just get really close then have sex. As I usually can finish from PIV after. And I would if he could hold off a little longer. Lol. He's not doing anything wrong except finishing JUST before I can LOL.\n\nI was just looking for any other ideas to try because what we\u2019ve tried hasn\u2019t worked. Thanks!",

            "body": "I believe you should do the opposite of what the top comment says. Idk who they are, but I am commenting as a man that cums because of my wife\u2019s orgasms, and I\u2019ve had to navigate this problem personally. \n      \nMy wife orgasming is the #1 sexiest thing to me in the world. Nothing will top it, nothing comes close. It is the thing that will make me cum the most reliably, and unfortunately sometimes, the fastest. \n       \nIt\u2019s also important to note that my wife has a slow fuse. She takes a while to warm up, she takes a while to build then tension, and she takes her time getting across the finish line. So to me, it can look like she orgasms 5-6 times, but they weren\u2019t THE ONE. They were hills we climbed over to get to the mountain. Like she will get 80, 85, 90, percent of the way there, then it kind of drops off, we switch something by up, and get to the next hill. When we\u2019re crossing the 97% hill, I\u2019ll be honest, I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING IF THIS IS THE MOUNTAIN. \n       \nThere have been many times where I, unknowingly celebrated climbing a mountain, only to look in her eyes and realize, whoops, the mountain is right next door and this wasn\u2019t it. Shit. Sorry. Then, even though she knows I\u2019m willing to do anything to climb the next mountain with her, the moment just kind of dies and that\u2019s that. I HOPE your bf can recognize this, otherwise you have a different issue to address. \n       \nHowever, if he\u2019s willing and able and invested in helping you enjoy your sexual experience, this is what helped me:\n       \nTell me how close you are. Literally tell me you need 15 more seconds and to not stop what I\u2019m doing. Tell me what you\u2019re feeling. Tell me what you want and how much more of it. TELL ME NOT TO CUM\n       \nIf I\u2019m either getting tired or close and Idk where you are in the process, I have to make a decision: do I take a step back and attempt ruining the moment/mood, or do I cum? Neither one end well for you. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to expect him to know exactly what you\u2019re feeling or to put the responsibility on him to guess or stop and ask. \n        \nI\u2019m going to assume your bf cares about you and wants you to be happy. If that\u2019s the case, PLEASE just be more direct, in the moment, of exactly what you need. It doesn\u2019t take away the sexiness of it. It doesn\u2019t take away the intimacy. Quite the opposite: if you can become comfortable enough to say these things out loud, during sex, you will find a new level of intimacy you don\u2019t know exists yet. \n      \nPS: I know this may be too much or too gross and I\u2019m sorry, but you asked. If you \u201ccan\u201d, helping to nurture or develop a desire or even a fetish for cum could help out on some days. If he\u2019s cumming while you\u2019re at 40%, you\u2019re still SOL. But if you\u2019re at 98% and have built a Pavlovian response to seeing him cum, that could become the booster that gets you across, instead of shuts you down. I think right now that likely seems unrealistic as his cumming is currently pissing you off, just something within your control that could help. \n       \nBest of luck",

Lots of foreplay going and stopping having fun. \n\nBut women's I'm totally into it's much harder. It's like you have the perfect feeling and the perfect woman and it's everything you could ever want... To your mental downfall.. Akin to finding the perfect material to get off on. \n\nTo OP \n\nIf you value the relationship do NOT approach it as being frustrated ect. That will just bring anxiety along with the fact he's totally into you. \n\nIf anything he is already self conscious about it. If he really cares about you he wants you to be pleased as much as himself. Some things that help is quickies saying you just want him off and don't worry about me at all you turn me on getting off takes pressure off the guy and sometimes leads to fantastic sex for both of you. If it doesn't then you say you can get off free but I want all your attention on me next time and work to towards it. If he just can't help it numbing cream or cock rings can help. \n\n\nThe direct I just need x amount of time does help a LOT if your close. A lot of the time we can't gauge where you are or what you want to accomplish. Being direct stops the in about to cum and he suddenly stops to hold it to keep going and you get irritated. Sometimes you may want to get off feeling this at x time and others you may just be enjoying and wanting to go longer. For the guy he's pondering well should I back off to go longer or should I just go crazy and try to get off at the same time? \n\nIf your saying go hard for 30 and I'm all yours it takes pressure off and he will go nuts to accomplish it knowing your close and not guessing.",

Or rub your clit yourself before he pulls out.\n\nAnd the last thing would be well if you still have an orgasm and he's done tell him to stroke you with his hands or something if he doesn't want to put his mouth down there depending on if he has cum inside. Some guys won't like that.  Or you could have a dildo handy if he does come and he can't pleasure you with his dick anymore tell him to use the dildo until you come. He's going to love that image in his head for later spank bank material. \n\nEither way make your pleasure a priority here and find ways to orgasm even if you're trying to be nice to him I'll tell you what I spent too many years not putting my own pleasure  as important as theirs, and good Men absolutely want you to get off so you're not being selfish trust me they enjoy it when you do, even if it's after them..  it's a sense of pride and accomplishment.. there have been times where I felt like I had to keep going for four five orgasms long passed when my husband was done and I thought I was really irritating because I kept wanting to go more, (I had the help  of toys) well turns out he was pretty darn proud of himself LOL and he'd thought about it for days after and was hungry for more.",

I said I didn\u2019t want to make him feel bad which made everyone think I was afraid to discuss it. But I have discussed it. It\u2019s just what we\u2019ve tried hasn\u2019t worked so I figured I\u2019d ask others. \n\nI like the toy idea! I actually ordered one the other day. It hasn\u2019t arrived yet, but fingers crossed it helps. Unfortunately it seems like the physical act of my finishing is what triggers him so I\u2019m not sure if it will help. It doesn\u2019t seem to be a time/ lasting long issue. Maybe over time it\u2019ll get better. He hasn\u2019t had a lot of sexual experience. He definitely satisfies me in every other way (including with oral sex). It\u2019s just in this specific way that I\u2019m feeling frustrated and would love to have a solution. It\u2019s not a deal breaker. Just would love to be able to figure it out at some point!",
