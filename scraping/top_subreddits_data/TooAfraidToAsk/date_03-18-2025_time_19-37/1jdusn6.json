They claim to be all about free speech and stuff, but then have the most restrictive subreddits around when it comes to even simply what SIDE you're allowed to be on when posting/commenting.  \n\nI get that on some level its their way of combating Reddit's left-leaning bias (i.e. if you just let anyone comment, it would be hard to keep a right-wing subreddit alive when a good chunk of the comments/posts might end up being from liberals ,  but how does it NOT feel like an echo chamber when you create rules which basically require it to be one?",

Unlike other subs that are restrictive to keep content on track or create safe spaces for people to freely express their opinions conservative subs are mostly just angry that they're on the wrong side of the tolerance paradox. \n\nWhen they say \"echo chamber\" what they really mean is \"I said a bad thing and people are meanies and bullies that won't let me say it.\" They aren't protecting the sanctity of anything other than their ideology. Which is why they can never explain what they're actually doing.\n\nIt's completely disingenuous. They use all the right words in all the wrong ways. And they completely believe in it.

The conversation was around how they were going to get young children cancer-causing conversion therapy drugs that would sterilize them without the parents, knowing or consent. \n\nI mean these people were openly encouraging the idea of posing as parents to pick up children from elementary school so they can inject them with hormones before dropping them off around the corner from where they live .

The proof of this is the fact Trump was re-elected with historic approval ratings while democrats have historic disapproval ratings.\n\nListen to yourself for just one minute bro. The proof you have for Trump being voted in was because you were *banned from several liberal groups*? Lol come on man.\n\nNo doubt both parties are lobbied by big business. One side (R) goes wayyy beyond the other (D), by giving the rich MEGA tax cuts and deregulation to fuck over their workers and the country as a whole. The only dangerous censorship I see is from the Trump party and their followers. As for obsessed with war? Again, both sides are guilty of this to an extent. America's wealth and GDP is built on war, and their influence is built on their ability to project their soft and hard power. However, whilst one side (D) is pro NATO, backing the long standing allies of the free world - the other (R) is trying to dismantle that, backing only dictatorships and threatening long standing allies with invasion, with every move seemingly for the benefit of a certain V Put1n (or ch1na)\n\nIt's like moaning about a dry, stale sandwich - when the *only other option* is a rotting, stinking shit sandwich. God knows the democrats have their issues. But come on bro, we have a wannabe dictator, russ1an puppet in the white house now. ***Get your priorities in order!*** The reason the democrats didn't get in was not because you got banned, it was because of:\n \n1. Propaganda\n2. The Democrat was a black female\n\nDon't try and pretend it was anything other.",
