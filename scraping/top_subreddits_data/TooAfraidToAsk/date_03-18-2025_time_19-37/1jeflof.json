Is there anything specific I can do to help quell her fears besides just like, the usual niceties or something? I\u2019m not exactly experienced in dating, so I\u2019m sorry for how stupid this question probably sounds. ",

She likely has anxiety from a pattern of behaviours in her past that formed how she reacts to situations. Again, as refugefirstmate said, she needs treatment from a licensed professional to work through this. Keep doing what you are doing but be sure it\u2019s not infringing on your own mental health. Boundaries are healthy.",

Gently but firmly set boundaries so that if things start to go south (as they will in even the healthiest relationship) neither of you gets lost in trying to hold onto yourselves and regain balance. You can't force someone to trust you, but you can create a solid foundation for trust to grow.",

It's really exhausting to feel so shitty all the time. Therapy was incredibly helpful, specifically CBT. One of the tools I learned is to look for evidence that either confirms or rebuts what my brain is telling me. My brain is a lying sack of shit. People like me. People LOVE me! You can't be her therapist, but you can look for ways to tell and show her you love her. A variety of ways keeps it from feeling performative. Like, one day put a sticky on the shower that says you love her. Another day send a random text saying you're thinking of her and miss her. Bring flowers one day just because. Etc etc etc. And strongly suggest she find a therapist.",

Don't treat dating in highschool too seriously, this isn't going to be your partner for life most likely so if I were you I'd honestly crap out now and go find someone who will appreciate your love. I promise you that you will be going above and beyond for this girl at 150% and will only get a \"you don't really love me\" or \"I'm not good enough for you.\" It's fucking exhausting. Eventually she will self-sabotage your relationship by cheating on you because \"she doesn't deserve you\" in her young teen mind it's exactly what she thinks or you're going to end up cheating on her because you're sick and tired of being underappreciated. Either way if she doesn't get help with her problems it's only going to end in sour feelings on both sides.",
