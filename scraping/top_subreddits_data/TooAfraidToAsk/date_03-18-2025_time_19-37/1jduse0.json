    "selftext": "I\u2019ve seen multiple videos of cops who get one foot in the door of a suspect/citizen without having a warrant. It always turns into a standoff where the cop can\u2019t enter more but the homeowner also can\u2019t slam the door. Why can\u2019t the citizen just slam the door on their foot or use pepper spray to get them out of the house? It seems like one foot in the door is not the same as illegally entering? ",

If it's cops, I kick the stop into place. \n\nTHAT said, if they do not have a warrant,  you are not required to speak to them at all unless they meet on of the 3 requirements for warrantless entry. \n\n1. Welfare check on someone in the house. But they must be able to name the person. It can't be a generic check. Then you MUST produce that person for them to speak to outside. \n\n2. Visible evidence of a crime. Even visible through a window counts. Like a pipe in the coffee table \n\n3. Chasing a fleeing suspect who was seen entering the house. \n\nCheck out the several great lawyers in YouTube.\nThe Civil Rights Attorney\nLegal Eagle\nAnd others.",

Connor (U.S. Supreme Court, 1989):** This landmark decision established that claims of excessive force by law enforcement should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment's \"objective reasonableness\" standard. The Court emphasized evaluating the reasonableness of force from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, considering factors like the severity of the crime, immediate threats to safety, and whether the suspect is resisting or attempting to flee. \u200b[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_v._Connor)\n* **Resisting Unlawful Arrest:** The traditional common law rule permitted individuals to resist unlawful arrests. However, modern statutes in many states have abrogated this right, prohibiting resistance even to unlawful arrests, except when officers employ excessive force. For instance, some jurisdictions allow self-defense claims when an officer uses force likely to cause great bodily harm or death.",

Assuming we're talking about the US, my understanding of legal theory is that the same self-defense laws apply to cops acting outside the law as they do to civilians, and there is some legal precedent to support this. So depending on local laws, using force to defend your residence may be justified. \n\nBut that's the theory. As a practical matter a cop willing to break the law to try to get into your place isn't likely to respect your right to defend yourself. Even if they don't have a warrant, they can enter if there are extenuating circumstances. And they will be sure that that their report indicates that those circumstances exist. You'll have a dozen officers, who may or may not have been on scene at the time, testifying that they heard someone inside screaming for help. Or maybe they got an \"anonymous tip\". Or maybe they were executing a search warrant but somehow accidentally went to your place when they were intending to go somewhere on the other side of town (which would be legal under qualified immunity).\n\nIf you injure a cop, they'll bust down your door and kick the shit out of you because you were \"resisting\". Then on the way to the police car you'll \"trip\" a few times smacking your face against the door frame, and the sidewalk, and the roof of the car. And when you get to the jail, you'll \"slip\" down the stairs, then \"slip\" back up the stairs, then \"slip\" down the stairs again. Once you're locked up, you will inexplicably \"refuse\" any food, water, or medical attention.\n\nWhat's legal and what actually happens are two completely different issues. You might be found innocent in court, but very few people are willing to take that risk.",

            "body": "Even if a cop is doing something illegal like entering your home without a warrant or arresting you without cause, you are not legally allowed to use any type of force against them and if you do, you\u2019re now guilty of breaking the law by resisting arrest or assaulting an officer, even if it\u2019s an illegal arrest.\n\nThe way you\u2019re supposed to deal with a situation like that is using the illegal search/entry or illegal arrest against the cops in court to get evidence resulting from those illegal actions excluded from the trial. And also potentially by suing the police department or municipality over your rights being violated if you want to make them think twice about the behavior and levy some type of punitive action against the cops/municipality and hopefully recover some damages.\n\nBasically, you can never legally resist or assault cops, even if you think or know they\u2019re doing something wrong. Your only legal remedy is to go along with it in the moment while verbally informing them you don\u2019t consent to searches/entry and then seek legal remedies later after it\u2019s all over in the court system.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to assault a cop then you better make sure they have no idea you\u2019re the one who assaulted them and have no way of figuring it out. You cannot harm them legally under any circumstances.",

In my state (Indiana), they passed laws giving a little leeway to people who resist cops entering their home, particularly when they dont know it is a cop, after someone used lethal force to resist what they thought was an intruder, but turned out to be a cop. The courts ruled in the cop's favor, the legislature passed a law to correct that. It doesnt solve the problem that if you resist a cop, even if you dont know they are a cop, they will probably injure or kill you in the process. I dont think that would cover when you know it is a cop though. \n\nGenerally, if a cop is violating your rights, you are expected to go along with it and seek remedy in the courts. I think the only exceptions, unless told otherwise, would be if you are going to suffer irreparable harm, IE, you are literally fighting for your life or you are intervening to prevent something from being destroyed that cant be replaced. No matter what, you should expect to go to jail in the best case and end up dead in the worst.",
