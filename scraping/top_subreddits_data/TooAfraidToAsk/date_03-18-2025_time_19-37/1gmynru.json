But I feel something is getting lost here. If there is tariff, wouldn\u2019t the importer be able to negotiate the price down at the manufacturer? In essence then China is paying the tariff right? Wouldn\u2019t it eventually come down to the bargaining power of the importer? If yes, then US definitely has the bargaining power as a major consumer for everything ever made everywhere no? Also, tariff on Chinese goods may help rebalance the imports to Vietnam or Mexico and thereby bringing more bargaining power to the importer?",

                    "body": "> Wouldn\u2019t it eventually come down to the bargaining power of the importer?\n\nYes, and no. It comes down to the bargaining power of the importer, but if the importer had bargaining power after the tariff, odds are it had similar bargaining power before the tariff.\n\n> If there is tariff, wouldn\u2019t the importer be able to negotiate the price down at the manufacturer?\n\nOnly if the manufacturer is willing (or able) to eat the cost.\n\nTo use a very simplified example, lets say a widget costs $9 to make, and the manufacturer sells it for $10. It's profit margin is $1 per widget. They will be cheaper than a domestic manufacturer that makes widgets for $14, and sells them for $15.\n\nThen it gets hit with a 50% tariff. It cannot eat a 50% cost, that would blow through their $1 profit margin. It could, at most, eat $0.99, the rest of the cost of the tariff has to get passed on or they would lose money. And realistically, it probably can't even eat that. If it could eat that, it would already be selling it's widgets for $9.01. They need some amount of margin. It doesn't matter how big the importer is, they can only eat so much cost.\n\nIn some hypothetical, if a company was making widgets for $9, and selling them for $25, it might be able to eat the 50% tariff. But that would require it to have the market to be able to sell for those kinds of margins, despite other competition (in China, in other countries, or in the US).\n\nAreas where tariffs can be successful are things like solar panels, which are heavily subsidized by the Chinese government, so they can be sold artificially cheaply. A tariff that bumps them up to a \"normal\" price can be fine.",

Please read the entire post before commenting, as the context of BOTH scenarios is important. I do not hate trans people, or anyone else of that community.

They're a coworker, obviously a bear of a guy but they want to be called \"she/her\". It feels like their baiting people to misgender them sometimes. They're extremely awkward to be around. They are sensitive about their gender and it makes it really stressful to talk to them. They are constantly sending complaints about customers calling them sir as if they should just know they're a ma'am, walking out on shifts because of it, or launching into long gossip rants about how transphobic our uni is to is to us. We treat her cordially and try not to misgender her, but it always feels like we're one misstep away from being verbally accosted. She's since been fired but still visits our cafe to chat with us, or show us pictures of her in makeup. I personally don't think they look... good, not because of any inherit transphobia, but because sis just DOES NOT know how to contour. I'm so scared to speak up or give advice because of her outburst and quickness to attribute anything to transphobia.\n\nOn the flipside, I have a friend online I've known for years who is (was) a guy but likes to be called \"she/her\" recently. She puts a lot of effort into presenting as her target gender, respects that some people won't recognize it, and is very patient with others (like me) who accidentally slip into the habit of calling her \"he\". It's honestly been really nice seeing her transition and feel more comfortable, and the way she can joke about it brings levity to what is otherwise an awkward and tense subject.\n\nWhich are trans people actually like?

I know Reddit's collective conscience is going hysterical six ways to Sunday, but I ask you to slow down, breathe, and let the actual subject matter experts be the voices here. Out of curiosity, I posit the following fictional scenario:\n\nImagine there is a parallel earth very similar to ours right now. On this fictitious earth, in its similar-but-not-exactly-the-same-United States of America, election fraud is proven. Say on February 18th at 2pm, a court with appropriate jurisdiction finds that the 2024 US Presidential election was manipulated. The evidence is indisputable, the findings accepted. Assume that all concerned parties cooperate fully once the court\u2019s findings are published. What would happen next?\n\nDo they hold another election? Does the Speaker of the House get sworn in? Is there any legal precedent for this?\n\nRemember that this is all theoretical, and not worth getting worked up about. Thank you!",

            "body": "This is more of a thought experiment, but I\u2019ve been considering the possibility: \n\nCould mass deportations under Trump (or any administration) be a deliberate strategy to provoke civil unrest as an underhanded way to entrap protestors into acting in ways that suspend their rights to habeas corpus?\n\nHere\u2019s the reasoning:\n\t1.\tMass Deportations as a Trigger:\nGovernments often use fear and division to consolidate power. Targeting vulnerable groups can create social tension, which may escalate into protests\u2014or even riots. The key is that authorities decide what qualifies as a \u201criot,\u201d giving them broad discretion to respond forcefully.\n\t2.\tThe Hidden Legal Mechanism \u2013 Suspension of Habeas Corpus:\nMost people don\u2019t realize this, but the U.S. Constitution allows for the suspension of habeas corpus\u2014your right to challenge unlawful detention\u2014under extreme conditions like rebellion or invasion (Article I, Section 9, Clause 2).\n\nHere\u2019s the critical part:\n\t\u2022\tInciting a Riot (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101): If officials declare that your actions are part of a riot\u2014or even inciting one\u2014that can escalate into a legal gray area where extreme measures are justified.\n\t\u2022\tIn chaotic situations, this determination is made in real time by officials or political leaders, not necessarily through formal court rulings.\n\nIf civil unrest grows\u2014or is simply framed as a rebellion\u2014habeas corpus can be suspended, meaning people can be detained indefinitely without the right to challenge their detention.\n\t3.\tJanuary 6th as a Possible Test Run:\nThink about January 6, 2021:\n\n\t\u2022\tIt was quickly labeled an insurrection, leading to mass arrests and legal actions that bypassed the usual slow judicial process.\n\t\u2022\tThis event showed how fast the government can react to civil unrest with sweeping authority\u2014and how easy it is to justify harsh measures when the public is afraid.\n\nCould January 6th have been a \u201ctest run\u201d to gauge how the public, law enforcement, and legal systems respond to domestic unrest? And if so, what happens when the next trigger isn\u2019t a one-day event but a nationwide wave of protests over something like mass deportations?\n\t4.\tThe Authoritarian Playbook:\nAuthoritarian regimes often manufacture crises to justify expanding their power. By provoking conflict, they create the conditions needed to suspend civil liberties under the guise of maintaining order.\n\t5.\tPublic Desensitization:\nThe more we witness aggressive crackdowns, the more it becomes normalized. Over time, people stop questioning whether these actions are constitutional because they\u2019ve been conditioned to accept them as \u201cnecessary for security.\u201d\n\nTL;DR:\n\nMass deportations could provoke civil unrest, which officials can label as riots or even rebellions. Under the Suspension Clause of the Constitution, this allows for the suspension of habeas corpus\u2014meaning people can be detained indefinitely without the right to challenge it in court. This legal mechanism is obscure, and most people don\u2019t realize how easily it can be triggered. Events like January 6th may have been a \u201ctest run\u201d to see how quickly the government can justify extreme measures in response to domestic unrest.\n\nMass deportations could provoke civil unrest, which officials can label as riots or even rebellions.

Ableism? Remember the reporter he made fun of? Homophobia, together with Transphobia? Huge points for him. Anti-Communism?

Once this rumor gained a lot of traction online, Trump mentioned it during a campaign rally, making it a mainstream story.  \n\nThis is a similar pattern to the whole story with immigrants (falsely) being accused of eating dogs and cats in Ohio, where a rumor spread online before getting repeated by people in the Trump campaign.\n\nBasically, this doesn't appear to be a weird marketing campaign planned by McDonald's or a controversy about something Harris was emphasizing.

            "body": "Over the last few days, the report that Trump has been recruited as [\"Krasnov\" in late 80s](https://m.economictimes.com/magazines/panache/was-donald-trump-a-russian-spy-in-1987-bizarre-allegations-by-ex-kgb-officer-will-surprise-you/articleshow/118487146.cms)\u00a0 \u00a0had me connect a few peculiar dots and I'm at a point where I'm not sure if it's all sensible or if I'm devolving into a conspiracy-fuelled fever dream. Do let me know if I'm making sense.\n\n\nFirst off, let's consider the following:\n\n\n- first off, the [report](https://m.economictimes.com/magazines/panache/was-donald-trump-a-russian-spy-in-1987-bizarre-allegations-by-ex-kgb-officer-will-surprise-you/articleshow/118487146.cms) I've linked before.\n\n\n- second, this happened well before [Fred Trump's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump) death, meaning financial leverage is unlikely. I also don't see Donnie as caring very much for anyone but himself, and manipulating a celebrity like that throughout multiple decades with a hostage doesn't sound like it would be easy to keep under wraps. Definitely not as much so as classic kompromat.\n\n\n- Trump has famously stated he could shoot someone in the middle of 5th avenue and lose no voters. This is probably something of a hyperbole, but I genuinely don't think having him implicated in murder like that would be the end of his political career. With the amount of support Trump seems to be giving Russia, if he is kept on a kompromat leash, whatever they have on him must be *truly heinous*.\n\n\n- one of Trump's wives, Ivana, accused him of using [spousal rape as a tool of dominance](https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/20/donald-trump-biopic-the-apprentice-ali-abbasi-cannes). This is relevant, as [some studies](https://smart.ojp.gov/somapi/chapter-2-etiology-adult-sexual-offending) credit approach to sex as a tool of dominance as one of possible drivers of child sexual assault, especially among individuals with a high-dominance, low-nurturance approach. (Talking about Malamuth's Confluence Model in particular, regarding that last link).\n\n\n- Donald Trump has had a number of [sexual misconduct allegations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_sexual_misconduct_allegations#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20has%20been%20accused,room%20in%201995%20or%201996.) levied against him, many quite credible. He has also been known to keep [questionable company](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/trump-jeffrey-epstein-tapes) at times.\n\n\n- as infamous as Donald's comments about Ivanka's looks are, she's also reportedly [using her bedroom voice to manipulate him](https://gregolear.substack.com/p/full-disclosure-an-interview-with). I just want to say, that doesn't seem like a healthy father-daughter relationship.\n\n\n- Ivanka was born in 1981, Trump was reportedly recruited in 1987. This means she was around 6-ish at the time of recruitment.\n\n\nSo, taking all these together, the scenario that comes to mind is that Trump sexually assaulted Ivanka in 1987 as means of \"parental discipline\". KGB either arranged it or was made aware of it and obtained solid proof - likely photos or a recording. This sounds like something heavy enough to sink Trump's career if it leaks and I could see them leveraging this kind of material to keep him obedient.\n\n\nSo I guess what I want to ask, does all this conjecture sound reasonable or am I reaching way too far on this?",

If it were just Democrats messing up, that wouldn't really explain that choice.

They may prefer compromise, but that doesn't mean it's on the table. While any sort of violence would cause harm, politics itself can also be used to cause harm (including violence), so they have to be weighed against each other. And if compromise isn't possible, they may feel like that would lead to less overall harm than the alternative.\n\n\nTo use a silly/extreme example, if person A wants to kill 10 babies, and person B wants to kill 0 babies, there's no compromise for killing any nonzero amount of babies to be had. Of course, it will be subjective on what policies are bad enough to cross that line. Or to use a historical example, we fought WWI/WWII for a reason, instead of waiting for a compromise to end the conflict. While compromise is important, it does require there to be a certain amount of overlap between the two parties, and both parties need to be willing to try for it. It can't happen in a vacuum or unilaterally.\n\nOf course, it's also easy to demonize people you disagree with, especially egged on by people who agree with you. No one is immune from that. That's just human nature. It can also be human nature to want revenge/justice against people you percieve to have wronged you.",

Is that bad?",

If you are valuing the pattern that much, then yes that is bad and not normal.\n\nHowever, I don't really see how Trump winning really matters. If Biden had won, if a republican had won in 2028 it still would've fit the pattern. You're also comparing 2 term presidents (Bush, Clinton, Obama) to 1 term ones.",

Senior was a 1-term president, and the only one in recent history until Trump and now Biden. Although now Trump holds a new (or more recent) trophy for managing a second non-consecutive term. I hope to God, Allah, whoever, that Biden doesn't attempt at his own comeback tour. I will seriously vote write-in at that point. We badly need a maximum age cap on the presidential requirements.

Because, if so, race really isn\u2019t as strong of a determinant for political preferences as socioeconomic status is. \n\nAlthough Black Americans usually lean progressive and vote democratic, many have historically done so because they believe dems have their racial interests at heart more than conservatives do and because dems in the past had better messaging on things like social services and the economy. But that\u2019s been shifting as the years go by. This is evident in this past election for trump. If you look at Black (and even Latino) male voters and how they approached this last election in the USA, more and more are switching over to being republican voters. Men of color are now more than ever turning into swing voters. \n\nWhy? Well, \n\n1) the economy. A lot of Black people just so happen to be poor. Trump\u2019s rhetoric appealed to the ones that voted for him more than dems did. \n\n2) Black people, especially those rooted in a southern Baptist tradition and/or that are not college educated, typically have more traditional views on family life, religion, and identity. These are honestly more in line with centrist (and sometimes conservative) beliefs than they are liberal ones. So, things like trans rights, abortion, etc aren\u2019t top priority voting issues. \n\n3) Dems just have bad branding and i say that as someone who\u2019s voted dem in the last few elections. They need a new PR team asap. Dems haven\u2019t been delivering in a way the people want so they just offer cruel optimism in the form of bandaid policies. \n\nAnyway, I think Kanye should be in a different category as I personally believe some of his politics are just being inflamed by his mental health and familial circumstances. He\u2019s not really one to be looked at as a political figure of any sorts nor should his politics really be something we study. \n\nAnd Caitlyn? Again, gender identity doesn\u2019t supersede socioeconomic status. She outright identifies as  \u201ckind of a Republican\u201d and an \u201ceconomic conservative\u201d (which is a term I have problems with but that\u2019s a whole other post\u2026). \n\nIn general, someone\u2019s social identity is just one part of a larger narrative they write. It doesn\u2019t make up the entirety of how they evaluate life or the world writ large. \n\nWe Americans are rather dumb. We vote against our own self-interests all the time. Why would any of these people be any different?\n\nEdit: grammar",

If someone violent or dangerous crosses the border, the issue is more to do with the violence part, which law enforcement is designed to handle. (Depending on who you talk to, some people still have a role for ICE in taking people handed off by local law enforcement, but not being able to do things like raids itself).\n\nThat said, most people seem to want to reform/limit ICE, rather than abolish it completely.\n\nAlso, some people haven't fully thought it through.

But there is a nonzero risk, and it's not something you want to be caught flat footed on. We've already seen how fast certain norms can fall under pressure. \n\nThere's already discussions of using Guantanamo Bay for immigrants (and previously, things like Jan 6th, etc), for instance. Something that would've been laughed at as impossible a week or two ago. Trump's prior administration also already had it's fair share of right's abuses, as well.\n\nFor perspective, people also confidently downplayed what was happening in Germany at the time. For one example, you can read a 1922 NYTimes [article](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/11/21/98786796.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&ip=0) about Hitler.

Hopefully someone will point out why the following nightmare scenario is either not possible or at least wildly unlikely:\n\nWith US intelligence agencies recently being placed in disarray or otherwise compromised, and key people being dismissed, agents from whatever hostile country (such as Russia) are able to sneak in enough nuclear materials bit by bit to construct one or more  nuclear bombs on US soil, maybe somewhere in some  basement in a populated city (or in multiple cities).\n\nOne day they detonate one, to show they can do it.  Not knowing who the attacker is, the US has no enemy to retaliate on.  The attackers declare, anonymously, that the US military worldwide must stand down or another one will go off.\n\nTrump of course pooh-poohs the idea that Russia is involved so doesn't target them, so they're off the hook.  Maybe he accuses some country like Iran and targets them.\n\nAnother one goes off in New York and they say the next one will be Washington unless the US military completely stands down and closes all bases.  Maybe they do Washington anyway because, hey why not, they're anonymous.\n\nA new era ensues, probably controlled by China and Russia..\n\nMAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) is supposed to work only if the attacker knows they can't get away with it without their own destruction.

He is pals with Putin, who is also trying to occupy more land starting with Ukraine. Trump then blackmails Ukraine asking for their natural resources without any agreement for security, or they will pull out, letting Russia take them over. Then Trump gets jealous of Taiwans income just like he did Canada's and Greenlands, so then he decides not to recognize Taiwan's independence, opening them up for war. Meanwhile, NATO has some concerns but is not being proactive about Trump's dictatorship because they are not sure how to react. Heck, even China looks like a better partner at the moment than the US. Even the States in the United States are suing Trump and Elon Musk because they have gone too far. Although it shouldn't be a surprise that Trump, who is a convicted sexual abuser with 34 counts of fraud, is a dictator too, few people know how to approach this situation. That being said, Trump's a mad man thief who keeps breaking contracts and can't be trusted. So he can't actually broker any real business deals without their being a double-edged sword attached to it. Every country knows it at this point, turning the United States into enemy number one to the whole world. And the more things don't go Trump's way, the more chaos pursues. So the question is, how bad will it get?o far, Trump has created a trade war with Canada, Mexico, and China. He made threats of a military war with Greenland and Canada. He is pals with Putin, who is also trying to occupy more land starting with Ukraine. Trump then blackmails Ukraine asking for their natural resources without any agreement for security, or they will pull out, letting Russia take them over. Then Trump gets jealous of Taiwans income just like he did Canada's and Greenlands, so then he decides not to recognize Taiwan's independence, opening them up for war. Meanwhile, NATO has some concerns but is not being proactive about Trump's dictatorship because they are not sure how to react. Heck, even China looks like a better partner at the moment than the US. Even the States in the United States are suing Trump and Elon Musk because they have gone too far. Although it shouldn't be a surprise that Trump, who is a convicted sexual abuser with 34 counts of fraud, is a dictator too, few people know how to approach this situation. That being said, Trump's a mad man thief who keeps breaking contracts and can't be trusted. So he can't actually broker any real business deals without their being a double-edged sword attached to it. Every country knows it at this point, turning the United States into enemy number one to the whole world. And the more things don't go Trump's way, the more chaos pursues. So the question is, how bad will it get?",

This means that if an executive order is found to be unconstitutional, for example, the president isn't at risk of being arrested for making such an order.

The US has done it before, most recently during the Vietnam War.\n\nConscription certainly wouldn't be their preferred course, though. People forced into military service tend not to be as effective as volunteer soldiers, and the act of forcing people to join makes the war more unpopular and increases social unrest. It's why even Putin in Russia has had limits when it comes to how far he'll go when it comes to sending conscripted soldiers into battle.\n\nAll that said, and I'm speaking as a Canadian, unfortunately, I don't think war with us would require the US to extend themselves to the point where they would need to start up a draft. The US army is vastly superior to ours. Maybe the rest of NATO would join on the side of Canada, which would then make the war much harder for the US, but I'm not confident that NATO would come to our aid with anything more than words in that scenario.\n\nAll that said, I don't think Trump is close to invading Canada. I think he's far more likely to escalate things in terms of tariffs, and Canada needs to do everything it can to move its economy away from reliance on the United States. I also support significant increases in Canadian defense spending to expand Canada's ability to assert soft power and further move independent from the States' sphere of influence.",

What will be gained by Ukraine keeping the war going?\n\nThere are going to be several goals, depending on who you're talking to.\n\nThe first is that while Ukraine can't reclaim territory, there is a choice in how costly it can make it. This matters for two reasons. One is the moral one, since it is effectively endorsing an unjust invasion. But also it matters for deterring potential future conflicts- the cheaper the cost of an invasion, the more invasions will pencil out as a worthwhile trade off. A nontrivial reason Russia invaded in the first place is the (relative lack of) reaction to it's invasion of Crimea. If Zelensky hadn't turned out to be such a surprise in context, they probably would have gotten off with negligible costs.\n\nBut the bigger issue is strategic. A ceasefire would give Russia room to rebuild itself. This is both militarily/economically- it'd be able to solidify control of various regions and entrench itself, as well as work towards building out factories etc. It'd also create room for Russia to relegitimize itself internationally. There will be a push to reduce sanctions and the like, especially from countries that want access to it's oil.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest issue is that any ceasefire doesn't necessarily guarantee any meaningful peace. Not only did Russia invade now, it's invaded before (notably, Crimea, but it's also been involved in places like Georgia as well). So it's not at all clear that a compromise would actually achieve the thing being traded for, especially combined with Russia's ability to rebuild. If it has the ability to violate the compromise at will, it's kind of an empty promise.",

Now it seems the cost is about equal, maybe that the ukranians are on the losing side with less or no US support.

If it has the ability to violate the compromise at will, it's kind of an empty promise.\"\n\nLike I said I see your points, but I don't see how more years of war will change this except bleed Russia in a extremely brutal war where Ukrainians are dying in large numbers as well. As far as I see it there's no indication that anything will happen which will drastically impact Russias ability to carry out the war (a coup, mass protests/strikes, etc). There's no reason to believe that more years of war will put Ukraine in a better negotiating position.\n\nI'm actually personally a bit invested in this as half my family is from Finland, who had to give up large amounts of territory to the Soviet Union in the 30's and 40's. There's never been a point until modern times were Finlands independence have been guaranteed (Finland joined NATO just after the Ukraine invasion), yet at one point they had to make peace and try to find a way to survive post-war. The same will happen to Ukraine, and it will be an uncertain future. I don't see how more years of war will change that.",

For them, it's mostly a vibe check. They may like the ideas on a very superficial level (ie, \"Ukraine\" and \"peace\" sounds good, because peace is generally a good thing), but not necessarily any of the actual details. Most voters would not be able to tell you much beyond immigration is a concern and they want something done- not any specifics of how it's currently being implemented. \n\nThat's unlikely to change until it starts to affect them personally.\n\n>On reddit, it seems like everyone hates trump. \n\nOn top of the above, roughly 20-30% of Americans are partisan towards each party. (This partisanship also isn't mutually exclusive with not following the news. There are some people who are partisan but don't follow details of specific issues).\n\nThe U.S. electorate splits roughly 20-30% likes him, 20-30% hate him, and ~40-60% aren't actively very attached to politics. There also tends to be a pretty reliable honeymoon period right after someone takes office, that lasts for a few months, regardless of issues or candidate.\n\nReddit demographically tends to skew towards demographics that dislike him (young, educated, etc, which also correlates with being left). So given 20% liking him for partisanship, another 30-40% or so being ok with things based on vibes is pretty plausible. That gets you to ~50-60% approval.\n\nFor what it's worth, this isn't unique to Trump, but more broadly true. Even for extremely public and contentious issues like say, Obamacare, the average voter had no clue what it did, even when it was saturating the news when it was being passed as a new law",

Are we talking American individuals or American companies/workers? Because as an individual outside of an industrial/manufacturing job, tariffs don't do anything besides make goods more expensive. You will spend more money, that is not really in question. \n\nThe tradeoff is that tariffs are inherently protectionist policies meant to protect native industry and production. The reason we as consumers buy stuff from other countries is because the free market results in cheaper production and cheaper costs in different places around the world. Those cheaper products hurt local industry and manufacturing because obviously we can't compete with textiles made in China and India through sweat shops where workers are paid pennies. The goal of tariffs is to even the playing field so that locally made products have a chance where consumers become incentivized to buy American, which again, was not the cheaper option previously. And as people buy more American things in the US, companies are incentivized to bring manufacturing and industry back into the US if they want to take advantage of the US's market. \n\nWhat's fascinating to me about all of this is, idgaf about any of that. I want cheaper prices. I don't really care about manufacturing jobs and it doesn't bother me if those jobs don't come back.",

If you look at things like the voting totals, it's not *that* much of a shift, on average. The U.S. is pretty split (with each party at ~30% of the vote, and ~40% of people not voting), so even minor shifts can lead to large swings in results.\n\nFor perspective, Trump got 49.8% of the vote in 2024. In 2020, he got 46.8% (in raw vote totals, 77.3 mil to 74.2mil). Depending on how you slice it (relative to the entire population, the electorate, active voters, etc), that's still only a few percentage points shift.\n\nOut of places that did shift, Latino populations in Southern Texas are probably areas that may have experienced larger than average shifts.",

We can't read minds, so we can only speculate. There's a lot of potential reasons, from intentional trolling, to trying to normalize Nazi views, testing the waters to see the reaction, or just as a display of power/immunity.\n\n>wouldnt that be a univerally stupid idea for literally anyone?\n\nWell, that depends on what you mean by \"stupid\". If by stupid you mean there has to be some consequence, he hasn't really suffered much as a result of the action. So arguably it wasn't stupid, if he got away with it (or even if he just thought he would be, and miscalculated).\n\nBut separately from that, even if we assume it's universally stupid doesn't mean it's impossible. People do stupid things all the time, and Musk himself has had several controversies (one nonpolitical example being his public tweet about taking Tesla private. He promptly got sued and lost) that didn't really make any rational sense. And sometimes he's even been insulated from any consequence of those impulse actions, as well.\n\nThis isn't even the first controversy around Nazism specifically that he's had. He's previously done things like unban literal Nazis on Twitter (while simultaneously banning others he dislikes, which is inconsistent with simply a strong belief in free speech).",

Saved money can be re-allocated to other parts of the government to serve the country's interests, but unless there's an actual mechanism for distributing that money to the public (e.g. checks being sent to citizens) it's not \"going back to the American citizen\" literally.",
