But when it's a preist, the parents might convince the child it didn't happen, or downplay it so as not to draw attention and put the church in a bad light.  They might be advised by the church that the matter will be handled internally. What happens has been documented many times. The church moves the preist to another location, and they commit the same crime, then get moved again.",

He would yell at him for minor things and one time, I remember vividly, he threw all of the kids stuff in his little cubby desk out the window in front of the entire class. He literally took his entire desk and physically placed it out the window and emptied everything out. The kid just stood in the corner and said nothing while the rest of us watched and sat at our tables. It was also a nice spring sunny day, so after that, 20 minutes later, the kid went outside during recess to pickup all his stuff by himself. I think most if not all of us back then weren't aware of what child abuse was and just mindless sat there thinking it was normal. I think back sometimes and think how messed up the 90s were because I can remember seeing way more events of adults terrorizing children back then. Mind you, there was a physical attribute to this as well, we were all small kids while these male teachers were all at least 6 foot tall.\n\nI remember seeing that same kid when he was in high school, he joined the football team and gained more confidence. I wonder if he still remembers any of that.\n\nI've tried looking up this teacher but nothing comes up. Last I remembered he had left the school, possibly retired, and I vaguely remembered seeing him drive a white van and he was part of the city orchestra group. Its been many years and I couldn't find anything about him online so he may be dead by now.",

Religion lets them play with the guilt factor more than elsewhere.  \"If you tell, God will be angry...\"    Or \"It's okay because...\"\n\n4:  Silence.  Not just the Catholic Church, but many churches cover it up and move offenders around.  They don't want shame upon their entity, so they don't cast them out or report them.   The Catholic Church ended up mostly in the news because they are a giant organization, but it happens in many other churches.\n\n5.  Chameleon abilities.  Many abusers can seem like absolutely great people to those they aren't attacking.  Which makes it harder to believe that they would do that.
