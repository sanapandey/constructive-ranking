    "selftext": "Me 16m and my first girlfriend 16f have been dating for 2 months now, last week she gave me an hand job and it surprisingly took me longer than I expected to cum, I was sure it would be quick and every time I did jerk off thinking about doing sexual thing with her I would cum regularly in a few minutes. I really do think I like (or love) her, when I\u2019m with her I\u2019m definitely hard when we kiss or hug and even when I\u2019m just looking at her, we would cuddle and make out and I would touch her  and I would get obviously hard so until the hand job I never thought something was weird, I even gave her Vaseline and only then I finished. Today, she gave me a blow job and I did wear a condom just to try it and again it took me so long I think it was also because of the condom I could barely even feel something but after like 15-20 minutes maybe even more of her trying to make me cum and she used her hands a little too I told her yeah it\u2019s definitely because of the condom but because it\u2019s her first time she said she would do it now without it so she jerked me off with the condom for a bit and I say let\u2019s do it without and it took like a few minutes again and all the time even after I removed to condom and I was hard and all it took me longer to cum than when I jerk off alone I think, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s good cuz i last a lot or a bad thing.",

            "body": "I think this sounds pretty much normal. You might be more nervous, too much thinking into things. Once you relax it will maybe come quicker. Also, you can give her instructions and tell her what feels good and what not, it might take time for you guys to figure that out.   \n  \nIt might also take some time getting used to the difference between masturbating and your partner pleasuring you.",

I think you should relax and enjoy the moment together, and I\u2019m pretty sure that you\u2019ll start enjoying it faster. I\u2019m older now, but I love to go down on my wife and then let her choose what she wants to do. It truly helps me to enjoy the rest of the time with her, and we both are very verbal in our relationship. This too tends to help things along, but it\u2019s a take it slow kinda thing.",

There's a running joke that a lot of girls are bad at handjobs, but it's just that, yeah.. it's yours you're just gonna inherently know it better (same's true with guys pleasing girls obviously). Especially with young relationships, you're both literally just learning, totally normal nothing's wrong at all. I say maybe try it again and if it gets to the point where it feels like it's starting to take a bit too long, maybe see if she's fine with you finishing yourself off.. on her.",
