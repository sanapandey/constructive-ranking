However, It is filled with a lot of actual tankies and communists. A lot of the people on there will have serious political discussions with each other, it's just sprinkled with a lot of extreme satire that's hard to spot for outsiders, and those people inside the subreddit think it's hilarious and love that other people don't know. It's a weird blend of satire and serious posts. Atleast that's how it was a long time ago when I used to frequent it. I imagine as time goes on more insane people who take it seriously will start to join and then it becomes even harder to know for sure.",

This shit ain't worth your time if a few thousand dumbasses want to move there and get killed by the regime, or if they simply want to shit post 'glory greatest country'. \n\nMost likely, some people are ironic, some poor lads might not be.
