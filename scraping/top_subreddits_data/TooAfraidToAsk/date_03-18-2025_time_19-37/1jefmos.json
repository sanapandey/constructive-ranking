Men\u2019s higher testosterone levels are linked to increased sexual initiative and assertiveness, whereas women\u2019s libido is more influenced by hormonal cycles. However, cultural expectations also play a major role\u2014women are often socialized to exercise more restraint, which may give the impression that they naturally have better control over their urges. In reality, sexual desire and impulse control are shaped by a complex interplay of hormones, psychology, and social conditioning.\n\nBottom line, it isn\u2019t about \u201elearning\u201c as a person doesn\u2019t live in a vacuum.

Thus, society picks up on these behaviors, whether consciously or subconsciously, and subsequently creates societal norms surrounding these.\n\nEx: Estrogen and testosterone regulate how much one cries (or at least how easy it is for the tears to flow), therefore, women cry more often. Therefore, people associate crying with women (and children, but not relevant here), and so when a man cries, some people feel this runs contrary to what is supposed to be in his nature even though the rule was never and never will be an absolute.",

We know this because low testosterone creates in men fatigue, lack of motivation, inability to take decisions, lack of passion, low libido and bone/muscle mass. Excessive testosterone can cause rage and anger management disorders and violent outbursts.\n\nSo, it isn\u2019t that female biology teaches restraint as much as male biology prioritizes careless action and movement with lower restraint.\n\nOur sex drive might be similar, but male sex drive is regulated by a hormone that drives aggressive behavior and female sex drive is regulated by a hormone that doesn\u2019t really.",

Every women I\u2019ve been with who\u2019ve I\u2019ve treated with respect and kindness, and who I\u2019ve made feel totally safe expressing their often hidden/suppressed sexuality with me, has had a sex drive just about as explosive as any man if not even greater. Women want to have sex too, but only with the right man.\n\nI think most women have experiences being very open with their sexuality early on before they get shamed for it (usually by their family, older community members, or even online, etc.). They then hide it away and pretend like they don\u2019t want it or like it, waiting to meet a man they not only find attractive but who allows her to express her sexuality without fear of judgement or backlash. The men who feel confident enough to allow their own sexuality to be matched or exceeded by their female counterpart usually have better overall success with women.",

Women don't really have a biological need to orgasm (though they do have a desire for it). I've heard the closest comparison is a woman's need to empty her breasts while she is lactating. As her breasts fill up they become painful, making her very interested in getting them emptied. \n\nWhile biology is what it is, I'd advice men to put more effort into their social life. A lot of men use sex in an attempt to avoid loneliness or to make themselves feel significant. While this is natural to some extent, I'd say there are easier and healthier ways to meet these needs.

They're doing double/triple the work they'd have when single, and they're exhausted. They're happier single because there's more control, they clean something... it stays tidy, they don't have to beg for support, attention, etc.\n\n.....\n\nWhen it comes to sex and sexual urges:\n\nOne huge factor is that society shames and crushes women's sexual desire. Slut shames etc. So they hide and bury those desires. Whereas men are encouraged to express these desires and get sex, so when they fail at that, they feel they're failing as men.\n\nSingle vs Married work. As mentioned she starts to resent and see him as a dependent. Her sexual desire is crushed, she loses interest. So it's easier to manage those desires when... they're wiped out.\n\nAnd another is the orgasm gap between men and women, selfish sex, porn expectations, etc etc etc leaves women unsatisfied. VS solo they orgasm 90%+ of the time. And with other women over 70% of the time. So...... if she's used to being let down by sex with men, then again those urges are going to be more easily managed. Less desire. Fine sorting it themselves.",

All it takes is me wanting to stop (for whatever reason, maybe I have a muscle cramp or something) and he keeps going because he doesn\u2019t want to stop.

(Feminists raging \"not all women!) Ok just most of them.\n\nBut we cannot tell men the truth. Why? Because domination comes along with \"consensual non consent.\" If you tell men women want to be dominated, men will get the wrong idea and start acting what what they think they learned, and start raping and abusing women thinking they are being compliant with female sexuality.\n\nAnyways this freak sex is not like normal sex. Yes there are vanilla women but most just aren't.\n\nDon't you ever wonder \"why do women need to be 'warmed up'?\" Men don't need to warm up. We get hard, penis gets stimulated, boom boom pow, orgasm achieved.\n\nDomination and submission sex requires a build up. You have to start from the lowest level and work your way to the highest level. So you go from taking the girl by her hand and leading her to bedroom, to cuffing her hands behind her back, to stroking her arms and legs, to her thighs and hips, to teasing her nipples and her pussy with just a finger, to putting on a blindfold, to making her suck your dick, to light spanking, to harder spanking, to making her choke on your dick, to slapping her in the face, to suffocating her till she nearly passes out, to making her a blowjob giving slave, to putting her in a dog crate as a permanent sex slave, to turning her into a permanent fixture like a coffee table wrapped in leather that you put your feet on.\n\nObviously this progression could be any type of thing I'm just making up a random progression.\n\nMostly conceptually and fantasy wise. Obviously you're not going to literally turn your GF into a coffee table. It's about playing and saying the ideas to her while you tease and torture her. By the time you stick your dick in she's already been having mental orgasms. Every step of the way causes her to have a mental orgasm where she feels wave after ever of increasing pleasure ripple through her whole body. Adding stimulation to sensitive areas and teasing them makes it all the much better.\n\nBut it's all about HER mind. You slowly climb up this ladder of increasingly kinky shit, and by the time conceptually and mentally she reaches the Pinnacle of whatever her particular fantasies are, and boom, after multiple multiple multiple orgasms, she has a \"final release\" orgasm, by imagining being locked in a cage for you as your permanent degraded sex slave.\n\nThis is why women aren't horny all the time. Because it takes WORK to even get her that horny. She has to mentally go through the steps too. She has to visualize and fantasize about all of that stuff in order to get turned on.\n\nAll men have to do is see a woman, see some cleavage, see some thighs, see a nice butt in some yoga pants, and we are like \"damn I can't wait to go home and bust a nut to that hot girl I saw today.\"\n\nIn order to trigger a woman in the same way she needs to witness a man being dominant.\n\nThat's why I think the \"patriarchy\" was created by men's interpretation of female sexuality. It's WOMEN whose most profoundest urge is to experience the removal of her power over her own body and to be dominated by a man.\n\nMen just know it by proxy, and turned into a law of reality, and a law among men that all men must be strong powerful and dominant or else suffer the consequences. The only real consequence was if you didn't, you didn't get to have sex.\n\nSorry. I know if anyone reads this they'll be mad. I know I'll get replies telling me to touch grass or something stupid like that. Well I struggled with women my whole life and it wasn't until I realized these truths that I was able to get good in bed and make a woman addicted to me.\n\nI can have her just cumming her brains out for hours and hours and hours. And after 34+ years of dating and having short relationships and remembering what happened, nearly every gf I ever had wanted me to CNC her. I just couldn't possibly understand why they would want to be choked and slapped and spanked and be treated viciously. To express real anger and jerk her around like a doll. I couldn't undersrsnd it. And now I do. And I believe most women are like this. Their ultimate fantasies are to be slaves for vicious men who explode in violent anger and she is the target.\n\nI didn't make them like that. All this CNC stuff is just the \"safe\" version of it all. It's all true. That's how women are. If y'all are mad about it that's on you.",
