In this situation, the judicial branch would give its rulings, and the executive branch would enforce them. So the judicial branch was never given any enforcement powers.\n\nObviously, we are not in an ideal situation.",

It is *our* job to fix this. And since there is no procedure to do that within the constitution, whatever we do will have to be \"illegal\" in at least a technical sense. That is not necessarily the same as violent.",
