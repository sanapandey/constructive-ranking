    "selftext": "I've watched several movies where they dump lime on dead bodies and I gave it a Google search and nothing shows up I assume because they don't want people to be expert body disposers or something. \n\nI've seen it in Full Metal Jacket, Goodfellas and The Wire. No clue why they do it but I'd like to know ",

Calcium hydroxide vs. potassium hydroxide.\n\nLime has been used for centuries to keep the smell down, discourage predation, and serve as a disinfectant. It doesn't help to break down the bodies as some believe: soil bacteria need a pH of between 4 and 10, and lime is much more alkaline than that.\n\n[Read all about it](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=8b8862db9765dabf047901d0b6c973af85ceb5de).",

If not, you need to dig really deep (like six feet or more) or else the smell can rise up and clue someone in something's wrong.\n\nIt also has the benefit of fucking with any DNA evidence you leave behind. Any hair or blood would be contaminated with lime residue and make it hard to be used in court against you since, supposedly a good defense attorney could use the contaminant to introduce doubt.",

It's also used in the lime splitting process, which separates the hide into the upper layer (full grain leather, known for its suppleness) and the secondary layer (crust leather, used for more affordable leather because of its less supple and versatile nature). \n\nLye is used in soap making. Diluted good grade lye is also used in some cooking, such as pretzels or processing corn into maize and masa, but it's used as a soak to break down tough fibers (like the skin of the corn kernels) and to give food like German pretzels their distinct texture.",
