I KNOW THEY ARE IN THE SCHENGEN ZONE**\n\nThat's not what Im asking, Im asking about how there's hardly any hostility towards them by outsiders when many of them express skepticism in fully adopting the Euro currency and becoming an EU member. \n\nWhen a Swiss person expresses Euroskepticism, folks are often like \"awww, that's ok, you do you! What a beautiful country you have!\"\n\nIm asking this because Im here in Ticino now and folks are often very openly nationalist and would criticize the EU parliament, the common market, military spending, etc... \n\nBut if you get snappy about these things in many Italian cities, folks get outraged. \n\nWhy is Swiss Euroskpeticism so accepted but not those of the member countries?\n\nEDIT - Just to clarify, folks, Im a dual-citizen, Italian and American, who is pro-EU and anti-Meloni.

Who elected her?\n\nThe Swiss like to say that they are not \u201c*governed*\u201d, they are \u201c*counselled*\u201d. Their democratic model really leaves room for grassroots initiatives.\n\nIf you come up with an idea for a new law or regulation, it\u2019s enough to gather a petition of 50,000 signatures (if memory serves), and the draft is put in front of the senate to be checked for compliance with the constitution. In the affirmative, the senate has then the obligation to call up a poll (votation) to let the people decide whether it should be enacted or not.",

Just look how the \"democracy\" works there, like that a vote from Malta counts around seven times more than a vote from Germany, because the EU parliament has not two chambers with different counting for votes and seats.\n\nLook at how Ursual von der Leyen became president of the EU commission, it was a backroom deal between Merkel and Macron, Merkel needed to get rid of her because she was involved in a serious scandal as former head of the DoD in Germany.\n\nBut that's not your question i guess, as you asked why there is little skepticism: Switzerland always got on its own way through history. Despite the important events like the Vienna Congress 1820 after Napoleon was defeated, it goes all back to the medieval- and rennaissance-times. Basically after the time the Swiss mercenaries business stopped in general (except for a few regiments, the only one today is the Swiss Guards in Vatican), we just minded our own business.\n\nI can't really tell much about Italy, but it is for sure different when you are a member. I don't think it has anything to do with Meloni, i see a lot of EU fans that get very, veeeery angry when you criticize anything about the EU. Even the most obvious things like corruption scandals, it's just like \"nothing to see here, please go on\".\n\nIf you refer to Reddit, most users in subs like about europe are quite fanatical EU-guys, that won't receive any criticism well. But they are not really what many people think in real-life. Like so often in the web, it's a loud minority.",
