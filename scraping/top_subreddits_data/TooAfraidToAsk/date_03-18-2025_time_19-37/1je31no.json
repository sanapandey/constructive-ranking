The youngest is still at an age where anything that moves (or may move in the future) needs to be pounced on and mauled.

Berlin actually had a higher population than now, 80 years later! And London has always been hellish. Historical city densities were insane. \n\nThere's a museum in Berlin (currently undergoing renovations) that shows photos of the living conditions *before WW2* and they're god awful.
