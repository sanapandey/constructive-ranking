(probably not)\n\n- How can I install Windows 11?\n\n- Can you recommend a program to play music?\n\n- How do I get back to the old Sound Control Panel?\n\nSorting by New is recommend and is the default.\n\n----\n\nBe sure to check out the [Windows 11 version 24H2 Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/1ftpmes/windows_11_2024_update_24h2_build_26100_megathread/) and also the [Windows 11 FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows/wiki/faq) posts, they likely have the answers to your Windows 11 questions already!",

            "body": "Windows 11 Taskbar Space Usage Make No Sense\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/fIzex05\n\nThe taskbar bugs and makes no sense. Why are all of these icons only available if I click the three-dot expand icon, when they could just fit on the right? I keep having to click twice when I could click once. It seems like the app I always need to get to is somehow hidden in the expanded section too. I have the grouping option turned off in Settings. \n\nReally appreciate any advice or input if there's a setting I'm missing. To my knowledge all of my screen resolution settings are default / normal.\n\nThanks in advance for any help.",

            "body": "Snipping tool now moves the mouse, closing menues, before taking delayed snips. I know print screen exists but I like the fact that cropping is part of the tool and I can right-click copy without having to go hunting down the image. \n\nIs there any way to fix this so that it actually takes pictures of menus? For example, I went to take a screenshot of the notification settings on discord but when it goes to capture the image, the final menu option collapses. \n\nThis is rendering it nearly unusable when I want to use it for easy walkthroughs. Is there anything I can do to get it to work correctly again?\n\nAdditionally, it has started to produce really warped images on my laptop screen. I'm guessing it's due to the text scaling that I have set up for accessibility purposes. Why doesn't their software play nice with their own accessibility features?",
