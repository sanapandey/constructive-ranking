    "selftext": "Hello, I am shopping for a lite and fast antivirus software for my son's Lenovo C630 (Snapdragon 850) laptop.\n\nHe is entering HS this year and their BYOD policy says they have to have an antivirus software installed. I know what you are thinking. Why not just use Windows Defender?  Well, we are in Japan and the Japanese bureaucracy in the schools is VERY technologically incompetent and rigid in their rules so we are pretty much forced to install something on top of Windows Defender.\n\nThe devices has 8GB of ram but it's still the 850 processor and I think it's using a UFS SSD which can feel pretty sluggish.\n\nA quick search shows Bitdefender and Malwarebytes both have ARM versions. Is either of these 'lighter' than the other?\n\nAny recommendations would be appreciated!",
