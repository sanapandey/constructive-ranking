    "selftext": "My laptop is nearing 10 years old, but it still functions well other than the battery drain and some more intensive tasks (I use Photoshop, Illustrator, Vegas Pro occasionally), but otherwise it works well for my needs which is very little. Since graduating college, my need for a daily driver personal computer has diminished since I don't study or write papers anymore - I have a desktop and laptop given to me at work, and I don't work from home so very rarely have to do a lot of work at home. I still use my PC to store all my local files like personal documents, photos, music, etc. \n\nBut I don't really \"need\" to upgrade my laptop. But with Windows 10 support ending soon, I'm wondering if force upgrading to Windows 11 on this computer will cause it to be unusable. When I run the PC Health Check, the only unsupported issue is the processer (Intel Core i7-6500U CPU @ 2.5GHz), everything else is fine (I have 8 gigs RAM and 512 gig SSD). Just curious if anyone can comment whether my processor would run Windows 11 well or if I should just stick to Windows 10 or think about upgrading my computer. Thanks!",
