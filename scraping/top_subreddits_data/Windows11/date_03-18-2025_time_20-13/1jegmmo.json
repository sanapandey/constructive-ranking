You can help build Windows 11 alongside PC experts, IT pros, and developers around the world. If, however, you think BIOS is a plant-based fuel, this program may not be right for you.\n\nIf you are experiencing an issue with an Insider build and basic troubleshooting steps such as rebooting did not correct it, then it is very important to use the Feedback Hub to report it. That tool will gather diagnostic data needed to properly troubleshoot the issue and will send it to the Engineering Team. The process is simple and only takes a few minutes:\n\n1. Open the \"Feedback Hub\" app and click *\"Report a problem\"*\n\n2. Follow the on-screen instructions and click *\"Submit\"*\n\n3. Your feedback has now been shared with Microsoft. You can also share it here on Reddit by clicking *\"Share my feedback\"* and open the feedback you submitted\n\n4. Click *\"Share\"* and copy the unique link\n\n5. Paste the link in a comment here along with some information regarding your issue. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Windows11) if you have any questions or concerns.*",
