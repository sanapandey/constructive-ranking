    "selftext": "Pretty often the icons in my taskbars start to look a little too bright, like the contrast is a little off. It's not very well visible in the screen recording but you can see that when the window is maximized or the start menu is open, the taskbar icons gets a little bit darker, that's how they're *supposed* to look, i.e. how they look all the time when this bug isn't active. Does anyone know what causes this and how it can be prevented?\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1je8li7/video/bab8tsam2hpe1/player\n\n",
