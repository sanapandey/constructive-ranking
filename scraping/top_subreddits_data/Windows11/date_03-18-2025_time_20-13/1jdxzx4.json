Its not because you are quicker with a mouse.  Its because you think that everyone does things the way you do them, so your way is naturally quickest for everyone.  \n\nAs the other person said, maybe if you are someone who only runs maximized windows so the x is always in the top right of your screen and your mouse will always stop there.  Maybe you don't need to open and close and manage windows as often so you aren't worried about the efficiency of doing so.  \n\nMost power users are using multiple tiled windows, and restored windows, so finding and putting a mouse cursor on a small x is not ever going to be as quick.
