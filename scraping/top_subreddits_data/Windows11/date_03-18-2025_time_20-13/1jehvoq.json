    "selftext": "\nThe clipboard acess is right there, why prioritize emojis page?\n\nThis reminds me of the decision to replace the tasks shortcut that existed in the calendar in W10 with a focus mode button (which would make more sense to be a stopwatch, few people use focus mode). \n\nDesign usability needs more care and attention.\n\nFor those who don't know, design usability is the ease with which a person can perform a task, especially those requested in the feedback hub (a waste of time, there are so many simple things that have been requested for years, but they decide to put things that no one, or an extremely small group, asked for).\n\nSo that you don't think this is generalized hate against W11, I recognize that the new Share feature when dragging the mouse to the top of the screen is something brilliant, although I hope they give us the option to pin third party applications.\n\nDesign usability deserves special care, I hope they improve this.\n",
