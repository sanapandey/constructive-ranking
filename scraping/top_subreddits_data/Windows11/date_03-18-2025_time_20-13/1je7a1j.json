    "selftext": "My last work laptop had windows 11 with the new version of notepad with new features that I know many people hate but that l actually made use of (preserving edits without changing and advanced formatting). \n  \nThat laptop was dying so I got a new (previously used) one that has the old version of notepad and I can\u2019t figure out how to get the new one. Every single web search result for this is complaining about the new version wanting to revert to the old one and I want the opposite. I even called my company\u2019s tech-support and that guy didn\u2019t even know what I was talking about since somehow he\u2019s got the old version too \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n  \nI work for a very large company so my ability to do admin things on this computer is pretty limited (e.g. the MS store is completely turned off) but if you show me a way to upgrade to the newer one I\u2019ll be your best friend forever because this little thing actually makes a difference in my workflow \ud83d\ude4f ",

            "body": "The new Notepad is delivered via an update provided by the Microsoft Store, so if your machine is heavily locked down you likely won't be able to access it. Your best bet is to plead to your IT department and hope you can find someone sympathetic to either turn on the Store or find a way to push the update to you.",

Given that the first person I talked to on the IT help line didn\u2019t even know what I was talking about doesn\u2019t give me great hope. I guess it worked okay without those features for the first 30 years of its lifespan so I\u2019ll just hope the next laptop magically has the new version \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffd",
