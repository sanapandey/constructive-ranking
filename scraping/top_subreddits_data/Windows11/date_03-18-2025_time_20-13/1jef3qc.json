This common issue affects many users, but the good news is there are several effective solutions.\n\n## The Main Culprit: Multiple Device Pairing\n\nThe primary cause of Bluetooth stuttering on Windows 11 is having your headset paired with multiple devices simultaneously. Even when those other devices aren't actively streaming audio, they can interfere with your Windows connection, causing those annoying stutters and drops.\n\n## Quick Solutions\n\n### 1. Single-Device Pairing\nThe most effective fix is to unpair your headset from all other devices, leaving it connected only to your Windows computer. This eliminates competing signals and dramatically improves stability.\n\n### 2. Windows 11 Sound Settings Adjustments\nSeveral settings tweaks can resolve stuttering issues:\n- Navigate to Settings > System > Sound\n- Under \"Output,\" select your Bluetooth headset\n- Click \"Properties\" and disable \"Exclusive Mode\" in the Advanced tab\n- Set Audio format to 16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality) instead of higher sample rates\n- Disable \"Spatial Sound\" which can cause processing delays\n\n### 3. Driver Management\n- Update your Bluetooth adapter drivers through Device Manager\n- If problems persist after updating, try rolling back to a previous driver version\n- Some users report success by completely uninstalling and reinstalling Bluetooth drivers\n\nBy implementing these solutions, you can enjoy smooth, uninterrupted audio with your Bluetooth headset on Windows 11. Don't let technical issues prevent you from experiencing pristine sound quality during your work or entertainment sessions.\n\nHave you tried any of these fixes?
