I assume its efficiency mode.\n\n7800x3d/4070tiS/32GB ram/1tb m.2 etc\n\nAny time that I have two games open at once the second game throttles when out of focus. Even if its two low resource games. Never had any problems on any other version of windows. Yes I've done all the background fps limits/power options.",
