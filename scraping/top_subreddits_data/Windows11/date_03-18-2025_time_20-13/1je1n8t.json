    "selftext": "Hi, \n\nI'm currently researching Windows 11 Security festures for university. I'm supposed to look into things like \n\n- VBS\n- Enhanced Credential Guard\n- Smart App Control\n- Passkeys / Passwordless Authentication\n- Microsoft Pluton\n\nCan anyone recommend good, non-microsoft resources for this? I'm looking for anything related to these features, eg. technical explanations/descriptions, walk-throughs of exploits, security research, ...\n\nSo far, I have already found itm4n's blog and a study on smart app control by the german BSI.",
