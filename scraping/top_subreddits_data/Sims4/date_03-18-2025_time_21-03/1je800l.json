I've been making homes in the sims for around 10 years now with around 1700 hours of playtime, and there's quite a bunch of them in my gallery. If you really go back to my first homes, there are really far from this level of quality though x)  \nThanks for the compliment !",

It took my about 4 hours just to furnish and decorate the family room last night. An hour on the half bath, which should have been super quick and easy. But no. No, I must torment myself and make it perfect as I possibly can. And I'm at 3750 hours of playtime. I really need to work on my decision making abilities!",

I mean, I guess everyone is free to spend as much time on their builds as they want :3 I did simplify my style a little however (especially the interior derocation part). I used to place a lot of clutter everywhere, and it took a lot of time and sometimes ended up making a room too crammy (same with the garden too actually, with lots of flowers and bushes everywhere). Over time I personnaly ended up simplifying things a bunch, which made the work faster and often helped the rooms and lots breathe a bit more so, it was a double win.",

I do feel a bit better about getting by in a brief conversation; if it includes gestures.... \n\nBeside the point.  My main comment about the vid is this:  Edit more.  I like seeing choices made and where it's going and how you got there, but there are still areas you could improve by cutting repetitions.  But I did about 40 years as an editor so I could be biased.  \n\nMy mantra as an editor [and what I told people I edited] was cut till it hurts; then cut more.  That was newspaper and then tech writers, for the most part, but in my last job (now retired) at a software startup I edited instructional vids.  A ton of them.  People have much shorter attention spans than we think.",
