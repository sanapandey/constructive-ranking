I've done all of the aspirations for children and teens like a gazillion times over, and I find these 2 life stages sooo boring. I play generations all the time, and to do adult aspirations as a teen, what would be left for my adults to do? Anyway, rant over! I'm a console player. \ud83e\udd10 I also have all of the add-ons. Any ideas to spice things up are welcome. ",

I also want my teens to have a decent friend group (I usually use the club system) and get some experience with dating, so not everbody ends up marrying the first sim they fall in love with. For teens, I also focus on figuring out in which field they are going to work and getting them some skills, so they don't start their adult life from zero.\n\nA lot of my sims are also occults, so their teen years also include training their occult skills. My werewolf pack specifically has a 'werewolf bootcamp', where all teens go to train their werewolf skills so that they have their rampaging under control by the time they age up. \n\nThis usually fills the time until YA pretty well.",

I always send younger sims to the celebration centre in San Sequoia for them to play at playground, 'studying' and practising music. Most of my played sims are occults as well except the werewolves don't have any formal 'training centre'. They mostly rely on premade werewolves for sparring activities all that.",

Most of the original werewolves (except the immortal ones) had died off, so I had made a werewolf couple who would have kids alongside my werewolf family and fill the ranks of the Moonwood Collective. But since they were unplayed, they never unlocked any wolf skills, couldn't transform at will and thus couldn't spar, kept rampaging on full moons, etc.\n\nSo I started moving any unplayed werewolf teens in with one of my played werewolfs until they had mastered enough skills to be good pack members, then returned them to unplayed status. The tradition grew from there.",

On the super long lifespan I play on those things all end up coming with time. \n\nChildren are a bit boring. I focus on making friends and a bit of developing their personality, future hobbies and interests and maybe start to get the vague idea of a career path for them. \n\nWith teens social life becomes a lot more fun. Do they hang out at the mall, the roller rink, the park, a back alley, in their basement glued to a video game. They might start to party, explore drugs. Get a fake ID. I further develop friendships and start exploring some romantic relationships.  \n\nWith my current teen it is all about romantic relationships. She is maybe 15 and has a boyfriend who is super wholesome. He is a Llama scout leader and does lots of activities with the kids in his group. Summer camp, bake sales, etc. Her parents think he is a really great kid. But she will end things with him and I have plans for a bit of a bad romance for her in senior year and a teen pregnancy. The person I have in mind to be the baby\u2019s father has some mental health  issues and she will try to make things work but end up a single mom. This is going into YA but as a single mom she will get a degree and do some school field work at a field research station I have set up in Sulani on the shipwreck lot. She will end up wanting to stay, become a marine biologist and move to Sulani with her child. I created the field research station probably over a year ago in real life. That is how long my lifespans are. I am so excited to play it but also have so much fun stuff to do in between. LOL. I never get bored. This is just one of the many story lines I have going on in my generational rotational play.",
