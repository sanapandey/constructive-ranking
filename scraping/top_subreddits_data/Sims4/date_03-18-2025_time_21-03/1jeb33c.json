So, I have 5 days of \"Summer Vacation\" in a row taking up one sim week, from Monday - Friday. The traditions all include \"Water Fun\" (I think it's called that? Swimming, playing in a sprinkler, etc.), Bar B Q (either cook using an outdoor grill or eat food that was cooked on an outdoor grill) and I forgot what it's specifically called, but playing with fire- so that they'll want to use a bonfire, make marshmallows around the bonfire, tell stories around the fire, etc.\n\nOn the Monday version of \"Summer Vacation\" I added \"Travel or go on a vacation\", so on the first day of Summer Vacation they'll want to travel somewhere (either I take them to a beach in Sulani or I'll have them actually take a full vacation). For example, a perfect \"Summer Vacation\" week will have them on Monday travel to a beach or go to a vacation rental for the week, go swimming/play in the water, enjoy some grilled food, and end the day by enjoying a bonfire. Tuesday-Friday don't include the travel/vacation tradition, so you don't actually have to go somewhere every day, you can just take a vacation at the beginning of the week and stay at the vacation house for the rest of the week, or just take a day trip to the beach on the first day of vacation and then enjoy water fun, grilling out and a bonfire at home. \n\nIt's also nice to give child sims a weeklong break from school during the summer, and to give adults with a career a reason to actually take time to travel and go do something besides work and go home!",
