Being a member of the EA creator network, so you get paid when someone types in your username at checkout? Again, that money is coming from EA.

Does it work? Yay.\n\nNo? Uninstall and reinstall the game.\n\nDoes it work now? I hope so\n\nThen, copy and paste the Sims 4 folder back into documents > electronic arts (there will be a new folder named that when you reinstall the game. Just delete the new one and replace with your old one)",
