            "body": "Ok, so if you are new to the Sims, have no other packs and can only get one expansion, I'd recommend City Living. It adds a lot of game play, has a fun interactive world, and just adds a lot of life to the game.\n\nBut, if you already have a few packs that add game play and new worlds, I'd recommend Seasons. It has some unique game play, but it's best quality is just the added ambiance and sense of time progression it brings to the game. It makes the game feel more grounded and complete, but might not offer enough on it's own if you currently find the game a little boring.\n\nNow if I had to go back to base game and decide what order to re-add these 6 expansions, this would be my list and why I like them:\n\n1. City Living - Apartments, festivals, world\n\n2. Get Together - Clubs, world, DJ booth\n\n3. Seasons - Weather, holidays, flower arranging\n\n4. Get To Work - Science career, retail lots, aliens\n\n5. Cats & Dogs - Pets, world\n\n6. Get Famous - Acting career, fame system",

            "body": "Personal order based on how often I use its features (incl. world, CAS, build/buy, gameplay etc):\n\n1 Cats & Dogs - I can't imagine playing the Sims without pets available, and in my opinion Brindleton Bay is one of the most beautiful worlds. \n\n2 City Living - I use the food stalls and apartments quite a lot (I don't own For Rent and don't plan to until it gets properly fixed). The city setting is refreshing.\n\n3 Seasons - I like CAS for this pack and how the seasons apply to each world; though the calendar (one of its USPs) got moved to base game and I find that's quite a blow to its ranking.\n\n4 Get Together - Clubs are useful to keep track of groups of sims and Windenburg is a great, massive world. Not as full of gameplay as the top two though.\n\n5 Get Famous - I love the build/buy and CAS as well as the celebrity gameplay... when I actually want celebrities. I think if EA would refresh the pack, I'd like them to review how relatives of famous sims can speak to them. My sim's 5-star celeb grandfather should be able to talk to his grandkids without them getting flustered, okay?! \n\n6 Get To Work - It's not at the bottom because it's \"bad\", it's more that it got left behind as the first ever pack released and badly needs to be updated or have its price permanently slashed. I primarily got it for the active careers but they're broken now (the robot thing for scientist comes to mind), and aliens are lacking. Compared to the other supernaturals, aliens (and mermaids frankly) are more... half-occults.",

It has some fun new activities like skating, beekeeping, water balloon fight, snowman building etc. plus the holidays which you can fully customize.\n\n2. Cats and Dogs - another must have to be honest, pets are a big part of human and sims life alike and without them it feels like something is missing.\n\n3. City living - the world from this pack is quite unique and offers an alternative place to live instead of just a small town. Festivals are fun and makes the world feel much more alive.\n\n4. Get to Work - offers careers where you can actually follow your sim at work. There are not that many of them but it is a nice alternative. It does include some regular gameplay like illness system or hospital births.\n\n5. Get Together - okay so the big features here are club system, nightclubs and partying but the club system can be used for any activity really, you can make a baking club, desperate housewifes club or just make a family club and use it for big family gatherings. Pretty useful feature.\n\n5. Get Famous - it gets last place because how niche its gameplay is. You will likely not have all of your sims to be famous actors, but nice to have that option.",

Get to Work - I just really love playing as sciency characters and the addition of Sixam is great. I also love all the mods that came out of GTW. \n\n2. City Living - the world is great, the festivals are great any time I go (I could do without all the spam calls). I love how versatile apartments are.\n\n3. Get Together - Clubs system is great especially for legacy and rotational play. Windenburg is a top tier world. Especially for it's size.\n\n4. Seasons - great for the added realism, but I hate all the changes it's introduced to things like gardening over the years. It's a great addition to gameplay, but it's not a must have as a first pack. \n\n5. Cats and Dogs - I love the idea of pets, but I'm a bad pet owner, cause they tend to get neglected and run away. I hardly use what the pack for anything outside of the BB and simply owning a pet. \n\n6. Get Famous - This is my most accidentally used pack in the fact that my sims get famous without me even trying, and then immediately get the Emotion Bomb quirk cause someone died or the pet ran away. I know I can turn it off, but usually I just forget. And my sims gain fame in the background. I rarely doing the acting career, and don't even touch Del Sol Valley. In terms of worlds, that one is one of my least favorites next to magnolia promenade, which hardly has a purpose.",

I can finally add my IRL passed away pets into the game and spending time together!\n\nSeasons - Another good expansion. But sadly the life of sims it took away was way more then the fun it brought in my gameplay ( i have no choice but to turn off the thunderstorm and bilzzard)\n\nGet Famous - Being a Celebrity is fun but it drove me crazy when it makes my sims keeps being sad because she became a 1-star celebrity unintentionally and become a nobody again by losing fame naturally over and over.",

            "body": "I voted for City Living before realizing that Seasons was on here \ud83d\ude2d but tbh, I stand by that (though the two are very close for me)\n\n1. City Living - provides the most varied gameplay, world, CAS, food options, etc. if you're coming from just the Base Game. Even if you're not a city dweller like I am in real life, it gives you a new place for your Sims to vacation and try new experiences. It was also the main source of diverse gameplay for a while. I'd definitely recommend this as the first expansion pack anyone should get (at least if you're only planning on getting a few/stretching them out).\n2. Seasons - number 2, but for a while it was my number 1. I'm from the US Northeast so 4 seasons are a must for me. Seasonal gameplay really transforms all the worlds you have. Yes, it affects gardening, but there are so many other cool aspects of the Sims 4 that I don't know why people discourage others from getting Seasons for that reason. Holidays and the expanded calendar are also vital. \n3. Get Together - clubs, caf\u00e9s, and Windenburg. What more do you need? Definitely the most underrated expansion pack, though I will say that I'm not crazy about the build/buy. Really love the Euro nightlife theme.\n4. Get Famous - tbh, Get Famous has some of the ugliest build/buy in the game. It's so garish! But I do love the fame/reputation system, and I consider it essential for my personal gameplay. I also love just how expansive it is--you can get famous for most things in the game! And sure, Del Sol Valley is a bit of a disappointment, but I like the sunny LA vibe.\n5. Cats and Dogs - I'm coming clean as someone who doesn't love pets. Didn't grow up with them, never cared much for cats and dogs (still don't). Though I own the pack, and I do love my main family's dog, it's low on this list for me. Brindleton Bay is a nice world (certainly one of the closest to where I grew up irl), but it does get rainy with Seasons and is chock-full of strays. If you like coastal areas and seafood, this is definitely the pack to get.\n6. Get to Work - I feel bad for GTW because it's so obvious that it's the first expansion pack. It's dated, the contents don't have a clear vision (retail and active careers and aliens...huh?), and Magnolia Promenade is Willow Creek part 2. Some mods do use it as a dependency, though, so it's not a completely useless pack. And if you want to run your own shop, or be a doctor, or live in Willow Creek the sequel, then have at it!",

            "body": "This is an interesting question, because I have to recommend a pack that ISN'T my favorite here.\n\n1. Seasons - This pack honestly adds THE MOST to the game between seasons, weather, and the holiday calendar system. It's a lot of gameplay, and even though it doesn't come with a world, it definitely makes the game play way differently than base game alone. That's not even including all of the additions like plants and the floral skill. This is why I have to recommend it.\n\n2. Cats & Dogs - This adds lots of new gameplay like the pets, the vet job, plus a great new world. It's not as interesting as Seasons, but pets do flesh out things a bit more. Plus, it's a pre-requisite if you want My First Pets Stuff.\n\n3. Get Famous - The Fame mechanic is kinda fun to play around with, and it permeates into so many aspects of gameplay, so you're going to encounter it at some point and might even capitalize off of it. The streaming devices are fun to play around with, as is the acting career. The world is a little small, but it's still got a quite nice vibe to it.\n\n4. Get Together - The club mechanic I suppose is fine? I barely ever use it, but folks do enjoy it for making get togethers, and it was the backbone for a lot of other systems like Businesses and Hobbies, but it is something pretty unique and can really change how you play the game. Windenberg is a fantastic world though with tons of lots.\n\n5. City Living - This is my actual favorite, but the mechanics of this pack have been cannibalized all over the place, so it's not adding much to the game aside from a new world (though San Myshuno IS my favorite world). The festivals are quite fun, but the original draw of the pack - lot traits and apartments - got absorbed into the base game and other packs, and even the festival concept is used frequently for other packs like Snowy Escape and Life and Death. For the world alone, I love it, but unfortunately the gameplay is a minimal upgrade.\n\n6. Get to Work - This is the first pack, and it quite frankly stinks. It added a really tiny world, 3 active careers, and the ability to own retail. It's overall such a lackluster improvement in the gameplay department that got copied/absorbed into other packs with the further addition of active careers, and Businesses and Hobbies pulls off retail ownership a little better, at least in my experience so far. This pack desperately needs a refresh so that it's worthy of being a proper expansion pack since it just isn't comparable to anything that released after it.",
