Yes\n\nGame Version: Most recent update\n\nDescription:\n\nI am having an extremely annoying glitch where Sims are getting stuck T posing/glitching at the spawn point on every single lot including my house. Like they are completely static except for their arms T posing every second. Then it just repeats. Random sims too. I cannot reset them using cheats, it doesn\u2019t work, and I even turned all my mods off to see if it was something to do with that and it\u2019s not. I have never had this problem before but I\u2019m not sure what else to do about it. This only started this morning too, the only new thing I have is the new pack. When I click on them, it gives me the normal pie interaction menu but when I press talk to or gossip etc it just automatically erases it from the queue. Like they aren\u2019t actually on the lot or something.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i0oe3bz71ane1.jpeg?width=1310&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=048a18819d5b665a3768409958d36af83c322db8\n\nI also have a video of it, but can\u2019t upload it as a comment.\n\nEdit: The only fix I\u2019ve found is I have to add them to my household, then Modify in CAS and they get unstuck. And all of them almost died because their needs ARE going down.\n\nEdit 2: I completely removed Businesses and Hobbies from my game and it now seems to be working fine again. So, not sure if it\u2019s an actual glitch because of the pack or a mod conflicts with it even though I turned them off, removed them from my folder and cleared the cache and it was still doing it. I think it\u2019s something to do with the pack.",

Any other options? This started less than a week ago but beore the new burglar update was announced.",

I noticed that the columns mod wasnt working and that whenever i tried to remove a cloth item in cas, it wouldn't come off. \nAfter some time, the game would crash. Mainly, when i equipped or removed items.\n\nThis isn't really game related, but it also broke my Sims Ripper. When I tried to export my sims, their face was just completely gone.\n\nI tried to put my mods in a different folder, and the game worked flawlessly. I guess it's just a thing with mods that we will have to wait out unless someone figured a solution yet..",

I should mention i only very recently got literally one mod and a decent amount of CC. So for years i was playing with no mods and my computer always freezes and then restarts or it will just restart without freezing when i play sims. I have tried to redownload, adjusting settings, and all the basic things to try to fix it. And my PC is not a bad/cheap computer. I can play games of all sorts with no issues on my PC. Including more demanding games. So I\u2019m lost on what to do. Sometimes my pc does this really fast, sometimes it takes hours. It\u2019s really random and it\u2019s never been because of something I\u2019m doing in game it\u2019s always at random times, no actions seem to cause it. \nNow since I\u2019ve gotten cc it does this restarting thing in CAS more which that can be bad cc causing that part of it i know that. But regardless it always does this normally anyway and i know my pc is capable of running a game like this and i never see anyone online anywhere saying this happens to them.\n\n  Does anyone have this problem or know why it could be doing this? I know something is causing it but don\u2019t know what. Please send any help because i have been struggling to play for years and i really like the game.",

I can still switch between build and buy mode, the sound affects are still there, and I can move/rotate the screen.

If I try to save, it just spins forever without doing anything.

It doesn\u2019t stay fully red either, it stays empty, I can have them kiss, etc, but I cannot have them woohoo or try for a baby because of this.

For some clarity, (1) the problem is the drop down menu won't give me any others to click to. I can place a different venue type from the gallery but once I do, when i go into the lot from Manage Worlds it changes back to the Onsen Bathhouse lot type no matter what the venue was from the gallery. (2) I have tried the Generic glitch roundabout fix where you have a family buy the lot as retail and then sell it and try to change it to your preferred venue that way but then my lot got stuck as being retail with no other options to change it to. So i reverted my save and now I'm stuck at Onsen again. (3) No sim owns this lot, It was a bathhouse community lot that i'm trying to replace and make a residential (vacation rental) but it never stays when i go into build mode from the gallery. Has anyone found a fix to this glitch?? I did update my game to the most recent patch right when it dropped(1.113.227.1030), I've turned off and removed all my mods, and I've also cleared my cache. All posts i can find where people have my problem are all from years ago and the solution doesn't work for this version of the game anymore..\n\nEdit: typos, grammar and spacing",

After that, couldn't upload anything from any save file, even the current one. However, it did work with brand new saves. The gallery / library remained accessible and I could download, just not upload. Sorry, this is so long and the solution is \"just don't do it again\", but I was curious whether anyone else had experienced this. At least, it warns people not to be as stupid as I was... Details below:  \n  \nPROBLEM:  \nSo, I attempted to upload a house from a mega old build (save from my old laptop made on Origin, several years old) to my library. I got a \u201cserver error\u201d and it somehow caused the same persistent error in my other saves\u2026 Was this incredibly stupid? Yes. Was it my fault? Kinda? I mean, I can access the save file and there\u2019s an option to upload the lot\u2026 I CAN upload lots from newly created games, but all existing save games, including the newest ones then develop the same issue (\"Can't connect to Server\"). Doesn\u2019t matter how often you restart, repair or save as, the error remains.\n\nFIX:   \nI deleted the Sims 4 folder and let it generate a new one, adding my saves and a few other bits & bobs back into the new folder. It now works again in the newest save! I\u2019m reticent to go back to the previous save (different story line; a few weeks old) because I don\u2019t want to go through this entire process again. I did experiment with putting in only the old saves, and trying to upload (just to see) and then adding back the new saves, but the error returns for all of them regardless.\n\nQUESTIONS:  \nWhat causes this persistent upload bug? Is there some file that can be deleted rather than having to delete the whole folder? I\u2019m also wondering whether just opening the old saves is enough to cause issues\u2026 Has anyone else experienced this weird bug / error? I guess I\u2019ll just have to screenshot the houses I wanted to upload, create them in new game and the upload them to the library that way. I\u2019m just scared to even go back to older, yet still fairly new saves (made on the new computer on the EA App) in case it goes pear-shaped again\u2026\n\nRESULTS:\n\nWhat I found out is:\n\nA) the issue stems solely from trying to upload a house from a mega old save  \nB) even with no other saves in the folder, once the attempt is made, it is impossible to upload to the gallery / library from any existing save regardless of how old it is  \nC) it will work from a completely new game every time (before and after folder regeneration)\n\n\n\nTo quote *Burn After Rreading*:  \nCIA Superior: What did we learn, Palmer?  \nCIA Officer: I don't know, sir.  \nCIA Superior: I don't \\[friggin'\\] know either. I guess we learned not to do it again.",

            "body": "Platform: PC  \nMods/CC: Yes to both  \nGame version: 1.112.519.1020 DX11 (haven't done the most recent update yet)\n\nI'm having an issue and I'm unsure if it's related to a mod or not. I created a new household with 4 sims, who are all partners (it's a polyamorous household) and I set everyone's relationship jealousy settings to 'no' in CAS. I also used WW to give them all the polyamorous trait since almost immediately two of the sims got the betrayal/caught cheating moodlet + relationship bit pretty much as soon as I loaded them into the lot. Neither of them are my bugged sim in question.\n\nOne of the other members of the household I've designed to be a weird creature vampire, who I also gave the socially avoidant trait in WW (removing this trait hasn't helped). Basically the bug is that every social interaction with this sim, no matter who, will at some point have the red negative relationship symbol pop up alongside a thought bubble with the red \ud83d\udeab symbol over their face. This happens with EVERYONE, including their own partners who they have very high friendship and romance levels with, Grim Reaper (their boss and current main love interest), their own baby they just gave birth to, and in one instance the very dead Nina Caliente while on a reaper job.\n\nI cannot figure out what is causing everyone to dislike this sim, and it happening with Nina makes me think that it's definitely a glitch. I've removed any WW traits and the sinister impression from this sim using cheats, and that hasn't fixed it. I'm sick of their relationship constantly going down with their partners and family for no apparent reason. The sim also doesn't have a negative reputation and is actually around good/great.\n\nIs this a known vampire glitch or something? I'll admit I don't often actually do much gameplay, I usually just build houses and make sims in CAS. (I've also got the glitch where vampire traits like eyes/teeth applied in CAS immediately don't save and disappear as soon as I go back into live mode, no matter how many times I reapply it using cas.fulleditmode. Unsure if this is related)\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!",

First it started with the entire bottom toolbar (where you can switch control of each Sim in the household, check their needs, etc.) not showing up.\n\nIt got resolved since then, but the quest UI at the top left is glitched and I can't switch between quests, and going into CAS or starting a new game just leaves me with the infinite loading screen / the white screen of death. Manage Worlds is also bugged in that none of the buttons appear in the bottom right corner when I click on a played household.\n\nAdditionally, when I try to travel, the list of Sims that pops up isn't centered on the screen and is just a blank scroll menu, which I can't even close out of as the \"X\" does nothing (this goes for all pop-ups that appear too, they're just stuck on my screen).\n\nI've checked and double checked my mods and deleted the \"problem\" ones (also got rid of the localthumbcache file), and I repaired the game multiple times on the EA app, but these bugs still persist.

I'm still trying to work out the mechanics and googling things I don't understand, but I can't find an answer to this one.\n\nI recently bought a hot tub for my sim (he got to MVP, he deserves it) and of course, as one does, I invite my super casual fwb J Huntington over to...test it out. It all went swimmingly (hoho!) but now suddenly he can't woohoo in the actual bed.\n\nThe option is there when I click the bed but nothing happens when I click it, and when talking to J it always defaults to woohoo in the hot tub, which is fine but it's 2am and they're standing next to the bed in their sweats. I thought maybe he was too tired so they went to sleep, and now it's the morning and they still can't?! They're both super flirty, making out like teenagers but can't do the deed in the bed that's 3 feet away.\n\nThey can definitely both get in, the dog is snoozing in the other room so that's not an problem. They've eaten, peed, their friend and love bars are maxxed and they're woohoo partners, but still when I click the woohoo option on the bed nothing goes into my queue.\n\nHelp?!\n\n\\[FIXED\\] - Never mind, discovered it was that weird 'can't woohoo if the bed is against the wall' glitch. I wonder if that'll ever get fixed...",

I'm currently having issues with just opening the sims 4 period.\n\nMy computer is just for the sims and school atm so I've never really had any issues. once my mods folder got bulky i decided on having a hard drive as a back up in case it causes issues. its an HDD and yes I know SSD is better but they are crazy expensive and i do not play this game enough to get something that is just for extra space at such a high price.\n\nafter the two most recent patches i just couldn't get into the game at all. at first the ea app would crash all over the place, log me out, make me redownload the game, so i figured it was a storage issue and created a symlink w my hardrive.\n\nit was successful so I gradually started add my mods folder back bit by bit in case broken cc was the issue. but I checked all of my cc, and I'm rechecking it for like the 50th time and I've trashed and/or replaced anything outdated and my mods folder is organized organized like down to age, gender, type of mod, etc. and the only folder - which admittedly i wish i sorted beforehand because it was very tedious to stifle through - is a folder of new cc that i don't organize in the event my game has issues and it is called \"toxic\". So with this toxic folder it appeared that as soon as I remove it the game would run fairly normal from what i see. So my immediate assumption was oh ofc its bad cc let me find it. I split it into about 4 sections since its pretty big and trashed them in big groups of things that were either questionable or out of date. but surprisingly I found nothing that was out of date, so i had a lot more of the questionable cc removed. which is interesting because i had more out of date cc to remove outside of the toxic folder rather than inside. so I'm so confused as to why its causing such a weird occurrence\n\nSo far I just get a white screen or I'm stuck on that obnoxiously blue ts4 opening screen when I load my mods folder in full. I've removed cache, generated a new mods folder, and repaired EA games and ts4 but to no avail. It runs about the same as if the toxic folder wasn't in there.\n\nSo I'm just wondering if anyone else is having a similar issue?? maybe a broken piece of cc??? a mod?? would appreciate any help :'( tysm\n\n  \nedit: also I have a weird new cache I've literally never seen in my folder in my like 8 years of playing called \"localsimtexturecache.package\" if that means anything",

So I can't offer any personal experience on this issue or any verified solutions.\n\nWhat I've heard is that by the time you encounter the symptoms of corruption, there's not much you can do, but honestly, that may or may not be true, because I hear lots of conflicting statements about all sorts of Sims gameplay.\n\nIf you value the Save at risk, I think it's worth at least trying to salvage it.\n\nIdeally, you have backups of the file before it started having issues. I tend to keep at least at least a month or two worth of backups on my saves, just in case I need to backtrack. If you have a backup, you may be able to open that Save and prune away all excess content.\n\nBut let's say you don't have a backup from before the problems. Here's what I would try:\n\n1. Make a backup of the current Save and put it somewhere safe. This archive file gives you unlimited salvage attempts to restore functionality.\n2. Move out your Mods folder. Wouldn't hurt to move out Screenshots. The less file noise, the better.\n3. Open the Save in whatever world actually still works. Bulldoze any lot that isn't being used by your Active family. Or, at the very least, just start deleting anything but the MOST basic furniture needed: toilet, shower, bed, and a cooler for food. Think of it as Riches to Rags.\n4. Save and close. Then open the save again through Load Game, which brings you to the Manage Worlds/Households menu. Pull up Manage Households and delete all NPC sims you can spare, plus any Active Households you've stopped playing.\n5. Save and close. Then open again the same way and try to select a relatively undeveloped world, one that you didn't really use for gameplay. If you can get to it, raze every editable lot.\n6. Rinse and repeat #5 and remove as many houses as you can that aren't directly related to your gameplay.\n7. Try and play your active family and see if they can move around now.",

I got the new pack last night and everything was going well until my game crashed while my sim was getting a tattoo from spilled neon. (\ud83d\ude29) Since then, I tried to reload my save and everything worked fine, but for some reason spilled neon will now not open and be functional for my sim. I even tried switching to their household to open the business, then switching back to my household and it\u2019s still closed. Has anyone run into this issue or is it a feature? From what i can tell the owner is inside the store and its the middle of the day. This new business system has been a little confusing for me so any help is appreciated! It doesnt feel like a bugand more so just me not doing it right lol, but i havent seen anyone else with the issue.\u201d",

It was the 4th day of winter (which is usually a Wednesday iirc) and past 4pm when I saved before the update, but when I loaded the game it was 9am on Sunday. I also had the discovery quests popping up even though I've been playing in this save file for around a year. The only cause I can think of is that I accidentally had the less frequent proms mod and calendar tweaks installed at the same time before the update, but when this happened I only had calendar tweaks installed. Even after removing calendar tweaks, the dates are still off. If anyone knows how to fix this pls lmk!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vv5njhltycne1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=84e7e3d4168621b0dae968df5d4992c91fea5cff",

In programs like plum buddy etc. it seems that all my mods and scripts are ok, but when I want to put flowers on the floor, those from custom content as well as those from the original game, the game seemingly continues to work, but when I want to save it, it stutters. There is no rule about which flower it is about. Sometimes the flower works and the game will save, and sometimes I put a flower and can't save the game because the save icon keeps spinning. I noticed that this happens with flowers placed on the floor. With shelf and ceiling and wall flowers, everything is ok.\n\nHas anyone ever had this problem and is able to help me. I have a lot of custom content and mods, but I always know how to find the file that is messing up my game.

She's stuck at school and even if I don't join her, she stays at school for days on end. The only way to get her out is to travel to another location with her. It makes the gameplay very messy and frustrating. She also has the Admired Icon aspiration, and one of her goals is to get 10 teenage friends. She already has 8 teenage friends, yet none of these show up as fulfilling the goal bar. \"0/10 teenage friends\". I don't know what to do with her. I've tried removing all mods and still have the same issue. I'm not having this issue with any of my other sims, but her. I've tried resetting her, removing her from the family, and repairing the game. I tried saving her in the gallery and uploading her to the same family, but the issue remains.

I'd redecorated the entire downstairs, outside, and even changed foundations, porches, roofs, and placement of the house on the lot.\n\nI had TOOL installed but was becoming annoyed at having to find items I wanted through unorganised debug, so I saved and exitted my game, deleted TOOL, and deleted all but 17 remaining items of build CC (I had saved my game multiple times while building/decorating at this point).\n\nI reentered my game and the lot only for the game to tell me 200 items had been removed and the lot had reverted back to how it was before I started (foundations, roofs, landscaping, layout and things I had deleted were all back too). All my packs are still available in build and buy and - for some reason - debug is still open.\n\nI tried recovering the save to my last save point and disabled mods, but nothing worked. I can see the house on the map looks as it did when I last saved, but I reenter, and everything goes back to how it was before I started, and I don't know why. This isn't a case of CC just being missing. Full ROOMS have moved to places where they had been before, and the roof changed shaped! I REALLY don't want to build this house again, so if anyone knows how to fix it, I will be eternally grateful.",

After a lot of back and forth trying to fix it, I ended up just buying a new laptop. This laptop has been working great - more storage, can create new files, etc. The issue is that after I re-signed into OneDrive, all of my files were still there, just corrupted (including all of my game files). I cannot delete or move the corrupted files, and because of this, I cannot play the Sims. I get an error telling me that game data is missing or damaged. I have tried repairing the game, uninstalling and reinstalling, and sending my Sims 4 folder that was not corrupted from my iPhone's OneDrive app to my laptop and saving those. Nothing seems to work, and I do not know how to fix this issue. Ideally, there would be a way for Sims to create all new folders. I don't care much about my old saves, and I'm assuming my packs will all be safe since they are linked to my EA account - I just want to play! Does anybody know how to fix this error?",

I have even older versions of this save I can try, but they're from before the new pack came out so I'm not sure if it will help me narrow anything down.

My game seemed fine prior, so I just let it repair and left it alone. I was playing today and my game randomly decided to just- not load? I waited for about 10 minutes before just giving up, and when I got out of the game it said it needed repairs again. Has this happened to anyone else, or is there maybe something wrong with my computer?\nFor context I had updated MCCC yesterday before playing, so I\u2019m not sure if that had anything to do with it or not. I don\u2019t think I even did anything else except maybe open another game for a few minutes or looking things up online. \nPlease help!! If I something is wrong with my computer I\u2019d like to get it fixed asap!!",

It's not listed in CAS, although it shows up on her, so I'm not able to remove it there. Just today, I noticed that it is now appearing on Tina Tinker, whom I have never before played with or even edited in CAS. This just started showing up after the March update, but before the release of B&H, so there was no tattoo parlor in game at the time.\n\nI've scoured the Internet and haven't found anyone mentioning this particular tattoo. Bug? Feature? Mod thing? She doesn't have any weird traits or moodlets. I do have MCCC and WW installed, along with a few other small mods and the good amount of CC.\n\nSo my question is this: Does anyone have any idea where this may have come from? Before I go sifting through all of my mods and CC and doing the time-consuming half/half test, it would be great if I had some educated guesses to work with. \ud83d\ude42",

Previously, I had NEVER had an abduction in all the years that I've owned the game (I didn't even know they had implemented them into Sims 4 with Get To Work because I literally had never seen one happen, and I've owned the game around since at least 2016-ish?) I even previously had families with astronauts and scientists who maxed out their careers, and nothing ever happened. I know it sounds newb-ish to say I had no idea that the abductions were added so long ago, but I get super out of the loop sometimes and I tend to play the same way all the time so I don't often get surprised by the game. But now the abductions are happening which I was pretty happy about at first but not only are they now present in my game but they are taking over my game. They have me on edge because I have to shift-click-reset my sims every other night to keep them from checking out the lights. I looked online and it seems like they don't happen as often for most players?\n\nMy sims get abducted at *least* once every sim week, if not more often. I play in a rotational legacy format and in the family I'm on currently the father has been singled out and abducted 5 times (I've been playing them for about two IRL days, for reference). This family is a bunch of ranchers, none of them have assigned careers of ANY variety, they just train horses and make nectar. There are no telescopes, they use the cheapest computer and use it minimally, they don't even watch the sky from park benches. They live in the world that comes with the horses expansion pack and have very little interaction with technology, and none of them are friends with any aliens. As far as I can tell there is nothing about them that should make them targets to have increased alien interactions.\n\nI saw online that through the satellite you can have a scientist turn abductions off, but I was hoping there's a way to minimize them? I was so happy to see that they were in the game, if I could keep them I would love that, I just can't have them every other night. I used to love having my sims frolic around outside at night, there's tons to do at night especially with the new death pack. But now with the alien lights I'm like a prison warden and I had to delete all but one door in my houses so I could babysit my sims and keep them inside. No more moon-bathing, no more building skills at night with the night-owl trait, no more bonfires, no more fishing in the dark... RIP me.\n\n  \nTLDR: Too many alien abductions, how to limit them without turning off completely?",

I've been trying to play as another household that sim A is friends with, and I have these friends invite my sim over.

I have completed the first two weeks of the event but when I activated the part on my Sim\u2019s computer, the computer didn\u2019t break. The next task is to repair or replace the computer. I figured I would just wait for another computer to break and fix that one. But it\u2019s been about a week now and none of the computers in any of my households have broken, when previously they seemed to break daily. I play rotationally so I have about 10 active households and not a single one has had a computer break in the past week which is unheard of for me. Is there something i can do to force complete the task or break a computer so that i can complete it?",
