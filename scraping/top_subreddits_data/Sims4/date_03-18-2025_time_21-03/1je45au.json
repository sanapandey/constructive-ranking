My gen 2 heir is working on her career in politics in the charity branch, trying to make the world a better place right now. Otherwise, they can focus on their family, aspirations, or socializing.\n\nAnd I like taking them on fun vacations. I was so proud of them recently when they were able to climb to the top of Mount Komorebi. They worked so hard getting in tip top shape to make the climb. Minus the twins.
