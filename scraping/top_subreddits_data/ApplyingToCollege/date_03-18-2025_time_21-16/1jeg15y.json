    "selftext": "I\u2019m your typical high achieving, A2C nervous wreck. I applied to a lot of colleges (more reaches than I should\u2019ve or thought)\u2026 long story short so far I got rejected from all my targets/reaches and accepted into my 3 safeties. To add insult to injury, both of my grandparents, parents, and siblings attended Ivy/T25. I still have Ivy Day so hope isn\u2019t totally lost, but I\u2019m freaking pumped to be going to my safety + I can go for basically free. At the end of the day, I truly believe rejection is redirection and even though I have had some heartbreaking decisions I\u2019ve come to love and accept my limited options for school. The glass is always half full!!!!",
