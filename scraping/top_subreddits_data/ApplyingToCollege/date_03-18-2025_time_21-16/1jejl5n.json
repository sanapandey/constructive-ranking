All they talk about is how bad the smell is and how the town is \"isolated\" from big cities but they never bring up how uc davis is ranked above uci, sb, Merced, riverside, and Santa cruz (according to the uc website). My classmates look at me in disgust whenever I asked if they applied to davis. They say, \"ew, I would never go to that cow school.\" Meanwhile get rejected by all the ucs...like tf is wrong w u",

Only Berkeley was acceptable and UCSD was target. \n\nThose who think of it low think too highly of themselves.\nAnd it\u2019s crazy for people to think 37% acceptance rate is high. 102,000 undergrads applied this year, if it remains 37% acceptance, that\u2019s 64,260 rejection letters. Only 37740 accepted and more than half is out of state and international\u2026 so\u2026 how is that in good odds getting into? I get UCs can only have 18-23% international students. Even so, that\u2019s a lot of yes\u2019 to non CA kids. \n\nMy child applies. Amazing stats. UCD has amazing forensic pathology track that allows for double major in CS. She toured the campus. It was her jam. Denied. She will apply there for med school.",
