Why do you want to be a moderator of A2C?\n2. Do you have any experience being a reddit moderator or a community leader? If so, briefly elaborate. \n3. If you answered yes to being a reddit mod, do you have any skills or knowledge of reddit specific tools, such as automod configuration? If so, elaborate. This question is optional, and we do not expect our new mods to have these skills. It's just a nice bonus for us if so.\n4. What year of school are you in? (e.g., HS Senior, college sophomore, college graduate, etc)\n5. Are you a professional admissions consultant or AO? If not, elaborate on your relationship to college admissions, e.g., I'm currently a senior who applied\n6. What is the primary device you use to browse reddit?\n7. Approximately how many hours a week do you spend on reddit?\n8. What time zone are you in? \n9. Briefly explain any ideas you might have to improve the sub. This question is optional.",
