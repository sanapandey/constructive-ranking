He thinks it is less.\n\nI told him we can only pay for tuition whether at UCI or UCSD. He is thinking about taking out a student loan. My son has never had a job in his life. He's 18.  I feel bad I can't afford to pay for his housing costs.  However,  he's 18 and getting into debt for an ungrad degree is not wise.  Is UCSD that much better than UCI to the point that getting into $80k debt for housing is worth it for a bio undergrad degree?\n\nThanks for any thoughts/input.",
