    "selftext": "Here\u2019s a story I saw time and again as an Admissions Officer:\u00a0\n\nI\u2019d sit down with an application with a straight A transcript but only a handful of AP classes. Despite the student\u2019s GPA, the lack of AP classes would knock their academic rating down to the point where they were no longer competitive for admissions.\u00a0\n\nExample: If Charlie has a 4.0 but has only taken 3 AP courses throughout high school and Taylor has a 3.92 but will have taken 12 APS by the time they graduate\u2014Taylor is likely the more competitive candidate (academically at least).\u00a0\n\nEven if they were involved in some cool extracurriculars and had great grades, Charlie\u2019s lack of rigor took them out of the running.\u00a0\n\nIf you look at the [CDS data at University of Virginia](https://ira.virginia.edu/sites/g/files/jsddwu1106/files/2023-2024-V3.1%20CDS_FINAL_508.pdf), 90% of admitted students had a gpa of 4.0.\u00a0\n\nIn a sea of As, rigor becomes *the* distinguishing factor.\u00a0\n\n# How is rigor evaluated?\n\nRigor isn\u2019t just some abstract concept\u2014it\u2019s something that admission offices actually rate, usually on a 1-5 scale:\n\n* 1 \u2013 Less than Demanding\n* 2 \u2013 Somewhat Demanding\n* 3 \u2013 Demanding\n* 4 \u2013 Very Demanding\n* 5 \u2013 Most Demanding\n\nAt top-20 schools, most admitted students have a 5, which means they have either maxed out the amount of APs they were allowed to take or their courseload looked on par with classmates who were taking the most rigorous courseloads.\u00a0\n\nA 4 is likely to impact an academic rating but might still be competitive if combined with near-perfect grades, top-class rank, strong indicators of intellectual curiosity, and other very compelling non-academic factors.\u00a0\n\nA 3 or below? That typically means an uphill battle.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you have to take 15 APs to be competitive. Rigor is judged in context. If your school offers 4 APs and you take all 4, you\u2019re getting a \"Most Demanding\" rating.\u00a0\n\nBut if your school offers 20+ APs and you're only taking 4? \u2620\ufe0f(at least at the most competitive schools.)\u00a0\n\nAt competitive high schools, the expectation is that students take as rigorous a courseload as their high-achieving peers. That doesn\u2019t mean you need to take every AP offered, but you need to be in the same ballpark as the students taking the most challenging courses available.\n\n",

If all things (essays, extracurriculars, letters of rec) are equal, the student with the lowest GPA among these 4 (let's say a 3.75) might get squeezed out because, although they have identical rigor, they have the weakest academic profile.\n\nIn actuality, it wouldn't likely come down to a tiny GPA difference\u2014but to those \"soft\" factors like essays, ECs, letters of rec, etc. Academic score gets you in the door, then holistic admissions get you into the class.  \n\nSo all this is to say there isn't really one numeric answer to your question. Or else that the numeric answer is contextual within your high school class and will change from cycle to cycle based on who is applying. This is why we try to emphasize just how much class context matters for thinking through your school list and application strategy.",

Plus the ones they do offer are usually only offered one period and conflict with half of the others.\n\nMy kid took every single one that they could fit into their schedule, and it only ended up being 7 classes (but they independent studied for 2 others and took the exams and did great.) Some other students in their grade were able to take up to 12 depending on what electives and what level of math they were in. My kid was actually penalized by being two years more advanced in math than the \"typical\" honors/AP student in their grade, because the counselors decided what period to offer the majority of the APs based on the TYPICAL students that would enroll and not the higher performers. We tried to fill in with more dual enrollment and even 2 summer community college courses, but I know sometimes that stuff doesn't look as good as APs and makes the school year transcript appear weaker.",

They took DE classes in high school and all had 4.0 in those. None of them ever took the SAT or ACT because I just don\u2019t find it a great metric. All of them got into the schools they applied to with merit scholarships. They attended UT Austin honors, UIUC and one was waitlisted at Rice during Covid for a fully funded PhD. My current college kid is at Pepperdine because Malibu\u2026.duh, but is on the dean\u2019s list there. \n\nSo if there is a parent lurking with a special kind of kid, I don\u2019t want them to think that the public school, AP rigor, high-stakes test route is the only road to success for your student. Some AOs love to see a kid who has done something different.\n\nEditing to add that in Texas and California we homeschooled with a private school affidavit, so their transcripts were considered official private school transcripts.",

There are so many other factors that go into the application besides that C in AP Chem so it's impossible to say how that would impact a decision. But the reality of highly selective admissions is that competitive schools usually have so many applicants that there are enough equally impressive students to fill their class 3 or 4 or 5 times over. There are likely thousands of other applicants who will not have a C in AP chem on their transcript but maybe there is something else incredibly compelling about the applicant with the C in AP chem that keeps them in the running.",

They'll likely have just finished assessing the rigor of a classmate before they look at your transcript. It's not an exact science because everyone does end up having slightly different schedules and also different strengths/interests. Like the applicant who might actually have both AP Spanish and AP French because they love languages and doubled up there but maybe haven't made it to BC calc (or even multivariable calc) like a classmate has. Depending on what the rest of their schedule looks like both of those students could end up getting a 5 rigor! \n\nSenior year schedule is important, especially for highly selective schools. It was good to see an increase in rigor every year and on the flip side it was noticeable when a student \"took their foot off the gas\" senior year. \n\nSome APs are notoriously harder than others,  some indicate you've made it to the end of a sequence and maxed out rigor in a particular subject (like AP French). I would try to align the rigor of your curriculum with the types of major/programs you're applying for. For example, the AP courses you'll want to have if you're applying to engineering programs will look a little different than the types of APs you might focus on if you're applying to selective LACs.",
