    "selftext": "hi everyone, i've been seeing a lot of posts that say they've been rejected/wl/accepted to a UC and then asking what it means for ucla/uc berkeley.\n\nobviously, if you've been admitted -- why would that be a bad sign??\n\nif you weren't admitted -- that's not necessarily any sign... yes sure it could be an indication that your application wasn't strong enough but we need to remember that all UC campuses are operating completely differently - they are looking for different people and thus they are going to admit different types of people\n\nso just to recap: uc admissions are NOT correlated. yes you can take it as a good sign if you've already been admitted to some but if you haven't gotten all the previous UC decisions it doesn't mean end all be all. there are multiple weird uc decision stories online so it really is random but all in all, good luck!!!",
