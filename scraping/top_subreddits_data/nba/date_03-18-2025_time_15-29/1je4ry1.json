    "selftext": "> On Feb. 27, an off day between a game in Houston and a game in Memphis, the Spurs were able to find time for Popovich to speak to his team. The collective weight of Popovich's absence, Wembanyama's devastating news and the long road trip -- they'd been home only twice in a month -- had taken a toll. The Spurs had lost four in a row to drop out of the playoff picture.\n\n> On the practice court at The Rock, Popovich stood in front of his team to deliver a message: He wasn't coming back this season, he told them. But he had been watching them closely and was still in position to hold them accountable for their play.\n\n> \"Everybody shut the fuck up when he walked in,\" Johnson said. \"That's just how it's always been with Pop. Obviously, he's still recovering. But he was still cussing. 'Y'all need to play defense. Y'all need to rebound.' Knowing that, shit, he really is watching the games because he's calling out specific situations, was huge.\"\n\n[Source](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/44254076/pop-decision-earned-gregg-popovich-fight-return-san-antonio-spurs)\n\n",

I was doing ACL rehab and was like 3 days out of surgery doing absolute baby's first exercise type of stuff, and my therapist is like \"whoa I usually don't see people doing this until 2 weeks\", and I'm thinking to myself \"I'm killing this.\" That kept up all through rehab where he kept talking about how far ahead of schedule I was, and I chalked that up to most of his patients not being athletes and just being like... worker's comp type of injuries and whatnot.\n\nBut then I was sometimes getting scheduled with a different therapist, and I would see my old therapist overlapped at the same time with a different patient... and I'd hear him saying the EXACT same stuff he said to me, except his patient was some geriatric who could barely move with a walker. That was when I realized that this type of encouragement is just part of their job, haha",
