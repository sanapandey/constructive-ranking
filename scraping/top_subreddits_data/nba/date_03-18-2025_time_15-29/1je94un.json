Chet shooting motion was super slow so they did not respect his spacing and just sagged and rotated fast if he got open. Jdub got stuffed at the rim so many times as well when driving.\n\nMany of OKC's players just constiniously drove to the rim after catching open 3s and passing up on them and Lively/Gafford/DJJ/PJ all defended the rim well. \n\nMavs basically said, we'll colapse and defend the rim and try and run you off the line if you do get open, unless we think you are a bad shooter then just take it.",
