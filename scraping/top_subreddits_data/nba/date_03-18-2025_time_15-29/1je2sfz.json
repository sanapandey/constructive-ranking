CP's said it's hard not being around his kids since they're based in LA, and he's proven that he can still contribute to winning basketball. Having CP as a backup PG to Luka would basically ensure that Lebron can play off ball full time, and the team would just have a disgustingly high BBIQ in general. Plus he already has a close relationship with JJ. I'm not sure what the Lakers cap situation is like going into the offseason, and obviously they're going to prioritize signing a C, but it really seems like it would be the perfect scenario for all parties.",

Many believed his peak years were with the New Orleans Hornets and the Los Angeles Clippers, but he took his game to another level with the Houston Rockets and the Oklahoma City Thunder. He then elevated his legacy even further by leading the Phoenix Suns to the NBA Finals. After that, he joined the Golden State Warriors to team up with Stephen Curry, and now he\u2019s mentoring Victor Wembanyama in San Antonio with the Spurs. Despite his age, his efficient and effective playing style shows he still has plenty left in the tank. Could a move to the Los Angeles Lakers be next?",
