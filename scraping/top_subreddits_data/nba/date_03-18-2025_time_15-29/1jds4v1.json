    "selftext": "The Dallas Mavericks are\u2014in every way, shape, and form\u2014down bad.\n\nIn addition to fan ire and economic fallout following the trade of superstar Luka Doncic, the team's roster is littered with injuries at the minute, so much so there are concerns they might have to forfeit games if circumstances fall a certain way. There are ways of getting around that; for example, the team could dress and activate an injured player who would never come off the bench. But, with just about $50,000 of room under the first apron hard cap, the front office doesn't have the space to sign anyone new right now, which is also a problem.\n\nSeemingly to that effect, the team has actually asked the NBA for \"relief,\" per a new report from ESPN's Brian Windhorst. Speaking on an episode of Brian Windhorst & The Hoop Collective released Monday, Windhorst said, \"From what I understand, [the Mavs] have asked the league for relief and the league to this point has not offered them relief.\"\n\nThe \"relief\" the team is looking for was not explicitly identified. But in the context of the conversation, however, it would seem Windhorst is saying the Dallas front office wants the league to make an exception and possibly allow them to exceed the first apron, at which they are hard capped, due to extenuating injury circumstances.\n\nBut \"here's the thing,\" countered Tim Bontemps. \"The league can't offer them relief. Because this is why you have hard salary cap limits. If you say, 'Oh, well hey, you had all these injuries, so we're going to let you get away with skipping past this apron to sign players,' all the other teams are gonna understandably go, 'Hey, wait a second. Why are they getting any breaks? Everybody's got to follow the rules.' That's why you leave yourself cushion with these kinds of deals and don't put yourself $50,000 below the apron.\"\n\nhttps://www.ketk.com/sports/sports-illustrated/d8aa5c88/mavs-reportedly-asked-nba-for-salary-cap-relief-amid-injury-struggles/^",

That said, I also agree that the league should not be \"helping\" the Mavericks. For that reason, I would argue that the league should impose a penalty harsh enough that no rational team would put themselves in this position.\n\nFirst, forfeiture of their 2025 first round draft pick for breaking the salary cap. Second, each 10 day contract will require that the Mavericks pay not only the player, but pay out the same amount to every other NBA team. A rookie 10 day contract would cost approximately $65,000. Under these terms, each 10 day contract required would cost the Mavericks a painful $1,950,000. If they want to sign someone with NBA experience, that price doubles or even triples. Keep in mind this is for each contract, if they need more than one 10 day, their wallet takes a hit each time.\n\nThis isn't as harsh as the \"death penalty\" levied on the Timberwolves for the Joe Smith salary cap circumvention attempt, but the loss of a first round draft pick when the team record is in free fall would be painful enough given the team's recent mismanagement. The monetary penalty would be the highest I can recall levied upon an NBA team, but significantly less than what it would end up costing them to forfeit a game.\n\nI would also argue that GM Nico Harrison's contract should be terminated by the league for failure to maintain a functioning NBA roster. Trading Luka was obviously greater on the scale of idiocy, but the Grimes/Martin trade was more irresponsible in terms of threat to NBA operations as usual.",

My guess is his next contract is going to be in the 15-20M range which probably  have made him the 3rd highest paid Maverick. We really weren't going to be able to afford him.

Just give yourself a buffer from the hard cap and you can roll out terrible G-leaguers non-stop.
