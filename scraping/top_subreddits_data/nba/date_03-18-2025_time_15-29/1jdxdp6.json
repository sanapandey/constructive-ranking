If he was arrogant and feels insecure of all the nasty comments about his game, he could have easily lived off his allowance and make his own mini league dominating college or washed hoopers. It wud be televised and he cus both get money from that and brag about his skill punishing non pro athletes but noooo he is okay being laughed at or being dissed for being in the nba.

I don't think most people would notice he exists if he wasn't lebron's son and didn't have lebron's son type expectations.\n\nYeah I mean, people do no effort in calibrating for his draft position or bench position.\n\nHe's played 20 games and averages 4.7 minutes per game.\n\nLet's compare to something like the Blazers bench. Rayan Rupert has played 41 games and is averaging 7.5 minutes per game. Bryce McGowens has played 11 games and is averaging 2.5 minutes per game. So somewhere between those two players.\n\nMcGowens was the 40th overall pick in 2022. Rupert was the 43rd pick in 2023. So both of those guys were drafted slightly ahead of Bronny's 55th pick.\n\nBronny's Per 36 numbers are generally better than Rupert's across the board.\n\nRupert is averaging 10.4 points, 5.4 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 0.9 steals, and 0.2 blocks per 36.\nBronny is averaging 12.6 points, 3.8 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 1.9 steals, and 0.8 blocks per 36.\n\nThey both have the same VORP of -0.2. They are basically both on the cusp of being a \"replacement level\" player by statistical definition.\n\nAre either one of them great players? No, of course not. But acting like Bronny is performing any differently than other bottom of the bench second rounders is odd. Because he's not really doing anything different than a lot of these guys.\n\nCould find plenty of example of exactly the same thing on tons of teams. But not really worth anyone spending much time on it. Like does anyone actually care what Pat Spencer is doing on GSW playing 6.7 MPG over 31 games and averaging 2.6 points a game as an undrafted sophomore? I doubt it. But he's getting more minutes than Bronny and is an objectively bad NBA player.",

I\u2019m an Oregon alum and fan, and Bronny and Oregon\u2019s PG, Jackson Shelstad, have a pretty tight history with each other through high school tournaments and camps. Shelstad has always had the upper hand on Bronny- and that became super clear after their freshman years in the PAC 12. You didn\u2019t see Shelstad declare for the NBA, did you? He won\u2019t declare after this year either.\n\nAll I\u2019m saying is that Bronny would be a four year college player if his dad wasn\u2019t LeBron. He probably would have started at most schools starting his junior year, but maybe not so at the elite of the elite schools. It doesn\u2019t matter if every player in the history of the NBA was a bust at #55- he didn\u2019t deserve the opportunity to bust.",

His profile heading into college was basically \"Lebron is his daddy and is a plus athlete.\" \n\n\nIn any normal world where Lebron wasn't his daddy, he would have gone back for at LEAST one more year in college.

For some reason I figured maybe LeBron would take offense to that but you know obviously he's a professional so he knows what needs to be done. \n\nBut I think Bronny can get there, and people get hung up on the nepotism but really your odds of getting a better player at that pick were not going to be great anyway, lol.

His vision and awareness is fine for Summer League or G League, but a playoff team in the hunt post-AllStar break is basically the highest difficulty outside of the playoffs and the expectations are astronomical. Couple that it\u2019s *The Lakers* and half the games are nationally televised and that adds another level.\n\nHe\u2019s handled all that part decently since January and he\u2019s making the most of his garbage time minutes and GLeague minutes. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t really look like he\u2019s \u201c2 years away from being 2 years away\u201d. He does look like he\u2019s 2 years away though. I expect he\u2019ll play summer league and we\u2019ll get to see what he might have looked like had he went back to school and this was his first season. If he\u2019s putting up 15-5-5 in SL it\u2019s going to cause some over reactions. Because that\u2019s not going to translate unless he was the #1 option on the Las Vegas Tanks.\n\nBut it would show that even with a sophomore slump, he\u2019s probably going to be at the very least a decent role player type for a while. \n\nWhich is his most likely case. A modern version of maybe Derek Fisher. \n\nNow Derek obviously seems vaulted because of his 5 NBA Championships. But he also has a career stat line of 8 points, 2 rebounds, and 3 assists.\n\nI think with space-and-pace plus non-triangle offenses it would look like 10-5-5 but he wouldn\u2019t get starter minutes either just because of size.\n\nNot-worse-case but  bad case is that he\u2019s just essentially a true 15th man. A guy that is going to be too good for the GLeague in his  mid 20s but not good enough to play more than garbage time minutes. \n\nIf his heart isn\u2019t beating for the game, he probably retires after a second contract and doesn\u2019t bother bouncing around the league. Maybe becomes a player development guy, scout, agent, or assistant coach.",
