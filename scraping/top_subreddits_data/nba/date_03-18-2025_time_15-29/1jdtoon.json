He had his niece and a couple other family with him and they spent the next 10 minutes chatting with us until the bus came, mostly about the Knicks, and unprovoked he starts telling us about his accident and the toll it took. He  emphatically told my wife and I to enjoy single every day we have, and to cherish each other because life is incredible and you never know when everything can change. \n\nWe got on the bus, the driver turns the lights off, and Tracy starts loudly singing the gambler by Kenny Rogers until the whole bus is signing together. We get off the bus at the hotel, he daps me up and tells us to have a great trip. \n\nJust an incredible interaction and I\u2019ll never forget it.",

It looks like coffee grounds. That's when it's really really bad, like call 911 ambulance bad, cause you may have serious internal bleeding that has been accumulating in your stomach.  If it's bright red, it means it is fresh and obviously still urgent but potentially more something acute -- like a cut in your throat that bled into your tummy and you threw up.  It's happened enough to me now that I have varying levels of freak out depending on the color and how long I was feeling nauseous before vomiting haha.  I have a whole host of stomach issues, hence the experience in this.  Gatsroparesis being the primary issue.  If I throw up normal but then 30 minutes later throw up some red blood I kinda assume I just opened up a cut in my esophagus on a previous hurl and it is what it is, don't really do anything about it but monitor.  But if I feel sick for hours on end and then throw up a bunch of black vomit, I am rushing to the ER cause I may be at risk of actually dying cause of some internal bleeding in my stomach",

Once there, you should probably release, as there would be some buildup. You can then alternate between pinching and opening your nostrils, letting blood build up then releasing.

Not just because swallowing blood makes you nauseous, but because it's good to know how much blood you've lost / are losing. Blood in your stomach is just as lost as blood on the floor (yeah nutrient recovery  whatever) You can more easily tell when you're getting to \"find a doctor\" levels of bleeding\n\nDuring all this, you should also be pinching the ?bridge? of your nose, as the thin layer of skin on bone makes it easy to cut of *some bloodflow to the area, without being very painful or uncomfortable.",
