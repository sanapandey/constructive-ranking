At the end of the day they're all intrinsically violent sports. I do think a lot of people underestimate how much basketball is a contact sport though.

You can't just arbitrarily say that it's non-basketball physicality related when it occurred during a basketball game between basketball players who were beefing.\n\nBut there were a variety of serious issues due to the physicality:\n\n\\-Low scoring 75-70 type games in the 90s-early 00s were not fun to watch;\n\n\\-Over-emphasis on lower skilled bigs who could throw their weight around decreased floor spacing and took the sport into a slow, one-on-one style of play that was just not good for the game;\n\n\\-Karl Malone giving Zeke 40 stitches on purpose was about as ugly an in-the-flow of action play as you'll see;\n\n\\-The Malice in the Palace was obviously a major issue, which led to all the changes in rules that have come since;\n\n\\-If you go back into the 70s, there were many more ugly fights involving guys like Al Attles, Jerry Sloane, Kareem-Kent Benson, and others.",

The Rudy fight did not happen because they allowed more physical play, that is so incredibly disingenuous to try to say that. A fight broke out. If physicality was an issue back then you wouldn't see scattered examples but fights every game with fists being thrown. Hockey and football seem to be doing just fine. And ya football and hockey by nature are more aggressive sports but basketball wasn't dying because guys were allowed to play with more contact.\n\nWhat the hell does the Malice in The Palace have to do with anything? A fan threw a drink at a disgruntled, hot headed player in Ron Artest. Nice try on trying to insert something irrelevant.\n\nBasketball was just as physical in the 60s yet they had plenty of highs scoring games. More physical games does not mean lower scoring, especially with the prevalence of the three point shot now, that just wouldn't happen. What would happen is guys like SGA, Brunson, Embiid wouldn't slow the game down with the constant whistles.",
