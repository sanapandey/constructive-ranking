Several years later he said it wasn't because of D Will and the team traded him a week after Sloan retired anyways, the FO would have told Sloan to hang on for a few more days if he approached them with retirement with the solution to the problem so close on the horizon. I'm sure D Will's attitude was a factor but it wasn't the sole cause of the retirement and he wasn't as big of a locker room problem as someone like Raja Bell had been a few years earlier.  He rode out Mark Jackson trying to stage a coup against Stockton, Adrian Dantley throwing a tantrum that Karl Malone was better than himself and I'm sure there were a hundred other locker room tiffs that didn't make him budge over the decades.",

A lot of times, the book will offer you a lower payout based on updated odds during a game. For instance, if you bet $5 on 2 teams to both win with a potential payout of $13, and midway through the 3rd quarter, both teams are winning, the book may offer you a cash out of like $6 to basically convince you to take less because they think they will lose the bet. Or if both teams are losing, they might offer you like $1 to avoid the chance of the teams coming back. So cashing out is not the same as a withdrawal.",
