It takes a lot of time to heal, a lot longer mentally than physically. But still, despite all that i have faith that people can do better, even if many of them never change their ways. I am a fan of Hayes' game, but not really a fan of him as a person, because of what he did. But i still would like to think, that him going to counseling and community service would have done good for him, and that now when he's older, he has understood, that being a domestic abuser is a shitty thing to be. I suppose he has done the things he was sentenced to do, i think he would have been arrested if he didn't do the cs and counseling, right? The person who deserves the apology is the one who was abused. I don't understand why he should apologize publicly, since doing that after such a long time would be probably seen only as a publicity stunt and cleaning his image and he would get shit for that. Only if his ex asked some kind of public statement i would be fucking annoyed if he didn't do it, otherwise I don't understand what's the point. It doesn't change what happened. Only thing he can change is the future, and I sure hope he doesn't do any of that shit again.",

First game Zubac was feasting when up against him, he just gets bodied to the point he can't even contest. Second game, they instead played the passing lane to Zubac and denied the ball. Other than that, he plays as a roamer/helper shot blocker on defense.\n\nWhile Rui or Bron throws their body at the 5 (if they are healthy of course). DFS and even Vincent sometimes does it but that's not really the same, they play aggressive to deny the ball rather than try to hang with the 5. They still badly need a 5 that can body people.\n\nHe has been ramping up on the offense though. Dude is feasting just running to the rim, and now gaining confidence and doing play like this. Or against Sun, I saw the guy drive to the basket.",
