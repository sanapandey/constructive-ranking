We see PG completely fallen off and JB is a tier above him for sure, but sometimes, that shit is quick. He\u2019s had so many injuries and his timeline matches perfectly with Steph\u2019s so it makes more sense for them. Didn\u2019t hate the trade, but damn we do blow. Too many one dimensional guys I think and not enough top tier talent. I think, given some improvement from Tyler and what some expected from either Rozier or from development of young guys, some Heat fans, myself included, thought perhaps we could remain competitive with better talented teams as we had been. I don\u2019t blame Jimmy for wanting out. I think he mentally checked out when we didn\u2019t get Lillard, but last season just was draining and the Terry pickup blew up in our faces hard. Oh well. I say blow it all up and rebuild with crazy picks like OKC or the Nets.",

Miami made 2 Finals with Jimmy before failing to improve their roster multiple off-seasons in a row, and then instead of honoring a trade request (which IMO made perfect sense for Miami to re-tool), they played hard ball and Butler called their bluff\u2014lowering his stock.\n\nMoving on from him has turned out poorly every time it\u2019s happened.",
