Magazine with their father. \n\nTheir Father Talks Near-Death Health Scare in First Interview Since Amputation:\n\n\u201cI had an infection on my foot that started spreading through my blood due to not paying attention to my diabetes. I ended up having to get my leg amputated. First, they cut off a couple of toes. Then they cut off my foot. Then they said, We gotta go almost knee high for another surgery. Three surgeries. And then there were also the blood transfusions. Not one, not two, not three, four different times.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zdyT1-Q61GA",
