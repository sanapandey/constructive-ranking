                                    "body": "> It really is simple. Detroit will draft him [at 42] with the intention to have him on a two-way contract, Lakers called him and guaranteed him a two-way spot if he gets undrafted. Now, put yourself on his shoes that time, would you want to be at Detroit or Los Angeles on same two-way contract? It's a no brainer. The only advantage if he chooses Detroit is to hear his name get drafted. And he clearly said on this interview, he doesn't care hearing his name out there since it's the tail end of the 2nd round.\n\nPlus Detroit rotation was younger and deeper than the Lakers roster, so his agent was likely to have figured on him getting more playing time with LAL",

But the 2nd hand embarrassment was too much to bear. The point you ATTEMPTED to make isn't even true LOL. Sit Down kid. Reeves is NOT the first rookie to have a triple double his first season. Plenty of rookies has had tiple doubles, even in their first game. Reeves is the first undrafted rookie to record a triple double while scoring 30 points.. Theres a reason why even the self-proclaimed most confident player in theleague, James Harden shoutsout russ for helping him develop the mindset and his confidence in the game. You can even take a look back 3 years ago, thugh ar15 might of gotten a triple double in his first season, he was  a shell of a player vs what he is these last 3 years. The day he became the player we know today is when he played against dallas and hit that game winner from kick from russ. And since you're talking, Id assume youa ctually watch those games, you can see every dead ball, every time out Russ was in his ears. Historically speaking, strictly on papers. any player Russ puts under his wing, from harden, hachimura, pg13, cam payne, Monk, zubac to beal jumps a whole ass pay grade. Beal even often talks about the impact of Russ the first day he went to washington during a scrimmage and how he built his confidence. PG13 LITERALLY played the best basketball of his life in OKC, career high all stats, only time he led league in steals,only time he made 1st team, 2nd time he made all def 1st team, finsihed highest at 3rd for both MVP and DPOY voting. Though he recovered 100% from his gruesome injury, he often noted that it wasnt a physical problem but a mental problem with his confidence. And that those years with Russ helped him build it back up.  Even now with Braun though he had some good minutes in the last few years, hes having his best year this season",

Couldn't really do everything great, but just average that showed a ton of heart and motivation. \n\nThen he developed his ball-handling, increased his 3pt shot-making, became better at passing, and his overall vision of the court was improving. \n\nRight now he's an high iq, elite offensive player that specializes in play-making, shot-creation, and rim-slashing with great handles. His weaknesses are obviously defense but he holds his own against equally sized players that aren't very quick.",

Obviously he survived some bad coaching from Ham, but LeBron is one of the best vets to learn from which would help mitigate that, Detroit didn't have anyone even in the same galaxy as far as veteran leadership went before this year (Cade was still probably too young himself to really take up that role). It's still a fun pair to imagine, maybe one day at the Olympics or FIBA.",
