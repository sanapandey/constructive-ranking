This season LaVine is shooting 44% on 7 attempts per game, and across the previous 5 seasons he averaged 39% (832/2149) on 7.5 attempts.\n\nLaVine is one of the league's elite 3 point shooters, both off the dribble and from catch and shoot opportunities, and he averaged 39% on high volume as far back as his 2nd year in the league. Gordon's value comes from his diverse skill set; he's a far better rebounder and a dominant defender at 3-4 positions, but LaVine's shooting and shot creation are on an entirely different level, and have been for his entire career.",

And that's kind of the problem and also why Denver's defense works.\n\nOur player development staff deserves immense credit for salvaging decent/good spacing talent from scraps in Santos and Post, because otherwise this team's spacing would legitimately rival some of the worst in this league. But our spacing can be pretty bad with the right gameplan.\n\nKuminga and Butler in theory gives us workable rim pressure but the idea that those 2 can close playoff games with Draymond as well is a dice roll we haven't had to worry since the end of the 2019 Finals. At this point it looks inevitable, but this is not the first time our spacing not look pretty nor will it be the last.\n\nI don't deny the trade worked of course, but still.",

You don't have enough rim pressure to give yourself easy outs with the lack of collective shooting. \n\nI think the biggest thing is when you actually play a top ten defense, in the Regular Season to see what it actually looks like. I think there are still some deep offensive challenges that have been masked by opponents who have poor defenses (e.g Knicks). \n\nBut as I said, you could easily draw Houston. I would take you in that series in six, but man it could get really ugly in that series with Thompson, Jabari Jr, Brooks and Eason.\n\nBut the trade was absolutely worth it and to be honest I think there is at least another year there if Steph stays healthy.",

I personally don't care a bit if Jokic ever wins another MVP. SGA is absolutely deserving. Jokic hasn't lost a single MVP to fatigue, Embiid had a better season, and if SGA wins it won't be about fatigue either.\n\nUnless Denver closes the win gap SGA is probably going to win.

If MPJ made even one of those mistakes Malone would\u2019ve taken him out.\nBut rocking with Spencer Jones, very good energy for his debut and grabbed some important rebounds, and good defensive stops. A few mistakes but he should be put in the bench lineup",
