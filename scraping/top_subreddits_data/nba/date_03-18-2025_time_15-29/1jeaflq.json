Like, that\u2019s just not our team.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers, Redick felt, had a bit of a geometry problem.\n\nFor as great as LeBron James and Anthony Davis were, and for as much defensive attention they commanded, it wasn\u2019t enough to consistently break defenses and generate the caliber of high-percentage open 3-pointers that the league\u2019s best teams like Boston and Cleveland do.\n\nAnd then the Lakers acquired Don\u010di\u0107.\n\n  \nHis arrival has changed the geometry of LA\u2019s offense. The Lakers have actualized Redick\u2019s preseason vision of becoming a high 3-point volume team, one of the primary offensive principles in the modern era.\n\nThe Lakers are attempting 42.3 3-point attempts per 100 possessions since Don\u010di\u0107 made his debut on Feb. 10, the second-highest mark in the NBA over that stretch. Before that date, the Lakers averaged 34.3 3-point attempts per 100 possessions, which ranked 26th in the league. With Don\u010di\u0107 on the floor, the Lakers\u2019 3-point frequency increases by 6 percent, a mark that ranks in the 94th percentile league-wide, according to Cleaning The Glass.\n\nDon\u010di\u0107 is a threat to pull up or step back for 3s at anywhere within 30 feet, putting defenses on edge as they try to take that away while preventing him from shredding them with his generational court vision and playmaking.\n\n\u201cHe creates such havoc for teams\u2019 defenses that 90 percent of the time people are blitzing him, as you can probably see, and he makes the right play out of the blitz,\u201d Austin Reaves said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t try to force it too much in those situations, and he makes the right play. So therefore you\u2019re playing four-on-three, and it just comes down to playing the game the right way and passing it to the open person, because three people can\u2019t guard four.\u201d\n\n",

He's too tall and can see over defenders, understands how the defense is moving and what it's allowing him to do, so he is always able to find the open player.\n\nBoston did it best. They essentially assigned a player to guard Luka 1 on 1, let him work his tail off on offense and settle for him scoring 30 per game while the role players are covered and aren't allowed to score themselves. But there aren't many players in the league who can guard him 1 on 1, specially now that he's getting his legs back and is moving faster seemingly each game.

I won't speak for everyone because there are drama goblins in every basement, but people aren't mad at Celtic's style of basketball. You launch an absurd amount of 3s, but it's done ethically. There's ball movement, player rotation, finding the open man and actual scheming.\n\nWhen people whine about the current 3p meta they are talking about all the middle of the road or garbage teams jacking up bad shots and just launching 3s that aren't good looks.  It's the Lamelo stepbacks, it's the jazz, hornets and wizards being in the top 10 in 3PA but doing it at a bad percentage that irks people.\n\nEdit: Removed Bulls, they're actually shooting a good 36.3% on the 2nd most attempts in the game, sorry. Wasn't aware of your game.",
