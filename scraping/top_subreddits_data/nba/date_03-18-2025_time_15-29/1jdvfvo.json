You obviously already know this as a Pacers fan, but his offense was supposed to be the project when he was drafted - he seemed like a sure shot to come into the league being able to guard 1-4. This might be because I don\u2019t rly watch college basketball, but I find it difficult to believe the difference in scheme complexity between the #1 college team in the country (when he was drafted) and the average NBA team is so vast that a great defensive talent with excellent instincts still looks completely lost in his third year? He seems like the most obvious candidate for needing a change of scenery to take a leap",

When he doesn't over do the risky reach ins he stays in front of superstars and gives them a tough tough time. He's huge, quick and has fast hands. But yeah i don't watch college ball i just know what it looks like when he rotates and closes out on the same guy as someone else on our team leaving someone open. It happens OFTEN. And his offense is actually decent he just makes risky choices a lot on a team that doesn't need to do that.",
