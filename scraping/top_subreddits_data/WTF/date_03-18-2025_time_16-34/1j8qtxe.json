This type of stuff was everywhere. It was used in marketing. Which doesn't really do much but show how recent and how common openly racist shit was around. It was in Loony Tunes cartoons. Look up the Disney movie Song of the South. Look up Peter Pan and how it depicted Native Americans. \n\nGo into any antique mall in America and you'll find piles of this stuff. It wasn't rare.

The deed on my parent's house mentioned a number of slaves that were part of the \"property\". Because it was an old house - by US standards. Our civil rights movement wasn't really that long ago. Just a generation or so back.\n\nMy point is that it's not shocking to find out that people from our grand parents generation did a lot of racist shit. My grandmother called black people \"colored\" because that's just the language they grew up with.\n\nNow, sure, seeing photographic or historical proof of them being violent would be a shocker. But I don't think it would be something that really was particularly revealing. If grand dad was using dogs on protestors you probably grew up with an openly racist grandfather.\n\nMaybe that's the difference. This isn't secret, forgotten history for us. This is just how all our grandparents grew up. It's almost expected to find some crazy shit when you start looking through your family history. We just put the pictures back in the box and tell our friends about later at the bar. We don't celebrate it. We don't hide it. It just is.",
