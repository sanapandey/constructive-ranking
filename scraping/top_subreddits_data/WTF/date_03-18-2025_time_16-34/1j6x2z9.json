I block them out of restaurants.\n\nI was doing my thing one night, and the restaurant owner is on the phone, trying to get his fryer filter repaired. He told me he\u2019d been trying for weeks but the co was booked solid.\n\nI\u2019ve got a degree in engineering, so I said I\u2019d check it out. I managed to get it apart, and get a look inside.\n\nInside were two large dead rats, or what was left of them, bones and fluff mostly. They had got in the machine via the purge pipe, and got stuck inside.\n\nSo for probably a month or two, all the fried food from this establishment had been cooked in oil that had been filtered through two rotting rats... \"",

I pulled the starter cord and we heard a dirty crunching noise inside the motor. Opened it up to see what was wrong and found that a family of mice had made their home in the fan housing and were now very dead, all over the inside of the housing.\n\nMice die on industrial scales on farms. After harvesting grain, we would store the combine headers (the part on front that cuts the grain and feeds it into the machine) in the shed for the winter. The mice would build massive colonies in them to eat all the dust and grain leftover inside them. You\u2019d hear them squeaking all over inside and around the combine too. Anyway, when it was time to harvest again, you can probably guess how the mice got cleared out.\n\nDead reptiles is not something I ever saw on our farm though",
