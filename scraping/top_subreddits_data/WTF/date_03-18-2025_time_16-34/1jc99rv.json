Adult babies are usually frowned upon by the furry communities because of how weird they are.)\n\nAdult babies will FREQUENTLY pay their favorite furry artists for commissions all the time. There are actually whole entire communities and conventions dedicated to subcultures like this. There are hundreds of thousands, if not maybe even millions of furries and ABPs out there so it's not like this is an obscure thing.\n\nI 100% believe that this person is an adult baby who paid a furry artist to paint their room. Or who knows, maybe this person IS the furry artist that other people pay to paint their rooms!\n\nEither way, I don't think this was an amateur job at all. Somebody paid to have this painted by a professional who's in on the whole weird subculture thing. I say this because it's just so extremely common to get custom furry art that I think it is unlikely that this was just a spur of the moment DIY thing.",

Are you serious?\n\nAdult baby doesn't just mean diapers. It means cartoon characters, \"infantilism\" like pajamas, PAINTING CARTOON CHARACTERS ON WALLS LIKE YOU'RE IN A NURSERY, and most importantly, scat and pee fetishes.\n\nHave you ever asked yourself WHY they wear diapers? It's not just to look trendy and cool. There's a reason why adult babies do what they do- 90% of the time it has to do with pee fetishes and 60% of the time there is poo/scat involved. and 10% of the time there's eating of that poo involved.\n\nNow go back to those pictures and look at the walls. Do those nursery-style cartoon rainbow unicorn paintings urinating on each other NOT resemble what a deranged adult baby would do??\n\nNot all adult babies are furries, and not all furries are adult babies. HOWEVER there is a HUGE overlap between the two in terms of subcultures. So therefore it's not that big of a stretch to say that maybe just maybe this bedroom belonged to an adult baby who may or may not have furry leaning tendencies.",
