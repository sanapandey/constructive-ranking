Odd...can't see anything wrong. Roll up to the next intersection and the light shines on...exactly your picture.\n\nI got home, a little freaked. Took pictures and submitted to our public health dept. Amazingly, an investigator called me back in 12 hours, while driving to the McD's. The eventual story was that they fried the chicken for the wrong preset time? Who knows, that's their story. Nice to see my institutions in action though.",

She and some friends went for lunch, and she was served a raw lobster tail. When she complained, they told her that was impossible because they use presets, so the lobster was fine. She pointed out the flesh was translucent. They said no one else ever complained. She held it up by the fins and said something to the effect of \"The shell is still *green*. This place is called *Red* Lobster. I don't expect fine dining, but at the very least, I expect the lobster to be red!\"\n\nSo she was asked to leave.\n\nAnd she would tell this story every time Red Lobster was mentioned for over thirty years.",

So to cook you have to make them warm enough and they should be good to go.\n\nEdit: thanks for the clarification its not an universal thing about being preboiled before freezing.",

Store closed at 2 or 3 AM depending on the day. Any leftover burgers that weren't sold were turned into the next day's chili meat. \n\nthey threw your chicken into the fryer and had no idea how long it was in there because they didn't use a timer.",

It starts off as the worst food poisoning you can imagine-vomiting every few minutes for 12-24 hours. I slept on the bathroom floor and could not physically get up for 36 hours. At 36 hours I crawled into bed so weak and delirious I couldn't call into work, nor did I care too. Sweating, fever dreams, delirium. At 5 days I could barely stand up and put my clothes on and some how drove to work fearing I would be fired. MY co-worker saw me and instantly said you need to go to the ER. My eyes and skin were yellow-jaundiced. I had red spots all over my feet and ankles.  At the ER they rushed me to ICU and told me to call my family, they were not sure how long I had. My body was shutting down and I had thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or TTP, a rare blood disorder brought on my the salmonella poisoning. It causes tiny blood clots to form in the blood vessels, drops your platelet count drastically. In addition to that my kidneys and liver started shutting down.  At the time, early 2000's most doctors did not know what this disorder was or how to treat it. Luckily the hospital my insurance was associated with did. I had to have a a catheter placed in my chest and many blood and fresh frozen plasmas transfusions later my body started recovering and I pulled through. After a couple of weeks I was released. Took me a month before I was strong enough to do anything more than a few steps. \n\n TLDR: Salmonella can kill you and raw chicken is absolutely nothing to fuck with.",

Granted, if you're dehydrated or absolutely unable to keep fluids down, then doctors will treat you for that - but they won't do it prophylactically. Been there, tried that. \n\nGood luck!

Granted it's been almost two decades for me, but we used a fryer that you had to close and seal for it to cook. You couldn't open it until the timer was DONE. Even then you had to turn a crank to get it open. \n\nThe ONE time I saw my manager try to force it open before the timer was up, because a customer was complaining about chicken taking too long (we had just run out of cooked chicken in the drawer) I had to stop her. \n\n\n1. This thing will probably explode hot oil everywhere if you do that. \n\n2. Is it even worth the MAYBE one or two minutes lost of cook time to get it out the door and potentially kill someone?",
