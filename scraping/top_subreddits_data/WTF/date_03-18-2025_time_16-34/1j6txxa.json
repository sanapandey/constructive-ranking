Assuming he isn't contracted.\n\nOtherwise, I would imagine the contractor would take most of the heat, since they would obviously know this is going on. So, either they encourage it, or turn a blind eye to it.",

At least with civil matters.\n\nIn the case of criminal matters builders in developing countries are still sometimes held accountable for shoddy work. Especially if it generates a lot of public outrage. \n\nProbably a lot more than it's reported in the news here in the west. Our news doesn't care about such matters.\n\nOf course. This is all generally speaking. I have no doubt there are countries where said contractors are in the pockets of politicians or involved in some other shady dealings that keeps them safe. If such laws even exist there.\n\nHell, I've heard of shady dealings with American contractors that \"slipped through the cracks.\"",

In the construction contact they put a clausule where there is a threshold that needs to be reached or else there is financial compensation for the company. \n\nFor example: the developer builds a bridge on condition where ten million cars need to pass it annually. If that threshold is not going to be reached, that company is going to be compensated. \n\nIt's never going to be reached so the government is paying huge amounts of money every year to that company who in return gives Erdo\u011fan a cut. \n\nMany projects like this exist with the airport in bumfuck nowhere being the cherry of the cake.\n\nAdvanced corruption.",

Does the person in the video look to be following a trade method rather than just some schmoe doing mad stuff? If so, does that tradesman possibly know something my dumbass might not know?\n2. I can imagine a world before modern technologies. What did they do before the days of modern things like... reinforced rebar and the sort.\n\nFor example I was recently in DUMBO/Brooklyn in an office for a video game dev group called 'GUMBO'. The office is in an old building and while there I was just staring at the ceiling and everyone around me was like \"what do you keep looking at?\" And I would point at the way the ceiling (floor above) was held up and how interesting it was. You can see it in some of these pics:\n\n[https://gumbonyc.org/about](https://gumbonyc.org/about)\n\nAnd the work is very similar to what you just linked above. So yeah, spot on (of course, you're a structural engineer... you know more than me about this)!\n\nAnd sure, in the video the arch is less pronounced. But from the background it looks like a region that is more arid. These people have been probably building with mud/brick work for MUCH longer and they likely have refined their techniques more. I can see an arch, just much less pronounced... which considering this is likely how they have built there for ages (likely removing the steel supports and replacing with some older technology), they probably know what they're doing to optimize that arch. Where as that NYC structure was much more commodified/streamlined for a set of workers in a time period/region less used to working with the same materials on a master level (they were literally throwing up these buildings at mad speed in NYC... your labor force was while skilled was likely less so than some master brick layer from a region that ONLY has bricks).",

A little shear (like the walls moving up and down during the W wave in an earthquake, or back and forth like during the S wave), and the structural integrity of these bricks completely falls apart. You\u2019re unlikely to have a large heavy structure built using gravity arches to fail like that, so bridges and aqueducts that the Romans built are standing after thousands of years, but those have huge columns and multiple layers of bricks. If the building deforms even a little bit with these floors in place, they\u2019re going to collapse. If you have a heavy dresser or a piano or refrigerator, it\u2019s going to drop straight down into floor after floor.\n\nIf anyone wants to see what I mean, try this with some Lego bricks on your kitchen table. Just lightly connect them into arches and then wedge them between two walls or even 4. To simulate a quake, you can do three basic movements: slap then edge of the table once for a P wave, shake it back and forth for an S wave, and then repeatedly shake it up and down for a W wave. You\u2019ll see that the structure will be MORE stable with more weight on it for a P wave and maybe an S wave too, but the more weight you put on it, the less integrity it will have with the W wave. This is why the W (up and down) is often the most destructive.",

Usually you make a slight arch between the steel beam runs. The more arched those runs are the stronger it will be(or the closer the metal beam runs are), but even slightly curved but relatively flat looking arches will compress out to the beams very effectively. In Mexico it is standard and you will see it everywhere. Example of commonly used arch/flatness used in mexican building ceilings: [here](https://imgur.com/355Yuyk). And here is an example [of one of these types of roofs in the middle of building process](https://imgur.com/ighg0uC). You can see on this one that they often use a metal template to keep the arch uniform and standardized as they progress along the beams length.\n\nHowever you do usually have to put some amount of mortar/mix/flooring above to prevent degradation (plus concrete and/or waterproof paints if it will be acting as a top level flat roof),  as a protective layer above them as they should not be left out to the elements. \n\nIn this video the guy is not even putting mortar on the side of the bricks. The back ones they show halfway into the video like they were more correctly done(still too flat maybe), I'm guessing he didn't do those since these were made with the bricklines running in a different direction? The brick lines do short lines from beam to beam and seem to be ever so slightly curved.",

Arches transfer forces laterally and down. Domes can do the same, but in this case it is transferring all the downward force into tension on the steel. As long as the joints hold and the steel does not stretch, it is very strong. The terracotta is in compression so both materials are used in their optimum way. This is a subtle but important shift as a flat slab ends up seeing some tension and even the slight arch eliminates that (it has to be enough of an arch that it is robust and is always an arch at all points with the bottom of the bricks always in compression and never tension.) Likewise, the load on the steel is more complex, but the important force is tension from the dome. \n\nIn fact, this structure is so robust that he can do it by eye and sloppily and it will still stand. There is more to say about the history of the technique and how he will get mortar between the bricks when the top is finished, but I am reddited out for now.",

He may be a master but the only way to know is to see how many of his domes fail.\n\nBut even if done right there are problems:\n\n- Corrosion of joint fasteners will cause failure\n\n- Deformation due to settling or earthquakes will cause failure.\n\n- Any penetration of slab (retrofits, piping, etc) will weaken structure... and cause failure.\n\nThe main problem is that when it fails, it fails catastrophically. So it is not up Western standards but is typical for most construction around the world. \nIMHO",

As long as you construct the arch well, it shouldn't experience significant tensile stresses. Which should never happen, since brick doesn't take that shit well either. Yes, trapezoidal arch bricks exist, but that effect can just as easily be made with mortar.\n\nWhat's being constructed is basically a Prussian cap ceiling, or something similar to a Catalan vault. Used widely in the 19th and 20th century, and still stable.\n\nRegardless, the method of construction showcased could be better. While the structure does have a noticeable arch, I hope it doesn't have to bear too much additional weight.",

Will it\u2019s cheaper and back in the day having a concrete roof is almost impossible for Lack of building materials specially Iron rod and for it\u2019s high price \n\nNow after everything is available and for reasonable price ppl build their houses with concrete roof top and in my house I built the first floor like this one in the video we called it ( Akkad ) because it was the 90s and an in 2014 I built the second floor and it was concrete \n\nAnd all these years and weight and nothing ever happened. \n\nAnd there is a second reason ppl do it like this now days also because it\u2019s cheaper and sometimes when you are Building far from the city / village this can be easier and cheaper far more than concrete. \n\nI hope i send the message correctly with my bad English \u2026.",
