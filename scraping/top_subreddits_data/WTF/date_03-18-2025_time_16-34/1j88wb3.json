The bullet holes are grouped in a very specific way, and I also noticed notations from NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) and IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety). ",

A single car door offers NO protection against handgun rounds.\n\n2. Even two car doors and the passenger compartment offer little protection, and even that protection can be expected to evaporate when multiple rounds are fired.\n\nEdit: He also tested [rifles](https://www.theboxotruth.com/threads/the-buick-o-truth-4-rifles-and-car-doors.344/) and [shotguns](https://www.theboxotruth.com/threads/the-buick-o-truth-5-shotguns-and-car-doors.345/) on the car doors.",

Until some very smart person told them \"why not armor the places that come back without bullet holes, those seem like the ones that cause catastrophic failures since we never see them\". \n\nAnd thus an amazing discovery was made that day... No one in central planning had ever taken 5 seconds to look up what parts of a car are essential for continued operation.\n\nEdit : I'm obviously joking...",

Therefore, Wald proposed that the Navy reinforce areas where the returning aircraft were unscathed,[20]: 88  inferring that planes hit in those areas were the ones most likely to be lost. His work is considered seminal in the then nascent discipline of operational research.[24]",
