Sophia Urista, fitting name, is the urinator. \n\n*  In 2021, lead singer Sophia Urista urinated on a fan onstage during a\u00a0Welcome to Rockville\u00a0performance at\u00a0Daytona International Speedway\u00a0in\u00a0Daytona Beach, Florida. Brass Against apologized, tweeting that Urista had gotten \"carried away\". They added: \"That's not something the rest of us expected, and it's not something you'll see again at our shows.\" The band was banned from performing at the festival and future\u00a0NASCAR\u00a0events.\n\n[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass_Against)",

The opening band was a local group named Boom Unit Brass Band, and since Brass Against was focused on the rock side BUBB did an all hip hop set that was just \ud83d\udd25. They did an incredible medley of hip hop staple verses over an iconic sax beat whose name I'm forgetting right now. 9 incredible horn players and a great drummer\n\nBrass Against was cleaner in their playing but equivalent in energy. The new singer is fantastic, and their male lead has some PIPES in the upper octaves. My highlights were seeing Radiohead - The National Anthem, and Tool - The Pot performed.\n\n10/10 would go to my favorite venue again.",

But something about harming the body really makes an impression on people, and I am interested in how and why that happens.\n\n\nI'm also interested in self-injury as performance (like GG Allin and some of Marina Abramovic's early work) and what it means to the audience. (I don't know because I haven't done the research.)\n\n\n\nI haven't published on it because ironically, or maybe not, I had a huge breakdown in the midst of writing my dissertation and ended up not being well enough to actually seek a professorship. I got my PhD and teach (adjunct), but I am really focusing on therapy and getting better. (I found out I have C-PTSD, and it was incredibly debilitating.)\n\n\nI would still someday like to write a book exploring the idea, with at least some of the focus being for the education of medical professionals. There are too many that just don't understand, and some that are absolute assholes about it.\u00a0",

Sure, the instrumental will never be the same because overly distorted guitars will always sound heavier than a brass section, but the soul she put into her singing on those covers made up for it IMO. \n\nAnd also, this is not where they \"peaked\", but it may seem that way if you brushed them off immediately. They still make music today, they still tour, and still sell out arenas. They're doing just fine for a cover band.",

She has a hard ceiling and hit it years ago. \n\nDoesn't help when I Google it tried to auto finish from \"Brass Against\" to \"Brass Against pee\". It certainly wasn't trying to correct to \"Sophia's cover band is doing just fine\".  \n\nShe lacks the depth and soul for me, and that's that.
