It then rebounds him in a spin to hit the ground seemingly head first.\n\n\nObviously it's just debating hypotheticals and doesn't matter but I do actually wonder if hitting the net the way he did is preferable to him completely missing in this specific situation.",

Your day job is to fling yourself out of a cannon and you don't have proper health insurance?!?! I get it. Health insurance is a hot topic. It's expensive. We all should have it, but there are financial circumstances we find ourselves in where we don't. Still, this is somehow society's responsibility to pay for your \"stunts\"?\n\nThis is about as maddening as when I was at a random beard and mustache competition, and before the show started they rolled out a few guys in wheelchairs trying to raise money for \"extreme sports athletes with injuries\".\n\nAgain, if you are going to do crazy shit with a high degree of danger, death or dismemberment, take responsibility for it. Or, make sure someone pays you enough to engage in whatever it is you're doing so you can afford medical bills and your lifestyle later.",
