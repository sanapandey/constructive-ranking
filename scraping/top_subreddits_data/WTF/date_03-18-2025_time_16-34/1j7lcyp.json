They'd have to make one that could grow the organ first, then find a way to get it to discharge. \n\n\nSorry just even thinking through the steps is crazy. At best you could get one that electrocutes itself when it seizes up certain muscles that were converted to the organ. And even that would take like 20 generations with each step being huge. \n\nWhat they did with these mice is trivial compared, and it was not trivial or easy to make these mice.",

It\u2019s a key milestone in their mission to bring back the woolly mammoth by adapting Asian elephants, the mammoth\u2019s closest relatives, into a cold-resistant species. Though a striking success, experts note reviving mammoths remains a rather complex challenge.\n\nMore Info: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.03.641227v1",

I don't see why trees existing in the tundra would expedite those microbes, but the shade from trees would allow tundra to remain frozen longer.  \n\n> Elephants knock over trees, reducing bark that absorbs sunlight and heats the ground. Clearing a portion of the tree cover allows the animals to walk through new areas and pack down the snow there, facilitating permafrost freeze. Otherwise, the snow forms a fluffy, insulating layer that keeps the topsoil warm. \n\nWhatever heat bark is absorbing is negated by the shade put on the ground.  They aren't removing trees from the desert because they heat and dry the ground, they add trees because the shade creates net cooling, and more water retention.  Trees lowering ground temperature is a very well established fact and practice.  \n\nNow, there may be some net heating during the winter for trees without foliage.

We don't have massive cold and dry grasslands on Earth anymore. They quite literally don't have a natural habitat to return to. The only place where an engineered elephant-mammoth abomination could survive would be a zoo, and this is without mentioning that it would still only be a haphazardly engineered elephant.\n\nThe company working on this is genuinely upsetting me because it's a bunch of (admittedly talented yet still heavily misguided) geneticist hacks that seemingly misunderstand paleozoology and evolution trying to play god.

Machine learning is being leveraged for this, so we could theoretically feed in a bunch of genetic data and get a render of what an animal should look like. Think of it as DNA-to-organism, like text-to-speech, or text-to-video. \n\nThe crazy thing is once this problem is cracked, we should be able to do the reverse and feed in characteristics for an animal and get a bespoke genome for pokemon, unicorns, dragons, gremlins, xenomorphs, unstoppable flesh-eating bacteria, etc. You see where I'm going with this...",
