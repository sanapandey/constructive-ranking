                            "body": "That\u2019s somewhat safer, but still not a great idea. Less than lethal munitions such as rubber bullets are supposed to be fired directly at their target. I\u2019m not sure how water handles hits from LL specifically, but it\u2019s easy enough to skip regular rounds on water from specific angles. I\u2019m not sure where they\u2019re firing from in this exercise, but given the splash it seems to be from high up which is pretty safe at extreme enough angles. Well, about as safe as firing live ammunition at people can get, anyway.  \n\nWith LL ammo, it\u2019s specifically advised to not fire indirectly at a person due to their increased risk of ricochet, which given their material, can produce unpredictable changes in direction. Hitting someone in the head with one of those will absolutely kill them.\n\nAlso, a cool fact: Some LL ammo for shotguns is often shaped like a miniature nerf football!",
