The olfactory neurons in the upper part of the lining of the nasal cavity have axons that run through the bones of the skull and connect to extensions of the brain called the olfactory bulbs.

Infections can occur through this route though they tend to be rare. Some pharmaceutical companies are investigating this route for delivery of some medicines.",

And my friends and I all got mono from sharing joints with people.\n\nNot to mention the risk of COVID, RSV, or one of those animal flus that keep coming up.\n\nIt's a really disgusting habit when you think about it. Especially when you think about how when your lips are dry and they get that sticky white shit on them. Or people who never brush their teeth. Or have abscessed teeth.\n\nOr oral-herpes. Not just cold sores. But that's a risk, too if you've never had cold sores. Even if they're not broken out, it's still contagious for life. But, I think most people get cold sores already.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not trying to scaremonger or anything. But, as I said, few people think about there being ANY health risk to sharing weed. \n\nI just want to let you guys know there is A risk. However big that may be. I mean, I only got sick once out of 20 years, that I know of. \n\nI guess the risk depends if you're smoking with friends in high school, or if you're smoking with some skeezy fentanyl addicts who hang out in crack houses.",
