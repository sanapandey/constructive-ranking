The smell just assaulted me as I walked in and I don't think she spent more than a few seconds the hour that I was in there without a cigarette lit up. I remember thinking \"who buys orange carpet?\" when I walked in, but didn't think much of it. I took a look at the TV she was having problems with, moved the stand it was sitting on, and found out that the carpet was actually snow white. It was at that point that I looked at my boot covers and saw the tar caked to the sides of them. \n\nThe problem was a splitter with a loose connector under the carpet. The fitting and splitter were completely filled with tar. I had to re-terminate the connector and replace the splitter, which had me on my hands and knees for several minutes. I wore my tool belt in so I didn't have to put anything on the carpet. As it was, I was never able to get the stain or smell out of the knees of those jeans, and ended up throwing them away. The odd thing was, the house was tidy, organized, and at least appeared clean otherwise. Just everything had a layer of tar on it. \n\nI'd say the only other house that topped it was the one that had a utility closet with millions of spiders and egg sacks everywhere. That house I literally noped out of and told the customer they should be ashamed for not telling me before I walked in there, and that we wouldn't be sending any more techs until that room was addressed.",
