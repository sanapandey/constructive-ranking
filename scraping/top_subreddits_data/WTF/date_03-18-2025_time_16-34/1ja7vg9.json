Concentration goes down when you dilute things, so if you drop under the threshold, the thing is not considered harmful, and the problem is essentially solved.\n\nOf course that doesn\u2019t mean you should go polluting while making sure you\u2019re just under whatever the threshold is for environmental harm, but if an accident happens, you can know what the damage is or if there even really is any, at least.",

Lots of these chemicals we dump from labs have a long lifetime in the ecosystem. While a picomolar or a femtomolar concentration in the bay might not produce an effect we can measure, it might slightly reduce fertility rates among wildlife. \n\nThe real problem is that it just stacks up as we keep dumping. Sure, dilution helps because it'll take decades of industrial scale dumping of dilute waste in order to reach dangerous concentrations in our seas and rivers. But we've been doing exactly that for decades and it's starting to add up. If we keep going, we'll create such a toxic planet that there's no chance of recovery within human timescales.",
