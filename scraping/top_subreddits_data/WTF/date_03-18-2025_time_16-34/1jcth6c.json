Also the public has cars that are more expensive than medical equipment, and other people, electrical boxes and water pipes outside of buildings, children that may or may not be running around unsupervised, and all of this damage creates a giant list of liability because these things are not owned by one entity such as the things in a hospital. What are you on about acting like there\u2019s nothing to hurt in public. And if they send an EMT without any kind force equipped to him, what happens when a) dude just runs away (it\u2019s an open space bro, unlike the hospital) or b) he turns aggro against the emt and starts to fight. This is not such an easy solution. It is best to use all options in conjunction with each other effectively.",

When someone is having a crisis, calling the police is only going to escalate the situation the vast majority of the time. Police are not well trained to handle these situations in a non-violent and de-escalatory manner, and what results is usually cops waving guns around at a person who clearly is not going to respond well to threats and violence. This is how you end up with people who are simply having mental health issues being shot, killed, or arrested and charged with crimes.",

An overproduction of the serotonins and dopamine in the brain - just extreme misfiring too quickly. Brains don\u2019t get so excitable like that on rainy days. Drugs can make it happen probably every day, but often times, this has a mental illness component to the brain chemistry shift",
