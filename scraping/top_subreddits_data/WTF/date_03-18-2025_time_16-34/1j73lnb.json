You could actually make the lanes less wide or extend the curb out to the shoulders if this is residential, and start growing some trees. The perceived proximity of things to the left and right should slow people down. \n\nObviously painting lines on the road is the cheapest thing you can do. It looks like the lanes might have already been wider, or it was 4 lanes and they created the big shoulders to prevent people passing each other. It was probably a good first start",

The designers know nobody is going to slalom through a street like this, but it subconsciously makes drivers more cautious and makes most people drive a little slower. The same effects are found when narrowing lanes, placing objects such as trees or poles close to the road, building roads out of bumpier materials like bricks or stones, and creating busier road markings either along the edges of the road or sometimes across the entire road. Technically, none of these changes make a difference to the maximum safe speed of the road, but they demand the driver's attention and make streets safer for pedestrians.",

I was part of a 50 person company and frivolous lawsuits from awful people were a very real problem and rampant.  They have made documentaries about this problem like \"The Patent Scam\": https://www.thepatentscam.com/  Literally every tech startup has to deal with this fairly regularly (maybe one utterly frivolous lawsuit every 6 months or so).\n\nThis is really too common.  The issue is it is less expensive to pay these bad human beings than to fight it in court and win.  These terrible people know they don't really have any case, it's a shake-down/scam.\n\nI did the technical evaluation of one of these frivolous lawsuits where they were using a printer patent about feeding paper to the printer without jamming to claim our network product infringed because we didn't want our network packets to flood the network.  I was at first confused, then just kept laughing at how silly it was.  The \"networking\" code we used was utterly standard HTTPS, what you are using on reddit right now to read this.  We added nothing to it.  The concepts we were sued over are are underlying libraries and network concepts built over 50 years ago, and published for all to know, and literally every internet product or game you have ever played on the internet is using the same identical code, invalidating their patent anyway.  They must have known this was totally absurd and a shake-down.  We actually got that case dismissed very early \"with prejudice\" which means the courts realized it was frivolous and scolded them.  Some cases we won like that, others we paid off their scam fee to go away if it was below the court costs to win.  We dealt with this every 6 months or so for the 16 years I worked there!\n\nNot a single one of these lawsuits had any merit.  We never \"lost\" in court, but we employed lawyers to deal with it, and it used some of us technical people's time evaluating and supplying the lawyers with technical explanations of why they were all frivolous.\n\nI wasn't involved in this other thing at all, but my neighbor held a party in some shared space (shared between several apartment units).  I was invited.  He didn't serve alcohol, but paid for food for everybody.  A woman he knew well (like he knew everybody at the gathering obviously) showed up drunk, proceeded to drink more of her own alcohol there (which was allowed, other people brought their own alcohol and were drinking responsibly), her friends were telling her to slow down her drinking even because she was so sloppy drunk, she fell down a small flight of stairs (nobody pushed her, nobody else was involved, she was really drunk and stumbled) and was taken to the hospital by her friends with a broken leg.  So she sued my neighbor, which everybody said was flat out ridiculous and she lost the whole friend's group over it.  But his insurance paid her a few hundred thousand, because it was less expensive than going to court.\n\nBased on all that, I got an \"Umbrella Insurance Policy\" for my own peace of mind based on just seeing how random it can be.  Like this woman served herself alcohol, ate free food, tripped, and sued somebody else that wasn't involved other than inviting her to a nice party of friends.\n\nThis is really too common.  The issue is it is less expensive to pay these bad human beings than to fight it in court and win.  So these terrible people with no morals file frivolous lawsuits, and the \"system\" isn't good enough to get them all dismissed early enough in the legal process.  I have no idea how to \"fix it\", but the new American Dream is to basically fall down drunk and get free money for it so you don't have to work for a few years.\n\nOh, the reason it's so much better to do against a \"company\" is this situation has forced all companies even made up of 2 or 3 people to have liability insurance just for frivolous lawsuits.  If you sue a person (or small company) that doesn't have insurance it doesn't work as well because they probably would go bankrupt and be unable to pay.  But as the documentary \"The Patent Scam\" points out, there is a \"sweet spot\" of who you sue.  If you go after a gigantic corporation they have resources to fight the scammer.  The desperate little company, but large enough to have insurance, just wants the problem to go away for the least amount of money.  That's who you sue.  And the scammers know how much to ask for... maybe about half of what it would cost to defeat the scammer in court.",

I live in Austin and red light ticket cameras were outlawed for some reason, so people just blow through stop signs in residential areas where kids can be around.  What mechanism was left is speed humps to force everybody's speed down.\n\nAs long as people cannot defeat the speed humps, and are driving slower, I wish they would just have traffic cameras (and no speed humps).  That means a smoother ride, less acceleration and deceleration between the humps, less work on the car suspension.  Again, the city has \"defeated\" speeding (with the humps) so banning traffic cameras so you can drive double the speed limit through school zones won't work anymore like I assume was the intention of banning the cameras.  Might as well just drive slowly without all the roller coaster ride.",
