But realistically, my cars have suffered way more hits from car doors than rogue shopping carts over the years.  They are like Thanos - inevitable.  \n  \nProblem is, you lost on two counts.  \n1.  Nobody wants to be bitched at with unsolicited advice on how to live their lives.  You would have been much further ahead to just ask people to please put their carts in the corrals so they don't roll into cars in the parking lot.  You would likely get a better rate of compliance, and nobody feels put upon.  \n2.  I thought it was you who doubled-down by commenting on *how* the carts were arranged in the picture.  If unsolicited advice creates animosity, even more detailed unsolicited advice is only going to lead to a more negative response.\n\nSo, yeah, I understand your concern about cart collisions, but I'm not someone who leaves carts all over the lot either.  I'm also not someone who is going to criticize another person for where they leave their cart.  They have their reasons, and I have better things to do.

Organizing the chaos of randomly strewn carts into stacks works many lesser-used supporting muscles. Walking longer distances to retrieve individual carts boosts cardio fitness.. Taken together, no need for a gym membership. $ saved.\n\nI'm not saying that Costco employees who hate this shit are wrong. Just that there's almost always a silver lining, if we look hard enough while not letting ourselves be used as doormats.\n\nPersonally, if I were younger and I worked there, I would volunteer for cart duty every day. \n\n* Weight and cardio workout\n* Fresh air\n* Meeting people in good moods - those looking forward to shopping for great deals, and those grateful to get the hell out of there\n* Less exposure to the Costco Effect: People who've lost all situational awareness and higher brain function, shuffling through the warehouse like zombies, narrowly avoiding collisions, moaning \"Deals!\" instead of \"Brains!\"\n* Less chance of being assigned the depressing task of gathering and restocking items that Costco zombies leave everywhere after changing their minds about buying them\n\nI go off-topic, rant, and get weird because I care. \ud83d\ude04",
