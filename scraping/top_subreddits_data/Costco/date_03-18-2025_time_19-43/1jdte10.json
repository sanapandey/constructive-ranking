    "selftext": "Cat tax\n\nThese were on sale 19.99 @ Springfield Ma location, normally 24.99 I believe (maybe 23.99) I had to write a review here for these as I have found many of other people's very helpful, and this is the first product I've had from Costco (besides the discontinued lumpia, RIP) which made me go WOW\n\nI eat a lot of frozen seafood. I don't like fish but I absolutely whole hog go in for shellfish, and frozen is so accessible. I haven't done research yet on this company or fishing practices as I was so excited to have real Maryland style (the BEST, fight me!!!) for a smidge under 3.40 ea. For reference my local grocery store deli gets 3.99 ea and they're mostly breadcrumbs and small shreds. \n\nTheese Costco ones are delicious, mildly seasoned but not bland and with minimal breadcrumbs. It's actually very fragile, which is *exactly* how they're supposed to be. Tons of crab and so yummy. I will struggle to make these last. I resealed the inner plastic package in a ziploc and popped them back in the freezer. Extremely fresh tasting, like Id gotten it at a restaurant, despite being frozen. Another thing I like is they come in a protective shell - they can't easily be crushed even getting shoved around in the freezer. I briefly nuked mine to unfreeze the center then air fried it. I wish I had taken the time to pan sear it for that crust but I will in the future. I think I could air fry one if I had let it defrost but I was huuuungry\n\nAnother frame of reference, crab meat is tough to source inexpensively even in western mass. 6 oz of jumbo lump canned runs about 12-14$ per each, which is almost 70% of the cost of this Phillips brand from Costco already made. I could buy crab legs and get it that way, and they run about 11-18$/lb, so much of that is shell though, I bet I wouldn't get much more than the 6oz can if I did it that way although it's on my list of things to try at least once. I will say it's the best way to do lobster rolls though and I will never buy them out again unless being treated by someone else now that I know how easy it is to break down a lobster!!\n\nAnyways thanks Costco community hope this helps someone find a yummy dinner.",

They are mid at best but still find a spot in my freezer for a quick crab cake Benedict when craved. \n\nFor those who wanted to know what it was like since we didn\u2019t get a picture. Imagine a puck of breading and finely shredded crab meat (mostly breading), and on each cake 1 lump placed in the center. I\u2019d recommend making your own but I know not everyone has the time, resources, or know how to do that so these can be an alright alternative\u2026definitely not \u201cphenomenal\u201d",
