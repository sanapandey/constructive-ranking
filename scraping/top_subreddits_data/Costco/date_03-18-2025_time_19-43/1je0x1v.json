Do be warned, I've seen it go moldy once and THAT is not a pretty sight or smell.  (Bitter flavor is mold.)",

Open a jar up that's full of them and they come out as a giant cloud aimed straight for your face. It wasn't really obvious from the outside that the jar had molded, because the mold was on the inside face, not the stuff that was still adhered to the plastic jar.  And when a cloud of spores hits you right in the face, you can smell and taste them for hours. :-(",
