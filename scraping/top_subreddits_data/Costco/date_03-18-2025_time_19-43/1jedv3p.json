    "selftext": "Got the Casa Maria mortar & pestle from Costco but can\u2019t find too many solid review online. \n\nHas anyone bought this product - what are your impressions? \n\nI\u2019d like to use it for the usual dips, sauces and for grinding spices. I also want to make fresh traditional pesto, but not sure if granite stone is the best material for pesto. ",
