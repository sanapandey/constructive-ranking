    "selftext": "It is head and shoulders the best part of the warehouse. It might be the only department that continuously surprises me with something new and exciting. It's truly wonderful. \n\nIt's got an answer for everything I need. Thanksgiving? Pumpkin pie coming through like a champ. Not enough time to make a birthday cake? Always a variety of wonderfully decorated, differently flavored cakes. Cookie tray is perfect for making a meeting 5% less worse via sugar infusion. The new cornbread muffins? My youngest loves them so much when we ate them all she asked me why I hadn't gone back to buy more. Tuxedo cake has become such a family favorite at get-togethers that if I don't bring it people ask if I forgot to stop and pick one up. I used to work catering weddings, and any time the couple brought in Costco sheet cakes we knew it was going to be a good time, never failed. \n\nAnd the cake ladies! Any time I walk by they seem to be having a good time. Laughing, slingin' frosting, racing around on speed racks, I don't get how a group of people can seem to enjoy a job so much. (Sorry if you're a happy cake dude- maybe the warehouses I frequent are sexist and only hire women. I'm sure there has to be some of you out there, but I haven't seen them).\n\nI love it. I'm glad there's other stuff, but if there is ever an offshoot business that's just the bakery, you'll never see me at a regular warehouse again. \n\nExcept for the everything bagels. Get the damn caraway seeds off of them!",
