Basically Costco knows ahead of time what the union will accept. Or they are fairly sure they know. They then give everyone else that amount so they can say \u201clook we were already giving everyone else this amount, you don\u2019t need a union to negotiate for you.\u201d The only reason we get 3 bucks over 3 years is because of the union. They have no incentive to give us a pay raise without the threat of the union.",

Medical benefits would make more headlines if people realized how much they were. I can only go based on my experience. Like I said before it's about $7500 a year they pay for just my medical benefits. I briefly left Costco for another company and my benefits got worse, the company paid a smaller portion, and my out of pocket was roughly $550 a month where I pay $32 per paycheck with Costco. Imm'm not sure how that's insignificant? \n\nOh and the hourly doesn't include the bonuses. Granred it takes time to get those but when you do it's an extra $4500 per year at the low end of the scale. Some folks get like $6k twice a year. Not bad. \n\nHaving said that I still think the pay scale is incredibly skewed. When I started starting was $11 and top put was $24. Now it's $19 and $30.20. Used to be more than double and now it's 50% more. When GM pay continues to go up by double digit percentages every year. My current GM makes so much that he puts his entire paycheck into his retirement and lives on his bonuses and a portion of his stock options. Has for years.",

That's not what \"someone in the union\" means, though, since both you and she are presumably in the union. Even if joining is mandatory, you presumably have contact with the union, so you would also know someone in the union. Also, standard union contracts mean they have to represent you if you get fired also, and you can bump it up the chain to the national level if you need to.\n\n> In fact, management dislikes the union, understandably so.\n\nThis has no bearing. Manager also don't like it when unions keep them in line. This says nothing about whether or not the manager was justified in what they want to do.\n\n> My manager couldn't transfer the incompetent employee for fear of a lawsuit from the union\n\nThere's still more going on here than what you're telling me. \n\n1.
