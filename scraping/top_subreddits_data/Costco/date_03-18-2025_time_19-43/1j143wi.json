Product names mentioned in comments yields better subreddit comment search results since words from images don't always show up in searches.

Individual posts with stock questions will still be removed. Please include your approximate location or region information so others can help you as availability can greatly vary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Note: The map is from Costco.com. Costco still hasn\u2019t updated their regional map to include Maine yet, despite the Scarborough warehouse opening in November 2023.](https://preview.redd.it/b2bzyowop5gd1.png?width=998&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e2c5155d29f3720378c0e550bfef236b050a37c)\n\nIn the event that nobody has answered your availability question here, please contact your local warehouse (call and choose to speak to \"Administrative Staff\" from the phone tree) or Costco Customer Service. Please have the item number you're inquiring about ready for them.",

Used to get the 18 pack at costco and watched it as the price slowly went up to hit $32/crate. However I can't find them at any of my 3 local Costcos and was wondering what happened to them. I can't seem to find anything about the product being discontinued from fairlife's end and i don't recall seeing the asterisk of death on the price tag. Is there just a shortage or will Costco no longer be selling this variety?\n\nI know I can order them online (for now at least) but it's also like $7 more.",
