I wouldn't be surprised if they still don't.\n\nAnd seems to be the same with video games. Now i'm sure that they make most of their profits from consoles, not PC. Fine. But how difficult is it to port a game that is built on Unreal engine or something? Like really? Even if they were only going to sell a few hundred thousand copies (and they can absolutely do much better than that), is it not enough to pay a small dev team?",

Even games that are regarded as masterpieces or which i regard as masterpieces are either grapically outdated or perform unstable or bad. \nElden Ring for example, as much as i love the game, it does not run on a stable 60 frames on the PS5. And it isn't a great looker in terms of graphical fidelity. Sure the artstyle is great and beautiful, but the graphical fidelity itself is just ok, considering that it can't hold a stable 60 most of the times. \nAlso the Atlus games which i also adore, sufferes from something similar. Metaphor for example The artstyle and soundtrack is outstanding, but the graphical fidelity of the enviroment or objects is PS3 era. Every rounded shape also has very visible topology and edges. At least it holds the 60 frames. \n\nEither they look sub par or performe worse, sometimes both. \n\nAll that doesn't make the games bad, and i still enjoy many japanese games. But there is a very perceivable gap between most japanese studios and the rest if the gaming market. Especially Sony's Studios, which in my eyes produce the most polished games for years now.",

The Japanese government is literally upset at that game because they're using assets that are illegal and culturally insulting to use. They've done the equivalent of making a toy of a Japanese Cowboy posing with a gun in front of the burning and smoking Twin Towers on top of all the dumb crap in the game. There's also a bunch of Chinese architecture in the game. A lot of Japanese people are bitter over it.\n\nIt's crazy how bad their depiction of Japan is. It's like they did no real research. There's a bit of games set in Japan made by the west, but I've never seen this much backlash from Japanese people.\n\nI do wonder though, if they had character creation or two Japanese main characters, would there be this much backlash? People who hate the game already will say yes, but I dunno. Yasuke being depicted inauthentically isn't the game's only problem, but it's what got the game a lot of attention with the growing trend of inauthentic/pandering DEI in western games lately.
