There was probably an old GPU lying around, and a faster fix than burning a few hours of someone's time who was familiar with the PC rendering paths.\n\nIn my case it was a lot like yours - everyone used PC builds if at all possible, but we had top end PCs to boot.  I'd often have to run 2 or more copies of the game to work on social or multiplayer features, trying to use multiple dev kits for the console social/multiplayer was such a pain.\n\nPerformance on console was still great because it was fine-tuned for the hardware.  We released on PC but there are so many permutations of devices you can't really set a benchmark and say \"make sure this never drops below 30 fps\".  I end up playing our own game with the settings turned way down on PC because I can't stand hitching and framerate variability.",

The retail consoles can only play the games and don't have any facilities to do that stuff. The dev consoles also have more memory, bigger hard drives, etc.\n\nJust for reference, I think (back when I worked on PS3) EACH dev kit was like $20k plus expensive software licenses, and you could only get one by being an approved developer by Sony. You couldn't just buy on anywhere. It took months to get approval, and we had to run dedicated license servers just to be able to use the thing. We also had a couple dev kits that were rack mount and I think more in the $40k range. Not that they cost that much, but they want to make sure you're serious.",
