Only minor quibble is not being able to use just one sword permanently, only if you steal one. Sometimes I like a more classic swashbuckler look.",

Show not tell\n\nCyberpunk 2077 - the best city in gaming. If you like urban cityscapes then getting lost in Night City is really an amazing experience.\n\nBaldur's Gate 3/Divinity Original Sin 1/2 - Larian is the best at isometric open worlds. Whenever I play one of their games I can't help myself but uncovering the whole map. And I still miss things.\n\nFallout 4 - just plain fun. Best gunplay in a fallout game, settlement system gives a point to exploring. Don't tell the purists but 4 is my favourite Fallout, even though New Vegas and 3 were my introduction to the series.\n\nMorrowind - Questing system that encourages, nay, forces being aware of your surroundings. No quest markers so you have to keep an eye out for landmarks and listen to/remember directions.\n\nValheim - survival crafting perfection. The world is just one big mystery for you to uncover. In a similar vein, Enshrouded.\n\nNew World - Really well-crafted world for an MMO, gorgeous visuals, and one of my favourite gathering systems in gaming. I love running resource routes with a podcast playing.\n\nGuild Wars 2 - SO. MUCH. MAP COMPLETION. Open world jumping puzzles, lots of POIs to discover.

Like there are more interactable containers in any given room in fo4 compared to NV. \n\nFo4 just has more to explore. The thing you're talking about is feeling reward for exploration. Which is part of story building. I'll agree there's a lot more charm in NV in terms of dialogue, lore, exploration meant more npcs with interesting stories. Fo4 is pretty bland in terms of npc. \n\nIf you take both games, turn off hud and walked around I'd say fo4 has NV beat.",

Especially if you have HOTAS and VR headset. \n\nMinecraft. You never know where you exploration will take you. \n\nGhost of Tsushima. The land is truly stunning. \n\nRed Dead Redemption 1. Honestly it was a break though game in terms of how beautiful it was, and all the parts of the map that could be explored. RDR2 expanded even more on this, but I still favor 1 because it came first. \n\nDark Age of Camelot. The sheer size of the world and the feel you got from exploring it was amazing. Plus it was a game where finding a group was not just encourage, but necessary to play.

Tons of fun things to see and do. You could lose yourself for hours just sightseeing. The sense of discovery while walking around the map is very real.\n\nThe quest design might be lacking but as far as the exploration and world design goes, it\u2019s some of the best. The core gameplay is just Fallout 4 but more refined.\n\nSuper underrated game nowadays. Absolutely deserved the criticism when it launched though.",
