You might know what your end goal is, but you have no idea which direction takes you there, or what you have to do to achieve it\n\n  \nSome examples are: Subnautica, Terraria, Hollow Knight, Outer Wilds\n\n  \nMost open world games do not fit the criteria, because they usually make it very clear the direction you have to follow, even though you are not forced to go in that direction. Examples: TES skyrim, RDR, GTA, Witcher 3, LoZ BOTW and TotK, Cyberpunk",

The second one I haven't played but 10ish hours with a friend building a base area and not progressing the story really at all but I already know about the locals so that initial wtf moment of terror has already been experienced. Saw some clips of later in the game though and there's obviously some shit I still need to discover. I never did finish the first one either so I gotta get on it and get the whole story.",

It really worked for a good amount of time! I was kinda sad when they finally did get violent and I'm not sure if something changed in the development direction or it was a fluke but I thought that was revolutionary at the time. Still don't really think anyone has done something like that. Most gamers are conditioned to kill on sight and I thought my pacifists nature had discovered something others hadn't. \n\nI recently played sons of the forest a bit with a friend and told him of this experience, and didn't act aggressive towards the locals when they first approached. They didn't attack me for like 45 seconds, like 8 feet in front of me and posturing like they were trying to scare me away but not actually attacking. I was like \"see? I think I'm onto something right?\" To my friend over discord. Right after that I got clubbed to death lol. It's a fun thought and there's definitely something to it in their AI I feel, but peace was never an option.",

I'm pretty sure you can actually make it to the current final boss (Fader) without needing to fight any of the others, although you will be hard locked out of the content that Modor provides. Everything else can be accessible*\n\n*Provided you have a world seed that lets you sail into Ashlands with a longship. Ashlands requires a special ship to sail without damage which can only be made by defeating the queen. But on most seeds I've seen, there is land close enough that if you have good wind (or use Modor) you can plow through and make it to land before the ship breaks. Another strategy is to place workbenches on the spires and repair the ship, but you will be under constant attack and will need to maneuver the ship, so best done with 2 people. Otherwise, good luck lol.",

No quest markers, no huge arrows pointing you in the direction of a quest. In fact, you have to rely on NPC directions to get to your objectives or to find cities, forts, etc. Which I really liked.\n\nThe only thing which you might find difficult is, well, the game's difficulty. The game does not hold your hand at all.\n\nDuring the tutorial area you might swing at an enemy 5 times and only hit him twice. And that's if you're using a weapon you're at least semi decent with.\n\nBut that's ok, because it makes the game more realistic. You don't start the game as an overpowered god who can kill anything in one shot, you start as a normal guy who just got off a boat.\n\nThe game is pretty cheap this days and also doesn't take too much space, so I'd say give it a try if you think it fits what you're looking for. There's some mods which help with draw distance and some that improve graphics, if you're playing on PC and have a problem with those things.",

            "body": "Hello there! It may not be a 100% fit with what you're asking for, but V Rising is the first thing that came to mind. It has a fairly linear progression (roughly: find the next boss, kill it, and repeat), but you're not given a marker/quest as such and there's a lot of exploring a fairly large map to find where some resources are located. The game doesn't give you a lot of hints, I think that fits in what you are asking for.\n\nAnother game similar to Terraria is Starbound. Also I know of Core Keeper, but since I haven't played it I can't tell you if it fits what you're asking for.",

I was lucky enought to play it blind for about 90% of the experience and I haven't had this much fun in ages. There are zero instructions or directions, you just have to experiment with all your tools and figure the game out through actually playing the thing. It's an absolute blast.\n\nAlso, if you're keen on an open world game that doesn't follow the typical ubisoft/witcher-esque template and emphasises the journey more than the destination, Death Steanding is quite good time. It does show you where your final destinations are for each task, i mean your a delivery guy right, but the process of getting there is completely up to you and can at times be rather challenging. The overall 'puzzle' of the world is basically geared towards the player building efficient routes through that world by backtracking and unlocking new tools for navigation that both you and other players can make use of. It's a really zen and cozy time once you get into the rhythm of it.\n\nRDR 2 can also be a great open world experience if you're willing to turn of all the maps and navigation tools on the hud. It's super immersive and detailed, few games let you soak in it's world the way rdr does.",

There are multiple \"worlds\" that are open and you can do anything you want, mini quests, mining, fishing, events. I highly recommend. The devs are constantly coming out with new stuff too. For such an old game it is still going hard. The best part about it tho, is the game is 100% free. You can do and make everything without spending a dime.

The instruction book pages are in game items, and is written in a made up language, so trying to figure out the instruction book is literally part of the game. \n\nIf you like Tunic, I'd then recommend Animal Well, Fez, and Void Stranger.\n\nEnvironmental Station Alpha is kind of like that too, but it's a bit less polished so I'd only recommend that if you love all the above games.",
