It has supernatural elements on the screen, but a lot of the series is about the conflict between mystery and fantasy (or anti-mystery and anti-fantasy). Seen from a mystery perspective, Umineko is more of a \"fair\" mystery than Higurashi. \n\nBut, don't watch the anime. It's a rather bad adaptation.",
