Despite this, it's a thoroughly enjoyable entry into the series for fans seeking to explore medieval Japan.\n\n[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl) \\- [Jakub Paluszek](https://opencritic.com/critic/10596/jakub-paluszek) \\- [6/10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/assassins-creed-shadows-recenzja-gry-rutynowy-otwarty-swiat/z046f0)\n\n>I have experienced quite a few really cool moments while playing Assassin\u2019s Creed: Shadows, but after 40 hours of playtime all those moments are lost in time like tears in rain. This new Creed has some interesting ideas to shake up the formula, but none of them are good enough to make it count. All in all, any potential for greatness was squandered for yet another opportunity to make a very big game.\n\n[Game Rant](https://opencritic.com/outlet/60/game-rant) \\- [Matt Karoglou](https://opencritic.com/critic/10492/matt-karoglou) \\- [9/10](https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows is a spectacular return to form for the franchise, delivering one of the series' more tightly focused historical adventures. *Shadows* is both the most tightly-paced and consistently rewarding entry in the modern *Assassin's Creed* games, delivering a version of Ubisoft's open-world gameplay that regularly fires on all cylinders in terms of its visual spectacle, historical tourism, meaningful side activities, satisfying combat, and compelling plot that drives the player forward.\n\n[Eurogamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/114/eurogamer) \\- [Tom Phillips](https://opencritic.com/critic/752/tom-phillips) \\- [4/5](https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review)\n\n>Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Assassin's Creed Shadows honours the beauty of feudal Japan, even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of two protagonists. And yes, for longer-term Assassin's Creed fans, there are a couple of moments that will excite those with a wider knowledge of the lore. But in general, Shadows is more standalone than perhaps any other game in the franchise to date, its focus fully on Japan, and free of any continuing characters or modern day storylines. That said, there's definitely space left for the future - within Shadows itself through more stories, or perhaps in another game entirely. Before the end credits roll, each character's story is rounded out but also given a tease of what's next, too.\n\n[TheGamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/731/thegamer) \\- [George Foster](https://opencritic.com/critic/2113/george-foster) \\- [4/5](https://www.thegamer.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Despite some repetition and bloat that makes Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows\u2019 final stretch drag more than the rest of the game excites, its brave approach to exploration in a gorgeous world, heartfelt personal stories, and satisfying tweaks to the formula still make it stand as one of my favourite entries yet. While no one can say if Shadows will be the all-timer hit that both Ubisoft and the series need right now, I can at least say that it\u2019s more than worthy of your time.\n\n[Kotaku](https://opencritic.com/outlet/276/kotaku) \\- Zack Zwiezen - [Unscored](https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647)\n\n>*Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows* doesn\u2019t completely revolutionize the core of the franchise. You still climb towers, take out targets, sneak around places, and interact with real history. However, it does shake up everything around these cores. Now you might climb a tower during winter and see a whole different view than you did in summer. Now you can sneak in the shadows as a lithe assassin or kick down the door as a samurai tank. And it leads to one of the most dynamic, fun, and best-looking open-world games I\u2019ve played this generation, and one of the best *Assassin\u2019s Creed* titles in years.\n\n[Hardcore Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/23/hardcore-gamer) \\- [Kevin Dunsmore](https://opencritic.com/critic/892/kevin-dunsmore) \\- [3.5 / 5.0](https://hardcoregamer.com/review-assassins-creed-shadows/)\n\n>*Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows* had a lot of elements on paper that made it sound like it could be the best Assassin\u2019s Creed game in years. It was finally going to be set in the long-requested Japanese setting, classic era fans were getting a narrative-focused experience and a greater focus on stealth, and RPG-era fans were getting their vast open-world and activities. While *Shadows* does deliver on a lot of these aspects, it also falls short on nearly as many. Yaskue and Naoe are fantastic characters with stories worth witnessing from start to end, but their stories are told with some of the franchise\u2019s worst animations. The world is beautiful to explore, yet parkour remains an afterthought. Both combat and stealth are the most mechanically deep they\u2019ve ever been, yet are both hampered by RPG mechanics that dilute their effectiveness and make them unnecessarily tedious.\n\n[Rock, Paper, Shotgun](https://opencritic.com/outlet/270/rock-paper-shotgun) \\- [Unscored](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review)\n\n>A beautiful recreation of 16th century Japan is stained with the clumsy ink of an uninspiring revenge tale, but take your time sneaking through castles and visiting temples to get the most from an impressive open world.\n\n[PC Gamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/162/pc-gamer) \\- [Morgan Park](https://opencritic.com/critic/2285/morgan-park) \\- [80 / 100](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Come for the neck stabs and stay for the surprisingly great combat, Assassin's Creed Shadows is a stealth action buffet with a story to forget. I don't think Shadows is something to marathon. You could completely ignore the story, come back six months later, and still be up to speed (the heads gotta roll). I know I'll still be picking away at its 30+ castles later in 2025 and 2026, because I get the itch for a great stealth game every few months, and now I have a new one with a whole lot of stuff to do.\n\n[IGN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign) \\- [Jarrett Green](https://opencritic.com/critic/5288/jarrett-green) \\- [8 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-review)\n\n>Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage\u2019s return to the stealthy style that launched this series doesn\u2019t do everything right, but everything it does feels like it was done with purpose. This means a shorter game with a smaller map, fewer collectibles, smaller scope in combat, and a limited selection of gear to play with \u2013 all of which I found refreshing relative to the arguably bloated scale of 100-hour games like Odyssey and Valhalla. It also means an overly simplistic plot with mostly forgettable characters, but what the story lacks in depth it makes up for with its straightforward quest progression and fast pacing.\n\n[GamesRadar+](https://opencritic.com/outlet/91/gamesradar-) \\- [Andrew Brown](https://opencritic.com/critic/1519/andrew-brown) \\- [4/5](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Not every idea comes together neatly, and two phenomenal protagonists feel wasted on a lackluster story, but this is a titan in the same leagues as series staples Assassin's Creed 2 and Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag \u2013 and Ubisoft's best RPG to date.\n\n[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot) \\- [Jordan Ram\u00e9e](https://opencritic.com/critic/4760/jordan-ram-e) \\- [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>So much of Shadows' issues come from Yasuke's inclusion. Not because he's a badly written character or because he doesn't feel like he belongs, but because much of what makes an Assassin's Creed game an Assassin's Creed is stripped away to make his samurai fantasy work. Naoe's shinobi fantasy works far better, effortlessly sliding into the gameplay loop of hunting down mysterious targets, puzzling through the best way to reach them, cutting them down, and disappearing without a trace. Naoe and Yasuke's story could have used more unity, especially in giving the duo a shared purpose to drive the plotline and their character development forward. But at the very least, Naoe's gameplay is the best that the series has felt since the transition to a more action-RPG format--Assassin's Creed Shadows is an absolute blast to play.\n\n[VG247](https://opencritic.com/outlet/549/vg247) \\- [Dom Peppiatt](https://opencritic.com/critic/253/dom-peppiatt) \\- [5 / 5](https://www.vg247.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review)\n\n>I\u2019m actually at the point where I\u2019m enjoying finding little problems with the game, because - most of the time - I know that means there\u2019ll be something interesting on the other end of it. That is high praise for any work of art, but in a video game\u2026 it really feels like something special.\n\n[Tom's Guide](https://opencritic.com/outlet/851/toms-guide) \\- [Nikita Achanta](https://opencritic.com/critic/10843/nikita-achanta) \\- [4/5](https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/assassins-creed-shadows-review)\n\n>Assassin's Creed Shadows delivers on its promise of bringing back classic stealth mechanics while introducing new ones and combining the best of the older and RPG titles. The detailed open-world of feudal Japan feels full of life with compelling playable and non-playable characters, and different fighting tactics enrich the combat. But the game struggles to balance its two playable protagonists, and player choices are still inconsequential.

While the art and history teams deserve recognition for their efforts, it's all unfortunately wasted on a narrative that goes nowhere, is poorly explained, and has no satisfying resolutions.\n\n[New Game Network](https://opencritic.com/outlet/405/new-game-network) \\- [Alex Varankou](https://opencritic.com/critic/2669/alex-varankou) \\- [74/100](https://www.newgamenetwork.com/article/2851/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Another solid entry for the series, Assassin's Creed Shadows offers a wonderfully rendered natural world, though it's not as unique as it once could have been. The typical mix of stealth and action gameplay is still enjoyable and is now split between two protagonists, though switching between them can be cumbersome. Fans of the franchise should be satisfied, if not exactly impressed.\n\n[Cloud Dosage](https://opencritic.com/outlet/951/cloud-dosage) \\- [Jon Scarr](https://opencritic.com/critic/11148/jon-scarr) \\- [4.5/5](https://clouddosage.com/assassins-creed-shadows-game-review/)\n\n>Whether Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is the best entry in the series depends on what you enjoy. If you enjoy tactical stealth, the game delivers. If you\u2019re more into a challenging combat experience, Yasuke\u2019s overwhelming strength may leave you wanting more.\n\n[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis) \\- [Adrian Burrows](https://opencritic.com/critic/4856/adrian-burrows) \\- [9 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review/)\n\n>Fans of Assassin's Creed have waited an era or two for a series entry that lets you be a ninja and explore Feudal Japan. Thankfully, the wait has been absolutely worth it. Assassin's Creed Shadows is an astonishing achievement. Vast, impossibly detailed, immaculately researched, and enormously fun, Shadows is easily one of the best games in this storied franchise.\n\n[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square) \\- [Robert Ramsey](https://opencritic.com/critic/932/robert-ramsey) \\- [8 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/assassins-creed-shadows)\n\n>While Assassin's Creed Shadows is unlikely to win over those who struggled to push through Odyssey or Valhalla, this is still one of the strongest overall entries in the series - and arguably the best of the open world RPG bunch. The storytelling is largely fantastic, the main characters are deeply likeable, and the open world itself is a thing of beauty.",

                                            "body": "Odyssey was just so much more mechanically sound than Valhalla imo. The combat was so satisfying, the looting and gear system while maybe a *teensy* bit excessive was fun as hell to mess around with, the exploration and the world were super engaging, and everything just felt so intentional.\n\nI had so many experiences in that game where I set sail to go do a main quest, only to find myself side tracked on some random ass little island, just to end up spending the next two or three hours of playtime wrapped up in some big ass multi part side quest line which was so completely intertwined with the main story that by the time it was over I looked at my journal and scratched my head because I had completely forgotten it wasn\u2019t a main quest in the first place. It made sailing around the seas sooooo much fun, and every new area was just exciting to get to for the first time.\n\nI think more than any other game I have ever played, Odyssey is hurt *a lot* if you just rush the story and ignore everything else. Because there\u2019s just so much *there* there outside of the main quests that if you don\u2019t experience it everything may feel a little shallow. It\u2019s genuinely one of my favorite RPG\u2019S (favorite game\u2019s period, really) ever.\n\nValhalla just stripped back 80% of what made Odyssey so special to me and replaced it with a giant repetitive slog that lasts *waaaaaaay* too long. So many mechanics and design choices were just completely stripped out of that game and what we were left with felt completely soulless. The first ten or twenty hours are fun, before you realize that the gameplay loop isn\u2019t going to really change at all in any meaningful way, and you still have 50 hours to go. It\u2019s just such a frustrating step backwards. Plus, the world is just so painfully *dull* in comparison to Odyssey\u2019s, which really did feel like you were stepping back in time into this giant and expansive world that was littered with secrets, stories, and god damn *character.*",

Not a great start to things\n- Tracking down my mysterious origins and finding out some exciting and very plot relevant precursor shit that was still totally optional \n- Having another island sabbatical on Crete where I tried to go the _right way_ about helping the locals (also steering clear of any romance), without any devastating fuckups or heartbreaking revelations.

But any time you want to select a new decoration for example you have to do it in a seperate screen. It isn't as good as a bethesda builder but it isn't bad. I think if you like to take the time in games to decorate, I think you'll like the hideout feature. It takes a lot of grinding to unlock all the cosmetics for the hidout though.",

It was great to take on a load of people simultaneously and pull off slick moves with ease. I also really liked the way the side quests worked where you could just systematically go through them. Once discovered, they were marked on the map so I knew where I had to go (I don't like running around aimlessly). I had a lot of fun with it and some of the open world oddities were hilarious. Such a fun time. Plus I loved Captain Kenway. \n\nAny suggestions would be super welcome!",

But if you approach it expecting the gameplay of Odyssey, you\u2019ll be disappointed. I think there is a lot to love in this game, especially for AC fans looking for a return to a more slow and methodical approach to stealth. But I remain concerned that by splitting the main character into two, neither of the characters feel properly capable.\"",

I will say Yasuke does kind of feel pointless in the game. They do give him a story but he can\u2019t accomplish everything previous AC protagonists could.\n\nThe core elements of AC games in my opinion are:\nExploration/Parkour + Stealth + Combat. Yasuke CAN\u2019T do Stealth at all outside of very specific builds that involve stealth archery (which they limit the amount of silent arrows you can carry significantly). His Parkour is very lackluster as well, because he CAN\u2019T reach the top of the famous viewpoints. And Combat is what he does, but then again, Combat in this game is not as good as Ghost of Tsushima, Souls games or Sekiro, so you do get bored of it at some point.\n\nWhat happens is you explore the world and play stealth as Naoe, and on occasion you play as Yasuke for a specific quest. But then once you leave you go around the world, you find Yasuke\u2019s limitations, which then prompts you to go back to the menu, choose Naoe, and load back to game. Just completely KILLS the gameplay flow.",

Unfortunately for Ubisoft, we just got KCD2, Split Fiction, and even Avowed. Next we have Clair Obscur, Doom, Mafia and GTA VI. This might get crushed between those just due to comparisons alone. I am certain that someone is recording the video \"KCD 2 vs Shadows\" right this second.",

It's what children do whenever someone disagrees with their opinion.\n\nObjective concern with the influence of money on reviews would start with looking at how outlets deviate for specific publishers compared to other outlets that don't run ads. Not simply hating a game you never played because right wing media told you to, and declaring people liars and frauds when they give it an average review in line with most other reviewers and prior titles in the series.",

You're not accusing good and bad reviews of being bribed and invalid, you're only accusing reviews for a specific game you want to hate when you disagree with the reviews. You can't pick and choose without being obviously inconsistent.\n\nAlso saying it's a paid review is literally untrue. When you aren't being paid for doing the review but for a separate service regardless of whether there is a review, then you aren't being paid for the review. Sorry not sorry, but that's how the English language works.\n\n>This is not an objective review in any shape of the word,\n\nSure, no reviews are objective.
