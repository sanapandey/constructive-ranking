I can understand Hollywood cigar comping executives green lighting that after seeing some test footage.\n\nWho the fuck green lit this? It just looks so horrible? Who the hell is the target Audience for this film? Like for the kids? Then what's massive Mamoa and Jack beer belly Black doing in it? For the adult fans? Then why is the comedy so slapstick stupid? \n\nI don't have kids so I guess I don't know fully but I can't even imagine a 12 year old Minecraft freak of a kid looking at that trailer and wanting to go see this film. \n\nAnyone with kids have one that wants to see this? I don't think I've been this confused about a movies direction in a looong time",
