And there's a shitload of walking.\n\nMay also want to check out ready or not if you want something more tactical & close quarters. And if you aren't opposed to older games: SOCOM, operation flashpoint, and the rainbow six series.\n\nAnd outside of milsim, i'd also recommend time splitters, the killzone series, and the metro series. I've also heard the new robocop is pretty good (haven't played it myself though), and there's a remake of the original half life called black mesa that's pretty good.\n\nTo stretch our legs a bit further, there's also the fallout series, starfield, stalker 2, cyberpunk 2077, the deus ex series, and the remake of system shock, but those are more RPG/immersive sim than FPS, but are still first person and have decent gunplay.\n\nEdit: a word",
