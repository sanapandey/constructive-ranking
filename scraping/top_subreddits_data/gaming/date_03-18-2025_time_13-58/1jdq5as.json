It might not be stated directly, but the purpose of the upgrade appears to be to allow the other Geth to attain the level of individuality that Legion has.\n\n\nBut none of this makes sense (besides the seemingly unnecessary sacrifice). Because Legion's existence clearly establishes that Geth in sufficient numbers can simulate an individual consciousness. Legion is just a large number of Geth operating from a single platform.\n\n\nSo the \"upgrade\" seems to ignore that the Geth have this technological means already and seems to imply that it alters the Geth from a hivemind, consensus-based sentience to individualism. They could've just had the \"upgrade\" be a resilience to Reaper influence without destroying the Geth's uniqueness as if it were a bad thing to be eliminated.",

When Halsey is calling on the open channel, it's Kat who warns that answering will lead the covenant to them. She's shot by a sniper shortly after this.\n\nUnlike Jorge, Carter isn't kidding himself about his death winning any wars or saving any lives. He dies just to get 6 and Emile one step closer, never knowing if it's even worth it.\n\nAnd Emile is simply overwhelmed when attempting to hold his position. There's no ironic tragedy, no sacrifice for the greater good. He simply fails to hold his ground and dies. Kat's death at least pushes Carter to make sure the mission with Halsey succeeds. My poor boy Emile's death was truly meaningless to everyone, including him. And his death seals the fate of Noble 6.",

If you know what you're doing, you can prevent anyone from dying.\n\nFFVII is the first one where a member dies and nobody fills their gap, there is no way to save her, and she's not a guest character.  \n\nAll the other games have party members dying involved, but I think the severity and inevitable nature of VII's is why people feel like it's the \"first time.\"",

Oh no, *stab* and then the music\u2026oh the music. One of the most heartbreaking and shocking scenes for me that I literally cried through the subsequent battle. Still gets me to this day! \n\n2. Mordin Solas in Mass Effect 3. That sacrifice was incredible and the song he did right before is a testament to the growth of his character and the bond between the main character and him. Such an incredible performance. \n\n3. Brok in God of War: Ragnarok. I was completely taken by surprise when this scene happened and absolutely felt the pain in Sindri whenever he would appear on screen afterwards. The funeral scene was extremely touching and again the performances were incredible to watch. Definitely had a good tear up on that.",

She dies off screen between games which somewhat lessens the blow but a major story beat of the second game is the main character using a spell to resurrect her. It works for all of 10 seconds and is enough time for her to tell Yuri that she loves him before dying all over again. Which absolutely broke me. Then if that wasn't enough Yuri goes into his mind later on in the game and finds her again but he can't stay and has to leave again. Emotionally wise, this game left me a mess by the end of it.",

And in my first playthrough I did not got the true ending. So after the Final Boss fight a heroic sacrefice was neccesary in order to stop the big bad, save the country and the childrens families and hopefully end the war. All the children volunteered and it was up to me, the player, to decide which of these children gets to die this heroes death. I choose an 8 year old orphan girl. \nIt was certantly an impactful end for this character. Wappa is a self proclaimed leader but she genuinly wants to be the kind of leader that supports her so called \"Minions.\" She wants to her minions to be able to rely on her when they need help. Some other crew members play her like a fiddle by simply acknowledging her as leader and then ask her for help. Its an easy way to get her to do somthing. Wappa shows hoe far she is willing to go for her minions. For them she fights in a war, gets her hands bloody and if the situation demands it she even offers her life for them. She is a self proclaimed leader but she takes the responsebility of being a leader quite seriously. In the Link events the player can unlocked its shown that her whole Leader-Minions shtick comes from her insecurities of being an orphan. \"If I am not the leader I am just a silly lonly orphan.\" The thought that those insecurities might pushed her to volunteer, to fulfill the duity of a leader, is a sad thought. Again this ending is not canon. Wappa survives in the true ending and she is alive and kicking in the sequel which picks up after the true ending. But its still the hardest hitting Videogame death I experienced so far despite having achives the true ending 19 times alrady.",
