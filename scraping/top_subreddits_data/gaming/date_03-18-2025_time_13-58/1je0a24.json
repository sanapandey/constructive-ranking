Pretty rare. Imperial age is also rare to get to in 1v1s, let alone getting to post-imperial (having everything researched) AND still have gold for the fun units.\n\nI realized I wasn't anymore playing the game I like. I wasn't picking Byzantines because Cataphracts are cool or because pretty architecture. I wasn't picking Japanese for the convenience of cheaper camps. I was picking the meta civilizations because the AI doesn't give a shit about my fun, it just wants me to lose.\n\nAnd with friends, I'm way out of their league. I'm not super amazing at the game but they're definitely complete casuals, and we just can barely play. I can rush out a mangonel before they even get halfway through Feudal age.\n\nSo, I just stopped playing. There's no fun to be had here for me. Pushing further in the skill leads to a frustrating game that always seems to play the same. And all for what? The satisfaction of winning at a game I didn't sign up for? Give me back my 200 cataphracts armies!\n\nTL;DR: Competitive demands overoptimization that kills the appeal of the games and turns every match into more of the same old thing.

We have just had several large pro tournaments and they've showcased some of the best 1 v 1 gameplay we have ever seen. See Hera play Yo on a 'kill the king' match just this last weekend.\n\nIf you played age of empires 2 back in the day and think it seems dated, the definitive edition has improved it massively. Graphics, quality of life controls, mods.. It's all there. Could not recommend it enough for scratching that RTS itch. It's growing in popularity and the pro seen is surprisingly big given the age of the game. Good content creators on twitch and YouTube for it too, T90, Dave, Hera, Viper, Spirit of the Law...",

Your \"yeah, no\" is a bit rude, too. \n\nI specifically said: \"at lower skill levels\" \n\nThere is an excellent elo based skill matchmaking system.  If you want to play in a style that suits you simply drop down the levels until you CAN do what you want and still not have a game that finishes too quickly.  OF COURSE at higher levels the game is about having a build order. \n\nThere is enough variance in strategy that turtling is *absolutely* viable on most maps and at most skill levels.  That may depend on your exact definition of turtling, but yes, playing defensively and resisting an attack whilst building economy is a very, very standard way of playing.  \n\nI personally hate arena but at lower skill levels it is very much a slower game where you can turtle.  You can even resist castle rushes by just moving backwards and walling.  Ultimately the answer to your points are:  Simply drop your elo down to 100, or maybe even lower, and enjoy farming simulator for 45 minutes whilst you do what you want.",

To quote another commenter:\n\n>What really killed RTS games was they were not as profitable. One of the main reason RTS games were so popular in the past was because hardware limitations made it where few genres were enjoyable to the general public. It's the same reason why turn based RPG games became rare. As hardware progressed genres that were more action focused gained traction, and thus became the wiser investment. Now we have a lot of genres that older gamers loved and miss, but they have become such a niche market that they are few and far in-between.\n\nMOBAs may have leeched some of the playerbase. But, advancements in hardware that led to more action-oriented games left the genre far less popular and in turn, far less profitable.\n\n*edit: Also I'd like to add that high-quality RTS engines/systems seem to require a lot of resources to build. This is why there is not an RTS that has yet lived up to StarCraft 2 in terms of pathing and control. No big studios have attempted another RTS (profitability) and the smaller studios/indie devs can't seem to deliver a quality product (see: Stormgate).",

And it actually did pull a significant amount of audience. But with the way Blizzard handled the game's balance, trying to make it as competitive as possible, they inadvertently advertised what RTSes would become. When people saw what's happening, they ditched it for MOBAs and 4X/GSGs which are a lot easier and more fun oriented.\n\n\nAnd that slowly kills the player count. Even now, SC2's eSports future seems to be uncertain. Nobody knows as to whether or not there will be official tournaments or heck, even a World Championship. Still despite that, its quite fun to watch guys at the pro level go to town on each other. Sadly for Zergs their race in a piss poor state right now, to the point where even Serral can't get consistent wins. \n\n\nAnyways, just because one IP is on life support that doesn't mean the RTS genre as a whole is dying. Warcraft III is still alive and kicking (try to find an unofficial crack because Reforged is still kinda ass). And my personal fave, Star Wars: Empire at War, is still receiving support from Petroglyph (the developers). There are also newer titles like Gates of Hell which is a little different but very fun when you get into the groove.",

Where if you win or lose it is because of your own actions and not because of bad luck or because the mechanics rolled a \"fuck you\" on a dice roll. \n\nTo that end making a mechanically balanced game is pretty important, but the key is not to balanced it so hard that it stops being *interesting*. There's a lot of ways around that, such as the three different playstyles of SC's races, but an intense competitive scene will gradually work it's way towards units being completely homogenous stat blocks that bump up against each other. Similarly, you wouldn't want to play street fighter where absolutely every match was a mirror match of the same character.",

If the big pubs see no demand for the small stuff, then they won't bother making the big stuff. Not that RTSs being big will change the minds of those corpos, but at least it'll encourage others to give the genre a shot.

No. But at least give them an honest try, give your feedback if you bounced off the game, share the game with your friends if you have any and encourage them to try it out, mention the game if you see any posts like this one. Basically support the game in any way you can if you don't want to do it financially. \n\nSitting and questioning what happened isn't gonna do anything, we need to act.

Except they couldn't compete, had none or a minimal campaign and dried up very quickly. They usually shipped unbalanced out of the box with a fickle multi-player base because if the game sucked, well, one just went back to the classics, and if the skirmish modes/campaign single player experience was crap, well, RIP. That's it. No one's coming back. \n\nI did a lot of MP back in the day myself with Warcraft 3 and DoW, but that was because the single player experience was so immersive with the factions/story etc that I just wanted more. One thing just lead to another. \n\nOn the Supcom-like front, you have Beyond All Reason which is out and Sanctuary: Shattered Sun being developed. They are predominantly multi-player focused though! And there are certainly more RTS games being developed these days. It's just very much a smaller sphere compared to what it was in the 90's and 00's.\n\nThough I think it's also partially due to the playerbases who grew up with the old RTS classics just getting older with less time to want to devote to them. I adore games with that difficult challenge/reward structure with the Fromsoft Souls series and I find multi-player invasions often amusing and fun enough, especially in the older ones, but when I come home from work or study it's just hard to want to devote that remaining effort in learning the PVP multiplayer experience of RTS. Pvp multiplayer can be a lot of fun, but there is a very large effort to reward ratio involved usually. It's quite a lot more effort than even fighting games like Street Fighter for instance. \n\nIt would be really nice to see one focused on a deep and replayable single-player experience with thematic factions/story/atmosphere that you can immerse yourself in addtion to the multi-player. Preferably without a disappointing story ala Starcraft 2. I'd pay good money for a new Supcom-like one that could fill that sort of single experience myself. \n\nAlways hope for the future.",

They further leaned into special abilities in StarCraft 2, adding more UI convenience to it. RTS became more about managing the micro of your units in combat and less about base building. The natural end conclusion of this was games like DoTA.\n\nLarge army niche now goes to things like total war and ultimate general, but those are very different from the classic RTS. Today, the market is just not very dominant and so there isn't room for a lot of variety. Maybe we'll see something interesting hit that will bring a renaissance back, but I think RTS is mostly going to be a low diversity market for a long time.",

They start to pitch a game because theyre a much more reliable target audience than the opposite.\n\nAn adjacent genre that has the same problem is fighting games, which kinda shows why you don't always pitch solely to the casual fighting group. outside of obvious things like smash brothers, which has a lot of star power, games like Soul Calibur and Mortal Kombat have historically been pitched more as \"for the regular people\" fighting games, as they focused more on single player content compared to games like Street Fighter, or Tekken. Look at the current state that both Soul Calibur and Mortal Kombat is in now (ones functoinally dead, the others on financial life support).\n\nFighting games dev found out its better to focus on PVP, and slowly add in more single player content to get new players in, than do the opposite. AOE2 is an example thats currently doing this. (many expansions are PVP focused, but the last few have primarily been PVE focused to bring in new players)",

When RTS became popular, they were the best approximation, considering the technology limits, to the player fantasy of building huge fortresses and commanding giant armies, in real time. It didn\u2019t matter that in AoE your town only has 20 houses, or that your army only has 30 soldiers: at the time, that was the best possible, and your imagination did the rest.\n\nBut with time, we got 4X and city builders (and even sandbox games like factorio or Minecraft) getting always more satisfying and detailed in showing a growing, live city or empires, both at the level of mechanics and graphics. On the other hand, the fantasy about watching and fighting giant battles was taken over by games like the total war series, with technology actually allowing to simulate an army. Games like Supreme commander itself, while aiming in that direction, don\u2019t really get there. This leaves out smaller scale battles (like in company of heroes), but in this case turn tactics games like XCOM or panzer corps always provided a more detailed and \u201cpersonal\u201d competition. \n\nThis left classic RTS games without a clear niche in which they are the best possible solution to satisfy the player. \u00a0",

This lead to those other 99% migrating to MOBAs where you can be shit and still win.\n\nI miss RTS dearly, and I squarely blame its demise on internet matchmaking. No one gave a shit when we were playing StarCraft 1 over LAN, as they was no one in Korea playing against you with 500 APM.\n\nCheck out Sins of a Solar Empire and Sins of a Solar Empire II. It's not exactly an RTS, but it's the closest thing we've got. Hell of a game.",

You wanted to add MLRS rockets to the tank chassis, you could.  You wanted to make the fanciest most expensive units?  You can!  \n\n\n\nThere were 3 factions in 2150 and 4 in 2160.  They all had different units, one had heavy tracked vehicles and regular cannons, another one had hover/anti-grav vehicles with plasma  weaponry, the other had mechs...and so on.  Each side had a special type of weapon, like lasers that would overheat enemy units and kill them quickly, plasma had additive damage I think another one had EMPs to disable enemies which you could recrew and take over.  \n\n  \nAlso, the game had a subterranean layer as well so you could dig and mine underground and try coming up behind your enemies or inside their base. \n\n\n\nThe problem is that the AI was all knowing.

The multiplayer ruined singleplayer too- suddenly we all recognised that the CPU is never actually trying to win, it's just hanging around waiting for us to beat it. Suddenly players knew what an opponent playing to win looked like.\n\nIt's actually kinda similar (but different) to how fighting games have entered a mini-renaissance at the moment now that the information on how they work is freely available, and it turns out those games are waaaaaay more fun when played \"properly\" than they were button-mashing on the sofa with our friends.",
