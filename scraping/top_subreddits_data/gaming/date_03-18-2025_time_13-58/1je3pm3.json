Volition, after being shut down made statements about how the game\u2019s direction was changed to what it is now due to Deep Silver meddling with the development.\n\nAs for the game being a buggy mess on launch, Volition had been dealing with frequent staff cuts since the launch of Saints Row 2, so the studio likely didn\u2019t have the manpower left to make a game of the scope required for an open world crime crime.",

The 80s and 90s stuff has lots of cringe stuff as well, and obviously most of us grew up in that time period (or even earlier). We've lived through it, but I refuse to believe that you can't make good \"millennial\" characters or story lines, but if everything revolves around only the actual worst aspects ... hard to get into it. And, of course, there's the nostalgia bit, I will freely admit that. But there's good stories out there with more modern characters. The first Life is Strange takes place during the 2010s. And that story and the characters in it are great (in my opinion, at least).",

That's just how it is, unless you want to have some young and inexperienced writer take over a multi-million dollar franchise with barely any supervision. But maybe some conversations with actual younger team members or normal people ... not activists ... might help. It can work. We've seen it.

Theres an alternate universe where that first trailer was a complete fakeout and the game starts with those unlikeable characters who are pretending to be a gang, only to viciously murder half the cast a la Carlos in SR2, and having all the others rapidly change into real gang members. Still horrible for marketing, but once word got out that the tone of the game shifts sales \\*might\\* have recovered.",

You get dialogues written for total idiots. Stuff gets repeated, from off-screen (companions) you get \"tips\" what you actually need to do since the actual person does not say it or vaguely hints at it, convoluted and padded writing like the writers needed to reach a minimum number of lines for each dialogue, your dialogue choices could often times just be deleted and you would not miss ANYTHING and probably many more.",

You can easily tell a compelling and tight story via the video game medium. Grand Theft Auto, Halo 1-3, Starcraft, Mass Effect, and many other games have compelling writing that tell entertaining stories that you can engross yourself in. The problem is writers and level designers have to work together, you can't just write a script and slap gameplay around it or vice-versa.",

In other mediums writers don\u2019t have to make nearly as many concessions to their stories. It makes sense that the best talents will go to industries where the story is more integral to the experience.",

Naming a handful of what are considered some of the best narrative experiences in gaming isn\u2019t proof that my statement is bullshit. \n\nVideo game writers always talk about how unpredictable player behavior wreaks havoc on things like pacing and tone. Just because a game can have a good story doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bullshit that many writers avoid the medium because it\u2019s a challenge they\u2019d rather avoid. \n\nI know this is unpopular for the serial gamers who only know game stories anyways, but video game narratives struggle to hit the heights of other mediums like novels and films. It\u2019s just a fact. If you consume a lot of diverse media you will agree that objectively games are a challenging place to tell an iconic story because at the core of gaming, mashing buttons and ignoring exposition entirely is a central theme of the medium. And that\u2019s enough to turn some of the industries most talented people away to mediums where their writing is 100% of the substance, not 50%.",

Notice her only credit is this game even though she's supposedly been in the industry for 10 years.\n\nTurns out this game had tons of writers. Maybe why it feels so mish mashed and screwed up.",

I liked all of them up to and including 3. I played 4 but it felt like it jumped the shark a lottle.

The poster above implied such things were \"forced\", but I was trying to see if they'd admit that it was simply the option or presence of trans characters that set them off and nothing of the sort was \"forced\". There is a BIG difference between \"forced to take on a non traditional gender\" and \"forced to admit that non traditional gender ideologies even exist\". The latter is a silly position to take because, whether you like it or not, people DO live their lives as trans/non binary.

In veilgaurd, many of the characters' central mental conflict is gender or sexual issues. I think a lot of people think the games obsession with this stuff is off-putting for a supposed fantasy game. Because people want to buy a game and fulfill their fantasy of being a badass fighter and live immersed in a fantasy world, not have sit-down discussions about a characters mommy issues and gender related ptsd. \n\nSome people care about this stuff more than others, but it doesn't help to have a game that is mediocre as well because it makes it harder to overlook the bad writing.",

I'm a big Saints Row fan from 3 onwards (didn't get to play the earlier ones), and EVEN though they went continuously downhill from 3 onwards (too much repetition without actually moving forward, which was felt in the entire world and quest design, looking at you \"collect 1,000 cubes and 1,000 whatever it was in the demon world\"), they were still fun enough and brought at least something to the table (futuristic skyscraper running and power jumps, etc., demon wings and so on), and had entertaining stories. But the reboot. Fuck me, I worked on it as a translator and was already bored. When I got the game for free via the Epic weekly stuff, I vowed to at least give it a chance ... and couldn't make it past the tutorial. I was just so ... over it. The cringy characters, the nonsensical story (not in a good way, not silly, and stupid, but just ... stupid), and the bland gameplay just weren't enticing.  \n  \nSo, as much as I despise big corporations and their CEOs, the dude's right on the money here. The times where you could just sit around for a decade and not produce anything of value, while just chasing after any social trend are (hopefully) over. You need a clear vision, you need to follow that vision, not remake your entire game several times throughout the development process. Focus on your ACTUAL fans. Saints Row, like GTA, SHOULD be offensive, the more the better. And everyone is fair game. Fuck me, there's so many stereotypes that have been done to death, nobody needs to feel entitled to not belong to this prestigious group of people being made a bit of fun of.  \n  \nI guarantee you that the latest Saints Row game would have at least done \"okay\" had they not gone with stupid kids trying to \"pay back their student loans\" bullshit story line. Iron out the bugs and go wild. This more grounded approach wasn't Saints Row anymore. You can't just go back to being GTA light for dummies. And you can't just dump the iconic characters and crass humor. The actual gameplay on the other hand, isn't even \"that\" important in comparison, as long as the shooting and driving is at least fun.  \n  \nRIP Saints Row. It was nice while it lasted.   \n  \nTL;DR: The game lacked heart and soul. The lackluster gameplay was only the cherry on top of the shit cake.",

The cast and story weren't groundbreaking, but each character's motivations to form the Saints were pretty clear. They were cogs in their own machines who got screwed over and made their own gang. That's not original, but it's hardly incoherent. If anything, the game is maybe a little too corny compared to previous entries as there is very little biting cynicism in the game as a whole.

Whatever the case it's always either someone not knowing what they are doing or/and they go against what is expected and wished for by fans or right for the game. With the industry being filled with lots and lots greedy and opportunistic scumbags I can imagine many scenarios where talented developers are held back because of greed or/and political reasons. In case of this reboot they knew perfectly well what they wanted to make. It's simply that whatever they wanted to make, just like Netflix and Amazon's turdshows (Rings of Turd and Witches of Aretuza) or Veilguard, was going against what fans and players wanted. And these people in charge did not deliver on those expectations and promises because they are narcissists and have an ideology. Their lack of talent is just one part of the equation. I've seen that diversity for hire bowtie wearing black [pacifist technician ](https://youtu.be/b7RPQMBhVcM?feature=shared&t=120)in so many other shows and games.\n\nThere has been countless instances of studios being polluted by ideologues/radical activists. As Gandalf said\n\n# \u201cThere is only one lord of the ring, and he does not share power\"\n\nIn this case, you're fool if you think these ideologues who are employed, part of many games production, care about you as a gamer or person. Unless you're part of their ideology your wishes and expectations will be relegated to an afterthought, if they can afford it (creative control), even if your the demographic that primarily plays said game. What I said about ideologues also applies to greedy scumbags that have title \"monetisation officers\", whose job is to squeeze money out of studios.\n\nAnother note about out of touch executives and such. ESG funding is a way for ideologues to pollute games with their ideology (so called checklists). Many monetisation officers and managers probably get higher salaries, by way of ESG funding, if they peddle ideology and corrupt shit. Topic is very nuanced so I will stop here.",
