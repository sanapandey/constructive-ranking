In short:\n\n* If a VA is recording from overseas (applies to the newly-appointed Side Global VAs), must-join does not apply\n* If the US side of the project is being recorded in a right-to-work state (for Side Global, it would be their Charleston studio), must-join does not apply\n* Other agreements may apply, which might be what's important here as SAG-AFTRA [actually requested to reach out to HoYo in the past](https://x.com/sagaftra/status/1692659550636097880)\n\nThere is a non-zero chance that Genshin has become a SAG-AFTRA project, and that they are starting to recover.",

Full members cannot work on non-union projects, but the videogame industry was not really enforced so they voiced in Genshin. Now that they're on strike, the union is keeping a keen eye and they cannot voice act in Genshin as it is a non union project. Fi-core members have the option to voice act in non union projects but they have access to less privileges in the union. There exist some striking fi-core members and even non union VAs to show solidarity with the strike. The voice actors that are available right now for Genshin are non American VAs, non union VAs and fi-core members choosing to VA.\n\nSAG-AFTRA is a tough topic because they essentially want to monopolize the American VA industry. Hoyo has very real reasons to not sign the interim contract because essentially they would have to recast all of the non-union VAs.",

However, since the SAG negotiating committee wants to help NU actors keep their jobs during and after this strike, it is possible for productions to negotiate a waiver for that rule.\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/kelatonin.bsky.social/post/3lkbyofsygc2w\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/kylemccarley.com/post/3lkadq24huc2j\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/kylemccarley.com/post/3lkadq3hjs32j\n\n> Actors that work jobs exclusively in Right-to-Work states can't be compelled to join. The interactive committee could offer a waiver to ensure it's signed. The chances of even a single actor being replaced because a game flips from non-union to union is microscopic.

You can just join Fi-Core and opt out of some of your benefits in exchange for the ability to work on *every single project in the industry*. In fact, that's basically the only way a VA can (legally) be in that position (hence why most actors consider, again, highly desirable).",

However, the acting industry overall (where individual short projects make the money rather than continuous work) is also far from normal. Shifting the membership costs to be more front-loaded to prevent people from gaming the system seems reasonable to be. If the $3000 was always required to be a lump sum I'd actually agree with you (as not everybody has that cash just lying about) but they're happy to offer payment plans.\n\n> You\u2019re going to pretend you\u2019re not a \u201cSAG cheerleader\u201d but you outright defending them in this case shows me otherwise.\n\nYou haven't asked me what my issues with them are (and I haven't added them because they're a bit wordy and not directly related to the current conversation). I can detail them if you'd like.\n\n> Being against SAG doesn\u2019t make somebody anti union.\n\nAgreed. However, parroting unsourced conspiracy theories is anti-union behaviour. Again, I'll happily outline my own grievance with SAG if you're willing to go a bit off-topic.",
