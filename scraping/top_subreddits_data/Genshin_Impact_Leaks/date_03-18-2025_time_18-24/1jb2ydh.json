Furina teams also assume 4pc MH for the damage ceiling which many ppl might not want to run bc it makes him bound to her/feel ass in overworld.\n\nIfa striggering 4pc scroll for consistent 40% dmg bonus and doing more than like 12k DPS would be an upgrade over Furina",

You can't really just roll away with that because it will rouse player's expectations (and it did...for 5 years straight until Natlan came out).

Rolling away with a mistranslation mean they would have to add the same information to CN, JP and KR. And both CN and JP loves Murata Himeko. They would just shoot themselves in the foot.",

Jean was Anemo and was the Acting Grandmaster, Nigguang (Geo) was leading Liyue, Inazuma had Yae, Sumeru had Al Haitham and Fontaine had Neuvillete. All of these nations had people with real governing positions within their nation, so it would've been real awkward to have a vet there besides them. \n\nThe \"co-leader\" for Natlan is the Traveller in this case, so that's why I thought it was highly unlikely for Ifa to be Pyro, could've been any other element, but was likely going to be Anemo in the end.",

It's because a lot of shit went down 500 years ago\", \"Oh there's some magical problem that has a long explanation? Simplify it by saying it's leyline problems\", even this \"co-leader has to be an actual leader with the same element as the Archon\" pattern is something that has happened in 5/7 nations, so if Ifa didn't have a leadership position, it was more likely that he wasn't going to be Pyro than being Pyro. \n\nHell, Natlan even has its own pattern, and that is \"every character will follow their tribe's corresponding elements and Saurian ability\" and that has been true for every character EXCEPT Ororon. If 8/9 Natlan characters follow this pattern (excluding Mavuika) then what is more likely? Ifa NOT following this pattern, or following it?",

And he's anemo...\n\nOk so here's what I am hoping for his gameplay...he's going to be a healer/sub dps, who can hold Cinder City scroll, and here's where I'm predicting.....\n\nHis skill is that his bird is going to have the same mechanism as Chasca/Lanyan, that his bird will absorb the elements in the team if they're Pyro, Electro, Cryo, Hydro and then spit them out as mini nukes at the enemy...his Ult will heal the team of course. \n\nTeam can be Kinich, Mauvika, Benny, Ifa. \nIf this works, then Benny Ult, Mauvika skill, Ifa can use skill, his bird will absorb pyro and shoot pyro nukes, and then you switch to Kinich? Or benny ult, Mauvika skill, Kinich and then Ifa for heals. Maybe his clothes will change color to know what element he absorbed..that would have been cool..\n\nIdk...maybe I'm just coping...",

Mono-element teams already exists and some of them are really good but this would give them something new. And the fact that he is a Natlan anemo so he could be run on either VV or Scroll depending on what your team favors seems cool.\n\nWhat I especially like about this idea is that it wouldn't buff the best DPS's, Neuvi's A1 makes him want more elements in the team, Arle and Mavuika prefer melt a lot mroe than mono pyro, but for example cryo DPS's are not getting much love and making them busted with a Shenhe+Ifa (or well, this kit idea for him) combo could be a solution.
