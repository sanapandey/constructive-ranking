It's rare but it all has one thing in common, which is that you want grouping. This means an anemo. So this character is already DOA.\n\nContinuing on though it doesn't get better. Cryo characters who currently exist don't want this. Cryo have access to Blizzard strayer if things are freezable. If not you can still get aura and get half value. In addition, cryo resonance requires a cryo aura. Now, on unfreezeable enemies, you will add a hydro and lose cryo resonance so 15% crit, and older cryo that use BS also lose 20% crit. While Wrio can use MH he'd still be losing crit from resonance loss. This freeze team is already in the hole on bosses. \n\nHydro DPS we're basically talking about 2 characters. A limited element team for Neuv loses a stack. Mualani is not going to gain by giving up forward vape. \n\nLet's contrast this with Chev. Overload doesn't have the same overlap as freeze for wanting an anemo right off the bat. Neither pyro nor electro resonance nor any of their sets require an aura. Pyro and electro are asymmetrical, meaning pyro has access to amp reactions but electro does not. Overload is currently bis for Clorinde and Raiden, but not for the pyros. Cryo and hydro have some asymmetry. Cryo only has access to reverse, hydro has access to both forward and reverse. However both have access to amp reactions. In other words there's an obvious use case for Chev teams for elements without access to good damaging reactions but you're again starting from the hole for both elements here. Now you could suggest Skirk herself doesn't want amp for whatever reason and this is just a bundle, but then this unit isn't a Chev style unit at all but rather a dedicated support.",

This is also how phys should be revived - simply do MORE characters of this type and not 1854815871 pyro dps, that's it\n\nBut I would like to see some small rework of freeze anyways, to be able to have some sort of cryo dot on enemy which can stack up and freeze boss (for example cryo+hydro will create aura like quicken and it will count next hydro or cryo application and after like 3-5 applications boss will be frozen). Cuz bosses not getting frozen also affects shatter, which makes Freminet dirty already and can affect future characters as well.",

They've been buffing Spiral Abyss a lot lately and with them removing certain comps like Hydro-focused ones in the next Spiral Abyss rotations, it will mean that if people are too focused on a team or two and they nerf those teams while also continually buffing enemies, more and more people will start to feel the difficulty like people in HSR already do.\n\nI know Genshin has a more rexlaxed Spiral Abyss, but so did HSR with MoC and PF in the past, they used to be much, much easier only months ago with people doing 0 cycles and even doing it on Auto, then the HSR team decided to artificially increase the endgame difficulty and most people, even content creators started complaining about the difficulty being excessively high.\n\nThe last battle event was really hard as I kept retrying for hours because none of my friends had cleared floor 20 in single player without any buffs. So I had to do 21 in two stages, while 20 on another two and 18 on the Anemo one, because I wasn't able to bruteforce it with my other teams and my Anemo teams - I have all Anemo units, except Xinyuan and Mizuki - weren't strong enough to clear it. I ended up staying all night up one day and finished it around 4 a.m., so the mentality that \"Genshin is casual and will always stay like that\" is slowly, but surely becoming less and less true.\n\nBasically, never say never and if people start struggling with the game, they will feel incentivized to pull new meta units and to build their best teams, which is exactly what miHoYo wants and is already doing with HI3rd, HSR and to a lesser extent for now, ZZZ. Though ZZZ's v2.0 will arrive in a few months and I'm sure they will up the difficulty considerably to make 1.X characters less effective and incentivize people to pull 2.X characters and their whole BiS teams. Creating problems and selling the solutions are what Gacha games are all about and how they make so much money.",

I went from C3+Jade to C6R1 so Furina's personal damage increased considerably too. C6 Furina is just such a gamechanger, I'd recommend it to anyone as their first C6, opens up so much",

And Genshin\u2019s big success is that it found a middle ground where the characters are clearly fan servicey, but it\u2019s fine because they\u2019re\u2026well\u2026characters.   And while there were always exceptions, like Fischl, their designs usually reflected that character first and foremost.  It\u2019s part of why Fontaine\u2019s cast was so beloved, I think.\n\nI forget who used the term in another thread about Varesa, but \u201crandomized fetish generator\u201d is an incredible way of describing a lot of what we\u2019ve seen in terms of Natlan designs. \n\nWhy is Xilonen a roller skating SoCal DJ? Why is Mizuki maid themed despite running the bathhouse and being a dream eating psychologist?  Why does Varesa look less like a Luchadora, and more like some random girl into Japanese fashion subcultures?  Why is Mavuika a biker chick?\n\nFor all of them, it\u2019s literally just because it\u2019s hot and appeals to a specific niche of anime fans.  No other particular reason, really.\n\nI don\u2019t even dislike all of them(Mavuika might be my second favorite Archon design, actually), and can appreciate these kinds of designs when it\u2019s a one-off thing\u2026but this is just too much.\n\nThe one thing I\u2019ll give Effie is that *hopefully* her design at least ties into her character.

                    "body": "Agreed, I genuinely would be way less pissed about the male character situation if the neverending waifu stream at least felt like it had variety. It feels like everybody is either cute and nice and morally upright, or hot and nice and morally upright. Nobody feels unique (ig mavuika is uniquely bland lol?), because they all feel more like fanservice tropes and niches instead of like, actual people.\n\nAnd I'm not even against fanservice, but it's possible to make fanservice characters that actually feel interesting instead of flat and 2 dimensional. I play zzz and I love most of the female characters, and they're much heavier on the fanservice than genshin is. Like idk, nicole is super fanservice-y and her main design appeal is (partially) having big tits, but she just feels so much more lifelike than any recent genshin women (and she's not even a 5 star lol).\n\nEither way, genshin suddenly course changing to essentially being a waifu-only fanservice design game is shitty, because they baited a large portion of the playerbase into investing into the game with the false understanding that the game wouldn't randomly stop making the content that appealed to them. Waifu only games are fine, but they should be clear about it, instead of baiting people in and then giving zero shits about their gameplay experience outside of giving them the bare minimum to try to keep them from quitting entirely.\n\nBut man, they could at least try being good at being a waifu only (mostly) game. Hoyo can clearly make interesting female characters, so idk why they decided to stop doing it in Genshin.\n\nedit: and also, the other really annoying part is that every time I express my issues with how genshin designs and writes female characters post-fontaine is that people always accuse me of just hating all female characters, being a puritanical prude who thinks all gacha characters should be covered up like nuns, or pull out the \"male characters don't sell\" (which like, yeah, when you put them out so rarely, why would anyone swipe when they've had primos accumulating for a year and no husbando to spend them on?). or, possibly my least favorite, the whole \"gacha games are for men\" where they imply that female/non-straight male players are intruders or something, making the fandom worse, and don't deserve content made for them despite spending time/money on the game too.\n\nwhich, firstly, genshin's playerbase is 55% male and 45% female. kinda crazy to say that a company shouldn't even try to release content for almost half of their playerbase. there's also a reason why genshin became so popular and mainstream compared to previous gacha games- possibly the fact that it almost doubled the demographic of people interested in playing it by not being waifu-only? I think zzz is objectively better than genshin in most aspects rn, and it's my favorite hoyo game, but that's also part of the reason why it's a lot more niche (though still very successful overall) compared to genshin and hsr, because the majority of female hoyo game players have no interest in playing it due to the lack of male characters.\n\nand, lastly, the other reason why alienating almost half of the playerbase is bad is that most female players actually pull a lot of female characters, whereas men are less likely to pull male characters. people act like waifu banners doing well are purely because of male characters and female players are only swiping on the husbando banners that sell worse (which also isn't always true), but a fair amount of the waifu banner pulls are coming from female players. \n\nI know a lot of hoyo game players irl (like approx 25 different people, 2/3rds female), and every single woman is regularly pulling/swiping for female characters. but - unsurprisingly - almost everyone I know quit genshin lmao. Even my straight male friends quit, because why spend your time/funds on bland waifus when you can go play zzz/hsr/etc and pull characters you actually find interesting and likeable? \n\nThere are still female players sticking around in hopes that natlan was a fluke and it'll be better in the future, but that's not going to last forever. If genshin continues as it is, they're going to eventually quit and go play games that actually want them as customers. \n\nsorry for the essay btw LMAO, I just feel pretty strongly about it. I used to love genshin, so the entire situation is so annoying for me, especially with how some people act like we're wrong for having any issues with it and don't deserve content made for us in the first place :/",

It's precisely why the \"go play LADs\" argument doesn't work. I just want a regular game, I hate characters flirting with the MC (totally regardless of whether I self insert or not) and I play genshin precisely *because* it's not that kind of game. For example I love Wriothesley almost as much as my life but if he started flirting with MC it would literally ruin his entire character for me.\n\n\nTbh people have got to quit pretending \"genshin was a waifu game all along\" when characters like Zhongli, Kazuha, Alhaitham, Neuvillette, etc have existed throughout the game's entire life. Genshin built up a reputation over 4 long years, as one of the *very few* regular games that cared at all about their female demographic. Switching now feels like betrayal lol",

When you compare Genshin character designs to the majority of people in East Asia, particularly the Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean peoples, the body fat of Genshin characters are already pretty normal and average.\n\nLifestyle and nutrition is particularly key here too, as far as world-building goes. Body fat is generally kept to a minimum when you live on more natural foods and live a very active lifestyle, which is typical for most of the people of Teyvat. There are genetic aspects to it too, but still, my point holds true: the female cast of Genshin are mostly average-sized women -- average for the region in which the developers live.",

It is a bit *too* much of a coincidence that the \"fake leak\" also referred to Effie as being a cryo support, and almost corroborated the character design (albeit they said it looked like Asuna).\n\nHere's my comment trying to summarize the leak from the deleted leak post:\n\n\"Looks interesting **if** real. Cryo *really* needs a boost.\n\nEDIT: Literally Shenhe with healing and hydro boost lol?\n\nEDIT2: Without the whole quill thing. So better?\n\nEDIT3: Since this got deleted. Here's the link for anyone curious: [https://imgur.com/a/BAereez](https://imgur.com/a/BAereez)\n\nAnd here's the info: 5.6 polearm freeze cryo support. Hydro & Cryo res down 45%, if team only has those elements. Atk scaling team-wide healing on initial cast, single target regen afterwards. Off-field cryo app, 1 hit per second, 3 cryo applications (once every 2.5 sec). DMG is comparable to Furina.\n\nLooks like Asuna from that lame ass Sword Art Online anime.\"",

Akeffi is basically the buff to freeze teams. \n\nBut her c1 allegedly allows team flexibility as you can add one non cryo or hydro character and still get the full res shred. \n\nSo TLDR I'm saving for c1 Akeffi or whatever her name is then going all in for Skirk with whatever is left.",
