Outside that, most of the time it's just - login to get Welkin and if I have the energy, do dailies. Usually farming is done on weekends only.\n\nI much prefer to roam the open environment and open chests with my wife in co-op. So I mostly leave chests alone for that reason. I unlock statues and waypoints for convenience, but roaming around defeating enemies and completing puzzles together brings me the most joy.\n\nWorld exploration of the environment is my favourite part of Genshin. Listening to the music and discovering gorgeous and cool places is wonderful. Delving into antediluvian ruins and finding lost treasures is both relaxing and engaging at the same time.\n\nEdit: Spelling",

Do you not think all limited-rewards and limited time events, limited character banners, etc. are all FOMO? When an event lasts for 1 or 2 weeks do you not understand that's still FOMO? The game is built on it like all gachas, that hasn't changed from the first version. There are people who hate that model so they don't play and I can understand that but it seems weird to specifically hate one of the more lenient examples of it yet presumably continue to play the game.",

FOMO is pretty scummy but it's optional for you. You don't have to care. Either the primos matter to you and you were on top of all the other events anyway that they'd hypothetically be taking this cut from, in which case honestly not a big deal at all. Or you skip most events because you can't be bothered to keep up with the time limits and this is actually more ideal because it's way more lenient. Even if you don't if you're already not completing most of the events and just playing casually you're still just skipping primos same as always. The only ones I see this hurting are those who play consistently but don't like to explore or who like to leave it and do it all at once. \n\nSo yes it's not good but that doesn't just apply to this specific case, that's literally everything the game is built on.

So yeah rushing players to finish those exploration within 3 months when it's literally a permanent content (that I can do over a couple years) is a bit of an asshole move. And for every patch they gave us exploration FOMO events, the normal limited time events are more scarce/gives less primogems. Because those FOMO exploration primogems counts into the primogems per patch count. Effectively, yes. Permanent exploration enjoyer DOES GET LESS primos as a result of these FOMO exploration patch.",

Although Caribert said that replacing them with the Loom of Fate was nigh impossible, it seems weird to me that they'd go out of their way to establish this arcane machine, which is the entire purpose of the Abyss Order and the Sibling until this point, and say very loudly \"this thing can write new leylines\" just before Natlan's storyline.\n\nThe Loom of Fate, which Traveler likely forgot about due to memory loss in 4.7, gives a fantastic opportunity to one day fix everything wrong with Natlan, and the rest of the world. (With the memory manipulation aspect, it could even be used benevolently to rewrite Natlan's leylines in such a way that they don't lose their cultural history as Mavuika was fearing.) Theoretically, any reason for Capitano to remain bound to the throne would cease once it is fully employed, because it would render what Capitano and the Lord of the Night are both doing to be obsolete.\n\nSo, my speculation is that once the Loom of Fate plotline reaches its apex, that will set the stage for Capitano's return.",

Like people who still say not pulling for x char is a skill issue is so mentally ill to actually defend a system like this on a game that barely has nothing.",

The only eligible characters to do those are Miyabi and Ellen, as there are no other forms of ice dps. I 9 starred it which means I 3 starred with Ellen.\n\nAlso, I use Lighter as my Fire dps and always 3 star with him. He's M0 and so is my Burnice who I pair with him. Not even her sig Wengine. This isn't a meta team, just what I wanted to do.\n\nAre you sure about the stance you're taking?",
