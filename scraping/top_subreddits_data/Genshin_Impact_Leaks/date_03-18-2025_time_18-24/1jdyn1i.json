Let alone Artifact Set Designs aside, it's like everything is settled for a Skirk at the end of Natlan (most likely 5.7 or 5.8. During 5.6 it's still possible but unlikely. 5.8 can still be Dahlia given the proximity of Nod-Krai to Monstadt + Varka and Frederica being around there currently. 6.0 will be someone still unknown tho). And we're still missing a weekly boss for Natlan, which can be brought either by Mavuika, a world quest tho VERY unlikely, or why not Skirk herself ? As for what the weekly boss would be, feel free to imagine because after that Abyss Dragon finale I wonder many things.",
