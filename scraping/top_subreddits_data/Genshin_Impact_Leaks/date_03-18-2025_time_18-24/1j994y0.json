What was lost is not the same. The perceived outcome for each individual is not the same.\n\nFor the group who used the elixirs, they're gone. Genshin decided to make them extremely scarce compared to other gachas, and difficult to get. You must explore, *lose items from trade ins* etc to get the elixirs. For those who made bad relics, they lost all that effort and it is extremely negative. Materials are gone, their time and resource investment (remember you must trade in relics) are gone.\n\nFor the group that saved them, they still have elixirs. They lost a possible chance to have rolled them *in a bad RNG system where the chance was lower to begin with*. \n\nIf you refund them, the group who saved is down nothing and never had and then lost anything. They are now guaranteed to get a \"good\" (2 rolls, whatever your standards are) roll anyway. \n\nThe outcome for refunding is just so clearly better for everyone. Not to mention, those that saved should probably not feel extremely bad considering they will know the system was so bad before that it warranted changing, and it took other people spending to discern this. Meaning the second group gains from the first group who gets refunded. \n\nIt is scarcely even a matter of debate imo the choice to refund is simply the best outcome and the groups are vastly asymmetrical.",

But again the gap between what they could have gotten vs what they are now guaranteed to get is so small that the extra chance with a worse system is miniscule. Compared to the other group, there is no contest. And again, this group who saved would not have this new system with significantly better odds if not for the first group, so in a very indirect way they owe a debt.\n\nLimiteds going to standard banner isn't a good comparison because those people are correct, they spent potentially $1k+ on C6 for these units under the presumption that it would be the only way to get them. It would pretty justifiably make spenders turned off. However no money is on the line here, except maybe some of these elixirs are BP I don't remember. But they would like a refund so again not comparable.\n\nI think it would be pretty unreasonable for anyone who saved them to complain, it feels like a bit of a stretch. If anyone who saved them wants to complain to me and disagree have at it but I don't think they're likely to make a compelling case. I think I pretty much covered why anyone who would complain is on pretty shaky ground.",

Have you considered the possibility that they flat out ignore certain feedback?\n\nI will give you a tangible example you cannot ignore or excuse: The claim all feature from map expedition, was one of the, if not the most, requested features in Genshin from the very first feedback form they released. Do you know or remember which version they finally introduced it? I do: 4.3 version in 2023! So it took 3 years to introduce something all players have been  asking for since actual launch.\n\nArtifact loadouts may not have been the most requested feature when 1.0 dropped, I never even thought about it back then, but it has been consistently the most requested feature since Inazuma the very least. Sweats, casuals, in between every single person can only benefit from this. I mean, if they bothered to create a sorting system which they called \"loadouts\" which nobody specifically asked for and is trying to emulate the idea of loadouts (but fails miserably) isn't it painfully clear that they SAW the feedback but fumbled the execution? They named it LOADOUTS. How much more of a dead give away do you need? That was their sorry attempt and to my understanding because they have done \"something\" about it, they are safely ignoring for the time being.\n\nPlease don't defend, but scrutinise them when the feedback comes. The game will only improve not worsen with such features. People need to remain united on this not blame each other.",

You don't know how many of those daily 4.5 mil players are actually requesting of this feature. You are just making an assumption like the other dude I replied to based on \"reddit vocal players\".\n\nIt's simple process of elimination given their track record and the existence of \"loadouts\" (which is actually artifact sorting): they don't care about the player base.

But you yourself showed that CD is comparable per roll and Tao isn't even the best example. \n\nActual HP scalers get more from HP roll than her and 2X amp carries get more from EM.\n\nIf you wanna argue about maxing CR being a first priority, I absolutely agree. \n\nBut thats not what you say, you say it isn't worth looking at other substats pre 30 CV, which is nonsense.",

Don't try to remake the wheel with nonsensical nitpicking. The difference in value between CR and CD in my example only arise from the fact that every character start with more CD than CR and Hu tao is a CD scaler with a CD weapon, so CR inprove the stats balance\n\nPlus Hu tao IS the textbook example of amplification carry and as i demonstrated, CD still scales better than EM even with an hyper optimized build... EM's diminushing return is a real thing while CV don't have anything as such as diminushing return contrarly to the popular belief. So yeah, as long as your Hu tao got the bare minimum EM the 10 CD + 10 CD IS better than the 10 CR + 70 EM and i can prove it, OR you can do some research to educate yourself and stop bothering others",

And no, Melt and Forward vape absolutely gain more value from EM. Hu Tao is a texbook example for reverse vape, but you are mistaken if you think that she gains as much from EM as say Gaming, Mavuika or Mualani who access 2X vs 1.5X that Tao gets.\n\nRegarding CD, it would be obviously equal to CR in a vacuum. But it simply is regular to have way over 200 CD and for CR to be slightly less than 100. We are arguing about generalizations here, stat values depend on characters, weapons and sets.\n\nThere are absolutely cases where Crit rolls dwarf in value other stats, but we got new sets that gives 36 CR or 64 CR, ascensions are always crit and good weapons are crit. When drowning in crit, getting super high values of CD and nearly capping CR, CR is of course more valuable to balance the ratio.\n\nWhy are you being so stubborn by clinging to an obviously stupid statement is beyond me honestly, especially when you can just get more overall rolls of other stats vs just cv that you compare it to.\n\nI got a Tao feather with 22.6 CV but 90 EM and 10 HP% for example, having a CV generalization is nonsense when you simply need to compare the amount of useful rolls and how useful they are for the character.\n\nThe difference per value per stat is simply not high enough to be ignoring lower CV but overall higher quantity of useful substat artifacts vs higher CV artifacts.",

Yeah it checks out \n\n>Why are you being so stubborn by clinging to an obviously stupid statement is beyond me honestly, especially when you can just get more overall rolls of other stats vs just cv that you compare it to.\n\nIts not beyond stupid when i have Neuvillette, Xiao, Childe, Ganyu, Raiden, Furina, Navia, Clorinde, Nahida, Tighnari, etc... All at top 1%, or top 2%. You do you  i guess but i'm about sure that your understanding of my whole point was a strawman all along because i never stated that CV was all that mattered for a good build but only that i was only keeping 30CV + artifacts. It doesn't mean that i dont use artifacts with 70 EM, it means that my EM artifacts have 70 EM AND 30+ CV. Now think what you want about trashing your 20 CV pieces but this is how i operate. I played for more than 3 years, farm artifacts every days but i never went past 260 leveled pieces because i have extremely high standards that don't include mid pieces",

I haven't gotten more than 3 total crits on these, but they are often quite strong because they usually have EM and ER and stuff like that.\n\nI usually hope to get good 4-liners to work with the circlets, but it is RNG, so everyone's luck may vary with just getting them naturally from domains.\n\n  \nAlthough I will usually probably attempt for a good sands, I think this makes crafting goblets much more valuable than circlets, because of the relatively reasonable chance of getting at least 5 crit substats or even if 4, then hopefully the other substats are useful.

The game is about playing the odds, right?\n\nIf I look at my account, as a 1.0 player who has hardly used elixirs, I have about 20 really good sands (generally high crit), 10 really good goblets (generally high crit), and 40-50 really good circlets (but not really such high crit). It's been pretty easy to get rainbow circlets. \n\nSo, how does one hedge their bets on crafting RNG? Well, the easiest to get are flowers and feathers, so even at 1 cost, I'm not going to make those. It's easy to get crit here, so I'm going to generally want high crit here. \n\nBoth crafted sands and gobs are already close to good by default just by guaranteeing 4 crit substats. So, I know that my chances of adding to my 20 good sands are really high at 2 cost. It's the same for gobs, but I might only do it sparingly.\n\nAs for circlets, even crafted circlets have a 25% of not rolling crit and rolling the other stat. Well, I already have 40+ rainbow circlets with mixed useful stats. And like you said, we don't always need crit stats. So, therefore, my circlets are the ones in which I shift my non-crit needs onto. \n\nNow, what if I did get a crazy circlet with all crit substats and the rest are level useful substats? Well, that might be really useful on a certain character, but that's not really that important, exactly because my goal doesn't need to be to get max crit all the time. I could just simply proceed with my current plan, which is get most crit stats from flower to goblet, and do rainbow on circlet. \n\n\\------\n\nIn sum, thanks to 5.5 I can try invest in crit in sands mainly, so that I can have a nice core of crit stats in flower to sands, especially because it is 2 cost for sands and offset the rest to circlets. It's the most efficient way. \n\nBasically, the cost of 3 for circlets is the reason why I consider it costly. If it were 2 cost, that would change a lot. \n\nAnd there is still too much chance that the circlet could still end up rainbow like all the ones I already have. But even if it helped me get a crazy perfect circlet, I may not really need it that much, because with all the elixirs I have saved up, I have a much much higher chance of having good to great to near perfect sands and gobs. Then I can just use my current really good rainbow circlets.",

Then there is no way Genshin will do it...\n\nThis is litterally how Hoyo works... They want people to think that their newer games are better than Genshin\n\nAnd as far as I know (correct me if im wrong though) but most of Genshin's \"Big QoL\" are from their other newer game (HSR/ZZZ), never from Non-Hoyo games...\n\nMap update on Genshin 4.0 for example its kinda like HSR map level system... \"Dialogue Log\" option that genshin get are basically from HSR (I forgot when they get that QoL) and ZZZ already have it since that game release... Or Sanctifying Elixir system on Genshin 5.0 are obviously from HSR's Self-modelling resin system (Even though its better than what HSR have, but the item itself are kinda Hard to get and expensive to use, so there is a catch for it)\n\nThats why if they didnt have Loadouts on either HSR or ZZZ, then there is no WAY they will add it to Genshin first... Lets be real, they want their newer game to \"feel better\" than their previous game, but if they didnt have a certain QoL on these \"better game\" then there must be a reason why they really dont want people to have it...\n\nThe only think that I know Genshin does originally are their new Daily system (on 4.8) that kinda different from other Hoyo game (they basically using points that you get from \"playing the game\" so you can just spend 120 Resin or convert it to 3 Condensed Resin to skip the Daily Quest)...",

I've seen and been one of the people that have lost 50/50 over 5 times in a row, almost 10 times in a row in HSR. Same as in Genshin before Capturing Radiance. And at first, I honestly disliked the idea of Capturing Radiance, until I realized it basically enables double guaranteed characters, provided you lose 3-4 times in a row (3 seems to be the average). Helps that you don't get punished if you're lucky and rarely lose 50/50. It's actually what enabled me to get Mavuika and Citlali back-to-back.",

The game has a clear flaw in artifacts since D1, where you need months (6 - 7 - 8 and sometimes more) to get a decent gear, and even though HSR / ZZZ already implemented a BETTER system to craft artifacts, people are just there to say \"wow amazing, now I can roll 1 crit 1critdmg and 3 flat def and be happy\"\n\nI wish the genshin community would wake up and realize Hoyo is just fucking around with us instead of being brainwashed by minor / useless QoL.",

So instead of getting between 0 and 5 rolls on what you want, you get between 2 and 5, it's objectively a good change for the unluckiest people while not changing it for the lucky people, which I feel makes the system fairer, it's less reliant on RNG to at least get a decent result for something you're consuming rare materials on",

No wonder people are getting tired of this game when hoyo doesn't listen at all",
