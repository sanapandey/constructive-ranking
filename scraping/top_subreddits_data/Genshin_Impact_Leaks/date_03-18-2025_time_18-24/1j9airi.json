So uhh...you do know Iansan still has lines despite them not being voiced in AQ, a whole interlude to herself, and 92 lines in Mauvika's personal quest even though they aren't voiced in english right?\n\nThere's also the fact that every other current playable natlan character has \"About Iansan\" lines about her with even Mavuika having two lines especially for her.\n\n>Even Dainsleif mains have more to grasp on than you lmao.\n\nAnd comparing Dainsleif of all characters like he has barely any lore is kinda cringe ngl\n\nIt's giving \"I don't pay attention to other characters that interest me\" imo",

The only characters I have not rolled for are like 5 of them, and most recent ones past 2.1 are sigewinne and baizhu. Her lines are mostly of little consequence, and the lack of voice acting in EN (which the person I replied to uses it seems since they seem so passionate about her being voiced), makes the character unremarkable to say the least. \n\nShe is just not memorable, just a fitness trainer who has been hyped up to be the one Mavuika trusts to take her place in a time of crisis, if Mavuika dies or gets put out of commission for whatever reason... only to NEVER show anything of considerable strength or similar to back up this statement. Quite literally the most nothingburger character Mihoyo has come up with in Natlan. \n\nThe only time she had a semi active role was the interlude in 5.2, where she was yet again not voiced, and Capitano was the most intriguing character by far there, completely eclipsing her.",

Legit all I remember Iansan blabbering about is Paimon's fitness program lol. \n\nReally goes to show also that you guys can come up with no good arguments over why you like Iansan, other than just her design (which is about the only fair metric ppl have so far of her), because her story and lack of VA stinks.",
