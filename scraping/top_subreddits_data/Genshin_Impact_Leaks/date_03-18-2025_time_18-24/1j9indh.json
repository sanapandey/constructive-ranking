ZZZ also just dropped a new patch like yesterday with new story content and 3 new, potentially meta defining characters. \n\nI don\u2019t even play HSR anymore, but they also just had a major patch release a while ago, so that means a ton of new characters and story content for the foreseeable future. \n\nThe VA isssue is also largely an EN thing (with the exception of Ifa\u2019s VA now), so their content is still more or less fully voiced in every other language.",

Aside from allowing you to walk around and interact with the NPCs they don\u2019t offer much else, and are very limited in design. I\u2019d honestly go so far as to say that the amount of map content we got in 5.2 alone is more than anything both those games have produced, combined, in the time since.

Not even related to scandals and such, sometimes contract simply expires and the change is carried out, happened recently in Heaven Burns Red (Akari's VA changed to Suyama Emiri instead of Oono Yuuko and several others).\n\nThe projects are too damn monstrous at this point. When it was just Cygames with their two-three gachas and Kancolle overnight recordings, it was fine. Now we have like two hundred gachas with voice options, running for 6+ years on top of mandatory gacha garbage promotions like Re Zero, To Aru project and Konosuba, on top of radioshows, ads, TV promos, actual anime, etc.\n\nIt stretches available work force and results in an impossible-to-follow schedule.",
