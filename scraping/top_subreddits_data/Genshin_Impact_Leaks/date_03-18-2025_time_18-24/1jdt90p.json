Essentially, it takes place in a (relatively) large portion of the overworld (think like Dragonspine large) and you have 20 minutes to travel around and clear groups of enemies and claim the chests they're guarding. Claiming chests gives you points and buffs.\n\n\nYour main task is to clear the three overworld bosses within the time limit. As time goes on, the enemies get harder so you're pushed to balance accumulating points with killing the final boss before its buffs snowball past yours. Traveling around the overworld with the character/environmental exploration mechanics adds a nice touch to it as well.\u00a0\n\n\nI think Genshin could have something similar and it'd be a step up from its usual combat events. I always kinda wanted more combat trials in the overworld where you can use the environment to your advantage (or detriment)",

That's even more of the case for 3.X units. \n\nHSR's problem is moreso they don't release mid units like Siegwienne at all and chill out for a few patches so the endgame escalation never stops. \n\nI totally get the stress problem tho.

(I can't do auditory only stuff, my brain immediately clicks off).\n\n\nFlashcards while old school, still an excellent option. Make rapidfire quiz game cards with friends. Turn it into memes or terrible jokes. The extra questions in the textbooks, while horribly boring, helps and also 9/10 have the answers in back to check yourself. The simplest of all, taking notes and rereading them.\n\n\nAnd the forbidden tech.... Memorization. Not good to do for more nuanced subjects, as you won't have the actual knowledge to connect the how's and whys of it. (When I took French, the teacher made the mistake of saying the review pamphlet was going to be EXACTLY the same as the test. So my ass memorized 100 answers, since it was a pick four and a true/false test. Went for. 90 to make it look like I didn't basically cheat lol)",

It\u2019s left a lot of people who were caught up going into 5.0 (myself included) with nothing to do 90% of the time except for dailies, events, and Abyss & IT resets.",

Ah, I wonder how much the land has changed since I was last there...\"\n\nMika does not have an 'About Thoma' voiceline, so I will be trying to make one for him as well.  \n  \n\"I haven\u2019t seen Thoma in ages\u2026 He was always so encouraging. Even when I'd get a splinter from climbing a tree or fall and scrape my knees, he never got annoyed. He'd tell me that with enough practice, I'd be a master at exploring. Hm... I am a lot better at traversal compared to then, but there's always room for improvement, right?\"\n\nBeen awhile since I posted one of these! The idea that these two could've known each other before Thoma moved to Inazuma is really cute (though I don't know how timeline accurate it would be). Here's a fun fact too: Thoma's and Mika's least favorite food is alcohol! Both of them have low tolerance for it, so they can't drink any.",

(Idk if I'm spelling that right, also I have never even watched Frieren)\n\nKaveh like bolted over there, then when finding out it was a trick, went \"nooo!\" Because he couldn't watch the frieren\n\nThere was a pokemon trainer there for some reason who was protecting Freminet and Mika from pokemon while they waited for Kaveh\n\nThe meeting spot was by the pond I have outside my house, so Kaveh asked Mika and Freminet \"let me guess, are you going to push me in the water?\"\n\nAnd Mika said \"we wanted to put together a gift to thank you. We know you didn't really get to experience Christmas this year, since you were, you know, protecting us and all\" (idk what he was talking about but apparently Kaveh saved Christmas)\n\nThen Mika continued: \"I'm not sure if the craftsmanship is right, but I did my best\"\n\nAnd Freminet said \"I did some wiring inside to make sure it works correctly\"\n\nAnd Mika handed Kaveh the little Mehrak pendant\n\nAnd Kaveh got all choked up and thanked them\n\nThen they walked away from the water and the pokemon trained walked into the water\n\nAlso the Mehrak pendant was on a silver chain\n\nI remember that very explicitly\n\nThen I woke up\"\n\nAnd that is why I am going to make a Mehrak pendant\n\nFor some reason the part with Nahida was very much so in the format of a Genshin cutscene, reminded me of the Paradise of Providence event where he breaks the crown, even though it was nothing like that it was the same style.. Uh, would Kaveh like Frieren? He really booked it to go see it and he was so devastated when there wasn't any",

There would be more diverse characters, playable older looking people, physiques of all types, males with scruff and beards, not just bishounen archetypes.\n\n More focus on character interactions, therefore hangout quests for every character and more interaction between the cast.\n\nThere would be an even spread of male DPS and female DPS and male supports and female supports, so people don't feel pigeonholed to pull characters that they don't like to support the characters they do. However I strongly believe that characters with lot of relevance to each other in story should be synergistic to each other, so I would revamp combat synergies so that combos like Lyney Lynette Freminet can have a special sibling maneuver like the Pegasus sisters in Fire Emblem.\n\nI would also have respawnable chests on the map to encourage exploration and to give you something to do when you pull a new character.",

Also, it gave the playerbase a whole ton of new teams (Bloom, Hyperbloom, Burgeon, Fridge, Hyperfridge, Hyperburgeon, etc) and gave use to many units who weren't top tier (Kuki, Thoma, Ayato, Kokomi, the main character themselves), so I feel like it had a positive impact in the game.\n\nI think Furina was less impactful horizontally than Dendro, but she still changed the meta. Not only she brought many carries back into the game like Klee, Noelle, etc, she also made some healers more useful (Sayu, Jean, the new Charlotte). It also made building some characters easier since you could slap Marechausse on them. Even if you didn't use her with her new enabled carries, she also slotted in really nicely alongside already strong units (Furina National, Taser Raiden, etc).\n\nI think this is one of the biggest disappointments for me regarding Mavuika. Instead of changing the roster as a whole and possibly breathing new life into older characters, she is entirely closed off and dependant on recent units. Not only that, she is strong enough to warp the game around her where a lot BiS teams become Character/Mavuika/Bennett/Citlali, and we're not even talking about old units, that's the best team for Chasca and Kinich.\n\nAnd I know that weight also rests on Citlali's shoulders, since making melt that easy to access + providing shred is really busted, but that only leaves a sour taste in my mouth since they were released together, something Mihoyo had never done before.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant again, just trying to process how I feel about the game's direction atm.\n\nEdit: fixed the link and some typos",

She really wasn't and still isn't. Furina might be in her best team and give her an artifact set to use, but she didn't bring back anything. Klee can still clear current abyss lineups with her mono pyro team, so long as there aren't pyro elemental shields.\n\nKlee just has an unpopular playstyle. The main thing Furina did for her was give her an option for elemental checks, like Fontaine where you had pyro shields in abyss every two seconds. That about it.\n\nI'd say furina's main value is just making teambuilding different by giving a lot more value to all healers. For instance, Kokomi benefited from Furina as much as she did from dendro, in my opinion.\n\nTo your main point, yeah I'd say Mavuika is extremely disappointing to me for the same reason you pointed out. She's just big numbers and lots of power. She does absolutely nothing interesting for teambuilding or for teams. She's just the second auto win button added to the game, alongside Neuvillette.\n\nCitlali I like because her kit is actually interesting and does cool things for many characters. You can take out Mavuika from the game and Citlali just becomes a very good cool support.",

Yesterday was running lvl 60-69 Dehya/Layla/Candace/Sethos and loving it. ymmv\n\n> how I feel about the game's direction atm.\n\nwhen we started, everything I saw online suggested pulling for Neuv would help with the combat events - in those <AR45 times, I simply didn't have the game knowledge to complete those events otherwise. I'm glad I got him (and Furina, for exploration powercreep) on their reruns to get past that point. \n\nMavuika might end up being the same way for this generation of new players - a strong DPS that helps them clear content at lower levels with little effort/game knowledge, but in the long run just another character/archetype that gets powercrept in the end game meta - countless teams have been out DPS'd over the years. The Mondstadt and Liyue chronicled banners were filled with former top abyss team members\n\nCurrently, I think you're comparing a BiS archetype to a bunch of possible options that weren't top tier in the past - Klee, Noelle, Sayu? Usable, but were they ever BiS? In a more general sense, the \"Mavuika archetype\" is more like a Natlan archetype - they like to be on teams with each other. \n\nfwiw I pulled for Citlali (but not Mavuika) because I wanted a Natlan shielder for my C6 onfield Calamity of Eshu pyro traveler. The other two slots I'm still not sure on, a claymore + maybe hydro, still don't have C6 to test it out.. I guess we all have different priorities lol",

            "body": "I made an account during Navia's debut in 4.3, late December 2023. (I remember this because I remember doing her trial and being baffled by the giant guns coming out while I was still in Mondstadt lol. Seared into my memory... Imagine if i'd joined during Mavuika banner)\n\nI almost immediately (like, within a week or two of starting) took a break, because I found the game hard/overwhelming/frustrating (the gliding challenge and Mondstadt church stealth quest stand out in my memory), during which time I made an ill-advised detour to HSR, a game I stupidly thought would be like Genshin but newer and so less overwhelming. I would eventually realize I spent every day playing HSR wishing it was Genshin instead plus a whole slew of other problems, I joined the game somewhere around 1.6 (my first five star was Blade on his rerun) Jan 2024 and quit extremely permanently some time during 2.2, I think before phase 2 so during May 2024. \n\nI returned to Genshin in time to get Neuvillette on his rerun in April 2024 (spending about a month playing both games before realizing HSR was literally homework I was forcing myself to do while not enjoying any of it and quitting permanently like I said). It took two 80+ pitys because before Natlan I never won a 50/50 or hit pity before 80, I didn't actually realize those things were realistically possible in Genshin before joining this megathread sometime around Emilie's banner, I assumed they were just made up like other marketing lies (later I'd understand it would be illegal to do that and I'm just very unlucky, but at the time I was blissfully ignorant, and to this day I don't really understand people on this megathread who assume good luck is normal/expect it/actively complain if they need to lose a 50/50 and go to soft pity to get a character, because I spent months thinking every character costing 160+ wishes was just norma)\n\nGetting Neuvillette transformed the game for me from white-knuckling with effort through everything to an easy comfortable game to play. We can powercreep discourse the night and day away about him, but in the months before I reattempted abyss he transformed my experience of the game and while he is blorbo shaped in other ways, it was actually ages before I met him in game, I loved him before then because he saved my skills issues ass.\n\nNow, almost a year after getting him, I know the game mechanics well enough to miss the early days where the game is hard and kind of want to re-experience it again, this time without the hugely negative experience of being a genuinely new player who can't access anything (events etc) because they're AR locked, not yet used to the controls, and literally cannot progress further in the story. (By the time i rejoined genshin I had at least been thoroughly trained by HSR to understand gacha bullshit and how gacha characters are built aka more gacha bullshit, when I was new to Genshin I understood literally none of that, a game with 275 different currencies and RNG based character building was completely new to me I'd only played normal RPGs before then) \n\nWhen it comes to QoL changes Hoyo has made to the game for newbie players like nerfing difficulty, adding time to the flight challenge time limit, or adding a quest to tell players how to get to Liyue without going through dragonspine, I am the example new player they are losing without those changes. (I actually really wish instead of frontloading a lot of challenging/interesting game mechanics content in early game there would be some challenges in later AQs, but I guess because they now want new players to be able to skip to later AQ that will never happen). But I'm very glad I came back to the game I actually wanted to play, because once I got the hang of it I've enjoyed it ever since (except during the eternal Rosaria banner, which was a real low point).\n\nWill I still be around by late Nod Krai idk. Guess we'll find out! Either way this game got me through a real bad patch in my life with a truly absorbing and beautiful world it was easy to lose myself in so I'm grateful to it and don't resent the money I've spent even if I'm not sure I'll keep playing (I resent every single cent I spent in HSR but oh well it was a learning experience and it's made me more cautious with Genshin in case HSR is their plan for Genshin's future)",

Basically my thought is that while it's true that huge swathes of Genshin players just play the game and don't click on any auxilliary tools like Hoyolab or YShelper or [Paimon.moe](http://Paimon.moe) or Enka whatsoever, there is a strong enough correlation between the kind of player who would be part of these stats, and the kind of player who would be looking at content or participating in discussions that evaluate limited 5\\*. So in that sense, it's still a relatively germane point: it's very possible that the average Neuvilette/Furina *belonging to a person reading this comment* has constellations!\n\nIt basically just means that in discussions that assume C0 everyone, some additional detail/context can be added to account for the very high constellation ownership rate. Which I think generally has no downside anyway. For example, recent Varesa team discussions have often pointed out that overload is her best team at all C0, but if you have vertical investment on Furina or Xianyun, then her taser plunge team pulls ahead.",

Any survey you take from a place frequented by meta players and among those meta players only take the data from the ones who care enough about meta to actually contribute, will not be reliable data to represent the average. \n\nWhen the source is flawed to begin with, the sample size is irrelevant. \n\n>The issue with this is that while YShelper's data might be flawed, it's better than nothing.\n\nI disagree. Taking no action is better than taking action based on very unlikely to be correct data. \n\nIf I visit some cultist group and they unanimously say in a survey that Cthulu will emerge from the ground unless a sacrifice is made, it's not better to take action. Even if there's no sources saying otherwise. \n\nOf course that is a silly extreme example, but it gets the point across. Flawed data is flawed data. Drawing conclusions from that is not ever a good idea.",

Price always refers to transactional value (not necessarily monetary, but there has to be some form of currency involved). You assign a price to something. \n\nWhile you can ask \"how much is that worth?\" (in which case you are talking about transactional value) worth can also have the meaning of value based on that entity's inherent qualities or usefulness.\n\nTo illustrate: let's say you want to buy access to Skirk's beta kit. The price tag says that it's \u00a31500. However, if you don't care about Skirk, it likely isn't *worth* \u00a31500 to you because you aren't interested in it. So its value is lower than what the price says.\n\nYou'd therefore rate it as worthless (useless), whereas someone that is desperate for Skirk leaks would do anything to find out what her kit is and might be willing to pay even more than what the price tag says (\u00a31500) if that means they get access to it before anyone else. To them, it's priceless.\n\nIt just boils down to whether you love Skirk or not.",

Snezhnaya delaying doesn't mean I'm getting less, so I'm fine with it\n\n**Beta delay** if considering beta same way as \"allowing you to see what character is next\" - I already answered in first one. Though beta is my \"content\". I'm spending a lot of time here, so it is my entertainment,  so delaying will just add a bit more dry time. Nothing that serious.\n\n**Your fav rerun delay** my favs are always pulled on their first banner. I didn't have problems with it yet, so I didn't experience it for myself.

Mavuika has a very fixed rotation of buff-buff-buff-nuke-combos, and if you fuck up the rotation you get penalized by massive losses in DPS (things like setting everything up, pressing the burst, and just then the boss goes into its invulnerability stage). She has several combos of varying levels of difficulty that maximize her damage, from the lowest (just hold the button) to the highest (I believe it's currently a tryhard sucrose combo but I'm not certain). Those let her continually push the DPS ceiling she broke even higher, so she's now something like 50k DPS ahead of the next best. But her easiest combo is still the strongest DPS in the game. (Assuming you land the nuke)\n3. They're all reasonably f2p friendly but Mavuika is the least.\n4. Matter of opinion",

I had to actually look it up online, since I had never seen the name Natlan ever mentioned in-game (I missed that NPC dialogue there).\n\nAnd Natlan wasn't mentioned in the Archon Quest until Sumeru Act II if I recall correctly. It was in the first playthrough of the Sabzeruz Festival, where someone (Dunyarzad, I think) mentions that vegetables are prominent in the feast because it's the Dendro Archon's celebration, and in response, Paimon comments that, in that case, the Pyro Archon's celebration would probably have lots of meat, followed by (approximately) \"Traveler, we need to go to **Natlan** right away!\"",

            "body": "I just don't like the whiplash and inconsistency. If they spent several regions thematically building Traveler as an observer undoing all of that doesn't make the Traveler feel better... it makes them feel worse.\n\n I wish they'd at least made the traveler more powerful and important USING the observer role. We did get that in Lantern Rite at least where the traveler's power WAS that they're an outsider. Natlan just kind of felt like generic bullshit MC with no explanation or grounding just \"they're important because we said so\".\n\nBut like. In general. The traveler's writing is very, very shitty and makes the traveler immensely unlikable and it's because they can't decide on a direction so they change personalities every region and it makes them come across as inconsistent and annoying. Like be kind and generous and empathetic or be jaded and guarded and focused on your own business \u2014 either one is fine, truly, either one could make a good character I'd like. But what **doesn't** make a character I can like is switching back and forth between those modes so arbitrarily that it stops feeling like you have any personality at all except \"whatever is convenient for the writer of the plot at this specific moment\". \n\nAnd of course all of this is made a thousand times worse by two things:\n\n1. In practice, power-wise, in gameplay the traveler sucks. The little scene where they show off to kachina how they can control multiple elements? Yeah that scene sucked because meanwhile you, the player, are like \"actually they can't control two elements at a time ever\". It's laughable how their solution to this is \"give traveler powers that are genuinely cool \u2014 limited to one domain only\". \n2. The traveler is never, ever, ever allowed to be changed by their experiences in any way, and this means they never gain useful experience. Like holy shit why can't you let the part where they've traveled the world and met the most powerful people of every nation have ANY relevance? That would be such an easy way to make camera MC a useful important role. But instead the Traveler is consistently incurious, passive, and inert. Nothing that happens to them ever matters. If it could potentially matter \u2014 they forget it. No amount of throwing in a cutscene of them holding hands with Mavuika to defeat the random abyss shapeshifter can undo that.\n\nI mean god the writing can't even be consistent about how to treat the traveler's age. It would be so cool how the traveler is old enough to have seen stars die but then in-game they're treated like a kid, or a young adult, or an immortal 100% according to the needs of the scene. Not just by other people which you could justify by saying some people know traveler is old and some don't, but the actual writing itself just seems to constantly forget how old traveler should be... \n\nLike I can only pity people who want to write in character canon compliant lore accurate traveler fic because who the fuck would that person even be.\n\nEdit 1: (I wrote this entire rant, then was about to mention how another \"character\" treated this way is saurians and their wildly inconsistent intelligence, and then remembered the absolutely shit awful writing around traveler's indwelling ability oh my god it's yet another example of them being too lazy to actually make some kind of decision about who and what the traveler is so it's literally quest by quest a different reality what is happening whether it's special or not, how other people perceive it, etc. Saurian indwelling writing issues is the inconsistency of traveler as reductio ad absurdum because it's present in a single patch update even in one six week span of content they couldn't actually decide how to write the traveler consistently. GAAAAAAH.)\n\nEdit 2: I will say one positive thing. This business where they're bringing back the traveler abyssal cleansing powers? That's a step in the right direction. That's \"oh right we have an MC they should have something useful to offer\" done right. First of all because it WAS foreshadowed (before they forgot about it for years) so it doesn't feel like a complete ass-pull. Secondly because it actually ties into traveler's backstory/lore. Thirdly because \u2014 it seems like they're trying as of Natlan to be consistent with it? They've now brought it up in Natlan, Liyue event, and Inazuma event. I am genuinely optimistic that they've decided this is something they can use as a consistent point in the future for why traveler can be useful and important. So that's definitely a good step in the right direction and if they could just fix literally everything else about traveler's writing too that would be cool. (Like let's see if our annual Dainsleif quest at least has actual ramifications for once.)",

Plus neither of them had the kind of World quest lines that dragonspine and later regions would have. \n\nArchon quests were not very strong . Mond was decent and Liyue was a slog 70% of the time and only peaked in the 1.1 continuation. Also if i had picked EN (which I likely would have) i would had to deal with the SQUEAKY paimon voice\n\nAnd Personally i think The game Music got so much better from Inazuma and Onwards. 1.0 Music was alright for the most part so that\u2019s already a big part of the game\u2019s charm as I know it now completely missing. \n\nA lot of QoLs and features from 2.0 and beyond were missing at the time (Weapon banners were a big no no, 120 resin, Some events being especially hard like the food delivery one, no serenitea pot, no waverider etc.) though i doubt these would have hurt my experience as much",

Wait, I need to get this a bit better.) \n\nAnemo: Dvalin (1/3), Scaramouche (1/3) --> 2/3\n\nGeo: Andrius (1/3), Azdaha (1/3) --> 2/3\n\nDendro: Apep (1) -->1\n\nPyro: Andrius (1/3), Azdaha (1/6), Signora (1/2), Knave (1), Gosoythoth (1) --> 3\n\nElectro: Dvalin (1/3), Childe (1/3), Azdaha (1/6), Raiden (1), Scaramouche (1/3) --> 2 1/6\n\nHydro: Dvalin (1/3), Childe (1/3), Azdaha (1/6), Scaramouche (1/3), Narwhal (1) --> 2 1/6\n\nCryo: Andrius (1/3), Childe (1/3), Azdaha (1/6), Signora (1/2) --> 1 1/3\n\nNow you might say \"geo is just as bad off\" but I've had to buy dust of azoth so many times. I just want a new shiny weekly boss to have a 100% chance of dropping the anemo gems I so sorely need and that's my only plead for why there must be a 2nd weekly boss in Natlan. Please. Weekly boss in Mare Jivari that stole all the wind. I need my anemo gems. ;------; so many world bosses of my anemo characters dropped geo gems I've got enough of those. I need anemo gems. \n\nAlso, from Raiden - Narwhal, 10 characters used their materials, so I'm guessing the same will go with Knave (missing 2 as of 5.5) and Gosoythoth (missing 7 as of 5.5). Dvalin and Andrius have 11 1/3 and 11 2/3 respectively, and Childe, Azdaha, and Signora have 9 characters using their materials. So... that's 3 spots to get to 10 for those too x.x\n\nBUT PLEASE I NEED MY ANEMO GEMS",

You start seeing the design patterns, nothing can surprise you anymore. Flaws that you may overlook in games with a reasonable playtime become hard to overlook when you're exposed to them for hundreds, thousands of hours. The sense of wonder gets overpowered by the neverending tedium of being expected to do the same things thousands of times.   \n  \nMost games that people can play for so long have a built in replayability component, like the unpredictability of multiplayer matches, randomization, constantly starting fresh, being able to create something with a high degree of freedom.  \nGenshin does NOT do well in any of those aspects, and due to its nature pretty much never can.",

People are overvaluing the QoLs of other games like WuWa but in the process forget about core aspects like story and gameplay, they just play because 'oh but they got better stuff!'.\n\nDon't get me wrong, they are good, but I think sometimes we place too much importance on them when we need to also care for lore or gameplay. If I can't get myself to care for these aspects, then QoL will not bring me over, for example. That's why I no longer play WuWa even though they have better QoL, because I did not like their direction and feel like they kind of 'lack' vision, while Genshin has quite a lot of vision and passion, even long term, such as the mail from Jean's birthday.\n\nI think it's going to fall off truly when people start realizing that QoL isn't everything, it has to be a good gameplay and story that will tide you over, not just simping for QoL.\n\nGranted though, Twitter is Twitter, they will always whine like miserable creatures, best to ignore them. Lately though Youtube has been a little more miserable too. Hope the rest don't follow suit... it's sad to see people being happy about the 'downfall' of Genshin because I really didn't think it went THAT downhill imo.

I think they'll only rerun 2 or 3 of them and let the rest of them wait for chronicled, Kazuha obviously getting a rerun so they can say he reran not too long ago so he won't be in chronicled, Kokomi would reach Shenhe level of rerun jail if she doesn't rerun until 5.6 (Shenhe was 3.5 all the way to 5.3) and they even acknowledged that the Shenhe case was crazy so it's unlikely they'll do it again, or atleast not too much worse. Then the last one i think will either be Ayaka or Miko. Meaning Yoi, Ayato and Itto are the most likely to wait for chronicled for a rerun imo\n\nSo i'm thinking\n\n5.6 1 Natlan character rerun, maybe Emilie and Kokomi, and whoever the new 5 star is, probably chef girl\n\n5.7 2 Natlan character reruns, 1 Inazuma character rerun other than Kazuha and the new 5 star, probably Skirk\n\n5.8 1 Natlan character rerun, 2 Inazuma or Sumeru rerun, and the new 5 star probably Dahlia with a Monstadt chronicled\n\n6.0 2 Snezhnaya/NodKrai 5 stars, Kazuha, and most likely an archon to start the marathon again.\n\n6.1 1 Snezhnaya/Nodkrai 5 star, 1 Natlan rerun, 1 Fontaine rerun, plus an archon maybe Ei\n\n6.2 1 Snezhnaya/Nodkrai 5 star, 1 Natlan rerun, 1 Sumeru rerun, an archon, and an Inazuma chronicled with everyone other than Ei, Kazuha and maybe whoever reran in 5.8.\n\nAnd then Liyue chronicled in 6.5 and Monstadt chronicled in 6.8.",

So far in natlan, characters from natlan seem to be focused on Phase 1, almost as if saying to us players \"hey new shiny exploration character to explore the new region\". If 5.6 has a new region, I'd wager it makes sense for Ifa to be in Phase 1 simply because he has good exploration (flight if similar to Qucusaur which it should be). Which makes Phase 2 the \"combat\" focused character, and a meta dps character seems to be the play here. Plus 5.6 is looking to be a big patch so 3 characters doesn't seem out of the ordinary (so 4 star Effie with Skirk as Phase 2?). Ifa is second on the list of 5.6 characters, so unless they did a swap which implies a character got changed from their original plan (Kirara Geo -> Dendro, Sigewinne 4 star -> 5 star), I don't see them making Ifa a 4 star.  \nThey could just make him a standalone phase 2 4 or 5 star lmao, im just rambling my own thought process.

            "body": "This is a LONG comment. Collapse unless you wanna read.\n\nNow, I usually just lurk in this here megathread, but I have SO many thoughts and opinions on Natlan's archon quest I can't contain them anymore and this seems like an alright place to scream about it. It is oviously mostly related to act 5. Keep in mind all of the following points are *negative* (even though there definitely are good points, especially in the acts 1-4)\n\nFirst and foremost. Mavuika is a great character, even if she's not my cup of tea; but girl, whatcha doing here? She doesn't belong in the archon quest. We're told that in Natlan \"No one fights alone\" so tell me, why is Mavuika an excpetion? Sure there are the six heroes and they need to gather, but it's presented as if the only reason for that was to start the ode of resurrection. Don't get me wrong, she can be super powerful physically and mentally, but even showing her struggling would go a long way to solvong this issue. Maybe she gets hurt pretty badly against Gosoythoth, or in the scene afterwards we get Mavuika's PoV where she's filled with anxiety and/or depression. Maybe she gets struck by grief and anger and becomes reckless. Show us that not even the strongest can fight alone.\n\nSecondly, the fact that the abyss didn't turn into the people who were lost to previous battles with the abyss is such a missed opportunity. We're told that the abyss is cunning and we can clearly see that it can shapeshift to at least anything in the night kingdom, maybe even beyond, soo why not show us how the people of Natlan would react if they had to fight their deceased loved ones? Also, wasn't booting up the ode of resurrection and turning the tide enough of a conclusion without blasting a hole in the sky? Would it kill you to just keep the stadium of sacred flame under siege until the end of act 5? (I know that it wouldn't really gel with exploration, but there are ways around that)\n\nThirdly, the traveler doesn't accomplish anything of substance. I guess there's the war, and I can give you that, but everything else you can just day never happened and the story would play out exactly the same with minor if not zero rewrites. And then they get a celebration and are being parised as the biggest hero for doing absolutely nothing? Shouldn't that be Mavuika considering she did basically everything on her own? Even in the final battle in the night kingdom all traveler does is summon a sword and that's it, not that that was needed as per my first problem.\n\nMy fourth problem is that there's no emotional depth in act 5. We meet lots of now dead people, yet all they have to say is \"you can do it, traveler, I belive in you!\"? I did admittedly skim through all of the night kingdom text cause I just wanted to be done with this trainwreck; but I think I would've remembered if there was actual serious conversation in there. This is not that big of a problem, I admit, but on top of everything else it just annoys me.\n\nI get that Natlan's story as a whole isn't for me, but I just can't help but feel that it is the only finale that landed on its head when the others managed to land on their feet. Not always gracefully, Inazuma got a broken ankle, but at least it didn't destroy the entire archon quest in my opinion. Natlan's finale just kinda soured the entire region as a whole, and that along with a lot of other questionable decisions during 5.x just rubs me the wrong way and makes me feel less welcome in Genshin. Even though I won't stop playing yet, it still sucks; because in many ways it was and still is a perfect game for me. Here's to hoping they'll bring it back during the latter half of 5.x and later during 6.x.\n\nThank you for reading my wall of text, maybe I'll comment more often with more thoughts about Genshin's story/writing or maybe just shitposts. No promises, though",

We cannot compromise the integrity of the Gunbrella license system, and as such, we must take swift action to rectify this error.  \n  \n\ud83d\udc65 COMMUNITY DISCUSSION:  \n  \nWe invite our community members to engage in a respectful and constructive discussion about this decision. Your input is valuable to us as we continually strive to uphold the safety and well-being of Melusine.  \n  \n\ud83c\udf10 SOCIAL MEDIA RESPONSES:  \n  \nUser1: This is a shocking revelation!

I think you could still make the Space Whale being a pet work if you NEVER see Surtarlogi on screen, and it's all intended to gesture at vauge machinations taking place way above your head. Something like Marathon or Dark Souls where the lore is there but you have to look for it and it isn\u2019t needed to enjoy the story.

Cherubim are regarded in traditional Christian angelology as angels of the second highest order of the ninefold celestial hierarchy. De Coelesti Hierarchia (c. 5th century) lists them alongside Seraphim and Thrones. According to Thomas Aquinas, the cherubim are characterized by knowledge, in contrast to seraphim, who are characterized by their \"burning love to God\"",

And when one so gifted completed their duty... the gift the gods would receive in return would be more abundant still.\n\n> Neuvillette obeys no edict from the heavens, but he does acknowledge human will. So he too set aside parts of himself, as like unto the dragon-treasure hoards of old, awaiting valiant humans to come and claim them.\n\nThe \"Though they might know nothing of who or what wish had stepped into the threshold of the sacred\" part indicates that it may be a subconscious kinda deal",

Because of how short her E duration is, playing teams with >16s rotation length tanks your overall DPS because with how short her E is relative to its cooldown, you don't really have a way to fill dead time that's added in longer rotations, and lose a lot of effective DPS. Clorinde's E only lasting 7.5s means you want her rotations to be as short as possible so that as soon as her E is over, you can immediately start your next rotation--she doesn't have any abilities that let her fill DPS into extra time added by characters with longer cooldowns. Even if teams with longer rotations add enough DPS to make up for the dead time exist, those teams FEEL worse to play BECAUSE of the dead time.\n\nThis is why Clorinde Overload needed Mavuika--Xiangling and Thoma are both 20s rotation characters, and having 4s of extra dead time in your rotation for your off-field Pyro applier just felt awful.",

In this way, I guess you could justify her having higher multipliers since she cannot make use of reactions.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, I kind of want skirk to work similarly to navia?

In my mind I only did that for meta, which is ew because I prefer to do that for pookies.\n\nExcept I do actually really like him. His EN VA is *amazing*, and as soon as I met him in the story I was immediately charmed. 10/10 personality, and a lot more nuanced than I'd excepted him to be. He's so lovely. (And I even like his playstyle. Sure, it's a bit boring but him using the big Pokemon style power washer is hilarious.)\n\nBut he's also so involved in meta discussions as a \"must have\" unit and blah blah and he's just so oversaturated that my brain keeps forgetting Iike him and believes I only have him out of necessity. (Xianyun suffers similarly. She hasn't left my overworld team since her release so I'm tired when I see her, and only the Anecdotes reminded me that she's actually best bird mum and I adore her.)\n\nI don't really know what to do with this realisation. It isn't the first time I have it. Maybe it'll get better when eh is out of the meta more, or maybe I need to build a few silly teams with him that feel like fun and not efficiency. Still, it's odd to me that character can suffer from success so much that it impedes my enjoyment of them. I guess fatigue is a real thing, even though I rarely play him now.",

I overestimated how much I'd enjoy dragonhop, in practice I basically never use it over Chasca + Xilonen because it feels so bad everywhere but huge open spaces. I also overestimated how much I'd use her sub-dps capabilities\u2014 me barely using Xiangling should have been a warning sign, but I find her more annoying gameplay wise than Xiangling because it's so easy to accidentally end up in her motorcycle state. Also I thought shed be good at mining and an exploration team mainstay as a result because she's a claymore but god she sucks at mining... Possibly one of the worst mining claymores in the game. \n\n I got to play her optimal gameplay a LOT in the \"did you pull Mavuika namecard\" event and it really reinforced to me that I hate how it plays and how it feels. I'm honestly still kind of praying she gets some character development so I at least like her more as a character but overall I pulled her because she was my first chance to pull an archon on debut and I *already* regret it so I'm probably gonna regret it even more once she's been Raiden'd into irrelevance. At least getting her made me change my mind about getting Citlali though. Love Citlali. And hey I ended up with a really good build for her entirely by accident while trying (still trying) to get Chasca a better build and at least I'll get something like three months at least of her being meta which is better than pulling someone you regret after they've already faded from the meta or were never truly meta to begin with, because that feeling truly sucks. (...HSR is where I know it from). And her halo looks genuinely cool, I do enjoy her afk with Furina in overworld occasionally.  But yeah anytime I think about Mavuika I have to scramble for reasons why getting her wasn't a mistake. Because actually. It was. \n\nAnd then there's Shenhe who doesn't count because she was a 50/50 loss, and Baizhu who counts because even though I love him I regret everything about the experience of pulling for him (stupid stupid stupid). It's not like I needed him or anything, and I spent too much fucking money on that scam banner.\n\nSo uh yeah. 5.3 was. A terrible time full of terrible pulling decisions and extremely miserable pulling experiences all around. I would erase it from my genshin history if I could.  I comfort myself by telling myself I need to occasionally make really dumb decisions as part of the experience of being human and that this one wasn't really so bad all things considered.\n\nAnd it's kind of crazy that ALL my pulling regrets are so concentrated into that one extremely recent patch after a year of playing. I'm still not sure what was up with that. (Honestly? I think it might literally have been me needing to make a stupid decision lol. Does anyone else get a periodic need every so often to do something stupid because otherwise life is too oppressively full of only doing the smart right correct thing? Because I do. Last time it was getting bangs (they look terrible on me in general AND I did it myself at home) and I guess this time it was Genshin pulls.)",

People who say that they find Pantalone an interesting character are saying that the current bits of info about him are painting an interesting concept. And you could say that based on current information, you don't find Pantalone interesting. That is totally fair. But \"boring\" implies different things, it's a judgment of a whole character that we don't really know.\n\nFor example, I can say that Alice isn't interesting to me. I don't find the cliche of \"super powerful but kinda crazy witch\" very intriguing and I don't like some of her actions that were described in the books. I don't like the concept of Alice so far. But I can't and won't say that she's boring even if I find her trope boring because I can't access her whole character so what do I know about her to call her boring.\n\n>>We know what he looks like, we know what his personality is, we know his motivations and his personal goals\n\nWe literally don't. We know he has glasses and long dark hair. We don't even know what his eye color is, or what his outfit looks like because he was in a coat. \n\nHis personality? Really? Based on 3 voicelines?

Do I sit here pretending that \"fallen angel Columbina\" is less intriguing than \"banker Pantalone\"? No, I don't. Same with Sandrone, she has her robots, it's more interesting than tax fraud. But again, interesting =/ boring. \n\nWe can have the same discussion later, when (if) he gets released and his only gimmick is talking about money, his voicelines about money and his profile stories about how cool he is and how much money he has. Then yeah, sure, he is a boring character. But making a judgment on how boring he is using 3 voicelines and a couple of notes is insane work to me",

If I had to illustrate how I feel about him, well, there's this lack of excitement, little to no interest in him, those are just different ways to say idgaf.   \n  \nI don't particularly care (neutral) for Alice either, but talking about Alice vs talking about Pantalone illicit two different reactions with me. I have some level of anticipation for Alice but any discussion about Pantalone presented to me on a critical level makes me wanna excuse myself because well, I don't really care that much either (leaning on negative). I don't know how else you want me to illustrate that I find him boring as a concept of a character without actually saying he's boring.\n\n>We literally don't. We know he has glasses and long dark hair.

That can also be unreliable since we also had \"no insane bone in her body\" Arlecchino?\n\nCashflow Supervision? Pale Flame? Citlali Tribal Chronicle mini-cameo? Unlike other people, I never once had the idea that Arlecchino was meant to be exactly how the other Harbringers talked about her. Everyone's an unreliable narrator to a degree, except weapon and artifact lore. I'm guessing he's a cynical businessman who keeps things polite and professional on the surface with a hidden agenda, you know the type. He could very much be another iteration of Aventurine with a Genshin twist of being too comically evil or too watered down and I'm already expecting either route. \n\nMaybe has an inferiority complex, kinda bitter, rather salty, careful with his words, very guarded. The Harbringers are kinda \"first impression is the last one\" so I'm sure they won't deviate from how he's initially presented. Even Arlecchino maintained her \"I hate you capitalistic scheming losers, I love my children\" vibe from Lazzo.\n\n>\u00a0But making a judgment on how boring he is using 3 voicelines and a couple of notes is insane work to me\n\nCall it intuition. We know how this game writes its characters, and with 3 years of experience under my belt I can safely make semi-accurate guesses. I used to fight with people for saying Arlecchino is actually crazy, insane, sadistic and psychopathic and secretly doesn't care about her children and look how that turned out! She actually has depth and I was right.   \n  \nI have some expectations for him and they can make him more likable to me through dialogue or presentation. If they surpass those expectations and blow my mind then yeah, he'll be more interesting to me by then since it's okay the change your mind when presented with new information. The worst thing that could happen is that they could always make him Tall Male Dori instead of Ningguang's Foil character wise.\n\nBut as he is right now compared to his peers?

You sounded at the very least weird when you said Pantalone is boring, as if we're talking about a fully fleshed character who was released with a full info package and not a dude who was mentioned a couple times in notes.\n\n>Be serious, knowing his eye color and outfit won't make him more interesting to me.\n\nWho knows. I mean, my interest in Arlecchino peaked significantly when I saw her full design instead of the head in a coat that looked like \"evil Eula\". \n\n(And I wouldn't be so dismissive of his eyes, who know, maybe he's another Khaenriah in disguise /s)\n\n>Cashflow Supervision? Pale Flame? Citlali Tribal Chronicle mini-cameo?\n\nAnd how does that relate to personality? Motivation and goals sure, that's why I didn't mention them in my reply. His personality? Not really. The only personality traits that we can deduce right now is that he's a yapper and probably throws chairs in anger when he's alone.

I'm sure the people who'd defend Alice from getting called boring by you that are just disagreeing aren't gonna argue with you the same way as you're illustrating it. It's not necessarily a \"bad argument\" just an opinion formulated around sparse information, not an immediate conclusion. I've been on Tumblr, Twitter, Fanpop, Amino etc, I've had my fair share of discourse.\n\nArlecchino's design may prop her up a few points but male designs by HYV tend to get less...ambitious to say the least. He's wearing a black turtleneck, slacks and leather shoes. He's a business man? Florals for spring? Groundbreaking.\n\n>And how does that relate to personality?\n\nI mean, with some level of inference and experience with character tropes like you can presume the kind of personality he'll have even just from the weapons and artifacts and mentions. Cynicism against a higher power, slimy politician dripping in cool confidence, doing everything he does out of spite and vengeance. Maybe he's the real Evil Eula we're talking about omg.\n\nWe've seen it before, it's not particularly hard to connect the dots. I'm pretty sure the \"heartless businessmen\" line was direct shade towards him. He made a sarcastic protest towards the \"half a day\" decree by Pulchinella, he even said it with a SMILE. Like you can tell that man doesn't really give a fuck about Signora dying as a person. He's funding whatever Dottore's doing, that man is twisted to say the least.\n\n>And his dislike of Morax will 100% retconned because no way a character that we're meant to take seriously will be allowed to criticize the actions of Fantasy China's god\n\nIf anything, it's probably gonna be one of his main personality traits.

To keep the Ode of resurrection and sacred flame running (no pyro archon= no revives,no night warden wars to sustain the flame and limit abyssal invasion/portals that can pop up anywhere so you can\u2019t even build defenses you have to rely on the sacred flame)\n2. To keep the peace between the tribes and we see that when >!mavuika left the first time even after the elders warned her not to and when she left the tribes were about to start a civil war!<\n3. To be the primary defender.\n\n\nMavuika is a prodigy and the strongest natlan archon in history and has the memories of ALL the past pyro archons(also prodigies) which people seem to forget\n\nAnd at the end of the day mavuika is just a human playing on an equal field with the rest of the gods which we know is a monumental task and requires suppression of emotions \n\nSo yeah I expect her and all other pyro archons to be glazed to the high heavens\n\nIf anybody wants to discuss I am open",

The most egregious example is in her character story, about how she's good at literally everything and better than everyone else at all those things because of how good she is at everything. Her story quest featuring the first pyro archon declaring she's the best pyro archon ever is another example. Releasing an entire event with a custom namecard tailor-made to buff her, her, and only her is a third example. \n\nLike I am totally fine with Mualani going on for paragraphs about how amazing Mavuika is, that's not exactly any different from a Teyvat theological perspective than Sara and her obsession with Raiden. But there's a big difference between a character doing that in a context that makes sense, and the narrative itself going on and on and on and on about how Mavuika the human archon is the most flawless most perfect strongest best most unbelievably good at everything has never hesitated has never had a single human emotion is just perfect at all times in all ways could never make a mistake could only be awesome day in and day out archon to ever exist. \n\n...like if a character did that it would just be funny and nbd, honestly. I'd be fine if there was just a character named Glazer Wei from the Way of Glaze and any time he appeared on screen it was to spew four straight paragraphs about Mavuika being the most perfect being to ever exist.  It's a LOT more obnoxious when it's just the description of Mavuika in \"about Mavuika\"",

Neg about the writing of Mavuika but not really her as a character directly:\n\n>!I think that Mavuika being the 'human archon', and the theming of \"humans are strong because the humans before them laid the path for them\" that is brought up in her own story quest fundamentally runs counter to her being the strongest archon and from 500 years ago, because it raises the question: so, why couldn't the pyro archons who came after her have dealt with the abyss issue? We know they must exist because Kachina tells us about how archon succession works in Natlan in a way that implies there has been a parade of them between Mavuika sacrificing herself to the flame and her return, but they're just absent entirely, in person and in lore presence.!<\n\n>!By the logic the story presents, they should've been stronger than her by learning from her rule, and all those who came after her. If Mavuika is a prodigy among prodigies, and that's why it had to be her, her own story's meaning is hamstrung. The writing going out of its way to repeat how amazing she is would not bother me in other circumstances, but it does with her because it highlights what in my opinion is a writing fumble.!<\n\n>!I don't really have a big issue with her as a character, but I find the writing around her very questionable because of this. It feels like they want to have their cake and eat it too on the concept of a human archon; I personally would've found it much more tolerable if she either simply was a 500 year old god like most of the others, or if she was actually born \\~25 years ago and, as the last in a long line of Archons, had the knowledge of actually all of them, instead of the story implying that the last few hundred years of them didn't measure up!<",

Yes, the writers gave her one of the best outcome possible, which is as idealistic as it gets and it lines up with her goal, however, the writers also showed how helpless and ignorant Mavuika is and how many things **beyond her control** had to work out just right for her ideal to work. Mavuika could\u2019ve returned 500 years later to a destroyed Natlan, with nothing left to save, but thankfully she didn\u2019t have to face that (on another note: it shows that Mavuika\u2019s presence, or lack thereof, is not as bad as you suggest compared to other nations but I\u2019ll come back to this later). \n\nShe didn\u2019t know whether crafting Ancient Name for Traveler is possible at all, nor does she have any idea how to begin to make that work (other than ask Xilonen). She had no idea when the 6 heroes will awaken, or if all of them will awaken at all. She had no idea how many more people will die while she awaits the awakening of the 6 heroes. She had no idea how to save the lost souls who escaped the weakened leylines, leaving them to disappear into nothingness. She also had no idea that there is a better contingency plan than gnosis by waking up Lord of Night with Secret Source Mechanism. She had no idea how Natlan will ever sustain Lord of Night without Pilgrimage of Sacred Flame, but she basically went \u201cOk, I\u2019ll give up my life to sustain it for 200-300 years and hope that future Archon will figure something out\u201d.\n\nCapitano did a lot of work for Natlan and Mavuika to make her plan work. From researching alternatives to gnosis, holding back Abyss using canonically one of the mightiest army in Teyvat (ie. Fatui) to significantly reduce casualties and buy Mavuika a lot more time, storing lost souls in his heart at his own expense to keep them from disappearing, and finally a permanent solution to sustaining Lord of Night (and her rules) without the need for Pilgrimage. \n\n2. Dependency on Archon. When Ei went away to save Makoto during Cataclysm, Inazuma was very nearly destroyed, and would have if not for Makoto getting Istaroth\u2019s help to buy Ei time until she returned and protected Inazuma. Natlan survived 500 years without Mavuika, Inazuma didn\u2019t without their Archons. Granted Natlan had Ronova\u2019s rules and Lord of Night. Also, to that point, the Sacred Flame and Ode of Resurrection operates on Ronova\u2019s rules and are fueled by the Pilgrimage. They don\u2019t rely on the Pyro Archon. \n\n3. Mavuika is not confirmed to be the strongest Natlan Archon in history. Yes, she defeated Xbalanque, but that was a battle of **willpower**.\n\nMavuika had to make hard choices, and have great capabilities to back them up to some extent, but let\u2019s not pretend that she was written to be perfect. Imo she has just the right amount of glazing, though I would have preferred a less \u201cconvenient\u201d outcome for Natlan where everything works out.",

Or Wriothesley and Neuvillette having a moment during Sigewinnes SQ fishing and joking about swimming feels natural, because they're just background characters having a moment to themselves.\n\nWhen it gets too heavy handed, that's when it starts to feel more corporate bait for me, Ive felt that agenda about ships between characters and also recently about Traveller shipbait as well.",

PS: gaming keeps failing at going up the pillar 3 times in a row, i think you need to not input moving forward when in air with him, and face right at the pillar so he doesnt slant sideways when hes ascended, and also find the side of the pillar with a tiny slope near the top to go up to) i hate this 60% res xilonen citllali propaganda boss aaaaaaa",
