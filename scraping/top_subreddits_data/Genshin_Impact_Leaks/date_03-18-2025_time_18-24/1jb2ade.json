Kachina can compete with some old 5\\* maybe, but not with recent ones. Nad one look at Ifa shows he is up to snuff to 4.0+ 5\\* standard (as far as I remember GI got graphics engine upgrade in Fontaine).",

She looks like a modern kawaii girl. I\u2019d say she\u2019s the worst example but many characters just look kind of modern street style with geometric motifs, which isn\u2019t an inherently bad approach but utilizing more obvious cultural elements from whatever inspiration they used would really help the designs feel more Genshin, imo. Bc that\u2019s what they\u2019ve always done and I genuinely dont see a good reason to break this with Natlan\n\nBtw by Native American I do include Mesoamerica and Indigenous South America, not just North Americans.

Only Enkanomiya really had sun motifs before Mavuika (and it was an artificial sun). Other pyros barely mention the sun either (I can only think of Diluc\u2019s \u201cDawn\u201d imagery). So the sun motif just screams out to me here.\n\nFor Kinich, they actually were very creative as his \u201cpixelated\u201d design is both a modern thing and a reference to the art style of his inspiration, which used a lot of checkered square designs in their ancient artwork.\n\nVaresa is not just luchadora; she\u2019s more of a big eater than anything else. But I get that her design doesn\u2019t have much Mexican influence.\n\nI like that Natlan\u2019s inspirations are subtle. It makes you question what exactly their inspirations are and when you find out, it suddenly clicks. Stereotypes can only get you so far and imo Liyue and Mondstadt have the most of these.

Thank you\n\nYeah I agree Mavuika\u2019s sun motif is associated with Mesoamerican imagery, but her whole design is kind of hanging onto that. Besides that she is just a biker chick. And I actually do love what they did with Kinich conceptually but it\u2019s all just a bit too watered down imo. Different tastes ig, if someone else loves the designs I can see that. \n\nBut I disagree that Liyue was stereotypical. (Mondstadt definitely is lol, average generically medieval isekai fantasy) They have legitimately Chinese motifs in their clothing, like it\u2019s clear that they were actually designed by Chinese people. They have a Miao/Hmong character, an opera singer, a Cantonese lion dancer, a rockstar etc. and for the most part it\u2019s all communicated well in their designs while maintaining a cohesive national aesthetic inspired by China. If done well like this, I don\u2019t believe that visible culture = stereotype.",

The main reason why recent female characters are getting so much complaints is the fanservice. And also, there ARE complaints about his design being modern even on this post, not to mention tiktok. \n\n  \nBack to the actual topic, I was explaining you why OP may get downvoted. They were saying female characters get hated because they are simply females while males characters don't get hated because they are simply males, when it is not true.\n\nEdit: Also my personal opinion. I'm not even a big fan of Ifa design but his design is WAY less modern compared to something like Mavuika motorbike. Unless he decided to pull out something like an ambulance in his kit, my opinion will stay the same.",
