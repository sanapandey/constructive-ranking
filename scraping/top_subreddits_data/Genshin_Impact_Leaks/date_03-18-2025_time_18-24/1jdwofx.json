Unless they add variants to every single side quest that involves Little Buddy, they cannot do anything significant. \n\nHonestly though, I do hope that they do that. Not only would it genuinely make me happy to see them actually replace every quest if a world quest character dies, but they've done a fantastic job with Natlan's side quests so far, finally connecting them. We already had Aranara and Narzissenkreuz, which both connected Sumeru and Fontaine's entire lore and world to them, as well as other areas. The obvious upgrade would be to have both lore, world, and other content be connected and change based on your progress in the quest.\n\nThough, an easy solution would be to simply lock out the last part of the world quest until you complete all the side quests, which would be a little drastic, but Aranara exists so it's not unfounded.",

Both of this cities were of high importance in the solidification of the Aztec Empire and its city Tenochtitlan, thanks to the legacy they left and was adopted by the Aztecs.\n\nTollan is also refered as a mythical place of origin for cultures like the Aztecs and the K'iche Mayans.\n\nFinally, the name Tollan comes from the Nahuatl and means \"Place of the\u00a0[tules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxodium_mucronatum)\". The tule, also known as ahuehuete in nahuatl (old man of the water), is a Native tree of Mexico and has been one of the most important and sacred trees since the prehispanic era, appearing even in creation myths. Actually, this is the national tree of Mexico, and is known as the stoutest tree in the world, with one of its specimens, the \"[\u00c1rbol del Tule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81rbol_del_Tule)\" in Oaxaca Mexico, reaching a diameter of 11.42 meters.\n\nHope it could be of help for anyone interested!",

Each of them have their own unique mechanics, Dragonspine has Sheer Cold, Chasm has the Lumenstone, Enkanomiya has the Dainichi Mikoshi, Sumeru has Sorush, and Fontaine has Remuria (which honestly doesn't have a unique mechanic, but I guess the book kinda counts?).\n\nSo if anywhere is going to have a unique mechanic, it'd be the Mare Jivari. Or they could easily go with my idea of having it not have a single Waypoint or Statue of the Seven, and force the players to actually traverse it. They also can't use gliders because no wind, and along with the Behemoth that \"supposedly\" caused the disappearance, it'd finally be a region where danger is actually prevalent.",

In order to make Lumine pop out in official media she needs to be saved lorevise by Aether and join him on his adventures \n\nit's not like HSR or WuWa where there your second \"version\" also is separated from your storyvise so it explains where devs rotate between Stelee and Caelus/female Rover and male Rover in trailers and official media.
