Plunge is an extremely niche archetype, even with Xianyun\u2019s buff and Varesa you only have about 4-7 decent DPS choices(half of which are honestly kinda cope anyway, one way or another).  She\u2019s not really worth your pull unless you have at least one of them, and it\u2019s hard to imagine them not putting the only dedicated plunge 4 star on her banner.\n\nIt also seems highly likely they want him on Varesa\u2019s banner as well, as they\u2019ve been putting \u201cconsolation prize\u201d 4 stars on new character banners recently, who fill a spot similar to the new 5 star(Sayu on Mizuki\u2019s banner, Diona on Citlali\u2019s, Heizou on Chasca\u2019s).

Got both of them ludicrously early.  I'm almost always up around 80 for pulls.  Anyway, I had a ton saved so was feeling frisky so went for emilie's weapon AND got Yelan's along the way.  Stupid decision in terms of primos but I never pull on weapon banners (well, I did once before when Primoral Jade cutter and key were on the banner with really really good 4 stars).  Figured I'd get Kinich (to go with Emilie) and the pyro archon (to go with both of them) and call it a day.  Then Xilonen came out and I had to skip.  Then Citlali came out.  Got Mavuika and then I burned through everything I had (including those shop materials from the first page that I had never used) for Citlali.  But I got Citlali.  Ended up getting \"lucky\" again by getting Jean around 14 pulls in putting in a few more wishes for Mavuika.  So sitting on pity and I'll have enough for Xilonen.  I might even be able to work towards Mavuika C2.  But I need to stop myself from doing something impulse again like I did after getting Emilie/Yelan early.",

Offering a solid plunge DPS unit on her banner seems borderline required to me.\n\nIt also keeps the banner theme going, especially since they\u2019ve been giving \u201cconsolation\u201d 4 stars on new banners lately(see Diona on Citlali\u2019s as the clearest case).\n\nBut yeah, the 4 star line up is probably going to be sick and I\u2019m planning on sinking as many pulls as I can get into it.
