You can watch from 3:03:40 if you want to see it from the start (when Gaming VA says to chat that he will call him), but Terashima Junta started introducing himself from 3:06:30. What I loved the most about this stream that Terashima-san took the role of voicing Aether (and the narration) in this quest, which was super funny and made me realize that they REALLY need to let the traveler speak more (he is speaking more than before but like...). His voice is really nice tho, and that's what made me wish he would voice a character in the first place, but I was expecting it to be more of a shounen one bc of the way he was voicing Aether. He was so reluctant to do it at the start though lol. He kept saying \"Am I -Terashima- allowed to do this?/Are you SURE that I'm allowed to do this?\" and Gaming's VA was like \"Yeah, it thinks so.\" in a slightly nonchalant way which was not making Terashima-san relaxed lol.\n\nBut seeing him struggle with Genshin Sumeru's names and terminology was so cute. I think he said that he only heard of the game (and knows of Paimon) but never played it (I heard from several JP VA that they let the JP VAs play the game, but these VAs have playable characters so...)\n\nAnyway, [top-tier voice acting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87QfY5C54PE&t=12835s).",
