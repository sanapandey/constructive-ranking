When you need someone *now*, the last thing you can do is pull your experienced employees off their tasks and have them focus on hiring. And especially when the majority of applicants are lying about their skills and experience, it can take hundreds of man hours to narrow down applicants for a single role to a pool of a dozen to phone screen and a handful to interview. And most of *those* are just people who lied better. \n\nSo it's just an optimization game -- which resumes can you ignore quickly, what questions and tests can you do to identify liars quickly, and what can you do as quickly as possible to get someone in who won't be terrible, with as little overhead as possible. \n\nIn tech, especially, it's one of the foundational reasons for hiring H1B workers and on- or off-shore contractors -- the company you're getting them through has done that vetting and their reputation in the space hinges on it.  You can pay a premium for a contractor for *years* before you can recoup the costs of hiring. \n\nWhich is why companies *massively* prefer hiring through networking rather than recruiters or the open market.",

Or whatever the ratio might be - the exact numbers aren't important. The point is everyone is doing their fair share while leaving room to redistribute the workload to account for problems or changes as they occur. If you cut it down to run on the bare minimum, when something *does* happen (and it will), the amount of work that can be done decreases, which means delays and lost profits. Hiring someone new takes more resources - and then even if they have experience in the industry, they'll need time to get up to speed with whatever work is being done. This is means even lower productivity.\n\nAssuming that entire process goes as smoothly as possible, running employees ragged leads to burnout and mistakes. The amount saved by having less people on the payroll is lost - plus a bit more - by workers slowed down from exhaustion and time spent going back to fix things.\n\nIt's the same reason you have IT or security. They're not there because you expect the computers to catch fire or have people breaking in 24/7. They're there so when something goes wrong (and it will), they're in place and familiar with the environment to start getting things up and running and prevent as much downtime as possible.",

The problem, at it's core, is there are too many jobs that are too easy for people to lie and bullshit their experience with on their resumes, and too many recruiters who are trying to place people as a numbers game. \n\nThe end result is you get literally hundreds of applicants for a job listing, and 90% of them are lying -- often extensively -- in the resume. And you're hiring because you don't have the resources to do the jobs that need to be done, so no one has time to filter out the applicants and figure out who is worth talking to. \n\nThe end result is the *vast* majority of hires are done via networking and if you're not networking -- or are new to a field and can't -- you're a minnow in a massive school of fish, with no way to stand out. \n\nIt's especially bad in tech, but pretty much any white collar job has this problem. There's, by and large, no professional certifications so there's no real way to filter people. A degree used to help, but they're both ubiquitous these days *and* largely meaningless, for most jobs, from a skill standpoint. Online degrees have dramatically impacted how meaningful a degree is. (As an aside, some people have wizened up to that and last time I was hiring, I started to see a trickle of people explicitly stating their degree was from an on-campus program.)\n\nBut if you can't get hired through the people you've worked with before, you're definitely boned these days.

Even if they are totally honest, one hour of a person's day that they have prepared for is not going to tell me if they are a good employee or not.  At best, I am hoping they say something stupid and disqualifying.  On its own, this would be fine.  But there is another, very fundamental problem: actually hiring and firing people is an absolute nightmare.  Were it the case that I could just hire a probationary employee and then can them after 30-60 days if they aren't working out and resume interviewing new candidates, it would be great.  But the modern corporate landscape is such that there is 0 guarantee that I will be able to re-open my staff req after.  This leads into the same thing that you mentioned: the best way to get hired is to be well recommended by someone who is trustworthy.  A good employee's recommendation is worth a thousand good interviews because I know I can trust a good employee to not dumpster their own reputation at the firm by recommending a total clown and wasting my time and potentially losing my staff req.",

She showed up 10 minutes late, didn't even introduce herself, and just started peppering me with questions angrily. I would describe the answer to something and she kept berating me to keep it simple and I should do the math a different way. 5 minutes before the interview was scheduled to end, I interrupted her and asked her a question. She totally flipped out and refused to answer until I finished her gauntlet of questions. Anyways, she would have been my boss and I'm kind of glad I didn't get that one.\n\nIt sucks though, because the other 5 interviewers were delightful and I fully completed all of their questions with like 20 minutes to spare.

In 2013 I began college because that\u2019s what we were told to do if we didn\u2019t wanna be failures who end up working at Ford (oh the irony, those Auto Workers are SET FOR LIFE barring automation).\n\nI took Gen Eds for two years while dipping my toes in majors and having a crisis of identity and purpose. I had friends who studied engineering, music, anthropology, mathematics and physics, friends who dropped out and worked in healthcare or trades. One friend dropped out and became an influencer and is very well off now. I stuck it out and eventually got an English degree which changed my life and helped me get my shit together but I did have a bumpy road in the job market and now I\u2019m in the trades. \n\nBut what I\u2019m getting at is I fully empathize with teens and young adults who aren\u2019t on track with their peers in that kind of self knowledge. Sure, at some point, we all just need a job that pays the bills so you should approach work and education with that at the front of your mind. But knowing what you like enough to do at least for a while if not for your life, what you\u2019re good at, what drives you, what you aren\u2019t good at but can learn and improve at, and what you simply don\u2019t have the skills or intelligence or innate personality/temperament/stomach for is really a lot to ask of 16 year olds. It is even harder when you consider the current state of the world and how futile the whole charade feels. Home ownership, disappearing retirement and social security, cost of living, job market saturation in fields that once seemed like guaranteed ROI like tech, academia selling a piece of paper that isn\u2019t worth the ink printed on it sometimes, recessions, mass blanket layoffs, rising fascism, we are at the mercy of so so so many forces beyond our control and you can do everything right and still lose. I applaud any young person who still has the will and the hope and the intellectual curiosity and the desire to rise to the challenge and achieve something for themselves and find what they love to do and do it better than anyone else. But I hold no shame or judgment for those who look out at the whole thing as a moot point and endless barriers to success because for many people, it is and they are stuck.",

Just like the advent of automated pipe cutters did the same in plumbing. Or automated looms in weaving. \n\nAI isn't going to eliminate classes of jobs. But it's already eliminated the number of people needed in many classes of jobs. \n\nAnd that's the point -- if you can get your degree using AI tools, someone *already in that job* can do what you'd be doing using the same tools.

And this will hopefully help you if you are looking for work or finding things frustrating! \n\nThe first situation you\u2019ve mentioned is however, very unlikely. One of the core universal targets for a recruiter is Time To Fill (time it\u2019s taken to fill the role from when we started searching). Because of this, if we are handed an ideal candidiate on a plate we will never say no to them as it\u2019s a quick win. If the role has been filled or is at final stages, of course you might not proceed but most businesses will keep your CV on record if it\u2019s that good. I of course cannot speak for 100% of the market here but that situation is extremely unlikely if you\u2019re in the right location and have matching compensation expectations to the role.\n\nThen I\u2019m sorry but I have to be a bit more candid but it\u2019s really just to help. Cover letters mean nothing. Having a CV with the perfectly tailored descriptions also mean nothing. \n\nWhat is relevant is what those 10 years look like. Have you grown in a role? Have you made logical moves to companies and discuss your moves? Have you had success? Do you have gaps and can you explain them clearly? Your CV is not about matching it to the job description, it\u2019s about outlining your career journey and showing your ready for your next step. If you get bogged down in the detail, your CV loses selling power. \n\nAnd lastly, ATS is literally just an applicant tracking system - Literally where your application goes so we can see it, understand the profile and proceed or reject if we need to. That\u2019s it. There\u2019s a gross misunderstanding of what an ATS is, there have been ATS\u2019s since the early 00s.\n\nI hope this helps, a bit.",

My last role, we were looking for a copywriter for months. Eventually someone reached out to one of us on Reddit of all places and we saw that he had worked at all of our competitors, had a great resume and portfolio, but was trashed by HR team. The HR team didn't know the companies he worked for but we sure did.\n\nI agree cover letters don't matter, but a few times they have for me.\n\nThe one about 10 years experience is the problem though with what you're saying in my eyes with recruiters. So on my resume, you'll see me move from an independent contractor, to a small agency, to a bigger agency, to 3 promotions within the agency, to  VERY well known brand, 2 promotions there, and then unfortunately a layoff. My trajectory is ideal and all the companies I've worked for are household names. However, I get written off by recruiters all...the...time.\n\nI wish I knew why.  Maybe you could educate me more on this, but with my credentials which honestly are pretty solid, I sent out something like 100 resumes last year (while still employed on the hunt) and had 1 interview. 1. I don't apply to dead jobs. I usually check daily and ONLY apply when sorting by posted within 24 hours. I did this every day.\n\nIn my last stint after layoffs, I sent out 20 a day doing the same thing to quality postings. I had 4 interviews out of 150 sent out.\n\nI'd be interested to hear your advice there.",

Frankly, it would be absurd to think a recruiter should be fit to judge this for the entire breadth of roles most corps need. I've worked mostly in technical roles, and recruiters do rule out candidates ALL THE TIME that should have been, at least, interviewed. \n\nOne big thing that stands out to me as a clear example of where I don't align with HR:\n\n>Do you have gaps and can you explain them clearly?\n\nNearly every person I've worked with, every manager I've worked for, and certainly in any interview process I've been a part of - We do not give a shit about this. Sometimes people have gaps, people are laid off and often people are forced to take time off work for a multitude of reasons. If an employee has relevant work experience and the skill set I'm looking for then I really don't care if they have a gap in their resume. A background check will catch anything that would disqualify them, this is just a needless question that will potentially weed out some good folks.",

People shouldn't be having to look for a new job every two years just to get a raise. And the shift from pensions to 401Ks has gotten rid of any incentive not to do so. What's more, hiring people is *expensive*, so having to hire people every two years rather than every 20 years causes a lot of overhead. And in the end the corporations end up having to pay market rate to replace the people who left anyway. So it's all just a huge gamble by the corporations to see how long they can string people along to keep their quarterly numbers look good and then when it bites them in the ass they also end up jumping ship. I guarantee that all of these corporate efforts to save money are just costing them even more money in the long run, but corporations have become incredibly myopic.",

The last time he had applied for a job was in 1990.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was having trouble finding work while in college around 2007 & 2008, he kept telling me to just march right into a company, ask to see the manager, and hand them my resume; said that\u2019s how he always found a job when he was in college (in the 60s).\n\n\n\nTold him that it didn\u2019t work like that anymore, but he was persistent. So I thought, sure, I\u2019ll give it a shot; that way I can report back and let him know. Went to one of the stores nearby, did exactly what he suggested, and got the results I expected: an eye roll from one of the employees and the manager laughing & telling me to take a hike & apply online like everyone else. Told my dad; he goes, \u201cWell, try harder!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nFast forward to 2015 or 2016: my dad was bored with retirement & looking for work. He tried his method a few times and got similar results. He finally caved and started applying online. Every time I visited it was a new complaint about how awful the job market was and how companies needed to do better. Despite having 20 years in the government with top secret clearance, none of that mattered to places like Home Depot or the local grocery stores. He was always pissed about how hard it was to find a job.\n\n\n\nI only told him \u201cI told you so\u201d once after hearing his complaints several times. He seemed a little agitated by that, but I could tell he knew I was right. He ended up apologizing for not understanding the situation when I was having trouble myself.\n\n\n\nFunny enough, he *did* end up finding a part time job with a ham radio equipment shop around 2019. Only to then discover soon afterwards that he had liver cancer, which rapidly spread throughout his body & killed him in 2021. That was four years ago this week.",

So we have to go through multiple interviews, check with references and previous employers, pull background checks, run competency tests, etc. And we still get fooled and find out months later that this person doesn't have the learning ability to use a pencil sharpener.\n\n\nI think the job market has become so competitive that people just apply for everything they can and see what hits they get.

The market is so flooded with 3-5+ years experience and entry level roles alike are few and far between that lying is a must to stay competitive. being 3 years out of a college with a good degree and school I\u2019ve had easier times getting jobs in highschool and college then my post grad career. Fuck this job market. if lying gets me ahead and allows me to put a roof over my head I could care less about how it impacts others, I have bills to pay and mouths to feed. Call this, the effects of late stage capitalism",

You get pissed off that there weren\u2019t nine fuck-ups and one perfect person because now you have to decide between ten great candidates. \n\nYou parse through and talk and talk and talk and barely decide on three names to send to the provost for one more interview.\n\nThen you find out the three of them have taken other opportunities and they have to go back to the other 7 who have already moved on, so you might have to start back at the HireVues\u2026that\u2019s the worst, because you have to listen to them again (or refer back to your notes, which you don\u2019t have because ODHR asked you to destroy them since they don\u2019t want them to become exhibit A in a law suit\u2026like I\u2019m writing something that\u2019d get me sued\u2026). \n\nI fucking hate it. I hate it so much. I\u2019m at a point in my career where I just want to throw a dart at a bunch of random names and say \u201cFuck it, welcome to higher education buddy\u2026don\u2019t do drugs in front of your students and please don\u2019t be a creep.\u201d \n\nThe process is demoralizing on both ends. And I\u2019m not even in the corporate world.",

            "body": "I really question what people consider a \"job search\" to be. Back in 2016 when I first started looking for work before finishing college I had almost no responses from submitting applications online. Maybe once in a while I'd find a small and obscure company that would give me a shot, but generally it was a dead end. \n\nBut my entire time in undergrad I made myself attend the career fair every single year and get comfortable talking to people in person and attending various events. Eventually through both utilizing the school's career fair and career center with on site campus interview jobs I was able to secure two offers. \n\nNow you might think \"oh well you took advantage of being in school where companies know to get people\". Yes, of course I did, but even then I still went out of my way to attend a job fair outside of my school in a local city away from my school. I showed up in person and met with people who were looking to hire and got good feedback from experienced people even if it gave me no job.\n\n2 years later I found myself out of work towards the end of 2017. What did I do? In addition to trawling job boards, one of the first things I did was google \"Job fairs\" and lo and behold there was a job fair in my industry at a local training center not too far from me. I went there, met with a gentleman at a booth who was impressed with my experience. I also met with the person that organized the job fair and she provided me with some very interesting information in regards to government programs I could take advantage of as well as a way to get a very important certification that would help me secure a high degree of job security. From there, the company I spoke with called me up to do an on-site interview and I drove one hour out to a military base to sit in a room surrounded by a bunch of old tech guys and talk about my experience. Concurrently I took a training course, gained a certification that was very relevant for my industry, took another course for free using a government program recommended to me by the job fair person, and also managed to actually get another job offer from a well known company that I applied to off...Indeed! of all places. Also, LinkedIn was a thing back then, but I was not getting much traction on my profile off of it. \n\nAnyways, I took the offer from the company that I applied to off LinkedIn and since then I have worked at 5 different companies and most of my offers now come from recruiters that reach out to me on LinkedIn or on lesser known job social networking sites. You will be shocked how many obscure places have job boards where companies are looking to hire. For example, YCombinator has a job board for companies that they back, so you can work at an innovative start-up if you really put in the effort to reach out. \n\nNow, every situation is unique, and I recognize that not everyone is a tech worker with a good skillset, but you have to think about it from a business minded PoV. How do you really add value to a company, what's going to convince someone with hiring power that you are worth bringing onto their team? It's not about the buzzwords you toss out or your ability to understand and respect the company you are looking for. It's your comprehension, competitive advantage, and ability to deliver when needed.",

It sucks, especially when you need visa-some permission from the government and/or you don't need local language for your work.

And why the heck can't we have multiple interviews at the same day and get a response as quickly as possible? Why does this interviewing processes taking so long? To interview with the other candidates to select the best one? Sure. Then why are they rushing for an answer when they gave an offer? Clearly, they have time for the position. Sorry, you are not the only company I'm interviewing/getting an offer right now. Because it takes at least a month to get an offer, and they are pushing hard to get the sign as quickly as possible to prevent further negotiations.\n\nAlso, job security become more and more just some text from the law books.",
