            "body": "It was *the* way computers died at the time. Silver lining was that finding/seeing a blown/leaking capacitor was such a fast diagnosis.\n\nHalf the time a dead box would come in, pop the case open, a quick, \"Well there's yer problem right there,\"  and best of all it's something you can show a layperson and they'd understand. (See that little coke-can lookin thing? It's not supposed to be opened. Spilled your mother-soda ya did.)\n\nSolid state capacitors changed the whole damn game.",

There were so many calls I\u2019d go to where they\u2019d say a workstation died and it would normally be this one type of Dell I think. I became so sure of it at one point I stopped being like \u201cyeah let me take a look and I\u2019ll come find you once I figure it out\u201d to \u201cI already know what\u2019s wrong, watch this\u201d and sure enough a blown capacitor.",
