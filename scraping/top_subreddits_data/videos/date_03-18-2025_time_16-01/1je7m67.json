I would love to say that this is isolated, that Hunter will go on to have a normal life and people will now feel bad that they were like this...\n\nBut it is more than likely that the bully is backed up by all of his family, the community, the churches and the school system. It's so pervasive, that even in towns like Huntsville - where you have an insane amount of PHDs and intelligent people, anti-LGBTQ sentiments rage. We have had a few suicides over the last few years involving gay teens - directly because of the insane and pervasive bullying. \n\nIt's only going to get worse as the education system is dismantled.",

But from what I have seen from a lot of different angles with regards to the school system, its a complete breakdown at EVERY level.\n\nI can tell you about the autistic kid at Mountain Gap that got bullied and beaten so badly, he lost a testicle. The teacher and principal knew, as it came out in discovery, but they chose to do NOTHING. They are still employed there to this day. \n\nOr Nigel Shelby, who was \"bullied by his peers for his race and sexual orientation, and when he sought help from school administrators, was told that his sexuality was his choice,\u201d the news release said Monday. \u201cSchool administrators did not alert Nigel\u2019s parents of his struggles in school so that he could receive help from a licensed mental health professional. On April 18, 2019, Nigel Shelby died by suicide. Following his death, school administrators alerted Nigel\u2019s mother to look for a suicide note in his backpack, revealing that they were aware of his plans to take his own life.\u201d",
