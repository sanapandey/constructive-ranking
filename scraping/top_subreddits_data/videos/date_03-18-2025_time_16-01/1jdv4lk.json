Then me and the girl I was dating at that time (we were watching this show together) ended up breaking up and I never went back to finish watching this show. \n\nI've been wanting to finish it... So, is the final season that bad?",

Did you even analyze the report that you cited?\n\nMost NATO countries aren't meeting the 2% of GDP guidelines, however, all of them have been meeting the requirement that 20% of their defense spending go towards NATO. Also, you can see that since 2014, EVERY NATO country has made progress towards the 2% of GDP guideline.\n\nWhich means, likely, that all NATO countries are increasing defense spending so that they meet the 2% of GDP guideline eventually. I'll bet that regardless of president they would meet the 2% of GDP guideline by the end of this decade.\n\nC'mon, do you think any country is capable of such a sudden increase in spending towards one category of their budget? At least they're making progress. Also consider the fact that the majority of those years occurred under Obama and Biden. \n\nThe amount of money that EU spends towards defense as a percentage of their budget was an issue highlighted by Obama, not Trump. \n\nTo call this the single issue which led to fascism in our country is absurd, and you're a dunce for citing statistics without the ability to analyze statistics.",
