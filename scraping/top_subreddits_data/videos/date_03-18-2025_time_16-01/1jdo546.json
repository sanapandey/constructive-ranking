If we view the green eggs and ham as a symbolic, or be it literal representation of his own, ahem,  two eggs and ham, we now have the story of a man in search of what he likes. But wait, no, the story is from the perspective of Rockwell, as now a \"recovered\" sex addict practicing Buddhism but being constantly tempted by the world around him. A man vs self battle for the ages. His physiological id is the character Sam, who constantly tempts him with the ideas of  whether or not he would like his eggs and/or ham in a wild array of animate and inanimate everyday things. Despite seemingly being in control for the entire story, our main character insists that he does not like his ham and/or eggs in any of these things. But our defiant Buddhist is no match for his own lust for the world. The story concludes with him relapsing and coming to terms with who he is as he now finds true peace within himself by accepting his id as who he truly is as he proclaims \"I do so like green eggs and ham. Thank you. Thank you. Sam, I am\"",

They laughed at how fast my head turned though, lol. \ud83d\ude00 (out of surprise)\n\nIn Chiang Mai, they have a super fun \"night market\" where they shut down a street and there's a ton of vendor stalls with all sorts of cool things. The street food is amazing, and everyone is very polite. \n\nJust wandering about, there was a random marching band going down the street for a school graduation. It was super neat and I loved seeing that slice of life in another country. I got some cool art pieces that are still proudly displayed in my living room.\n\nThere's very old architecture and Wats EVERYWHERE, and most are still in use. You can walk in, with RESPECT and politeness, and look around. They're beautiful and the monks might even tell you about the history. I have a bracelet given to me by one that I cherish.\n\nMy next stop was Cambodia (to see Ankor Wat), now that was skeezy. I was smoking a cigarette outside after lunch and some random tuktuk driver pulled this on me:\n\nYou want tuk tuk?\n\nNo.\n\n(steps up, and a bit quieter) You want shoot AK-47?\n\nUh, no. Just smoking a cigarette.\n\n(Leans in real close) You want little girl?\n\nMy alarm bells went off, said NO and went right back into the restaurant. Ugh.\n\nAnkor Wat was worth it, though. It was like being in an Indiana Jones movie. Climbed a few pyramids and was surprised to see Buddhist monks there too! They were just as welcoming as in Thailand.\n\n\n10/10, just keep your head on your shoulders. Be polite, you're a guest, and know how to handle certain \"situations\".",

We pulled him off and got the girl out but he continued to follow us. Rule of law is basically non-existent and a lot of the people who show up are there for that exact reason, but none approached how distinctly bad the Russians were.\n\n\nThailand on the other hand was exquisite. Bangkok is definitely overwhelming initially but man it is full of life and some wonderful people, and I dont think Ive experienced a calm as deep as I did in Chiang Mai. I immediately understood why a lot of people spend long periods of time working remotely from there.",

His monologue is basically about chasing a desire that feels purposeful and consuming, but then discovering that upon achieving the goal, the satisfaction never comes or is fleeting. The goalposts just always move.\n\nHere he's talking mostly about sex, but it\u2019s the same with wealth, fame, or any other pursuit people think will complete them. The moment someone achieves what they thought they wanted, they realise it wasn\u2019t the solution to their deep dissatisfactions in life. It\u2019s an endless cycle of craving, achieving, and then feeling just as empty as before. And because we\u2019re wired to always be striving, people rarely stop to ask whether the thing they\u2019re chasing is actually meaningful to them or if they just need something.. anything to chase.\n\nThis is a big theme right now, especially with discussions about billionaires and late-stage capitalism. People wonder why someone with more money than they could ever spend keeps trying to make more, but it\u2019s the same principle, money was never the thing, it was just a stand in for purpose, power, or validation. And once they get it, they realise it still doesn\u2019t scratch the itch, so they just keep going.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of existentially exhausting. If satisfaction is always just out of reach, how do you ever actually feel content?\n\nAnd the answer being hinted at, and something that can often be seen as somewhat of a tired clich\u00e9.. is to shift your perspective, away from getting something to fulfill us and toward being present with what we already have. If the cycle of chasing is endless, then the only way out is to stop believing that the next thing will be the one that finally makes us feel whole. Real contentment probably comes from embracing the process rather than obsessing over the outcome. \n\nOf course, that\u2019s easier said than done. It\u2019s hard to unlearn the idea that happiness is just one more accomplishment away. But maybe the trick is recognising that there\u2019s nowhere to 'arrive' at. There\u2019s just the experience of living... and the sooner we stop looking for some grand resolution, the more we can actually enjoy it.\n\n\u201cHappiness, not in another place but this place\u2026 not for another hour, but this hour.\u201d",

I had the perception that taking the show to Thailand was going to explore spirituality.\n\nThe daughter who wants to meditate in Thailand kind of hits that niche, but it's still more about cultural aspects of a Southern family who use their Christian \"identity\" more as virtue signaling than true religious experience. We don't actively see the daughter really getting into religious things though. Lighting a candle and sitting Indian style... whatever.\n\nBut this long monologue from Sam Rockwell... what a delightful and bizarre work of writing and delivery... This entire monologue is an ode to, \"The Path of Excess Leads to the Tower of Wisdom,\" a proverb from William Blake's Proverbs of Hell.\n\nI think this is the most substantive look at religion and Buddhism specifically. This man has plumbed the depths of ego and hedonism and found not just addiction but a sort of total emptiness or nihilism in his own depravity and quest to live all possible experience in the sexual realm.\n\nThis reminds me of a Black Mirror episode where two male buddies meet in a VR realm to fight each other in a street fighter game. In the game, though, they engage in an odd romantic escapade that is exclusive to the game. They take a look at a relationship in real life but find it's only as a male and female character in the game that it has any power for them.\n\nSimilarly, Rockwell talks about BEING an Asian girl. This is way outside my wheelhouse, but at its heart I see a stumbling into what most major religions in the world are trying to do: show you that ego is a problem and chasing pleasure will leave you empty.",

The youths who'd profess actual hate for Buddhism/Monks in general would be a very small minority for sure. \n\nA particular disdain for corrupt monks exists through the mainstream society for sure, but that'd be true for both the devout and the not.\n\nThe vow of poverty in particular, makes it harder to go over a certain limit without it becoming obvious and facing pushback from society in general. It's why there's a particular hatred for the Dhammakaya sect, the Scientology of Buddhism, who don't even hide the hoarding of wealth. In a way, because the vow of poverty is still so foundational and mainstream in the Thai view of Buddhism, these corrupted instances are viewed in the same way that some Christians would view mega churches or televangelists as foundationally not Christian. And I would say the Thai Youths who extend that hatred to the main body of Buddhism/Monks is a minority.\n\nNot 100% sure what you're trying to say about the car thing, but the cultural worship of the wealthy and the indicators for that is a very real cultural thing. Just doesn't have anything to do with religion.\n\nThe Western idealization of Buddhism is very real and can get quite annoying, but I think you overcorrected here. Buddhism is still quite foundational to Thais, and their lives are still entwined quite deeply with monks and the places of worship, so we're not seeing anything *near* the disenfranchisement that has happened with Christians and their churches. \n\n93% of Thais are Buddhists, and 92% of Buddhists still go out of their way to give alms to monks (pretty static across age ranges). I wish I could find a stat for temple visits, but alas could not. But I would posit it remains high. Every other stat sure seems to be.",

Bascially a narcisist calling someone else a narcisist. A pedophile priest influencing government about protecting the children.  \n\nIt all makes sense, and it's so fucking shit. People with their own demons creating more demons.   \n\n\"All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.\"  \n-Blaise Pascal  \n\nEdit: just want to share another one of my favorite writings on folly:  \nhttps://sacred-texts.com/bud/sbe10/sbe1007.htm",

But I can tell you that the other poster is specifically referencing the pseudoscientific Blanchard model of transsexuality which posits that trans women are seeking sexual thrill by posing as women.\n\nI don't know whether 'cis men whose thoughts about being women are exclusively in the context of sex and never anything else and are definitely not closeted trans people' exist as anything more common than, say, fantasies about sex with the Sun. Something which I don't know a name for and which Google doesn't tell me a name for. If this 'autogynephilia-like experience' exists as an actual fetish (and not as a life-inhibiting obsession that should be spoken about with a therapist, like Sam Rockwell's character in that scene) then it should have a name different from 'autogynephilia', because autogynephilia is always going to be connected to the idea that enjoyment of oneself as a woman is a sexual activity which cis women supposedly, according to the coiner of the term, do not experience\n\nPart of the problem here is of course going to be dancing around the idea that a cis man experiencing those thoughts is Definitively Never Going To Come Out, and that's both something where we feel a need to be respectful in someone's declared gender identity as men, and of course everyone should have their gender identity taken at face value without questioning, but also, outside of talking about any specific individual to question their identity, we just don't know the future. Many times, these experiences turn out to be part of a dialogue with gender that finds more expressions over time, to where even if that person is not a trans woman, they may eventually find that they are still something other than a 'cis man 100% of the time'\n\nShit's complicated, so I guess reiterating and tl;dr - there would need to be a different word for everyone to understand what is actually being posited in that person's situation",

Any trans women not suitably attractive he deemed autogynephilic perverts. His methodology was practically nonexistent and his \"research\" is obviously just an excuse to help him sleep around with attractive women.\n\nWhether you like it or not, **that** is what \"autogynephilia\" means. To use the term with legitimacy is to give weight to debunked pseudoscience being maliciously used to drive transphobic propaganda. And you can't use the argument \"oh well I'm just using the word to describe an unrelated fetish\". \n\nIt's the same as how \"phrenology\" started as a benign European theory to try to explain brain function and dates back decades before it was popularized as a justification for racism. But obviously none of that matters anymore; if you try to give legitimacy to the concept of \"phrenology\", regardless of context, you're going to look like a massive fucking racist.\n\nThe same way if you give legitimacy to the concept of \"autogynephilia\" you are going to look like a massive fucking transphobe. Because \"autogynephilia\" isn't describing '*men with a fetish of imagining themselves as women'*, \"autogynephilia\" is describing '*transgender identities are just a fetish*'.\n\nJust like how the Nazis ruined the Buddhist swastika, blame Blanchard for ruining the word autogynephilia.",

I feel no shame about my sexuality or being a woman in a patriarchal society, the shame should be on those that perpetuate it by telling people that dresses, heels and makeup make you a woman.\n\n\nI too think that adults should be free to live their lives as they please, as long as they don't force anyone to experience something they don't want to experience, but disintegrating the meaning of biological sex to conflate it with some random internal feeling that is related to regressive, stupid stereotypes has extremely negative consequences for women, children AND men.
