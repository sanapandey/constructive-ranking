            "body": "\nI take issue with some of the pop-neuroscience oversimplifications. The idea your brain has several predictions in queue for what happens next is fabricated. An athlete has strengthened neural pathways for specific motions; increased myelin sheaths around axons and synaptically pruned weaker connections. The brain isn\u2019t modeling future scenarios; it reacts reflexively to immediate, relevant stimuli, shaped by training. In other words the brain doesn\u2019t check other possible routes; it takes the strongest/fastest connection.\n\nBayesian Brain Hypothesis, Predictive Coding, Multiple Hypothesis Prediction are theoretical frameworks, not experimentally proven, concrete facts. Even if parallel predictive possibilities are a real thing the tennis player analogy misapplies it. Such models might apply to uncertain, novel or complex decisions not well practiced motor responses.\n\nThen the banana scene: The idea that your brain is actively predicting falling, reacting to it, and correcting mid-fall ignores how these responses are learned. As toddlers, we refine balance and coordination through trial and error. The reaction isn\u2019t calculated in real time; it\u2019s the result of hardened, efficient pathways formed over years of practice.\n\n/rant\n\nPop science is flooded with garbage because the entire system rewards BS over truth. Academia forces grad students to publish \"novel\" ideas to graduate, so they dress up trivial findings or make shaky claims just to get papers out (Publish or parish). Nobody cares about replication or caution, just headlines and citations. Then media and science influencers take these half-baked theories, strip out all nuance, and sell them as fact because \u201cThe Brain Predicts the Future!\u201d sounds sexier than \u201cUnproven Model Suggests... Maybe.\u201d It\u2019s a cycle of hype, oversimplification, and clickbait dressed up as science. No wonder people swallow nonsense.",

Its a very fascinating subject, learning how the different components in the brain processing our sensory input and tries to extrapolate from that. For most people, the method of processing is more or less consistent, but sometimes the disagreements is a matter of a different perception.\u00a0\n\n\nSome of my favourite particular facts in this regard 1) how our visions has blindspots near our peripheral, but we don\u2019t really see that gap because our brain tries to fill in the gaps until our eyes look at the area our blindspot is on. The less amount of sensory input or efficiency it has to rely on, the more inconsistent less accurate its interpolation will be. For example, I remember being very sleep deprived during my exam season. As I was eating at an indoor cafe, I thought I saw a blue butterfly fluttering in the corner of my eye. I whipped my head to look \u00a0at it and it was no longer there. Then looking back where I originally was, that \u201cgap\u201d was filled with something I did see being there. That\u2019s why its not uncommon when you go to a sketchy, isolated area when its dark, sometimes our eyes does \u201csee things\u201d from interpolating our surrounding environment based on what we know.\n\n\n2) Knowing other animals have different sensory organs than we do, leading them to also have a different depiction of the world than we do. Bats can hear frequencies we cannot. Some birds and bees can see colours in the ultraviolet range which is outside of the (human) visible spectrum.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe idea there is so much we aren\u2019t perceiving *or* how differently we are perceiving the same world from other animals, and even some humans. Its fascinating! It makes sense that why we as humans do seek or value confirmation or affirmation from others in our species. But even then, you still have things like mass hysteria, placebo, nocebo, etc, just so many things that can really trip us up and mess with our perception of reality.\u00a0",
