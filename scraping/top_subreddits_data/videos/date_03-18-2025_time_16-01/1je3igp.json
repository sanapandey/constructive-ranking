She opens her very first appearance with double entendres about erections and his trousers and proceeds to flirt with him in every other interview as she gets more comfortable. She's touching his leg and hand, having him walk her to her seat by hand etc. She brings a strong flirty energy and I don't think makes any objections beyond a laughing \"oh I didn't mean _that_\" after her \"I've worked upstairs _and_ downstairs line\".",
