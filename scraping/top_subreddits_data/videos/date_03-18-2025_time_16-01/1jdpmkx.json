            "body": "That was genuinely interesting... kudos to the person who made it. It's quick, well-researched and well presented without fluff.\n\nI also find it interesting because as I was born in the 1970's and grew up in the UK, it never occurred to me to wonder why there were so many leisure centers. They just... were. And they were a frequent place for my dad to take me and my brothers on a Sunday to go to the pool. I used to absolutely love it and credit it still with the fact that I'm a very strong swimmer and still really enjoy it. As I got into my teens it became a place I went myself, and even during summer holidays from school I remember walking to the leisure center a couple of times a week to take a swim because it was cheap and great exercise. And once I was out of school and on my own, it was a cheap place to go out and sometimes meet up with friends (and girls... can't forget the girls I would meet in the weight room...) that didn't involve eating and drinking... especially the drinking. I didn't really drink at all until after I moved to the US, although I occasionally had a tipple and even worked as a bartender for a while in London. \n\nHeck, I remember I would often go for a quick workout in the gym, hit up the pool for a cool-down swim, grab a shower then go up to the arcade that was also in the leisure center and pop 10p and 20p coins into the video games for an hour or two, and by then it was time to get the bus back home.\n\nMoving to the US it was eye-opening to me that things like that just don't exist... or at least not much. The YMCA is one option, and some council-run fitness centers exist but they seem to be different in focus than the leisure centers in the UK. More about training and getting fit... more regimented. Less about just hanging out and \"doing your own thing\".",

As a kid we used to go there to play badminton with my family, or go swimming with friends, or play indoor football. I would say it was more a way for my parents to be active than me as outside of badminton at the weekends I was on my bike riding around any marginally muddy part of the local parks or playing football in the same parks.\n\nNot sure how much of a london thing it was but there were so many parks we could play football or ride bikes that were within a 10 minute ride.",
