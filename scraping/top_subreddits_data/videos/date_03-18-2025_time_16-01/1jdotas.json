They were joking about Conan sleeping with executives to get a show and Conan saying that they didn't wanna sleep with him. Saying his therapist didn't want him on their couch either doesn't really work or support or further the line of the joke. It's like a dead end tributary off the main branch of the joke itself. \n\nIt's fine, if it was a friend or something who said it they'd get a 'haha yeah' laugh, but it got the love it deserved here. \n\nAnd I like Gourley.",

This is a comedy podcast with two professional comedians riffing with each other. The joke didn't land.

Different comedy sensibilities I guess. It's good to go into detail about stuff like this though. Really adds to the comedy.",

And I had thought myself weak for not being able to handle it all in stride. \n\nThe change that came from this whole experience wasn\u2019t some sort of revelatory outlook on life. It was simply forgiveness. I looked at this broken person and embraced them and essentially told them it\u2019s okay. I forgave myself for all these failures I had been beating myself up for all those years and decided to move forward in life. \n\nAll this happened in a time frame I can\u2019t quite pin down but I know it wasn\u2019t truly a long introspective period. It might have been 30 minutes but it felt much longer. \n\nWhen I woke up the next day it was like a weight had lifted. I had a lot of work to do, but, I wasn\u2019t overwhelmed.
