More so, the smartest in society generally tend not to fall for materialism and the will to dominate. \n\nThey don't work harder than a single parent, working 2 jobs or  junior doctor. \n\nIt's not just access to capital, as many people born to wealth don't become billionaires and the like. \n\nThe difference is always the extent to which they're willing to ruthlessly exploit and stamp down on everyone lower than them, as shamelessly as possible, to gouge the absolute most out of them and a cold, insatiable hunger and will to dominate. The results of which they hope will fill the hole in their soul where their parents love for them should've been.",
