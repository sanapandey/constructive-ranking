            "body": "I somewhat agree. I think it really started going downhill just a couple of years ago.\n\nThere is an app for everything, and if you are not a regular user it just makes your life more difficult. For example, in my city we have multiple apps just for parking. You need to find out what parking area you are in, find the app and hope that your credit card details are still valid. It makes it even more difficult for tourists that only stay here for a week. And it's also pretty irritating when you are traveling and have to download 5 apps just for a weekend trip to be able to go to the concert you booked, pay for parking and even pay for oranges at the farmers market.\n\nIt's the same with appointments, many businesses only allow you to book through an app, but they use 2-3 different ones and don't take bookings over the phone. It's so frustrating.\n\nAlso, all of the supermarkets have different apps. To be able to get a discount you have to use their app, and you feel super frustrated when you don't bother and miss out on the discount.\n\nAnd don't get me started on all of the different streaming services. It was very convenient, but now it's ridiculous.",

Phillips Hue lights work fine with no Internet. The only requirement is that your local network still works.\n\nThe only problem I've ever had was a perfect storm of hardware failure and purposefully-bad settings on my part.  My router died which killed my local network, and I had taken the lights off on the default \"come back on at full brightness after a power outage\" setting to \"revert to the previous state after a power outage\". So I lost voice/app control, and flipping the light switch off and back on, which would have brought them back to full brightness under the default settings, instead brought them to their previous setting . . . which was \"off\".",

My AC is from just before app control was a thing, and I have to control it with this huge remote. The unit itself has no display, the remote has a small display with minimal info. To set stuff like timers I have to refer to a huge instruction sheet, press a long sequence of buttons, and only way I get feedback is through beeps from the ac unit.\n\nThe ac unit and remote aren't synced, so if I press a button and the IR bulb or sensor are obscured the units are out of sync. So I can end up in a situation where the AC unit is set to a different temp than the display on the remote. The only way to get them in sync again is to change the temp to the min or max temp until I hear the AC unit double beep, to indicate it rejected the command to change temp.\n\nHow much easier it would be to have an app that shows me everything, lets me change things with a simple touch, instead of resetting the entire weeks schedule with a million button pushes if I want to change the setting of one hour of one day.\n\nSame goes for my electric heaters, my new app controlled ones are so much better than the old ones, and my light timers. Come to think of it, all my complaints are with setting week schedules through terrible button interfaces :P",

            "body": "Yup, and this was always inevitable. It's the natural result of any technological development - the only thing that's really changed is the *pace* of that development.\n\nThe clearest example of this is probably the Car:\n\nWhen the car was invented, it was a technological miracle that empowered the average person to travel further and faster than they ever had before. Within a single generation, owning a car became something that made your life significantly easier and more awesome than it would have been without one.\n\nBut as more and more people got cars, we started designing our societies around the expectation that everybody had one. For a moment, think about how crazy the term \"walkable city/town/etc...\" actually is. Walking is the default mode of human motion. So why is \"walkable\" even a common adjective we apply to our communities? Shouldn't every human settlement be \"walkable\"? But they're not, because more and more we are designing our living spaces around the expectation that you have a car.\n\nAnd if you don't have a car, there are entire communities you can't take part in. For example, the average Suburb is so \"stretched out\" that trying to live in one without a vehicle can be nearly impossible. Grocery stores, schools, places of work - all of those things are too far away to walk or bike to, because the entire community was built around the idea that everybody living in it would have a car.\n\nIt's not the \"cars\" have directly made life harder for people. Its that the *expectation that everybody should have a car* can make life very hard for pedestrians. Hell, its gotten so bad that the governments are thinking about implementing \"15 minute cities\" (intentionally walkable and mostly self contained urban communities) in order to push back against this trend.\n\nCars are far from the \"latest technological development\", but I think they're a good illustrative example of this concept.\n\nIt's not the technology actively makes life more difficult. Its that designing a society around a new technology can often make life very difficult for those who cannot or will not adopt it.",

It has been here since before cars were a thing.  Back then that was considered walkable, because if you didn't have a horse that was your only option.  You walked for hours or days to get where you wanted to go.  Those people would look at our suburbs and see a luxurious amount of convenience and access. \n\nSo yeah, we could do much better on our city design.  But it's still a net improvement.

Instead of using a single cup for your daily liquid consumption, you now use 5, and have to load 5 times as many in and put 5 times as many away, instead of just rinsing the one you use. \n\nThe car. Now you can take a job that is 30 miles away, and takes 60 minutes to get to because of traffic. And the reason you took that job is so you can afford that car? \n\nThese are just examples, but please feel free to give an example of a technology that hasn't created more work.",

More clothes are produced per hour, meaning the same population of, say, 10000 people needs fewer loom workers than weavers, allowing the people who would\u2019ve been weavers to do something else that isn\u2019t a need, like writing or art.",

You now own seven $5 shirts that you wash once a week but take longer because there are more of them. And you spent more than 3 times what you would have on shirts, so you need to work more to afford them. \n\nAnd now that you have so many clothes, and you are working all the time you need to buy a washing machine. Which you need to work even more to pay off etc. ect. And since you have the washing machine you might as well do more loads of laundry each week instead of just once.",
