They can be weak, reused, stolen, or phished.\n\nPasskeys, on the other hand, are a newer, more secure way to sign in. Instead of typing something, you just use your device (Phone, Password Manager, FIDO Key, which you unlock with biometrics or a PIN). They rely on cryptographic keys stored on your device, making them resistant to phishing and data breaches.\n\nNot everyone or everything supports them yet, but they're hopefully the future (Google and Microsoft are pushing hard for it).",

It's also not always allowed as sometimes you'll be banned from having a second device. Having one device sitting unattended and unchecked for months at a time which can unlock everything is considered its own security risk.",

It's not likely that someone is going to extract my name specifically from a list and attempt to decode a system that they're not even aware exists.\n\nAnd if they did, I still don't think it's possible without a sample size of at least half a dozen and a few hints on top.\n\nAs an example using a system that's close in concept but entirely different in execution, my Reddit password would first have about 6 characters that are the same across all systems. Let's say gR4!P0 just for fun. This string means nothing, it's just some random nonsense I typed and remembered years ago.\n\n Now we're generating a reddit password. Reddit is social, and it's not very important, so it gets put through a simple cipher I can do in my head without thought.\n\nSo I take the name and the category \"redditsocial\" and I alternate the characters by shifting them one space to the left or right in my keyboard and it becomes \"twfsordivus;\" and I bang that on top of the original string and I've got \"gR4!P0twfsordivus;\"\n\nFor accounts that I find important I use 2fa and a slightly more complicated cipher just to make sure that the patterns can't be brute forced quite as easily as the rest.\n\nHonestly the biggest bane of my existence is when I sign up to a website that thinks it knows better than I do and it introduces all kinds of dumb rules like strict character requirements, while at the same time refusing to tell me what the requirements were when I'm trying to log in. I have a few standard variations to accommodate most of those requirements but they still trip me up all the time and I usually end up just resetting my password to get in.",
