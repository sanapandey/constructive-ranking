There's plenty of debate on when the modern era *began*, but there's basically none on whether or not today counts as the \"modern era\".\n\nA quick google search tells me that some historians consider the start of the modern era to be even as late as WWI, but most put it at the beginning of or during the age of exploration. Seems reasonable enough to me that you could place it back a little further with the fall of Constantinople, like you pointed out. Which means most historians would put 1848 right smack dab in the middle of the modern era.\n\nAgain, *by definition*, the modern era includes the present. Seriously, go look it up if you don't believe me. This is not a debatable topic.",

The middle ages will always be inbetween the Classical period and the Renaissance, so it will still be in the middle, but it might get renamed because we've realised that they actually did a lot of cool stuff in that period (that's also why we don't call it the Dark Ages anymore)",

If anything, the latter is the most likely to change its name, since we've been living in a period of time with no strong name (\"the modern area\" and its derivatives) ever since the Renaissance.\n\nThe only way it could change in my opinion would be if the historians decided on a more specific division of the time periods, but then the Middle Ages wouldn't be renamed as much as further subdivided into shorter eras.",
