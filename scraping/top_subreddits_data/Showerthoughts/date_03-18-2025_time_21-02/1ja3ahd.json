Since the Line Islands are 24 hours ahead of Hawaii, the first twin would have a birthdate of Wednesday, while the second twin would be born a bit earlier in the \"calendar\" on Monday or Tuesday, but according to time, they would still be younger.

The unix epoch time is defined as the number of seconds, or milliseconds, since January 1st 1970 UTC. The start of epoch time is one moment that existed in time, there's no ambiguity about that, every moment that existed in time since then has a definite unix epoch time value. \n\nSo, consider PST vs PDT in November - when PDT transitions to PST the hour of 2am happens twice. However, the unix time value doesn't shift with dst, so if you ask a computer which comes first, 11/2/25, 2:30AM PDT or 11/2/25 2:05AM PST it'll accurately tell you 2:30AM PDT is before 2:05AM PST. Because time in time zones don't exist, they're just a local customary representation of a UTC time, a unix epoch time.\n\nThe key word in the title here is \"considered.\" Considered by whom?
