The First Nations peoples are also unique from all other humans on earth, but they share cultural characteristics to other indigenous peoples such as a system of justice, shared oral history, and spiritual rituals for burying their deceased and beliefs. \n\nThe kangaroo features in Australian indigenous culture and I hear that American tourists are treated to a delicacy of bush tucker including kangaroo tail. One tourist once asked how long it takes for the kangaroo to regrow its tail and the elder had to lie and tell them \u2018about 3 weeks\u2019. True story :)",
