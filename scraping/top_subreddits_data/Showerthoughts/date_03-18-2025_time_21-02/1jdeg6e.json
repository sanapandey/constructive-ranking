I've experienced it numerous times over the years but its hard to put into words as its a state beyond thoughts and words:  -except to say that it feels a more real and down to earth state of awareness than 'normal' everyday waking.  \n This is my experience of it anyway.\n\nPS: I found this....\n\n*'Lucid Dreaming and Conscious Awareness'*\n\n\"Lucid dreaming, a state in which the dreamer becomes aware that they are dreaming and may even gain control over the dream narrative, provides a unique window into the relationship between sleep and consciousness. This phenomenon has garnered significant attention from researchers and practitioners alike, as **it blurs the lines between dreaming and waking consciousness** .   \n  \nLucid dreamers often report heightened levels of self-awareness and cognitive functioning, allowing them to engage in activities that would be impossible in waking life, such as flying or exploring fantastical landscapes\".\n\n[https://transpersonal-psychology.iresearchnet.com/states-of-consciousness/the-science-of-sleep-and-consciousness/](https://transpersonal-psychology.iresearchnet.com/states-of-consciousness/the-science-of-sleep-and-consciousness/)",

But only recently \u2013 in the last few months, really \u2013 I have noticed that if I do this breathing technique I fall asleep rather consistently. It's the one where you breathe in through your nose as deep as you can while you count to a number \u2013 the number five works well for me. Then hold your breath for that same count (of five) and then exhale through pursed lips (to slow the flow of air down) while you count to double your number (10, in my case). It REALLY. seems to work well if you can sense your heartbeat and count at the same tempo. Yeah\u2026 I guess it is. kind of like counting sheep but I find I only have to do it a few times 10 times or less probably and then I consciously just eliminate the hold of breath part and breathe deeply in through my nose out of my mouth \u2013 at about the same pace, but without counting anything \u2013 and before I know what's going on. I'm asleep. I can't believe it took this long to figure this out, but it's nice to know I'm not the only one with the problem. I sincerely hope this might work for some of you.

Your reality starts mixing with your dreams, and you start seeing dreams whilst also feeling your body.\n\nThe part where you\u2019re almost 100% asleep is the craziest one because it is basically impossible to move your body, but you can still *feel* your body. I\u2019d describe the last part of falling asleep as a nice sleep paralysis.\n\nI\u2019ve also never thought about the fact I might be one of the only people in the world to go through falling asleep consciously",
