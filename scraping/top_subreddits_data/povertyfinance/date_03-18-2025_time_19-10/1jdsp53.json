I feel more loved here than i ever have. \nI am already in my local Buy Nothing group and we plan on doing thrift shops as well! \n\nI have a lot of calls to make tomorrow because of the numerous comments here with other resources i didnt know existed!! \n\nI will for sure update again once we get into the place. We get keys and sign lease tomorrow (Tuesday) tjen move in Wednesday because thats the soonest Delmarva (my electric co) can turn on the power. I cant wait to share everything. I hope to never experience this kind of low again. I know it will be tough with new challenges now but this will work. It has to. \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\n\nDue to a horrible divorce a few years ago, my kids and i have been living in a motel. I work full time, dont quailfy for food stamps, paying an insane amount of rent and car payments, and kids with medical issues  etc made it impossible to find a rental. There was no way to save for the moving cost and down payments etc. BUT. Finally.  We found a rental. A realtor who owns a property.  Its small, but perfect. My kids can stay in their schools, its close to my work. And its less than this motel room!\n\nI inquired about it and thankfully he has a heart and was willing to give me a much needed chance to prove im a good tenant who pays rent on time and im quiet. I dont party. I work, take care of my kids, sleep, then work again. (And im ok with that! My ideal Saturday night is jammies and movies with my babies and a Wednesday sandwhich picnic blowing bubbles etc)\n\nWe move in 2 days. I havent stopped crying. We have nothing to move with but we are finally moving up. It will all come in time. No furniture,  just our clothes. But its happening. Its finally really happening. ",

Every night he would grab a book like treasure island and read us a few chapters every night. It was honestly some of my best memories. You don't need stuff, you just need to be a good dad. Also, in you can visit a food pantry so you can get some free food. That way you can put that money towards savings and furniture. Keep an eye open for stuff for free stuff on Facebook marketplace to help furnish your new apartment. Congratulations by the way.",

                                    "body": "We had sleeping bags on the floor, after my parent\u2019s divorce as well. My mom \u201csplurged\u201d that first Christmas and bought bean bags. She worked swing shift so she relied heavily on the neighbors and folks from her work (thank you to all the grandmas and grandpas that helped raise me.) I still remember my mom helping make construction paper chains to decorate for the holidays, teaching us to  save seeds and how to grow our own vegetables in egg cartons and taking us camping. I didn\u2019t realize at the time, we camped in a borrowed tent and had borrowed fishing poles at a park because we couldn\u2019t afford vacations, but those memories are still some of my best moments. She instilled a love of nature, hiking, paddling, camping, gardening, rock identifying, stargazing, cloud watching and foraging in me at a very young age because she was trying to distract us from what we didn\u2019t have. \n\nI recently told her that as I\u2019ve grown, I realized how close we were to living out of the car but somehow she turned the stressful and scary moments into amazing memories for me. I don\u2019t think about what I didn\u2019t grow up with because I grew up with a loving parent who showed up even when she couldn\u2019t be there physically and that was more than what many of my childhood friends had even with two parents.\n\n\nEdit: THANK YOU!! My first award(s)!! My mom doesn\u2019t use Reddit but I\u2019ll definitely share your comments with her. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be tearing up over some of the responses and I\u2019ll be honest, I know my mom would reach out and hug every single one of you for the kind words.",

She had also collected some herself and told me this was going to help so many people. \n\nOP, definitely join Nextdoor and ask if anyone has items,  NOT money, to donate.

THAT would make him a good human. THAT would really be helping you in this shit market. him just taking your money every month while hardly lifting a finger? it's just passive income to him, especially because he owns multiple homes. he is making MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS A YEAR. this could be your forever home for you and your children but greedy fucks like him would rather have people like you give him passive income for the rest of his scummy pathetic life.\n\n\npeople could be owning homes if it weren't for slimeballs like landlords. AGAIN, real happy for your tenancy, especially happy for your children, but it doesn't make him a good person for doing his fucking job. and the bare minimum at that. you don't need to pat him on the back and salivate over him for literally doing nothing, and it is honestly getting tiring seeing people do this about damn near everything, where they're praising to the heavens about how a shit company did the bare minimum and how amazing they are for it.\u00a0\n\n\ni know it was brutal being homeless but that is not a good reason to praise the devil. you don't need to sing him high praises, just appreciate the home you have instead. your landlord isn't paying your grocery bills, your rent, or your essentials. he is literally doing nothing except allowing you to stay at one of his many many MANY meal tickets. he most likely has all of those homes paid off so it is LITERALLY zero dollars he is paying on the homes minus obviously renovations or some fixing ups.",

Hotel living is the worst and I'm going to do every damn thing I can to never go back to it. I'd rather be in the street and if I didn't love my cats so damn much I would be. Literally everything I do is for these two ingrates and I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nSo congrats on your new place, enjoy the high, you've earned it.",

That way, if there's a particular *Freebie* that you might be in need, like \"dishes\" or a \"TV\", the app will send you *Alerts* to let you know. I hope it helps!",

I would ask them.. just need tape you can pickup at dollar tree.. you can pickup tons of stuff there to supply cheap at first.. silverware.. I would look at Facebook marketplace.. furniture is super cheap or even free.. furniture is so hard to sell you can easily haggle or you can post a message on local pages for your city and local cities around you place and tell them about your situation and ppl will help.. most people don't want to bother with their old furniture so if you want it they will be willing to give it to you.. again furniture is so hard to sell.. you can ask local ppl that go around to keep eye out for what ever furniture you're looking for.. most don't care about wood but they can call you if they find anything with the location.. ppl are always throwing out furniture. Eviction is another way to get free furniture most tenants don't want to bother with moving furniture if you talk to the landlord he might have some.. thing's like tv buy from market place you can get 40\" for like $30.. rarely can you get that for free. Most TV you can connect to a cheap computer and watch movies on it even play free games with emulators so you're kids can play.  The biggest thing is refrigerator need to be shipped up right or leave unplugged for like 5 hours before plugging in.. because of oil in the compressor.. clothing if all you have is a car trash bags are easier than boxes.. use boxes as bins for clothing storage for now.. that's the best advice I can tell you so far..",

My husband and I were able to buy a house last year in North Wilmington for 220k which is insanely low for the area\u2014yeah, it's tiny, and sure, it's practically falling apart... but I'm working on it lol. \n\nThe public libraries are a great resource! Along with books/internet access they have movies, videogames, and museum passes you can rent, and a lot of free events for the kids. You could also download the Nextdoor app\u2014people around here are always giving stuff away on there. Same with the BuyNothing app! The Middletown Goodwill has great clothing options\u2014it's such an expensive area and all the rich people donate their nice clothes there. They also have decently priced furniture!\n\nAnd if there's anything specific you need/want I might able able to help out. SAHM here, so I have plenty of time on my hands. Feel free to message me. I wish you the best of luck! \ud83e\ude77",

I work at our local humane society and we love when families come in and volunteer with the animals! We also have a program where children can come in and read a story to one of the cats or dogs. The animals need social interaction in a big way and children usually take to the feeding and care of the animals really well. It's just a thought.",
