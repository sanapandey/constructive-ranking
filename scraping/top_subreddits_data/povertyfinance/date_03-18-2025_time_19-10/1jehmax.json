    "selftext": "Hi! Sorry, this is a rant. I feel like i have no more options i can't see a way out and i needed a place to put my thoughts and feelings out through writing. Please ignore grammar errors my phone is crazy and i just let the thoughts out as i was having it:\n\nI'm tired that life just constantly sucks. There is no opportunity for people like us, there is no chance to build wealth or leave the poverty/class we are born in. For context: you could say i'm lucky or unlucky depending on your view. I'm 30. I started working at 16 as part time and at 18 as a full time. I have been working so hard for the past years. You could say I've 'gone up' several steps - I managed to move to a better country and managed to do university for free with scholarship. I learned 2 other languages. I am 'blessed' to have now worked in my area of graduation for 9 years. Technically you could say it's all great and i worked hard but i can't stop thinking why I'm still poor? Why is life still hard. I did the work, i studied, i worked hard, i had 'luck' and opportunities, but i still can't get to on the green. I struggle to pay my bills, and trust me when i say i live FRUGALLY. Specially now that I've lost my job 4 months ago and haven't been able to find another since (before anyone judges - i didnt do anything wrong - just many redudancies to 'cut costs' of the multi millionaire company i was working for) So much dedication to have literally nothing. I'm managing to live off my savings exactly because i have been extremely frugal. But the money is disappearing quickly and i only have a couple months left until the money runs out. Cost of living is higher and higher each year, impossible to keep up. What even are my options if i continue to not find work? I can't drive and i live in a TINY town in the countryside (only place i could afford obviously) I just want peace of mind. Not this constant desperate overwhelming fear of possibly being homeless all the time. Also for extra context my family situation is also shit, i have no support and no one to count with. My bills are higher because i had to adopt my siblings who are much younger, there is no family. I literally don't need anything to live other than water food and a ceiling above my head. Can't get any benefits because i'm an immigrant (Despite popular belief, it's really hard to get a benefit in the uk, and even harder when you are a foreigner). I've tried everything: I am trying everything. Im doing art comissions, im making models and art for content creators, I have a sort of okay-ish youtube channel with 8k subscribers, but its all totalling in around 300 pounds a month which hello hello its barely my monthly groceries for 3 people. I'm also constantly fighting against feeling depressed because I don't even have the right to stop living when I have people I love that depend on me, trying to convert all the depression into pure rage against this insane society. I don't have more options, i'm trying everything that i can I don't see any more solutions. As a woman, it's starting to feel like the only way women can make a COMFORTABLE, rich life, is you by doing you know what. It's shit I hate the rich I hate this life and i see no way out. Terrified at what could happen next if i dont find a job asap.",
