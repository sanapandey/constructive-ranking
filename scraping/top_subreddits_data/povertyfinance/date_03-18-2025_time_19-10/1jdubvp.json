    "selftext": "I'm so sick of having to pay for literally everything. My partner's mother passed away suddenly last month. She had no savings, no life insurance, and a mountain of debt.\n\nWe had to pay to store her body while his family made the decision to cremate her. We then had to pay to transfer her to a morgue. We had to pay for a cardboard box to put her body in to cremate her. Funerals have expenses.\n\nNot to mention their house is about to be foreclosed on. We have to figure out something to do with him once the bank finally decides to take action.\n\nThen this morning my partner went to start laundry and our washer is broken. We live in an apartment, but we had to buy our washer and dryer because it only came with hookups. We had a warranty on them, but those expired like, 2 years ago. My partner spent almost 6 hours trying to fix it to no avail, and spilled a bunch of water on the carpet in the process. So he's going through it to say the least.\n\nMeanwhile we're both having pretty visual breakdowns because we know there's no money to fix this right now. I'm furiously searching local repair companies and their quotes to literally just LOOK at the damn thing is nearly $200. That's not including repairs.\n\nI'm so tired of not having money. Neither of us have jobs currently, but we are both actively looking and have been for 3 years now. I'm so tired of struggling and crying all the time because of it :(\n",

As a reminder to commenting users, \u201cVent/Rant\u201d posts are here to give our subscribers a safe place to vent their frustrations at an uncaring world to a supportive place of people who \u201cget it\u201d.  Vents do not need to be fair.  They do not need to be articulate.  They do not need to be factual.  They just need to be honest.\n\nUnlike most of the content on this subreddit, Vents should not be considered advice threads.  In most cases it is not appropriate to try to give the Submitter advice on their issue.  In no circumstances is it appropriate to tell them \u201cwhy they are wrong\u201d or to criticise them, their decisions, values, or anything else.  If there are aspects of their situation that they are able to directly address themselves, the submitter can always make a new thread with a different flair asking for help once they are ready to tackle the issue.\n\nVents are an emotional outlet, not an academic conversation.  Appropriate replies in these threads are offering support, sharing similar experiences/grievances, offering condolences, or simply letting the Submitter know that they were heard.\n\nAs always, if there are inappropriate comments please downvote them, REPORT them to the mods, and move on without responding to them.\n\nTo the Submitter, if you DO want discussion to be focused on resolving your situation, rather than supporting you emotionally, please change the flair of this post, and then report this comment so we can remove it.

If you're in extreme need, you can find something quickly doing a crappy job, but the job market is actually trash right now as if you have even a decent income its crazy hard to find a position that pays the same. \n\n3 years is a bit too long if they are actively looking, though. For my situation. I went from a pretty lucrative job to sending out tons and tons of applications to jobs in my field, out of those jobs, I got autodenied on a majority of them and had to eventually take a position with a very large paycut to try and stabalize my family. Shitty thing is that this company overhired, and the writing is on the wall that they are getting ready to cut, not even a year in. \n\nI've gone back to shooting out applications, and it's still an absolute mess. It took me 8 months of working a comission only sales job trying to find something viable just to be cut in an extremely short time, and that sucks. The market sucks, everything good has crazy competition right now, and the ai screeners are going wild. That being said, my dad went from being a cto of a company making multiple 6 figures to working at walmart for a year while he tried to find a position. If you're that deep in need, you find a way, and 3 years is too long.",
