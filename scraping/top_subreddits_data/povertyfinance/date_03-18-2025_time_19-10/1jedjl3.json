Even if I buy something for like $7.5k or so, at 10% APR for 18 months, I\u2019d be sitting at a $500 a month payment. Insurance would drop slightly, and I\u2019m currently on premium fuel. I don\u2019t have the cash. \n\nAdvice? ",

            "body": "If you need more cash flow you could potentially refinance your current car loan to stretch out the repayment time.  Normally that is a bad option as you risk extending your loan beyond the lifespan of your vehicle but with only 37k miles on your current car it should hopefully still be running good in 5-6 years.  Although interest rates for a refinance will be substantially higher than your current rate. With excellent credit and decent income you might be able to get something like a 6-8% rate for 60-72 months loan and drop your payment \\~$200 a month or so.\n\nIf you do this do shop around for the best rates & terms between your local credit unions & banks and online lenders as all loan applications you do within 14-30 days should be lumped together as a single hard inquiry on your credit.",

Different states have different options for children with special needs, but if your child needs a private school due to their special needs, you will want to look into seeing if there is funding available. Often there are scholarship programs too. I have a friend who worked at the private school her children went to so she could get a substantial discount (she got paid as well). If there's a legitimate need, you might want to clarify it here so others can chime in with ideas as well.",
