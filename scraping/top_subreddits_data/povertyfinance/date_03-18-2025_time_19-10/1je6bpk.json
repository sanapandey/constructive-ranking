    "selftext": "In 2016 I made 12.50 an hour and could save enough to invest hundreds in stocks or my IRA per month.\n\nIn 2025 I make $24 an hour and I literally have around $12 left each month in my checking account before my next pay check. No joke.\n\nI do not eat out. I don't buy new clothes. I don't have an insane car note (its paid off) nor an insane mortgage ($770/mo.) No credit card debt(I dont have a credit card I canceled them all because I'm too monkeybrained for them). My expenses each month are : gas, grocery store, mortage, home insurance, car insurance.. And usually once per month there is some random stupid bullshit expense but one that is necessay like doctor bill, car repair, etc.\n\nThis economy sucks big time. I cut my trash pickup (which was like $40/month) and literally cannot cut anything else. I take my trash to the dumpster at work because my boss lets me use it.\n\nAlso I have 2 kids. But i make too much for food stamps or welfare assistance. I want to cry every day\n\nIf the economy keeps going like this I'd imagine we're due for a big recession since by the looks of it, the only businesses getting my money in 2025 are the grocery store, the car repair, the doctor, and the gas station. I literally don't have money for any 'fun' spending whatsoever",

I make anywhere between $10-$35 per walk including tip. Little dog short walk gets less money than 2 big dogs for hour long walks. I\u2019m starting to get regulars and one of them even paid me to dog sit when they went away for the long weekend. \n\nI originally got this job for fun money to take my kids for fun stuff and maybe a trip but I find myself constantly dipping into this dog walking money to fund day to day expenses like groceries.",

Nice thing about the dog walking through rover is I can pick up jobs when I have time. The jobs are like 30mins to an hour. And I look for them closer to home so I don\u2019t have to travel far. The $10 walk I do is only 20mins because it\u2019s this super old little dog but it\u2019s close to home and they pay me to do it 3 times a week. Sometimes I even send my oldest to do the walk for me. \n\nIs that an option? Could your kids help out by doing some extra jobs around the neighborhood? Not sure how old yours are.

School was an afterthought\u2014my parents didn\u2019t see the point of education when there was so much work to be done.\n\nOne day, a teacher from a nearby town visited my village. She spoke to the children and their families, sharing stories of faraway places and amazing inventions that changed the world. I listened closely, feeling something stir in my heart. \u201cYou can learn,\u201d she told me, \u201cand with knowledge, you can build a better life.\u201d\n\nThat night, I couldn\u2019t sleep. My mind raced with the possibilities of what I could learn if I went to school. The next morning, I made a decision. I would go to school, even if it meant working harder.  However, my parents concerns about the farm's well being outweighed my yearning for education.  I guess that's where it all went wrong.  Thanks Obama.",

I live close to work so I'm fortunate in that it's an option for me, but my miles are down to under 200 a month (I'll still drive in poor weather to work, unexpected needed trip etc) and my car related costs for insurance, gas, repairs, tolls went down considerably. I know not everyone can do it especially in America here where our infrastructure is shit, but if possible try to cut down on car trips and replace them with bike or transit or walking it really does help. Look at subs like /r/fuckcars /r/bikecommuting /r/ebikes and your local city might have a cycling or transit sub or forum.\u00a0\n\n\nAgain this sadly can't work for everyone like someone in Baton Rouge this isn't as helpful, but say someone in Minneapolis or LA or even Houston this can be a gamechanger.",

So let\u2019s evaluate this again. \n\n$100-clothes\n$400- utilities\n$275- insurance\nMedical expenses (deductibles)-$50 (at minimum this is extraordinarily conservative for 3 people)\nCar upkeep: quick google search says for a used car expect about $2000/year for repairs and upkeep on average. $165/month\nHome upkeep: (quick google search says 1-4% of the cost of home) $770 mortgage tells me maybe it\u2019s a $120,000 home roughly. That\u2019s $2400/year and $200/month. \nGrand total of unaccounted for expense: $1140\nLeaving about $40. HOWEVER I doubt she takes home this much bc I also make more than her and take home less.

And same for utilities - op should just say what they pay. Every once in a while you get the person who posts their budget and they're got a $500/month water bill that they thought was normal bc they have a running toilet or someone spending $200/month on their phone bill bc they think you just walk into verizon and get what they tell you. Just better to have the details to be able to see if there's anything they're missing.   \nAnyways in our home we do finances jointly so that we both know what's going on and whether we have it in the budget to do something if we can't consult with each other in the moment, but we're both contributing 9% to retirement, have a fully funded emergency fund, paid off cars, saving for college, etc, budgeting for groceries, clothes, housing, etc. for a variable number of people (Again, fostering).
