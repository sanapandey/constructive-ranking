I\u2019m giving my all and it just feels like no matter what I do, I\u2019ll never be free financially. I haven\u2019t told any of my friends about what\u2019s happening and it feels super heavy on me each day. Anybody else feel this way? Any words of encouragement to not feel as anxious or ashamed about my situation? ",

As a reminder to commenting users, \u201cVent/Rant\u201d posts are here to give our subscribers a safe place to vent their frustrations at an uncaring world to a supportive place of people who \u201cget it\u201d.  Vents do not need to be fair.  They do not need to be articulate.  They do not need to be factual.  They just need to be honest.\n\nUnlike most of the content on this subreddit, Vents should not be considered advice threads.  In most cases it is not appropriate to try to give the Submitter advice on their issue.  In no circumstances is it appropriate to tell them \u201cwhy they are wrong\u201d or to criticise them, their decisions, values, or anything else.  If there are aspects of their situation that they are able to directly address themselves, the submitter can always make a new thread with a different flair asking for help once they are ready to tackle the issue.\n\nVents are an emotional outlet, not an academic conversation.  Appropriate replies in these threads are offering support, sharing similar experiences/grievances, offering condolences, or simply letting the Submitter know that they were heard.\n\nAs always, if there are inappropriate comments please downvote them, REPORT them to the mods, and move on without responding to them.\n\nTo the Submitter, if you DO want discussion to be focused on resolving your situation, rather than supporting you emotionally, please change the flair of this post, and then report this comment so we can remove it.  Thank you.\nThank you all for being a part of this great financial advice and emotional support community!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Since you tagged it as such some may feel reluctant to provide any advice or constructive criticism. I'd love too hear more of your story and see what helpful ideas this community might be able to provide but more people will probably give feed back if you make another post and use a different \"flair\". I could be wrong. I've seen some pretty strict sub reddits before. But you aren't alone and people here for the most part know what its like and want to help.",

This post is more venting because it\u2019s just hard to take on these transitions and live life when I\u2019m feeling so lonely and anxious about everything! It\u2019s hard to see progress even if it\u2019s there, and it\u2019s hard to stay motivated within it all. Thank you for your kind words.",

And now I\u2019m going through the aftermaths of that career. My advice to you is GTFO of being an educator. If you\u2019re not a professor teaching at a uni IT IS NOT F WORTH IT. Don\u2019t get stuck there. Obviously you are struggling financially if you\u2019re working two jobs. Obv. You are not happy with where you are in life. Study something else, apply to other jobs that you don\u2019t qualify for- you might get a shot. But for the love of god leave the teaching job. I left my teaching job this past summer and now make $5 more working at a business office I had little experience for. I switched my career completely. There is no money in being a teacher or tutor. It\u2019s tough, it\u2019ll take some time, but get out or you\u2019re stuck in this endless cycle of  needing money and being tied to a job that doesn\u2019t cut it.",
