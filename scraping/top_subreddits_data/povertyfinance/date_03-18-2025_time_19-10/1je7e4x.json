Pinching pennies has never made me feel the need to splurge in reaction. But, given that debt is a huge weight on my shoulders, seeing that number improve the best it can is the best psychological relief I can buy.\n\nMeanwhile, my wife has ADHD and the severe impulse control issues that come with that. We still haven't totally found a solution there but it's clear that she's not really capable of just only buying essentials and your advice may apply more to her but isn't really a total solution (more of a slippery slope). \n\nI think it also comes down partly to what a person values in life. I like to develop apps/games, write, compose music, cook, work out, listen to music, watch educational videos, follow politics, etc. I don't really have to buy anything to enjoy these things as long as I have internet. (Some required buying something up front like a computer or instrument but I did that many many years ago and don't need to buy more). Even gaming, which I enjoy, is cheap or free because I still have every game I ever bought in my life so I don't realistically need to buy more to have thousands of hours more of entertainment. Defining my hobbies and interests this way that isn't really tied to spending money has meant that I don't really feel deprived. (Even though I would love to \"some day\" have more money to spend.) \n\nThat's in contrast to my wife whose hobbies are more about physical items and pop culture (which requires having access to new/popular things). To her, not being able to watch the new show everybody is streaming or not being able to buy a new decoration for some new work of art cake she is making are a bigger deal because those are the hobbies and interests she centers herself around. So for her, unlike me, never having any money does make hobbies and interests more challenging.",

I left a retail job for a civil service job at roughly the same salary, but that also had insurance, retirement, and paid leave. Not only am I in a MUCH more stable environment, I've also been given tons of opportunities for personal and professional growth. It was literally a lifesaver for me. I wouldn't get into federal civil service right now, but your state, county, and local towns / cities all have civil service positions in everything from HVAC to IT to public safety to custodial jobs. You name it.\n\nToday my wife and I are very well off financially, and I'm able to spend free time volunteering at my local food bank and one of the local no-cost health clinics. We're also to make considerable donations to local charities that matter to us.\n\nEDIT: Every time civil service comes up, some random Redditor will get irrationally angry and trip over himself to be the first to post \"heh but you can be fired from civil service anyway\". All I can say is if you think you've found some private sector job that will never ever go away, where you're guaranteed to never be fired or downsized, then go for it!",

Like, the MIL babysits occasionally but they're having to help her pay her rent and utilities, and they're giving rides to and from work to some bum-ass cousin, and so on and so forth.\n\nNone of us asked to be born and we certainly didn't deserve some of the families we got stuck with. Part of my maturity was realizing these people I had gotten stuck with had a pattern of behavior that always led them to ruin and accepting they would never love me enough to change any of their decisions. If there were ten of me, we couldn't have dragged them up out of poverty. And there's only one of me, so I chose myself.\n\nAnother factor I think is in play is that some folks on this sub have been conditioned to be the Unfavorite of the family and taught to people-please and be a caregiver in return for scraps of affection. They don't even see it because it's all they've ever known. Meanwhile, the family fuckups go in and out of jail, never hold a job, while the Unfavorite cleans up their messes and it's just expected as their lot in life.",

This is dad number 3.\n\nTbf, the first 3 were with someone who moved her away from her support system, promised to let her stay at home once he finished going back to school, then once he was finally making the money to do so after she worked 2 jobs to get him there, told her she's not even her own person anymore. That \"all she ever is, is a mom, not his partner\" when she stopped working, and did Everything at home. Then left for someone who made as much money as him. Now she's stuck in a HCOL area because he had the money for lawyers and she didn't. If she moved she'd  have to give up 50/50. She spiraled trying to make ends meet on her own and keeps making desperate choices to try and make these guys happy. I've tried to knock sense into her. This was my last, big push.",

His advice was probably good like 20-30 years ago, but now it\u2019s severely outdated.\n\nAlso, can\u2019t stand his car advice. You\u2019re not going to find a $1000 beater nowadays without serious issues unless you get lucky and a family member/friend offers that kind of deal to you. I also understand the position that a lot of people don\u2019t want their car to break down and miss work. I had a beater and spent *two hours* trying to make it to work one day\u2026 and my job was five minutes away. So I got a reliable car for 0% financing that was within my means and paid it off. How is having that kind of car payment bad? I understand that there\u2019s plenty of Americans with absolute dogshit car loans, but if you\u2019re smart about it and pick something sensible that you can pay off within 3 years or so and doesn\u2019t have horrid interest rates and isn\u2019t eating at too much of your paycheck every month, I would pick that over something with 300,000+ miles with a dodgy maintenance history. He\u2019ll berate people for having a car payment because he\u2019ll say they wanted something nice and shiny, but that\u2019s not always the case. Having a reliable vehicle means you can make it to work. I doubt he\u2019d keep someone at his company if their car was breaking down every other day.",

My husband and I used his inheritance to pay off our mobile home.  Then we sold it and used that money for a down-payment on a house.  Several years later, we sold that house for $100,000 more than we bought it for and used that money to put a large down payment on our current home.\n\nWe are careful to have a budget with certain goals in mind.  We are a one car family, and that car is 19 years old.  We rarely eat out, and scour store circulars for sales on groceries.  In return, we expect to be mortgage free before the end of this year.\n\nThat leaves us with ~$1,200 a year for homeowner's insurance, and $850 a year for property taxes.  And yes, we do know about maintenance and repair costs, but for us, it's still cheaper than renting.",

To put it another way: a lot of people that never had to be poor become and stay poor because they don't understand how to budget. \n\nThere are other people who are poor because a debt spiral already happened or because they simply do not have the ability to collect an income that matches their needs including (but not limited to) physical or mental health issues. These people cannot be saved merely by a budget.\n\nA lot of people perceive wealth growth as linear. That having $10k more net worth is equally easy each time. But it's not. When you cross that $0 mark from debt to savings you go from compound interest working against you to it working for you. You go from being charged for your poverty to having your money work for itself. A lot of people who have been in debt long enough forget how tranformative this is. Yes you're not guaranteed to be saved and things can still go wrong. But having the momentum shift from being against you to with you is huge. And in that context sometimes the difference between being $50 in the red each month and $50 in the black each month can be life changing. And in that sense budgeting can be a lot more powerful than just saving the amount your budget saves. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn these cases it's really easy for debt to snowball.",

Also in a stagnating employment market making a career plan is a career dream for a lot of people. Not having children in the context of governments not teaching contraceptives and banning abortions is not placing the blame appropriately. You say move smarter but there\u2019s really only so much people can do. If you make 55k, are single, rent a 1 br, and have no kids, the only smart decision you can meaningfully make is how much you spend on rent and whether or not to invest. Both are decisions that could be out of your hands. Budgeting in this case is not a way out of your situation it\u2019s the only way to survive it without it getting worse. Thus, my post.",

Long story short, he works for the fed and got RIF\u2019d a few times in the early 90s and the last one in \u201894 had him transferred to another state and taking a 50% paycut. But when you get on priority placement and they cut your orders, you go. So we did (I was 6mo old). \n\nDrive the car until the tires fall off then put new tires on it and drive it some more, he says. If we (me and my brother) didn\u2019t take care of or broke a toy and dad couldn\u2019t fix it, we were SOL. We watched our parents take care of what they had and fix it when it broke and sometimes just go without. \n\nWe didn\u2019t have A/C for a few years when I was a teen because the unit broke (it was old) and my parents decided to save up instead of taking another bill they couldn\u2019t afford. So they got a few window units and made do. \n\nBoth parents drove old beat-up ass cars in the 90s that my dad kept fixing because it\u2019s what they could afford. Didn\u2019t get a new car until 2004 with careful budgeting because the old car was just done. And he drove *that* truck until the frame started to rot out in 2019. \n\nWe were not interested in keeping up with the Joneses. Because fuck them, actually.",

My hot take: if you're in a position where you're not buying food or paying rent because you have a medical bill or a credit card bill to pay, ignore the bills. At the end of the day, you need food and shelter to survive. When you have a laundry list of bills and expenses, prioritize those 2 things and you'll be better equipped to tackle the other things in the long run. \n\nRelated to that: Get every penny you can from things like WIC, food stamps, Medicaid/Medicare while you still can. Use the food bank. These programs are there for people in every type of situation - if they're not used, they go away. If it's a pride thing, use them when you have to and then give it back when you're able, kind of like a karma loan. \n\nTL:DR - I grew up poor and I always found that being poor was a little more manageable if you prioritize your basic needs over paying a credit card bill.",

There\u2019s plenty in poverty that do have good credit but they may not have the cash or make good wages which also makes getting loans hard. I do not own a 30k car. Why do you keep saying that? I\u2019ve never bought a new car in my life. It\u2019s not a beater as my husband needs reliable transportation to work and I can\u2019t remember how much it cost but it wasn\u2019t much. Under 11k I believe. We had to take a predatory loan though.  The original engine was gone on our 2005 Nissan Sentra. In 2020-something.  I bought that car used in 2007 with a good loan from a credit union. I actually can\u2019t even cook and bake. There\u2019s different levels of disability and if your Grandma wasn\u2019t reporting her income, it\u2019s illegal. I\u2019m disabled on many counts not just one. Don\u2019t pretend to know my life. I would work in anyway that I could to better my situation. There were times I had 4 jobs. I do not lack a work ethic.",

The people around you who seem to always have nothing or can always afford to go out to eat are just as broke as you are. Don't ever compare your financial positions to others unless you can see their bank statements. Also, there's never any harm in asking to get a fee reversed or to set up a payback plan if you need it! Worst we could say is no! And if you're talking to a local bank or credit union, trust me when I say they are looking for ways to make things happen for you and will be super forgiving wherever they reasonably can be.\n\nAlso, for the love of god, don't get a payday loan. No matter how badly you need it or how fast you can pay it back - don't do it. Even if you can get out of it quicky, the interest rates set you up to need more and more. It's a vicious cycle.\n\nEDIT: Branching off of my first paragraph, in general, you should not feel scared or ashamed to ask for help in any regard! You may have coworkers who have things to clear out of their pantry, a friend who will drive you to and from work, a family member who will babysit/pet sit, a neighbor who will let you do your laundry at their place, etc. If push really comes to shove and times get dark, you might know somebody who will let you sleep on their couch if you get evicted, someone who has a family member getting rid of a car, someone who will let you shower at their house - there is ZERO shame in your financial position or the reasons you got there. And, anybody who looks down on you for your circumstances is a horrible person themselves, so their opinion has no value.",

You will likely have to choose between some of them, than to over-extend yourself and thus forego security in any of them.\n\n* More people who need to find fluidity are capable of sacrificing their cars than are willing to. It's probably the biggest financial boon to do so for those who can - they just choose not to.\n\n* Gig economy is a trap and a con. It literally costs you more in the long run than you can even make. That means it's the companies that make all the money facilitating gigs, which is a really, really cheap and efficient business operation.\n\n  I mean, do the math. How much do you make driving around transporting people and food? How much did it cost you in fuel? Tires? Oil? Maintenance? Replacement parts? Depreciation? Risk? The company owns all the things that make money, and you provide all the things that cost money. The earnings you make is little more than bait. It's better to not engage at all, in the first place.\n\n* You can't learn much from people who are in the same situation as you (though you can find support).

It's dubious that you would both be here and have a rig capable of mining. If you spend money on hardware, you'll never recoup the cost. If you spend money on the electricity, you'll never recoup the cost.\n\n  The biggest problem is you ARE engaging in a ponzi scheme; that means you're assuming MORE risk than betting on a horse - and I can assure you horse races are rigged more than you think. The point is, that ponzi scheme can crash and wipe out any unrealized wealth you kept in it. This is what gets most people. The other problem is most of these closed crypto platforms are controlled by their creator. Etherium? They have and continue to revoke sales that threaten the value of the crypto. They've even gone so far as to fork the coin to isolate 3rd party clients who amassed a controlling share, and they did it as a punishment to them.

And if your work is close enough, walk. get a bicycle. Carpool. Whatever you gotta do, but a car is making your life harder and more unafforabable. Get rid of it.\n\nThe other unpopular opinion is for people with kids. I see a lot of parents saying they're barely affording groceries and then the kid eats them out of house and home. Instead of letting them do that, sit down with them and discuss portions and how many snacks they're allowed to have per day. Instead of giving them access to a whole box of chips or cookies or whatever, keep one or two out for snacktime. Dont let them just mow through the entire refrigerator.",

I am planning a move and I will end up without a couch for possibly months and will be using a plastic dinner table, but it means I can get a smaller truck. I'll cruise the used market and save up for something I love more. And I've figured out some of my IKEA furniture is likely easier to sell here and buy again there, especially pieces I don't love. I even hate some of my current furniture, but I keep it because my brain tells me not to waste money if I already have something functional. \n\nOr stay in town and just move out further into rural areas if you have the transportation to commute. Longer drive but housing is often cheaper on the edges of cities or in small towns on the periphery. Multiple friends have done this the past few years. New larger rural houses often sell/rent for cheaper than smaller older houses in the middle of larger cities. I've had long commutes before. Listened to lots of podcasts and even language lessons.",

It might not be now but later when you get COPD or cancer or liver failure  and can\u2019t work and your family are having to make sacrifices to care for you and you\u2019re cranking up medical bills. \n\nI see it every single day. I\u2019m consoling that pack a day smoker that came in with abdominal pain and find out they have cancer. This person ignored the pain for months and by then the cancer was inoperable. The guy who drinks 5 beer a night whose liver is toast. The vaper who thought it was better than cigarettes who now had reduced lung capacity at 27 (but still keeps vaping).  The obese who need new hips and knees. It\u2019s because your body wasn\u2019t designed to carry so much weight. \n\nYour choices kill you. Stop making excuses.
