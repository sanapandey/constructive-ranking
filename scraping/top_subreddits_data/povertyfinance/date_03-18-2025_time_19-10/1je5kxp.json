    "selftext": "So I go to McDonalds once or twice a week (If I can afford to) to get a large Vanilla Iced Coffee because in my area you can get any size coffee for $1.99. It's way cheaper than anywhere else (besides doing it at home in the long run, i know, i know)...even from some gas stations! I also get an extra pump of vanilla for a 40 cent upcharge. This past week, they are running a promotion of any sized Iced Coffee for $1.79...sweet, 20 cent off!\n\n This morning I ordered my usual large Iced coffee with and extra pump of vanilla and do you know those dirty bastards raised the price of the extra pump of flavoring from 40 cent to 90 cent? Guess they had to make up for the \"promotion\" price somehow. Assholes....",

While a lot of the mixer things that I've seen it Ross are definitely sugar-free, I have 100% found standard vanilla syrup there. Ross sells a lot of overstock merchandise from other retailers, so it definitely would make sense that what they offer from one region to the next might differ a bit. As well as what they offer from one month to the next",

I store the simple syrup in the fridge in a short glass mason jar.\n\nOne cup sugar and one cup water. Bring to a very slow and low boil until the color starts to turn light brown and thickens. Maybe 5 - 7 minutes. Keep stirring. If you take your eye off it, it will over boil, make a mess and harden into hard candy. So go low and slow. Take it off the burner to add 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract or extract flavor of choice. No open flame. Some extracts have boozy alcohol. No fire starter here! \n\nNo added chemicals, stabilizers or artificial flavors. I bet you have both a 1 cup of sugar and a tablespoon of vanilla in the house. Maybe add a 1/2 dash of cinnamon and nutmeg during the Winter months. You can use organic sugar and/or extract, if you like. Enjoy! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nDuring the holiday, make a batch and put the simple syrup in pretty capped bottles from Micheal\u2019s, Dollar Tree or Hobby Lobby for your coffee drinking friends with a big bow. \u2615\ufe0f\ud83c\udf80",

(using points or promos but they werent as good towards the last few months i was actively going) anyways, yesterday i was working & wanted something quick (nothing around wouldve been ready to eat and/or have a bathroom) and the fries are like $4??? insane. i walked out. \n\ni shop at aldi for groceries & make sure to get enough snacks for the road so i dont feel the need to buy fast food. other expenses take priority sometimes so thats why yesterday happened, overall aldi has been great for affordable groceries for my partner & i and they have some pretty good selections for taste, dietary restrictions, etc. doing instacart put me on & ive also seen that food lion is pretty affordable too.\n\nin conclusion, mcdonalds can suck many eggs.",
