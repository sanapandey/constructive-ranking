    "selftext": "When I signed up for prime in like 2012 it was a financially smart move. I got a lot of things from Amazon back then, and it saved me money. Plus, I live in Hawaii, and there was always a shipping cost back then. \n\nNow, I wonder if it even matters? Seems like prices are the same, and any delay in shipping at this point is negligible because it is never necessities I buy off there. I go to Costco for that. \n\nI do have the Amazon CC, and that has no fee with prime. \n\nSome advice on this service and it's actual benefits would be amazingly helpful to my year. ",

Shipping can still be free, but only after a certain threshold. $35 I think. \n\nI've saved money since cancelling for sure.",

Less clutter in the house too.\n\nNearly all those previous purchases are things I could have done without and are now just sitting collecting dust.",

Now that they're doing ads in their Prime Video, it's no longer worth it to me. \n\nTheir shipping time estimates are always off these days, so keeping it for shipping speed isn't worth it either, IMO. Like you pointed out, it's still free if you hit a particular number - and with cost increases, $35 isn't exactly difficult to hit. And that's on the entire order, so as long as you don't just 1-click order everything, you're golden. \n\nI just figure out what I need, put it in the cart, and maybe once a month hit order after I verify I still \"need\" the things in the cart. Stuff like vacuum bags, books, etc.",
