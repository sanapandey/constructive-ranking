    "selftext": "I just picked up the phone without realizing it was a collections agency. This is my first time ever having to deal with this and im stressed. Long story short I owe a little over $6,000 on my credit card. I'm 26 and I'm so far behind on so many bills my credit score has tanked over 300 points just in the last 6 months. I'm so fucking stressed and scared and not sure what to do. I ended the phone call quick by saying I'm busy working right now. They told me a quick rundown about \"figuring out the best way to settle this debt\" and that i could be in legal trouble if i dont get it taken care of.They said they'd call back Saturday please help.

            "body": "When they call again, ask them about debt discharge options. Often, collection agencies will negotiate with you to reduce the overall amount you owe. For example, they may be willing to accept $4000 (with a payment plan) instead of the full $6000. Discharging debt this way will hurt your credit, but in the long run, it is less expensive to pay off and your credit will rebound as long as you make the payments. Good luck.",
