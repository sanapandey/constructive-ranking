Most recently I was somewhere for close to 2 years and I would have stayed forever but it was a nonprofit that couldn't give raises or even cost of living adjustments and I just couldn't afford to go another year without a wage increase. I've been in my current position for almost a year and it was a 20% pay jump. I've never gotten more than a 3% COLA in any position, and that just keeps your spending power the same year over year with standard inflation. If you don't job hop, if you don't get a COLA, you lose. Even if you get a COLA, you lose after a couple of years. Loyalty is not rewarded and unless you're comfortable at your current spending power then COLA's just keep your potential to earn more somewhere else higher.",

THEN I got my CDL, and am now a bus driver.\n\nI went from state minimum (which was 15 at the time in MA), to then making 18.50, to now making 24 for permanent routes, and 28 for charters, which is like field trips and stuff, extra work. also with my CDL, I now have a Roth IRA 401k, so retirement is now being set up. I'm 25 years old\n\nnot only have I climbed the ranks at this job, but I've collected a skill set and licensing that can be applied to different jobs for more money. class B commercial drivers on average in my area make 35+/h, i could easily find a better job if my expenses get more demanding or whatever. I could be a mail and package driver for USPS, is could work for Amazon, FedEx, or UPS, I could drive a trash truck, theres so many other things I could do with my skills\n\nso yea, pick a job, climb the ranks at that company, and collect a skillet that can be indefinitely applied to other fields, all with the name of job security.",
