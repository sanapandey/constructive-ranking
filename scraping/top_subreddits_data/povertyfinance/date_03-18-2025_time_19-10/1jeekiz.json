    "selftext": " I've been trying to be more optimistic about life and find God through my last suicide attempt. But nothing gets easier. I'm all alone. Carrying all this pressure and shit on me while not being able to control my body like I used to. I can't physically walk very far. I have 2 blood clots and I'm awaiting surgery that I finally got scheduled for on the 30th of this month. I went from 168 to 125 pounds in the last couple of months and my doctor told me it's frightening, but I can't really do shit about it. I do surveys for a little bit of extra money for food but it doesn't help all that much. I only qualify for $40 per month EBT, even though I got my job to take me off of payroll. And I can't count on disability to help me right now. I'm forever grateful to God that my surgery is back on again and hopefully I'm able to beat this heath setback and recover by late next month.\n\nI had a court hearing already for not paying rent, and they told me to be off the property by 12 AM on the 21st. I thought that my unemployment would at least start by now. I can't even walk far without everting myself. And have coughed up blood the last 3 times I tried. I was took to the ER last week because I thought I was dying. I can't keep living like this. I'm damn near starving everyday. And get nothing but bad news about when I'm finally going to get some assistance. They wanted me to buy a wheel chair for when I have to walk or take the bus, but I couldn't even afford that. I posted here before about this. Everything's gotten 10 times worse. I talked to my landlord. And don't even owe a lot, but there's nothing I can do besides pay. I at least want to keep my home. I have nothing else. I can try and find a way for other things, but this wait for disability, my unemployment, and my taxes are killing me right now. It's really hard to keep sanity. I need any advice because I'm looking at a more fucked up situation than I first thought. I'm scared shitless right now trying to hold onto any hope. And encouragement would help too. I'm getting suicidal thoughts and I thought I was done with them. ",
