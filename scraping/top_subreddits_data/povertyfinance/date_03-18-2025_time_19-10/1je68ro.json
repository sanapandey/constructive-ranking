    "selftext": "Sold my car last week to my moms friend for $410 (he said he give me $90 later) and was pretty happy. I put the money in my dresser drawer since it was like 3 am when they woke me up to do this. A few days later it's still in the drawer, I figured cool I'll use it towards my portion of rent and deposit it my next day off. \n\nToday I go to grab it and it's missing... I've searched the whole house, my car, my dirty clothes, everywhere... I've been crying for hours. I don't want to accuse anyone in my house of stealing it, but I don't usually misplace money. I always return found money as well! I found $50 in the break room at work and took it to the receptionist. Someone left their wallet in my car, I returned it next morning undisturbed. I'd feel better if it was bad karma! Either way, this sucks. ",

That sock drawer isn't FDIC insured.\n\n> Today I go to grab it and it's missing... I've searched the whole house, my car, my dirty clothes, everywhere...\n\nYou were stolen from. In your house. By someone you live with. Plain and simple.\n\n> I don't want to accuse anyone in my house of stealing it, but I don't usually misplace money.\n\nOh fuck you, stop this shit. You were stolen from, plain and simple!\n\nThis is not at all normal behavior, and I've seen it before. You've been gaslighted, probably your whole life. You doubt yourself, your sanity, your grip on reality. For the rest of us, this behavior of yours is frustrating to watch.\n\nIt's straight-fucking-forward. You put it in your drawer, and that's where it was. No, you didn't fucking drop it in the toilet. It was there, now it's not. Come off it.\n\nThat means someone in your house is a dirty fucking rat who thinks you're a stupid piece of shit, not anything more than someone who can be stolen from. They have zero regard for you.\n\n> I found $50 in the break room at work and took it to the receptionist. Someone left their wallet in my car, I returned it next morning undisturbed. I'd feel better if it was bad karma!\n\nYeah, your openly good conscious is easy to exploit. You're a mark. Whoever did it, they KNOW you don't want to accuse anyone.\n\n> Either way, this sucks.\n\nI hope you learn your fucking lesson and put a wad like that in a bank.\n\n> I figured cool I'll use it towards my portion of rent...\n\nI'd tell everyone in the house your rent was deposited in the pocket of a thief, that you consider the matter of your portion of the rent settled, and that it's up to the thief to cover your portion this month, since they have it.\n\nLet the roommates eat each other.",
