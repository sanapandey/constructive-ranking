    "selftext": "I made a dumb decision of buying a car with 20 percent interest. I got diagnosed with brain cancer. My parents offered me to move back home with them. I\u2019ll be doing that and focus on getting healthy. In terms of getting sued my parents live in Pennsylvania(can\u2019t garnish wages) and my income will be extremely limited in the next year or so. \n\n\nNow in terms of the car I\u2019m 13k underwater. The ironic part about this is that my credit is average(mid 600s) I qualify for new car loans at 7% interest but I can\u2019t qualify for a personal loan to cover the difference. \n\n\nDoesn\u2019t really matter. I\u2019ll be living in the city with my parents so I\u2019ll be taking the train and bus. ",
