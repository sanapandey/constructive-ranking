    "selftext": "Hello preface by saying I work in tech and so i am terrified that most these debt relief ads are scams. I've even gotten into phone discussions with representatives and then gotten paranoid that I don't know what I'm doing and getting into more debt. \n\nRecently I went to my partner for help but they were critical of my past mistakes so I couldn't handle the discussion without feeling attacked (me problem)\n\nI am looking for reputable resources for cc consolation and lowering my interest rate. I have two accounts both at 5k and all my spending cash is going to minimums. Thanks in advance friends\n\nEDIT:typo",
