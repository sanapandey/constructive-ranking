Not ideal, i know. they originally wanted me to pay 3k a month, got it lowered to 2,100 and then lowered to 1,912 a month. that\u2019s outside of my range to be able to pay. I work two jobs and do 13-14 hour days and with the student loans and other bills i\u2019m breaking even (not including gas/food). i\u2019ve been in a grace period but that ends in may.\n\nwhat options do I have to get some help in lowering it? i can pay $1500, but sallie mae is saying i don\u2019t have any other options until it\u2019s time to pay up. they said to pay what I can and then they may have more options then, but wouldn\u2019t give me any information on those options.",

I have about 30k myself and am in a similar boat where I need to start paying in it in July. I have several smaller loans so I\u2019m looking into consolidation.",
