    "selftext": "I have an autoimmune disease that absolutely wrecked my teeth over the past decade (dry mouth, which I now have managed). I've spent around $30,000 in that time, basically just putting out fires. I've had dozens of fillings, five root canals, two crowns, one extraction (plus my wisdom teeth). \n\nI went to a few different specialists this year for consultations, and two general dentists as well and they all said I should crown all my teeth. My gums are healthy, my roots are healthy -- but I've had so much work done to my teeth that they're more filling than tooth, and there is still a ton of decay.   \n  \nI was quoted $80,000 by one specialist, $50,000 by another and $38,000 by a dentist without experience in full mouth restorations. I'm in my 30's, so everyone I've talked to doesn't want to extract my teeth - especially because the roots are healthy. \n\nI've also looked into dental tourism -- I'm in Canada, but I found some promising clinics in Mexico that would cost $24,000 at the most for me and my partner to spend a two weeks at an all inclusive and get all that work done. But even that's SO much money, and I've read so many horror stories. One highly recommended place looked at my x-rays and told me I needed 15 root canals, which none of the dentists I've talked to here agree with (I might need a few though).  I'm terrified I'm going to spend that money and need a ton of fixes when I get back home, or no dentist here will be willing to touch my teeth if I need help. \n\nI put my name in with the local university, but even that seems so daunting -- they require you go to 3+ hour appointments a few times a week until they finish the process - probably 2-3 months. It's about an hour away from where I live, which adds to my anxiety. \n\nOn my good days constantly in mild-moderate pain, can't eat properly, and have to take ibuprofen constantly. I just feel so deeply depressed and hopeless about my options, and for any hope of improving this. I've had a crown fail and need an extraction in the past and so I'm picturing that happening to all my crowns after I spend tens of thousands of dollars. \n\nIf anyone has been through anything like this and found some light at the end of the awful dental tunnel please let me know, or if you're currently going through it. \n\n ",

Yes, dentists will try to point you a different way as they would prefer to save the teeth or replace them with implants but unfortunately that ideal treatment plan is often cost prohibitive. I have multiple relatives had full dentures in their 20s & 30s because it was the only workable option.",

Long-term your jaw will shrink a bit and you may have extra wrinkles on your face as the skin sags.\n\nImplants can avoid most of that but are easily 5-10X the cost. Might have to consider the health impact of all the stress, overtime hours, and other sacrifices required to pay that big amount compared to other ways you could use the cost difference to make yourself healthy in other ways. Dentures plus money to spare for a better diet or gym membership, and maybe eventually in a decade or two fillers/botox to    tighten any facial sagging could be the better option for both health and finances.",

She also got quoted tens of thousands of dollars to have her mouth restored by private dentists.\n\nToday she got her first surgery done at a dental school in preparation for full dentures. It's going to cost less than half of what the private periodontist would have cost. The care is also very personalized. She basically had a team of dentists working in tandem to come up with a care plan. Because cost wasn't as much of a factor they were able to focus on the treatment that would be most likely to succeed instead of what she could afford",

It's her whole face. Not to mention she's so much happier and it shows.\n\nI so hope you can get them. \n\nI had the option of getting a root canal and crown or having a tooth pulled. My insurance covered an extraction but not the root canal and crown.  I wanted to save the damn tooth. So I paid the $$$. A year later the crown and most of my tooth came out. The rest had to be extracted. Such a freaking waste. \n\nI think the smart and safer choice is dentures. Good luck!!",

Try to use a high fluoride content tooth paste. In UK we have Duraphat. Also just try to cut frequency of sugar down rather than amount of sugar. Hope you can find an answer that is affordable.",

We spent thousands of dollars, but it always felt like a temporary solution.\n\nEventually, she was told she needed a full-mouth restoration with implants and everithing, but the prices in the U.S. were just insane. We started looking into other options until a friend of her recomended a place in Colombia. At first, I was very hesitant about her going abroad for it, but after doing some research, she convinced me and she decided to go for it. Sadly I coulden't travel with her but luckly everything went great.\n\nShe got the All-on-4, and it completely changed her life. The quality of care was incredible, and the team made the entire process so easy. I think she ended up paying like 12,000 usd including the hotel stay and evrything.\n\nI know how overwhelming this all feels, but I promise there\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel.
