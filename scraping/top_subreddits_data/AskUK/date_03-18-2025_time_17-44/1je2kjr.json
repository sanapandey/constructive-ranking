I'd be there in my black school trousers, doc martins, school shirt and bow tie looking like a sack of shit tied up with string.\n\nI was clumsy, oblivious and untrained. The highest praise I ever got was from an anonymous reviewer who described me as massively incompetent but enthusiastic.\n\nHighlights were\n\n* Putting a bottle of wine on the table and when asked \"are you going to pour it\" I looked at them baffled, replied \"no\" and walked off.\n\n* A customer asked me for a cloth. I returned with the nastiest rag from the kitchen unsure as why he wanted it. He became even more furious as it turned out I'd poured warm duck fat from a salver down the back of his neck as I took it away to the kitchen\n\n* Straining a corked bottle of wine with a green paper napkin, dying it green and then telling the customer that it was from New Zealand and that's why it was green",

Amazingly they were able to laugh it off.\n* Once I was serving a large group of Americans (about 8) and they were piling the (oddly thick) plates up on my arm. It got to a point where I couldn't keep my arm stable and could feel the plates tilting. A p\u00e2t\u00e9 dish slid off the top plate and down the back of a woman's neckline. They still left me a tip.\n* We were slammed on a Mother's Day and one table kept asking when their food would arrive. I said repeatedly it should be straight out. Issue is, I hadn't been asking the kitchen where it was because we were just unbelievably busy and one waiter just didn't turn up, and I was constantly being flagged down. Turns out after 45 minutes I realised the order I had plugged into the tills hadn't gone to the kitchen and I'd already thrown away the pad I was using. So I had to go back, tail between my legs, apologise, and re-take their order. They were not pleased.",

You aren't tasting the wine to check if it tastes to your liking or not, you are specifically tasting that it hasn't been corked i.e. been contaminated from the cork resulting in an unpleasant cardboard-y taste. Outside of that specific issue, if you don't like the taste of what you have ordered, too bad, that is on you.\n\nI was mortified recently when we were in a small restaurant and the table next to us kept sending back their natural wine because it had a \"little fizz.\" Yes it does! You ordered a natural wine ffs, they tend to do that! But no, the waitress was too embarrassed or lacked the knowledge to explain and the people at table kept getting more irate.",

We also had weird calling times, too, like 8am on a Saturday morning (we weren't allowed to call on Sundays/bank hols), or 5-8pm on weekday evenings. It was always great fun ringing people out of bed, interrupting their dinner, bothering them whilst they were putting the kids to bed, etc.\n\nOn top of that, this coincided with the global financial crisis of the late 2000's, early 2010's, and an alarming amount of customers couldn't distinguish between overpaid investment bankers and other city types that'd brought the industry to its knees, and bottom-rung retail banking employees (I was on \u00a316k...). The bank itself didn't help, by calling us 'account consultants', and insisting that we introduce ourselves using that title (we'd fail call audits if we didn't). Naturally, this led to a lot of confusion and upset from (rightfully) angry customers.\n\nThe icing on the cake towards the end of my time there was when the bank ran a **big** media campaign around customer security, with the unambiguous message that \"your bank will never call you\", even though that was **literally my fucking job**. This campaign was so 'successful' that it now made it much harder to get customers through security (essential in order to properly start a sales call), and guess who would take the full blame for not being persuasive enough, during these encounters?!\n\nFuck Barclays and the eagle it flew in on!",
