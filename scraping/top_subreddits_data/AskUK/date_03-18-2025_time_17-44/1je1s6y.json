    "selftext": "I had a particularly poor experience in a TGI Fridays last year and swore to never go back. It\u2019s widely expensive for crap food. I know it\u2019s in financial trouble and it\u2019s easy to see why. I had a better burger in Spoons and it was 1/3 of the price.\n\nAt weekend I went out for my niece\u2019s birthday, she wanted to go to Nando\u2019s. I used to think it was definitely one of the better chains, but the food was dry, small portions, still expensive. There\u2019s a knock off Nando\u2019s takeaway near me that is far superior and half the price.\n\nWhen did this happen? These places used to be a nice alternative to a proper restaurant but some fast food places offer better food.",

The traditional method involves breaking up and selling of the constituent parts. Typically, private equity \u201cpurchases\u201d a business via loans against the business itself. This means that the business now has to return at least the same profit whilst servicing these loans. This is not a model for strategic investment and long term growth. The model typically involves divesting from the business in a relatively short timeframe (minimising loan costs) but prolonging the period of disruption. Often this process involves setting up a number of individual companies, at least one of which, miraculously, ends up carrying almost all of the combined debt before falling into bankruptcy. \n\nIf, as some people do, you think of the owners of many businesses as being sharks, then private equity are the extra aggressive killer sharks on steroids.",

They're just prefabricated shells selling generic food with two members of staff and some token furnishings from the Morplan catalogue, some plastic plants, and a bit of music. I was in a Starbucks (appreciate they're not going out of business) recently and it was the first time I genuinely felt like I was actually being duped by a company. There was nothing to it. Literally it was just a box building, partitioned into a till, toilets, and cafe area, some cheap furniture, a mural on one wall, and a coffee machine. There was literally no further effort made at all, yet it was rammed.",

Place was absolutely empty. \n\nDespite this, they forgot to take my order, forgot to cook it and then forgot to bring it over. On three separate occasions I had to stand up, chase them down and be like \"uhhh you guys are serving food right? Can I have some\".\n\nAt this point I have to assume it's a data harvesting and asset-stripping venture and that they're no longer trying to sell food in return for money.",

There's a great book that touches on some of this stuff called No Logo by Naomi Klein. It talks about how businesses like that used to rely on the strength of their products or services to fuel their reputation and sales, but now that's all secondary to the massive amounts of effort that goes into branding and the \"brand lifestyle\" despite the actual products and services just getting worse and worse.",

It's not that I don't like the products, it's that they seem exceptionally poor quality and high price, their entire survival seems predicated on people not realising what a bad deal they're getting. \n\nMy old boss got a Mustang Mach E. It was riddled with faults, and it's a flabby Chinese crossover with no racing ability, it just has \"Mustang\" written on the back.

            "body": "I've found bigger restaurants are getting worse, but smaller ones are getting much better.\n\nBack in my youth, you either had nice high end restaurants, or local shitty places you'd go to chance food poisoning. If you wanted that in between, you'd go to say, McDonalds. Cheap, but quality tasting food. Now that's inverted some what. The local shitty places have turned into actually quite nice places, and because of food standards they've all turned into quite nice places to eat, with fantastic food, with reasonable prices. In comparison, because the chains are not competing at a local level they're just looking to raise profits across the board, they're still offering the same low quality food they were 10-20 years ago (if not worse quality) but dramatically raised prices, making it a no-brainer to never go there.\n\nMcDonalds is a prime example. It's toilet fodder. The point of it is low quality, cheap food. Now it's low quality expensive food. Fuck them. However, in it's place Burger King has swooped in to fill it's niche. It's not exactly *cheap* but the quality is far superior to McDonalds, making it the better option. These big chains are so focused on a global picture that they can't see they're being cannibalized from below by smaller players, and local businesses.\n\nAside from that, small joints like chicken places, kebabs, Indians, have really increased in quality. Shout out to Slim Chickens, quite genuinely the best KFC replacement there is. But even if they weren't the best, tonnes of smaller chicken places do KFC better than KFC do, because KFC have, like McDonalds gone down the low quality, high cost route.\n\nAnd because of Uber Eats, I know we gripe about how shite it is as a service, but it opens up such a large market for these places. Basically any large chain or franchise has a local knock-off that is way, way better. I only live in a small town and I'm spoilt for choice, I can't imagine what it's like in say, London. McDonalds? Burger now. KFC? Slim Chickens. Burger king? Gourmet Kings. Pizza Hut? Pizza Valley. Baskin-Robbins? Kaspas. Taco Bell? Mexican Now. Subway? Wrights. All of these are local alternatives for me to big chains, all of these are far superior in terms of quality, *and* cheaper. \n\nThis is true capitalist competitiveness in action. The big chain stores are busy enshittifying to save money. And this has left a niche for small local outfits to come in and take market share by offering a better product for cheaper or the same price. These food chain dragons are leaving themselves open to death by 1000 cuts. If people went local enough, these wankers would feel it enough to change.",

It isn't the best food, but it'll be OK where a random Italian might be great, or might be terrible. That's the value of most chain restaurants. There isn't a scale advantage, it's the brand reputation. But that also costs money because of management, national marketing etc. So Pizza Hut is no cheaper than a local pizzeria.\n\nOnce you get TripAdvisor or OpenTable, you can see the places that get consistently high scores. Pick from the top of the list and you're going to get at least a good meal. It destroys the value of chain restaurants. You can be a pub out in a village with zero marketing budget and people will come to you because of it, if you're really good.",

I said we\u2019re going to leave, she panicked and after speaking with someone, our food was almost ready. Came to our table a few minutes later. It was good to be fair but our appetite had gone.

Nando's isn't expensive at all. Half a chicken or a burger, with two sides, is like \u00a315. Where on earth are you getting an eat-in meal like that for \u00a37.50? Can barely get that takeaway from a chicken shop with 2-star hygiene rating.",

It's got great branding and it looks like it'll be fun but the food was never that great.\n\nAnd my other thing is, I believe Spoons are brilliantly run. It's all about packing the punters in, all day. A lot of the costs of a pub or restaurant are fixed. Rent, rates, heating, lighting, kitchen, decor, cleaning etc. Whether you sell 3 lunches or 30, those costs are the same. The only extra cost is the ingredients and that's normally around 1/4 of the cost of a meal. So, you take your margin down a bit, more people come to you. And what you lose in margin, you make up in volume.\n\nIf I'm travelling, it's my top choice. I know what I'm going to get and it's fine and cheap. I like the jacket + bean chilli and it comes with a soft drink for about \u00a36. I was in a town working and the nearest place to eat was the Spoons across the road, so I went over and on a Wednesday night it was really busy. If I went to any other pub on a Wednesday night it wouldn't be even half that busy.\n\nAnd think about things like how Spoons opens for breakfast. Does Nando's? No, they don't. So, part of all those fixed costs are covered by people popping in to get a fry up and a coffee. You're already paying for the building, why not open longer (I never understand cafes that open after 9am).",

So saving \u00a312 an hour on a server probably cost them \u00a360-80 off our bill alone.
