Their physical needs are met but emotional needs sit in the back burner unfortunately because there\u2019s so much to do in such a short time with limited staff.\u00a0\n\nAt our home there\u2019s entertainment but it\u2019s just basic crap like bingo, cards, music, drawing. Very very very rare they are taken out, some aren\u2019t taken out at all if they\u2019re deemed too difficult or their behaviour is challenging. I know for a solid fact a lot of care homes are the same, some worse.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of dark shit about care homes you don\u2019t know, it\u2019s all about money not people.\u00a0",

They have a fucking petting zoo..lol\n\nThere is a playground on the site, so when families visit the kids have somewhere to play. There are regular concerts, art exhibits, etc...it's a fucking paradise..\n\nIt costs 8k per month, but the staff are all well paid professionals. The building is new. There is a full time chef. A recent cleaner retried after 35 years. \n\nSome folks self pay, those that can. My mum can't, so the state pays. \n\nANd guess what? The company that runs the place, still makes a good profit. \n\nIt's a lie that care homes can't make money and not be decent. It's a choice bu the owners and the companies that run these places to extract the maximum amount of profit. \n\nI'll jump off a bridge before I 'll agree to go into a care home in the UK.",

I tried painting, chair yoga, tie dye, button mosaics, reminiscence. Never really felt that I got a handle on how to do the job, was delighted to leave it. It's ROUGH being a care assistant, and often dangerous for you & the ressies because there's not enough staff, equipment or time, but at least you know what you're supposed to be doing.

That's just for 3 residents, so it can be more depending on how many people and their needs (fluid charts, bowel charts, activities, food; different people will have different levels of documentation.)\n\nThere is a LOT of admin in care nowadays, which is good in the sense of more accountability and safeguarding, but it is very time consuming.\n\nHOWEVER, these staff seem like they're just taking the piss if they're sat about watching a whole film (not even with the residents?!)

If you are really unhappy with the home ( and self-funding), try visiting others to see how they compare. Not all homes will accept any patient though, they generally carry out an assessment to see if they think they will be able to meet their needs. There are good homes out there, though of course they are pretty expensive, and tend to retain the better carers. Nowhere is ever going to be as good as home, but, if the carers are treated reasonably, they tend to stay and build a rapport with patients. Caring is everything.",

We had to put my mum in care, she also had Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s and vascular dementia.\n\nThe first home was a dementia home, it was outstanding rated. Within the first week mum had a fall (she had many actually) and was left on the floor for 9 hours while they waited for an ambulance. Mum was very agitated and confused in this home, she didn\u2019t understand why she was there and she really didn\u2019t enjoy it. She started wandering into other rooms and poking people with her stick (\ud83d\ude05), and within a week the care home had declared they weren\u2019t able to care for her (she really wasn\u2019t that aggressive, so fuck knows what they do when they get someone who is). \n\nSo we moved her to another one, also \u2018outstanding\u2019, but not a specific dementia care home. We explained fully the current situation, we were extremely worried that the exact same thing would happen again. They reassured us that they\u2019d be able to cope. 2 weeks later we moved her again for the same reasons (by this point my sister and I were getting very annoyed at the care homes). \n\nFinally we found another one, 25 miles away but the only outstanding rated one left that looked decent. This one turned out to be a lifesaver. The staff were lovely, and a few of them really took a shine to mum. There was outside space, they organised activities and they\u2019d regularly take the residents on walks and trips. Food was ok, staff levels were adequate. She was there for a couple of years before she had a stroke and passed away a week later, in the care home. \n\nSo I guess one answer is be prepared to move him to another home. This is probably easier if self-funding (although all of these homes did accept council funding). It\u2019s incredibly stressful and not something to take lightly, but I\u2019m so pleased we moved mum. She had as dignified a time as possible in the circumstances and the carers were lovely. \n\nI don\u2019t know where you are but this was in Rugby. \n\nI would say also though that it does take some getting used to these places. They\u2019re not exactly the Ritz in general, and there are some very frail people there (obviously!). They tend to be understaffed (with underpaid workers), and they have a very difficult job to do. Maybe visit a couple more and compare them now that you\u2019ve got some experience of what one looks like. \n\nGood luck, it\u2019s not easy.",

Issue is they don\u2019t understand that it\u2019s dangerous to get up and walk about, they get bored or want something doing, so they try to do it and\u2026 \ud83e\udee0\n\nThey gave her a chair but she\u2019d just get out of it all the time. In a perfect world there\u2019d be someone with them 24/7, but it\u2019s just not financially possible. That sort of care costs extortionate amounts, so they just have to do their best. I had all the same concerns about trusting the carers etc, but to be totally fair I never once saw anything I found questionable (and I was there a lot, when they weren\u2019t expecting me sometimes as well). \n\nIt\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s \u2019normal\u2019 (I guess the point of your post really?) when you\u2019ve never dealt with it before, but looking back I\u2019d say you get a feeling when things aren\u2019t right. The first 2 homes mum was in were totally inadequate, but it\u2019s only with hindsight that it\u2019s so obvious.\n\nThey might struggle to provide all of the activities etc, and we found we had to keep on at them about things like toe nails and hair cuts (shouldn\u2019t be the case, but advocating for them really helps), but other than moving them to a different home or doing what you\u2019re doing now (visiting as much as you can) I don\u2019t know what else you can do.\n\nIt was undoubtedly one of the hardest things I\u2019ve had to deal with, and the final 2 weeks after the stroke were brutal and I hope I never have to do anything like it again, but it showed me that the care home staff did actually care (we all cried together more than once), and two of them even came to the funeral. \n\nIs the manager any good? We found the manager to be very helpful and approachable in our case. If we had issues she was happy to listen and try to address them. Makes a huge difference. If you\u2019re not happy with the care, they might be the person to talk to initially.",

What are they hiding",

You can get cameras that look like light bulbs or photo frames or whatever cheap online\nIt infuriates me how anybody can hurt somebody vulnerable.",
