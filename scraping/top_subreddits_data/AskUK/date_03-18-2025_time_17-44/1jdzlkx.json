Nude photos aren't illegal, we would give the negatives back and print everything else but just skip the individual \"offending\" photos at the printer. It just made for awkward encounters, like arguing with 2 very thick accented African guys who were super pissed that I couldn't print the 20+ photos of them tag teaming a hooker in Vegas.\n  \nThe last year I worked there, we got a fancy new Kodiak machine that would scan the negatives and burn them onto a Compact Disk. This technically didn't print them so the no nudes policy wasn't enforced. However, we would still need to go over the images of scans, since it had a high failure rate (the negative would often slip in the feeder and the scanned image would be the bar with half an image on each side, we'd would have to pull the feeder, re-set the negatives and resume the scans). One customer decided to drop off the film and then spend the entire 20-25 minutes standing there watching me work. He watched me the entire time I was pausing, fixing and resuming about 2 film rolls of people on a cruise-ship shitting on his wife's chest. This was 20 years ago and I can still see those pictures...",
