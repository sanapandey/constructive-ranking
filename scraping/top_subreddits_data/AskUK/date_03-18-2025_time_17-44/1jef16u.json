Is it merely stagnant, actively shrinking or actively improving?\n\nIs there a hesitancy of UK companies to train up junior employees, but stable for middle or upper members of staff? Or perhaps its difficult accross all levels of employees. Or perhaps its not as bad as others might think ",

Essentially the beginning of the year is usually slow, it's post Christmas, new year, it's budget setting time and planning for the quarter and year ahead, February and March usually pick up but right now employers are waiting for the NI rises to kick in and allow them to restructure for the new tax year. New budgets will need to be set to account for the increases, many places are on recruitment freezes or actively downsizing, and a lot of companies are just holding out until they can negotiate new contracts as the costs will get passed on from suppliers to customers and then to consumers. \nTrying not to drag politics into this one but yes, there is a lot of uncertainty holding back new positions right now, and it affects all levels of employment from first job as a barista to experienced managers. \nFebruary was the 31st consecutive month where the number of available jobs has decreased, if I understand the data correctly. 17 months for permanent positions. So yes, fewer jobs, more people.",

The 'unemployment rate' is a politicised metric (it is, naturally, politically useful to claim that the 'unemployment rate' went down over your premiership regardless of what might actually have happened; every party that has governed in basically the last century is guilty of this) and is not helpful for discussion because it counts underemployment as employment and does not count various types of unemployment as unemployment.\n\nYou probably won't find good answers here, either. The \"Reddit demographic\" in general tends to skew towards male tech workers, who 1) as men, benefit from the wage gap, and 2) (broadly speaking) as tech workers, earn more than the median. Given the mass USA tech company layoffs in the last year, sentiment began to trend more negative I think. Especially given that the UK is a common destination for USA tech companies' outsourcing. Many of these people have struggled to find new work. Then again, there are other fields which do not have enough qualified people and the average span of unemployment might be measured in weeks.\n\nThose who are unfortunately struggling will say they are struggling, and we'll also probably have more than a few 'I'm Fine Jack'-s.",

There are a general lack of jobs due to labours economic policy. It\u2019s really hammered businesses which has affected their ability and confidence in taking more staff on. \n\n4. When businesses moan about lack of staff, they often don\u2019t want to pay more.

Also, from p.15:\n\n>\\[D\\]emand for labour has slowed, which means the labour market loosened: job vacancies fell from their peak in 2022, and unemployment increased. The loosening labour market led to an easing of wage growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said in its October 2024 Economic and fiscal outlook that evidence suggests there has been a recent loosening of the labour market.\n\nIn this context, \"loosening\" means \"got worse\" and \"easing\" means \"decline\".\n\nWhat we're seeing is a massive distortion in the type and sector of vacancies. From what I can see, it's a great time to be a dentist, since there seem to be ads for those everywhere. \n\nBut it's a bad time to have anything to do with tech or operations that aren't construction-related.\n\nSince we're largely a service-based economy, that means a lot of skilled office workers can't find jobs, but niche specialists (eg dentists) and \"non-skilled\" workers (eg warehouse operative, Deliveroo drivers, etc.) can easily get work.\n\nThis is the result of Austerity after the Lehman brothers crash, was compounded by Covid, and is now being further compounded by global geopolitical insecurity, fears about AI, and increasing interest rates.",
