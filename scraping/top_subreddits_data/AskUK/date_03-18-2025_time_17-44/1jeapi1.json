In the work shop an angle grinder lead was resting on the ground connector for the welder,  it's uninsulated but had got hot and melted the grinder lead which livened up the digger.  It was while looking at that when I remembered by passing the RCD that covers the workshop and the breaker for the welder many years ago, I finished the work on the digger then ordered a new RCD and a couple of breakers for the workshop,  hopefully just having them will be enough because I don't remember actually fitting them.\n\nThe more recent one was work related,  a friend brought an oven over because it kept shocking them, I rewired it despite it not showing any  serious faults and it tested better but I wasn't convinced,  so I took it back to them and they cooked in it without issue,  later in the evening it shocked his wife, without anyone touching it it showed 150 volts that dropped to 70 immediately when you touched it and gradually dropped to 50ish,  then it suddenly went to nothing and stayed there, testing regularly over the next few hours showed nothing,  it was as I was leaving that as I hugged his wife we both got a massive shock at the front door!\n\nWe then spent a couple of hours theorising and testing all sorts of random things, it turned out to be cracked worn insulation on a central heating pump making the electrical bonding live, unfortunately the electrical bonding wasn't connected to the incoming earth but the earth rod was. Network power sorted the earth situation but did advise on the bakerlite switch gear and fuse holders.",

First was when we had the new bathroom fitted - fitters had removed the old light switches and replaced with a hang cord, but they hadn't disconnected the original wires. Feeling up the wall for the usual switch, not knowing they'd been removed I jabbed my finger on the end of the live wire which both broke the skin and then threw me across the room. Second time was unplugging a particularly stiff plug and my fingers went underneath it while it was still live - days before they coated the pins to prevent this from occurring.",
