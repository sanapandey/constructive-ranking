My manager sexually harassed me. I put in a grievance. I am being managed out in response.\n\nRealistically I have no choice but to resign as my health has taken a nose dive, my heart rate is constantly high etc. I have commenced the tribunal process (and have reported this to the police) but in the immediate term\u2026I\u2019m just stuck in a void. \n\nUnfortunately this was the only company I worked for post-graduation and I have been there for 5 years. I have reason to believe they will provide a poor reference given the legal dispute. So how do I even secure a new job? Do I keep this employer off my CV, knowing I will be unlikely to get another job on the same level if I do? What, if anything, do I tell prospective employers? This sort of thing floats around my head! \n\nIt\u2019s hard to see what\u2019s on the other side of this, and it would be good to hear from anyone who has experienced similar. \n\n",

I called her out on it one time in a meeting so she spent the next 12 months having my boss remove from projects and other workload.\n\nWhen I didn't respond to this, she started reporting me to HR for various things, \"tone of email\" was her favourite as it's really subjective and impossible to prove/disprove.\n\nAnyway, long story short, I took voluntary redundancy with a years salary payout and she was left 3 months later. \n\nSo I walked away laughing and took 18 months off living my best life.\n\nTook a step down in next job, but took about 6 months to surpass what i was on.\n\nDepending on company size put someone you like as reference. At a uni I put academic staff, not the management as my references. People I worked on projects with.\n\nDon't tell your potential employers why you leaving or  negative things about your job.

I argued with the senior management too much over policy changes and then became miraculous incompetent at my job after 15 years teaching.

One of these was a 45 minute drive over my lunch break.  I was also given two night school classes that ran till 9pm( no time back).  I walked out then I claimed constructive dismissal and won.\n\nThe constructive dismissal wasn\u2019t worth it, the union were weak and I only walked away with about \u00a310k plus holiday and stat pay.   The good news is I got a job at a different college working with decent people who appreciated my work.  I worked there for a number of years as a contractor then started my own business.  So yes it all worked out okay.  If they hadn\u2019t been cunts with me I would still be working there and really fucking miserable.

It was a scary move but was the best thing I ever did.\n\nIt\u2019s a really long story but I\u2019d been promised a promotion for years, when senior management decided to instead hire an external candidate instead. He became my line manager and he was nothing but a bully. But the real kick in the teeth was that I had to show him everything, and teach him how the department worked and how best to run it. I couldn\u2019t say no because I loved my job. \n\nTwo years after he started, I went on paternity leave, and returned to a mountain of work that nobody had kept up to. My manager hadn\u2019t done anything to help, and I was really struggling to catch up. He kept pulling me away from my work for unnecessary jobs, then complaining I was behind on my work and couldn\u2019t understand how.\n\nHe kept pulling me into the office and saying I was \u201caway with the fairies\u201d since coming back to work and I needed to snap out of it. \n\nThen it came out he\u2019d made some major fuck ups whilst I was on paternity leave, and brushed them under the carpet. He then continued to make further mistakes and pinned the blame on me. He ruined my working relationship with two other colleagues who thought I was throwing them under the bus, and became really awkward, whilst he was trying to get me disciplined and sacked.\n\nI was originally going to go work for a friend of mine just doing some part time delivery work to keep me ticking over, so handed my notice in. He had a nasty shock as he was expecting me to beg him for my job, and he became lost and didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nMy four week\u2019s notice was absolute bliss watching him struggle to actually do his job without me managing his department for him. Then my colleagues kept me posed after I left. About a month or two later he was found out as being the fraud he really was and further mistakes he\u2019d made. He was sacked himself",

One thing I will say is that employers in the UK cannot legally give poor references. In fact the vast majority of employers big enough to have a HR department only give a proforma reference that only says \"X workers for us between y and z in ABC role\". That is completely normally and won't raise eyebrows. If you come to believe your current employer isn't following the law or has tanked your reputation in a small field that can potentially be rolled into your law suit.\n\n\nIf you can stand to start looking for a new role without quitting you won't even have a gap in your employment history. If you do feel you need to quit you when talking to prospective new employers you could say that you needed to take on family caregiving responsibilities for a grandparent or took an opportunity to travel. These don't have to be true you just need to be able to account for the time without bad mouthing your current employer\u00a0",

At my worse I was in a situation was \"given' to a random team after a secondment ended. I made a mistake the first time I carried out a task, despite being under strict supervision, within my first two weeks in post. They never explained what had gone wrong and they stopped assigning me any meaningful work. I felt like a complete idiot, my mental and physical health plummeted. They didn't want me there and made that very clear.\u00a0I ultimately found myself a better job and never looked back.\u00a0\n\n\nWhile in the thick of it and couldn't see the way out I joined Toastmasters - the public speaking organisation. It was a lunch time group within my organisation, you'd speak for 2-3 mins on a subject and everyone would give proper constructive feedback. Everyone was lovely and positive. It really helped to boast my confidence. I would definitely look to get some positive interaction with normal, pleasant human beings to remind yourself what normal looks like.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nI hope things get better for you soon.

The director who was giving me shit has also been moved on to another department. \n\nLooking back it\u2019s clear I wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong and it was the director who was the problem, not me. My confidence took a knock for a while but now I\u2019m back to my old self again.\n\nBest wishes for the future op! Things can and will get better.",

I was young, naive, inexperienced, and new to the working world, so I agreed to start working without signing a contract, trusting the word of the 18yo son of a local mafioso (I wasn't aware of that at the time) who had been gifted the restaurant.\n\nAfter working every day for about a month to help prepare the restaurant for its opening, one of the managers suddenly told me that I hadn\u2019t been confirmed, despite having promised the opposite just a few days earlier. I wasn\u2019t paid a single cent, and I had spent my own money on petrol, safety shoes, and time working hard for nothing.\n\nI was devastated 18 years ago, and to this day, it still hurts.",

I quit before I was pushed and took a few weeks off on sick to collect my thoughts first (they can't continue with proceedings while you're off sick) \nUsed an old employer for a reference and went on from there. I told my new employer that the working environment became untenable after they had changed their kind about supporting me through a degree which was true.",

I ended up temping to get some income to cover my mortgage and taking in lodgers too. It wasn\u2019t ideal but I\u2019d say it was character building and I learnt so much temping as you tend to be thrown into jobs that you have to pick things up very quickly which rapidly expanded my skillset and ultimately has helped me grow as an employee.\n\nIt always sucks at the time but it never did me any huge harm in the long term\u2026.and to this day I still stand up for myself!!",

Many years ago I was being bullied and 2 people I thought were close to me knew about it. They lied and said they didn\u2019t know and effectively it was my word against the bully. I was a contractor and the bully was permanent so I was the one to leave. I felt wronged and it really affected me for a long time. 2 years ago both of those people connected with me and asked me if I had any jobs as they ended up back on the shop floor whereas I became a director in a big company. I politely sent them in the general recruitment direction which was a polite way of saying noway. In my industry it\u2019s all about who you know.\n\nYou won\u2019t get a bad reference. If you get asked why you left then simply say you are looking for something new. This will be an opportunity for you to pivot. You may have been knocked down. Get back up. The injustice won\u2019t feel fair and it isn\u2019t but you can push through it. Don\u2019t dwell on it and it will make you stronger.",
