Then I realised deleting isn\u2019t allowed so hopefully I don\u2019t get banned.\n\nCurrently we have a combined salary of \u00a34.9k and outgoings of approx \u00a32.4k (mortgage, car and so forth). \n\nIf we had a kid and my partner stopped working and her maternity leave finished (20 weeks), we\u2019ll be done to my wages only which is approx. \u00a33k a month. \n\nAfter bills that leaves us with \u00a3600 a month. On my last post it looked like we had \u00a32k left over when we have kids but it\u2019s actually \u00a3600. \n\nIs this the normal? Are we missing something? Do we just need to save so I don\u2019t need to do overtime for the next decade?\n\nA couple of you were really annoyed at having \u00a32k left over which isn\u2019t the case, my partner will obviously need to stop working as there is no one to look after the kid. \n\nWe\u2019d appreciate if people share their experiences as opposed to being sassy for no reason when it\u2019s a valid question.\n\nThanks",

I'm logged on from 7:45 to 17:30 with no mode the legal minimum of 20 minutes of break, which can't be pulled forwards because I need to drop the kiddo at nursery no earlier than 7:30 and can't go any more than 15 minutes later because he needs picking up before 18:00, then the evening is dominated by childcare until he sleeps and after which I'm about as useful as a chocolate teapot. He's not at nursery 4 days a week, but I still need to be logged off at 17:30 the other workdays anyway to make sure I can relieve my wife or the grandparent who's been looking after him, so there's not exactly a huge amount of flex.\n\nBasically, it's relentless, and it has to go *perfectly* every single day. Over 9h every single work day is exhausting in any job, whether the labour is physical, mental, social or otherwise, and unless you're more disciplined than me you'll inevitably suffer in your work performance because you'll spend a much larger proportion of your time clocked in just completely frazzled. \n\nHaving recently replaced some of my non-working days with annual leave instead of Flexi-time and experienced the 7:24-per-day life again, I think the middle ground of a 9-day fortnight at full hours is far superior to doing a full-time week in 4 days. Only 8 and a bit hours is glorious, and you still get a full work day a week to do anything. When our extra childcare hours kick in at the start of next year, we're both going to move to a 9-day fortnight and bounce the remaining day of childcare between the grandparents, two of whom are retired and one of the remainder is part-time. I'm very excited.",

Of course having one parent stay home isn't a \"bad thing\" either (as long as the child and parent aren't socially isolated). Either way, it's all about finding a balance and making your child's upbringing rounded and that can be achieved in many different ways. Would you object if the childcare was being provided by a family member (e.g. grandparents) rather than a nursery?

It's just a really common misconception I think a lot of people have, that being a parent means you have to be eternally selfless and self-sacrificing.\n\n I felt that way for a long time myself, feeling guilty if I handed my baby off to his grandparents (can count on 2 hands the number of sleepovers he's had in 9 months and it took a lot of persuading from my parents for me to recently accept him going once a month) or bought something impractical or unnecessary just for myself, and it is true in some regard; your life will never be the same if you choose to have children, you will have to miss out on some things, and people should absolutely be prepared for that, but it doesn't have to be years of making yourself miserable and counting the days til your youngest moves out so you can finally be free again. \n\nThere's a balance between working yourself into the ground to give your child the world, and remembering that you're still a human being with wants and needs too.  It can take a long time and a lot of guilt and judgement from others to find the right balance for yourself and your family's budget and needs.",

I find my quality of life pretty good really; I have lots of hobbies that I enjoy, feel glad to have the things I do even if they aren\u2019t the latest or fanciest of everything, and don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m missing out massively tbh. \n\nMe and my bf of 6 years are planning our first ever night in a hotel together in June, as we\u2019re going to a gig about an hour\u2019s drive away and want to have a few drinks but public transport isn\u2019t playing nice. And next year we\u2019re thinking about taking a few days abroad which would be our first time in 7 years and my first time abroad in 9 years! But I love the place I always take my kid in the UK (not saying where in case everyone descends and they get booked out before next year lol!).",

The people staying at the resort fell into one of four categories: (1) young couples, (2) young couples with very young children, (3) old couples, and (4) families with children that went to independent schools.  When we left two weeks later, the profile of guests changed entirely; all the guests checking in were now families with school aged children.  My mum told me that state schools had broken up for the holiday and the price to stay one week at the resort was now more than we had paid for two weeks.\n\nWhen I occasionally read an article about parents being fined for taking their kids out of school to go on holidays, I fully understand why.",

I was lucky. \n\nIf I was to get pregnant whilst at my current employer, I'd probably go back once I don't get paid. Not sure when that is as I don't intend on having another child.\n\nAnyway, this is relatively standard, what you have worked out.

Most parents are now eligible for 15 hours free childcare too, which I wasn't initially. I'll be getting 30 hours free from April, and that has brought my costs right down to around \u00a3400 plus, which fluctuates depending on whether it's term time or not. All of that really helps.\n\nOur monthly outgoings are probably about \u00a31700 for household bills including mortgage, and total income after tax is probably just under \u00a34k a month. \n\nWhen people want kids, they make it work. My sister runs her own cleaning business and works as many hours as she can, but it has to be supplemented with UC as she can't work a usual day as a single parent. When she was with their father, she didn't need that, but now he isn't much help during the week so needs must. People make it work.",

            "body": "Hi op, we're in our 30's with two kids aged 9 and 3. We don't have a family support network at all. And our eldest is special needs.\n\nWhen we had our eldest I took extended mat leave - we agreed that I would stay home for a few years.\n\nMy husband at the time earned 32k. We were not flush lol\n\nWe didn't have new clothes, I bought them off marketplace, I cooked every meal from scratch one week I managed to get our food budget down to \u00a328.00...I doubt it would come to that now.\n\nI remember that we booked a couple of Sun \u00a39.50 holidays in Wales and Great Yarmouth a few times a year, and packed a cardboard box of food to take with us. They're still some of the best holidays that stick in our minds. We hiked at the weekends, did nature walks, went round to friends houses and vise versa instead of going out. \n\nI saved Tesco points for days out or in a pinch petrol. I swapped supermarkets every month to benefit from their \"new customer\" offers as long as I could  and once , we both switched banks to get the \u00a3250.00 reward. In the end I said to my husband that I wanted to help us financially, he felt that he was failing in family (he absolutely 100% wasn't and I told him this repeatedly) but on the other hand he recognised that we  had gone as long as we could on just one wage.\n\nWhen our eldest was 2 I set up my own company so that I could work around school / nursery.\n\nIt took a few more years before we felt secure in being able to afford another kid which was 6 years later in total. It fucks us off when people comment on the \"huge\" age gap. \"No mate, we just have fuck all help from parents how the frig were we supposed to manage sooner with all of the meltdowns and some nights a TOTAL lack of sleep due to eldest needs\"? \n\nI genuinely cringe with horror at the thought of not being able to work for myself  it just takes some of the anxiety away with \"being late\" or distracted etc \n\nWith our second I went back to work after just six months, but with my self dictated hours it didn't feel too bad. \n\nMy husband and I both work from home most days, our eldestbis now in school, youngest in nursery. Once our youngest hits school age I feel it will be less demanding on us. \n\nSalary wise husband is on 40k now, I'm on 36k and our son recieves 6k a year in disability.\n\nBottom line is, don't be reckless with popping out kids, but how to afford it?.  You just.....make it work with what you have.",

But it solves the financial problem, and if that is the overwhelming issue for you then its a necessary evil - at least temporarily.\n\nAnother solution that allows some additional income without the expense of childcare is to buddy with another parent who has a similar aged child and lives nearby, trading off on childcare for a couple of days each week. If one parent takes both kids Monday and Tuesday, and the other takes them both Wednesday and Thursday, then both of them can have a 2 day per week part time job and not pay childcare.\n\nAnd finally...belt tightening. Some people prioritise having kids over any significant financial security, and operate on tight margins each month because they're prioritising whats important to them. They cut costs (many, though not all, of the costs associated with newborns are from people thinking they have to buy things new when they're available 2nd hand for much cheaper), they budget extremely carefully, etc.",

Properly saved as in gave up luxuries, not just putting aside any extra money each month. The advantage with saving for a good amount of time before is that it isn\u2019t such a drop in income when you start maternity leave - if you work now towards living as close as possible to just your salary, not only do you save the money your partner earns but you also can gradually get used to it so you make changes bit by bit rather than all at once when your income drops. And it gives you a great emergency fund.\nBabies don\u2019t need much, you can choose to spend thousands but you absolutely do not need to. \n\nChildcare is the real expense or if one parent stays at home, the impact that will have on their career. It looks like your partner is choosing to stay at home so that is decided. Could she work part time in the hours that you don\u2019t work? That is an approach many families take.\n\nSome things to consider would be when you will have paid off the car so no longer have that expense and what your current interest is on your mortgage and whether that is likely to go up or down.

It\u2019s better to regret NOT having kids than have kids and regret them because not only will you suffer, but so will your kids. Remember, kids are a lifetime commitment and you sign up for everything, whatever they turn out to be, when you decide to have a kid. A lot of parents unfortunately seem to forget that their child is a whole human being and not just their mini me to dress up and play with. Anyway, I\u2019m going off on a tangent here so what I\u2019m trying to say is that you most likely won\u2019t be able to afford a kid, not for a very very long time anyway, so if you DO choose to have a kid in this economy, not only are you purposely making your life a living hell by tying yourself down to a dead end job because you have a kid to feed, but you will also have the added stress of living under late stage capitalism whilst also trying to raise a child. Once you have a child you will be living paycheck to paycheck, barely scraping by, and then when your child grows up, they too will become another wage slave, and will most likely, live the same destitute lifestyle, working full time for barely any pay, and the cycle continues. It is just not worth it. I suggest browsing on r/regretfulparents and r/childfree because it will open your eyes massively to the terrible decision you\u2019re about to make. Remember, a child isn\u2019t a retirement plan, you can\u2019t guarantee your child will look after you when you\u2019re old and I hope you wouldn\u2019t expect them too, so think for a moment, take a deep breath, take a moment to really, really think about this HUGE change before you decide to go ahead with it. Because this country is in shambles right now and you can agree no matter what side you\u2019re on politically, we can all agree that this country has become a shell of itself, and that our government is currently imposing cuts on the poorest, most vulnerable members of society, which is essentially eugenics, now, your child has more chance of dying of cancer than curing it, and do you really want to add another person to our already overcrowded country and our overcrowded NHS hospitals? Do you really want to have a child only for them to potentially end up disabled one day and relying on benefits but then not being able to survive fully because their benefits have been cut? Because that is the reality for a huge, huge amount of our population in this country, and then the other half are the ones who are working and struggling in a dead end job that they hate, because our economy is absolutely fucked. Do you really want to bring a child into that society? why risk it? Every parent thinks it won\u2019t happen to them until it does, anyone has the potential to give birth to a sick or dying child, or a child with learning disabilities, or an incel, or a total loser, you sign up for it all when you decide to have a child the natural way. And that, on top of the state of our country and government right now, our future is looking very, very bleak, I think it is 100% cruel to try and justify bringing a child into this world, let alone this damn awful country of ours. There is absolutely no legitimate, selfless reason to have a child in our current society, especially in this country. please don\u2019t do it. You WILL regret it. It will ruin your life. at least if you regret not having a child, then you can adopt or something further down the line because only selfish people care about \u201cmUh bLoOdliNe\u201d and \u201cMuH leGacy\u201d, and there are plenty of kids who\u2019d need a loving home, so you won\u2019t need to regret not having kids because there\u2019s always adoption! Again, it\u2019s always better to regret not having kids than it is to have kids. DO. NOT. DO. IT. There is nothing ethical about having children in modern society, even if you think you can give them the best life, suffering is guaranteed even if there is some happiness, you can never fully predict how your child\u2019s life will turn out, even if they come from a happy stable background, you still just won\u2019t know for sure.

When we had our baby we joined an NCT group and it was interesting to see how divergent the experiences were.\n\nOne couple, like you, basically went into an inescapable spiral. Both parents didn't make enough money. But to advance their careers, they would need to invest in their careers, and this isn't easy with a child. If you're renting property, you're stuck in a death spiral where you can't generate enough income to escape and buy a house..\n\nQuite truthfully, the escape for a lot of those couples is significant familial support: grandparents who babysit and take pressure off of nursery fees, grandparents who allow the parents to work, family inheritance allowing a down payment, etc.\n\nThat's what I mean by inelastic. A good majority of couples make it work because of some luck or some aspect (like a single high earner). But if you're caught under the minimum threshold life gets very very hard.\n\nCareers really matter. There might not have been initially a great difference between, say, an elementary school teacher and an accountant...in the sense they might have have gone to the same schools and same upbringing.

Never do takeaways as like cooking. Have learnt how to shop well. Have a reliable but unsexy car, try to walk or cycle when possible. I work two days a week and have a small company on the side, my partner doesn't work and universal credit tops up our income but not much. If I need to spend money and don't have it I put it on a credit card, I don't worry about it. Kids are knackering, luckily I don't feel like I'm sacrificing anything except my energy. Id take a bullet for them, money doesn't come into the equation once you've had them.\u00a0",

Mine was statutory pay whereas my husband's was full pay for 6 months so I went back to work after 6 months and then he took over until over baby was 1 year old.\n\n2) Saved as much as possible before baby was born to cover the drop in my wages while on maternity leave.\n\n3) Did not go silly buying non-essentials for the baby or fancy version of anything if there was a safe and reliable cheaper alternative, like the \u00a360 IKEA cot vs silly money, pumped breastmilk vs formula, re-useable nappies vs disposable. Some things cannot be cheaped out on though\n\n4) Bought items using discounts and sales where possible. My work benefits package offers discounts to loads of shops so explore that option if possible. But places that offer cashback can also help.\n\n5) Once baby was 1 year old she went to a childminder which are waaaaay cheaper than day nurseries and much better care IMO. She was a term-time only childminder so we covered the school holidays between our holiday allowance, visiting grandparents for a week or arranging childcare for any shortfall.\n\n6) Utilise Tax-Free Childcare to get the 20% off childcare fees, and now there are free hours from 9 months old which we didn't get before\n\n7) Have a lodger for a bit of extra income\n\n8) We have no debts other than mortgage, so no car payments or others to worry about. We made do with our small car and bought items to fit, like a compact pram, etc.\n\nThe most expensive time for us was when both kids were with the childminder with no free hours and only the Tax-Free Childcare discount. At the peak it was \u00a32000 per month on childcare (after the discount) but that was only for 6 months and we saved to cover that temporary increase in expenses. Once our oldest was 3 years old she went to a local preschool which took the 30 hours funding and it cost us \u00a35 a week as a voluntary donation. She's now at school and we pay after school club for \u00a3300 per month. Our youngest has recently turned 3 years old so she will be going to preschool and using the free ours and dropping her expenses right down too (\u00a3240 per term now).\n\nIt's expensive but doable and worth it. They're funny little creatures.",

I get that mortgage rates have rocketed (my previously 900/month mortgage is now 1600) but a no kids couple spending 2.4k on bills seems like a lot. \n\nIf you have mortgaged yourself right up, and taken a car loan on top, then yes, kids or not, going down to one salary is going to be a problem, given you've borrowed against both. \n\nAre there some costs to cut there? Clearly it's hard to offer anything specific without knowing what's inside that, but going down to one 3k payslip is a non starter with 2.4k of bills. \n\nGenerally, people go back to work. At 9 months there is 15 free hours of childcare (due to become 30 in September). Yes, there is a bit of a bite in the last few months of mat leave if the employer has a poor maternity leave offer, but that is only temporary so can be saved for.\n\nThe 30 hour offer means your wife could work 3 days and the nursery bill won't help too bad (there will still be one, because the free hours are only 38 weeks per year, so you have to pay for the other 13) - perhaps \u00a3270/month (based on \u00a380/day), whilst your wife might be bring home close to \u00a32000/month, giving you some spending money.",

We always had two reliable second hand cars. We had two weeks in Greece every summer, and another week long holiday abroad in the autumn when I was a teenager. We went out for birthday dinners and Christmas was always a big affair. We never had flash stuff, but I did quite a few clubs (football, swimming, etc.). We never had Sky or anything, but we had a games console and that.\n\nSo this idea that average parents of yesteryear were always down to their last penny is bullshit. A working couple with (below) median salaries could have a comfortable life only one generation ago.\n\nIt is not unreasonable to think that a full-time working couple should be able to own a home and have kids, and still be able to have a holiday and get Netflix.",

And it's all gone to plan, I'm earning twice what my dad did. They're genuinely very proud of what I've done and are glad that their parenting paid off (as am I). And I'm very comfortable; I'm really not trying to come across as \"woe is me\".\n\nBut it doesn't really seem to have gotten me anywhere... My house is comparable to theirs. I'm also driving an alright second hand car. I go on similar holidays (a couple of weeks in Europe a year where I try to watch the budget). I can't see myself retiring before 60 though, and I'm not even planning to have kids like they did.\n\nJust feels sometimes like you do everything you can to make something of yourself, and in the end you just about 'keep up' with what was the norm 20 years ago.",
