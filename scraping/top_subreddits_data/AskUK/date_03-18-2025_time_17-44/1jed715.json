Is this normally what happens? I have been given the time off from my employer, and they are paying me, but will this be a problem for my employer when they claim the expense back, seen as I haven't been required?",

They made it clear that that was not grounds for excusal. Missed a whole bunch of mandatory lectures, tutorials and labs, plus all the associated bumff that comes with 1st classes in new subjects. When I became ill later in the semester I had to turn up to sign in then go to sleep at the back of a lab for four hours or I would get an automatic fail after missing the first one.\n\n\nSecond time was a different area and I managed to get out of it because I was moving away on the Saturday and the date was the Monday two days later. Fortunately they seemed to think *that* was a reasonable excuse.\n\n\nThird time was the original area but I was staying with my brother several hundred miles away and would not be returning for another few months. The lady on the phone seemed to think that was also a reasonable excuse, thank goodness. I imagine she didn't fancy me submitting a travel expense claim for a train ticket from south England to central Scotland.\n\n\nI am hoping and praying I won't be called a fourth time because frankly the first case was bullshit and I know better than to trust a jury after that experience. I still cannot believe the prosecution submitted blood evidence with no actual evidentiary value. They didn't even prove whose it was, never mind how long it had been there. Gil Grissom would have been furious.",
