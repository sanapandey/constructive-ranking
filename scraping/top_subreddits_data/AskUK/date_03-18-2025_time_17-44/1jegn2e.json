We also see a lot of aggression, and a severe lack of ownership over one's actions. \n\nDaily, when the boys I teach get caught being violent or verbally aggressive, they will never ever own up to it. They will never apologise. They are vehemently outraged that they face a sanction. \n\nIt's frightening.",

However, the teachers didn\u2019t seem to understand the issue or take the time to properly address it. Instead, the assembly focused on celebrating women and their achievements, which completely missed the mark. To make matters worse, some of the things the teacher said apparently ended up reinforcing the very misogyny they were trying to challenge.",
