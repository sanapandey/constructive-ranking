A pack of standard painkillers is like 40p but I\u2019m sure if seen Nurofen near a fiver.\n\nPlaudits to their marketing team, seems insane though.\n\n",

That was the really old one though, must be 15 years or so since it went off the market.\n\n\nSo if you want it, you just pop to the chemists, buy co-codamol and some Kwells (same thing as the old Feminax and magical). Take two co-codamol, \u2154 of a Kwells (admittedly awkward, I'm sure a full one is fine), sink a double espresso and you're golden. Bonus points if you can get a powernap in there somewhere. \n\n\nWhich all feels awfully like they just wanted to make things more awkward. I can't remember when they got the rights to sell naproxen OTC under their brand, but maybe that influenced the decision too.",

However, the unfortunate truth was that it was a terrible formulation - vastly over-complicated and problematic in the end product - and the competitor products were far better in almost all cases (I was responsible for testing them to try and produce evidence for the claims).\n\nBy 'better', I mean that ours often didn't disintegrate properly, whereas the competitor ones did. And ours would sometimes rupture or fall apart during processing due to the poor formulation.\n\nFor some/many years, the NHS continued to buy our branded stuff at the high prices.\n\nBut in the end, branding has a bigger overhead it has to cover, so it charges premium prices most of the time.",

For non-westerners, local traditional medicines will also exhibit placebo effects\n- it also works in reverse, if someone tells you that a completely neutral intervention will hurt you or make you feel worse, you will feel it\n\nHowever, it is important to note that placebo is all about perception. No placebo will *solve* an issue like cancer or MND or arthritis, but it absolutely can help manage symptoms like pain on an acute basis.\n\nI think it's also related to the phenomenon that gymrats sometimes experience where they don't realise that their bar has extra weight on it and accidentally bench for reps 10lbs over their previous 1-rep max because they thought it was 20lbs under \u2013 the connection between the mind and the body is not omnipotent, but it is interesting, and it is quite potent in some areas.",

The ibuprofen lysine is a salt, largely this just means that it dissolves really well and whilst still chiral (has two ways of having a physical shape) because it's absorbed faster it's less noticeable if there's a mix. \n\nOn the other hand paracetamol doesn't have this physical property so all paracetamol is pretty much equivalent so any difference between producers is going to be about how well it dissolves.",

For specific nasties like nitrosamines, we have to ensure that there is no more than 0.000001 gram per dose (value depends on the nitrosamine itself as some more potent so may need to be controlled to a lower level). \n\nThe health authorities do NOT fuck around at all when it comes to quality.

Regardless of how well I'm able to eat food, for some reason medication causes issues with me and has for my entire life.\n\nFor some people, trying to take medication - even with water - can trigger [globus](https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/ears-nose-and-throat/feeling-of-something-in-your-throat-globus/). No matter how much you drink and try to wash it down, there's a constant sensation of something stuck in your throat for *hours*. Why this happens? Doctors aren't sure. They *think* the root cause is psychological, but it's not a very well understood thing. For some people, trying to bypass the chewing instinct and swallowing the item whole can cause it. For others, they have no idea.\n\n[Dysphagia](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/swallowing-problems-dysphagia/) can happen for a lot of reasons. Some psychological. Some caused by other conditions like GERD, ADHD or Autism, cancer, or some medications.\n\nMost pills are a pretty different texture than a mouthful of food that you've spent time chewing and tasting. Many medications also have a disagreeable taste, designed to stop children from eating them like lollies, but this can also have a psychological impact on adults as well.",

The ibuprofen lysine is a salt, largely this just means that it dissolves really well and whilst still chiral (has two ways of having a physical shape) because it's absorbed faster it's less noticeable if there's a mix. \n\nOn the other hand paracetamol doesn't have this physical property so all paracetamol is pretty much equivalent so any difference between producers is going to be about how well it dissolves. Same for naproxen and aspirin, though with aspirin some folks prefer to buy ones with gastro resistant coatings to minimise stomach irritation and different manufacturers will work better for different people. \n\nDisclaimer: I'm not a pharmacist but I did study organic chemistry at uni. If you have any particular health concerns around GI issues please ask a pharmacist which they'd recommend with your specific physiology, they do know a lot about these things (infinitely more than most doctors).",

It's really just to skip some of the the 30 mins to 1 hr time it normally takes to dissolve. The actual benefit is questionable. \n\nCheaper brands contain the same drug, usually the same amount but they use very basic pill binding agents like cellulose, starch etc. It could potentially take longer to dissolve and hit the blood. Again, it's debatable if it does. \n\nAlso some contain caffeine, which acts as a booster for some drugs like paracetamol. \n\nSo more expensive painkillers can be slightly more effective, but they largely do the same thing. You definitely can't target the pill to a specific area of the body.",

You can buy a syrup for just a every differ coughing, and yet when you read the back of the box, the same ingredient at the same concentration.  As an aside it is *much* cheaper to buy bog standard paracetamol and generic phenylephrine than it is to buy Lemsip (or even a supermarket generic)\n\nI find it odd that some pharmacies are twitchy about providing generics, or the pharmacy assistants aren\u2019t familiar with the generic or ingredient names of the branded products.  Asking for co-dydramol resulted in a lot of blank stares, until I asked for Paramol.\n\nThere are some drugs which recipients can be extremely sensitive to, even though they all need bioequivalence certification, e.g. antiepileptics so some people will prefer to stay with a well known brand.  I\u2019ve had awful adverse reactions to off-brand salbutamol, so I asked my Dr if I could just stick with Ventolin, and they agreed; but Ventolin vs off-brand salbutamol isn\u2019t going to break the NHS budget.",

Many people will tell you there's no difference from standard ibuprofen but there definitely is, and people who suffer from chronic pain tend to work out these differences. Even pharmacists will tell you that some brands of generic drugs just don't work for some people and they don't know why. I had it happen once and thought I was crazy until I went back to the pharmacy and they told me I wasn't the first person and that some people get on with some brands more than others so it's worth changing the brand and seeing the difference. My mum had a similar thing with side effects on HRT, switched back to the other brand and the side effects went away. Anyway  I found out what brand I had before and have never had any problems since then. The point is sometimes the brand will make a difference for some people and 'generic' doesn't mean exactly the same chemically.",
