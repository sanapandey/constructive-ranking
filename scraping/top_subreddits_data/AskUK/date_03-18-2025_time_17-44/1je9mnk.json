Luckily my specialism turned out to be pretty recession proof and I walked into a contract job a couple of rungs up the ladder.\n\nI was trying to break into IT during the dotcom bust in 2001, however, and that was hard. I had funded my own study with personal loans- some Microsoft qualifications - but couldn\u2019t get a job in IT to make my investment worthwhile. I fell back on being a temporary secretary (which was what I was trying to escape from) until one of the tech guys in the firm I was working at told me about a Helpdesk role that might become available in a few months. I bided my time and kept my eyes open for the role, and when it was advertised I applied for it and got it.\n\nThe thing is, these things are cyclical. Trust me, things are not bad yet. Hopefully they won\u2019t get too bad, but if they do, things will be tough, but we\u2019ll also get through it and then things will improve again. They always do.",
