I work permanent lates, I'm often out, after dark, on my own and I take all the usual precautions, when walking home. No earbuds in, wearing good walking shoes, practical clothing, trying to keep to a well lit route etc. \n\nNot long after the Sarah Everard murder, I was tailed down the street by a police car.  I'm almost certain they thought I was up to no good,( I, probably, look like a young lad from behind in dim light, with my beanie on and dressed like a docker) because they took off when I got level with a well lit takeaway. \n\nNormally, this wouldn't bother me at all but, after what happened to Sarah, it freaked me out a bit.",
