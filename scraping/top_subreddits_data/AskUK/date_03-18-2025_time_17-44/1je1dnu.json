    "selftext": "I was reflecting on the times I've visited Southern Europe. There always seem to be fruit trees everywhere. Oranges, lemons, pomegranates etc.\n\nThe UK has dozens, if not hundreds of traditional varieties of apples, pears, plums etc. Yet, most gardens (that aren't just paved over) have ornamental trees and bushes. I don't understand why we would turn our noses up at trees with beautiful blossoms that produce free food.\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

I also planted blueberries and strawberries. Last year I got 4 blueberries and 1 strawberry, we didn't get enough sun and the slugs were brutal. But I'm glad that I've planted as much as I have, even if I don't get to enjoy the fruits of my own labour.\n\nEdited to clarify my last sentence and to add:\n\nI didn't expect so many lovely comments from enthusiastic gardeners. I hope we all have a great season this year and actually get to enjoy a few of our strawberries!",

Apple tree, unexpected pond (garden was a shit hole) thankfully with a grid in it so i didn't fall in. Gunnerra and a big clumping bamboo section behind the pond along the back. Have grass but also stuck in 3 raised beds and mixed clover and grass seed. Did try red clover but it flowers then nothing really. Added nutrients tho as I accidentally put in a cover crop so that's going to be where I stick a frame up for climbers. \n\nBunch of smaller trees out the front FIL (loves gardening and ours was bigger and entirely unkept when we got here) put in 11 years ago are now 15ft high. Do need something along the back for wind cover but also it's our view of the fields so bit of a puzzler there.\n\nNot planning on moving tho so trees are more of an option for us. SO has a weeping willow that's about 6ft now. Looking at willow to fill in some gaps and maybe make a hedge on one side and some living arches or similar.",

They get very big when grown from seed though so it'll want to be in the ground eventually to be happy.\n\nYou might know all this already but just in case, most apple trees aren't self fertile, meaning most will need another tree nearby for pollination to produce fruit. The trees need to be different varieties in the same or adjacent flowering group (meaning they flower at a similar time of year.) Since you're growing from seed you won't know what flower group your tree is part of until it first blooms. You might be lucky and have a self fertile tree, or another suitable tree nearby.",

Was intensely fruity and went beautifully on greek yoghurt (not the port one!). Bought a cherry stoner as cutting up that many damsons to get the stones out was an absolute ball ache.\n\n  \nWe've turned a bit of the garden into a mini orchard, we have apple, plum, greengage, cherry and pear with raspberry and blueberry canes around the outside. There's 3 crabapples on the verge too. All too young to get fruit from but hopefully in a few years...",

We've had both apple trees and pear trees, and for starters, a fully mature fruit tree produces far more fruit than even a family is capable of consuming. Like, it's really a lot. Even when you consider that probably over half of them are bad via just dying, or being infested with insects, or fungus, or being picked off by squirrels and birds. So it's actually quite a lot of work to vet each fruit you pick, because you don't want to take a bite and find out your teeth went through a caterpillars holiday home. It's gross.\n\nThen there is clean up. Because you can't harvest or even use all the fruit it bears, the fruit just falls off the tree and rots. Which means you have to clean them up pretty much every day while it's in season and dispose of them properly. If you don't, it turns into a fermented, stinky slurry on the ground that turns your garden into essentially a slip and fall solicitors wet dream, and this sticks around well into winter time before it rots away fully. \n\nWe got far better results from our blackberry bush. Small berries that are delicious, don't cause too much of a mess, can be taken and used for pies or jams. Great stuff.

My garden has multiple plum trees, and my mum has pretty much an actual apple orchard.\n\nThing is though, small scale fruit trees aren't as great as you think. Unless you spray, you're going to lose an *awful* lot of your fruit to pests. (Admittedly, plums are *especially* bad for this).\n\nAnd it's a fair bit of work looking after the trees, picking, and cleaning up after them (kilos and kilos of plums all over the road behind our house, which pisses off the neighbours) - definitely more work than it's worth if you're not *really* into that particular fruit. (I don't even like plums sadly - they came with the house).\n\nI do miss the lemon and mandarin trees we had when I was a kid though (in Australia). I'd have those again in a heartbeat, if the climate allowed.",
