    "selftext": "Evening all! \n\nI am after some help trying to identify what is burrowing up against the perimeter of my house. The hole reappears after a few days in the exact same spot when I refill it with the stones.\n\nThe past few evenings I have noticed what sounds like sniffing/breathing noise coming from what appears to be my front door (opposite side of the house where the hole is). On closer inspection there is nothing visible so I am led to believe that the noise is coming from under the floor slab? \n\nOne strange thing I noticed the other evening when I could hear the noise was a cat at my front door staring at the floor like it could sense something below the ground. \n\nThank you all in advance for your help!
