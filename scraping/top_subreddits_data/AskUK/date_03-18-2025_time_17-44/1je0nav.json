Then suddenly someone started posting old videos on YouTube and finally proved I hadn't gone insane. \n\nSimilar story with Bamzooki.

Really good piece of 3D kit that I'm sure ignited a passion for engineering / 3D animation in a lot of kids.\n\nI always made long worms with as many legs as I could fit on the poor creatures.

I think it was probably a dream at this point, but obviously can never confirm that.\n\nThis was in the early or mid 90s and I was sick off school (just a cold that I was probably dramatizing for a day off).  At that point, I think we had basic cable provided by NTL - basically, cartoon network.  \n\nThe show looked like Widget the world watcher, which is the closest I've come to when trying to find what it was.  There's also a ridiculous amount of animated shows from the 80s and 90s, but I think I've seen most of them.  \n\nWhat makes this stick in my mind is that the main character was a worn on an environmental mission.  Basically widget the fucking world watcher, right?  Expect that this was some next level doomer shit.  I remember the worm taking children into the sky to watch the death of the planet.  The worm's attitude was disconcertingly calm and accepting, and the whole production had an odd religious feel to it.  I only saw a few moments, it blew my mind and I turned it off.  \n\nAgain, best hypothesis is that it was a dream or fake memory.  The uncanny nature of it supports this, but if you've ever had an experience of mysterious childhood experiences, you'll know what I mean when I say I can't help but think it was something real.",

She died around 1991 so it was definitely on in the 80s.\n\n\nThe theme tune was something like \"came to earth as dining chaiiiiirs\" and then a little boy sang \"Henry, I'm helping Henry and I'm telling Henry everything I know\".\n\n\nGoogle hasn't helped me find it and if I ask about it people just think I'm confused with another show or something.

Absolutely loved it to the point where my friends and I would write alternative scripts. Moved to the UK years ago and still yet to meet a British person who has ever heard of this show.",
