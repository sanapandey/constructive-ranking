    "selftext": "My parents had loads of debt growing up and we had nothing to show for it. Nothing remotely expensive in the house, no holidays, just a lot of deprivation. My mum smoked heavily too, i realise now that she prioritised that over literally anything else.\n\nMy ex husband was terrible with money, this was hidden in the beginning of our relationship as we were both unemployed (curtesy of the 2008 crash, just turned 19 and 20) and then had a series of part time nmw jobs. Then we both got better paid jobs, his was much more, and moved into a slightly more expensive rental, better for our two kids with a garden etc, still significantly cheaper than todays rent at \u00a3695pm!. We had easily \u00a350k income between us. \n\nMy ex racked up loads of debt, we were struggling to make ends meet, I was struggling to get enough food for us and my ex told me that we couldn't afford for me to take driving lesson (even though he insisted when we were brasic a few years previously!). When I brought up that I don't understand why we were struggling so much with the amount of money we'rebringing in, he gaslit me and told me that i don't understand money. I now realise this was financial abuse.\n\nI'm 5 years out, I'm a single parent and my income is significantly less than I was with my ex and yet I'm able to afford a lot more than I was with him. I'm also able to afford a lot more than my parents were able to (both were working in well paid jobs). My ex and my parents keep asking how I'm able to afford \"expensive\" things: I don't waste my money and I save up for what I need. My debt is strategic and only for necessary items eg kids shoes. So at any point in time I'm only in debt by a few hundred pounds, mainly through Klarna. And I can show exactly what I've gone into debt for. They could never.\n\nI'm dumbfounded about what they spent their money on?!! They can't tell me, always blaming the other parent (now divorced) and all three at some point blamed me, though I've no idea how I did that.",

One time we spent the whole weekend indoors watching shit telly and I realised that the two bottles of Courvoiser he'd drank (mixed with cola... fucking barbarian) cost more than a week of my mum's shopping I never went back.\n\nI got really into dinosaurs when I was eight and my mum sat with me on the coach for four hours each way to go to the Natural History Museum to see the dinosaurs. I would genuinely say it was one of the most important days of my life - we ate a packed lunch and did not go to the gift shop. I am now a project manager at the Natural History Museum and I get to see the dinosaurs every day. I still bring a packed lunch; except when my mum visits - then we eat at the cafeteria and go to the gift shop.\n\nI'm not saying raising kids in poverty is easy, or that people should have to do it, or that all parents who aren't providing for their kids are doing so by choice. But there are absolutely some 'parents' who are choosing to neglect their kids through prioritising their own amusements; just as there are many crying themselves to sleep on an empty stomach because they can't provide what their kids need no matter how much they sacrifice.",

            "body": "When my mum realised no one was watching what was in my lunchbox anymore, it went from being a sandwich, bag of crisps, a piece of fruit, cake bar and a drink to just a sandwich and a drink. The drink was this tiny pathetic bottle (we didn't have any water fountains to way to get water unless you brought your own). I went from getting about 500-600 cal, maybe more for lunch to less than 200. The sandwich was just two pieces of bread and a single slice of wafer thin meat. I also didn't get breakfast. The old snacks I used to have just vanished. Mum just stopped buying them. I wasn't allowed to make myself any food when I got home, mum only bought just enough for what she needed for the week. If I ate something I wasn't supposed to, there was screaming, hitting. Dinner was served on this tiny, kids sized plate (she had a normal plate) and she didn't even fill mine. For example, I'd get four chicken nuggets, about four mouthfuls of pease and maybe three new potatoes. That was it. I might get a piece of fruit or a bag of crisps as a snack, but I didn't get much else. I was walking to school and back, doing PE and martial arts in the evenings (classes were super cheap). I was my adult height of 5'11 at 14, underweight and struggling badly sometimes with my muscles just collapsing from under me, which has never happened as an adult no matter how hard I train. \n\nThis wasn't done for money reasons. Mum had a job at this point. She just didn't want to spend money on me. I was lucky to go to my martial arts classes, I know that (she was making me ride horses that was more expensive before she finally let me quit to do what I wanted to do), but removing your kids food like that? Screaming and hitting if they got so hungry they couldn't help eating something of hers (she always had snacks for herself). That wasn't fair. I asked for more food, I asked for bigger main meals, denied, more healthy snacks, denied, more snacks, denied. All with screaming and hitting if I pushed it too far. \n\nWe were poor before this as mum didn't have a job, sometimes I was hungry and there wasn't anything we could do. I never blamed mum for that. She was doing her degree etc as a mature student (in her 40s). My mum was abusive though, very abusive. It sucked and I'm not sure why she decided controlling my food to that degree was a good idea. It was so bad I could barely finish a happy meal, that's how bad it was. I know, one parent family, we were still poor even with mum working full time, but food, I should have been allowed to eat.",

But she was too strict with treats. I mean, I grew up thinking coke was meant to be diluted (I actually prefer it this way, don\u2019t come for me!).\n\nThis meant that when I got to secondary, I was spending all my dinner money on sweets and crisps. But mostly sweets. Most mornings I would visit the local corner shop and buy as much as my funds would allow. I\u2019d secretly snack on them during class. A lot of my spare change also was spent on sweets which I kept hidden in my room. This wasn\u2019t healthy at all and encouraged me to binge. \n\nSo everything in moderation I say. With my own daughter, I don\u2019t deny food or label anything as bad. We always have a stocked cupboard filled with treats and she knows that there is no need to sneak around. When she was really little, I\u2019d serve her pudding with her meal. If she ate it first, that\u2019s fine. Usually she was still hungry and ate her dinner so dinner refusal wasn\u2019t something we struggled with. Most importantly though, I did this to ensure dessert wasn\u2019t viewed as a reward. It\u2019s just food.",

They only didn't have our house repossessed because my grandad bailed them out. Years and years later, when they split and the house was sold - the entire amount the house was bought for was still owed as dad had kept it on Interest Only payments. Mum was also shafted as they weren't married, so although she didn't work to support his work and study, she got half the house and that was it. \n\nTL;DR: I don't feel it from my perspective, but now as a mum and looking back, I'm really angry at my dad for prioritising his personal spends and keeping up with the Jones' attitude, and letting my mum foot the worry about housing and clothing his children.

I always had what I needed - a roof over my head, sufficient nutritious food, toys to play with, books to read and clothes that weren't worn out (although they were hand-me-downs from my cousins). And I did get a LOT of love and attention from my parents.\u00a0\n\n\nBut I certainly didn't get any frivolous stuff. We went on 1 family holiday ever, when I was 5, to a seaside town about an hour's drive away. Never again. Certainly never went abroad. We went on day trips sometimes, but only to free places (the beach or the park? Yes. Soft play, theme parks, theatre etc? No, never). We also never went out to eat at restaurants.\n\n\nMy parents both smoked though, and my dad drank every single day - not a lot, but 1 or 2 beers every night adds up.\u00a0In fact, my dad always seemed to have money for some new hobby or fixation; one moment he'd fill the conservatory with exotic plants (which would eventually all die when he lost interest), the next thing you knew he'd be buying an expensive new telescope and books on astronomy, or new musical instruments that he wanted to learn how to play. My mum, on the other hand, absolutely never spent money on herself, ever (except her cigarettes). They also fought about money, loudly, A LOT.\u00a0\n\n\nDidn't really put two and two together til I grew up and moved out and my mum started talking to me more like a friend than a daughter, but turns out my dad was very selfish and impulsive with his spending, and blew all his money straight away, so my mum had to spend her entire min-wage salary\u00a0on bills, food and basic necessities (and her 3 cigarettes a day). There wasn't enough for anything else. Plus both my dad and my mum were bad with money generally (bad at maths, didn't know how to budget etc). My mum also had a lot of credit card debt that she'd racked up when I was very young because she didn't really understand how credit card interest worked, and it added up V quickly.\u00a0\n\nThey're still shit with money to this day. A while back my dad got into a car accident that wasn't his fault, and got over \u00a3100,000 in compensation. Rather than investing it, or even putting it into a high interest savings account and budgeting it, he blew through it all on fun stuff in a few short years (mum didn't get a penny of it) and now they're back to living on the breadline. It's just sad.\n\n\nThey own their (small ex-council) house, but have zero savings. So when they get too old to live independently they're going to have to sell the house to pay for care, but the money won't last long so it'll be up to me to pay the rest - one last blow for me.\u00a0",

So a large percentage of our money went into that. We had a yearly holiday on the coast and the odd day trip - but apart from that we never really did anything. Never had takeaways, no sky tv, neither of them had hobbies or anything like that. Pretty much every evening was at home watching tv. \n\nMy dad/step mum on the other hand were all about having fun. They didn't give a crap about the house or appearances - and it showed! I remember both the kitchen and bathroom being in bits for years as my dad wanted to do everything himself to save money, but never got round to it. But, every weekend we were there we'd spend out in the pub with them or at a house party. Pretty much every weekend we had a chinese or indian.",

            "body": "The problem with questions and topics like this op is that a lot of people have fundamentally no understanding of what being poor or being in poverty means. The same is true for what people perceive as wealth. \n\nJust look at multiple forums online and listen to people in your own life and you'll see that people are very deluded and detached from reality in this topic and that ultimately what's poor and rich can be much more subjective than you think. People earning minimum wage can see a 60k or even a 100k salary as high wealth when it isn't really these days. \n\nI've a colleague in his early 30s who earns a grand a week and owns a property with his fiance and child near London, and he maintains he \"doesn't have a pot to piss in.\"  That's far from poverty, yet the way he talks to people, you'd swear they are living on the breadline.\n\nSo ultimately, you'll have people here saying they grew up piss poor, but if questioned, or they revealed their income and so on, you'd see they very much were not.  Growing up in a council estate does not mean one is poor. I've known plenty of comfortable people living in estates. This means nothing these days.",
