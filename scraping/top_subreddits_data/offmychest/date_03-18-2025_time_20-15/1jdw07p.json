As we were leaving the restaurant, we strolled across the street on the side of a high story building with sort of a cul de sac where a man was cycling around with packages behind his bike. Suddenly I heard him yell, \"OH SHIT\" and I looked left and up and saw a man fall down to the concrete. I started to back up off the sidewalk and into the road. My partner tried to hold and shelter me from it, telling me not to look.\n\nNext thing I saw was the blood on the concrete below his head. Him just laying there. People calling 911. Doorman yelling for a tablecloth from the restaurant/bar across the street. Someone laid a cloth over his head. Then a tarp. We tried to stop adults with their kids from passing by. It was awful. I'm still in shock.",

We ended up covered in her blood she landed so close! Thankfully my son was asleep and didn\u2019t see anything. \n\nThe shock lasted a few weeks. Thankfully I had no PTSD symptoms. \n\nI found that going to the inquest to find out why she jumped was really healing. Since then I\u2019ve barely thought about it. \n\nTake it easy and make sure you talk about it with people.",

He and another man who had come from the opposite direction tried to stop families from coming past as it was school pick-up time and there was a school nearby, but barely anybody listened to him. Quite a few apparently said to him \"it's fine, they won't be bothered\" about their primary school aged kids. Sadly I imagine it's stuck in the minds of a lot of those children.

I have had things that would without care have caused PTSD in the last year such as seeing someone trip and burn to death on the sidewalk. I did what I could for them and I appreciate not having that replaying in my head constantly anymore. This is horrible. Suicide is also something that witnessing it does increase the odds of someone going there themselves. I am sorry you went through this",
