They will say if they don't like something and they say when they do like something. \n\nI feel like the guys who say \"women are so complicated\" are the same ones too busy staring at our ass and tits to actually process words that come out of our mouths. \n\nThen when they're with their gf for a while they get accustomed to their beauty and take it for granted. Then they start to have more of an attention span for the words we have been communicating..... but now it's considered nagging bc they haven't been listening to a damn word we've said, just saying and doing whatever they feel they have to do for a chance at sex with the woman they're desperately trying to entertain.\n\nThis is why I first stopped dating tbf. I just kind of came to this conclusion that guys only talk to you to have sex with you. They may like you after and date you, but the first few months when I'm being my genuine self, they're being fake af trying to get in my bed. There's no point in being genuine to someone disingenuous. Theres no point sacrificing time and energy for that either. Fuck em lol",

If I start trying to have a conversation the second we get home from work, he won't hear a word I'm saying but, that's cause his brain is still in work mode and he's not adjusted to being back home yet, so, we tend to have \"decompress time\" when we get home, where we just leave each other alone for the first hour once we're home from work, just so we can relax and unwind first, if I try and strike up a conversation with him after that, he's fully switched on and getting involved in the conversation.\n\nI find that it's only really hard to talk to guys when there's something on their mind. I grew up with two older brothers I was pretty close to and it was the same kinda thing, I could always tell something was wrong because they would go from listening to that weird, looking THROUGH me rather than at me when I was talking to them and I could tell they just weren't paying attention.\n\nI've been with my partner for a good few years now and I've found that, he's became a lot better at talking with me about stuff but, I've learned not to pry if he doesn't want to talk about something, like, if I can tell he's stressed but won't talk, just leave it alone, the more I pester him about it, the longer it'll take for him to come around from whatever getting him down!",

Obviously some say whats on their mind but certainly not everbody. There are female struggels and there are male struggels and one must learn what the other has on their mind. \n\nAnd of course there are men who just wanna fuck they also are those who talk more frequently with women. But you cant tell me that there arent also many women that also just have the same goal. I know women that i consider friends but I dont wanna be the forth wheel in this \"love\" triagle",
