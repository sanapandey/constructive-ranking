And don\u2019t let it be for a measly 5 minutes, you\u2019re not even letting the person get aroused and comfortable. ",

You don't need to press hard (unless your partner likes that), even a soft caress on the clit and lips can get your partner going. \n\nThe most important thing is to talk to your partner. Ask them if they liked what you did/are doing, do they want it faster or slower, softer or rougher. That can all change depending on the moment, so communicate during the act.",

Some like it soft and slow at first, others a bit rougher. Ask her to tell you what feels best.\n\n\nUse the right lube - a good water based one is ideal.\n\n\nMake sure she's comfortable and relaxed. Make the bed all nice and neat or let her lounge at her favorite spot on the couch.
