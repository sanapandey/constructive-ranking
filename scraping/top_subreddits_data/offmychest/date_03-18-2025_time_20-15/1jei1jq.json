I pretended to have my normal evening phone call with him while stressing out the door, I complained on the phone about my early morning doctors appointment tomorrow\u2026 EEEEEK!!! I feel like a double agent.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the big birthdays too. He\u2019s been sounding a bit sad about feeling lonely about the birthday and ive damn near exploded from desire to say something but I\u2019ve managed to keep my mouth shut  can\u2019t believe it\u2019s happening so soon!! \n\nI\u2019ve coordinated with his neighbor to let me in through the big door and his roommate to tape the key to the apartment under the mailboxes so I can sneak in tomorrow morning and sing happy birthday.\n\nCan\u2019t wait to see him and I can\u2019t wait to see the look on his face!",

From someone who has been through too many storms, there's no time for that.\n\nYou will have the best time and he will ALWAYS remember it. He won't be lonely and that's what life is about. Sharing it with the people who want to share it with you but not feel the need to do it.\n\nYou want to be there with him, it doesn't get any better than that.",
