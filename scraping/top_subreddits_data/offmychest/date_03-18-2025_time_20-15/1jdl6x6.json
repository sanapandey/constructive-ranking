But after a few years of marriage, I started feeling like something was missing. I thought maybe a child would give my life more meaning, that it would bring some kind of fulfillment I couldn\u2019t get anywhere else. Everyone always says having kids changes your life in a beautiful way. So I convinced myself it was the right thing to do.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nMy son is 11 now, and I can\u2019t stand him. I don\u2019t just mean he gets on my nerves\u2014I mean I almost hate him. He was diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder, but honestly, that\u2019s just a fancy way of saying he enjoys making people suffer. He doesn\u2019t listen, he doesn\u2019t care, and he actively goes out of his way to make life harder for everyone around him.\n\nHis favorite thing to do is ruin things on purpose. A couple of weeks ago, I spent hours assembling a shelf. The second I was done, he walked over and kicked it until it collapsed\u2014then laughed. Today, I came home from work to find he had smeared food all over the walls just to piss me off. When I told him to clean it up, he locked himself in my office and dropped my laptop into a bucket of mop water. Years of work, destroyed. For fun.\n\nI just walked out of the house after that. I didn\u2019t yell. I didn\u2019t cry. I just got in my car and left. I\u2019m in some random parking lot now, staring at my dashboard, and all I can think is, I don\u2019t want to do this anymore.\n\nEveryone tells you parenting is tough but rewarding. That even when it\u2019s hard, you\u2019ll still feel that deep love and connection. But what if you don\u2019t? What if the only thing you feel is regret? No one talks about that. No one prepares you for the possibility that you might look at your own child and feel nothing but exhaustion and resentment.\n\nIf I could go back, I wouldn\u2019t have done this. I would\u2019ve told my past self that a child won\u2019t magically give your life purpose. That if you already feel lost, a kid will only make it worse. I thought I was missing something before, but now I know\u2014I was fine. I should have just left things the way they were.\n\nBut now, I\u2019m stuck. And I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to get through the next few years without completely losing myself.\n\nI don\u2019t want advice. I don\u2019t want help. I just needed to say this somewhere",

The icing on the cake is that they never pay attention to the teachers and make fun of them, but of course, my nephew is the one who causes the students to get distracted.\n\nI believe in your wife, and I don\u2019t blame her if she ever loses her temper when confronting one of those ignorant parents. What surprises me most is that these parents always try to blame the teacher for their children\u2019s inability to develop their skills and creativity in class, when the blame lies entirely with the parents. They always want teachers to care for and educate their children; values \u200b\u200bcome from home.",

Most of my cousins \u200b\u200b(who are now over 40) have children, and they\u2019re rebellious and hyperactive.\n\nSo I completely understand the stubbornness of ignorant adults who refuse to accept that their children need a diagnosis. People are afraid of the unknown. No one is perfect, and I\u2019m glad these topics are talked about so much these days and that there\u2019s more help for these children. Disorders have always existed; the importance given to them now is different. But I\u2019m sure that all of us, absolutely all of us, have some mild disorder, but it exists.",

If the parents are ignorant, thinking, \u201cMy child is fine; he doesn\u2019t need a diagnosis,\u201d they only make the child\u2019s life worse, and the future that awaits them will be unpleasant.

They are irritated, frustrated, and there is no reasoning with them. They **need** their hours of sleep.\n\nSo get them in bed by a set time that works for them. It's a huge difference in how you start your morning. And a child that is tired/defiant in the morning, won't be much better for the rest of the day. \n\nIf they have had their hours of sleep, they are a lot more willingly to brush their teeth, get dressed and make your mornings and days a lot easier.\n\nAlso, when they are in bed at, let's say 7 p.m, you have an entire afternoon to either catch up with some chores or relax. Which is great for your own well-being. \n\nPicking your battles is also important. If you want to unlearn multiple behaviours, it's important not to expect a child to change it all in a day. If you keep being mad all day for every little thing, punish them for every thing, they will get frustrated, cry, and feel unsafe. It will get on your nerves. Pick 1 or 2 behaviours, ignore the rest until the first 2 are eliminated. And make sure to praise them if they show behaviour that is appreciated. A \"Well done!\" Or \"Good job!\" Is enough. No need for rewards or celebrations.\n\nI can see how both things can spiral in an endless doom of negativity, when it is actually so easy to prevent it from happening in the first place. \n\nI never thought about it that way, until I read books from a foster-carer. It made a lot of sense. But if I had not read it, I wouldn't have given these things a second thought.",

As I understand it, PDA is driven by anxiety and a need to avoid demands or expectations, while ODD can either be motivated by a desire to challenge authority or assert control (though anxiety can be a factor, it\u2019s not usually the driving factor). So they manifest and act in similar ways but for different reasons.",

Please feel free to skim, but make sure you read the last paragraph, because that\u2019s the point I am trying to make.\n\nI have a child like this, now an adult, and I have no idea where he is.   Nor do I want to know.   I have received so many diagnoses on him as a child (diagnosis is not, to say the least, an exact science).  One child psychiatrist diagnosed him with 8 concurrent conditions.   I\u2019ve heard terms such as ODD, ADHD, paranoid schizophrenia, bipolar Schizoaffective disorder, NPD, ASPD, autism spectrum, the list goes on and on.   And at one psychiatric facility (which I somehow dragged him to after he broke all my pictures and took a bat to my car), even after he threw chairs in the waiting room and verbally abused staff they ended up diagnosing him with \u201cnothing\u201d and released him back to my custody.  Whoever mentioned \u201cWe Need to Talk About Kevin\u201d, I get it\u2026 I lived this kind of fear every day.\n\nIt got worse when my husband (his father) walked out on us.   Having to handle my son on my own broke me in many ways both mentally and physically.   What ended up happening next actually saved me.  After a particularly brutal physically assault where my son tried to choke me,  I was able to get a restraining order filed against him.  The same father who ditched us both was forced, by law, to take custody of him.   To my ex\u2019s credit and discredit (as he blamed me for my son\u2019s behavior), he really tried to help my son but ended up failing repeatedly as well.   \n\nDetention, Juvie, psych facilities turned into more psych facilities, Jail, and homelessness. Cycle, cycle, endless cycle.   My son\u2019s verbal abuse and threats have continued and I had to stop all communication.   He terrifies me.  I really hope I don\u2019t cave, as I have done countless times before, as cutting off all contact has done wonders for my personal health and well-being. \n\nBut this is my main point of replying to this post:  My son has two full-blooded siblings who are extremely successful, loving, normal adults.  They were all raised the same way.  It\u2019s not you.  It\u2019s not anything you did.  You need to survive or neither of you will.",

Sorry to divert from the OP. \n\nHere are a few random observations from when he was young.  Note that starting In high school, drugs/alcohol entered the picture which made things much much worse and law enforcement had to step in. \n\nHe was very different from his siblings from the very beginning.  He was a very irritable baby.  As a toddler he was constantly throwing tantrums.  He was Impulsive.  Manipulative.  Destructive. Never followed any rules.  He actually went specifically *out of his way* to NOT follow the rules.  if someone told him to do x, he\u2019d do y.  \n\nHe was an amazing, naturally gifted athlete but was \u201cuncoachable\u201d as he always knew better than the coaches.  He was exceptionally good looking as well.  He learned from a very young age to use his looks and charm to manipulate his way through school.  \n\nHe broke bones and got stitches often and had no fear for his personal safety.  He had numerous concussions as well, which as we now know, can permanently alter the brain.\n\nI was constantly getting calls from the school and other parents about various behaviors.  Even in pre-school. Inattention, disrespect, destruction, classroom outbursts, fighting, bullying. We went to many psychiatrists, but he seemed to be able to manipulate them and I never was able to get a consistent diagnosis, the right meds or a plan for action that seemed to help. Oh, I tried.\n\nHe was an intelligent child (when he wanted to be) and got good grades until turning to drugs/alcohol in high school.  But even though he was capable of doing his own work, he went out of his way to cheat and get others to do his work for him.\n\nODD, ADHD and Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) are the only diagnosis I am 100% sure about.  His father had NPD.   But now, with years and years of drug abuse since high school, and his many concussions throughout his life, there are probably other factors. CTE?  Wouldn\u2019t doubt it.  If you ever watched the Aaron Hernandez documentary, A LOT of it reminded me of my son.\n\nI love him.  I hate him.  But I can\u2019t do anything else for him \ud83d\ude2d",

A healthy and normal family dynamic.\n\nAfter a couple of months, my grandmother took him back to the psychiatrist and they concluded he was wrongly diagnosed. He was still a bit manipulative tho. But, no longer aggressive or controlling. He listened very well to my grandmother. He no longer felt like he needed to \"fight\" for his place, he knew his place within the dynamic. \n\nMy ADD got better, a lot better, but it has always been a part of me. \n\nNow, I understand that your current situation is the way it is and you can't change the past.\nBut, it's not too late yet.\n\nIdk if you have applied boundries, a routine or if that is not a thing in your home.

Perhaps a different setting with professionals and guidance will set things straight.\n\nIf this continues, his future doesn't seem too bright. \n\nIt needs intervention. It's not too late to take that responsibility, if you can't do it yourself, then let professionals take over.

My 9yr old son with autism is so sweet and such a laid back kid so loving. The oldest is violent and destructive he has no emotions for anyone or anything unless he\u2019s hitting or hurting someone or something or himself. Somedays I wake up and just cry cause it\u2019s another day of just exhausting existing. My husband and I have not had time alone in 6 years. Nobody can handle him my only break is his 6 hours of school. As soon as I know he\u2019s coming home my anxiety gets high. I\u2019ve told my husband thousands of times that life would be manageable with our son and daughter and tried to get him into placement. But my husband really believes he will level out one day. We switch back and forth where I work and then he works but somehow he always switches spots during summer break and I hate my life when that happens. One day he will be old enough to go to a living place where they can care for him 24/7 and we can visit. I\u2019ve lost all my family and friends and it\u2019s a lonely life. I just tell myself I brought him into this world and I\u2019ll see it through til it\u2019s no longer safe and we have to make hard choices. You\u2019re not a bad person for feeling that way. I pray every night for god to take me but let him be the boy I prayed for one without struggles.",

He lives with us, but will soon be moving to a supportive environment outside our home. \n\nSome kids are truly difficult.  I did not cast him away, though I did feel OP's feelings of dismay often. \n\nMy child has a secure, safe environment with attention, care, etc, and yet he had ODD when anyone had any expectations of him. \n\nMany, many couples' relationships do not endure this life. I am quite blessed that mine did, though nothing is perfect. \n\nDo not judge unless you have walked in our shoes.",

I had to pay a bunch of money to the truancy department. I think I pulled him out at 16. By that time he was already taking off and doing his own thing. It took him seeing how lucky he was and how spoiled he was in comparison to other kids his age to stop acting like a jerk. By 19 he was back in town in his own place working. Now he\u2019s 24 going to school and lives with me. I love him too death and looking back at that period of time when I wanted to kill him is funny.

Despite that, it's important you know that your feelings aren't wrong. Feelings can't be wrong, and you are allowed to feel anything you need to, what's important is that you don't act on the negative ones in an unhealthy or destructive way.\n\nI'm sorry that things haven't turned out the way you hoped they would. The thing about parenting is that there is no manual and you never know if you'll end up with a difficult child or not, and there really isn't much you can do to prepare for that. All you can really do is make the best of whatever situation you find yourself in, no matter how hard it is, because you're responsible for another human being's well being. You don't really get to give up, no matter how much you want to.\n\nThere are some things you can possibly do though. If it's an option available to you, please seek therapy, for yourself and your child. There may be low cost options in your area if you look it up if you can't afford a therapist. I also think it would be in your child's best interests to try and get them on medication as well. I know people don't like the idea of putting  young children on meds, but it seems to me like your child is in desperate need of help, and if they already are taking medicine, then it's clear that it's not working and you need to set up an appointment with their doctor to find different meds.\n\nI really hope things get better for you and your child.",

They need intensive therapy and medication. Without it, they are NIGHTMARES and it will only get worse if you do nothing. The pipeline from untreated ODD to juvenile detention is real and it\u2019s only a matter of time before he goes through puberty and begins fighting and destroying other people\u2019s property. He\u2019s young so usually he will be given the diagnoses of ODD but he could have a mood disorder. After 9 months to a year of treatment, many of these kids were unrecognizable. And if he doesn\u2019t get his stuff together at the first one, they suggest lateral replacement. Now once you get in to 2nd, 3rd, and 4th placement, you do risk institutionalizing your kid and that comes with its own problems but I think 1-2 stays usually helps unless your kid has other major psych issues beyond behavioral. This is hard for a lot of parents, trust me. I\u2019ve seen parents break down in treatment meetings because they just want their kid to act right. I\u2019ve watched a teenager actively manipulate their parent into believing that they are cured and to end their treatment early. It\u2019s important to pick a facility that is well managed. Picking a bad facility will help your kid learn new ways to terrorize people and manipulate people to get what he wants. This route may sound harsh but I think you need to consider an inpatient program before things get worse.",

Kids can tell that the bonding is missing from a parent even at a young age, and that can lead to many behavioral problems. Not saying the problem is you but if you had trouble connecting when the child was younger that could make these behaviors worse.

It\u2019s good that you let loose here; it\u2019s therapeutic.\n\n There\u2019s no manual for being a good mother. Motherhood is difficult; any woman who says it\u2019s easy is a lie. Your drive to be a mother was enormous. It was best to see a therapist before making the decision to become one. I mention this because you felt a void, something missing in your life. Now you hate your son, but the question is, are you taking care of your son entirely? The correct thing here is that your husband also helps with your son\u2019s responsibilities, since he is his father. I would understand if you were responsible for 100% of your son\u2019s care if you were a single mother, but you\u2019re not. \n\nA child with this type of disorder requires twice as much of your time, energy, and patience, in addition to the normal parenting required by a regular child. Basically, your life is lost in this situation. Many marriages don\u2019t work because there\u2019s no balance between caring for the child and the parents\u2019 life as a couple. Everything wears thin, and if you and your husband aren\u2019t on the same page, your marriage will end. Both of you should be involved because it\u2019s important for your child\u2019s growth. If you only care for your child, you\u2019ll end up stressed and run away from your life. Inform the therapist and psychiatrist about your child\u2019s behavior and whether they require any other medication. Get your husband involved too, so you can rest. Consider hiring cleaning staff.\n\nI imagine your son\u2019s therapies involve outdoor activities and many manual activities that require keeping his mind occupied. If your son is involved in these kinds of mischief (scribbling on walls, throwing your personal belongings), you need to be firm and hold him accountable for everything he destroys. Beyond this disorder, he\u2019s still a child, and as parents, you should instill in him tasks he can do. You need to be aware that your son will enter puberty in a few years, and it\u2019s important to try to guide him on a path that will help him develop, because after that, it will be too late for you and your son.\n\nMy dear, You might also want to see a therapist. You need to release all your emotional burdens. Don\u2019t give up. If your son gets worse, talk to his psychiatrist about what to do. Perhaps he can recommend an institution for your son. Good luck. I sincerely hope this situation improves for you, your son, and your husband. I know your son also deals with many mental issues that prevent him from being aware of many things. I wish your entire family peace of mind and spirit.Take care\u2764\ufe0f\u2728",

Hope this helps you n if you have already heard all this I apologize.\n\nParenting a child with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) can be extremely challenging, especially when traditional treatments like therapy and medication don\u2019t seem to make a difference. Since kids with ODD often resist authority and struggle with motivation for change, a different approach is needed. Here are some strategies that might help:\n\n1. Shift the Focus to Relationship Over Control\n\nInstead of trying to force compliance, focus on building trust and connection. Kids with ODD often dig in their heels when they feel controlled, so emphasizing collaboration rather than punishment can help.\n\t\u2022\tEmpathize first: Acknowledge their feelings, even if you don\u2019t agree.\nExample: \u201cI see you\u2019re really upset right now. Do you want to talk about it?\u201d\n\t\u2022\tPick your battles: Not every argument is worth having. Focus on the most important behaviors rather than trying to control everything.\n\n2. Adjust Expectations & Consequences\n\nChildren with ODD are often unmotivated by typical rewards and punishments, so logical consequences and natural motivation work better.\n\t\u2022\tUse \u201cWhen-Then\u201d Statements: Tie what they want to what you need them to do.\nExample: \u201cWhen you finish your homework, then you can have screen time.\u201d\n\t\u2022\tStay calm and neutral: Don\u2019t get into power struggles. State the rule and let them choose.\nExample: \u201cYou can throw your shoes, but if you do, you\u2019ll have to pick them up before we go outside.\u201d\n\n3. Build Internal Motivation\n\nSince external motivators (punishments or rewards) may not work, try to increase their sense of control over their choices.\n\t\u2022\tGive choices: Instead of demanding compliance, offer two options that both work for you.\nExample: \u201cDo you want to do your homework at the table or on the couch?\u201d\n\t\u2022\tHelp them see consequences naturally: Instead of fighting over brushing teeth, let them experience the natural consequence of bad breath or a cavity.\n\t\u2022\tEncourage strengths: Help them develop skills or hobbies where they can feel successful. Kids with ODD often feel like they\u2019re always \u201cin trouble\u201d\u2014giving them a sense of competence can help.\n\n4. Reevaluate Therapy Approaches\n\t\u2022\tIs therapy engaging? Some kids with ODD resist traditional therapy but respond better to experiential therapies like equine therapy, art therapy, or sports-based counseling.\n\t\u2022\tFamily therapy may be more effective than individual therapy, as ODD is often intertwined with family dynamics.\n\n5. Consider Underlying Issues\n\nODD often occurs alongside ADHD, anxiety, trauma, or mood disorders. If therapy and medication aren\u2019t working, it might be worth reassessing if the diagnosis is complete.",

Then when we made a sufficient enough mess the two of us together proceeded to mop up the water on the floor. My kid is not afraid to make a mess and is willing to clean it up after knowing they're not going to get in trouble. However my brother's kid continues to make a mess knowing they're going to get yelled at then throws a tantrum repeating the cycle over and over again.\n\nEvery moment my kid is home my energy is spent trying to figure out what to do with them while continuing to do things at home making meals doing laundry cleaning all things my kid joins in on. Finding the right activities for them to do all day making sure they spend time outside is essential including the food they eat is so important to their well-being.

I think you need to get some support for yourself in order to support and get him the support he needs. After the frustration eases you need to show some concern for your child and some curiosity around why he is being like this and what he needs in order to settle into himself.  A lot of the times when a child is acting up, there is often a need that is not being met and  that\u2019s coming up with his behaviour, so right now your child needs lots of support and patience and you need support in order to care and be that support for him. \n\nPlease get some help for yourself and your baby.
