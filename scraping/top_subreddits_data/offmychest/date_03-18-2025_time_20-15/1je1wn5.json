Doesn't matter where I am, it's sitting in a chair and using computer all day long that just wreaks havoc on my mind, body, and soul\n\nIt\u2019s not even about hating my job. I know I like what I do. But its brutal when my physical toll of being desk, mental exhaustion of staring at endless code, emails. I\u2019ve tried everything... midday walk, coffee break, background music. And still... by 5 PM, I feel like nothing work at all. Has anyone suffered similarly? Did anything help?",

I've got 25ish more years until I can \"retire\". That means I'll have worked 40 hours a week for over 50 years. And that's if I'm lucky enough to ever retire!\n\nI still haven't worked out how to process that.",

But even with a shortish commute (25 mins each way), I am out of the house from 6:45am to 6:15pm every day. Morning \"free time\" is spent feeding the cats, showering and dressing for work. Evening \"free time\" is spent making dinner, cleaning the kitchen, tidying up the house, and by the time I actually get to relax and enjoy being home it's usually after 8pm. I get a few hours with some tv or a book before it just...starts all over again? \n\nInsert anything else in there (workout, errand, hobby, meet up with friend, etc.) and the day is pretty much (unsustainably) filled to the brim. For example, my boyfriend and I eat dinner with his mom every Tuesday night. It's super fun and I love not worrying about dinner, but we go over right when I get home from work and stay until about 9pm. So every Tuesday is like a wash, where I'm working all day then socializing until bed. I'm a homebody and an introvert. Add in some well-managed anxiety and depression and any activity spent outside the house feels like MORE work!",

Thanks to an extremely emotionally supportive wife, I was encouraged to walk out before having a complete mental breakdown and haven\u2019t looked back since.  I was missing out on family & personal life completely.  I had no mental capacity for non-work items.  I lived to work.  \n\nI don\u2019t have days off cause I\u2019m always on call for emergency items, it\u2019s the nature of the business, but I have a lot more flexability every day.   And it\u2019s the same for all my staff.  I don\u2019t care what they do during their shifts.  Play games, go golf, go run errands, hang out with family/friends, do whatever you want during your shift, just make sure you do the work when it\u2019s there to be done.  Then go back to whatever you want to do.  The happier and mentally healthy my staff is, the more positive feedback I get from clients.  \n\nThere are pros and cons to this, and it\u2019s not for everyone, but it works for me and my crew.  Example - My 5yr old son wants to learn to fish.  So yesterday we were at the lake fishing for a couple hours.  I had to take 2 calls and hop on my laptop for 10 minutes to resolve a couple things during that time.  I had to pull over on the drive home and reset some equipment for another client.  Then later on at home as I just got done cooking dinner, I had to go resolve network conflicts for half an hour while my family ate without me.  The trade offs are worth it to me and my family that I\u2019m able to be far more present in day to day life, but I have to stop what I\u2019m doing to get work done when it\u2019s there.  \n\nAlso, a key thing for me was finding something that allows your brain to not focus on work related items in your downtime.  I have ADHD & Anxiety, I tend to hyperfixate / overthink, so it\u2019s a huge improvement to my QOL to get my brain to shut up for a bit as often as I can.  For me it\u2019s cycling and running.  I enjoy both activities and I\u2019m so focused on form / breathing / heart rate zones / etc, that I don\u2019t put thought to work topics during those times.",
