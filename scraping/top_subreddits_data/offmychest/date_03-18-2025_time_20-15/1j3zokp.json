If you encounter someone breaking this rule, disengage and report them.\n\nWe do not insult, antagonize, interrogate, invalidate, or criticize the original poster (OP), even when not directly addressing OP.\n\n**Rule 2: No oppressive attitudes and language.**    \nWe do not tolerate oppressive attitudes and language. This includes but is not limited to content we determine to be sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, classist, ableist, or intolerant of non-dominant religions.\n\nSlut-shaming, victim-blaming, and body-policing are unsafe actions.\n\nSuicide guilting is not allowed. Follow best practices when encountering people at-risk.\n\nNo proselytizing.\n\nPromoting, supporting, and recruiting for groups that oppose our goals will also result in a ban.\n\n**Rule 3: We stay on-topic.**   \nThis is a support community.\n\nPosts must seek emotional support for matters directly related to OP and expressed in a way for people to provide it. Any matter OP cannot easily tell or get support from people they personally know is allowed.\n\nPosts should be entirely self-contained text and contain no links.\n\nAll comments must constructively support OP. Do not give advice on posts flaired No Advice Wanted (NAW).\n\nIf a megathread exists, all related posts should be placed there.\n\n**Rule 4: We reject harmful behaviors.**    \nNo personal information.\n\nNo harassment. We do not mention non-public people, fellow users, or other subreddits.\n\n**Rule 5: We cooperate to build this community.**    \nModerators err on the side of safety. For all concerns about the community moderators will discuss it privately in modmail.\n\nBeing uncooperative is a distraction for OP and will be remediated in modmail.",

Scientific research and development is being stifled and destroyed. More and more diseases are spreading. Nature will be destroyed by corporations. The orange shitler destroying America will make it impossible to live. Capitalism and Democracy is dead and were heading toward a technofeudalistic society or a total societal collapse. I would rather die than live as a slave to corporations. If there is nothing to look forward to in the future, then what even is the point of living? Isn\u2019t that just prolonging suffering? I\u2019m having more and more suicidal thoughts. I don\u2019t see the point of being alive when the cost of living is so high and I can\u2019t even afford to live anymore.

Boo hoo. Lots of people are struggling now.\n\n\nI'm so angry. I didn't apply to federal positions because I saw this coming, and I couldn't afford to weather that layoff right off the bat. And now the environmental jobs I wish I was in, that I'm applying for, I'm going to have to compete against people who have better resumes than I do. Because a lot of the early stuff that gets your foot in the door, I *couldn't* do. Either because I was trans, or because I didn't have a car, or because I couldn't afford unpaid work.\n\n\nI taught myself R in my father's hospital room. I taught myself plant ID while biking everywhere for a year with my groceries on my back because I couldn't afford a car. I figured out how lift worked in an airfoil when I was 16 and in calc I, before I'd even taken physics, because my advisor ignored me when I said the Navier Stokes equation was too advanced for me - so I chewed on those goddamn equations until they made sense.\n\n\nThe federal application process is notoriously labyrinthine, and as a trans people I couldn't even get my foot in the door - all those scholarships and programs for underprivileged groups didn't think to include my demographic, and by the time they started adding fields to include people like me I'd already aged.\u00a0\n\n\nI hate how people get rewarded over and over for either *failing* to risk assess, or having the kind of privilege where they don't need to.

Of course I understand that there may be people who think that he deserves that for various reasons, and of course I grasp where they would be coming from; but the thing really is: I think Elon is a fairly regular guy, with a fairly non-regular life. He is not the first person to spazz out because his kid turns LGBTQ, and he won't be the last. I feel like that's where his current arc begins. He feels like he lost his child, that much seems pretty straightforward. It is understandable that he would have a strong emotional reaction to this, it is perfectly regular in the sense that none of us are perfect, and we all could probably spazz out for some reason or another. I worry for his mental health nowadays. I wish people would tone it down a bit with regard to him. I worry that politics, which by nature is about that which is contentious and has a way of rousing very strong emotions, by its nature can drive people into a frenzy where they won't realize until it is too late that perhaps it was unnecessary to add that extra brick onto Elons back to carry.",
