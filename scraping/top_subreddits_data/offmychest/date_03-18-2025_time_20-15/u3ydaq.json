    "selftext": "Folks, a reminder that [Rule 3](/r/offmychest/about/rules) focuses this community's scope on providing emotional support only. We do not allow solicitation or material offers.\n\nThis means OPs cannot hint at or ask for money, and community members cannot offer money or food. There are local services that can verify and address a person's situation better than any of us can (and many services will not turn people away if they are asking for it). A kind community member offered a scammer a job and that is okay.\n\nThis community is read by millions of people, and scammers around the world know this. We have cultivated an empathic community so we know it can be hard to resist offering material help. It takes only one person to make it worth it because it costs nothing to post. That is why the rules are strictly enforced.\n\nThere are many signs of a scammer. They will present a financially desperate situation often with a highly emotional component. They are likely to mention payment services. They may have payment services in their Reddit profile and ask people to look at their profile. They will ask people to privately message them. All of these behaviors may be obfuscated with weird spacing and other ways to evade detection. If they evade detection it's up to the community to report it. Do not call out OPs, report only.\n\nThank you for your cooperation.",

My daughter responded to a Facebook posting for a rental and it was a scam. She online called the person out and then through messenger the person threaten to murder her and her Family. Put pictures of family members into the Facebook message.  It was reported to Facebook yet there\u2019s been no action and I honestly I\u2019m just disgusted on all levels angry and scared. I feel like I need an Uber geek\u2026.. yeah I\u2019m so burnt out probably going to go off Facebook and I told her to also. Yet there\u2019s a couple of groups that I really want to be part of so I\u2019m just treading water at this time.  I am actually quite scared, this person may just be a scammer from another country yet the violence threatening to kill her father,  sister and other family members was a little bit over the top and they posted pictures of these family members.  Again Facebook did not respond. I asked Facebook to deactivate the persons profile and they said no reason to, it was OK.  Thanks for your patience and reading this to whoever did. I am over the solutions and we\u2019ll just hang tight and hopefully not too many people come to break down the door.",

I also used to think of myself as a very aware of my surroundings person but since reading it I've realized I'm guilty of some of these habits. For instance getting on an elevator with a male stranger that makes you uncomfortable because you don't want to seem rude he points out what's sillier waiting a moment for the next elevator or getting into a soundproof steal box with a stranger you are afraid of. I honestly feel like EVERY WOMEN SHOULD READ THIS BOOK. I would suggest it for your daughter as well as it might make her recognize certain behaviors in the future in reference to scammer.",
