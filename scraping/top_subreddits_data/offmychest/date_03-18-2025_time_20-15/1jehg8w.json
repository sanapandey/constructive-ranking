Then, she denied it all, gaslighting me for months until I finally turned to the witness, questioning my sanity.\n\n\nI was in the right all along. \n\nI confessed my demons to my one friend who witnessed that night, who I NEVER wanted to tell about my childhood trauma. She watched me fall over with the memories flooding back. The friend I had to ask if this was true- She told me months later she remembered me breaking down in MY home after the friend who slept with him threw it in my face. \n\nShe lied, played stupid as usual, and blocked me when I confronted her. \n\n\nI was 11. \nHe didn't stop until I was 16. \nShe knew when I was 15 what he had done to me. She was almost 18. She was the one who told me I was being groomed. \n\nThe night she announced she slept with him-\n\n\u201cIf you wanted it to stop, you would have stopped it,\u201d  she said\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This girl is messed up and because what she did was so shameful she has to justify it by doing mental gymnastics and telling you if you wanted it to stop you would.  Garbage human being.  \nPlease don\u2019t allow this trash bag to live rent free in your head.  And don\u2019t carry her shame either.  You didn\u2019t deserve any of this, from the abuse to the betrayal.  You deserve to heal from this.  Focus on your mental, emotional, physical and spiritual health.   I am sorry that you went through this.  I wish you the best.  Good luck!",

But be yourself be honest and you will meet good people, friends, spouses etc.",
