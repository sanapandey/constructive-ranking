It's not that easy and not everyone is from US!! In many countries especially asian it's normal to not move out till 30 or even after that. Especially for girls, it's not even safe to live alone especially at a young age. People here need to have a broader mindset about this. ",

Add to that doing it while you are completely broke.  \nIn no way am I saying that you do not have valid reasons for your desire to leave. It is just smarter when logically weighing the positives and negatives of the two choices and the almost inevitable outcome. (That you'll end up right back there at home anyway)  \nsit down, think about what actually needs to happen in the house in detail rather than \"she is just so negative\". Flesh it out. List some details.  \nIt wouldn't hurt at all to speak to a counselor at school or a friend that you consider \"adulting\" well enough to get by.  \nCommunication, when it actually happens can resolve almost anything when both parties care about the outcome for the other and not just for themselves.",
