    "selftext": "my girlfriend got a double eyelid surgery and altered abit of her nose as well. all this happened maybe 2-3 weeks ago and while her wounds are healing, sometimes i feel like i don\u2019t recognise her anymore, and she\u2019s not the person i made memories with. i know this sounds bad and i do truly love her for everything that she is but i do get slightly sad sometimes that she permanently looks different now.

And the confusion of not recognising her as the same person. It sounds very understandable to me. Many people identify others by how they look. Maybe you have seen the videos of dad's shaving their beards and surprising their young children and the children then crying and going to their mom?\nI can imagine it may take a bit to reconnect the inner image you have of her that is now not fully accurate to the external reality and make like an update inside.\u00a0",

But I do understand you\u2019re sad that you\u2019ll never see the first face you fell in love with. I think with time you\u2019ll learn to love her new face. Especially if it brings her confidence.",
