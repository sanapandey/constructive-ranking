    "selftext": "(TW mentions of rape)\n2 years ago today, I was raped.\nIt took me a while to actually come to terms with the fact that that was what actually happend.\n\nI dont remember much about it though. I was almost blackout drunk, I couldn't walk straight. But I remember enough to know what happend.\n\nAnd I felt horrible about it for a long while. I hate myself and I was so embarrased because I got too drunk and let that happend to me. Exept I didn't let it happend? Someone took advantage of a way to drunk girl that was just waiting for her friends outside the club.\n\nI dont like the fact that I dont remember his face, or anything about him really. But I also find some kind of comfort in it. The city I live in is not that big, and I can't even imagen the big lump I would have in my stomach all day, the fear I would constantly feel.\n\nBut I'm somewhat okay nowadays, but today is just a little harder.",

Dont remember much but enough to know what was going on wasnt right. \nIf its any consolation, a promise from a stranger, you are not alone. Since i spoke up about it ive heard so many stories from others about their experiences. It breaks my heart every time but theres peace and hope in confiding in each other. \nI hope tomorrow will look a little bit brighter for you.",
