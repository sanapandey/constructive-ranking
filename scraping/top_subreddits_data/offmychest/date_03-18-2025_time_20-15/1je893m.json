This will persist in various forms throughout your adolescence and young adulthood so I encourage you to find the people who DO see you doing the things you deem cool and to stick with them. It most likely will not be your family. Stay doing the stuff that you find cool and other cool people who see you will find you along the way.",

For a while, I resented her because the party to celebrate was almost always on her day and not mine. And even if it was for my birthday or closer to, she would still get everything. But, as time went on and we both became older, they stopped doing the shared birthday. I didn't mind it after I turned 15 or 16 cause I learned it didn't matter and I didn't need gifts to be happy, I could just get something of my own to make myself happy. Besides, my parents always provided and gave me things for my actual day, so I wasn't able to find a reason to complain anymore. I used to expect the gifts, but now I don't care if I get anything. It's nice and sweet and all, but I'm not a materialistic type of girl.",
