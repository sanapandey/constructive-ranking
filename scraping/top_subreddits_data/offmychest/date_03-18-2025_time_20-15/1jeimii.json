    "selftext": "I hate that it's not something i can talk about to a professional without risk of getting in serious trouble or having a label put on me. \n\nI called the suicide hotline once in high school after a pretty rough breakup. Back then i had no intention or anything, I just wanted someone to talk to. They said i should call this other line and hung up. It was about 11pm and i had school the next day so i didnt bother. At around 1am the police show up to check on me and despite seeing I'm okay and me explaining that i was just tired they called an ambulance to get me brought to a hospital. My family was not doing well financially and the ambulance cost set us back heavily. The relationship with my parents declined after this, all because i wanted help.\n\nIt's been years and I'm feeling much worse than I did back then. There's not a day that goes by where i don't think about taking my shotgun and doing the worst. I wanna clarify that i have no intention to, just a strong desire to if that makes sense. i have people depending on me and the thought of disappointing or worrying others outweighs the desire for suicide. But I hate that i can't talk about this to anyone, i can't even start the healing process without people freaking out, jumping to conclusions, and putting a label on me. I understand why these measures are in place, i understand there's people doing much worse than i am mentally. But i wish there was a way i could get my thoughts out and rationalize them without repurcussion. ",

Either give it to a friend to hold onto for you, or sell it at your nearest gun store. You should not have access to one of you feel any sort of desire or compulsion to use it on yourself. You can always get it back or buy another one later.",

            "body": "Therapist here: the only time someone can legally be sectioned requires 3 things: ideation, plan, and intent. Ideation is what it sounds like, you're thinking about it but that's as far as it goes. Plan is also what it sounds like, you have an idea of how to do it and that's it. Intent is the big one: you think about it, you know how you'd do it AND you are confident you're going to do it.\n\nWithout those 3 things, you cannot and should not be sectioned.\n\nIt's tricky from the clinical side, because a lot of people with intent will back off and say they don't mean it, which puts us in a weird bind: do we trust it and they might want to kill themselves and they'll go do it, or do we not trust it and consider sectioning someone who might not need it.\n\nThe bottom line is that you shouldn't be sectioned. A good, decent therapist should and would know this. I talk about suicide a TON every single day and I've only sectioned one person (which was fucking horrible for everyone involved). You can 100% talk about it. My tip is to ask your therapist, right from the start, \"what are the limits of my confidentiality?\" and they should confirm for you that it's ideation/plan/intent. \n\nFull disclaimer: I'm in America, so this could be different in other places.",
