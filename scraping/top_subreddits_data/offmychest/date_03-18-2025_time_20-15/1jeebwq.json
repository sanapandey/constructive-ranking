    "selftext": "Trigger warning for mention of CSA \n\nIt happened back in October, and nothing has come from it other than my increasing anger and frustration. \nThere was only an investigation with my daughter (8). She went and did an interview, then a month later they listened in on a phone call between my boyfriend and his dad to see if he\u2019d confess - he didn\u2019t. That seems about it. They never talked to FIL, made any arrests, didn\u2019t interview anyone who was around him, any past victims, nothing. I got a call from CPS saying it was being put on his record, a history of CSA / molestation, so if anyone looked up his record for a job, they\u2019d see it. He\u2019s 78, he\u2019s not looking for a job. \nFIL has two other kids besides my boyfriend. One son, whose daughter was also touched by FIL,  but no one believed the (now ex) wife when she told everyone what had happened. His daughter, my SIL, was my babysitter. FIL lives with her. She was watching them but left them with FIL to go pick up her husband from work when it happened. My daughter told me the moment I walked through the door to pick them up. \nSince everything has come out, no one\u2019s lives have seemed to change except ours. Both BIL and SIL continue living and interacting with FIL as if nothings happened. They, to us, openly agree with our choices to report him and stay away, but that seems to be the extent of their support. \nI\u2019m furious that everyone else is not more mad. I\u2019m so angry that it feels like no one else cares or thinks this is wrong. \nHow could you live with your father, support them, share meals with them, etc. knowing that he touches little kids, makes young women uncomfortable. (When alone with his grandsons girlfriend [early 20s] he nuzzled them bit her neck when she hugged him). \nI sit here everyday with these thoughts on loop. \nThe only people who would ever know are potential employers???? No one else with damn him for his choices because he\u2019s their father??\nI want to out him to his extended family at least on social media, but what good would that do? My daughter has so much guilt about \u201cbreaking our family apart because it\u2019s her fault\u201d and no one else seems to care. \nClearly, I need therapy.. but I just don\u2019t understand why nothings being done. \n",

            "body": "I\u2019m so sorry your daughter experienced CSA. It sounds as if information had been shared earlier it could have been prevented and that is so frustrating. Please get your daughter into therapy, Emdr has been life changing for me. I am a survivor of incest and sex trafficking by my parents and my brothers know. They continue having a relationship with my parents. It didn\u2019t happen to them so they have a hard time getting their minds around it. That\u2019s a running theme in society. People don\u2019t want to believe it\u2019s true because then they\u2019d have to change and as animals we do not like change. We are creatures of habit. We will stay in abusive relationships because it\u2019s familiar. People stay in contact with perpetrators because it\u2019s what they know. Society doesn\u2019t help with the whole forgiveness and family is family bullshit. People who cause you harm should not be in your life. I have had to cut off my brothers after they continued to defend my parents and blame me. It\u2019s hard to start over. It\u2019s scary and can feel lonely. I suggest cutting off family members that defend your FIL. If you continue to see your FIL it will damage your daughter and allow thoughts of it was her fault and/or it was ok that it happened. Society is terrified of speaking about CSA and so it kept swept under the rug because people are uncomfortable with the conversation. The secrecy around CSA is part of the problem of it continuing to happen. There was a jury trial where jury found the father guilty of raping his 10 year old but asked for no sentencing as HE had suffered enough from the trial, he was let go to go home to his tween daughter. That\u2019s how uncomfortable people are with CSA.",

Still no contact\n\nId also recommend talking with a lawyer, there maybe a way to press charges against him in a civil court or something. Make it public record\n\nAnd I\u2019m betting the police didn\u2019t do much because he threatened your daughter and so she didn\u2019t tell them the whole truth or played it down",
