Doing research online didn't really help me in person either because every woman is so different. I'd get down there and it would look nothing like what I had done my research on lol. \n\nI was also in my early 20s in college at the time, so a lot of my partners weren't very experienced in what they actually liked and how to communicate what they liked to a man. And as a young dumb guy, we all liked to pretend we were sexual superstars, so questions asking didn't happen often. \n\nThe woman I ended up marrying was also very shy about communicating sexually. But it was very important for me to make sure she was pleasured. Being older and in my late 20s, I didn't have the pride and ego of a young guy, so I just straight told her I had no idea what I was doing down there and asked ( more so begged) her to show me around. Best thing I could have ever done. \n\nSo yeah, some guys are just jerks and only care about their own pleasure. But some guys honestly don't know and are afraid to ask.",

That way, both people feel respected and satisfied.
