    "selftext": "And honestly its such a relief. I really enjoy sex so before this new relationship I had a friends with benefits who would match my sex drive for about two years. Unfortunately we would often run into the issue of me bleeding after intercourse. I went to my obgyn and she said he's bruising my cervix and causing tears while entering me. He wasn't huge by any means either, just somewhat above average but it would always be so awkward whenever he'd finally pull out and there'd just be blood. Honestly I thought it was just me being built wrong, cause I never heard of other women having this problem. Now my new boyfriend is smaller, but the difference in experience is huge. Our sex drive matches but I no longer hurt or bleed. We can have sex multiple times a night and I don't have to be sore for days after or ice myself down there. It's like a whole new world has opened itself before me.",
