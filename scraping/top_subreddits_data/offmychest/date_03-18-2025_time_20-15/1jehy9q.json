I don\u2019t know how to get out, period. I don\u2019t have options, I don\u2019t have help. Time is creeping up on me and I feel the door closing. If I could go back to 2018, I would stop all of this before it had a chance to start. Now I\u2019m stuck. And there\u2019s nothing I can do except rant about it on Reddit for 2 people to see and think,\n\n\u201cWow. What a pathetic and miserable person.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong.",

You aren't pathetic, you're human.\n\nWe are so absorbed in processing the world around us we don't know how to look inward and process what we're going through.\n\nYet we keep marching on, one step at a time.",

                    "body": "We have no money. None. I\u2019m getting constant calls from bill collectors. I\u2019m having nightmares about money. I can\u2019t sleep for more than an hour or two without waking up with my brain already spinning thoughts about how screwed we are. No matter how I look at it, I can\u2019t find a solution.\n\nSo just work right? I\u2019m certified in insurance and I\u2019m licensed in real estate. I\u2019m good at what I do, but lately I can\u2019t seem to make myself do it. Conversations that came easily before feel like slow torture. I don\u2019t want to talk to anyone. I don\u2019t want to see anyone. I can\u2019t even afford gas to go to showings anyways. \n\nJust get a normal job? I applied at a few today, but it\u2019s hard to find any work that fits around my daughter\u2019s school schedule. Hopefully I can find something and afford the gas to get there.\n\nSpeaking of gas, I\u2019m two months behind on my car payment. I\u2019m terrified of them repoing my car and I think about it constantly.\n\nWe just had to move homes again, every thing is a MESS. The only one that\u2019s going to fix it is me. And I just can\u2019t. It\u2019s too much. Looking around my home is like a physical representation of my failure.\n\nAnd we may lose this house. Already. Hasn\u2019t even been a month. But we can\u2019t pay for it. And I don\u2019t know what is going to happen.\n\nI feel like poverty is a torture and I\u2019m a piece of shit for putting my daughter through it.\n\nAll of this is complicated by the fact that I\u2019m supposed to be on bed rest. Yup. That\u2019s right. I\u2019m such a screw up that even my body is screwed up. 3rd degree intermittent complete heart block. They put a pacemaker in me in October. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m on bed rest. I\u2019m about 11 weeks pregnant. They think. They don\u2019t know. Of course I have an irregular cycle, and they don\u2019t know if something\u2019s wrong with the baby\u2019s growth or not because there\u2019s not telling how far along I am.\n\nExcept there is. Where is my partner in all of this? He\u2019s here. Sort of. He\u2019s explosive and angry. He spends all of his free time playing video games or watching something sports related. He has a job, but it doesn\u2019t pay good at all. He isn\u2019t really capable of pursing anything else just because he lacks the ambition to do so. That puts me in the position of having to provide for our family, which theoretically I should be able to do. If I could just fucking make myself work consistently. Of course it\u2019s my fault for choosing this partner. When we got together, we got pregnant quickly due to several factors. But then my mom died. She was all I really had in this world and I didn\u2019t know what to do without her. I guess I just clung to him instead. How does this relate to my due date? Well we only had sex once that month. We had sex less than 10 times last year. He has no libido. He lets me be myself, which I used to love because that\u2019s hard to find in TN, but now I know it\u2019s just because he doesn\u2019t give a shit about me or what I do as long as I don\u2019t leave him. And he knows I can\u2019t. Financially, we\u2019re bound to each other. I don\u2019t know who I hate more, him or me. \n\nI\u2019m stuck. This is ALL my fault. I made my bed, now I have to lie in it. But I can\u2019t seem to get back up. I don\u2019t even know where to start.\n\nEdit to add: if I didn\u2019t already make it beyond obvious, I have diagnosed OCD.\n\nSecond edit: why am I having another child? Beyond the fact that abortion is illegal here, I am terrified of leaving my daughter alone in this world. I just want her to have a brother or sister when I\u2019m gone. I don\u2019t want her to feel alone like I do. I can\u2019t guarantee I\u2019ll be there, but I can do this for her.",
