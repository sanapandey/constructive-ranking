She had all kinds of tools and weapons on the table, including a loaded revolver and knives, and the whole idea was any of the visitors could do ANYTHING to her within that time frame and she wouldn\u2019t fight back. People tore her clothing off and groped her, sliced her with the knife, said horrible things to her, and one participant even picked up the loaded gun and pointed it right between her eyes before setting it back down. THAT is how you do art. If your goal in art is to showcase suffering, you must be the test subject. How cruel to use piglets in such a way, passing your evil tendencies off as \u201cart.\u201d May God bless those activists who saved those poor piglets.",

Yes, art is meant to be thought provoking, and can be used to tackle/force people to face uncomfortable truths or realities, including some pretty grim stuff.\n\nWith that said, if your \"Art\" is done in such a way that it directly involves actual, literal cruelty to animals, or intentionally involves things that are likely to cause actual psychological or emotional trauma to the audience (much less anyone or any living thing participating in it), then you're going way over the line. \n\nTo me, it's no different than the Stanford Prison experiment in psychology, among many others.  When you are actively causing harm and trauma to either the participants or to anyone that observes because of what's going on, it's no longer art/science, it's active cruelty and harmful.",

Just look at Teemu M\u00e4ki; 30 years ago he became famous for beating a cat to death with a stone and filming it. Overnight, he was the talk of the day. Now, he is a tenured professor in our most prestigious art academy. A contemporary of his, already deceased Markus Copper, cut off his own arm on stage with a circular buzzsaw, and became instantly famous. His next sculpture sold for millions. At some point he made the infamous \"Six-pack of Instant Death\" -sculpture series, which were filled with armed live explosives. He then proceeded to give them for free around. Only after his death the police stepped up and confiscated the artworks and dismantled the explosives. \n\nI'm very much pro-art and culture person myself, but sometimes when you look at these schizos it becomes apparent that you don't really need any artistic talent to get by in that world, if you just have balls of steel and zero regard for well-being and safety of other beings. People love that shit.",

Do you do what the people in this story did with the pigs: steal the fish, take them home, and give them a good life?\n\nOr do you do what the people in the fish exhibit did and start pressing more buttons? Do you call the cops and make them unplug the blenders because you can't trust other people around you not to press the damn button? Do you unplug the blender yourself?

Goldfish grow nearly as big as koi and are usally recommended a tank size of minimum 60 gallons. Yes, even the small ones. It's a myth that they only grow as big as their tank. They might stay smaller on the outside, but their intestines keep growing and they basically suffocate. Goldfish properly kept easily get to 20-30 years of age.\n\nNow you could say this is only a temporary tank. But there's a second problem: goldfish are poop machines. Their waste produces ammonia, which is very toxic to fish, it burns their gills. In a normal fishtank this is mitigated by having filtration. A blender doesn't have this. So this is the fish equivalent of locking somebody up for days in a porta-potty while they're having explosive diarrhea.",

There are other ways to point out animal cruelty other than abusing them himself. Heck, he gave a couple of solutions at the end of the article.

It does turn me against the art industry however, and how THAT should be more regulated.",

(And I wish the artist would stop at take a look at things cause... he seems to be lost in his own sauce and doing the exact thing he seems to want to be criticizing.)\n\nHonestly I can't say most of the people who press the button would be \"THE assholes\" because there's room for people who look at the set up and go \"certainly this is just a bit. No one would *actually* let that happen\" and press the button expecting something else to happen, just as someone who puts a goldfish in a blender and tells people that it is a real functionioning blender that will kill the fish could reasonably assume that no one would want to risk harming the fish and would stay away from the button.  The real \"asshole\" here (imo) is the system itself. The system that allows the guilt of the result to be spread across all participants in such a way that allows them all to point to the other and say \"well that person shouldn't've done that\" instead of taking the time *before* the moment they participated in bringing the tragic result into existence to attempt to ensure a different result (like those who saved the piglets). \n\nSo tldr, The Asshole is as voltron amalgam of the artist, for their complacency in setting up a hazardous installation with no obscured safety net, the gallery owners, who allowed this installation to exist in their institution without a safety net, and the participants who either pushed the button or walked past the installation without inquiring/interfering to ensure/install a safer place for these animals, and that human tendency to talk oneself into being more comfortable with horrendous risk until it's too late to do something. And it's that last part, imo, that is where the work can more productively be done. \n\nTldr to the tldr, everyone, everyone is the asshole and we should be more active in protecting life from suffering and harm.\n\n\n(Also special mention for the motherfuckers who go in explicitly to see an animal suffer, those guys are full on problems, but I think less they are less pervasive than they are alarming, at least when compared to the above)",

(And I wish the artist would stop at take a look at things cause... he seems to be lost in his own sauce and doing the exact thing he seems to want to be criticizing.)\n\n>Honestly I can't say most of the people who press the button would be \"THE assholes\" because there's room for people who look at the set up and go \"certainly this is just a bit. No one would *actually* let that happen\" and press the button expecting something else to happen, just as someone who puts a goldfish in a blender and tells people that it is a real functionioning blender that will kill the fish could reasonably assume that no one would want to risk harming the fish and would stay away from the button. The real \"asshole\" here (imo) is the system itself. The system that allows the guilt of the result to be spread across all participants in such a way that allows them all to point to the other and say \"well that person shouldn't've done that\" instead of taking the time *before* the moment they participated in bringing the tragic result into existence to attempt to ensure a different result (like those who saved the piglets).\n\n>So tldr, The Asshole is as voltron amalgam of the artist, for their complacency in setting up a hazardous installation with no obscured safety net, the gallery owners, who allowed this installation to exist in their institution without a safety net, and the participants who either pushed the button or walked past the installation without inquiring/interfering to ensure/install a safer place for these animals, and that human tendency to talk oneself into being more comfortable with horrendous risk until it's too late to do something. And it's that last part, imo, that is where the work can more productively be done.\n\n>Tldr to the tldr, everyone, everyone is the asshole and we should be more active in protecting life from suffering and harm.\n\n>(Also special mention for the motherfuckers who go in explicitly to see an animal suffer, those guys are full on problems, but I think less they are less pervasive than they are alarming, at least when compared to the above)",

All he said was something being unethical doesn't stop it being art.\n\nRegardless of your opinions on this particular piece, it was an aesthetically inclined installation piece. The cage was specially constructed from shopping carts to push the theme visually, and the experience of seeing the pigs in inescapable danger was designed to elicit an aesthetic/emotional response. It was a sculpture with animal performers incorporated into it; it's difficult to argue that falls outside the bounds of even the most conservative definitions of art.\n\nObviously it was needlessly cruel, not to mention just kind of tacky and played out---Salvador Dali created animal enclosures as art exhibitions in the late 1930s---but it's hard to frame this as the same as a banana taped to a wall or a blank, unpainted canvas. \n\nThis is just a pretty run of the mill, uninteresting installation piece with an animal abuse element so the artist can claim to be edgy. \n\nLike the guy above who got inexplicably downvoted said: it's art, but that doesn't mean you get to use it as an excuse to hurt animals.",

I graduated from art school, but I suppose in your mind that probably disqualifies me from having my own opinion, rather than showing I know what I'm talking about. (I'm not trying to brag; this is very basic stuff.)\n\n\nTo me, it sounds naive to say that an exhibition by an artist in an art gallery is \"not art.\" Unfortunately, it makes it sound like you believe that only a painting or sculpture of a pretty woman can be art, and you're ignoring the last 100 years of art history. I hope that's not the case.\n\n\nBesides, my main point is that being animal cruelty does not disqualify it from also being art. I wasn't saying, \"Oh my god, this art is BREATHTAKING.\" I don't like it at all. But it's art. That's what it is.\n\n\nI'm interested in whether people actually think the cruelty disqualifies it, or whether they just don't like it when an installation is called art.\n\n\nIf Van Gogh's painting of sunflowers was made from the blood of massacred baby piglets, would that make it \"animal cruelty, not art\"?\n\n\nOr if the live piglets in this installation were tiny Teddy Ruxpins slowly running out of batteries, would it be art again?",

They are kept in extremely cramped conditions, surgically mutilated as piglets without anesthesia, separated from their mothers at a very early age.\n\nFor a creature as emotional and intelligent as a dog, we torture them more than even livestock chickens and cows.\n\nBut raising awareness through even more torture is wrong.",

People like their cheap meat and aren\u2019t willing to give it up. Most people are at least marginally aware that conditions aren\u2019t great but aren\u2019t willing to slow consumption. Maybe lab grown meat is the ticket to ethical sustainable meat, I dunno.\n\nTil then, those of us who do care should at least reduce how much we consume, if not cutting out pork/all meat altogether.",

The point of the exhibit is that the pigs have more piglets than the mother has teats.\n\nThis is a thing that also exists in nature. Not every baby animal is going to be able to survive when its born. Maybe for different reasons, maybe because of the same.  Many animals will intentionally discard their smaller young to be able to focus more resources on the stronger ones. \n\nSo the reality of life, or even an industry, is not cruelty. No pig farmer goes into farming pigs with the intention to cause piglets to suffer.  A piglet might suffer as a result, but then wild animals young suffer in the wild as well.  Pigs will die at the end of their life, but pigs in the wild suffer too. A pig will become food for a predator, but animals in the wild become food for predators.\n\nSomething that predators don't generally do is care about the suffering that the prey suffers before they kill it, to try to minimize it, but we do. Something that predators don't generally do is try to ensure that their prey raises healthy offspring, but generally we do. I'm not saying that raising pigs for food is morally righteous, but it's generally kinder than the wild.\n\nBut while we can be kinder than nature, we can also be crueler than nature. \n\nA predator would never simply pull three piglets from their mother to watch them starve to try to cause an emotion reaction. This is intentional pain caused for the purpose of feeling an emotion because of that pain. \n\nThis is cruelty. Few animals are cruel.  Even the animals that do things like play with their food, or kill for fun, they generally don't do it for the purpose of enjoying the suffering of their prey. \n\nEven factory farmers. While suffering might happen, they don't cause suffering to savor the feelings. It's just a result. Just like nature causes everything to die, not cruel, just reality.",

If as individuals they don't matter, than it would seem the greater critique of animal treatment/factory farming/etc is kind of without teeth because each of those individual animals wouldn't matter. \n\nTo me, this type of ethical logic works if you would also endorse essentially doing the same thing to human children to like make a point about how we need to do more to fight child hunger in the wider world. Its horrific because those kids lives matter, thus making the point that we should all be doing more. \n\nAlthough I personally appreciate a soft utilitarian approach to ethics, personally they only make sense if I put a high amount of utility on traditionally valued ideas like human rights and the value of the individual. So this sort of logic doesn't work for me, and neither would the original. Even assuming it had the hoped for effect (which it does not really seem to have).",
