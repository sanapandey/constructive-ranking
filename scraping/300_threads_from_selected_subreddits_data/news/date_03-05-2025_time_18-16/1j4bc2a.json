Eventually the market is going to come to the realization that the stable America that existed post WW2 is long dead and it will pull the plug metaphorically on America. Once the dollar stops having sway the nation is finished. When is the debt ceiling up next if Republicans and Trump are still in power I fully expect the US under Trump\u2019s command will default on its debt (cause never pays anything and he is America now in his mind) and that will be the big domino the dollar will tank and the global economy will crash. If I was a foreign government I would be consolidating towards the EU financially.",

This is all by design under the guise of \u201cstrong arm\u201d negotiations. This is twice now he\u2019s pulled this BS, and it\u2019s tarnishing our relationships with allies so Wall Street and the wealthy capitalize on the insider trading going on. Why do you think they have scrapped all oversight and regulation? Look at the crypto announcement. Stocks were trending downwards so he makes the announcement to influence the prices for the crypto bros. \n\nI suggest watching [THIS CLIP](https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/-enormous-heist-hayes-on-the-audacious-scheme-to-reward-big-donors-226432069961) by Chris Hayes.

The draw for mexico is probably, cheap labor putting things together made by more skilled, more expensive, and more unionized labor in USA or Canada.\n\nGiven a \"cheap labor\" option of China or Mexico, I'm taking Mexico every day. I like the idea of a cheap labor option that's closer to us and who is not China for lots of reasons not to like the ongoing dependence on China for cheap labor and the mostly one-way flow of funds.",
