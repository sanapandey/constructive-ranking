Not that it's new but individuals grabbing short-term gains as quickly as possible is the hottest trend at the moment and it's been obliterating industries. \n\nNobody in charge of these major corporations gives two shits about any sort of sustainable business, they just want to get whatever money they can and run. The workers will all be dead, but they won't need the workers any more at that point (other than their personal servants, who'll be taking lower rates out of desperation).\n\nIt's terrible from every angle except a single individual seeing a way for them to profit personally, but as I said, that's the practical justification. To their desired ends, it's turning out to be extremely effective and successful.\n\nBut to pretend that there's as much incompetence or stupidity involved as some do is really giving these clowns too much credit.

Sociopaths always think they deserve more or they're superior and need to keep people down. \n\nThe wealthy have spent decades tearing down what FDR setup. They knew it wasn't going to be easy to get rid of things the whole population were behind. Took a long time to poison the brains of morons with propaganda and have them hate their fellow citizens. They created a population of envious, greedy, selfish,  hateful dummies who think no one else deserves anything because they had it harder or they have nothing or they worked harder than everyone else, so they deserve more. For decades now, it's been a constant back and forth between both parties, and unfortunately, it was easier to break shit than it was to defend. There should have been a bigger focus in this country to participate in elections and how the government functions. Money wins elections because we let it happen.

Got real worried about Greed, realized I didn't understand it at all but that it was a big part of the world. Eventually ended up panicking in a professor's office about it, where he basically told me not to worry my pretty little head about it. \"Greed has never destroyed the world before and I doubt it's going to start now.\"\n\nBy the end of the degree, my faith in capitalism was shattered and I honestly thought for awhile that I'd gone insane. It seemed much more likely that I'd slipped off my rocker than that the world around me was built on such, for lack of a better word, *evil*.\n\nYa know, was like being raised Christian and slowly being turned into an atheist by reading the Bible. I honestly thought I was getting a degree in monitoring a level playing field where humanity used dollars to decide who had the best ideas. Took until literally the very last day of class before I understood I'd just earned a degree in putting smiley face stickers on corruption to make it look A-Okay.",

By the time I was 13 and actually read the parts of the Bible, I started to question the priests and nuns in my church. Got no answers to anything I asked. Tried to guilt me into believing. Went to confess my \"sins\" at 13 and was done. Looked into things myself online when AOL got popular and knew I couldn't accept it.  \n\nBy the time I graduated from high-school Clinton had his scandal, columbine happened, 9/11 affected so many friends/ and local families,  and Bush started 2 wars with false claims. Let's just say I've been jaded a long time. Apparently I liked to learn how hard I'm getting fucked and really got into politics and political history in the US. The wealthy have been destroying countries/states/continents since the beginning of time. It's always the same story in a different setting. Doesn't matter if it's capitalism, communism, fascism, the rich always need more money and power and it's always at the expense of everyone else. \nA king who is a decent person and is educated can take care of his people and have a prosperous kingdom but someone else has to take over someday and most powerful and wealthy people are not going to be like that. On paper communism sounds like a semi fair system that could work. Insert real people with certain personality types and you get the USSR. Most people would be happy with a living wage and enough to do things a few times a month with friends and family. The others are miserable no matter what they have and have to ruin it for everyone else",

It's a real mess right now in just so many ways that are entirely counter productive to working together in a healthy way. Like the version of trading I was taught was that we're supposed to try to \"get one over\" on folks, to cheat whenever possible, because to not cheat when everyone else is would be plain stupid. Dad taught me that and business school reinforced it. Still think it's disgusting and wrong and breaks useful parts of society, no matter if it is the popular line of thought.",

The San Francisco District Attorney's office wasn't even involved in this case. District attorneys and their DA offices generally handle criminal cases under state/local laws. They are not responsible for bringing civil cases against the Federal government like this. Tara M. Steeley, the Deputy City attorney, was responsible for this case - not the DA's office.\n\n2. The current District Attorney of San Francisco is still a Democrat with a fairly liberal background in many respects. She is not really conservative. Calling her a conservative because she isn't as liberal as the previous DA is like calling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a conservative because she isn't as liberal as Bernie Sanders.\n\n3. This lawsuit was approved by the leadership of San Francisco. City attorneys and DAs alike can't just unilaterally sue the federal government or challenge federal laws by themselves without direction from the mayor and other top leadership. Both the current and previous mayor and most of the city leadership are fairly liberal Democrats.",

It was about releases of sewage into the ocean during significant rainstorms when the system is overwhelmed.  The sewage discharge pipes go 3 miles out into the Pacific Ocean, so it's not like it's being discharged anywhere near a drinking supply.  \n\nThe root of the problem is that SF's sewage and run-off systems are combined.  This was done so that run-off could be treated before release and was supposed to be an environmentally-friendly initiative.  Most coastal cities just have their storm run-off go directly into the environment without treatment.  Run-off contains heavy metal, petroleum, and other contaminants that SF was wanting to treat before release. \n\nThe problem is that this system has not aged well, and was not built for the capacity it now has to handle.  Until it is *significantly* upgraded, either releases of untreated water occurs, or the local city is flooded with contaminated overflow.\n\nIt's not that SF wants to cheap out on water treatment, it's that it is balking at requiring permission and limits to release sewage in the event that the systems are overwhelmed during transitionary weather events.\n\nNow, upgrading run-off and sewer systems better equipped to handle the increasingly volatile weather events we're seeing is absolutely needed.  However, that's an effort years, perhaps decades, in the making.  In the meantime if a storm is about to overwhelm the system, releases have to happen elsewise damage that shuts down the entire system can occur, making the potential contamination orders of magnitude worse.",

The permit\u2019s conditions include prohibitions on discharges that contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards. The permit included generic prohibitions on the impacts to water quality, as part of the EPA\u2019s efforts to halt San Francisco\u2019s releases of raw sewage into the Pacific Ocean during rainstorms.\n\nSan Francisco challenged these conditions, arguing that EPA lacks statutory authority to impose them. The US Court of Appeals for the ninth circuit in July 2023 upheld EPA\u2019s authority to issue generic limits on discharges under the Clean Water Act. San Francisco took the case to the supreme court.\"",

It was about releases of sewage into the ocean during significant rainstorms when the system is overwhelmed. The sewage discharge pipes go 3 miles out into the Pacific Ocean, so it's not like it's being discharged anywhere near a drinking supply.\n\nThe root of the problem is that SF's sewage and run-off systems are combined. This was done so that run-off could be treated before release and was supposed to be an environmentally-friendly initiative. Most coastal cities just have their storm run-off go directly into the environment without treatment. Run-off contains heavy metal, petroleum, and other contaminants that SF was wanting to treat before release.\n\nThe problem is that this system has not aged well, and was not built for the capacity it now has to handle. Until it is significantly upgraded, either releases of untreated water occurs, or the local city is flooded with contaminated overflow.\n\nIt's not that SF wants to cheap out on water treatment, it's that it is balking at requiring permission and limits to release sewage in the event that the systems are overwhelmed during transitionary weather events.\n\nNow, upgrading run-off and sewer systems better equipped to handle the increasingly volatile weather events we're seeing is absolutely needed. However, that's an effort years, perhaps decades, in the making. In the meantime if a storm is about to overwhelm the system, releases have to happen elsewise damage that shuts down the entire system can occur, making the potential contamination orders of magnitude worse.\n\nAnd yes, upgrades to the system are both planned and in progress.  These are multi-billion dollar projects and it will take years to complete.  New digesters, treatment plants, pump stations, capacity increases, run-off handling, etc are being built.  In the meantime, you either release untreated sewage at sea or you overflow and flood the city with raw sewage.",

These beaches get polluted in heavy rainfall when the sewage flows into the pacific. The City says fixing this would cost $10B and drive up water costs too much in an already costly city, for only a minor improvement. No drinking water is actually at issue, its over recreational spaces/activities. \n\nCity counsel had a vote last year to drop the suit because the City's supervisor pointed out that the Supreme Court was using cases like these to undermine the EPA beyond the remit of the cases. Sadly, it didn't pass and this was the consequence they warned about. Sackett II is another example from last year (when they determined the Clean Water Act only covered wetlands when there was a permanent continuous surface water, which most wetlands don't have). The court has extended it in this case by applying it to all fresh-water and actual drinking sources, not just the beaches, and the EPA now has to do a ton more work to be specific with each permit.",

The EPA intended to hold San Francisco responsible for ocean water quality in an area where raw sewage from the city washes into the ocean during heavy rain. The EPA gave the city a permit, but in addition to limits on the type and amount of pollutants, it included \"end-result\" provisions that made the city responsible for meeting a water quality standard. According to the majority opinion, \"When a permit contains such requirements, a permittee that punctiliously follows every specific requirement in its permit may nevertheless face crushing penalties if the quality of the water in its receiving waters falls below the applicable standards.\" That was a very real possibility in this case given the city isn't the only agency that releases pollutants in that area. Nothing prevents the EPA from performing its basic function of setting and enforcing limits on pollutants.\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-san-francisco-water-pollution-6874dc505a394d9181b17a0aef41406f",

Unfortunately, combined sewer systems simply cannot cope with storms. Some of the wastewater is always going to be discharged every time. It's almost unavoidable. The good-ish news is that the water released during a storm is 90-95% rainwater.\n\nA huge problem is nitrogen removal, I wouldn't be surprised to see lawsuits directly connected to that if this lawsuit isn't. That's a whole different level of cost to fix. \n\nPfas removal is another EPA goal. It's utterly implausible and really should be a source control issue.\n\nThe municipalities that discharge into fresh water are the ones to be more concerned with, especially when all the worst polluting industries seem to have been on board with this bill.",

If the regulations are suddenly gone, they realize they're going out of business if they don't massively improve.\n\nAnd I like to point out regulations didn't always exist. It used to practically be a free for all (like this guy wants) and that is absolutely 100% not what happened. It wasn't unusual to have glass or other debris in food you bought because there were no regulations against it. Spill food on the floor in a factory? Fuck it. Pick it up, dump it back in with the rest. We can't be losing money by not selling it.\n\nAlso, if \"the race to the top\" would happen without regulations, it'd be happening with them as well. Companies aren't going to suddenly decide they have to be the best possible when they just had regulations removed. \n\nTrying to explain it to this dude was futile and he just kept insisting I'm an idiot and had no idea what I was talking about and also that I should leave this to the experts (as in, him specifically.) To sum it up in a few words, his attitude was \"I'm right because I say I'm right.\"",

We talked politics a lot in my house. My parents would lightly tease me and say \"if you're not a liberal when you're young, you're heartless. If you're not a conservative when you're old, you're brainless\". I understand of course what they meant by that, but I've come to think it's quite the opposite\n\nBeing progressive means thinking beyond yourself. To some extent de prioritizing or giving up on the idea of self sufficiency and independence. Which are scary thoughts. But it's part of growth and maturity to accept them. I think perhaps if you're not a progressive when you're older, you never really properly matured.",

            "body": "To be specific, they struck down nonspecific/general permits.\n\nAs best I can tell this is how it worked: For example, a city might have several municipal water treatment plants that are all doing the same thing, with basically the same chemicals, and releasing into the same body of water. Instead of having to permit each facility individually and develop individual standards, the EPA would issue a general permit for the collective facilities saying that in total you had to meet X standards and couldn't disrupt the body of water by whatever measure used. The point was that each facility didn't matter alone as long as the system overall met requirements.\n\n[Enter San Francisco](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/justices-questioning-shows-high-stakes-for-wastewater-permits), who dumps raw sewage during overflow events into the Pacific. This used to be common practice and a lot of cities did it. Essentially the storm sewer and wastewater run in one big pipe to the plant, but that pipe is split so that if it rains too much, the excess the plant can't handle goes down a separate branch and gets dumped into a body of water. Over the last 50ish years cities have been phasing this out as they've had to replace sewer lines and I think at some point they became illegal for cities over a certain size and that cities had to develop plans for replacing theirs.\n\nSan Fran hasn't been making good progress on fixing this apparently. The EPA began to enforce fines because they cannot get their overall system to meet requirements for total amounts of raw sewage dumping. So, now the EPA must develop specific standards for each facility, individually. It's putting the onus of figuring out how the city will treat its wastewater on the feds instead of the municipality being responsible.",

I don't know what that looks like, but my basic googling found a FAQ on the EPA site which cites a minimum 6 month processing time for the permit application. Reading the material it sounds like they need to calculate how much of which pollutants each site is able to dump in order to be considered safe and setting up procedures for testing & reporting.\n\nThis'll probably effect local governments more than private industry.

Overturning of Chevron in Loper Bright did not mean that agencies are not allowed to come up with their own rules. Chevron deference means the courts must default to treating the agency interpretation of law as canonical. Without Chevron, the standard only relaxes slightly to Skidmore deference, in which the agency's interpretation is still assumed to be the controlling interpretation, but must be justified with \\*when challenged.\\*\n\nWhen it's challenged, the courts consider the following (still granting an assumption of good faith):\n\n* The thoroughness of the agency's investigation\n* The validity of its reasoning\n* The consistency of its interpretation over time\n* Other persuasive powers of the agency\n\nOverturning agency rules under the Skidmore standard still gives massive deference to the administrative agencies, and any rules that are justifiable as given by scientists and industry professionals can easily meet that standard.\n\nBut it still starts with an assumption that agencies' interpretations of laws are correct. That's how we do all laws- for example police departments must interpret laws to enforce them- they don't wait for a judicial ruling. Our judicial system is constructed to correct interpretations only when challenged in court.",

It's about the permit that EPA issued to a municipality that is generally charged with responsibility over treating and disposing of their public's sewage being too vague to ensure compliance. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits are issued under the Clean Water Act. In short, if you don't have a NPDES permit, you can't be a pollution point source into the waters of the United States. But if you do have one, you can as long as you comply with the terms of the permit. Think of it this way: You have a driver's license. The driver's license says you can drive no faster than 60 mph on the highway. OK, fair, that's easy enough to understand and comply with. But then it says you cannot drive in a way that contributes to traffic. That's a lot less clear. How do you know if you're contributing to traffic? Well, the police would like you to report back on how you're driving, and at some point if they decide that the way you're driving is contributing to traffic, they will sue you for being in violation of your driver's license and also seek penalties against you somewhere around $60,000 per day for every day they decided your driving contributed to traffic. That was San Francisco's issue with their permit. They didn't think they or their taxpayers should be made to pay for violating a term they didn't know they were not compliant with until EPA someday decides that they aren't. \n\nI'm absolutely not saying that raw sewage in drinking water is good. No one wants that. But this situation seems way more like an overreach being brought into line and it is just going to be the regulatory agency's responsibility to provide clear language in its permits, which is not unreasonable. Is that going to be really hard with the Trump administration's overt actions and goals? YES. It will be basically impossible. In a perfect world I would want the outcome of this opinion to be executed by a fully staffed, fully equipped EPA that can devote the appropriate resources and analysis to ensuring their permits are clear. But that wasn't the question presented to the court.\n\nI am absolutely not happy that I actually agree with the likes of Alito, Roberts, Thomas, and Kavanaugh on this. All in saying is, rein in the manufactured outrage so that we can look at the facts and draw a reasonable conclusion from there.",

            "body": "It's not about sewage, it's about science. You can't deny climate change without dismantling all the other sciences, because if one science is up and running, climate change is a factor. If you plan to destroy the planet for profit, you need people to not think about the ongoing climate change. You need it to not be real. In the US climate change is a matter of opinion, and it's a left-leaning opinion. They want to keep it that way.\u00a0\u00a0  \nSewage treatment is expensive, and it\u2019s just gotten worse. What in the beginning was just the expense of \"grate on end on tube\" is now a highly sensitive machinery and tons of lab work. Lab work is expensive, because you have to pay for the lab, for the lab to be running, for the things in the lab, and the highly educated people inside the lab.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \nThe more we know, the harder it is to treat sewage. Sewage is a major problem in antibiotic resistance. We know sewage is a problem when it comes to the spread of a lot of diseases, not just the normal e-coli and stomach bugs stuff, it's a factor in almost all pandemics. And hey, did you guys know that bird flu has become endemic in rats in the US; commonly found in and around sewage. Rats are usually the last step before humans, so there's that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \nThis means the expense is not just running plants, and doing tests, and all the mechanics, it also means there's additional, huge expenses in figuring out sewage. Sewage is really dangerous. There's so much science behind how you handle and treat sewage, and it's an ongoing fight. People don't think about it, but sewage treatment is extremely important for human health. People flush and think the issue is over, but it's not. Not by far. And in the US it's a bigger problem than people think, because Americans are notoriously bad at flushing stuff that shouldn't be flushed, fatbergs in the system are a big problem in the US and diseases can live and mutate there. Looser rules, means less labs, less funded projects, less science, les scientists, less people checking, less people talking. They are rolling back on science.\u00a0  \nSewage science is harsh; it doesn't really care about your feelings. Sewage science is clear; climate change is real, it's a problem for individual human health. You can't convince sewage science to change its mind about this, because its been visible for a long time. Water doesn't have memory, but it talks loudly about what's going on right now.  \nThis is not just how much raw sewage that's allowed in freshwater; but also how high bacterial load, parasitic load, etc that's allowed, and it's about how many chemicals are allowed to potentially kill off bacteria and parasite which is bad news because that's incredibly unstable. Working with sewage is not sexy, but it's one of the most important part of science we have because it is 100% imperative to human health and survival that we figure out how to do it safe, how to protect our water (only 3% of the water on the globe is fresh water, only 1.2% is drinkable) and how to hinder resistant bacteria. Safe water is the biggest indication of a healthy population.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \nHuman health is considered a private matter in the US; you are healthy because you did things right, you are unhealthy because you did things wrong, you have access to health care because you did things right, you do not have access to health care because you did things wrong. So it's not difficult for the American government to go \"well, bad health due to bad water is a matter of personal responsibility!\" and people will agree. If you live somewhere with bad water, you should make more money and move.\u00a0  \nIt's a lot easier and cheaper to get Americans to buy bottled water than it is to treat the increasing issue and danger that is sewage. This is also great for a lot of government sponsors, like Nestle. Nestle sells bottled water for over 4 billion dollars in North America every year.\u00a0  \nThis will lead to an increased rate of diseases, and it will lead to an increase in infant mortality. But that doesn't matter to the people who make money off this; they've been cool with this all the time. Look at how they treat the post-colony countries they still own industry and mines in? They don't care that there's massive child mortality, they don't care that the people are sick and dying. There's still going to be enough people for them to exploit.\u00a0",

It's like having no red-painted curbs, but having laws saying \"don't park too close to this or that\", then handing out tickets subjectively based on the police officer's opinion on what \"too close\" is.\n\nMaybe people should read stuff directly since so much information is available?",

Here\u2019s what I gathered and someone can correct me if I\u2019m wrong: \n\nThe ruling means the EPA cannot issue blanket nonspecific regulations for sewer water discharge via clean water act. It has to issue specific guidelines for sewer discharge - presumably on a case by case basis.  \n\nThis ruling is favorable for the city that challenged it - San Francisco - which is ironically one of the most liberal cities in one of the most liberal states in the US. \n\nSan Francisco basically wanted a pollution permit that was tailored to their specific need, and not a blanket recommendation from the EPA by way of CWA, in regards to discharging rainwater sewage into the Pacific Ocean. \n\nAlso, ironically, Amy Coney Barrett dissented against the super majority along with the democratic justices. \n\nIt\u2019s not clear that this will directly affect the CWA but it does limit the EPAs ability to issue non-specific pollution permits moving forward, which I assume means they\u2019ll have to issue permits that are tailored and specific on a case by case basis. \n\nHonestly I\u2019m not sure what to make of this article and headline. It\u2019s clear most of the commentors here didn\u2019t read the article. And the headline isn\u2019t totally accurate either. Kind of a mixed bag IMO.",

It keeps people from making judgments based on the filtered version that they read in the news. I\u2019m not saying this story isn\u2019t factual or that I disagree with it, because I haven\u2019t read the opinion or the dissent, and I live only about ten minutes from work, so I\u2019m way behind on listening to the raw SCOTUS arguments on the Oyez podcast, but I make it a point to reserve judgment until I read the opinion.\n\nSCOTUS opinions are the *only* reason I miss Scalia. I disagreed with his opinion almost every time, but god*damn*, that guy could write an opinion or dissent (his banter in an argument was great, too). Thomas also writes pretty good opinions (disagree with them, too), and when I started reading opinions, I thought he was just a guy who sat on the bench and asked one question every five or seven years, but he\u2019s actually a pretty intelligent jurist. Wrong and corrupt, but intelligent.

The EPA does NOT have congressional authority to apply \u201cend-result\u201d requirements (holding the permit holder accountable for the actual quality of the body of water they are discharging into) to permit holders. This is extremely important because (as the Court even says in their narrative) a organization could technically be strictly following the requirements for their water discharge and doing everything right, yet a test of the water body could show the quality of the water body they are discharging into is not up to standards.
