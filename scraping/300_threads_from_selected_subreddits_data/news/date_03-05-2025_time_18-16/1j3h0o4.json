In a little over one month. This list of objectives for dismantling the government that we found out about and warned people about that everyone else said wasn't real or wouldn't happen or \"trump said (lied) he doesn't know the heritage foundation people\" blah blah, is fucking real and is exactly what we warned was going to happen. And yet people voted trump or didn't vote bc Kamala wasn't perfect or some \"both sides\" bullshit. Don't let anyone forget this was preventable.",

He just so happens to agree with Project 2025 on dismantling the Administrative state, and so does Elon Musk. \n\nTrump and Musk, however, aren't patient enough and don't have the legal background to wait on all the appeals to go through, which puts the entire strategy at risk.",
