It is a monster, that kills, that cares not for neither culture of the collective or the individual, nor does it care for mercy, respect, tolerance or love; it is a horrid horrific monstrous creature that ruins mankind.\n\nThat is the arc I've been on as of late lol.",

That is in essence my economic take, that society would be best, if we lived more simply and were able to use our talents to produce and own things with our own hands, I would never want to legislate this, nor would I desire it being forced upon others.\n\nEven than I find flaws within it, back to what you were saying, I look at history, I see the pain that all economic systems have brought with them, free market systems and the poverty that comes with them, state managed systems and the over burden of bureacracy and management of other peoples lives, the wanton violence of Anarcho-Communist systems and its brutality to those that do not think like them, I look at economic systems and all I see are wanton death and cruelty, this doesn't even mention pre-industrial economic modes.\n\nFor me, I cannot trust the human economy, for it along with the Human State, has been the second worse oppressor of mankind in our entire history right behind Satan himself.",

So poor people can have access to quality healthcare? That's a very nice warm fuzzy feeling but....  \nHave you ever seen a Medicaid nursing home? The old people are basically prisoners left to slowly die alone. Uncared for by overwhelmed and underpaid \"nurses\". Some of them are abused and stolen from. It's incredibly sad. Maybe Americans shouldn't just dump their elderly parents into an institution to be rid of them. Maybe there is room for a private charity, or even a for profit organization, to step in and pay for these services. They could have much better quality control and standards of care - and they would be much more efficient. Maybe instead we should offer people vouchers, like the school choice advocates suggest. People could choose the facility that treats them the best, and the best facilities will get the money. The bad facilities will close. \n\nHave you ever been on Medicare? Most places that actually accept medicare are not conveniently located, and are incredibly busy and understaffed. Overwhelmed and underpaid nurses and doctors don't care about you and treat you like they don't care. Doctors will offer you treatments and prescriptions you don't need because they get paid to sell you those drugs and do those procedures. There were almost 100,000 opioid overdoses in 2024. Who gets hooked on the drugs in the first place? It's poor people in Appalachia and other economically devastated areas. Who pays for the prescription opioids that get them hooked? You, and I, and every other tax payer funding Medicare.\n\nThe Libertarian argument isn't \"abolish healthcare\" - it's \"let the best healthcare providers be rewarded so they can provide more and better healthcare\". The healthcare system in America isn't messed up because of the free market, it's messed up because the government has gotten involved in that market.",

We can't pull the rug out from under these people. Also, we let anyone not currently using Medicaid opt out of the whole thing, or continue until they die. If they choose to opt out, and they have paid in with any taxes at all, they can receive a check for that amount that they've paid in. They can now contribute that money to a High Yield Health Savings Account, or purchase another form of private insurance. You could even make it a voucher, so it can't be spent on drugs or gambling or whatever. \n\nThe people on medicare will lose their medicare, but they can pay for a private insurer if they're not forced to pay it out of their paycheck, since they'll have more money. The most expensive part of healthcare is routine healthcare, not catastrophic accidents - and old people require WAY more routine healthcare. Doctors visits and prescription drugs add up. Fixing a broken leg is a big sum, but not compared to a lifetime of doctors visits, lab tests, prescriptions, etc. \n\nPrivate companies and charities will fill the void. If you contribute to that HSA along with a retirement account, that money will actually be there for you when you get old. \n\nThe House Budget Committe estimates that Medicare Part A will be insolvent in 2036 - So whether we dissolve it today, or wait 10 more years, it will dissappear. What then? I got my first job when I was 18. I'll pay taxes into Medicare and Medicaid for 50 years. When it is my turn to collect, that money will be gone. Same for you. Not only are you and I poorer today because of the taxes we've paid in, we're screwed in the future too. \n\nSource: https://budget.house.gov/press-release/social-security-and-medicare-continue-on-path-to-insolvency-trustees-confirm#:\\~:text=The%20Medicare%20Board%20of%20Trustees,projected%20in%20last%20year's%20report.",

People who receive both services are counted twice so you can't just add 21% and 19%  together.\n\nThe ideal number would be 0% uncovered. Just because some people are uncovered doesnt mean we dont care about them. And a lack of health insurance doesnt mean people are dying in the streets. There have always been free clinics today - provided by private hospitals and funded by charity. Thats good!\n\nThe issue you have with this proposal is that you think without government control the MAJOR cost will be passed on to the patient. But the high costs of treatment are because of a lack of transparency in medical billing - which is encouraged by government involvement and big insurance businesses using government leverage to keep prices high. More competitive practices and transparency will drive costs down.",

Probably close to $300. The government takes that money from me, and gives it to you - a retiree. In 30 years, when it's my turn to benefit from this system, it won't be there. It will have been gone for 20 years. What happens to the 140 million people who are stuck on this service when it dissolves?

Tax increases? Its $142 TRILLION in unfunded liabilities - thats an aweful lot of penny pinching, or an ungodly amount of taxes. \n\nEither way, you cant be serious to think the government has infinite money, has your best interest at heart, or is competent enough to make the necessary changes to avoid this collapse.",

It is completely reasonable to think millions of these people will be hurt or die bc of this. I'm sorry your policies will cause genocide levels of death. Maybe this is a sign you should think about it some more?\n\nDo you agree that private medicine is superior to public medicine?\u00a0\n\n\\-No.\n\nWhy would you not want that for everyone?\n\n\\-Bc I think it is much worse for society to have private insurance.

She was there before me. And after waiting for hours, with an appointment, the receptionist told her to leave. That's the type of system you're advocating. \n\nOn a separate trip, to a different doctor. At an urgent care, my girlfriend had a UTI and the provider offered her antibiotics.
