Cause of the goodness of their own heart?\u00a0\n\n\nBut the libs always say corporations are evil, so it can't be that. Why would evil corporations support your super good just righteous cause?\u00a0\n\n\nQuite a pickle. Clearly there's no real answer. It's a mystery. World may never know.\u00a0\n\n\nEdit-\n\n\nApparently it's not obvious, but I am being sarcastic\u00a0",

Established companies would rather be involved in the drafting of regulations that make it harder for the emerging companies to compete. All companies will do whatever is necessary to get on the good side of the current administration. None of them care about you and anything they support that benefits you is coincidental.",
