We vote to make them required in all cars. Yay safety! For round numbers, lets say the parts and tech hardware/software add $15k to the cost of the car. You pay that $15k. You can no longer choose to spend less and drive a less safe car, and drive more carefully. This is forced on you. \n\nOther example: alcohol is poison. It causes cancer, heart/brain issues, domestic violence, auto fatalities, and it is addictive as hell. Somehow you're trusted with the burden of treating this substance responsibly, but not cannabis, or a bunch of other drugs. \n\nThe government allows you to drink alcohol, and trusts you not to drink and drive (for now), but they dont allow you to buy a car with no seatbelts because they don't trust you to drive safely.",
