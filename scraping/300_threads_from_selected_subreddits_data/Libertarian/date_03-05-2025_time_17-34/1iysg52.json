For one thing, dogmatic religious instruction can be given. For another, the spirit of self-sacrifice that pervades a private institution has a good effect upon the inmates, and is contrasted with the cold and officialized administration of the public institutions. Connected with this, as also with the matter of economy, is the fact that boards of trustees and of lady managers and visitors give freely of their time and energy and sympathy in aid of private undertakings (343).\" \n\nIn every instance, volunteer community organizations pre-dated public bureaucratic institutions, and were providing services before requesting public funding. They also served as the basis of the social fabric of communities, religious and nonreligious (Rotarians, Meese, American Legion, etc) and contributed to building thickly networked communities that had intimate knowledge of their own communities unique capacities and needs. \n\nI see how the pre-existing voluntary social organizations were asking for funds from their local jurisdictions as early at the 1890's - but those institutions pre-dated the local jurisdictions and pre-dated the notion that providing for the general welfare was the job of the state. \n\nPeople have always been meeting their community needs through their social network and community organizations. A state or federal bureaucracy providing for general welfare is a relatively new thing.",

What pulled us out of the depression were those programs dwindling. Hoover started the Great Depression but FDR historically made it worse.",
