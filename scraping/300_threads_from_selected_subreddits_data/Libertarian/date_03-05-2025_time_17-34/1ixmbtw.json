    "selftext": "Hello. I've been libertarian for many years now. I love the concept of maximal individual freedom and non-aggression principle. If I understand correctly it relies on human free will. But more and more stuff I read, it seems like we're genetically (and epigenetically) preset bio-machines. Our sexual orientation, intelligence, political views, biasses - we have SOME impact on it, but generally we're basically born with it. Which makes me think - could humanity composed of so many different individuals achieve goals benefiting all of as?\n\n  \n1. Climat change. It seems to be consensus that climate change is antropogenic. With so many denialist  (and maybe just stupid people not able to comprehend its seriousness) how could we solve this problem in stateless society?  \n2. Some people are not very intelligent and/or not rational (doesn't have to be correlated). How libertarian society could solve problems caused by those people? For example higher crime rate caused by their poverty and inability to live on their own. I hate 'social justice' term (it's standing on its head), but it seems to beneficial for all to reduce some outcome inequalities.\n\n  \nProbably I'll come up with more questions later, but for now that's it. I hope for a constructive discussion. ",

Most libertarians don't believe that property rights extend indefinitely to the air above, ground below, or water connected and that you are responsible for how your activity on your property impacts neighboring property and by extension the world at large. \n\n2. All for non-governmental charity and assistance. \"Helping the poor\" is not in the domain of government in my view.",

People are just as affected by problems with irrationality, stupidity, greed, as people. \n\nUnless, through some magic, you think that people in government are somehow exempt from the forces, weaknesses, and predilections that plague all people everywhere.  \n\nBecause unless you believe in magic you have to ask yourself...  Putting a few thousand people in charge of a few million... Does that make the problem worse?  Or does it make it better?",
