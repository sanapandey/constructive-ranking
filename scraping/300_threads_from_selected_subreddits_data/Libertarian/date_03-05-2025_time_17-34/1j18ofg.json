It's the mirror-image of communism and both are arguably religious-like, pushing for 1) a complete restructuring of societal structures (radical in itself) and 2) a utopian future that has been tried at small scale and has never really functioned, but true believers will tell you that it's because a) it wasn't done properly or b) it failed because of evil external forces.",

I hate the two party system too, I'm with you there. It is beyond broken. It's just that Trump's/MAGA end game is to literally end democracy and install a tyrant to rule over us forever.
