    "selftext": "From [the Hill](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5145387-danielle-sassoon-resigns-letter/):\n\n>Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York,\u00a0[resigned from her post](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5143787-us-attorney-resigns-adams-case/)\u00a0after the Justice Department (DOJ) directed her to drop charges against New York City Mayor\u00a0[Eric Adams\u00a0](https://thehill.com/people/eric-adams/)(D).\u00a0\n\n>A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office confirmed Sassoon stepped down from her post Thursday afternoon.\u00a0\n\n>The\u00a0DOJ told Sassoon that the charges against Adams\u00a0[should be dropped](https://thehill.com/homenews/5137361-doj-charges-nyc-mayor-eric-adams/), arguing the case \u201cimproperly interfered\u201d with Adams\u2019s reelection campaign and restricted his ability to address illegal immigration and violent crime.\u00a0\n\nFrom the letter:\n\n>Rather than be rewarded, Adams's advocacy should be called out for what it is: an improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange for a dismissal of his case. Although Mr. Bove disclaimed any intention to exchange leniency in this case for Adams's assistance in enforcing federal law, that is the nature of the bargain laid bare in Mr. Bove's memo. That is especially so given Mr. Bove's comparison to the Bout prisoner exchange, which was quite expressly a *quid pro quo*, but one carried out by the White House, and not the prosecutors in charge of Bout's case. \n\n>  \n. . .   \n\n\n>In particular, the rationale given by Mr. Bove\u2014an exchange between a criminal defendant and the Department of Justice akin to the Bout exchange with Russia\u2014is, as explained above, a bargain that a prosecutor should not make. Moreover, dismissing without prejudice and with the express option of again indicting Adams in the future creates obvious ethical problems, by implicitly threatening future prosecution if Adams\u2019s cooperation with enforcing the immigration laws proves unsatisfactory to the Department. See In re Christoff, 690 N.E.2d 1135 (Ind. 1997) (disciplining prosecutor for threatening to renew a dormant criminal investigation against a potential candidate for public office in order to dissuade the candidate from running); Bruce A. Green & Rebecca Roiphe, Who Should Police Politicization of the DOJ?, 35 Notre Dame J.L. Ethics & Pub. Pol\u2019y 671, 681 (2021) (noting that the Arizona Supreme Court disbarred the elected chief prosecutor of Maricopa County, Arizona, and his deputy, in part, for misusing their power to advance the chief prosecutor\u2019s partisan political interests). Finally, given the highly generalized accusations of weaponization, weighed against the strength of the evidence against Adams, a court will likely question whether that basis is pretextual. See, e.g., United States v. Greater Blouse, Skirt & Neckwear Contractors, 228 F. Supp. 483, 487 (S.D.N.Y. 1964) (courts \u201cshould be satisfied that the reasons advanced for the proposed dismissal are substantial and the real grounds upon which the application is based\u201d)\n\n>\n\n",

Trying to use federal authority to outmuscle NY courts and interfere with legitimate corruption cases is bad for America and the liberty movement in America in particular. I think this is really, really scandalous.",
