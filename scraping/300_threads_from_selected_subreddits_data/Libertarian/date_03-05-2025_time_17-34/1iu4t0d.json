    "selftext": "The \"gay marijuana farmers can protect their property with an AR-15\" isn't how people vote. Personal rights are important, and we should fight for them, but economic rights will get way more votes and money.   \nThe core of our messaging in the United States should be \"We will make you rich!\" In reference to low taxes, easy entry to markets, slashing regulation and getting the government completely out of health care and abolishing the Fed, ending inflation crises.   \nIt also makes us sound more grounded, like we're not focusing too much on fringe cases where personal rights are violated, as everyone will benefit.   \nIt's easy to show that Johnson's Great Society elongated poverty and that citizens who produce are the only ones who can become successful.  \nIt's also a great time to do this because so many people in power are talking about the National Debt, it's actually in the spotlight for a while. So why not take advantage?   \nIf we started campaigning to business owners to make it easier to do business and individuals to increase their spending money, then we would be spreading a message that's easy to relate to.\n\nLibertarian party, the pro-business party, the pro-consumer party, the small government party, the rich party!",

There will be plenty of poor people, even in a complete and total laissez-faire market system.\n\nSecond, you imply it's The Party who will make you rich. The Party can remove the roadblocks, but it's the driver on the road who must get to their own destination. And just having no (government imposed) roadblocks isn't a guarantee to arriving at one's planned destination. \n\nThere is only one \"ultimate\" benefit to being Libertarian: we all agree to respect each others' right to Life and Property.",
