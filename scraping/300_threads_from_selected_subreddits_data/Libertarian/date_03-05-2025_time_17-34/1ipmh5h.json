Same thing. \n\n--------------------------\n\nAnd for the clueless...\n\nA Communist is somebody that wants communism. \n\nA Communist government is a government that uses socialism to try to achieve communism. \n\nAnd Communist governments have killed millions of people trying to achieve communism. \n\nThis is why the statement: \"Communism kills\" is a accurate one.",

Whether it be a communistic unity party or a \"democratic\" national central government. In western nations there is also a strong tendency to fewer and bigger levers for decision making. Capitalism also has this tendency for exploitation of resources and centralize them in the form of money on fewer and fewer people. In the very long term it will lead to collapse. When the masses suffer, they get angry and make more authoritarian and centralized regimes necessary to suppress revolt and uphold social order... A never ending cycle it seems...",

I think that's a problem. money itself is purely a means, it has no inherent value (hyperinflation makes that obvious). its value is derived from what you can do with it. once it becomes an end, which I interpret as a central feat of capitalism, it becomes problematic.\n\nI think there are two very good basic ideas in capitalism which make for its great success: 1) the free market and 2) being rewarded for creating a surplus value to society.\n\nI think the free market is quite an accurate resemblance of the unpredictability of raw nature. we humans have been subjected to natures will for millenia. but the modern market is so heavily manipulated by us humans, that everything becomes dependent on humans will. that's catastrophic long term. we are not god and the more we try to be, the more we will dig our own grave, I believe.\n\nalso the I think the idea that through work we provide a surplus value and are being rewarded for it, is good and natural. this is true for a barbaric tribe in raw nature (their work consists in caring for survival) as much as it is for modern civilization. culture, that thing which makes the difference between the natural state and civilization, is entirely based on work.\n\nbut today most people don't primarily work in order to provide a surplus value and most actors on the market are not subjected to the free market dynamics.",

They all acted the same, implemented the same sort of policies, had similar political ideas, and all resulted in the same ting. \n\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe confusion stems from the fact that Totalitarians hate each other and oppose each other vehemently.   How can two groups of people be on the same side of the political spectrum yet go out of their way to murder each other so viciously and in such great numbers? \n\nThe major clue that should tip people off is that once Totalitarians get into power the first thing they do is start oppressing and murdering **themselves**. \n\nThe first thing that Hitler did when he finally gained power was \"Night of Long knives\" were he murdered the leaders of other Nazi groups, imprisoned much of their followers, and dissolved all of their organizations. \n\nThe first thing the Soviets did after murdering the remnants of the old Imperial government in the Russian revolution was to immediately split the Russian Democratic Socialist Worker Party party into the Bolshevik and Menshevik factions, then proceeded to fight internally until the Mensheviks were purged and its leaders imprisoned, exiled, or killed. \n\nPolitical purges is a trait for totalitarianism. \n\nThis is made worse by the fact that totalitarianism doesn't actually work, yet itself is grounded in a sort of religion.  So that evidence of the regime not actually being functional... instead of forcing a rethink and change of direction.. is evidence of lack of purity in the movement. \n\nSo, yes, it is normal for Nazis and Communists and other regimes to all hate each other and murder each other.  This is what they do to themselves. \n\nThe nature of totalitarianism is that \"there can be only one\".",

I believe they're strictly related.\n\n\\[Sorry for any English mistakes, I'm not a native speaker\\]",
