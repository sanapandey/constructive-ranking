Most likely explanation is a massive error both his and of his political advisors that shouldn't have let this even reach the president.\n\nIf Milei wanted to commit fraud he has far more less risky and more profitable ways to do it, like the recent history of Argentina shows.\n\nAlso as a personal opinion we shouldn't be so focused on this and more focused on the bloodbath happening in the Province of Buenos Aires where one person is killed everyday due to the negligence of the governor.",

The thing is, we don\u2019t know that. We assume and project our most idyllic libertarian ideals onto him because deep down, every single one of us on here wants him to succeed. If he succeeds, then he\u2019ll be the case study for the rest of the world.\n\nBut Javier Milei is human like the rest of us. He\u2019s just as susceptible to corruption via power and money and greed. I don\u2019t want to assume that Milei operated under bad intentions, but I\u2019m all about speaking truth to power and holding those in power to a higher standard of accountability. And lately there are a lot of people pulling this crypto scam bs that tarnishes the reputation of honest blockchain technology. Furthermore, the misuse of funds is one of the biggest reasons why U.S. libertarians don\u2019t trust the government to have our best interests at heart. Milei is as susceptible as the rest of them, which is why it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we learned that Milei was 100% aware of what he was doing.\n\nedit: formatting",

Most of the population here never had crypto, and those who had, were the same people who already vote for him. If the economic news keep getting better this wont affect his image much, but i think the real damage is to his image of smart economist, and with reason.",
