    "selftext": "The COVID lockdowns in 2020, where young people stalled their lives and stayed home to protect the elderly and the immunocompromised, were not just mandatory, they were an opportunity for democrat and republican politicians to make a lot of money. \n\nIn the U.S., state governors ordered businesses to shut down. Depending on where you lived, you could not go to work, to school, the gym, or the library. Meanwhile, politicians like Nancy Pelosi made millions off of multiple investments of tens of thousands of dollars into Amazon and Doordash, which were coincidentally invested about a month and a half before the lockdown orders were given. \n\nAn entire generation of young people turned from socializing and learning at school to screens and tablets at home, all to protect the elderly. We had to fall behind on rent to help old people stay healthy, all while still being taxed to pay for their social security.\n\nI'm not arguing for or against social security, or disparaging the elderly, but the richest and most powerful generation in human history abandoned young people in the most authoritarian act in American living memory, and we've all stopped talking about it.",

In my final term I took a seminar about the themes of fear and security in American society. The professor had literally written the book on the social trends of increased fear-based isolation and risk aversion, and the negative effects of these on American communities and social life.\n\nThis really primed my response to COVID I think, and I looked up the professor herself a few months into it only to see that she was a total lockdown proponent arguing for the school to go fully virtual. This is one of the things that made me lose all respect for academia, that a historian who had made a career speaking and writing about the erosion of liberties under 'crisis' would be so unable to recognize (let alone fight) this very process happening in real time.",

I also completely disagree with your claim that we had sufficient data to make decisions in Feb & March 2020. No vaccine or effective confirmed treatment at that point. Remember when they weren't sure if it was spreading by air or droplets, and didn't know if it could live on surfaces, so they advised us to wipe down all our groceries and packages for the first couple months?\n\nRegardless, your overall point is laughably reductionist and there's a MASSIVE difference between:\n\n\"I'm a scientist and this disease (ike lots of diseases) looks really contagious and has been spreading quickly and easily between people, we don't know much about it and sure as hell don't have a treatment for it yet, so maybe let's just have folks hunker down for a bit to and see if we can minimize death and suffering as best we can and get the spread under control\", \n\nand\n\n\"I'm a government lackey and my boss said we're going to ship all the Jews off on a train somewhere and then gas them because they're not pure/white enough, so I'll just completely abandon my moral code I've had my whole life that says not to murder people, and just fall in line with the boss man and do my part to make that happen\".\n\nThat's a completely absurd claim to equate those 2 situations.",

What's your point? 3% inflation is higher than I would like... But I'm not allowed to complain about 10% during COVID because we are still around 3% in 2025? What kind of twisted logic is that?  \n\n>If you're not liquidating your dollars into hard bitcoin that's on you.\n\nBTC only stores wealth. Poor people don't hold assets and are f#cked by stagnant wages - which are always the last thing to rise in an inflationary cycle. Honestly a super bad take. The vast majority of Americans survive primarily off of wage income - not assset price appreciation.\n\n>you should've been staying home anyways\n\nDisagree. Prove to me lockdowns worked. You cannot. It was an economic cost to the economy with zero benefit. Furthermore, masking children and shutting down schools was objectively wrong. \n\n>COVID lock down ain't even in my top-20.\n\nSo I should just shut up and not say anything because your priority ranking is different from mine?",

            "body": "Hey hey hey!!! Let's not forget the $10S OF THOUSANDS INVESTED INTO Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax before the pandemic as well. The MAJOR push for the untested Vaccine that they said you'd only need 1 treatment of and you were 100% protected that, then turned into you needing just 1 more followup shot, then another and another until they finally said Oh, well you'll actually need to get 1 every year and it doesn't actually protect you from it and we NEEEVVEERRR said that if you get the first shot that you'd be protected from covid.. \n\nThey straight up gas lit the entire US on that vaccine.. they pushed news cycles to villainize the people that were questioning those things and asking why they kept changing their info on these things. \n\nDon't forget the investments into the N-95 Masks... \n\nThat too had a massive amount of misinformation attached to those. They made people believe that by wearing one protected THEMSELVES from viruses instead of believing that it only reduced the possibility of the WEARER from spreading anything they themselves might have... people were ferociously attacked over these things..ferociously attacked over things that they themselves had 0 understanding on amd that refused to educate themselves on.. \n\n(I AM NOT anti vaxx, i AM NOT, anti mask. Im only pointing out the terrible things that were purpotrated on my fellow Americans.)  \n\nI've had several family members who had never had covid, at least they didn't have covid until they got the vaccine.. and they got ALL the shots (like 10 or so?) Ended up with covid, not once but like 4-5 times and are still getting covid. They all have now developed long term/lasting side effects because of the shot. My uncle who was battling cancer at the time, he got the shot and so did my aunt (his wife) because they wanted to protect themselves from covid and from possibly wiping him out...they immediately got covid after the shot. Didn't have any covid or issues leading up to the shot. Only after they got the shot and each time they got the new ones or I guess you could call the several after the first one, boosters??\n\nMy point is, they made MILLIONS off of those things too... MILLIONS off of the shots, MILLIONS off of the masks...MILLIONS off of the monetary incentives they gave hospitals to report majority of the deaths in the hospitals as covid related, which in turn construed the true mortality rate of covid and how bad it actually was... \n\nThey planned it and they absolutely got our freedoms from us so fuckin fast that our heads spun and our heads are only just now beginning to slow down from it...\n\nEdit to add:\n\nThey made people turn on the ones that were questioning this one vaccine, they villainized people horrendously to silence anyone else who would dare to publicly question it. That alone should've had people asking more questions... like why are they wanting to silence people THIS badly? They only interviewed or reported on the absolute dumbasses that were against every vaccine. They never reported on and interviewed the actual regular people that were only questioning THIS ONE PARTICULAR VACCINE.... I guarantee you that majority of the people weren't the full on anti vax of every vaccine like the media made it seem.  The media made it to where if you even questioned the government and they pharmaceutical companies that you're just an absolute evil POS monster and how dare you think that the government would EVER want to do anything wrong towards you.. you're wrong to believe the cycles that history has taught us about governments l, especially the ones with too much power!!",
