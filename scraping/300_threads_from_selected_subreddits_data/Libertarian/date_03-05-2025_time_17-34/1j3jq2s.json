The very nature of global conflict is putty in his hands on a stage of the most complex choreography.\n\nAll that said, my suspicions about him being a sabbatean messiah no longer seem like far-fetched ravings.  What is less clear is what is the real plan now that they are exposing themselves as the masters of reality they have evolved to be.  Will we be saved or will we be consumed in sacrificial pyres?\n\nI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just a tired old man but seeing this all unfold really makes me question everything.\nAnd what the hell Musk was on\u2026\n\nThe numbers have become meaningless, the curtain is coming down on a breathtakingly terrifying performance and we are now living in a new age\u2026 for better AND worse.",
