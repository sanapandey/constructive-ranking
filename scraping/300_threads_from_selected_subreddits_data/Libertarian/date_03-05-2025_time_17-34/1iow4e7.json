There is no accountability and kids are passed to the next grade and beyond without learning the material. Academics have been replaced by nonsensical crap.",

A strong country should be able to provide some support to people with potential. \n\nSome funding was used for Special Education needs, which go beyond just teachers. I know two teachers who work in Special Education settings and each student has a handler. Some students are extremely disruptive in class. And at times this support requires more than teachers, like speech therapists, OT, etc. The reality is that schools at a local level cannot support these programs, so that\u2019s where the Dept Education comes in. And keeping these programs funded is VERY expensive. The reality is that there is a lot of investment here for little return (hate to say it, but most will not be productive members of society). My friends who are teachers to these students come home frustrated and exhausted. There are layers and layers of paperwork they have to do to measure progress but I know it\u2019s futile. We need funds to be invested into students with potential, and if a student is motivated but behind, I support providing resources to support them. I\u2019m ok with my tax dollars going to that. I have a business and I want my workers to be educated. It\u2019s hard working with undereducated employees.",

Government subsidies have allowed colleges to raise tuition far above market value, since most students recieve some form of financial aid. It's simple: people are willing to pay the same price for education they always were, and when part of tuition is covered by financial aid for alot of students you can raise tuition so that the gap between the financial aid coverage and the tuition is the same as it was without subsidization. \n\nThis dumping of money inflates the price of tuition unfairly to the point upper middle class students who are ineligible for aid can no longer afford college. Just look at tuition rates prior to government subsidies. It's a clear trend with a high correlation.",
