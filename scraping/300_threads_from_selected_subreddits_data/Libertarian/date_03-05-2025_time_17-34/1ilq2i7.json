I think there\u2019s a valid argument for it to be necessary government intervention, as the private sector really has no incentive to protect land for public use. Sure, charities fueled by notations can do some of the same things, but it comes to a point where an organization can make more money from something like a big oil company buying drilling rights than from donations.\n\nThoughts?",

In it's current state, the National Parks Service is actually self-sustaining with the very low fees it collects for use. It would actually be profitable except the government redirects the money to other departments. On top of that, they actually do a damn good job.\n\nThere are a million other ways I would cut into government before I got to this.",

The Bill of Rights declared that people had God given Rights (i.e, inherent rights that a higher authority than any government could achieve.) The colonies decided they would rather risk dying to defend those rights than live without them. The colonies did not have an overwhelming majority. The colonies did not have a well trained army. The colonies did not have outside support (until later in the war,) yet they decided to fight anyway. In reality, it was the distance between the the New World and England that led to Victory in the revolutionary war. That, and a complete shake-up in military tactics that the British weren't used to fighting (the colonists weren't standing in lines waiting to be shot by a lead wall). \n\nThe opposing viewpoints of libertarianism are tyranny. Tyranny does not fit into the social or economic model of libertarianism. A libertarian society does not form under the threat of violence. A libertarian society does not form from overwhelming force. A libertarian society forms when the people unite against the government in the desire to exist freely without extortion, excessive regulation, and surveillance. We don't want to take the government by force, we just want the government to leave us alone. We want to collect rainwater without being fined. We want to make things and sell them without buisiness licenses. We want to live knowing there's no extensive database of information about us sitting on a server in a dark room in an NSA building (see the Patriot Act for more info).

Personally I don't think national parks should exist. While maintaining wildlife is absolutely vital to us, I think that people owning large pieces of land with wildlife on them should be the norm rather than the exception so that people can protect them far better than park services ever could. Some people of course won't, people that have a yard full of trash are an example to prove some people just don't care about their land. I think the vast majority would though. Most people aren't going to want to sell drilling rights for their personal land to become polluted and wreck their crops and drinking supply, though some desperate people (and stupid people) certainly would.",

That's a difference and esp the last one has no guaranteed outcome that can be equaled with 'private property right'.\n\nNA wasn't unoccupied.  The Natives lived on it.  If you go by your logic it was theirs.  They 'worked it' as nomads (only took what it offered) or settled (plenty cities with populations that where farming) and all of them clashed with each other over those very resources from time to time.\n\nThis means, any 'private property' anywhere ultimately is based on a group existing there (or walking in) enforcing its right to that property by violence against anyone that thinks otherwise (esp if those had been existing there before).\n\nThis also means your private property is the product of that land taking with force and you alone would not be able to 1) do this all on your own and 2) unable to defend your land if the reverse where to happen to you.\n\nFor example the Jewish settlers in WB.. they settle on land that people already own who live there, but who can't enforce that 'right'. So either the international law is wrong and the Israelis have the right or the international law is correct and the Israelis don't have the right, but have the force to do so.",

Anyone stating they would definitely do it perfectly without incident is being unreasonable because that's impossible to predict. That's an unreasonable goalpost though. Much of nature is harmed under state care.  \n  \nOnly taking what is offered is different than inputting labor and resources to make what is there better and protect it. I agree with you at least on the part about violence being used to take over these areas being against our values. That is not consistently the case for how land was obtained during this period though. Contracts that the people were here before agreed to with settlers might have been unjust because they didn't understand the terms very well, but that's different than violence. Contracts and violence are both things we would have to deal with in this scenario, and it's the responsibility of the land owner to do that well or they risk their property being taken, even if it's unjust for it to be.\n\nNobody says I have to do it \"all on my own\". I can hire people, I can have a family and community to help if we choose to mutually agree on terms. Not enlisting the state doesn't equal \"all alone\". Lack of state doesn't equal lack of community.\n\nWhat is going on right now there is horrible and I really feel for those people. There is nothing just about it. It's a good example of how military hasn't really helped protect them though. They may not have the same strength as the military here or some other places, but they have a military and state none the less, as well as allies, even if not many.",
