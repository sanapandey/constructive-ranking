I like his videos. Thought I would share.\n\nI read Ayn Rand years ago and thought she was awful.  However, i found this viewpoint interesting.  Here's what made me begin to think a bit more about it...\n\nWhen I was in Florence, I noticed that much of the Renaissance Art depicted saints or those who made contrition as poor and decrepit. (Mary Magdalena statues, for example... she looks so much better as a sinner lol). The sinners were pretty much gorgeous,  fat and happy! Was this church propaganda to make folks think that being poor made you closer to god?\n\nSo I started to wonder if we have been fed a similar narrative \ud83e\udd14.  Now I believe in service to others, but I also believe you have to \"put your oxygen mask on first\" in order to help others. \n\nGoing to read Rand again and see how I hold her views at this stage un my life.",
