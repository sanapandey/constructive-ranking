First off, yeah- the U.S. spends too much money on foreign aid, but acting like this is some unique Trump/Musk betrayal is kinda weird. Every president, Republican and Democrat, has sent money to Israel. If anything, Trump actually cut more foreign aid than most of his predecessors. So if we\u2019re gonna be mad about wasteful spending (which we should be), we should at least spread the blame around fairly instead of acting like this is some personal passion project of his.\n\nAnd on the idea that \u201cTrump has no control over spending\u201d, yeah, Congress controls the purse, but let\u2019s not pretend presidents don\u2019t have influence. If they didn\u2019t, then why would we argue about their economic records? Every president from Reagan to Biden gets judged on spending, so we can\u2019t suddenly say it\u2019s all Congress' fault when it\u2019s inconvenient. Trump\u2019s policies: like them or not - did cut regulatory costs in her first term, shift federal spending priorities, and push for budget reforms. You can argue about how effective he was, but saying he has zero control is just not true. What he's doing now is much in the same vein, only bolder- and quite literally what MANY of us have been pleading for, for years.\n\nAs far as Elon: saying he was just \u201crandomly given power\u201d is like saying Michael Jordan was randomly given NBA championships. Musk became influential because he outcompeted everyone else, not solely because the government \"gave\" him control. We should always be wary of crony capitalism, but Musk\u2019s whole deal has been disrupting bloated industries (like government-controlled space travel and overregulated auto manufacturing). If anything, that\u2019s a net win for free markets.\n\n>there are rules and checks and balances that Trump and Elon have stepped around entirely\n\nCome on man. If that were true, Trump wouldn\u2019t be fighting off 47 lawsuits and half of Washington trying to stop him.\n\nThe system is definitely still working; it\u2019s just that a lot of people don\u2019t like that MAGA is playing the game better than they expected. The reality of this predicament however, is that the checks and balances have been corrupted to provide a shield for the bureaucracy. The corruption has essentially built an immune system in order to self perpetuate. There's no way you don't see that. I refuse to believe you're that naive.\n\nAt the end of the day, you don\u2019t have to like Trump or Musk, but let\u2019s at least be precise with our criticisms. There\u2019s a difference between calling out legitimate issues and just regurgitating the same tired \u201corange man bad\u201d talking points. If we\u2019re going to be skeptical of power (which we absolutely should be), let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re aiming at the right targets.\n\nBTW: I don't care about downvotes. We can swap downvotes all day if you like. I have plenty to spend. It's the ideas that matter. You want to truly \"downvote\" me, make a cogent counterpoint.",
