You cannot \u201cinter\u201d a citizen. You \u201cinter\u201d an alien and you \u201cincarcerate\u201d a citizen. Any camp that contains detained citizens is an incarceration camp and calling it an internment camp whitewashes the unconstitutionality of removing a citizen\u2019s right to due process (e.g. The US did not have \u201cJapanese Internment\u201d camps, they had \u201cJapanese Incarceration\u201d camps since all camps included American citizens who were deprived of their constitutional rights). Additionally, a concentration camp is any internment/incarceration camp that concentrates members of a certain subgroup (political prisoners, refugees, ethnic minorities) under armed guard. \n\nSo, again, \u201cwho supports concentration camps?\u201d\n\nIn world war 1, The USA had German concentration camps. German citizens and American citizens of German descent were forced into a handful of camps across United States. \n\nIn world war 2, The USA had Japanese concentration camps. 2/3 of the people sent to these camps were American citizens. This idea was quite popular at the time given that it followed Pearl Harbor. The American government in their own contemporary documents admit that they didn\u2019t find or stop a single spy with this incredibly unconstitutional practice. Depending on your age, your parents or grandparents could have voted for the politicians that implemented the War Relocation Authority that implemented these concentration camps, and even if they didn\u2019t, they most likely supported these concentration camps that had broad public support. \n\nMore recently, Obama began the practice of family border detention, creating modern incarceration camps, Trump continued and ramped up this practice, Biden did not discontinue, but did lessen it, and finally Trump has again ramped up this practice again and is turning Guantanamo bay into a concentration camp. So people you know TODAY voted for a government that supports concentration camps.",

If yes, then that\u2019s a prison. \n\nIf he\u2019s detaining them without due process, under armed guard, in a facility with poor conditions that is not equipped to handle the number of prisoners interred/incarcerated, then it\u2019s a concentration camp. Their previous criminality is irrelevant.\n\nEdit: and in this article, advocacy groups who\u2019ve represented previous inmates at Guantanamo said that this decision should be \u201chorrifying us all\u201d. The president of Cuba called it \u201can act of brutality\u201d. Honestly, treating illegal migrants as though they\u2019re terrorists should be concerning even if they have a criminal history. Trump is casting a minority class as a political enemy and reinforcing that perception via a concentration camp. Anyone concerned with Libertarian values should be very much opposed to this.",
