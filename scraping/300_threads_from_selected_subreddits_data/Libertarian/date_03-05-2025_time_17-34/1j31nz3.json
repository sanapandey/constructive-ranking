    "selftext": "All of the cuts from DOGE won't mean jack shit if we don't see massive tax cuts, right? I mean, clearing excess spending is nice and all, and adds to national security in a sense because now the country can start paying off its debt... \n\n...but if all these cuts to services and fraud and waste don't lead to some recuperation of resources on our end, it means effectively nothing, right?\n\nI've been on the hook for student loans for fourteen years and I'm down to 25k, and having my taxes go down (fat chance) could potentially save me from misery. \n\nAnd if we got a lump sum \"return\" of cash due to tax cuts, would that not cause massive inflation?\n\nI'm skeptical as fuck. While I agree with the idea of cutting expenses, I'm really uncertain we'll see any benefit.",

Because of this, people who should be moving into positions of power or influence aren't and all the wealth that's accumulating at the top is doing so because nobody else is being given the opportunity to take the reigns until it's too late.\n\nSome people are also choosing professions that don't allow for the kind of upward mobility that's necessary to go from lower class to the upper class in society. We as a society have turned to education too much as a way of delineating this pathway up to the point it no longer functions that way.\n\nWe really need a way to incentivize C-suite workers for S&P 500 companies, possibly even all the way down to the Russell 3000, to retire by 65 and if they need work to occupy them, they take on executive roles for non-profits with a reduced salary. Other clear career paths with defined term lengths and responsibilities outlined within them would likely also help as long as everyone being moved up was competent, everyone getting passed over for certain promotions eventually reached some other valuable position that can afford a living wage, and the very bottom is left for people in transitional stages of life (entering the workforce, relocating, or end of life but still needing a purpose)",

I think President Trump has recommended 20% returned to tax payers, 20% to directly to the debt, and the other 60% would cut the deficit. Whether this would be enough - I don't know. Plus, paying down the debt while you tack on more to the debt is counter productive - he probably should just give us 25% and get the budget to balance (or as close as possible) with the rest.",
