Libertarians at the root are for personal liberty bound by the NAP. \n\nSince Trump\u2019s elections there are a number of MAGA that think \u201cdon\u2019t tread on me\u201d is cool and that makes them a libertarian. However, they are completely fine treading on people\u2019s personal decisions such as who they can marry and what they can wear, which goes counter to libertarianism.",
