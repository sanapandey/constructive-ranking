($7T- 5.2T)\n\nTrump tax cuts by the lowest est will add annother $500 Billion a year to that.(2.3 Trillion)\n\nThe Federal Reserve/Treasury sells bonds, bills, notes to finance the debt and sets the discounts and interest rates. Thats where the payments go, to the investors. If Inflation is higher than interest for bonds you would get less money back . You raise interest rates to compensate or discount the bonds (pay $400 for $500 worth of debt) The value of bonds is they are backed by the govt (guarenteed).\n\n If no one is going to make money on these then we lose the ability to borrow. Also about 23% of our debt is owned by other countries. Tariffs and them getting off the dollar for currency exchanges puts them buying our debt at risk and complicates trade.",

Presumably, the knowledge of officials that you no longer have the ability to place excess state assets into US government securities would remove the incentive to rob the local population more than if there was such an opportunity.\n\nIf you look closely at the structure of US pub. debt, you can see that individuals and private companies own no more than 10-13% of it. (This, by the way, is roughly equal to the usual number of mentally ill people in the general population.) All the rest is the claims of state and semi-state institutions. \n\nI think it would be right not to pay back the debt to government and semi-public creditors. These sums cannot harm the population any more than they already have in the process of taxation.",
