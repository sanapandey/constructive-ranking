The CFPB regulates financial markets to protect consumers from fraud and abuse by mega corporations. Did we forget the 08 crash was caused by an unregulated financial market?\n\nFrom its creation until 2017, the CFPB \"has curtailed abusive debt collection practices, reformed mortgage lending, publicized and investigated hundreds of thousands of complaints from aggrieved customers of financial institutions, and extracted nearly $19 billion for 29 million consumers in refunds and canceled debts. Given the CFPB has an annual budget of $600M, seems like it's paying for itself and is worth it's salt. It'd 0.01% of the federal budget. You really think it's worth getting rid of just because it was proposed by Warren? What's your rationale for that?\n\nI'm all for free market solutions but you need regulations especially in financial markets to protect against fraud and abuse.",
