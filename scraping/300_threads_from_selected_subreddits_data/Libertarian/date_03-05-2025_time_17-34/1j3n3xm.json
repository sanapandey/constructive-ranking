At the IAF, we support community-led solutions to creating economic opportunity and social inclusion for underserved populations in Bolivia, including women, youth, and indigenous people, who are more likely to take on stigmatized work like recycling. Fundaci\u00f3n Amigos de la Responsabilidad Social Empresarial (AMIGARSE) will work with approximately 40 recycler associations in five departments (Chuquisaca, La Paz, Santa Cruz, Sucre and Santa Cruz) to strengthen links among the recycler associations and advocate for public policies and programs that recognize and support an inclusive, community-based recycling sector. It will also work with the Red de Recolectores Santa Cruz to test the first phase of a community-based recycling enterprise model, transforming recycling associations into economic and social enterprises that provide environmental and solid waste management services to the public and private sector.",

I need custom orthotics and can\u2019t really walk much without them, the VA in puget sound was unable to find me a primary care doctor at American lake and Seattle was to far to drive so I now have community care. I need new orthotics now and have for several years, my referral for VA facilities is always denied because they\u2019re \u201cfull\u201d and I have a community foot dr. I had to pay 350$ for a deposit on some orthotics, I now hear the VA will not refund me or even partially help me because I should have used a VA facility. How can I use a VA facility if I can\u2019t get to one but have to pay out of pocket for community care but not have the VA pay me something back.",
