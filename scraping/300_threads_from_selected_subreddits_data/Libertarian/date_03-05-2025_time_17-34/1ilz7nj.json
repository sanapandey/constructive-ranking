Congress doesn\u2019t decide what happens with my tax dollars anymore. The President cannot be held accountable for official actions and had removed anyone in the FBI that has investigated him. Inspector generals were fired without notice. I could go on but honestly I\u2019m very surprised at how many Liberty minded people are okay with the blurring of corporate interests and the government. This is literally the State consolidating further. A tech and communications mogul given authority over congress by an executive that ignores the courts? Courts that preemptively excused him from official actions? No one saying \u201cuhoh\u201d from the side of liberty?",
