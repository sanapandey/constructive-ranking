            "body": "There is a creeping authoritarianism that is doing its best to destroy free speech.  People hate Nazis so if you can associate Nazis with free speech then they will hate that through association.  They have done it with free market capitalism, they have done it with conservatives, and now they want to do it with free speech. \n\nAuthoritarianism is easy to spot if you get your head pulled out off the ass-end of 'left vs right' politics that they try to use to blind you. \n\nI posted the following elsewhere and this is a repeat, but it is still relevant. \n\n---------------------------------\n\nThis idea of \"intolerant against intolerance\" began being heavily promoted among USA academics in the 1960s. One of the leading proponents of this viewpoint was Marcuse, who was the leading Critical Theorist of the time.\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/critical-theory\n\nhere is his 1965 paper \"Repressive Tolerance\".\n\nhttps://www.marcuse.org/herbert/publications/1960s/1965-repressive-tolerance-fulltext.html\n\nThe idea here is that tolerance, as promoted by Western Liberal Capitalist Society, is a tool for oppression.\n\nFor example when Blackshated the oppression and discrimination the white-lead Capitalist response was to listen to them and give them equal rights and protections under the then-new civil rights laws. Thus, by being tolerant to blacks, USA society suppressed the natural revolutionary fervor of Black people.\n\nNow that blacks had equal rights it made it easier to claim that the status quo (most blacks being poor) was natural and the result of their own choices and behaviors. It is 'their fault' they are poor now. Meaning that by giving them equal rights and protections they were fooled. Instead of burning down the country and creating a Marxist-socialist revolution they just went back home and now are more likely to just accept society as it is.\n\nMind you I don't believe this... I am just trying to summarize Marcuse's position.\n\nThus this style of tolerance is a weapon against liberation.\n\nInstead what is needed is to be intolerant towards intolerance. We must be intolerant against anything that helps maintain or protects or apologies for Capitalist society.\n\nBecause in Critical Theory... They no longer felt that Communism was inevitable. Instead there was two possible end-states... Communism or Facism. it is a binary choice. You get one or the other. There is no alternatives, no other possible end state. Thus anything that was not pro-Communism was, by definition, pro-Fascism whether or not people involved realized it.\n\nAnd because Fascism was a clear and present danger (it already happened once). Then any sort of action is entirely justified. Thus it becomes a moral imperative to suppress, silence, abuse, or otherwise eliminate anybody that is interested in defending Capitalist Society, which was inevitably going to lead to a total Fascist state.\n\nFrom the article:\n\n> Liberating tolerance, then, would mean intolerance against movements from the Right and toleration of movements from the Left. As to the scope of this tolerance and intolerance: ... it would extend to the stage of action as well as of discussion and propaganda, of deed as well as of word. The traditional criterion of clear and present danger seems no longer adequate to a stage where the whole society is in the situation of the theater audience when somebody cries: 'fire'. It is a situation in which the total catastrophe could be triggered off any moment, not only by a technical error, but also by a rational miscalculation of risks, or by a rash speech of one of the leaders. In past and different circumstances, the speeches of the Fascist and Nazi leaders were the immediate prologue to the massacre. The distance between the propaganda and the action, between the organization and its release on the people had become too short. But the spreading of the word could have been stopped before it was too late: if democratic tolerance had been withdrawn when the future leaders started their campaign, mankind would have had a chance of avoiding Auschwitz and a World War.\n\nHis students and people who read his books and idolized him in the 1960s are the people in charge of a lot of things now. Especially in social sciences and teaching schools.",
