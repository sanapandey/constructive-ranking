What we need is a cultural revolution based on libertarianism where more people demand transparency and accountability from the state.\n\nI'm as \"hardcore\" as the libertarians come in that I believe the state only exists to protect your property rights against violence, and that the private sector (e.g., people like Erik Prince) can do even that if you try hard enough.

Minarchy is a form of government. And a lab created virus released by the ccp that potentially targets the elderly so they aren't a drain on resources seems like it falls under the purview of the government to try and fight back.",
