This was bound to happen. If US tomorrow includes Taiwan in NATO China too will invade. That is just how international politics work. Now it would have been good if Ukraine was able to push Russia back but after 3 years Ukraine is short of men and is in danger of complete capitulation if US aid is pulled back or more men are not brought in from outside. Zelensky has had his fun and its time for some awakening before there is no Ukraine left. Yesterday he behaved like an entitled child who thinks he can spend all his father's money as he wishes.   \nUs should stop all aid to Ukraine, Israel or any other country and stop being a global police. It hasn't worked in last 35 years and no one wants US boots on the ground or taxpayer money for a foreign war anymore.",

To top it all off, the second and third biggest recipients of US aid, Egypt and Jordan, receive military aid in return for their friendly relations with Israel. So the US gives more money to Israel than any country in the world, and then bribes other countries to be friends with Israel on top of that.\n\nThey also attacked [the USS Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident), killing dozens of American servicemen.
