They shape laws. They write the rules.

Have people donate to this fund and somehow be able to distinguish lobby money between the thousands of possible core issue areas, many of which are in direct conflict with one another?  And do it more efficiently than the interest groups already doing it?  Or do you think that lobbying is only done by profit corporation?  What's you back end?  Politicians just have debit cards, or what?\n\nYou know that lobying isn't just about gathering money, right?  Somebody has to actually go deal with the politicians... you know, LOBBY them.\n\nThis is why I think your thing here is unserious and no more than half-considered.  You don't seem to know what lobbying actually is but you propose to have a better idea for it.",

Users\u00a0**choose specific lobbying campaigns**\u00a0to support, like crowdfunding for policy influence instead of elections. If a campaign gets enough backing, funds are used to hire a\u00a0**registered lobbyist**\u00a0who already works in that space.\n\n2. \u00a0**Who Does the Lobbying:**\u00a0You\u2019re absolutely right that lobbying isn\u2019t just about money\u2014it\u2019s about\u00a0**access and influence**. That\u2019s why this isn\u2019t just \u201cpeople donate and hope.\u201d The platform would connect\u00a0**real, professional lobbyists** with public backed campaigns, just like corporate and trade groups do, but for regular people.\n\n3. \u00a0**Why This Is Different:**\u00a0Interest groups already do this, but they only represent\u00a0**narrow causes and big donors**. The goal here is to create\u00a0**an open platform where issues compete for public support, not just billionaire funding.**\n\nI get the skepticism, and I\u2019m not saying this is a flawless concept.  But the alternative is letting corporate lobbyists continue running the game while we wait for some ideal government reform that may never come. If you think there\u2019s a better way to balance the scales, I\u2019d actually love to hear it.\"\n\nEnjoy the beer.",

The issue orgs already do this; in fact lobbyists are generally employed by them.\n\nWhy should I give your platform money when I can sign up with a nonprofit issues-based organization who has lobbyists on staff, knows the pertinent laws, does training, and has other membership benefits.  AND, by the way, who are accountable to their members for when things don't get done.\n\nInsofar as I care to have lobbying exist at all, I'd rather my dollar go to someone who is focused on and understands my core issue, not to some clearinghouse for \"freelance lobbyists\" looking to pick up some cash.",

That\u2019s exactly why we\u2019re testing the idea of a people-powered lobbying platform\u2014to see if collective funding can counterbalance corporate influence. Our implied solution is to encourage people to not donate to political parties and campaigns, but to team up with each other and push for the change we would like to see. Do you think there\u2019s another way to level the playing field?",

If companies were given a cap on how much they could spend on lobbying, this would even the playing field for companies with more and less capital. \n\nLastly I think quid pro quo, or bribes, should be made illegal in lobbying. It\u2019s technically already illegal, but it\u2019s hardly enforceable when lobbyists and congressman can meet for dinner outside of work. Lobbying needs to occur under the oversight of the Office of the Inspector General. If we had a referee from the OIG in the room when lobbying was taking place, I think there would be overnight change. But I doubt it will ever happen",
