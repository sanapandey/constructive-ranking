What the US promised in the 90s was to not expand NATO to the East.\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, we're still in a free country. Nobody is stopping you from sending your own personal wealth to Ukraine. Nobody is stopping you from volunteering to fight. Not sure why you're a coward when it comes to your own pocket and ass, but want to drag other Americans into it.",

The actual text reads:\n\n\n>...The United States of America reaffirm their commitment to seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine, as a non-nuclear-weapon state party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, if Ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used.\n\n\nThat's the extent... Taking the matter to the UNSC. Quite a difference from the nonsense you're peddling.\n\n\nOnce again, you're not answering why you're not on the front lines. You're a coward advocating for others to fight a battle you're not willing to engage in.",

This mindset sets them apart in several key ways:\n\nLibertarians operate from first principles (e.g., individual liberty, voluntary exchange, non-aggression) rather than partisan loyalty or ideological conformity.\n\nUnlike conservatives, who may dismiss uncomfortable truths about government policies they favor (like military spending, and an over militerized police force), and liberals, who often resist data contradicting their preferred welfare programs, libertarians are skeptical of all authority and willing to reevaluate positions when evidence demands it but in a scientific manor.\n\n\nWhether it\u2019s researching the unintended consequences of drug prohibition, the inefficiencies of government-run healthcare, or even issues like climate change or police reform, libertarians prioritize data over dogma.\n\nThis means reading primary sources, diving into economic studies, and exploring historical contexts, rather than regurgitating talking points.\n\nFor example, libertarians critically examined the COVID-19 lockdowns using real-world data on their economic and social costs, rather than blindly supporting or opposing them based on party affiliation.\n\n\nWhile conservatives and liberals often rely on echo chambers, libertarians thrive on debate and self-correction.\n\nMany prominent libertarians, from Milton Friedman to F.A. Hayek, have adjusted their views when confronted with new evidence, something that is rare among mainstream political movements.\n\nThe emphasis is on voluntary persuasion, not coercion, which extends to the way libertarians approach intellectual discourse.\n\nLibertarians recognize that truth is often complex and uncomfortable.\n\nWhile conservatives may reflexively support police without examining corruption or abuse, and liberals may demand more taxation without considering its distortions, libertarians ask deeper questions about the role of incentives, unintended consequences, and the effectiveness of government intervention.\n\nEven when the research challenges libertarian assumptions (e.g., the benefits of some regulations in specific cases), they engage with the findings rather than dismiss them outright.\n\nLibertarians don\u2019t just say \u201cgovernment is bad\u201d and leave it at that; they analyze why government interventions fail and present alternatives backed by research.\n\nFrom Austrian economics to public choice theory, libertarians bring a multidisciplinary approach to evaluating policies.\n\nWhether it\u2019s analyzing the impact of central banking, the failure of the war on drugs, or the economic distortions of corporate subsidies, libertarians rely on hard data and theory rather than emotional appeals.\n\nLibertarians differ from cuckservatives and libtards because they don\u2019t settle for easy answers. They dig into the facts, even when those facts are inconvenient or force them to refine their views. Whether it\u2019s challenging the morality of war, the effectiveness of welfare, or the necessity of government regulations, libertarians hold themselves to a higher standard of research and debate, ensuring that their positions are based on reason, evidence, and principle\u2014not just political tribalism.",

Obligation to Act (English vs. Russian)\n\nThe English version states that signatories will \"seek immediate United Nations Security Council action\" in response to threats against Ukraine. This implies a diplomatic, rather than military, response.\n\nThe Russian version suggests a more active obligation, reinforcing Ukraine\u2019s belief that stronger security commitments were in place.\n\nThe Ukrainian interpretation leaned toward the Russian version, leading to unrealistic expectations of direct military assistance in case of aggression.\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution (Article II, Section 2), a treaty requires approval by two-thirds of the Senate. No such treaty was ever made\u2014the memorandum is a political agreement, not a legally binding document.\n\nSome cherry-pick the English version to fit their arguments while ignoring the broader linguistic and legal context. The reality is that both Russia and Ukraine misunderstood the memorandum's nature, wrongly assuming it carried enforceable security guarantees. In truth, it was a diplomatic maneuver by the United States, never intended to create a NATO-style defense obligation.\n\nUnderstanding the nuances of the document in all languages is essential before drawing conclusions. Simply citing the English version while ignoring the Russian and Ukrainian texts leads to misinterpretation or deliberate misrepresentation of the facts.\n\nhttps://treaties.un.org/Pages/showDetails.aspx?objid=0800000280401fbb\nUnder Text Document(s)\nThat's a primary source, see how it is NOT transcripted",
