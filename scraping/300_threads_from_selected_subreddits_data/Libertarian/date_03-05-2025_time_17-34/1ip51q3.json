            "body": "The framing of this topic is suspect for several reasons: \n\nFirst, USAID is one of [several donors to OCCRP](https://www.occrp.org/en/about-us/who-supports-our-work), including the State Department and several 501c3 orgs. The focus on USAID seems to capitalize on the recent maligning of the agency to add credence to the claim.\n\nSecond, Shellenberg's characterization that the CIA \"[involved in the impeachment of President](https://www.newsmax.com/amp/newsfront/michael-shellenberger-usaid-fund/2025/02/06/id/1198050/)\" is a bit hyperbolic. The initial whistleblower complaint was made by a CIA analyst, but there is nothing indicating that the CIA as an organization was involved in either the OCCRP report or otherwise acting in a coordinated manner with other entities in either the complaint or impeachment inquiry. \n\nThird, as for the [whistleblower complaint](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/read-the-whistleblower-complaint-regarding-president-trump-s-communications-with-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelensky/4b9e0ca5-3824-467f-b1a3-77f2d4ee16aa/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_4). Yes, the July 22, 2019 report from OCCRP was mentioned four (4) times . . . in footnotes. In each instance the reference to the July 22 report was to support other information obtained by the whistleblower. For instance, in the complaint the whistleblower states, \"\\[s\\]eparately, multiple U.S. officials told me that Mr. Giuliani had reportedly privately reached out to a variety of other Zelenskyy advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov.\" There is a citation to a footnote that reads, in whole, \"\\[i\\[n a report published by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) on 22 July, two associates of Mr. Giuliani reportedly traveled to Kyiv in May 201Q and met with Mr. Bakanov and another close Zelenskyy adviser, Mr. Serhiy Shefir.\" \n\nLikewise, the whistleblower further states, \"\\[a\\]round the same time, I also learned from a U.S. official that \"associates\" of Mr. Giuliani were trying to make contact with the incoming Zelenskyy team.\" As for the OCCRP July 22 report reference, the footnote states, in whole, \"I do not know whether these associates of Mr. Giuliani were the same individuals named in the 22 July report by OCCRP, referenced above.\"\n\nIn other words, the OCCRP July 22 report has a muted impact on the whistleblower's statement, and Shellenberger's statement that \"\\[t\\]he CIA whistleblower complaint cited a long report by OCCRP four times\" attempting to frame this as a high reliance on the July 22 report is specious.",

The likely truth - assuming DSN's sourcing and reporting is valid - of USG funding links to OCCRP is highly questionable and needs to be known.\n\nUnfortunately, this will simply be used as more ammunition to support what is likely to be an even more corrupt administration than the last. The details and the players will change but the end result will still be a disdain for transparency and fairness (far more so in fact if things continue as they are).  \n  \nI don't know about anyone else here but I am more careful openly criticizing the current Trump administration than those previous, including Trump's first term.
