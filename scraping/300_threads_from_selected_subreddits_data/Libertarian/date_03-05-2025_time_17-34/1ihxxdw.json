If they fired all these people we wouldn't have to be spending so damn much on taxes for education and they could become far more limited in range instead of bloating it.

The biggest costs that I have seen and disagree with in k-12 are vanity projects and big football stadiums. However there are a lot of costs I can get behind, like making schools double as storm shelters and have safety equipment like fire sprinklers and self-locking doors, camera systems, HVAC, etc. are all probably worthwhile investments. I do live in Texas and I\u2019m only familiar with our system but it runs lean. My local school district is closing something like 12-14 schools this summer to bring up efficiency.",

For the 17 year old test, they restrict data reporting to students that score between 250 and 350. This further restriction makes it virtually impossible for scores to change significantly.\n\n\u2060If we look at the math test specifically, it requires that students complete the entire exam without a calculator. All math above pre-algebra is taught with calculators. \n\nStarting in 1975, the US has required special needs children to receive an education. This costs more money. \n\nWhat has the increase in spending gone towards? Are more services being provided in schools? Providing more meals, pre-school programs, after school programs, funding for extra curriculum? How are graduation rates, how are college admission rates, other standardized test scores, job placement rates? How do these things all trend over the same time period? \n\nHow do these numbers compare to other public education systems?

It is likely highly asymmetric in utilization due to the need for more care for special needs kids.\n\nIf Employees go up the total costs going up fits the expected. My question is why employees are up as kids remain constant. It is up so much that either every teacher has 5 managers, or there are teachers not assigned to equivalent number of students (hence my special needs students guess).",

For one, technology has advanced well beyond what it was in the 70s and the tech requirements for schools along with it. I definitely do want my kids at a school where they\u2019re exposed to using technology.  \n  \n2. What is the comparison of number of employees? Is this per school, in total, what? For one, schools now need an IT department, but that doesn\u2019t seem like it would double the employees on its own. We for sure have more students now than in the 70s, population has risen 68% since 1970, so with that fact alone, this doesn\u2019t seem too surprising.  \n  \n3. Why has enrollment barely changed? Is this as a percentage of school-aged kids? This feels a bit misleading as there are most certainly way more students now than 50 years ago.  \n  \n4. Test scores haven\u2019t moved which is the most concerning. I do know that tests themselves have changed, but I don\u2019t know much about the relative difficulty of the tests now vs 50 years ago. The relative test scores as shown here may not be a great measure of performance, but there\u2019s no real way to know for sure with the information given.  \n  \nI\u2019m for sure not here to say that there\u2019s no waste in schools, but I can tell you that I could make a chart tell any story I want it to and that\u2019s why I\u2019m skeptical of these things without more information about the data being presented.",

My parents showed me an article from 1987 where my school got a grant for $20,000 to buy 8x of the apple IIe.  $20k adjusted for inflation is $57k today, which would buy you 30 top of the line Mac book pros.\n\n2) IT departments rarely are massive.  In every school district my wife has worked, and every company I've been at, IT has never been more than 2% of the workforce.  I'll tell you what has changed - each school used to have an AV tech and a nurse.  Now, it's rare to have a full time nurse, and AV techs have been replaced by integrated smart boards.\n\n3) this shows public school enrollment.  Private school, charter and parochial enrollment has skyrocketed in the last 30 years.  Secondly, while the population doubled, people went from having 2.8 kids in 1970's to just 1.5 kids today.  The census shows the population ages 5-18 is the lowest as a % of all it has ever been.  1 in 6 Americans are over 65 in 2020, while in 1970 it was 1 in 15.\n\n4) tests have changed, but not to make them harder, but to make them easier for reading as a result of having so many foreign ESL (English as a second language) students.  Getting back to point #3, the parents that can send their students to better school do it.  That leaves the less well off students at public school.  \n\nThere are plenty of good smart kids at public schools, but if you simply use top college entry as a metric to measure, private and parochial students get into top universities at a rate 3x that of public school graduates.  A 2023 us news article showed that 39% of students at ivy League schools came from private, charter or parochial schools, yet public schools make up 87% of high school graduates.  So 13% of high school graduates take up 39% of ivy League spots.",
