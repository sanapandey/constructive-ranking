If he really wanted to audit the government, he'd have brought in auditors. What he brought in were engineers to see what contracts Elon could get. He's already said that he could get SpaceX engineers in to \"fix\" the FAA. That's a lucrative contract with regular renewals because his people would have to maintain it.",

But guess what happens to all the money they've allocated to various departments, when the departments can't spend it, because doge gutted them. That surplus *goes back to Congress*.\n\nSo everyone freaking out about Congress increasing spending again, and the debt ceiling, are missing that key factor. Congress can \"spend\" it, but if the departments don't use their budgets, that money goes back to Congress to be used elsewhere the following year. And when Congress gets that money back, they'll know which departments they can cut funding to for next year's budget.\n\nDepending on how well Doge is able to prevent the alphabet soup agencies from spending their ridiculously inflated budgets (no more 30,000 dollar hammers to justify getting a bigger budget next year), we might even see a federal budget surplus at the end of the year, despite tax cuts.",

If the departments don't spend their allocated funds then it was never really spent, and comes back to Congress, whom originally \"spent it\".\n\n>Trump's tariffs have set us up for a -1.5% GDP decrease this quarter\n\nWhile I don't agree with tariffs, it's too soon to speculate how other countries are going to react.
