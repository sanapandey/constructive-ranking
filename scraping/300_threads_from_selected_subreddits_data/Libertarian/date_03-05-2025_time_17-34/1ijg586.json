GOP members of Congress applauding Trump's unilateral actions to cut spending because they themselves couldn't do it despite having a unified government at their disposal (and this is not the first nor second time this has happened since 2000, and each time the size of government grew) is the most redacted thing we have seen in government from the GOP. \n\nHonest to Christ. The party that continually descries the nanny state as infantilizing the electorate needs Daddy Trump to step-in and do what they are unwilling to do, the party that is (allegedly) about populism and taking down the elites is cheering on the wealthiest man in the world to make decisions about government programs is cognitive dissonance at its finest. \n\nTrump will be out of politics in four (4) years, but we'll still be saddled with the abject dumpster fire that is Congress.",

I think it is so important for people to understand this stuff.\n\nFirst let me say that I worked as in Statistics and Data Analytics for Amazon for over a decade. I grew up near DC, and I have lived in California, New York, Chicago, Detroit Phoenix, Tennessee, Virginia, Texas, Florida, and North Carolina over the past 20 years, so I have met and engaged with people from every swatch of the country, and with all sorts of political leanings. I have always considered myself politically independent, but if I were forced to choose a party, it would be libertarian. I definitely have a bias against the two major parties, but I think I am pretty unbiased between the two of them, because I think they are both terrible. \n\nI am going to tell you why I think the DNC is just as bad as the GOP. If you had said the opposite, I would be presenting the opposite. I want to be clear that I am in no way saying the GOP is better, I am saying the DNC is just as bad, but they do a much better job hiding it.\n\nNow for my analysis if the article and its claims. Right at the top the tweet sized highlights are misleading. \u201cTrumps final budget ended in September 2021 with a total deficit of 2.77 trillion\u201d immediately tells me that this is a biased piece. Nothing about COVID, just throwing a number out there in a tweet sized sentence at the top of the page that looks terrible with no context.\n\nAfter I read this header I went straight to the sources website, and sure enough the entire board of directors for this \u201cnonpartisan nonprofit\u201d is from Southern California, they are all registered democrats, one of them was an elected Democrat congressmen for the state of California, and one of them owns the left leaning publication: \u201cThe Philadelphia Inquirer\u201d. They can try to be nonpartisan, but the fact of the matter is they are probably not hiring many Republican researchers at this nonprofit, and people\u2019s lean has a way of showing through if you are looking for it. \n\n\u201cJoe Biden decreases the deficit by 50% in his first fiscal year\u201d well I fucking hope so, we shut the entire country down for COVID and started printing money. I find it infuriating that the left put insane public pressure to shut the country down, then after the fact they misrepresent stats to make it look like Biden controlled spending better than Trump. Throw out the two COVID years and you can literally draw straight line trending up on the annual deficit through both Trump and Biden, but I guess let\u2019s pat Biden on the back for doing better than when the country was shut down for two years\u2026\n\nAs for Obama, the total deficit was 0.45T in 2008 and 0.59T in 2016. This article is taking the deficit number in 2009, immediately after the bailouts were issued, which is incredibly misleading. The bailouts, like COVID, were a bi-partisan fiasco that at best were misguided, and at worst were flat out corruption. The former CEO of the Lehman brothers today has a net worth of $250 million dollars, the former CEO of AIG has a net worth of almost $100 million dollars. None of the people responsible faced any serious consequences, and they are all doing the same shit that was happening back then, meanwhile millions of Americans lost everything including their homes and didn\u2019t receive a dime of government money. Obama oversaw the majority of this disaster, even if he was not in office yet when it started. \n\nTo Obama\u2019s credit, he actually got a lot of that bailout money back, and did well to get the U.S. deficit almost back to where it was before the crisis, so good on him there. This situation is a perfect example of how people can manipulate stats can say what you want them to say. If you just look at total deficit from approved budget to approved budget, Obama looks like a financial hero. If you look at the TOTAL deficit throughout his ENTIRE presidency, he looks like a dumpster fire, and bush looks way better. Context and narrative matters, and unfortunately stats are very easy to manipulate to tell the narrative you want to tell. This is literally my job, I am constantly reminding the leaders I support that stats can be misleading and misinterpreted. \n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember deficit is not the same thing as debt. We SHOULD be running at a surplus every year because we are crazy in debt. Having a deficit of 0.59 trillion dollars when we already had 10 trillion in national debt is not something to be proud of in my opinion. If you had a million dollars in credit card debt, would you be patting yourself on the back that you only accumulated 590k in new credit card debt this year? No.. but here we are with our stupid government thinking that is a win because it was better than the other party\u2019s mishandling of the budget. \n\nAs for Clinton, this family is the most publicly audaciously corrupt family in modern politics. They had $700k net worth when they moved into the White House. They claimed they were \u201cbroke\u201d when the left it. That has been proven false by a left leaning stat checker, they owned a $1.7 million dollar home in NY and a 2.85 million dollar home in DC when they left office, and they put $855k down on the 2.85 million dollar home. Hillary loves to say \u201cwe were broke, we were in debt\u201d, well your debts were mortgages on million dollar homes that you had tons of equity in and your husbands legal bills for sexually assault\u2026 that ain\u2019t broke lady, and it\u2019s baffling to me how this doesn\u2019t insult more people when she tries to claim this narrative. \n\nThere\u2019s an oft-told joke about Hillary and Bill Clinton, which goes like this: The couple are driving along when they stop to get some gas, and it turns out that the attendant is a high-school boyfriend of Hillary\u2019s. As they\u2019re pulling away, Bill says, \u201cJust think \u2014 if you had married him, today you\u2019d be a gas station attendant\u2019s wife.\u201d Hillary shakes her head and says, \u201cNo, Bill, if I had married him, today he\u2019d be president of the United States.\u201d People who like her tell this story like this is a wonderful thing, she is so gritty, and she won\u2019t be denied. Well I tend to think the person who wants nothing more than to be president is probably not who you want. The best leaders are the ones who DONT want to be leader, but who are charged with leadership by those around them. Hillary Clinton\u2019s life goal was to be the first female president, and she would do anything to achieve that, including colluding with her own party to block Bernie, who rightfully beat her in the primary in 2016.\n\nBill Clinton\u2019s presidency ran from 1992-2000, and the dot-com bubble was 1995-2000. Everyone was making money hand over fist, but it was a bubble, so it wasn\u2019t real. From 2000-2002, the Nasdaq lost 78% of its value, which is freaking bonkers. If you simply look at deficit at beginning and end of their term, Clinton gets the benefit, and Bush is left holding the bag, despite Clinton having next to nothing to do with the discovery and insane speculatory monetization of the internet.\n\nI am so sorry for the long as shit response, I am super down for \u201ceveryone sucks\u201d. I don\u2019t think the GOP is worse, I just think they are worse at hiding their incompetence/corruption.",
