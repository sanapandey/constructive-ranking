Although the funds have held marketable securities in the past, they typically and currently own only special U.S. debt issued expressly for use by the trust funds. **In contrast to the Treasury securities sold to the public, which are only guaranteed to return\u00a0face value\u00a0when redeemed at maturity**, **the special issue debt held by the trust funds may be redeemed at face value at any time if needed to meet current obligations.**\n\n>The special government securities come in two types: short-term certificates of indebtedness, which mature on the following June 30, and bonds with a\u00a0[term](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termbond.asp)\u00a0of one to 15 years. The short-term certificates and bonds issued to the Social Security trust funds are not traded in the bond market or available to the public.

These bonds can then be repackaged and sold by the Federal Reserve to other central banks only hence the \"not traded in the bond market nor available to the public\" language or covered by printing $$$.

I see the value in the concept of making people save for retirement, even if they don't want to, because a lot of people are immature and irresponsible. And if you force them to save at least SOMETHING, then it's less likely for them to become a total drain on society later in their lives.\n\nThe important part in my idea is to give each individual the ability to manage their money, as it promotes a sense of ownership and hopefully leads to a more responsible and long term mindset when it comes to finances. As well as increasing the potential returns on their investments. If someone wasn't interested in doing anything with their money, then it could just stay in a money market fund, which would still yield more interest than what SS gives, or an S&P 500 type index fund.",

It takes money from the young and only gives back some of it later on in life, by which time they have increased illness and a lower quality of life from being economically worse off.

Those who can't pay enough in or used more were/are also supposed to get some from those who did not live long enough to pull out.  This second part bugs me a little more but if handled properly I could be OK with it. \n\nHonestly I'd really like to see it set up more like my family trust. Grandpa saved well, grandma lived off it until her passing. What was left has been allocated to their children, who now have an option to pay in growing their allocation. If my dad passes before exhausting his allocation, it is then split between me and my subilings... Trust me I'm not a trust fund baby and more than likely only recieve a few hundred if anything out of this trust by the time (God willing) dad dies of old age... also the trust is capped at my generation if I should die before exhausting my allocation if any, it will be transferred to my siblings or closed and distributed to our survivors as cash...
