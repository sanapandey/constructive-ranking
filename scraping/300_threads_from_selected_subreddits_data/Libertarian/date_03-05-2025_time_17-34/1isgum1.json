Racism helped, but obedience enabled. Germans still have that worship for authority ingrained in their souls from childhood. Now, there is just a different authority. They are the type of people to sit at a broken red light with nobody around, waiting for hours for the green light. Liberty was thrust upon Germans, not won through revolution. In that regard, I'm not sure they even understand it. They go through the motions, but until they understand it, it's meaningless. It's been so disappointing as I've become an adult that the idea of a nation so readily able to shirk an evil past and become free is not fully true.\n\nEdit: Typos",

I believe that a person's beliefs can be changed.

No. Regardless, these aren't my countries to make radical changes in. If I want my country to be tolerant, and avoid the tolerance paradox, I can't expect every other autonomous country to do the same. I can, however, support their right to not be bombed. The tolerance paradox is inapplicable to enforce on a world scale in my opinion because there is no governing body to do so.\n\nNot tolerating people's hateful beliefs is different than allowing them to be killed.",
