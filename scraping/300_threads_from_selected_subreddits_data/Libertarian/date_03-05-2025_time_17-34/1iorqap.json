Let\u2019s cut it out. But let\u2019s also be honest about where it is. This fixation on USAID is chump change. When are they going to audit the pentagon?",

If it's happening hundreds or thousands of times every year, it starts to add up to serious money.",

Actual corruption takes investigation with more than software engineers.\n\nAll I've seen so far is Elon Musk finding legitimate funding or spending on companies owned by democrats and bitching about it.\n\nIT'S Sensatiionalism\nIt will be OMG we gave Toyota 100m for DEI Cars. We're going to make America great and buy it from Tesla for twice the price\n\nI worked with defense contractors on their financial systems. The problem  whole system is God awful.\nThe overhead and regulations is why you get $2,000 toilets. Deregulation is needed but has to be balanced with oversight. They've gotten better about not just giving everything to the lowest bidder. \n\nThere's also the fundamental problem that the recipient of the money isn't the one that chose to work. If there's 20 million contract it's posted in public anyone can see it and comment on it and if you meet the qualifications you can bid on it. \n\n\nIt's not the company's fault its a stupid project. \nAnd it's in the budget and was approved by Congress. \n\nSo look at your budget this year and make sure there is no stupid s***in your budget this year. Can't do anything about milk that's already spilt. \n\nWhat they should be doing is looking at existing contracts. We're giving Israel over $20 billion in military gear cancel the contract. Once you kill all these uneededvprojects you can trim the government employees too. \n\nLooking to see how much you've already spent doesn't solve anything if you don't Audit the process that created that overspending. All spending is approved by Congress And is bipartisan. \n\nHaving all spending go through Elon Musk is not the answer\n\nThe reason you know that this is political they're not killing the contracts they're killing the companies if you really want to cut spending you don't give any company a chance to get the money don't Target the companies you don't like",
