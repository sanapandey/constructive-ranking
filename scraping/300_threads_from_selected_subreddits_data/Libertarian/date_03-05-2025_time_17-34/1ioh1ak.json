    "selftext": "There is a utopian idea that evolution assumes that the strongest survive. But this is a utopia that the strongest want to believe in as a myth. Death does not care whether you are the strongest or not. Not only elephants survive, otherwise only elephants would live on our planet. But contrary to the utopian dreams of those who consider themselves the strongest, our planet is a planet of insects, the weakest and the smallest.\n",

The desire to believe in something that does not really exist. Strength is not an advantage in survival. The same elephants are much stronger than any predator, stronger than a lion or a tiger. But an elephant is just a herbivore, another dinner for less powerful predators. Even a horse is much stronger than a wolf, but a horse is just dinner for wolves.",

As you\u2019re well aware, famine is not everywhere at all times.  In fact often good times last as long as the bad.  I haven\u2019t seen studies on what animals succeed in good times, but it seems like most animals survive, and it\u2019s a bit uneven.  This enables changes that would initially be random and have no seeming advantage to occur.   But then as we return to scarcity that extra long bill that just looked funny turns into an advantage. At least that\u2019s what I figure.  \n  \nIt\u2019s really the fittest survive in difficult times.",

But they are the opposite of badass.\n\nFurther, with humans, the most fit are the smartest and most cunning. Those who have directed huge military operations and stuff frequently have not been big bad dudes. Even if they were, they could NOT Have done it alone. It's not about brute strength. It's about outwitting the opponent with good military tactics.\n\nSure, having big sword arms working for you was important in the past, but cunning was always more important. Muscles to dominate in fist fights and wrestling haven't meant as much since the invention of throwing rocks, sneak attacks, and bows and arrows. Since the invention of modern weapons, this kind of strength is meaningless.\n\nWhy fight the opponent in a fair fight with muscles to muscles when you could burn the castle with the opponent inside? Or put them under siege until they are starving and weak? Or ride in on horses and trample the enemy who is on foot? Or set big ass traps? No big bad fist fights needed. Just sneaky heartless military tactics of ancient times.\n\nSo, even in ancient times pure brawn, while more important than today, was still subservient to cunning. Generals who were terrible at tactics would lose miserably even if their soldiers were bigger and stronger physically.\n\nThen, in modern times with modern weapons, brawn means very little. A skinny runner of a soldier with a blaster can take out the biggest, strongest soldier in the world in a split second. Years of sculpting giant muscles, years of constant training in hand to hand MMA shit and \\*poof\\* dead in a second because someone half their size and with zero MMA skill took them out.\n\nHonor means nothing to dead men, and they don't care about whether or not the fight was fair once they're in the grave, and the soldier who defeated them unfairly doesn't give a fuck either.",
