    "selftext": "A naive idea of morality is the following.\n\n\n\nSay someone do something immoral. Then you \"reason\" and show his wrong way. Then he agree and change his mind and now become a good person.\n\n\n\nImagine a religious leaders having anti blasphemy laws. You are a liberal philosopher saying blasphemy is against humans' freedom. Then the religious leaders, like Khomeini, agree. Okay, no more blasphemy laws. Anyone can say any religion is utter bullshit. It's freedom of speech after all. Makes perfect sense.\n\n\n\nThen? Then people won't be religious anymore. Religion is not science. It can't survive too many ridicules and examination. Also religions save other purposes, like making people more cooperative to religious leaders.\n\n\n\nSoon, Khomeini will make less money and be out of job. I supposed he can be a programmer. But under liberal progressive regime, the mere acts of making honest money is punishable by tax. He lost his harem, and his paycheck, and whatever.\n\nIn short, he won't do that.\n\n\n\nTry convince a leftists that genes make you smart and make you economically productive. They WON'T agree. That means if you want your country to be rich, you got to practice eugenic and arrange that the smarter more economically people reproduce. That means their bases, and their kind will go extinct.\n\n\n\nIn fact, even conservatives and even half of libertarians suddenly came up with weird explanation why rich men shouldn't just hire women to join his harem. Child's best interests, women's \"dignity\", the possibility that the women want to marry mediocre instead. \n\n\n\nDoes it make sense? Of course it's not. Child's best interests and women's best interests are best served by simply letting women choose under free market 99% of the time. But nothing will change their mind. Why? Because the idea that good genes produce good money means eugenic and they won't have that.\n\n\n\nOn severe cases, we have Armenian genocide and Holocaust. When a minority groups earn more money fairly and squarely, somehow they're \"wrong\" or evil. Are they? Hard to say. When the world is not capitalistic, then yea people win by being mean and deceptive. What do we expect? We are all evil and hypocrites.\n\n\n\nBut this is the catch, most people don't think that far. Most people think right is right, and wrong is wrong, including the very person that's moral.\n\n\n\nBehind every \"morality\" there is an agenda, agenda that serves some people. And those people will defend the stories, the teaching, the beliefs, irrelevant of \"morality\". How could they believe things that way despite evidences? I would be surprised if evidences means anything.\n\n\n\nRemember, humans are selfish. Those who are not selfish and do WHATEVER to get rich bang hot bitches produce fewer children and go extinct. You don't see them anymore.\n\n\n\nHumans are so hypocritical. It's just reality.\n\n\n\nAnd we didn't even realize we're hypocritical. \n\n\n\nNow, let's think this way. If others do whatever it takes to get what they want, is it fair for us to limit ourself with imaginary morality?\n\n\n\nShould we? I don't know the answer to that question.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps, it makes sense to make the game more fair first, and then winning through any mean, becomes winning the economically productive mean.\n\n\n\nFor example, jailing thieves, but legalizing porn, will make people win productively.\n\n\n\nWill people agree? No. So they gonna come up with some ways to undermine capitalism. The best and brightest will cheat their way to the top. Then the poor will, more correctly say the smart win because they cheat.\n\n\n\nPerhaps just showing the game, the real game, or making a better game where people are better off supporting capitalism than don't would work.\n\n\n\nSome efforts, like private cities, in Prospera, or some semi socialist libertarian like Georgism with UBI, are efforts to try that too. Another way is to exchange things that are too complex to understand to more people to be something closer to automatic simple transactions. That's what Moldbug do when he promoted joint stock corporations model of government. The people do not need to know the complexity of governing, they need only to know whether their share prices and UBI go up or down.\n\n\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution\\_of\\_morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_morality)\n\n\n\nWe are doing fine with what we have fortunately. The more things are honest, explicit, and transactional, something most people, ironically out of moral reasons, try to obfuscate, the more we came up with mutually beneficial arrangements. \n\n\n\nThat's all.",
