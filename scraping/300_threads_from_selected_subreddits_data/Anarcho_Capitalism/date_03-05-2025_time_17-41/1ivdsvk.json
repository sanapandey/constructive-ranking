    "selftext": "I like Henry George. \n\nInstead of government selling land, government should just rent land and that's equivalent of land taxes. \n\nLand tax simply change the way people buy land. Normally we buy land from government and government has perpetual obligation to honor those land and we have no obligation. I think it's more stable to just rent land from government and that is what land taxes is. For the same reason you don't buy slaves, you hire them peace by peace. For the same reason you don't marry women. You hire them one month at a time. \n\nLand value taxes also lower value of taxes. So white farmers in South Africa can expand their farm land more easily because they don't need to buy land. Just rent that for a few years. \n\nLand taxes is also more stable. Would government of Zimbabwe kick out white farmers if those farmers pay land taxes? Way to go to lose lots of revenue. \n\nIf land is owned and the buyer already paid in front huge money then it makes sense to seize land and kick the owners. They already paid for the land price in full. The government don't need them anymore. But if land taxes is high, land is effectively rented from government and kicking land owners out will be proboematic. \n\nSquating will be solved too. If your land is squatted on you just leave and let the squatters pay land taxes. Government, if run like business will drive squatters out and put you back. \n\nYou also don't sign contract with KFC and let KFC supply fried chicken for you for life. You pay for chicken when you want chicken.\n\nIn general, splitting big transactions into smaller transactions are one of the best way to enforce contracts without government. \n\nTurning buying land into paying land taxes solved that. \n\nFull georgism is problematic. But he has the right idea\n\nProblem with georgism\n\nWhat about if you want to build skyscraper? Here buying the land or paying it for 100 years make sense. \n\n\n\nWhat about miners? Someone figure out a land have good buy land and mine gold. If he can't buy the land such opportunities are wasted. \n\nWhat about cradle to grave welfare recipients? They now have more UBI. I think the fact that welfare recipients got UBI should motivate voters to make being cradle to grave welfare recipients difficult. \n\nBut overall land taxes make more sense than income taxes. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism\n",

So in effect, you can become unable to retain your property simply through actions of other people.\n\nSuppose you open a small coffee house in a little provincial town. You pay your Georgist tax. But suddenly the town becomes a popular tourist destination, more people move in and value of the land starts to go up.\n\nAnd so does your Georgist tax. And it can go up so much that it will blow your margins and you'll have to sell off your coffee house simply because you can't afford the prime location anymore.\n\nThis will lead to concentration of land being accessible only the entities with high enough efficiency or capital to sustain the high taxes, such as big corporations, etc...",

Land's not special, it's not the only thing \"they aren't making more of\" (high value land gets made all the time), and most importantly, *it's non-fungible, meaning some faceless bureacrats are going to be the ones deciding on the pricing of any given piece of it, not the market.*\n\nThird, it's a wealth tax, and if there's a wealth tax that's ever been successful long term at any point in history, I'm sure we'd all get a giggle looking at the Laffer curve on it. \n\nLastly, it's still taxation, and taxation is theft.",
