A totally privatized country would be as \u201cclosed\u201d as the particular inhabitants and property owners desire. It seems clear, then, that the regime of open borders that exists de facto in the U.S. really amounts to a compulsory opening by the central state, the state in charge of all streets and public land areas, and does not genuinely reflect the wishes of the proprietors.\nWith every locale and neighborhood owned by private firms, corporations, or contractual communities, true diversity would reign, in accordance with the preferences of each community.\nThe prohibitions would not be state imposed, but would simply be requirements for residence or use of some person\u2019s or community\u2019s land area. While statists who have the itch to impose their values on everyone else would be disappointed, every group or interest would at least have the satisfaction of living in neighborhoods of people who share its values and preferences. While neighborhood ownership would not provide Utopia or a panacea for all conflict, it would at least provide a \u201csecond-best\u201d solution that most people might be willing to live with.",

It\u2019s the absence of strict formal codification of the and enforcement thereof. \u201cAnarchy\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cno rules,\u201d it means \u201cno rulers\u201d (mid 16th century: via medieval Latin from Greek anarkhia, from anarkhos, from an- \u2018without\u2019 + arkhos \u2018ruler\u2019.) That may seem like splitting hairs, but that difference is important. A stateless society would still have rules, contracts, tort law, courts, etc, they would just be private and decentralized rather than centralized and monopolistic. The main difference is they would be implemented from the bottom-up rather than the top-down. Methods of enforcement would involve private security firms incentivized to deescalate, insurance companies, etc. Austrian Economist and Anarcho-Capitalist Bob Murphy, PhD did a great job of explaining what that would look like [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SQsObJlzI2U).\n\nA good example would be gated communities. You can not enter without permission, and if you are given permission, you must obey the communities rules and guidelines or risk being kicked out or even banned.",
