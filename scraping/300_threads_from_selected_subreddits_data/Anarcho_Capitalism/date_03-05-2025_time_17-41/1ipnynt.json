    "selftext": "JD Vance's speech at the Munich Security Conference today is really worth a watch. He took a page out of Milei's book, and castigated the audience right in front of him. It's amusing to see the scattered applause to some of his points, while the rest of the hall are looking around to take note of whom dared show support. \n\nHis slated review of European politics, democracy and freedom of speech is basically calling out the emperor without clothes. But of course, almost all politicians here have their head so far up their own as, they are plain delusional with no ability of self-reflection. The press is working overtime paint Vance as irresponsible, and to make sure there's no \"Hans, are we bad guys\" wake-up calls (because that would be misinformation).\n\nAlthough maybe not by intent, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany's president, summed up the arrogance, inertia and elitism that governs Europe: *\u201cIt is clear that the new American administration holds a worldview that is very different from our own. One that shows no regard for established rules, for partnerships or for the trust that has been built over time. But I am convinced that it is not in the interest of the international community for this worldview to become the dominant paradigm.\u201d*\n\n",

He's also a politician, so it goes without saying he's a self-centered liar and hypocrite. But I find that in this case, it really doesn't matter. He's just the messenger. The boy who called out the emperor's lack of clothes is irrelevant.\n\nRather, it's what he said that matters, and more importantly the absolutely delusional cry-baby reactions of the European counterparts. Just take a look at some of the responses from Germany and UK in today's newspapers. They are really so full of themselves, they fail to realize their own failures and hypocrisy even when it's spelled out to them. And they're baffled when voters pick any other option at the ballot. And then proceed to cancel or reject the outcome when it's not to their liking.\n\nVance is spot on when asking what values Europe really are fighting for.",

Read the extensive Wikipedia page on Censorship in the United Kingdom. There are several Reddit sub and forums dedicated to the topic.\n\nI'd also recommend Glenn Greenwald's book about Snowden \"No Place to Hide\" (2014). Besides Snowden, he talks about surveillance, which is closely related to the problem of censorship.\n\nLook into the government \"information\" campaigns and reprisals for thinking the wrong thing during the covid debacle. Again, there's plenty of subs to browse.\n\nRead Orwell's 1984 if you haven't done so already.\n\nAnd beyond UK, look at what players like the WEF or Ursula von der Leyen have to say about so called \"misinformation\" and how they'd like to tackle it.\n\nI think that should give you a good footing to discuss.\n\nGood luck!",

He starts talking about social issues with his platform against some dude praying.  They literally don\u2019t care and deal with that their own way.  He doesnt read the room and in his American self important way, goes on a Ghdafiesque tirade about his own agenda.  The Europeans have their own way of doing things and he just, he\u2019s like a bull in a china shop.  He gets his point across, but he just isnt well received because it doesn\u2019t come from a place of understanding who the Europeans are, how they operate, or what is really important right now.  Everyone in that room was like \u201cdon\u2019t lecture me farm boy.\u201d  He talked down to them, and they are probably all smarter than him.  Maybe not as politically savvy, but genuinely smarter.\n\nI just don\u2019t understand why the republicans are so unapologetic in the way they speak to other countries and our allies.  It\u2019s like the democrat/republican discourse in our country is all they know and apply it to the whole world like that\u2019s the way it is.  The world sees our clown show and think it\u2019s abysmal.  Instead of arguing facts, we argue talking points.  Instead of dealing with issues, we bandwagon peoples support to place people in power.  Pandering instead of interfacing.\n\nThere is so much \u201cextra,\u201d above and beyond the actual issues that get both sides of our political parties sucked in and then we/they, think that\u2019s the reality and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s done.  The Europeans see right through it, they are just so pissed that idiots are in charge of a power they need.  \n\nEveryone in that room might have understood what he was saying but were looking at him in distain in the delivery.  And wondering what some dude praying outside an abortion clinic has to do with 1.5 million people dying in a war.  Women raped.  Families murder execution style..  but yeah, the travesty of a guy getting arrested for praying and then released with a warning\u2026 that, THAT is the big issue we need to talk about right now.\n\nLet alone his stupid quip about Greta.  You have to be an idiot to not think global warming is a thing.  Like\u2026 absolutely an idiot.    Can I ask what is so wrong with clean energy?  Even if it\u2019s not about global warming, would you rather suck air from an exhaust pipe, or stand next to a wind turbine.",

Followed by ad hominem attacks and poking at some fringe examples. Admittedly, his weren't very good, and focused on religious issue, but that's on him.\n\nAlready beyond Vance's speech, it is oh so telling to see the reactions from German and European politicians today. They are just in complete denial about freedom of speech, concepts of democracy. God forbid one of the parties with most votes has a say in the government of the people who voted.\n\nAnd when I said he's calling the emperor naked, it is first and foremost in regards to freedom of speech. I hardly know anybody in Europe who believe it should be allowed to say anything not sanctioned by the government. In the last years, there have been innumerable inane cases of censorship and curtailing of speech. That's the problem. And whatever anybody thinks about Vance has no bearing on that.",

Just seemed like he was artificially trying to put them on the back foot when it comes to the upcoming talks and it didn\u2019t come off well, or in the eyes of the Europeans, come off at all.  Because they arent stupid.  They know they are highly progressive, and in being progressive they tread on uncharted territory, and maybe some protestor did get arrested unduly, but maybe that many more people felt freedom of motion to go about their day they way they want, unmolested by the same guy.  Just because it\u2019s not status quo or traditional, doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t exist. And if they each took negative action, they wouldn\u2019t need to worry about these laws and this discussion.  Live and let live.  But they both stoke the other, and to the point where a group of people say there needs to be a law.  Because people can\u2019t help themselves.\n\nNow, about the migrant crisis.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  These countries are not themselves anymore.  Losing identity and it\u2019s not working out.  Maybe that\u2019s the same for these progressive experiments.  But still, it was a bit of a jab.  When the real issue is security risks across their borders, and the Russian Ukrainian war.",

If you read what actually happened the guy involved was doing it deliberately as a protest. I should highlight it is absolutely ok to protest abortion, just not outside clinics, that\u2019s what the law is for. Also the bit about Scottish people not being allowed to pray in their own homes near a clinic is just made up, the MSP who wrote the actual bill came out and confirmed that is in no way true. So, as a UK person, I am more confused, how can a vice president of any country, get up on stage, point a finger at the UK leader, using made up anecdotes? Bizarre",
