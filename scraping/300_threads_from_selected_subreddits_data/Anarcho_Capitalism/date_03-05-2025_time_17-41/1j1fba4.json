You just repeated yourself and stated it was reality.\n\nIt's a cop out because it dodges criticism by stating what's literally happened, as if because it happened, it's justified.\n\nMaybe if you don't like what I have to say, you can find a different sub without me there? That's your argument, isn't it?\n\nEdit: This guy blocked me for disagreeing with him. How unsurprising.",

Would you mind doing that?\n\nOr you could just block me like gunkslinger did lmao",
