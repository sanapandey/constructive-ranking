In the case of DEI, we have to consider that (a) DEI undermines the principle of meritocracy but that (b) it is up to the individual business as they have the right to discretionary hiring. On racism, Rand said that businesses ought to be allowed to discriminate because that is their right, but that anti-racists would boycott those particular businesses and the invisible hand of the free market may or may not drive them out of business/force them to be tolerant. This can be applied to hiring policies as well in that companies that don't follow meritocracy won't be nearly as good as those that do, leading to free market enforced meritocracy. But it isn't necessarily all that simple as DEI seems to be an attitude which is consuming society in spite of efficiency. Why? I suppose the socialists who are largely proponents of this would argue that economic efficiency is not the main factor which drives the masses, but the intrinsically social nature of human beings and conservatives/liberals would argue that socialists are using the internet and media to manipulate our emotions and indoctrinate us. We can't say who is right for certain, but we can say that DEI is an anti-meritocratic, anti-capitalist attitude that should be fought against in order to improve society.",
