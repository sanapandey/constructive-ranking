But I'm honestly ignorant and curious.\n\nIf Russia invading and taking over Ukraine is so bad, that all the Democrats say are founding Trump over it, then why aren't European countries doing more? I know they send supplies and stuff, but if Ukraine is just the first domino, as they imply, why aren't those other domino countries sending their actual militaries to help fight?\n\nI totally understand I'm completely ignorant on this subject, so please go easy on me ",

It is well known that for 30 years we have persistently and patiently tried to reach an agreement with the leading NATO countries on the principles of equal and inviolable security in Europe. In response to our proposals, we constantly faced either cynical deception and lies, or attempts to pressure and blackmail, while NATO, despite all our protests and concerns, continued to steadily expand. The war machine is moving and, I repeat, it is coming close to our borders.\u201d\n\n~ putin February 2022",

The problem is that the majority population in Moldova is Romanian speaking, and many (most?) Moldovans are dual citizens, also having citizenship in neighboring Romania. And Romania, a NATO member, cannot stand by if Russia invades Moldova (it is forced to protect its citizens, the last few times Russia invaded that region it led to literal genocides). That means WW3. That is why Russia and the US are so invested now in getting a Russian puppet in power in Romania, since it doesn't really matter who's in power in Moldova (it doesn't have a real army). But Romania is thwarting the Kremlin plans due to its very anti Russian pro Western fairly Christian population.",

As long as money comes from some distance source, flows through your hands and you get a small percentage of it, and then goes out to a cause that is being made popular through the media, then we're all making money and we maintain the status quo. \n\nFor 5 years, the money source has been the USA. It flows through everybody's hands, everybody gets their little piece of it, and that's why the war has continued without end. \n\nDamn, somebody upset the apple cart. America's not footing the bill anymore. Who wants to step up and provide billions upon billions of dollars? Remember, we are Europe and we're on the take, so we're not going to step up and pay for it out of our pockets.\n\nCall this Vietnam 2.0.   In Vietnam, they had a great money pipeline set up, and everyone was making money hand over fist, except for that one pesky little detail. The body bags had Americans in them. That was the great undoing, that turned Americans against the war. Otherwise, we'd still be fighting it. \n\nUkraine is Vietnam 2.0, the improved edition. It's a great money pipeline, but new and improved. It's not Americans in the body bags, it's ukrainians. Now all the Americans don't mind an endless war, because it's not our people in the body bags. \n\n\"Fer Freedumb !\"",

They were saying that they would help Ukraine as much as possible, but not too much because they didn't want nuclear war. This sounds pretty logical. So the goal doesn't seem to be to prolong the war for the sake of prolonging the war, but rather for helping Ukraine fend the Russians for as long as possible but without crossing some red line that can lead to nuclear war. The war is not meant to be won, but it's meant to wear out the Russians until they find some other hobby (just like what Vietnam, Afghanistan, or the original 13 British colonies did).",

You'd be starting another chain of escalation dominoes that can fast track towards nuclear war, and everyone is scared of that. \n\nUkraine is being used as a meat shield for Europe so that they don't have to begin a scary possibly nuclear war with the aggressive Russians. And Europe is sending money and aid to Ukraine to aid them in the war. I would argue not enough and that aid should be upped if they want Ukraine to sufficiently defend itself, but that is the situation, everyone wants the benefit of Ukraine protecting them from Russia but nobody wants to pay for it, kind of a Prisoners dilemma situation where Europe was happy to let the US foot the bill and reap the rewards themselves while spending far less. \n\nNow that Trump is revealing himself to be unwilling to aid Ukraine anymore, Europe will have to step up and increase their support, which is what will happen if Ukraine doesn't accept the horrible deal that Trump is 'offering'.",

The current Russia is NOT the same as the Soviet Union, there is no reason to assume it will act the same any more than one should assume Germany will still try to invade a bunch of countries because it did in WWII. \n\nYou also should understand the history that happened before Russia invaded.  Ukraine since it was created after the Soviet Union breakup has always had a Russian ethnic east side that speaks Russian and a more western centric anti Russian west side.  Tensions built between the two sides over time. The entire Ukraine is a country cobbled together with territories that were never a single country in the past, it does not have a cohesive single culture.  The east with it's Russian speaking people wanted friendly relations with Russia and access to low cost energy supplies and the benefits of the Russian market place. The west wanted to cut off Russia no matter the cost. Blocking Russian energy badly hurt the economy of the east which was poor already but the west did not care.  The east had a continually degrading economic situation.  At the same time, there was a constant battle between Russia and the EU/USA to control the leadership of Ukraine.  Finally the USA/EU won that manipulation, and there is good evidence the USA used some terrorist tactics to force out the previous leadership. \n\nThe new EU centric leadership started inacting anti Russian rules like banning and altering Russian street names in the east and making decisions that badly hurt the economy in the east. Eventually the eastern regions demanded to break away from Ukraine and become a separate independent territory.  Civil war broke out.  The west would not let the east go and the west had all the tech and EU backing and was winning. Then Russia helped the east.  Eventually a peace deal was made that said if the east voted to leave, they should be allowed to leave. The east did vote to leave but the west claimed it was a corrupted election and still didn't let them leave. \n\nIT was complicated by known Nazi fighters from the west (Azov batallion etc) refusing to stop fighting the east separatists even when western leaders told them to stop.  These fighters were the main fighting force of the west and still have a lot of power even now, they would make decisions independently and that complicated any attempts at peace.  It is believed Zelensky still fears these factions, and these factions have threatened his death if Zelensky defied them.  So there was almost like a 3 way civil war at this point in Ukraine with both USA/EU and Russia also meddling.  \n\nFor 8 years, western Ukraine bombed Eastern regions of their own country, with the eastern regions insisting they should be independent now by the previous treaty and demanding to be left alone and trying to keep the west from taking back their  territory using support from Russia. Russia demanded the previous treaty be honored but the west said nope and made counter accusations against Russia meddling. \n\nEventually Russia decided to just go into the ethnic Russian territories and take control and end the fighting.  THe USA and Eu then jumped in on the other side, hence the Ukraine war you now have.   Why did the EU not do more? I think some of the EU countries are not fully convinced Russia wants anything more than the rest Russian speaking territories that are already fairly pro Russian.  Some of the others were likely happy to let the USA pay for it since Biden volunteered.  The Eu and now also the USA are kinda screwed now as we already sent Ukraine close to all of our stock of ammo and shells and we are slow to make more since we do not have good manufacturing, unlike Russia.  \n\nAnd the EU economies are sinking like breaks of lead due to no longer having access to low cost Russian energy and already spending a lot of money on Ukraine. Frankly the UE does NOT have the money our resources now to do what the USA was doing, even the USA does not have it really, all that money we sent was borrowed money put on 'credit card' and added to our national debt.  Now our military is also heavily degraded.  Plus Ukraine is losing the war badly despite all the west's best efforts.  It's a money pit that can't be won. Also we risk WWIII if we try to fight Russia directly, they have nukes after all and if you invade them directly, they would probably use them before letting the west conquer Russia. \n\nIf you don't conquer Russian, it can possibly fight forever in Ukraine so there's IMO no winning in Ukraine at this point.  The west had hoped to destroy Russia with sanctions and a proxy war but the Russian economy is surprisingly doing fine, Russia built huge trade agreements with our enemies and also China, and Russia has built many manufacturing facilities to support any war efforts, so the western plans failed pretty badly and some feel the west should cut their losses and stop throwing good money after bad. \n\nSo my question is, why would the EU even want to continue supporting the war?  Some Eu countries just want out of spending money they don't have on a losing war when their own economies are struggling, while others seem convinced Russia wants to invade all of Europe and so they want to continue, so there's internal disagreement in the EU as well.",

However, the fear of Russia in that part of the world is justified, since Ukraine is not the only country which was invaded by Russia since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Russia used the same simplistic rhetoric (the supposed desire to protect ethnic minorities) to invade Moldova (where they still have troops!) and Georgia. They have kept funding separatist groups in many neighboring countries, like in Kazakhstan, fomented ethnic strife between Armenia and Azerbaijan, etc. These hotspots created by the Russians are basically an entry point into all of those former republics for Russian troops. Russian authorities also make repeated threats against the Christian European countries nearby (Poland, the Baltics , Romania) which serve as an antidote to Russia's bankrupt economic model. If these countries keep on thriving and Russia stagnates, Russians may eventually find out and ask themselves what their leadership is doing wrong. The Russians are itching for a fight, and their economic model is disastrous - leaving their leadership with only one option of appeasing their impoverished and oppressed population: conquest and oppression of new regions.",

So there were precipitating events that lead up to the full invasion, that was an escalation of war, not the actual start of it.  Plus the west has since repeatedly touted the war as a great way to damage Russia through a proxy war and it's quite likely that a peace agreement between Putin and Zelensky was worked out very early in the war but the west sent Blair to scuttle it, thus it is likely the west wanted the war and did things to make it more likely.  \n\nI'm actually surprised personally that Russia came out with the winning end of this stick, I was certainly not betting on them doing this well back when this started.  So i can see why the USA at the time thought this was a good plan, I mean historically the USA does not care if a lot of people die as long as the USA gets what it wants.  By knocking Russia out of the EU energy markets, they now are forced to pay premium rates for imported USA energy, so the energy market here did benefit but the USA people won't see much of that benefit sadly.",

Now they have to rebuild their stockpiles because Russia invading them is now no longer unthinkable. \n\nThe US does have surprisingly large stockpiles of stuff, but even then they are running concerningly low on things like 155mm artillery shells. A lot of that stuff which was nearing the end of its shelf life got sent to Ukraine on lend-lease, but even though the chances of anyone invading the US is unthinkable, it\u2019s seems we now live in an era where the unthinkable is turning into a daily occurrence.",

They do, however, provide\u00a0weapons, training, intelligence and financial aid. If European or NATO countries sent their troops into Ukraine, Russia could\u00a0justify retaliating against those countries directly, potentially turning the conflict into a\u00a0World War III scenario. Instead, the West has chosen to\u00a0arm Ukraine\u00a0so it can defend itself.\n\nGermany, UK, France, Poland and others\u00a0have sent tanks, air defense systems, ammunition and other military hardware.

This is not a war about freedom, its about defending democracy which is just the tyranny of the majority. It makes no difference whether ukraine remains its own state or becomes a part of russia. What does matter is that as long as the war continues people are dying and money is being wasted on weapons. Ukraine is not innocent in this situation, they force young men to fight and die for this hopeless and pointless war. All they have to do to stop the bloodshed is wave the white flag and call themselves russia. But zylensky doesnt want to do that because then he goes back to being a nobody and stops getting billions from the US.
