And furthermore, it's not like they make any real attempt at hiding much of this.\n\nRather, it's first and foremost theft (taxation), waste (bureaucracy), and grifting, rent-seeking, possibly corruption, clientelism.\n\nNow, highlighting and reducing the waste part is of course a good start. However, an even better approach would be stopping the theft. That would automatically reduce the other issues down the pipeline.",
