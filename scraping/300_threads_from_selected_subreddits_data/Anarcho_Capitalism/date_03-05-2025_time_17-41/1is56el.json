Biden and the zionist congress wanted to ban TikTok and they removed it for weeks from the Apple App Store. Thanks to Trump we have it back. Demoncrats hate Trump just because he aint a black woman like drunken Kamala Harris. Demoncrats are like little kids that care more about the rhetoric and the image of a person rather than the actual acts of the person.  ",

That explains exactly why you would post this here.\n\nLook, I don\u2019t mean to attack you...it\u2019s not about you, and I get that you\u2019re looking for a new home. It\u2019s just that this place is swarmed lately with people who think statism with a different face is somehow a new liberty. I just wish the real ancap threads weren\u2019t all watered down right now so you could actually see what this philosophy is about, instead of getting stuck in another flavor of bootlicking. Why is it bad if one person restricts your use of an app, but somehow better if another grants you permission? Should either have that power?\n\nIf you\u2019re serious about exploring ancap ideas, I\u2019d suggest looking past the current  \u2018less government, but my government\u2019  shit getting repeated every other thread now, and actually attempting to undestand real anti-state, voluntaryist principles.  Its just sad to see how fast this feels like the whole sub has been erased, and I feel if none of us say anything its just gong to be gone soon",

If government can arbitrarily tax, spend, and regulate, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s run by a 'good guy' or a 'bad guy', you\u2019re still a subject, not a free individual.\n\nA core ancap thought is that all government is inherently coercive and therfore illegitimate. Rothbard, for example, would say that even a government that promises to shrink itself, is still a government enforcing taxation, regulations, and monopolizing law  to control you with threat of force. Accepting state power to reduce state power is an illusion thats actually part of the playbook for expanding government control over time\n\nPeople often make that mistake, that Anarchy means no rules. Thats not what it is about. To me, its about having order, without a ruler. That no other perosn has the ability to take away your ability to use an app, or grant you the permission to use it. That we can have order without hierarchy over each other. Supporting a lesser oppressor doesn\u2019t lead to liberty, it just delays the next oppression.\n\nAnyway, I get that you want to talk about TikTok and cheer for a president you align with. That doesn\u2019t affect me which leader you prefer. But it\u2019s disappointing to see a place that once existed to discuss voluntaryist ideas shift into just another politically aligned echo chamber",

Their stated goal is to make the federal government more efficient. It is said that the average person commits 3 federal crimes every day without even realizing it. Would you want the federal government to be more efficient at detecting and prosecuting them?\n\nThey want an efficient government, but that's not the same as less or more liberal (in the classical sense) government. In fact it could be the exact opposite as far as micromanagement and misery of the people is concerned.",
