You have Reddit that is still heavily vested in maintaining leftist propaganda. \n\nAnd you have Facebook (and by extension Instagram), which Zuck has claimed to be awakened to the issue he caused by silencing dissenting voices and is allegedly committed to rolling back that overuse of power. But personally I'm not convinced this change of heart isn't just him going into survival mode, being a chameleon and changing his colors to avoid being attacked by a republican lead government. It's still entirely possible and frankly quite likely that he has another \"change of heart\" next time the Dems have control again. \n\nAnd then you have Google and by extension YouTube which are the number 1 and number 2 largest search engines in the world. SERPs (Search Engine Results Page) are heavily manipulated, to get away from \"trusted news sources\" you frequently have to go many pages away from the first page to finally get to alternative sources of news that don't have the US government designation of \"trusted news source\". And YouTube still very famously has manipulated, silenced, and outright suppressed Right leaning media and podcasters. There's countless stories of people looking for their preferred podcast channel and even when searching the specific channel name they can't find it. \n\nNeedless to say, controlling Twitter is far from enough to reliably say these things can't be hidden back in the shadows later down the road",
