Prospera was created under a special economic zone law that allowed it to operate with independent regulations and lower taxes. Investors put money into the project under the assumption that these rules were stable.\n\nThen, the Honduran government declared the law unconstitutional and moved to dismantle Prospera's special status. The lawsuit argues that this amounts to a breach of agreements made with investors, effectively a \"rug pull\" by the government. Prospera is now using international arbitration to seek compensation for lost investments.\n\nThis case isn't about whether private governance works\u2014it's about whether a government can unilaterally revoke economic agreements without consequence. The outcome could shape how similar projects operate in the future.\n\nTL;DR: It's basically a big rug pull by the Honduran government\n\nEither the OP didn't read the original article, didn't understand the original article, or was hoping no one else would read and grok it.
