They believed in socializing the economy while providing a strong nationalistic ideology that persecuted those who were not of Aryan descent. Thankfully, there aren't many, if any, nations that currently exist today that've adopted this ideology.\n\nModern communists countries vary in how closely they do Marx's vision; some more orthodox like North Korea, others more lax like the PRC. In either scenario there's no freedom of speech. What varies is the economic freedoms allowed to you. If you happen to be in one of the few Special Economic Zones (SEZ) in the PRC you'll get a decent bit more market freedom but nothing to write home about as there's still plenty of government overhead. Granted, it's much better than what NK or Cuba have going on but not by much.\n\nI would rather just go to the ends of the Earth where I'll be left alone, instead of being part of any of the societies mentioned.",

            "body": "I would argue that there's fundamentally no difference between fascism and communism. These are more or less synonyms for one another.\n\nFirst, let's break apart each ideology into their base components. Fascism has a dictator, centralized government, suppression of opposition, and a suppression of individualism for the greater good.\n\nCommunism has a dictator, centralized government, suppression of opposition (gulags, for one), and a suppression of individualism for the greater good.\n\nWith small exception, everything else that people might use to define these ideologies is moot.\n\nCommunists and the writers of the ideology itself will try to convince you that it's an opposing force to fascism, but that's because these ideologues can't (or won't) define their terms. Communist writers use doublespeak, falsehood, and subjective value structuring to dictate their belief structure.\n\nFor example, communists will state that communism is, at its core, a stateless, moneyless society, but to say this simply means they don't know what the state, or money, is.\n\nThe state, once you break it down into its fundamental constitute parts, is any monopoly on the use of force that is not contested within its perceived active range. This is why the US government doesn't intercede with the Canadian government, yet they could at any time.\n\nIf the US took control of part of, or all of Canada for example, then the US government would be the monopoly on the use of force in Canada. So even if Canada maintained that they still have their own government, that would be like if I called my land and home a country - it's just words without fundamental meaning.\n\nAnd moneyless doesn't exist because money doesn't exist. Yes, there's printed/minted bills/coins, but that isn't money. Money is an abstract representation of merit that we use to trade with. If I ask my neighbor to mow my lawn and he later asks me to shovel his driveway, I'm probably agreeing to do his driveway BECAUSE he mowed my lawn. In my mind I've tallied up merit from his deeds. Had I shoveled his driveway at his ask and every time I asked him for something he refused, I'd very quickly refuse to continue to help him. That's money - it's the same thing.\n\nAnd you can't do away with it.\n\nCommunism isn't a stateless, moneyless society. Communism is a society where a dictator (or dictators plural) control people through violence so as to force their subjective values onto others. This is literally identical to what fascism is and does. There is no difference.\n\nThere's really only two ways to be politically - political, or apolitical. I argue that what politics itself is, is simply an ongoing debate on when to use force so as to force subjective value structures onto others. Because the moment all you use force for is for self defense, you no longer have government, you just have people protecting themselves.",
