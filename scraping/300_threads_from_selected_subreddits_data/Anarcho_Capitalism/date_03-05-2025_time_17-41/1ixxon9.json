People can - and do! millions of times per day - work within contracts, trade with suppliers, vendors, etc., all without ever falling back on the one entity that has a monopoly on \"legal\" violence in an area.\n\nFor example, as opposed to police, private security would never be able to lock you in a cage (nor would they wish to) for presuming to own your own body (e.g., drug war). \n\nI'm sure that different areas would have different rules (like an HOA, for instance), but as long as the market exists sans legalized arbitrary coercion and force and within a framework of Natural Law, they could all still be anarcho-capitalists.",

I might protect you just because it's the right thing to do, or I might protect you if you protect me, or I might protect you as a career venture, or I might be a part of a business who does protection for people.\n\nPolice are poor protection and generally only a deterrent because governmental services are always poor due to a lack of incentive structure and monopolization. If you ever want a solid real world example of the difference between low and high quality services, just notice what the rich do compared to the rest of us.\n\nRich, gated communities don't rely upon the police. They gate their communities and they hire security guards for the gates and that move around keeping an eye out and who will respond instantly to anything suspicious. Anything poorer than that either has to protect themselves or can call the police after the crime has already occurred.\n\nThe very rich also tend to have private bodyguards, yet many politicians lobby for us not to even be able to own the very firearms we could use to protect ourselves when they themselves are surrounded by people with those very guns to protect them.",

Like virtually all other goods and services, those who found a way to make the highest quality for the lowest cost would put those who could not out of business, and we would be left with high quality security (far superior than police) at half the cost.\n\nDo you know why plumbers and electricians are so expensive? I've done both plumbing and electrical work on my home (finishing our basement). It's not that difficult for some of that work. But when I had a bedroom and bathroom specced out for wiring, the electrical company quoted us $4,000. The work would take around 4 hours and that was using MY materials. So why is it so high?\n\nThe government is why. Because the plumbers and electrician unions lobbied to the government to get them to make mandates stating that in order to become either you have to have certain complicated and expensive permits that it artificially reduces the supply, which increases demand.\n\nWhy can't my neighbor do the work for me at a quarter of the price? Well because he's not - according to the state - a legal entity that can do the work, even if he has 30 years of experience and will do a better job than the people who are certified.",

            "body": "AnCap doesn't just mean \"rugged individualism\" and \"every man for himself,\" with each institution or individual acting as their own enforcement. AnCaps believe that voluntary cooperation is possible (and preferable) as the basis for order and enforcement between individuals, communities, and institutions.  \n  \nThe problem with Black Markets is that they are \"Black\" - as in: they need to hide. Cooperation is thwarted by the state. You can't turn to other institutions because of government threat against you and those institutions. If you remove that threat, then people are free to negotiate with others for fair enforcement. Insurance companies deal with (entirely contradictory) accusations of harm and damages all the time.  \n  \nPeople like to say that we \"need\" a \"single arbiter\" for disputes in the state, because how else would we get a concrete answer for all disputes? Of course you need one (and only one) police agency and one court! But that is wrong on multiple counts.  \n  \nFirst, the goal shouldn't be to answer *every* dispute without fail, because that isn't 100% possible given the subjective nature of humanity and our perspectives. If one law is *always* right, that inherently means some level of oppression in the real world. Our goal is to resolve disputes and to enforce justice as much as possible - not to maintain a homogeneous (but immoral and unjust) order. A heterogenous, but more orderly and just system is preferable to a homogeneous, but less orderly and just one. AnCaps believe we can have the former by abolishing state monopoly on violence and enforcement.  \n  \nSecond, it is factually incorrect to say that disputes with irreconcilable differences are *incapable* of resolution. Again: insurance companies handle this stuff all of the time. When there is an unresolved conflict, neither party is happy, and they are often willing to rely on a third-party or an arbiter (even a private one) so that they can get something they want, even if it isn't 100% of what they want.  \n  \nIn an AnCap legal system, you might have \"gangs\" or such parties that want their way, and maybe they are willing to use violence to get what they want. But others are able to use force in defense as well. And if you want to get help from another institution to resolve a conflict you have, you are going to have a hard time justifying your position to a fair third-party arbiter if your past actions clearly put you in the wrong.  \n  \nAn AnCap system very well may have courts, judges, police, prisons, military, defense, or any number of institutions that we have now. The basis for those institutions we have *now* are based on a foundation of the state, and those institutions function because the vast majority of people accept them. A private version of one of those institutions would *also* function if people accept it. Critics simply claim that a private version wouldn't be accepted, but AnCaps argue that we should expect mechanisms to exist that would make acceptance of those systems to be reasonable.  \n  \nSo the rub really just comes down to the fact that an AnCap society is unfamiliar to people, and they have difficulty even imagining it. This is functionally the same to how people used to feel about slavery. People argued that slavery *had* to be justified, because, of course, *we all know that society would crumble if we got rid of slavery.* There would be anarchy and murder in the streets if we freed the slaves!  \n  \nSeriously. That was the actual opinion people had. It looks dumb in hindsight, right? AnCaps think that law and order could be viewed the same way in a possible future world. That's how I'd describe it.",
