                            "body": "Exactly. There's a lot of room to cut welfare if done correctly. But that's not a high priority when there are so many low-hanging fruits. I would go first for the common sense stuff, the digitalizing everything in a way cuts can be automated, then coming up with fixed rules for dynamic long-term schemes where these programs can be cut over time as the country grows out of the debt problem. At this last stage, any surplus from the cut could reduce the debt and tax cuts, with tax cuts focused first on whoever is poorest and whatever gives the country a competitive advantage.\n\nMusk could consider himself a parasite because of subsidies and Starlink contracts instead of only focusing on bureaucrats. But I don't think he made most of his fortune due to government contracts. Even assuming he somehow pocketed 100% of the subsidies he (and everyone else) received, that would be nothing compared to his fortune. It was about $5bi in total, if I remember correctly. That would be 1.3% of his wealth. The Starlink contracts are also only for specific agencies that need internet in remote locations, and he's providing that at a price lower than retail price, which is already lower than any other alternative. I could see an argument for why the government should not have this kind of internet contract at all, but it's hard to call the current agreements with Starlink crony.\n\nIt's technically impossible for this to be a conflict of interest. Musk can't run for president, so that's not on the table. He's only cutting costs rather than creating new expenses, so the worst he could do is cut everything but his contracts, which would still be a winning situation for everyone. Of course, he benefits from the country spending less because his companies are now part of an economy that's doing better, but that's not a personal conflict of interest.\n\nIt's also important to note that the subsidies leftists call \"corporate welfare\" are just temporary tax cuts. You'd pay, say, 35% to the government in taxes, and now, if you comply with some demands, you'll pay more like 34.999% in taxes to the government. They see it as welfare not because the person is net receiving any money (not contributing and receiving a lot) but because they think they are net receiving money compared to what should be their \"fair share\" in the point of view. And their \"fair share\" is always \"more\" with no specific number or rationale. When you get to the bottom of it, this \"fair share\" is 100% because they believe in the labor theory of value. So that makes sense in their worldview, but there's no reason for non-leftists to go along with that vocabulary that legitimizes theft.",

One is a government contractor, the other is a corporate welfare recipient. No doubt Musk would be extremely wealthy even without government contracts and corporate welfare he received, he had about $1B liquid when he started SpaceX. My argument is that his current net worth of almost half a trillion would be much smaller without everything he received from the government, from cash like incentives to favorable regulations. Who knows if SpaceX and Tesla would take off at all without such preferential treatment. I bet you\u2019ll be able to build an empire if you get the same deal. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be even close to the size of Musk\u2019s companies, after all, I think he is one of the best entrepreneurs out there.

Not that you're not allowed to be one. But discussing anything under these terms is simply not worth it for someone who doesn't share this worldview. Assuming the government not stealing from you or not imposing regulations on you at some point makes you just as parasitic as the government itself makes zero sense outside this leftist worldview. This is basically using the language of the parasites.\n\nSome people make wealth with politics, and people who make wealth in the market. Real people live in the real world where governments exist and must relate to each other at some point. Using that as some form of purism where everyone is just as dirty, even when they're paying much more in taxes than receiving, makes no sense because things can't be any other way. Libertarians falling for these tricks make zero sense. The only possible conclusion after accepting these terms is to defend the larger and larger states because anyone trying anything different is \"just as dirty.\"",

Musk wasn\u2019t poor by any means, he was either low 1 digit billionaire, or maybe just below $1B liquid before he became a government contractor. His net worth exploded after he founded SpaceX and then Tesla. Both companies probably wouldn\u2019t exist without government contracts, subsidies, etc. His calling people that amassed wealth from the state parasites, while I highly doubt Musk would be even close to his current net worth without the government.",

That gosh darn critical thinking, have you ever heard someone say it\u2019s fun?   \n\nLet\u2019s just take the immigrants influx , let\u2019s say the last 5 years only.  These are labeled as \u201cpoor\u201d & \u201c disabled \u201c.  How much total dollars do you think that has cost?  \n\nThen we can also tangent off that and we do know factually, that Americans that are actually \u201cpoor\u201d & legitimately \u201c disabled \u201c are the ones being hurt the most by the immigrants. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s cold but factual\n\nSo this is really a daily double failed dunk.  Using poor and disabled at the very expense of poor and disabled is factually wrong\n\nThe 2nd pay tier at the mutual window( I\u2019m old) about the dollar amounts is undoubtedly wrong\n\nBut alas,  my thinking only comes through pain. We are not conditioned for that thinking. We are conditioned for feelings over facts.  Naturally, i have been described as cold.   \n\nThose are only 2 examples of the poor being exploited by that magic \u201c cause\u201d.   \n\nThe middle class is the absolute victim, not the poor by any stretch of government rules. I think that the poor & rich are the 2 ruling powers, yes the poor . The poor have absolute say in how the middle class ( workers) live.  \n\nThe \u201c dunkmaster\u201d( sarcasm)  is actually completely shitting on the middle class in essence. Here is the kicker, it will be applauded.  Thanks my friend, that was fun",

However, it doesn\u2019t invalidate the dunk in my opinion. Musk made most of his fortune just like the most of the people he calls parasites - government\u2019s cronies, founders of NGOs and other government agencies cut outs, etc. But even then, there are many parasites on welfare. I don\u2019t know what % of people on welfare are parasites, but I know it\u2019s a quite significant number, as I\u2019ve encountered a lot of them myself, and they\u2019ve been calling me an idiot for not exploiting the system. Call me an idiot, but in my perspective, me exploiting the system is equal to me stealing from other hard working people.",

I think empathy is a poison being used against us. I think the dunkmaster is a great example of that.  Musk could go live on the moon for all i care & i would still think his greatest contribution to humanity will be calling these thieves out. People are struggling while the rich get richer, it\u2019s wild to watch one of the richest call these folks out.  The rich in this case, is the democrats. I\u2019m not stumping for Trump or any pol but he is labeled the billionaire right?  His war chests were significantly less than the dems in each election if I\u2019m not mistaken",

I have no idea who\u2019s that Jesse R is, and whether he\u2019s using empathy with bad intentions, or if he truly believes in what he says, or if he simply has an EDS. And i don\u2019t care for Jesse R\u2019s reasons just as much I don\u2019t care if Musk goes to the moon either. Musk calling out those that made their fortunes of the state\u2019s power is hypocrisy. Which is why I consider that comment under his post a good dunk. It\u2019s okay if we disagree on the dunk part, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re the second person that didn\u2019t resort to blindly defending Musk here. I just want to see the snake eating it\u2019s tail, which is happening right now, Musk is doing it with DOGE, and time will tell if he cuts his own subsidies. But I\u2019m appalled what this sub is turning into. Check out other comments. People are saying government contracts is not a corporate welfare. There are some saying \u201cbut Boeing would charge 3 times more\u201d like that\u2019s a good argument for corporate welfare that goes to Musk\u2019s companies. I couldn\u2019t give less of a fuck if Boeing or SpaceX gets my tax dollars. I rather feed a few guys that hang out at my closest gas station more often with some of the money that\u2019s extorted from me, or let someone give that money to those in real need, vs blowing it on some space exploration program.",
