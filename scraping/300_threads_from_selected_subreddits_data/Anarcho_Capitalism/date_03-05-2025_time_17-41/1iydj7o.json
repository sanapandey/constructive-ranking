Lowlights include:\n\nBankrolling the \u201cProject Democracy\u201d program that became the core of Oliver North\u2019s secret government during the Iran-Contra years.\nManipulating the elections in Nicaragua in 1990 to oust Ortega and the Sandinistas.\nOverthrowing the governments of Bulgaria in 1990 and Albania in 1991.\nAnd backing every major color revolution of the modern period, from the Rose Revolution in Georgia to the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan and Orange Revolution in Ukraine a decade ago to the recent unsuccessful \u201cElectric Yerevan\u201d in Armenia, and many others in between\u2026.\nRON PAUL: What about Ukraine? I understand there are a few organizations that have been involved through this in Ukraine, trying to disturb that government. Of course, we have visited on this subject quite a bit, but I didn\u2019t realize how much the NED is involved over there.\n\n \n\nDANIEL MCADAMS: And this is a big issue, because I think the argument could definitely be made that NATO should have ended after the Cold War, but definitely the National Endowment for Democracy should have been ended after the Cold War. Instead, they say, like with every government program, \u201cNo, now\u2019s the time we need more!\u201d\n\n \n\nBut in Ukraine just this past year\u2026Ah, this is an interesting article written by the president of the National Endowment for Democracy\u2014he\u2019s president for life\u2014Carl Gershman. I know this might shock you, but he\u2019s actually a Trotskyite. He was a founding member of a communist breakaway party, the Trotskyite Social Democrats USA. He wrote an editorial in The Washington Post [in] September of \u201913, just before the events happened in Ukraine, and he wrote as the president of the National Endowment for Democracy. He said, \u201cUkraine is the biggest prize.\u201d And he mentioned that \u201cUkraine\u2019s choice to join Europe will accelerate the demise of the ideology of Russian imperialism that Putin represents,\u201d and \u201cPutin may find himself on the losing end not just in the near abroad but within Russia itself.\u201d So his real goal is regime change. He spelled it out just before all of these events took place.\n\n \n\nSOURCE: National Endowment for Democracy? Hardly!\n\nThese types of Trojan horse operations have been used hundreds of times in the past, and there is no sign that the deep state is ready to abandon the trick now. Quite the opposite.\n\nIt worked during the \u201cArab Spring\u201d when even The New York Times blithely admitted that the leaders of the protests had \u201creceived training and financing from groups like the International Republican Institute, the National Democratic Institute and Freedom House\u201d and the State Department blithely admitted they had spent $50 million helping activists in the region network, communicate and organize with each other through Trojan horse NGOs like Movements.org.\n\nThe deception also worked in Syria, where leaked documents proved the US had been providing millions of dollars of support to opposition groups in the country since 2006 through a variety of Trojan horse NGOs like the Movement for Justice and Development.\n\nhttps://corbettreport.com/usaid-is-a-deep-state-trojan-horse/",
