Though to be coherent the rest of your sentence doesn't work either \"or fundamentally alter someone's body in a way that can\u2019t be undone\", as this also is the case for circumcision.\n\nAnother different aspect, childrens don't ask for circumcision.

Otherwise, it\u2019s pretty straightforward, kids aren\u2019t allowed to make permanent, life-altering decisions because they lack the long-term judgment to understand the consequences. That\u2019s why they can\u2019t sign contracts, get tattoos, drink, or even consent to medical procedures without parental approval.\n\nThe whole \"but the child wants it\" argument falls apart the second you apply it anywhere else. If a 12-year-old wanted a face tattoo, society wouldn\u2019t say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s their body, their choice.\u201d If they wanted to get sterilized at 14, no doctor would go along with it. But suddenly, when it comes to hormone therapy and irreversible surgeries, we're supposed to treat kids as if they have fully developed, rational decision-making? That\u2019s not consistency, it\u2019s people wanting an exception for something they\u2019re emotionally invested in and not wanting to deal with the fallout later.\n\nSo yeah, people want it to be a complex debate because that makes it easier to justify. But in reality, we already have the standard: kids don\u2019t get to make irreversible medical decisions. The fact that some people want to carve out an exception here says more about their priorities than the actual ethics of the situation.",

In 2019, each covered transgender person incurred an average of $1,776 in costs for gender-affirming hormone therapy and surgeries combined. Considered on a per-member basis across the entire commercially insured population in OLDW, the budget impact of gender-affirming care in 2019 was $0.73 per year, or $0.06 per member per month (PMPM).\n\nSo this is costing people, 6 pennies per policyholder.",
