One topic was how the dollar might be strengthened relative to other currencies, and along with something else i can't remember, may lead to large wage increases for Americans. It's complicated economics, but that's what mises.org is good at.",

Eventually these countries may catch on, but even then the tariff would generate some revenue while the recalcitrant nation decides whether it\u2019s worth the pain to endure or to modify whatever behavior trump wants modified. Generally the reversal of similar tariffs directed AT the USA or the removal of some similar protectionist policy affecting the USA currently.
