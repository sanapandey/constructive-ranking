He has done other shit I don't like and I find morally reproachable, like not lowering/burning Menem's portrait in the house of government, like he did with other Peronistas.   \nBut given that my alternative is 25% inflation per month, and an idiot who wants to nationalize all business. I'm gonna stay with Milei. Because again, I have WAY more problem with him not destroying Menem's portrait than taking advantage of some idiots who bought a crypto because someone else told them to.",

Anybody that buys crypto should know what they are getting themselves into. It's a highly speculative asset with lots of risks involved. He already said he is going to investigate everyone involved including himself. I think the left are just using it to bludgeon him with it because they got nothing else.",

This is how public company stock markets work every single day.\n\nAs someone with a huge social media presence, Milei had better learn that what he says has consequences like these. The bigger your social account, the fewer words you should ever say about any possible investment, BizOpp, public or private stock, or basically anything that stupid people can lose money on.
