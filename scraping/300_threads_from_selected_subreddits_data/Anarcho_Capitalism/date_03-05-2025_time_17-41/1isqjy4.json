At the end of the day who actually can, they\u2019re members of congress after all?\n\nThey\u2019re making tens of millions of dollars, the $5k fine is probably less than the brokerage fees on some of the trades. Not paying the $5k fine is just a symbolic act to show they\u2019re above the law. \n\nAny change is going to have to come from within, another member of the state in a position that has an established precedence of not being held to the law either.

Trump and a lot of Republicans in congress built this problem along with their Democrat colleagues.\n\n\nThe story Trump has spun before is that the deep state is doing this and the deep state works with the democrats.\n\n\nThe more Musk posts about things like FEMA being fraud.. well, no, congress specifically funded migrant housing. Or the limestone mines being ridiculous... again CONGRESS didnt fund the OPM's request to modernize. Less and less it seems the deep state is anything other than what Congress and the President tell it to be.\n\n\n\n\nWhich creates the question of whether this is a consolidation of power rather than a reduction of the state. Things like Musk not LEGALLY being in charge of DOGE raise transparency questions, and the fact that Congress is looking yo increase the deficit and increase our debt rather than address our debt issue raises question of actual real change. Add this on top of Trump demanding mineral rights from Ukraine and sending bombs to Gaza and it looks a lot like lip service.\n\n\nI'd love to see a lot of these efforts done in good faith, but there is some evidence they're not actually being done that way and deserve to have questions asked... something which is shut down quickly by MAGA types.",

Prior to working at NASA Michael Griffin worked for the CIA. He also traveled to Russia with Musk 6 years earlier around 2000. None of this is conspiracy or secret, Griffin's employment with In-Q-Tel, the COTS program, and Elon's biography are all public record.\n\n\nThis is all interesting because according to Musk he was in physical pain between 2005-2010 because Tesla and SpaceX were both going bakrupt. Several hundred million from a CIA asset probably helped.\n\n\nBut no, go on about Musk.\n\n\n>The most you could say is they're equally untrustworthy. But, Elon is a bit of a wild card. the IRS is a known violently criminal\u00a0organization.\u00a0\n\n\nDefense contractors are criminal. Go on about Musk\n\n\n>Elon at least has potential to be a little good. The IRS should get 18th century style severe punishment.\n\n\nI agree. And so should defense contractors with ties to the deep state.\n\n\nOh right... DoD contractors who got bailed out by CIA operatives aren't part of the deep state.\n\n\nAnd you can say \"See you hate billionaires!\", but no.. one billionaire who has been funded by the deep state for just about 19 years now and has very vested interest in the government is a bit suspicious.\u00a0\n\n\nHow does Elon's access help when they turn on the money printer and raise the debt ceiling? What purpose does increasing the number of government folks touching your data serve?\n\n\n\n\nEdit since he did block me:\n\n\nI never said the cuts themselves were bad, the point at the top comment is that we should view the people making them with suspicious and expect transparency. The ability to use these cuts as a distraction or a scapegoat exists. The fact some data leaks may have occured before is not a reason to throw confidential information hygiene out the window. There is a space between saying we shouldn't make cuts and saying we should just be happy until something bad happens, and suggesting people who may hope for the best but want to be prepared for the worst are NPCs or should be shut down only empowers the state to get away with deception if that's the goal. Saying it's insane to want transparency and accountability in a process allegedly about transparency and accountability is fucking twisted.",

Lmao.\n\n\nAnd yeah, I read what you've written, your knee jerk reaction was still to shut down discussion.\n\n\n\nYes, we should clear out the state, but that doesn't mean we should trust the government that it's objectively shrinking the power of the state. I gave several examples above about how reducing headcount doesn't remove the ability to create regulations but could just slow down approvals and lengthen service times for forced government interactions.\n\n\nI also gave the argument that there are transparency issues: all of a sudden Musk is not in charge of the department he was supposedly in charge of. This is the same department that wants access to all government databases potentially including ones with personal financial information of anyone who gets a tax return. Again: is it worth being a TINY bit suspicious of who is getting access to that?\n\n\nInstead of acknowledging that we shouldn't trust the government you shoot off into MAGA land \"Don't question the government\"\n\n\nIt's SUSPICIOUS when people who voted to not modernize a limestone mine retirement system suddenly thinking it needs to be updated. It's suspicious when people who voted to give FEMA money for migrants suddenly accuse FEMA of being frauds simply for following congress' bills.\n\n\n\n\n\"It isn't congress' fault for allocating money to FEMA for migrants, it's FEMA's fault.\"\n\n\n\"It isn't congress' fault for not giving OPM requested funds for modernizing, it's the OPM's fault.\"\n\n\nSo yes, it would be great if everyone suddenly had a change of heart and just cuts spending and government overreach. Hooray.\n\n\nBut it's less great if they're setting up a big scapegoat for additional wrong doing and scraping personal information while turning the money printer back on.\n\n\nAssuming you're just being a useful idiot right now for the MAGA folk: keep an eye out for yourself.",
