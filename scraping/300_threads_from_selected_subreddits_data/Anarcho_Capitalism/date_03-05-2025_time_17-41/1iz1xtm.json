There is no need for oppression, because there is no belief in private property (distinct from personal property) in a communist society. If you find this utopian and silly, fair enough.\n\nSocialism is when the workers own and democratically manage the business they work at.

And what is Anarcho-Capitalism?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSfiEniyUBY)\n\nWhat I can say, as a business owner, is that the dynamic in a small company like mine is very different from that of a publicly traded company. The biggest difference is in power dynamic. In a company owned by a few individuals, the owners have total power via their board appointments and hired management. However, in a publicly traded company there is downward shift of power to the often non-owning board and management/CEO. The owning \"masses\" become someone the CEO manages like other stakeholders. Sometimes going as far as criticizing the owners or making enemies out of them; (which pisses me off to no end when I hear about). In that sense I can kind of \"feel\" the argument a bit, because the CEO kind of becomes a bureaucrat more than the arm of the owners.",

Ancoms believe that property rights are government given rights because the ownership of land is hard to discern without a written deed or other such documentation. \n\nIn essence, the ancap will say, \"I am in possession of this thing, and thus I own it, and any infringement upon my ownership will be treated as a threat.\" Whereas an ancom would likely respond, \"If you leave that thing somewhere and someone happens upon it, who is to say you own it if the government does not exist?\"\n\nIn fairness to ancoms, this argument holds some weight. As we would all agree here, possession is the greatest indicator of ownership, so if I left my truck somewhere and someone took it, they possess it and in an ancap society where I didn't have a title for it, who is going to support me when I say that it is my truck and the person who currently possesses it stole it? And, if I defend my property as per the NAP, do the people around the thief believe that I was in the right to do it, or do they believe I wrongfully stole the thief's property and think I am in violation of the NAP?\n\nHowever, what ancoms fail to realize is that the ancap society as a whole relies on the NAP not as a means of reaction to aggression but as a deterrent to it. While it may be borderline naivety, the idea of the ancap society is that people will be brought into line through a mutual understanding of the NAP and what it means if you break it.\n\nI could point out the flaws in ancom ideology too, considering that their core tenant of \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\" fundamentally requires a power structure to enforce because it is against human nature. They are naive enough to believe that humans will always help each other out when they're in need and that it's just the government that has stopped that from happening (which is fair to a point, but not explicitly true.)",

The whole point is to eliminate the power imbalances that make 'might makes right' a necessity in capitalist frameworks.\n\n\nLet's talk more about anarcho-capitalist private property rights as this was the original subject of the post, no?\u00a0How do anarcho-capitalist private property rights even exist when, by definition, they require legal enforcement, and there\u2019s no government to provide that? What stops the private agencies handling enforcement from becoming mini quasi-governments with their own rules and power structures? And if protection is just another service you have to buy, doesn\u2019t that mean the wealthiest get to decide whose property actually matters? What\u2019s stopping anarcho-capitalism from devolving into corporate feudalism, where power, not rights, determines everything?\n\n\nLet\u2019s set aside the whataboutisms and actually put your philosophy under the microscope.",

The concept of 'community property' isn't about one individual imposing their will on others, but rather about collective management where resources are shared for the benefit of all. If someone wants to exclude others from using community property, it wouldn\u2019t be about a government forcing them to share, it would be about mutual agreements within the community, based on consensus and social norms.\n\n\nIn an anarchocommunist framework, conflict resolution comes from cooperation, not force. The idea is to create a society where everyone agrees to share responsibility and resources, so the need for violent force diminishes. Of course, that requires widespread consensus, but the point of this model is to create a system that reduces the need for force in the first place.\n\n\nNow, in an anarchocapitalist society, the situation is different because property is still individually owned, and there's no central authority to mediate disputes. What you're describing would just be a continuation of capitalist dynamics, where disputes over property and exclusion would likely be handled through private enforcement and essentially, more force, but distributed across private actors. This could easily devolve into a situation where the wealthiest individuals or corporations control the rules, creating more inequality and coercion.\n\n\nSo while you're right that in both societies conflicts would need to be resolved, the difference lies in the systems through which they would be resolved: one is focused on mutual cooperation and shared responsibility, and the other relies on competition and private enforcement, which can easily perpetuate the very power imbalances that anarchocapitalists claim to oppose.\n\n\nBut you've still not really addressed how private property works in anarchocapitalism, especially when there\u2019s no central authority to enforce it. How do we ensure that private enforcement agencies don\u2019t just become mini governments themselves, creating power structures and rules that end up resembling the state? What\u2019s to stop them from exploiting people, especially in a system where protection is a service you buy, meaning the wealthiest can essentially decide whose property matters? These are key issues that need more clarity\n\n\nDo these enforcement agencies have a monopoly on force? If not, what makes any ruling they issue binding when one side can simply refuse to comply and invalidate the decision entirely? If they do have a monopoly on force, why? That would make them no different from a government, especially if they establish overarching frameworks that all enforcement agencies must follow. In that case, it starts to sound a lot like consumer protection laws, which, again, essentially makes them a government.",

Private property absolutely requires a state or some governing authority because property rights are fundamentally laws that protect those claims. Without a state or authority to define and enforce these laws, there would be no formalized concept of private property. In a stateless society, like anarchocapitalism, the problem remains: who enforces property rights? Without a centralized authority, disputes about property would be resolved by competing private agencies, which would likely evolve into entities with coercive power, essentially becoming mini-governments themselves, contradicting the very idea of a stateless society.\n\n\n\n\nThe distinction between \"private\" and \"personal\" property is not arbitrary. Personal property is what you directly use for personal needs (clothes, tools, personal items) things that are tied to your personal well-being. Private property, however, refers to resources (land, buildings, etc.) that can be controlled, used to generate wealth, and excluded from others. This distinction is vital because it highlights different roles in the economy and the management of wealth. It's not just an artificial distinction set by a state or \u201cthe community.\u201d In anarchocapitalism, the line between personal and private property blurs when enforcement is outsourced to private companies. Likely creating exploitation and power imbalances where the wealthy can maintain control.\n\n\nAs for your point on exploitation: if you don\u2019t choose to do business with the wealthy, how can they exploit you? In an anarchocapitalist society, the wealthiest control the means of enforcement. Protection and services are bought, so they would have the resources to enforce their interests. This creates an environment where wealth, not merit or need, decides who has their rights respected. That is exploitation by default.\n\n\nThe \u201ccommunity decision-making\u201d critique you raise about anarcho-communism is flawed. It\u2019s not just about a majority deciding on something for their own gain. It\u2019s about creating a system that upholds fairness and the equitable distribution of resources. In a real community-based decision-making system, there\u2019s no inherent \"two wolves and a sheep\" problem because the community agrees on the needs of the many. It\u2019s about cooperation and collective benefit, not coercion or imposition.\n\n\nFinally, you mention that almost anything can be considered a \"means of production,\" but this isn't an argument against anarchocommunism. The point of ancom is not that everyone must produce the same way or that personal items are collectively owned, but that the means of production, resources that are necessary to produce wealth on a large scale are shared, not concentrated in the hands of a few. If someone tried to take someone's personal property, the community would have mechanisms for resolving that issue through mutual agreement, and not through force.\n\n\nIn both anarchocapitalism and anarchocommunism, hierarchies can form, but the key difference is that ancom actively seeks to reduce those power imbalances and structures, while ancap inevitably creates a system where wealth and coercion determine who has power. Both systems aim to reduce coercion, but ancom does so by emphasizing community and collective decision-making, while ancap does so in theory yet fails in practice when wealth and enforcement become the determining factors.\n\n\nBut again, instead of addressing the core questions being asked, you're sidestepping with \"whataboutisms\" or asking \"What does x really mean?\" It feels like you're putting more effort into avoiding the question than most ancaps put into explaining how their system truly works, outside of blind faith and the \"I'll just take my business elsewhere\" spiel. You're one person, but we already see in our current system that when a business is too convenient, people don\u2019t actually take their business elsewhere. So what makes it different in an ancap society? Actually, don't bother answering. At this point, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re not getting anywhere. Have a nice day, man.",

You\u2019re literally dodging with \u2018but what about x problem with ancom\u2019 instead of addressing the actual points I made. And now I\u2019m pissed. Reread my fucking answers, you dunce. I\u2019ve already addressed your whataboutisms, but you can\u2019t even answer two simple questions.\n\n\nSo I\u2019ll ask one last time: How does private property exist without an authority with a monopoly on force to protect it? How do private enforcement agencies not just become mini-governments?\n\n\nAnd before you try the same weak deflection again, no, ancom doesn\u2019t function like ancap. In ancom, enforcement of norms is decentralized and based on community consensus, not a market-driven service where the wealthy buy more \u2018protection.\u2019 Under ancap, security is literally a commodity. Meaning those with the most resources decide whose property gets defended. That\u2019s a power imbalance functionally identical to a state.\n\n\nMy brother in christ you\u2019re intentionally blurring the line between private and personal property. Personal property is what you directly use (your hands, your toothbrush, your house.) Private property is capital, land, and resources leveraged for profit. No one is saying the \u2018community\u2019 owns your hands that\u2019s a blatant strawman dipshit. The point is that the means of production, under ancom, are collectively managed so that no single person or corporation can monopolize access and exploit others.\n\n\nThe real cognitive dissonance here is pretending ancap somehow isn\u2019t just feudalism with extra steps.\n\n\nI won\u2019t respond unless your next answer actually addresses my questions. But honestly, at this point, I\u2019m reminded of that Mark Twain quote: \u2018Never argue with stupid people, they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience.'

And I believe I would be far better off doing that than relying on a government who confiscates my money and signs me up for their protection plan I never wanted. Likewise what good is my \u201cright\u201d to property if the government decides to use eminent domain against me ? \n\nI just think the world would be a better place if people stopped trying to use force against people they disagree with.",
