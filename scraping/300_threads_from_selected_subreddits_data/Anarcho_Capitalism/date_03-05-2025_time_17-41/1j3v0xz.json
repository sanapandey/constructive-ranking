    "selftext": "How exactly would ownership work? Would a ceo own everyone\u2019s land and dictate the rules because you are technically in their private city?\n\nHow would this be different from feudalism?\n\nHow would the owner of the ceo make money? I think making people pay to live there forcefully would just be taxes but i might be wrong.\n\nAre private cities more like hoa\u2019s and i just have the wrong idea?\n\nPlease i am not trying to attack anarcho capitalism in fact i believe i am turning into one (I\u2019ve considered myself a minarchist for probably almost a decade) I just genuinely have a lot of questions.\n\n\nNot sure why im being downvoted these are genuine questions ",

            "body": "The key difference between private cities and feudalism is contract. Under feudalism, people were born into a system where they owed obligations to a lord, often without consent. A private city, in contrast, operates on voluntary association\u2014if you don\u2019t like the rules, you can leave and take your business elsewhere.\n\nOwnership in a private city could take different forms. One model is that a company owns the land and sells or leases property, much like a real estate developer. Another model is a collection of private landowners forming a contractual association (like a Homeowners Association but voluntary). The rules of the city would be defined by contracts, not arbitrary decree.\n\nAs for making money, it\u2019s not through coercion (like taxation) but through service. Think of how shopping malls or Disney World operate\u2014people willingly pay for security, infrastructure, and amenities because they see value in them. If a private city\u2019s management is oppressive or inefficient, people will leave, and the project will fail.\n\nThe main takeaway: a private city isn\u2019t about a CEO owning everyone like a feudal lord, but about competing governance models offering the best services at the best price. If it doesn\u2019t work, it fails. Unlike the state, which forces you to pay up no matter how badly it functions.\n\nHope that helps!",

It Is much hard, and sometimes neigh impossible for State run organizations to fail - regardless of how terrible they are run.",
