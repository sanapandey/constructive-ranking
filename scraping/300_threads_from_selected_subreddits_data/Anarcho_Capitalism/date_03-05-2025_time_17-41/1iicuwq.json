But 30 days notice for USAID staff to pack their shit and leave is too fucking far, at least for staffers with kids and/or those that have been living on assignment abroad for years. It's going to piss off a lot of them, some of which either hold the keys to some important shit or are friends with the people that do.\n\nGut the chaff agencies, but don't fuck over the people that have kept the lights on.\n\n",
