For example,  if you mine 3 kilos of coal and sell them for 30 bucks, you get paid 30 bucks (obviously this wouldn't happen bcs you'd also have to pay for running the mine and for the equipment along with your coworkers,  but that's the main idea)\n\nLenin theorised that since the government works for the people and they get to vote who represents them, the means of production are controlled by the people through the government.  Lenin then died and Stalin centralised a lot of power into his position. Either way, comand economy means that the government owns the factories and gets to decide what they make and how they operate\n\nThis is a very rudimentary explanation and I don't expect anyone here to agree with me or change their mind, I wrote this solely cuz I was bored.",

It's quite viable in stable industries with consistent demand and which don't require large influxes of external capital.  \n\n\nIt would be very difficult for entrepreneurship to take place, or for new and untested ideas to be tried in the market, if employee ownership were the *only* option.
