    "selftext": "There are many reasons we shouldn't care about morality too much if we want a better world. \n\n\nThe more we count on the more things are likely to fail. \n\nThe irony of morality is it makes us blame others and in the process we actually see or should see the problem in our system. If people need to be moral for our plan to work then chance is, it doesn't work. \n\nInstead, a good system should be like bitcoin. It doesn't require us to trust any one and somehow it just works. \n\nWhat will definitely don't work is a plan that will work only if all people are moral. Imagine a system where immoral employee can steal. The one getting rich is the immoral ones and soon words spread out and everybody is immoral. Allowing immoral people to cheat us is immoral itself. It's called being unfair\n\nAncaps require elimination of government. \n\nProspera requires special license and good graces of voters. \n\nLibertarians require people to agree to libertarianism. \n\nI think a system that ONLY requires countries not to fight one another is fine. Wesphalian principles is doing great at making our world prosper. \n\nOf course, non libertarians require even more unreasonable condition for things to work. \n\nWhile capitalism requires only people are selfish, greedy but don't hurt each other, communism requires people to be dilligent for the sake of others. That's just too unrealistic. \n\nEven pure capitalism isn't too realistic. Humans simply don't stop their greed when they violate rights of others. They just use force and fraud and justify it. \n\nFortunately non perfect capitalism do fine. \n\nMorality is subjective. What I think is moral is immoral for others. To me drugs should be legal and tax should be low. \n\nTo government it's the other way around. Instead I should recognize that government is stronger and pay taxes. There are many ways to greatly reduce tax legally. \n\nDemocracy allows us to change government peacefully. Federalism allows us to shop around for government. Moldbug principles give proper incentives for shareholders to make population happy. Combining all those will get us something good. \n\nAll those are good enough. ",

Computer/cloud systems built by the smartest people over years and decades still get hacked regularly via social engineering. Online games illustrate the effect of destabilization when too many people use exploits (a loophole in an otherwise well designed system)\n\nThis has nothing to do with my personal morality. Even old-timey pirates and modern hackers have moral codes. Multiple research studies have been done on the topic. Think of morality as a designed system for stable human behavior.",

That system is designed so that no small group of people's malicious intents can feasibly put the system in a bad state, i.e. the power (or human element) is decentralized.\n\nSystems that can be predictably be hacked or exploited by a small group of people also are not good systems.\n\n> Think of morality as a designed system for stable human behavior.\n\nHow?

If a contract is 100% ironclad, then human element and/or morality are eliminated. But what makes a contract ironclad? How are ambiguity and exceptions handled? \n\n>How?  Morality is certainly not a primary mechanism for whatever stability society has now.  \n\nIt is not a primary but important factor.

Morality is a best something politicians and religious people invoke to push their agendas.\n\nEverything can be corrupted. Ironically, people lacking morals are the ones abusing them. I think the issue in this discussion is the focus on the negative connotation of morality. Instead, think of business focused morality as \"I presume you are interested in making a mutually beneficial deal\" vs \"I presume you will rob me blind unless I rob you first\".",

Transferring bitcoin does not put the system at risk regardless of the reason of the transfer.\n\n> Lack of morality devolves into \"might makes right\"\n\nNot if a system is in place that disincentivizes that behavior.

It just the acceptance that morality is a flimsy thing.\n\nA system that does not require moral people (whatever that means) is a better system that does require such people.  It is better to find people will common preferences and collaborate with them than to impose your will justifying it with morality... since you would be tacitly consenting to others doing the same to you.",

Especially since you automatically add \"imposing and justifying\". You are advocating to find people with similar morals. That means you understand the value of morality within business.\n\n>Not if a system is in place that disincentivizes that behavior.\n\nCommunism (**gasp**) had a system of incentives and disincentives for proper behavior. Moreover, every country has laws and subsidies to adjust behavior.

If a thief gains access to a bitcoin and steals it, then that bitcoin throughout its life flows through inappropriate channels. You can replace theft with a fraudulent contract to have the same effect.",

Anyone can write down an objective set of procedures to resolve conflicts.  So, in that sense we do have many objective standards.\n\nFor example, I like the non aggression principle.  But most self-proclaimed ancaps do not recognize that by itself the NAP implies almost nothing.  You must presuppose norms regarding property rights, justice, aggression, etc before the NAP becomes applicable.  The devil is in the details.  In reality, consent is a better focus for ancaps, but consent is messy becomes it lies at the .intersection of philosophy, psychology, and law.  Consent is culturally relative, and in the end I think it's best if people accept the short comings of political philosophy so its strengths can be properly utilized.\n\nYou can see what I mean if you read just the first part of the book of Rothbard's For a New Liberty (but as a socialist).  A socialist would confirm their biases with the concept of natural precisely the same way many natural law ancaps do.
