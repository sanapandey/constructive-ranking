But you have to ask yourself at what cost, Ukraine already fought in the past when they where under USSR to get their independence, they already gave away they nukes in trade for US, UK and Russian security assurance. And now 20 - 30 years later they are at it again still fighting for their indepence, now they have fought for 3 years, somewhat successful since putins plan was to take over ukraine in 3 weeks. They have now lost about 20% of their land, US demand a big part of their resources in trade for security from Russia. And the worst part, are that Trump hasnt discussed security yet, what will US do if Russia invades, trump as far as I know has not provided any formal obligations so far. So understandably ukraine is very worried, because unlike Trump, Ukraine dont trust Russia, and sees their word as meaningless. If russian words meant anything, the budapest memorandum with still hold, so their signature as far as zelensky sees it is worthless. What they need are backing from allies to escalate incase Russia decides to continue, and it needs to be from trusthworthy allies. I would also argue UK and US on some level also failed ukraine in 2014 when they didnt intervene when ukraine sovereignty was breached by russia, they should have escalated as they where justified in doing so, the budapest memorandum is clear on this.",
