The same thing as Progressives who infiltrate the church, stifle what it\u2019s actually about, and wear it like a skin suit to make the entire religion about LGBT rainbow dogshit. You\u2019re here to subvert and make Libertarianism about championing leftist social dogma.",

There is no way a party of individualists can effectively represent every member. There is no way every member will abide a party which they see as being wrong on some questions and therefore wrong on everything.\n\nIt is similar to the gatekeeping even seen on this sub. The no true Scotsman gatekeeping here is at work within the party also.\n\nMeanwhile, I would suggest the libertarian movement has advanced around the nation. For example, it was at the election booth that every state that has legalized cannabis has ended its prohibition in those states. I say that is a libertarian ideal that has the support of most people in the nation.\n\nThe libertarian movement may not be very compatible with normal political party customs and what is necessary to maintain a party. But some of the ideals of the movement continue to be accepted by the public.\n\nI would suggest that until the LP can become a viable political party, the libertarian movement concentrate on working with the Ds and Rs to form issue based coalitions to push forward with the passage of libertarian ideals on those issues.",

As long as that's the case, the way you get things done is working through one of the existing parties. \n\nEven Ron Paul worked through the Republican party, not the LP. Trump himself was not a Republican. He explored a third-party run in 2000; eventually he decided to take over the Republican party instead.",

They back tracked on issues that alienated thousands \u2014 if not millions of established or potential libertarians from the party platform.\n\nI understand they wanted to bring the LP to the forefront by selling out to Trump and his lackeys, but the issue is that Trump is a corporatist at heart, his platform is reminiscent of the 80s-90s DNC. He extended our stay in the Middle East ordering more drone strikes in Syria (like Obama), continued the detention centers established by his predecessor.\n\nThe arguments I see for support of the MC is that they brokered a deal with the Trump administration during their campaign to free Ross if the MC can convince libertarians to vote for Trump. The plan worked, but now we are seeing the after effects, because most of Trump\u2019s platform is extremely anti-libertarian and much closer to authoritarian rule. When it comes to elections there is no \"lesser evil,\" it is just evil vs. evil.\n\nChase Oliver was elected to be the president-select for the party because of how poorly the MC has treated the party\u2019s message and the liberty movement. Slipping through the cracks of the Mises Cacus rule is conservatives pushing for more government control under the Trump administration, some even proposing racist theories such as the \"great replacement.\" To top it all off they contribute to posting culture war nonsense and continuously post homophobic and transphobic rhetoric, trying to pass it off as what libertarians believe when it\u2019s not even true.\n\nMises Cacus is playing a dangerous game that is resulting in the reputation of the liberty movement to be tarnished, giving democrats and republicans fuel against it.",
