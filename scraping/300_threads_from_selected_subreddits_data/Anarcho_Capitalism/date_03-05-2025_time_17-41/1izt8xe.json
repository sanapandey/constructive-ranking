But the know it all in me finds it irresistible to talk about stuff I know about, so I'm gonna say it anyways, ACSHUALLY, that's a misconception, the Wild West, was actually way more tame than the romanticism of Hollywood makes it look. Actual murders were rare and gun confrontations even more so. This is not to say there wasn't crime or murder, there was and a lot, but it was usually isolated. The ones at most risk of dying in the wild west were the natives, and it calmed down pretty early. For example, by 1880, there were even less murder in several cities of the Wild West, like Abilene, Caldwell, Dodge City, Ellsworth and Wichita, than in New York, Boston or Baltimore.",

They turn away from uncomfortable truths, refusing to acknowledge them;even as democracy fractures before their eyes. The systems in place do not exist to serve the people but to subjugate them, consolidating power in the hands of those who seized it through force rather than merit. This is the harsh reality most would rather ignore, and it is precisely this denial that keeps these failing systems on life support. I highly recommend watching the documentary *HyperNormalisation*.",
