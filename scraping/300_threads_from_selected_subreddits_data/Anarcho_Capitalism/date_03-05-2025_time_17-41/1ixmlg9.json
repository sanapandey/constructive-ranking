    "selftext": "Nature. Anarchy is the forest. The sea. The woods, the mountains. Following nature. Natural law is the only real law. In my view cities are places where people go to disconnect from nature. It seems to me they are the strong hold for these disempowering ideas about top down control. I long for small towns and villages living in natural law instead of paper law.",

We are disconnected from the laws of nature because most of us believe that the state is a natural extension of the methods we have always used to deal with parasites, while actually being parasitic itself. \n\nBut i'm not sure that big cities create it. Graeber and Wengrow in \"Dawn of Everything\" showed evidence of very large groups of people operating with seemingly no coercion. Something else must have gone amok. We somehow got fooled into forgetting that freedoms tops everything.",

People in cities rely on government-managed services (water, power, roads, transit), making them dependent. Zoning laws and regulations limit freedom, while higher taxes and business restrictions tighten economic control. Surveillance and policing are everywhere, ensuring compliance. Cities also concentrate cultural institutions (media, universities) that shape public perception and reinforce state legitimacy. Plus, urban life reduces self-sufficiency, you're less likely to grow your own food or build without permits. All of this makes cities perfect for top-down control.",

Theres also zoning laws everywhere in America, so none of these are specific to cities. What do you mean cities concentrate cultural institutions like universities? Like they are geographically close together? Idk if colleges being physically close together reinforces state legitimacy. You cant build without permits legally anywhere in America once again not dpecific to cities.",

Rural areas might have zoning laws, but enforcement is weaker, and people often bypass restrictions (think off-grid living, home businesses, or private roads). Cities, on the other hand, have constant enforcement, permits, inspections, and red tape at every turn.\n\nAs for cultural institutions, it's not just about proximity. Cities are where major universities, media hubs, and corporate headquarters cluster, shaping public narratives. They influence what people consider \"normal\" and acceptable, often reinforcing the idea that government intervention is necessary. That level of concentrated ideological influence is much weaker in rural areas, where local culture and self-reliance play a bigger role.\n\nCities don\u2019t create government control, but they maximize it.",

If anything, being distributed in small groups makes defeat or control in detail easier as they can focus more manpower at smaller concentrations of population to do whatever they want. It might make guerilla warfare to resist easier bit I don't think it really cancels out. It's really not like one is inherently better than the other. Besides the whole premise of AnCap is free trade between individuals which is enhanced by markets. Markets arrise from increased population centers. Or at least scale with it.\u00a0\u00a0",

Whether it will be Venice, France, Poland or Rome all of those states rose because of their nobility. Under extreme, uncontrolled capitalism, nobility and chivalry cannot exist, and so neither can culture, and so neither can society. Anarchy is absurd, because things must be predictable and stable, while it is random, greatly influenced by the ever-changing market. While change isn't bad, chaos, rapid change and progress for the sake of progress are horrible.",
