He founded La Libertad Avanza (\"Liberty Advances\") in 2021 and won the presidential election in 2023.",

That's how he grew to, as Rothbard would put it, \"hate the state\" and despise the parasite class that runs the state.\n\nMeanwhile, in the USA we're stuck with an economic ignoramus who thinks tariffs and trade wars are good actually, and doesn't see an economic downside to deporting a sizable chunk of the workforce.",
