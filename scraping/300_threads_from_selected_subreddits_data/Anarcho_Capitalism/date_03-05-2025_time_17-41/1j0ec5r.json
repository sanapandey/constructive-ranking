            "body": "I don't think LGBT characters are being protested only for being LGBT. I think the problem is the same as protesting ugly and/or masculinized female characters, race swapped characters, and overrepresented minority characters - because it appears to be political.\n\nPeople generally want attractive heroes and heroines. Not always, and sometimes an unattractive or average hero works perfectly for the story, but we all know that Hollywood and in gaming, many studios are purposely doing this sort of thing when it makes little to no sense for the story.\n\nFor example, nobody minds Sigourney Weaver as a strong female character in the Alien franchise. In fact, many people see her Ripley character as being a fantastic iteration of what a strong female character should be. She isn't some hulking 6'5\" body builder or some super master fighter who can take down men of that size with her bare hands in a 5'5\" 135lb frame. Her character is maternal. She survives and saves others because of her insight, her intelligence, and her **courage**.\n\nThen you have race swapped characters that are beloved, like Nick Fury played by Samuel L. Jackson, who does a fantastic job at the role and you never once get the sense that they did that for political reasons, or just to have a set amount of representation in the films he's in. Nobody minds these things when they're done outside of political reasons.\n\nThe thing is lately we're seeing what is blatantly not something the industry would have ever done before. This has created tropes like the \"girl boss\" - just another Mary Sue character who is just overall better than her male counterparts in every conceivable way, often accompanied by actual male characters who are made to appear stupid and incompetent. Princess Leia is another great example of a good strong female character. She was competent, but so was Luke, Han, Lando, etc. In contrast, look at her younger character in the Obi Wan series who was made out to be more competent than a former Jedi Master who had the wisdom to fight wars on a galactic scale. It's sheer nonsense and turns audiences against the entire premise.\n\nFor me and many others, all we want to stop is the political posturing. If the story is all about a barbershop and community in the south side of Chicago (like the movie, Barbershop), then it would be just as annoying to see too many white people. Have you seen the Willow show that was quickly cancelled? Where the captain of the military of an entire kingdom who's a veteran soldier of countless battles dies to a single arrow in the first skirmish of the show but the lesbian teenager is so amazing that she can almost single-handedly fight off all of the assailants without coming up with so much as a scratch? It's just ridiculous and unbelievable, so what you come out with is a show that seems so out of touch with reality that you can't immerse yourself in it. It seems phony and fake, and when you try to put your finger on why it feels that way and start to actually pay attention to the things going on in the show, you're quick to realize that it's because of these same-old modern-day silliness.\n\nNobody is upset if a character is LGBT, but let's say you suddenly have a trans knight in a movie set in the middle ages. This is basically ridiculous because the notion that someone who felt \"trans\" at such a time would NEVER project that out into the world, and the number of people who even feel trans are so small compared to the global population that to have a story where like 4 of the main characters are LGBT set in such a setting is such an overreach of realistic that it makes the entire production feel like big political push instead of trying to tell a good, realistic story you can get lost in.\n\nTake Kevin Costner's Robin Hood. His companion was played by Morgan Freeman, who was a fantastic character who fit the theme and time, but he was also a RARITY. If you see 40% black people walking around town in a setting in the middle ages, that's politics. There aren't 40% blacks in Europe today, let alone then.\n\nThen you get today where a \"queer\" black woman is cast to play Jesus Christ in a remake of Jesus Christ Superstar. Why? Why not an Asian woman? Why not a white woman? Why not what he historically would have been? A middle eastern Jewish man?\n\nBecause politics, I'm sure.",

I never hear this in almost any conversations in the real world that aren't literally a conversation that's ABOUT religion, and since religion is such a controversial topic for so many people, that rarely if ever happens because it usually causes strife.\n\nLike, I'm an atheist. The only thing you're going to hear from me in a conversation about ANY religion is that gods aren't real and the supernatural doesn't exist. Religious people don't want to hear how you think their worldview is nonsense.",

Someone talking to an invisible sky daddy like a delusional person?\n\nAnd for religion in conversations, it happens A LOT. I would agree with you when I lived in large cities, it was very rare, but in a deep christian town now, it is spoken all the time. You can't have a 15 min conversation without God somehow being involved. \n\n  \nMe: \"Can you believe they didn't' pass the funding to add a security fence to our school?\"  \nThem: \"I can't either, but I'm sure God will figure out a way to protect our children\"",

I think the problem is when someone is inauthentically putting it into the story.\n\nFor example, if I were to put a gay character kissing a person of the same-sex in a movie, it would be without any politics, and only because I want it in the story without bias. Same would go for if the opening of my movie contains a religious person praying - I'm an atheist, I have no stake in that sort of thing.\n\nBut when someone believes in say, leftist ideology, such as perhaps LGBT positive rights, and then that person is in charge of a movie and places LGBT characters in where they don't seem to belong, or overuses LGBT characters when in the real world there aren't even that many people who are LGBT, the problem there becomes that you just know it's due to politics and ideology.",
