There are natural law and consequentialist ways to justify these negative rights.\n\nPositive rights such as health care, food, shelter, etc, though desirable, can't be guaranteed without violating others' negative rights. Anarcho-capitalist libertarians contend that protecting negative rights leads to these things being widely attainable in society.\n\nAll of those specific things have been thoroughly discussed, written about, and argued about.",

There would likely be some element of animal cruelty, just as there currently is now. \n\nGiven its extreme unpopularity, individuals inclined to treat animals cruelty would likely be disincentivized to do so by people excluding them from society and refusing to associate with them, serve them and their establishments, and boycott their businesses. The more unpopular society holds animal cruelty, the more effective this will be and vice versa. As with right now, a society that doesn't highly value animals will unfortunately have more animal abuse than otherwise. \n\nThat's probably a limited and incomplete response, but it's the first thing that pops into my head.",

There are states where fighting animals against each other for sport is legal and states where animal cruelty isn't prosecuted.  Before you claim that moving to another state is inconvenient, moving would also be inconvenient in a libertarian society.  Animal cruelty is increasingly recognized as psychopathic, antisocial behavior.  It's not entirely easy to just happen upon a bunch of properties near each other where animal abusers could move to form their own society.  Even if people are inclined to be cruel to animals, I doubt many are motivated by it so much as to make a major life decision like that based on it.\n\n> I don't think disincentives will work. We're already seeing shunning happen between groups online and it's not changing people's behavior, just making things awful.\n\nShunning people online is nowhere near as effective.  People online can find people anywhere in the world to interact with all the same.  Even more importantly, suffering impaired interaction and business with those around you is much more of a detriment than being ignored by people you don't want to talk to on the internet.\n\n> There's so many people, you can always find some folks who want to do harm. \n\nTrue.  Any society, anarchist or not, will suffer more cruelty with a more cruel population.  That happens now as well.  There's a tendency to criticize anarcho-capitalism based on what *could* happen rather than what is *likely* to happen.  All kinds of terrible things could and do happen now in our current world as well.  Specifically, you can find some places in our current world where animal cruelty is accepted unfortunately.  If you're going to criticize that there will be pockets of people in an anarchist world where people are cruel to dogs with nobody stopping them, how is that any different than today's world?  Are you doing anything to go stop animal cruelty where it happens in places you don't live?",

Which really doesn't distinguish it from any other social structure, but at least the rule of law *tried*. I don't think anyone who is advocating for this has ever lived in a society in which *nobody* was able to try to make things better.

If the society leans more \u201cby the book\u201d then you\u2019d expect limits on treatment of the dog to be spelled out in an adoption contract. You see some of that already now, with shelters making you agree to certain conditions before you can get a dog. Same in ancapistan, but on a larger scale. If you treat the dog in a way that breaks the contract, the shelter can bring a civil suit as described in the contract. The reputation of a shelter would suffer if they offered contracts out of step with society at large, or if they were known not to enforce their contracts in the face of abuse. \n\nFor areas that aren\u2019t as formal, you could expect a much more ad-hoc flavor of ancapistan. Your neighbor sees you beat your dog, and later carries out a rescue. You later climb to the top of the fence and get pictures of your dog in his yard. You file a suit to recover your dog plus expenses. He shows up to court and provides a video of you beating the dog. The jury sides with him, awarding him ownership of the dog plus legal expenses.\n\nAnnoyed, you refuse to pay them. A lien is placed on your house by the mortgage holder, who recognizes the validity of the court you chose. As you dig in, more and more vendors stop dealing with you, and eventually, you leave the town in disgust, a pariah for your actions, heading to the promised statist refuge of the People\u2019s Democratic Republic of Quebec.",

Not all Austrian economists are ancaps, the OGs were more like minarchists, but the two schools of thought generally run pretty close together.",
