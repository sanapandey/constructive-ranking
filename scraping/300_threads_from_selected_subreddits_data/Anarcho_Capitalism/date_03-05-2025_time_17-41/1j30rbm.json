The US nuclear deterrent is essential to the survival of the US and our allies. If anything we need to be modernizing and expanding our nuclear arsenal. Someone who is no threat today could be an enemy tomorrow.                                 Our nuclear arsenal is very much like the individual citizens that are armed to the teeth in preparation for anything; our military needs to be ready for anything. If anything expanding and modernization of our nuclear arsenal could very well allow us to cut down on conventional forces and shut down some of our overseas bases. Why would we need so many bases overseas when we could have a nuclear submarine armed with SLBMs patrolling off the coast of the same country?       Eisenhower did this during his administration and was able to cut the military budget because at the time nuclear weapons were cheaper to build and maintain than a massive conventional force of troops and tanks etc.       I don\u2019t want war with Russia, China or North Korea or Iran at all, that is the last thing I want or the world needs but I don\u2019t think we can trust them especially China and North Korea. Now is not the time to be reducing our nuclear arsenal, it is simply far too dangerous a time to do so. I also think that South Korea and Japan should build their own nuclear arsenal to help strengthen the nuclear umbrella that the US provides both countries. SK having a nuclear arsenal gives NK pause in doing something stupid and Japan having a nuclear deterrent gives NK and China time to think long and hard about what they are going to do. Are they going to start some shit or are they going to want to decide what to do peacefully?",
