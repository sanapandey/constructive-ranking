I don't see how that is a no true scotsman fallacy. In fact it seems that the only person who would say it was would be an anti-libertarian (specifically an anti-anarcho-capitalist). I'll assume that you're pro-libertarian and say that I think you're misusing the term.",

I'm sure there are some who fit that description, but I have a never talked to one of them online. The only Argentinian Milei supporters I've talked to do seem to understand, and the fact that his popularity increased even as the economic situation got worse in the early days of his term. It was as if the people knew that things would get worse before they got better. Populists would have turned on a dime and abandon him the moment things didn't magically improve.\n\nAlso, speaking of things not magically improving, I would remind Hoppe that Milei is not an absolute ruler. He may have a little more power than the US president, but he cannot simply abolish the government with a decree.",

And what he would do is a terrible idea anyway: closing the central bank without rescuing the pesos and without dollars in the market would be an economic and political disaster. Milei would have been impeached in less than one month in office, and libertarianism would be forever labeled as something for crazy people. It would destroy any chance of any libertarian ideas to spread for the next 100 years.\n\nAnd to complement, let's admit Hoppe is not a great theorist either. If he understood it correctly, his ethical theory is just him recreating Kant's categorial imperative and Kant\u2019s law. His anarcho-capitalist theories are also just the old principle of secession that's been around since John Locke. The only reason he thinks he's presenting something new is ignorance.",

Those were trading pennies to the dollar, with most thinking it would never be repaid. It was repaid. As a result, the credibility of USA shot through the roof. And the rest is history.",
