Apparently people think only the state is capable of organizing and funding a decent military even though they are incompetent and inefficient in all matters. Whatever the state can do, anarchy can do better. Plenty of people care to protect themselves from foreign threats, why should they be any less willing to fund a private military than they are other private replacements for government? Silly.",

Power vacuums draw the shittiest of people that want the power.\n\nPeople will always organize and defer authority to someone else. It's in our nature and has been drilled into society for the past 2000 years.\n\nI would love no one telling me what to do, I fucking hate authority. I would love to \"not pay taxes\" but I also understand the necessity in modern society. Times were different 200 years ago where the only real infrastructure was fucking ditches to dump your shit in. Of course that doesnt take any money to upkeep.\n\nWe have 8 times the population now. We have 1000 times the technology and infrastructure. We have electricity and running water and sewers and streets and traffic systems. We have things like snow removal and public transit. This is all mostly shit we didnt have 100 years ago even, with 8 times the amount of people using all this stuff.\n\n\nThe people who claim there's no use for government are just lying. It's basically the equivalent of saying there's no benefits to any sort of central management, which is basically idiotic. You can definitely argue against government, and sure there's tons of waste and abuses. But let me tell you this....\n\nThe difference between a mediocre government and a fucking shitty one are light years away and frankly incomparable.\n\nAt the end of the day, I live in a place with high taxes, but for the most part, everything works and I don't even notice a government most days. Government has changed ... what... 15 times over my life? And I've barely noticed any difference at all in 40+ years.\n\nThat's about the best case scenario I can hope for.\n\nTaxes suck, but I believe the alternative and living with a truly shitty government would be much much worse.",
