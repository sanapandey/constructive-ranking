But we basically agree. It's a bullshit way to describe things unless they're taking the government out of it entirely and allowing a market to fully form in that area.",

Trump has literally said at one point that he's in favor of the death penalty for drug dealers, and has praised China and Singapore for their harsh drug laws.\n\nHe threatened to shut down TV broadcasters that are critical of him and threatened to imprison Mark Zuckerberg for life. He's bringing religious fanatics into government, and has set up a new official White House Faith Office that will be led by a religious extremists who said \"to say no to Trump is to say no to God\", and who will use government funds to spread religious fundamentalism.\n\nHe's threatened to charge teachers with sex crimes for using student's prefered pronouns, which regardless of what you think of trans stuff is extreme government overreach.\n\nAnd he wants to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which is the same law used to Japanese internment camps during WW2, and in theory would allow him to imprison legal and law-abiding immigrants for no reason other than their nationality.\n\nHe also wants to set up a federal sovereign wealth fund and has said he may want to use that so that the federal government can buy TikTok. And he wants to use tax payer money to turn Gaza into a US-owned real estate complex.\n\nAnd he's anti free trade and is constantly threatening to impose tariffs, which will be paid for by American companies.\n\nIn what world is Trump, the guy who most of you ancaps worship, a small government guy??",

And even then, it's unpredictable what he'll follow up with. I'm pretty sure he's already forgotten about Greenland and Panama.\n\nFurthermore, I could see him using all these random outbursts as distractions. While everybody's upset about the inane comments about Gaza, he has moved on to defund the Department of Education, or something else.\n\nIt's no longer about the marketing strategy of \"staying on message\". Rather, it's keep everybody's attention. But not on a particular topic, just on him. While something else is happening in the background. This is the same strategy MSM has used for decades.
