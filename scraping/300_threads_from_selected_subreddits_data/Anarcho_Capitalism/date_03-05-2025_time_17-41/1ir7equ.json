    "selftext": "Things should be like bitcoin. It should works whether people are moral or immoral.\n\nHow do we get countries not to attack one another? We already did. How do we create bitcoin? Someone already did.\n\nSo it's already working out. Hell, humanity 300 times GDP growth shows that even imperfect capitalism works. Let's just work what we have.\n\nThen what?\n\nBitcoin is hard to tax and hard to seize. So governments are having a hard time taxing income. Governments can't be too nozy anymore.\n\nCrypto bro is richer and richer. They not only can just move somewhere more free they can also influence governments. Elon did a lot to destroy DEI.\n\nThen what?\n\nIf you want something totally peaceful to whoever is in power, you can try expevolu\n\n[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SnqHwiYAQuerCoBek/expevolu-a-laissez-faire-approach-to-country-creation](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SnqHwiYAQuerCoBek/expevolu-a-laissez-faire-approach-to-country-creation)\n\nLet me simplify.\n\nCreate private cities. \n\nShare profit to all voters.\n\nA bit like Prospera. Instead of sharing profit to Honduras government, Prospera can share profit to all Honduras voters' straight.\n\nShare to Honduras government means sharing to Honduras leftist politicians that will just pocket the money and slander Prospera. That's the very problem Prospera wanna do right?\n\nVoters got cash for choosing better strategies, namely allowing something like Prospera to exist.\n\nWant more money?\n\nAllow more private cities.\n\nNetwork of private cities have most benefit of ancapnistan.\n\nThat's it.\n\nNobody, well, at least not too many people have to be too moral.\n\nEveryone just want money. Tada...\n\nWhy countries need not to attack one another? Actually, not even that is necessary. To the opposite, conflict regions will be the best place this idea can be implemented. Yea, we want peaceful evolution toward capitalism. Not exactly that necessary. I think this idea can at least make things better in Israel or Ukraine?\n\nJust create private cities managed by people that's friendly for both sides. Those in power have shares. They can negotiate. Let whoever want to live there and best at making money stay.",

The ownership of a large stone, which would be too difficult to move, was established by its history as recorded in oral tradition rather than by its location. Appending a transfer to the oral history of the stone thus effected a change of ownership.[3]\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Some modern economists have viewed Rai stones as a form of money, and the stones are often used as a demonstration of the fact that the value of some forms of money can be assigned purely through a shared belief in said value.[3][8]",

I used it in my business to accept payments world wide, and I am using it on daily basis to trade with people. For very small amount like groceries, it can be definitely tricky as confirmation times are long, but for anything like amazon you can just trade BTC for amazon gift-cards, I did this for big amounts. For bigger amounts, it is even better than USD, want to buy a house? You can pay with BTC, want to buy a sports car, you can pay with BTC. All you have to do is agree with the person selling it, whole transaction is done under 15 minutes. Voluntary exchange between two individuals is the cornerstone of ancap, and BTC gives you ability to just do that. No more banks asking you where you are sending your money or freezing your accounts, or government tracking your money (monero has a lot more resistance against that, I must admit, but you can still use BTC anonymously if you don't buy it for FIAT with KYC).",
