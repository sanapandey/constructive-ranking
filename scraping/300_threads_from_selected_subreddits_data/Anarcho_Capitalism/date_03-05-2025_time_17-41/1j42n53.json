The government tried to bring western businessmen and open the country to investments.\n\nThe narrative spewed by anti-western movements have appealed to a dirty nationalism exactly as above. \"They are stealing our wealth. We are selling our country.\" Basically.\n\nBut just looking at who owns the factory and if it's not ours they are stealing our wealth is not enough. Like wtf.\n\nIf they bring in money and investments, if they pay their workers, then the local economy benefits 100%.\n\nAlternatively, if no investment is made in the local community, then guess what, yes, they are stealing our wealth. \n\nMy point is, as long as local labour is used, it's a good thing for the country.",
