If not, company management can just pay themselves even greater amounts, offsetting all profit, or make deals that benifit their family and friends but not the company.  \n\nThe Dodge Brothers sued Ford over this and that finding became case law.  In theory, market forces would work this out to a happy medium, but many incestors don't have the luxury to diversify and be patient.",

Very, very specific industries may have a law now, but where they exist, they are relatively new, and mostly legally untested. \n\nThe concept instead refers to precedent in common law. Basically always, it is a concept described in conjunction with another crime. IE, you have a duty to use the corporate assets for corporate stuff, not to pilfer into your own pocket. So, it'll come up when describing embezzlement or the like. \n\nObviously, theft is wrong, and stealing from shareholders or defrauding them is a NAP violation. The concept that one should avoid that is reasonable and pretty obvious. \n\nFiduciary duty does NOT mean that a CEO is constrained to only do one thing. There are many, many potential strategies that have a reasonable honest business approach, and selecting strategies is the business of, well, business. Not judges.",
