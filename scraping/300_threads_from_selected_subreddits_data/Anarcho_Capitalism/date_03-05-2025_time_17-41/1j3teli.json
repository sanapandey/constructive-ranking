I can still quit with no repercussions until I ship to basic training in the summer. If I don't go I have 3 years of college paid for already. I also promised myself that if I joined I would refuse to violate the NAP and would refuse to go anywhere where I would likely require the use of even defensive violence.",

The entire job of being in the state-owned military is a violation of the Non-Aggression Principle. Your salary and all the equipment you use is funded through theft. I see little justification from an ethical libertarian perspective. \n\nWith that being said, we have to work with what we have. Obviously, using tax-payer funded services is inevitable in our society. If AnCapistan is to exist, it's a long way from now. Worrying about it too much could be unnecessarily exhausting. I'd be very cautious with the military, though. I probably wouldn't join.",

What separates business from the government is the fact that business is voluntarily funded, meaning they have competition and can go out of business. For a voluntarily funded military, all that applies and other private military providers can compete, putting the original one out of business. However, a government is a monopoly on coercion. They don't have competition, and if they do, it's illegitimate competition because the government can't go out of business. In order for that to be sustained, a government must guarantee its profits / revenue through taxation or some other form of legalized theft that isn't contingent on people's willingness to fund them.",

The guard is a cake walk compared (except for the poor early gwot guys) and a great way to learn something new and experiance new things. Be positive.\n\nIf its not too late really research the jobs and pick a good one. Make sure its got civilian equivalents. Also do officer if you can. Way better treatment and pay.\n\n**You will be required to show up at least 2 days a month and at least 1 week a year and if selected for deployment (likely humanitarian shit) you will have to go. It's jail or a black mark when getting background checks for jobs and kicked out if you refuse.** But it's mostly humanitarian shit state side or riot control if you get deployed unless ww3 kicks off or some country attacks us anyway.",

You also have the wrong idea, it's not just one day a month, it's one weekend a month. Sometimes this can be 4 day \"weekends\"\n\nYes, it's taxpayer funded, but as I've had to argue in the past regarding other subjects -- taking a job offer from a corrupt organization does not in turn make you corrupt, or a bad person.\n\nAlso keep in mind, if you have a 3 year contract you do not get college paid for with the 9/11 GI bill, just the montgomery GI bill (much less money) unless you get deployed for 90 days. Same goes for the home loan -- you need 90 days of deployment.\n\nEdit: Under this administration there is a non-zero chance we go into an offensive war. Saying no is not an option. Luckily you don't have to choose a combat MOS. You're not violating the NAP as a cook or mechanic, even in war.\n\nEven combat arms doesn't violate the NAP as long as they aren't shooting civilians -- an enemy soldier is not warranted the NAP, as they are an aggressor themselves.",

This includes the soldier defending their land.\n\nThe NAP is violated by the politicians and generals who send nations to war, as well as soldiers that kill civilians -- not soldiers killing other soldiers who knowingly accepted that risk. Especially not soldiers who repaired the aircraft.\n\nViewing what you did as a violation of the NAP is the equivalent to viewing Glock's gun sales as a violation of the NAP for manufacturing and selling pistols. Colt isn't violating the NAP by manufacturing the AR-15, and neither were you by repairing flying weapon systems.",
