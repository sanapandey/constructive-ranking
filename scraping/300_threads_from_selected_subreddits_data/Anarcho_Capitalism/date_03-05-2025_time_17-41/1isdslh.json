Unfortunately the only place you can get these numbers if from the state, so idk how true this is. But if true, this is completely INSANE\n\nAlmost all jobs created have been government jobs? And what\u2019s crazier is I bet that 923,000 real jobs are part time jobs. Everyone has three of \u2018em these days..\n\n923,000 in 54 months? Only 17,000 per month? The gaslighting about the \u201cgreatest economy and the best recovery in the world\u201d have been insane. People knew the truth\n\nWe never recovered from Covid. This has been an economic disaster worse than the Great Depression. It just feels a little better because everyone is running on debt which takes the edge off. Radical course correction is needed",

(Because if it was valued by society, the free market would pay them to do it privately. But it doesn\u2019t)\n\nAnd then of course there\u2019s the people not paying taxes and just living on welfare. So can we say that 40% of the country is just flat out supporting the rest? This is not sustainable at all\n\nWatch what happens when funding is cut to the NGO, the private sector government contractors, the actually employees, and of course all the welfare abusers.

Social work isn't profitable to the wealthy, but what is the value of the life of a kid?  And if profitability is our only metric for value, then no one should have any children because all the time and effort that children take would be better used working to create profits...\nOr maybe there are many things in life that have value outside of what billionaires can exploit for profit and maybe there is plenty of work that needs to be done, that people want to do, that is of great value to society in the long term even if it isn't profitable in the short term.",

That means that in 2022, there were between 5.2 - 6.5 times as many people working in the private sector compared to the public sector (depending on how you count non-profit, etc.).

How could you objectively gather data on someone not achieving their full potential in the market, after all? But that doesn't change that the numbers are likely inaccurate. \n\nAlso, I found this definition for the state of California's underemployment data:\n\n\"Underemployed person\" means a person who has a bona fide employment but whose employment, be it full time, or part time, or intermittent, is insufficient to provide an income adequate to avoid economic deprivation.\n\nhttps://casetext.com/statute/california-codes/california-unemployment-insurance-code/division-3-employment-services-programs/part-1-employment-and-employability-services/chapter-1-general-provisions-and-definitions/article-2-definitions/section-9109-underemployed-person#:~:text=2023%20Legislative%20Session.-,Section%209109%20%2D%20Underemployed%20person,Ca.\n\nWhich is also an under-inclusive definition. Might differ from the federal definition, I couldn't find a definition on a federal site. Might've missed it due to being on mobile, but I did look. Again, probably not malicious or deliberately misleading on the part of the California government, but still not an accurate measure of what I was describing above.",

If you just reported \"employment\" as the raw number of people working in the society, then you would classify children, students, stay at home moms, retirees, and people on voluntary sabbatical as \"unemployed.\" But if only 70% of the adult population is working, what does that tell you about the economy? Is 70% good or bad? Depends - how many people actually *want* to work?  \n  \nThus, unemployment is inherently a statistic with a certain about of arbitrary subjectiveness to it. Generally, the figure is decided by looking at people who previously had a job, lost it, and haven't been able to find a new job (assuming they are actually looking), within a certain period of time. That metric is at best a generalization of the economic situation, and at worst, it can be ripe picking for misleading narratives.  \n  \nUnemployment is a flawed, but (relatively) useful metric for short term changes in the economy. It is most useful in tracking the impact and duration (in the short term) of a recession or significant policy change, for example. But whenever you want to use the statistic to track changes across multiple years/decades, it needs to be taken with a grain of salt. In my opinion, the statistic is given far too much value in public discourse and political theatre, because it is treated as sort of \"objective\" gold standard metric and people aren't careful enough about what the statistic actually is or how it should be interpreted.",

So they have to invent a whole class-based reality in their head where \"elites\" control everything, and if a fact disagrees with their narrative- it must be elitist propoganda.",
