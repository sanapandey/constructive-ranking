            "body": "If you go by the price of gold it's even worse than people realize. We've been in a race to the bottom, where the value of the dollar has dropped alongside prices. Mass production and enormous economies of scale have driven the cost of goods into the floor, so even though the value of the dollar is miserable the average person enjoys far more luxuries.\n\nWhat the fuck am I talking about? Well Henry Ford paid his assembly line workings about $1500 / year. That's ~75 ounces of gold. Given the current gold price that would be ~$214,000. These were assembly line workers.\n\nFiat currency has thoroughly fucked us, and the only reason we haven't noticed how bad it has gotten is because innovation and mass production have barely managed to keep pace with the devaluation of the dollar. Not just the dollar, actually, but all currencies.\n\nReversion to a gold standard would be incredibly painful, but ultimately it would benefit every single individual who isn't part of a government financial cartel.",

Last time people started buying up Silver and demanding physical delivery, they created a literal silver shortage and drove the price of Silver up 24x... They were eventually banned from purchasing more silver (under false pretexts). The Hunt brothers did this with only $5 billion ($17 billion in today's money inflation-adjusted). There are at least 30 people in the world today with a net worth of over $17 billion. Any of them could cause the Silver price to go up 24x from current price... Berkshire Hathaway alone is sitting on a $300 billion cash hoard. They could probably drive the price of Silver 1000x and single-handedly end the US dollar. Many institutional investors could probably unilaterally end the entire fiat monetary system just by buying up scarce assets and demanding physical delivery. Because the money is not real and its value cannot be supported by the assets which exist.",
