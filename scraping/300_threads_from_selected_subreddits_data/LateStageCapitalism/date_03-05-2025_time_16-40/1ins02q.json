            "body": "It's hardly new that defamation laws pretty much protect the worst people and the richest (lots of crossover there) from true speech. It doesn't matter if they win or lose. They have unlimited money to keep it in court, and you won't. So the goal is that it undoes the First Amendment by making it too expensive to open your mouth and say anything about them, no matter how completely true and honest it is.\n\nSo they spend money litigating until everyone is too afraid to talk about them anymore.\n\nWhen I posted a review of a landlord who broke the law, what did he do? He replied saying if I didn't remove it he'd sue me for \"Libel, defamation, and slander.\"\n\nI ended up removing it, so I guess it worked. I wanted to explain that libel and slander are forms of defamation, and pointing out that since I didn't say it, I wrote it, just threatening me with libel would have been enough. The guy owns millions in real estate and doesn't know that you don't need three words to be a thug when one would be sufficient, and more efficient.",
