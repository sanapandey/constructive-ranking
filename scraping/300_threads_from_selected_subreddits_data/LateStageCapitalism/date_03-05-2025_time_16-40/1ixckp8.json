Foege, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n* Riley P. Bechtel, chairman of the board of the Bechtel Group Inc. at the time.\n\nIn retrospect, it should have been obvious from the beginning that this was structured far more like a stock pump&dump scheme than a medical device research company.\n\nYet no-one seems to be looking above Holmes.",

The boards of directors are just their for rich people to line their pockets and provide a veneer of legitimacy for whatever the executive is doing.  Baring the rare scenario when someone on the board is gunning for the CEO spot themselves and willing to play up any controversy between shareholders to insert themselves, they just sit there and periodically draw a paycheck for being rich with zero accountability.",
