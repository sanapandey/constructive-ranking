I know it's hard to get spun up about people who show almost no class solidarity with us but they are still workers (mostly, stock options and shit muddy the waters) being exploited by the ruling class even if they don't recognize it. Brin became a stupidly rich in exactly the same way Henry Ford did in his day. The labor is different but it's labor all the same\n\n[https://gizmodo.com/googles-sergey-brin-says-engineers-should-work-60-hour-weeks-in-office-to-build-ai-that-could-replace-them-2000570025](https://gizmodo.com/googles-sergey-brin-says-engineers-should-work-60-hour-weeks-in-office-to-build-ai-that-could-replace-them-2000570025)\n\n",
