I don't ever use Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, crypto \"currency\" (a ponzi scam), or Chaff GPT (which spews out reams of text and it causing an acceleration of the Dead Internet as more and more false news stories get churned out by these things so they can put advertisements on them.)\n\nThe \"AI\" nonsense is sort of double-headed right? For now, large tech companies are spending hundreds of billions a year on it, but it will not have enough practical uses to ever be worth the money.\n\nAnd banking, well, this post forgot \"fake banks\", like Yotta and that Juno thing. If anything says \"This is a fintech, not a bank.\" Run like hell and do not put money in there.\n\nThe absolute highest returns you'll get on a real deposit banking product now are about 4.75% because that's where the Fed Funds rate is, and banks like Santander are trying to attract deposits for things like OpenBank, so they can come back later and put those teaser rates on a chopping block. It's basically bait and switch.\n\nThey're new and they have to draw attention, but a variable rate can go down whenever, maybe even tomorrow.",

If I ask it to provide steps to sustainably manage the water supply of a region it will give several \u201ccorrect\u201d suggestions but also suggests privatization of the water supply as one way to manage water shortages. If you ask it how well that plays out for farmers or communities it then admits that it\u2019s a terrible option for the people and bankrupts farmers. I always ask for references and it gave several examples where water markets were bad.",

It seems almost daily that they reach in manually and force it to adhere to \"the new truths\" like that transgender pilot that allegedly crashed the army helicopter where everyone in both aircraft died, but is also alive without a scratch. Grok lied about it, and then once the truth was undeniable, they declared that the lie they promoted via manual override, was a bug. A mistake. Yes, just a mistake. Carry on.",
