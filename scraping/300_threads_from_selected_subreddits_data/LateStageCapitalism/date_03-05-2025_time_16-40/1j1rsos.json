Its very hard to see it as anything but a gift to white supremecists.\n\nNo one wants to talk about, but Obama ran his first term being 100% against gay marriage citing his faith being against it. Somehow his \"faith\" changed when democrats were potentially losing support in deep blue states where those states were passing gay marriage laws.\n\nThen Obama never bothered to try to pass gay marriage legislation but instead it was forced on him by a SCOTUS ruling. Then after the ruling refused to push for legislation to protect it from being revoked by SCOTUS in the future, which is what is going to happen now.\n\nNo one wants to talk about it, but there was a slim window where RBG could have retired and the dems could have replaced her during Obama's first term. Obama never bothered to fight hard here and the consequences of this lead to the GOP getting 3 seats in one term and the legacy of this will be far-right rulings for a generation, if not more. This may be one of, if not the biggest, political failures in US history. Modern SCOTUS has always been a backstop for executive and congressional corruption and abuse, and now just greenstamps that corruption.\n\nNo one wants to talk about it, but the excess deaths in the war on terror is around 7-8 million civilians, mostly women and children. Obama is responsible for 8 of those years of that war, which means he has at least two or three million civilian deaths as his responsibility. These are slaughter numbers not seen often since WWII. Obama, everyday he held office, signed the death certificates for thousands of civilians. None of whom having anything to do with Al-Qaida, which itself is a very small organization tied to zero of the states being punished by the war on terror, except Afghanistan. His war on terror and his running of the Iraq war would destabilize the middle-east even further to create ISIS which led to more destruction for the innocent ME people.\n\nNo one wants to talk about it, but \"Obama had to do these things,\" is entirely false. Look at how quickly Trump shutdown the Afghanistan conflict with a relatively short timeline that coincided with Biden who was then forced to do it, seemingly against Biden's own wishes considering how often he had remind people Trump did that.  As if shutting down a massive western intervention that has killed endless civilians and fighters defending their lands from imperialists and colonizers is a bad thing. And yes Trump didnt do this for any humanitarian reason, and his reasons don't matter, what matters is that the president can shutdown wars as trivial whims as the commander in chief of all US militaries. \n\nObama is just a neolib right-moderate who will say and do anything for money and power. Liberals holding him up as some incredible person are being incredibly dishonest. I dont think he's some evil abuser or anything on a personal level, and is probably very charming in person, but in the seat of power, he acts like near anyone in seats of power. Liberals need to take responsibility for their foreign policy here and especially the genocide Biden ran. Liberals need to realize under capitalism there are no \"good guys.\"",
