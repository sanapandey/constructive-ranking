    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been working towards an engineering degree for years now, since 2020. Been going part time while working a full time job. Job is in the automotive manufacturing industry, I make near six figures but I live at work. \n\nI have a house with my wife and she is just finishing her masters in water resource policy. After this semester is over and I have my associates I have been heavily considering quitting my job in order to bust out my bachelors degree in two years while working a less stressful part time job, and cutting back on expenses/living frugally. I don\u2019t know how much longer I would be able to maintain my current work/school balance. \n\nThis has been the plan for a while but things changed with the start of this semester in January. Current events in the US have me seriously questioning my future. And things continue to get worse, though it seems half the population thinks it\u2019s getting better? \n\nI\u2019ve been fortunate to have my associates degree paid for through the future for frontliners scholarship, so right now I have no debt. I feel like I\u2019m at a crossroads where I can choose to go pay for an engineering degree and quit my decent paying job, but accrue a ton of debt and possibly lose federal aid? Or, give up on college now before I go into a shitton of debt, and maybe live in a fuckin van?\n\nThese conflicting feelings have made this semester horrible and my grades and studying habits have suffered hard. Just in a weird place and could really use some advice or different perspectives. I know people out there have to be feeling this way too",

As another commenter said, not all engineering is the same and jobs and salaries in that field are not guaranteed. I wouldn\u2019t quit and accrue the debt. It isn\u2019t worth it and right now with student loan forgiveness likely being permanently removed, it\u2019s not a path I would recommend for anyone. Keep your associate\u2019s in your back pocket if you ever lose your current job but otherwise, stay put.",

That being said, I strongly encourage you to pursue your education\u2014whether in engineering or any other field. It\u2019s not just about the degree or skill set you\u2019ll gain; it\u2019s about the connections you\u2019ll make, the experiences that will shape you, and the person you\u2019ll become.\n\nYou may change your mind and explore a different type of engineering. You may even pivot entirely toward the arts or sciences. Who knows? But one thing is certain\u2014you will come out of it a different person.\n\nSpend your time wisely. Enjoy yourself. Be mindful of your finances and keep an eye on the future, but don\u2019t live in fear of it. One of the greatest things I experienced in college and grad school was meeting people from all over the world\u2014people who deeply influenced my worldview, my politics, and my perspective on life.\n\nCan you find this kind of growth in other ways? Absolutely. But higher education is one of the most intense and transformative environments for it.\n\nSo, good luck. And remember\u2014there are a lot of us out here fighting for you.",

You might be okay for something like structural or civics engineering, but it's been very difficult to find a job in tech at entry level to junior levels right now. Lots of tech layoffs so the market is extremely competitive.\n\nWhenever I see people ask what job fields are good right now, people always say, the trades. Then again who knows what the market looks like in 2-4 years after you graduate.\n\nAlso student loans right now are so unpredictable, for the last 5 years people with student loans have been dicked around constantly needing to adjust their budget to deal with the drama of student loans and the courts blocking the repayment and forgiveness plans.\n\nI would not rely on any form of income based repayment plan to exist for very long. I would make decisions assuming you would be making full payments with no government reductions or assistance, or at the mercy of private loans.\n\nedit: this loan simulator can give a better idea of what your payment would look like \n\n[https://studentaid.gov/loan-simulator](https://studentaid.gov/loan-simulator)",

Would it not be possible to work out an agreement with the company to cut your hours for the remainder of your time in school? Maybe this has occurred to you already, but I also know the corporate landscape is harsh enough to deter even asking in the first place sometimes. Keeping that rate of pay with a better school-work-life balance might be desirable and leave you with more options if/when you complete the degree (you\u2019ve accrued savings to offset the debt or could take out smaller loans, you can spend longer applying to other jobs that wouldn\u2019t take you without the degree because you still have a secure income). My experience has been that if you\u2019re easy to work with, reliable, and show some degree of initiative, people might just make some exceptions to keep you onboard. \n\nThis would hinge on other factors you\u2019d know better than any of us: your mortgage, whether your wife has been working, what kind of pay she\u2019d get if moving to a new job with the degree, if the agreement with management is good enough, maintains benefits, etc. Moreover, whether it\u2019s the work itself or just its combination with part time college that\u2019s the main source of your ills. As someone who is four degrees off a bachelor\u2019s it seems impossible to break back into because of my high-stress job, debt and shitty pay, I wish I\u2019d just gotten it done with.
