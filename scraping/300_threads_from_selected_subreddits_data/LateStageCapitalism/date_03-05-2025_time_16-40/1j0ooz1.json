Freedom is a buzz word. The police and armed forces exist only to protect capital and the owners. \n\nWe need to adjust how we view the current world order. ",

What we have isn't remotely democracy, and they are scared of nothing more than the prospect of legitimate democracy. \n\nIt's hilarious to me hearing people decry Marx and Lenin over the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" phrase. The proletarians are the masses. What's another term for the absolute rule of the masses? Democracy.",

Despite the optics, Western political and corporate elites think nothing of arming dealing to facilitate genocide or giving unconditional diplomatic support to a state engaged in crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing, as it's highly profitable. They have zero ethics, zero respect for international law, human rights or regard for human life. They only respect capital and power. We shouldn't be surprised when the high-tech surveillance and cutting-edge weapons of occupation tested on Palestinians are purchased and rolled out by our authoritarian Western governments to monitor, police and terrorise their own citizens.",
