    "selftext": "Hello, fellow humans. Like everyone else, I've been struggling to maintain sanity amidst the shitstorm of information. When it gets too dark, I like to give myself the same reminder that I'll offer here.\n\nBill Hicks famously said, \"It's just a ride.\" \n\nNaw, man. It's just a game. A big, old, shitty game with shitty GameMasters with shitty homebrew rules.\n\nFor context, I've spent most of my career in corporate finance. Mostly Fortune 100 and private equity. I was a pawn, not one of the rich bastards. I'm as financially fucked as anyone else. After being coerced into enriching the most vile, elitist subhuman trash on earth, I finally yeeted myself from it a couple years ago. I'm also a huge gamer nerd.\n\nThere is a silver lining to being forced into a digital economy. It exposes the economic system for what it is: a big, dumb, rigged computer game.\n\nOnce upon a time, the banking system printed paper (I know it's not technically paper; please follow the point) to represent a fraction of quantities of pretty, shiny metal.\n\nNow, the banking system prints paper to represent a tiny fraction of what only exists in databases. \n\n**It's just fucking data.**\n\nA giant, convoluted score-keeping system for a LARP (live action roleplaying game) that we've all been coerced into playing. How is this a LARP?\n\n* We take on roles (I play with spreadsheets!)\n* We take on titles (Look ma, I'm a Controller)\n* We get dressed up for cosplay (suit & tie today cuz board members are visiting)\n* We exist in imaginary kingdoms (Corps only exist on paper)\n* We go on endless fetch quests (we need to increase EBITDA by 5%)\n* We are awarded imaginary treasure (thanks for the digital tokens)\n\nThe obvious dark truth is that the LARP has dire real-world consequences. Thank you, Squid Games, for the slightly hyperbolic illustration. The rules of the game compel humans to deprive fellow humans of the essentials needed for survival, let alone contentment and happiness.\n\nBut it is a game all the same. And the rules of a game can be changed. And if the game is shitty enough, the players can ditch it and go play something else.\n\nOur great struggle lies in the fact that our lived reality has been forced to conform to a shitty game. In a better world, we would play games that conform to reality, and foster a better one.\n\nWhat can we do? My brain is too small to solve this. But at some point, the players will get sufficiently fed up with the shitty GameMasters and stop playing. Or maybe the house rules the GameMasters are making up will render the game unplayable. In any case, this is not the end for us. At some point, this game will be buried in a landfill like so many copies of that pathetic ET game^(1) for the Atari 2600. And then we can collectively engage in new cooperative gameplaying that is fun and rewarding for everyone, getting real shit done in the process.\n\nOne more thing. I like to occasionally look at satellite photos of the earth to remind me of what reality looks like. It's a rock in space crawling with trillions of lifeforms. Countries don't actually exist. The USA is a few pieces of paper, a logo, and a theme song. Brainwashing 8 billion people into thinking it's real makes us all act like it's real. But it's not. It's all imaginary bullshit superimposed like a transparency over reality. And it's just as thin and flimsy. \n\n**Every single executive, politician, monarch, and dictator in the world is a goddamn, motherfucking cosplayer.**\n\nBut what do I know? I'm a solitary nerd behind a keyboard. What do you think?\n\n^(1) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari\\_video\\_game\\_burial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_video_game_burial)",

            "body": "After spending years in the corporate machine, it finally dawned on me 15 years ago that all of the systems employed to organize modern civilization, especially economic, are incompatible with reality and destined for failure. For instance, our full labor model was established \\~300 years ago and assumed that every able-bodied person would have to work. This assumption predates one agricultural revolution, two industrial revolutions, steam power, electric power, computers, the internet, and so forth.\n\nThe reality is that humans don't have to labor as hard as they did in the 1600s. There's simply not that much to do. But we are bound to an economic model that believes this. The model has been propped up by competition, redundancy, hyperconsumerism, planned obsolescence, and bullshit jobs. But this will not last. As long as the model is enforced, societal collapse is inevitable.\n\nBeing a gaming nerd has offered some levity and perspective on the matter. It's all made up rules. It's on paper, in computers, and in our heads. But it can all be changed.",

While I agree with and appreciate the game metaphor for the economy - everything that's digital is still physical and requires real world energy and materials. When we change the rules of the game we need to incorporate things like ecosystem services and emphasize the real costs of energy and materials.",

People will kill for those numbers to go up, they'll create a new slave caste for those numbers to go up. Then, when they finally have control over it, when a dollar bill is as useless as a nickel, they can dictate who does and does not have the numbers to allow their continued existence.\n\nI mean, we're basically there now.

Media, School, and Social Media washes the truth. Everyday let your driving force be, to uncover one Truth.  \n\nMy degree is in Mathematics, and I sacrificed my lovely \"privileged home life,\" in pursuit of an Education.  Turns out that very thing is my ticket to sanity. How I relate this information to others is a skill I pride myself on. \n\nDo the following (I have): \n1. Stay up on current events, this keeps one in the present tense.\n\n2. Knowledge of self.  I've uncovered Truths about people I identify with through painstaking research. These events have happened and one can only stay in the past tense when referencing historical people. \n\n3. Plan for the future, write down personal goals first for the day, then month, and then five years from now. This is the unknown it's yet to be met.",
