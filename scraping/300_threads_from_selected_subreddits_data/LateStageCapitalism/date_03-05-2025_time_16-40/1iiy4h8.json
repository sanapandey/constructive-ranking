It sounds laughable to italians and sprouted a lot of memes when the doge meme first came around.\n\n\"Duce\" is a modern word created by Mussolini and popularized by the fascist establishment. It had no relationship with \"Duca\" or \"Doge\" (he would have used those words, which had still a bit of use at that time) and was created to sound like latin, to make the head of state look like a modern roman general.\n\nI can absolutely confirm they are not interchangeable and I don't think he can be used as a whistle for american fascists.",
