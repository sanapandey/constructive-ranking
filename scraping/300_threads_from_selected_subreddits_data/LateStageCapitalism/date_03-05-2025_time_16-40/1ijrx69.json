Absolute corrupt people, who are always and only looking backwards and solely towards their own and their friend's profits. Never progression for the people, don't even care for their citizens. No matter who you elect, at the end it's always the same people in control even when the front face changes. Always ethnic conflicts arising before elections, like clockwork.  No free media left, critical press agencies have been killed off or are tiny and struggling. \n\nThe last bit was the military steamrolling over the protest camps and forbading all protests because a new, different president was elected, some years ago.

Liberalism is a right-wing ideology. \n\nLiberal doesn't mean \"progressive\", the liberal political movement is far broader than people in the US seem to understand. The liberal movement is the bourgeois political movement, the Bourgeoisie being the class that established the United States and the \"democratic\" system as it exists in the US, most of Europe and the former colonies. It is a movement to establish bourgeois supremacy socially, political and economically. The other term for the bourgeois economic order is: captialism. \n\nIn short, where you see \"liberal democracies\" (with party pluralism , representative assemblies etc.) and captialism - that is a country/state under liberal rule. \n\nDemocrats and Republicans in the US both represent different forms of liberalism. \n\nBecause political education in the US is poor, everything left of center in the US vernacular is classed as \"liberal\". This is also due to years of despotism under the country's two party duopoly. It's confused how a political system is supposed to work. Outside of the US, the liberal movement is better understood as a much broader, encompassing movement. \n\nA good book on the history of Liberalism, presented here in html format:  https://en.prolewiki.org/wiki/Library:Liberalism:_A_Counter-History\n\nIf this book is too complex, I can find something similar but easier. Not to be mean, just that it may be your first time with poltical theory and the translated italian in this is tricky.",
