I would say a sort of market/socialism hybrid with worker owned co-ops and employee-owned companies. the company i work for is employee owned and i actually feel like im part of something and am treated much better than other places I've been employed.\n\n   I would put a hard cap limit of $5 million dollars net worth for anybody.  that's already more than anybody should have. if we have a minimum wage we should also have a maximum. we've seen how destructive it is when wealth can get out of control. all of our lives are essentially in the hands of 800 billionaires in the US.\n\nA hard cap like that would also give people something to strive for and be much more attainable. It would revitalize the American dream. \"wow man, you did it. You achieved the maximum level\" ... this does not take away from anybody; it gives everybody else a realistic chance. \n\n  I like the idea of the freedom dividend that Andrew Yang talked about in 2020.  \n\nall major industries should be publicly owned as well.",
