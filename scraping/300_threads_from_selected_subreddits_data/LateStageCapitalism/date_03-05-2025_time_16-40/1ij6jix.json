    "selftext": "My Relationship With My Biological Grandfather Is Like a Rick & Morty Episode\n\nAlright, Reddit. Here\u2019s a story so bizarre that even the most self-righteous basement dwellers might pause their dopamine-fueled doomscrolling for a moment of contemplation. Imagine finding your biological grandfather at 21\u2014a retired physicist, professor emeritus, and, in many ways, my Rick Sanchez. The man is brilliant, condescending, and completely unaware of how easy he\u2019s had it his entire life. Meanwhile, I spent years playing the Morty in our dynamic, desperately seeking validation, only to be met with dismissive remarks, passive-aggressive jabs, and the occasional \u201cgood job, sport\u201d before he pivots back to his own accomplishments.\n\nIf anything, I\u2019ve been slowly shifting into my Evil Morty arc, realizing I don\u2019t actually need his approval to exist.\n\nThe Grandfather Paradox (But Not the Cool Sci-Fi Kind)\n\nWhenever an issue arises with his old house\u2014bought for $18K in 1971 (a number that should infuriate all of you)\u2014I\u2019m usually the one who finds the correct solution. Yet, when I ask him for advice on major life hypotheticals, like returning to school or proving eligibility for citizenship, his answer is always the same: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think you will.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that I need his permission\u2014I know I can do these things. But I just want to know that when the time comes, I\u2019ll have the option to live with him and take care of my grandmother when he\u2019s gone.\n\nHe grew up in a world I can\u2019t even begin to relate to. He attended Stuyvesant, an all-boys engineering school in Lower Manhattan, commuting alone on the subway as an 8-year-old in the 1940s\u2014something that would be unthinkable today and probably a testament to when New York City was at peak civilization. Meanwhile, my childhood was the complete opposite. I was a white minority in a school district dominated by every major gang, where racism and violence were just part of the daily routine.\n\nHe met my grandmother the way everyone did in the 1950s\u2014at camp. How cringe? Meanwhile, I met m\u2019lady online before we finally connected in VR Summer Camp. Because apparently, that\u2019s just what modern romance is now.\n\nNo Portal Gun, No Easy Answers\n\nIf I had a portal gun, I\u2019d go back and teach my younger self self-esteem, identity, and self-love. I\u2019d tell him that life isn\u2019t as binary as DJT-era regulations make it seem\u2014alpha vs. beta, liberal vs. conservative, masculine vs. feminine. But we don\u2019t get do-overs. We just have to live with what we know and navigate life as best we can.\n\nAnd no amount of intellectual posturing from my liberal upper-class grandfather can change the fact that I am still here. My grandmother, bless her, has only ever spoken back to him under her tongue. Meanwhile, I avoid escalating arguments because I genuinely care for them, despite everything. After we\u2019ve shared our whiskey and wine and eaten a home-cooked meal in their turn-of-the-century dream home, some nights, it isn\u2019t enough to numb the pains and regrets of life.\n\nSometimes, I have to remind myself of my reality with my grandfather. Sometimes, I have to test simulation theory because it\u2019s the closest thing to peace. Testing his stoic facade by pushing his buttons on the death of my father finally elicited a response\u2014as if years of trauma between us had finally been put to rest. Although, in classic Rick fashion, he still found a way to blame me for begging him to dig it up. His way of expressing his grief was an excuse for an otherwise unemotional man.",
