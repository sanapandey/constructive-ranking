Humans with armies of robots at their call.\n\nFirst they take everything over.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5RpPTRcz1no\n\nThen they build their little closed utopias (being built now)\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PHlcAx-I0oY&pp=ygUfVGVjaCBiaWxsaW9uYWlyZXMgc2hvY2tpbmcgcGxvdA%3D%3D\n \nTo have the end goal just like these solarians:\n\nhttps://aliens.fandom.com/wiki/Solarian_(Foundation)\n\n\nTraditionally these type of closed systems have never worked and have fallen apart quickly. But what if they had an army of drones and killer robots?  A very very small amount of people could keep invaders out and keep the people inside in check as well.\n\n\nThis is the future we must fight. Billions will die as we lose usefulness to our overlords. If you work in tech on robots. Just know that the high salary and your big house are being traded for future of your childrens\u2019. Stop all robotic research immediately and defund the oligarchs.",

Suddenly the US had a bunch of strong, traumatized men who they'd trained in the warfrare and tactics to overthrow citites and Governments in Europe. And you told those guys that Capitalism was better than Socialism, that it would make their lives better.\n\nAnd they realized that if those guys didn't see that better life soon, they might get overthrown too. And they needed for it to seem like Capitlaism was winning - but only until the Soviets finally succumbed to collapse after decades of embargos and attack from the rest of the world. So as soon as Soviet influence started weakening, the started undermining the \"American Dream\". By the late 90s all bets were off, the Greatest Generation was too old to do anything about it, and living standards have fallen ever since. \n\nIt was a 4-decade period that was more about \"beating the commies\" than anything else. And now we're seeing what Capitalism has always been about: a return to Feudalist classism and exreme wealth gaps. Instead of being tied to the land, people are tied to their debt.",

They do release blooper reels of the robots stacking in comical ways, the robots being covered in scratches is a big hint and no-one else comes close to them yet. It takes a huge team of humans to make them do what they do. In the blooper reels they have clips of the back flipping robot's ankles blowing and squirting hydraulics fluid everywhere. They suffer from wear and tear and require a level of dexterity to fix that robots are incapable of currently.\n\nIn our imagination it is easy to imagine that highly dexterous generalist robots could be created but in reality we may find there are hard material limits to what is possible. A bit like how interstellar space travel is easy to imagine but is made effectively impossible as we imagine in science fiction due to relativity and time dilation.\n\nDrone swarms are very possible and terrifying. I'm relatively confident though that any robot apocalypse launched by the 1% in the next 50-100 years will require an army of human technicians to build and keep them running as meat beats metal when it comes to dexterity and flexibility.",
