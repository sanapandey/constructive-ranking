This article glorifies parasitic investors and denigrates working people who own less than ever. I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s an attempt at propaganda or completely out of touch. The bottom 90% might be spending less because they don\u2019t have enough, meanwhile they\u2019re talking about the rich like they\u2019re doing some charity for the economy. Is the WSJ trolling us or are my plebeian eyes just not meant to see this bourgeoisie literature?",
