                            "body": "Dem insiders are pissed at their own support groups like move and indivisible because they dared to ask them to do something. \n\nThey keep repeating to people asking them to do things \u201cthose are good ideas and people with good ideas should run for office\u201d. It blows my mind\n\nThat meeting yesterday schumer does the condescending \u201cyou should run\u201d to someone who did run, and won, which was why she was there. \n\nThen after the groups get into arguments the Dem insiders tell the activist groups \u201call this is off the record\u201d but then immediately they run to Center right News axios and they leak how angry they are about their own supporters to them. \n\nThey just want to kick back and use all the bad things trump is doing to send fundraiser emails, which they will then utilize on the same media and strategists that ran their campaigns last time, which in many cases happen to be their close friends and family members\n\nThey\u2019re better than the Republican Party by a mile, and the level of corruption we are seeing now is unprecedented, but their decades of \u201ccivility\u201d, working across the aisle, neoliberal policies and slowly moving left on social issues while tacking hard to the right on economic issues is what led to this mess, and the public being pissed off enough to burn it down. \n\nThe house oversight committee voted on subpoenaing Elon musk to testify before Congress. They failed the vote 19-20. Several dems did not vote or were not in attendance. Ro Khanna was off to Silicon Valley having closed door meeting with the \u201cgood\u201d tech oligarchs and the ones still in the dem camp, and ensuring them they\u2019ll have access in a future dem administration. \n\nDems are refusing to vocalize to the public how the things that are taking place will hurt them. Instead of combatting misinformation on things like the consumer protection bureau, they\u2019re just saying \u201cwe will fight, we hear you, we need unity, PrEsIdEnT MuSK!?\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s tone deaf. And after the meeting yesterday I\u2019m convinced they\u2019re controlled opposition to be honest. \n\nRepublicans won\u2019t be able to pass a budget by themselves, but Schumer has already stated Dems aren\u2019t going to obstruct their budget and demand concessions, they\u2019re just going to let them pass it. \n\nWhen the freeze happened, Schumer instructed Dem senators to \u201cdownplay the freeze and any potential policy responses, and instead choose one cabinet pick to do a protest vote in\u201d. If the show were on the other foot, Republicans would be voting no on every single one of our picks. They even vote no on our appointments when we \u201cwork across the aisle\u201d and make \u201cbig tent\u201d moves by putting Republicans in cabinet positions, which we should stop fucking doing. \n\nThey act like the hate what\u2019s taking place but they refuse to condemn and explain how many of the actions will hurt voters because it would upset their corporate donors. We need to oust all these ghouls in the primaries. \n\nIt was blowing my mind that it appeared to only be lefties that were mad while Dem party loyalists were blaming minorities and Palestinians, but even the neo-lib dem party worshippers seem to be getting angry now. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019d say we need an entire new political party and to just burn the Dems down since they\u2019re in the way and actively helping republicans in many instances, but I\u2019m not sure how feasible or what the process for something like that would be.",
