In this sub, we're generally a fan of union because they protect workers.  Imagine living where you work with your co-workers and family from birth to death with your boss being unable to fire you or evict you -- that's serfdom.  Labor had considerable rights enforced by real-world solidarity that today's workers lack.  Now some people didn't like the \"small town\" environment or restrictions of serfdom.  If you ran away to a town and lived there for a year, then you were \"free\" of the serf's rights/obligations.  Lots of people went from free to serf and vice versa so it wasn't a fixed social status.  Slavery is ownership of people with no choice / options / rights.",

Highly recommend his book by the same name or any of his many recent podcast/interview appearances. \n\ntl;dr:  \n\"Technofeudalism\u2014you might already have some sense of what the term means, even if you haven\u2019t sat down and unpacked it fully. A mode of production with one hand in the past and another the future\u2014an updated form of feudal relations married to an advanced epoch of the productive forces that mark late capitalism\u2014forces that we often associate with futuristic feats of technology. Except this is not some kind of techno-utopia\u2014it\u2019s really a dystopia.\"\n\n  \nTaken from his recent interview on Upstream where he gives a solid breakdown of the topic:\n\n[https://podtail.com/en/podcast/upstream/technofeudalism-w-yanis-varoufakis/](https://podtail.com/en/podcast/upstream/technofeudalism-w-yanis-varoufakis/)",
