    "selftext": "I love this show and this is a [good take](https://atmos.earth/the-high-price-of-paradise-in-the-white-lotus-season-3/) on Season 3. Even though it is critical of the capitalist system and how harmful colonialism is, the article falls short of acknowledging that the show is the very product of the thing it is criticising. The show's production company HBO is owned by the billionaire Newhouse family and Warner Media is run by Zionist David Zaslav. The production of the show itself is an example of colonial extraction, and \"The White Lotus\" effect is even a thing now (as the article explains). I also guess this had a big production team likely leaving a huge footprint of emissions and consumption. I wish publications like this would go deeper into it instead of taking the show at face value.\n\nShows like this create a false sense of security, making viewers believe that class consciousness is real. In reality, it's a commodified version\u2014an illusion of progress\u2014while you pay a subscription to the ruling class to consume their propaganda. Ironically, it also serves as a large advertisement for destructive tourism.\n\nConsuming even capital critical media produced by capitalism is just more consumption.\n\n\\[Spoiler for S03E01 in Article\\]",
