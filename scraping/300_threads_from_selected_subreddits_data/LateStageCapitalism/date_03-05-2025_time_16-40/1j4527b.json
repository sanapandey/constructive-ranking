                    "body": "I honestly disagree with this excuse given for the US population. If it were true, then the average American would change their perspective when presented with new information, this is how someone who is purely ignorant behaves. \n\nHowever, Americans don't operate in such a matter. They will rhetorically battle with you for presenting the truth. The truth of the matter is they *want* to believe in the imperialist nonsense.\n\nThey cling to whatever belief justifies imperialism because they fundamentally understand that their life is improved by the American empire dominating the world. \n\nYou will never convince a capitlist to give up their wealth and support the establishment of socialism because the capitalist knows that it's against their material interest. The bourgeoisie knows their interests so well that they construct fascism as a way to fight socialism when in danger. \n\nSimilarly, the average American does this calculation. They recognize that their quality of life is tied to dollar hedgomony, tied to the suppression of wages in the global south, tied to the suffering of the global proletariat. They are convinced of these facts, even if unaware, and they respond to socialists debunking them accordingly, they respond to us as a threat. A threat to empire and, therefore, a threat to them. \n\nHowever, this consideration, which you've probably determined by this point in reading my comment, is not factual. Americans, though they attain many circuses from the fruits of empire, are continually and increasingly lacking in bread. Empire produces increases to the quality of life, but also necessarily takes them away in an unstable fashion.\n\nAs time as marched on and capitalism has festetered, more and more Americans have realized that being a citizen of an empire does not provide for them at the expense of others. It provides extensively for a select few who throw stale leftovers to a shrinking portion of the population. \n\nThose leftovers used to be larger, but they were not all-encompassing. For example, the black population has never received these imperial fruits to the same degree as the white population. Within the various discriminated groups across the US, anti-capitalist thought is tolerated more (not fully accepted since this is the core of the empire). \n\nAs capitalism ravages a larger portion of the population, we are beginning to see this trend extend to broader and broader categories. Those who benefit little to nothing from imperial plunder and less likely to defend it, especially when they've never benifeted before. \n\nThose who historically have, such as the white population, are also likely to want to \"turn things back,\" so to speak, and given into reactionary movements. This is where many liberals will go when push comes to shove. \n\nWhat this all means is quite simple. The question of how to get people to give up their willing misinformation isn't by simply confronting them with the truth, as mentioned, there is no interest in truth, only material benefit. \n\nWhat needs to be communicated is how socialism makes empire irrelevant. We need to describe the instability of empire and how a humanistic reorientation will *benefit*  them more than empire can. \n\nHowever, it must be discussed how social democrats, who aim to preserve empire but attempt to improve material conditions, are charlatans at worst and naive at best. Their methods will reproduce capitalism, which refuses to die unless the working class controls a monopoly on violence. \n\nThe American people are not simply misinformed about the crimes of imperialism. They are willingly ignorant and racist because they believe that empire is the only way to preserve their material conditions. The policies don't matter. It's the belief in empire that must be confronted. Making it clear how socialism is the alternative to empire is the way to collapse the willingness to defend imperialism.",
