Idk, like something about the way that playing with randoms will pair those kinds of players side by side with players actually trying to win on the same team and in wildly disparate matchups against differing mixes of \"players trying to win\" vs \"players who want to do what they feel and are mad at game interactions for not letting them do that\" on the other team.\n\nAnyway I think about that a lot whenever I see people's very reasonable reaction to Democrats caring more about demanding obedience and unearned praise and punishing people who voted for them than they do about actually winning the goddamn election or fighting the opponent in front of them.\n\nEdit: Also on the further topic of punishing people on your side: Armored Core 6 is centered around a stagger system and staggering enemies into a big damage punish. It also has a boost kick attack that has lots of knockback. Good team play consists of staggering enemies into your teammates' punish and doing whatever it takes to keep the enemy pinned in place for everyone's weapons to hit. Rando team play consists of kicking enemies out of your teammates's punish all of the time and putting all of your team's biggest guns on long cooldown for nothing because you wanted to feel cool about your own self-centered kick combo.\n\nI also think about that a lot when I look at the way the Democratic Party drained funds away from much needed Get Out The Vote efforts on the ground",
