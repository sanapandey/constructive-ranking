I have been listening to John Elmer's segments on the electronic intifada and he was talking about when one of the resistance groups blew up an APC with many soldiers the Israelis would only report one or 2 dead while it was obvious the whole crew were gonners and at the same time there's constant sniper missions and cat bulldozers being blown up too. Sometimes a senior officer would get shot and they'd have to report it but the 3 other juniors who got shot in the same sniper operation were not reported.\n\nAlso some time ago one medivac helicopter squadron celebrated doing more medivacs than Israel had reported casualties. And the other medivac squadrons hadn't been sitting on their arses either.",
