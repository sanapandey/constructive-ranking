And only the person can decide what class they are in and what interests matter most to them in that class.\n\n\nSo instead of being able to pay their bills they care about trans people in sports, etc.\n\n\nThat's why Trump supporters seemingly vote against their best interests. They've decided other factors besides their personal economy is in their best interests in an effort to be, in spirit, a part of the powerful billionaire class. That's why they can tell them who their enemy is. If you think like that you are one of them. Essentially cosplaying the powerful elite but with zero in the bank. With magical thinking they really believe it is true. Or at least wish really really hard it is so they will do terrible things to make it so.\n\n\nAre Trump voters redeemable. Redemption depends on the individual. That's not my work. That's theirs. You can't do the work for a person who convinced themselves of the irrational. However I am deeply suspect of anyone who is only remorseful because they were hurt by this administration. I don't trust selfish people.\n\n\nhttps://snyder.substack.com/p/class-war-or-culture-war",

And it has been here every since.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, what isn't as pressed upon and is even more damaging is when union leaders utilized the same culture war tactics to keep black and brown people from joining their unions in the 1930's. Then that's peer against peer in the working class. It undermines our strength. And we can still see the effects of that today. There's a reason there's white and black police offocer unions.\n\n\nIt's an old playbook:\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dfJAp7NwgVA?si=X5qTwRWOkMiFBZBl\n\n\n\n\n@ 5:22 is history they don't want us to learn so they frame it as DEI and CRT so people who can't handle the truth jump up not to learn the facts that will give them more power:\n\n\n\"Fast forward to the 1930's. And you have white labor leaders... They're not even the elite, right? The labor leaders are not the \"elite\" elite but they are the elite with the labor movement. And even they had fallen for it (the benefits of being excluding people based on race) at this point. So they didn't want to integrate their unions.\n\n\nAnd they would say things like: Well we can't have Black people and Mexicans and Chinese folks in our unions because if we do that it's going to reduce the professionalism of our craft. We have to maintain the integrity of our profession.\u00a0\n\n\nNo fool! You need more people in the damn union is what you need! And if you don't let those folks in guess what happens. When you go out on strike who is the boss going to use to replace you? They are going to replace you with the very same black and brown folks you didn't want to work next to. Right? And then you're going to blame them for taking your job rather than the white rich dude for giving it to them. Divide and conquer.\"\n\n\n*\"Well we can't have Black people and Mexicans and Chinese folks in our unions because if we do that it's going to reduce the professionalism of our craft. We have to maintain the integrity of our profession.\"*\n\n\nSounds an awfully lot like today's \"meritocracy\" smokescreen to me. And everyone who is being laid off due to DEi will undercut any white man working today to pay their bills. And billionaires are loving it. Nine times out of ten when you think you're playing the game, someone's playing you.\n\n\nDEI ain't nothing new. It's been around for over 60 years. And who has benefited the most from DEI? White women.\n\n\nPersons who benefited the second most? White men. Tbf white people make up the majority in the population in the US so in a program that is truly inclusive that makes sense.\n\n\n\n\nMajority of veterans are white men. Some are neurodivergent. Some are part of the LGBTQIA community. Sometimes are disabled, etc. All of those groups benefited from DEI.\n\n\nIt's a shame that we can turn on each other. But the root cause isn't a misinformation issue. It's a relational disconnect that was already there, we've been neglecting too long, and the wealthy class took advantage.",
