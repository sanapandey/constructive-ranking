He was,  as far as I'm aware,  the only major politician to say this,  and when the Depression hit, all the money flowed out and down went Germany.  This gave hitler a lot of credit in the eyes of the public. \n\n\nAlso, in Rise and Fall of The Third Reich,  William Shirer tells how he was told that,  because America was considered a friendly country by the Nazis, he was being given advanced warning that at midnight Hitler was going to declare war on the US, so hey on a plane now or you'll be arrested at midnight. \n\n\nRise and Fall of The Third Reich is an excellent book. It was written by a non-European journalist who was in Germany from I think the late 1920s, and he had a lot of access to the nazis once they were in charge,  because he was American,  and the nazis liked America.",

Putin surely knows that Trump is trying to befriend him and weaken the bond between Russia and China (who are neighbors and trade together as well).\n\nPutin is an anticommunist and wanted the Soviet Union to fall so maybe Putin isn't all that bothered by America's hand in that.  Putin is seeing the US' ongoing betrayal of Ukraine.\n\nWasn't Russia part of the G7 briefly?  If I'm not mistaken, Putin either did join NATO at one point or at least wanted to.\n\nPutin knows about the US funding rebels and then later calling them terrorists and going to war with them.\n\nThe reality is that if Putin were to make the US and Russia neutral so that the US could go after China, of course Russia could be next.  In practice there almost certainly wouldn't be a next though.  War with China would be war between the two most advanced modern militaries, both of which possess nukes.\n\nPutin should continue to trade with China and be friendly with China and whether it be spoken or unspoken have it be understood that the US can't be the sole hegemon and that it is now a multipolar world with Russia and China countering the US.\n\nThis is probably wishful thinking on my part but whatever the date is that the US needs to go to war with China by becomes closer every day.  My hope is that the date comes and passes and that the US will be obligated to shut down military bases and decommission a lot of nukes because it is no longer financially viable to maintain them.\n\nThe reality though is that the cop cities are going up.  Homelessness is being criminalized.  Conditions will continue to deteriorate within the empire and the big war will happen if the ruling class wants it and the increased police budgets will ensure that people can't protest war.  Of course people on this sub are pro-Palestine.  The weapons of war that were used on Palestinians will soon be utilized domestically by the IDF trained cops from the cop cities.",
