I was arguing with Dems on here years ago that the West was escalating the situation because they wanted a conflict with Russia and their reply was \"what would the West want from a conflict?\" Well there you go, you found out today. The US has been trying to isolate Russia since Clinton, they've been running war games that they knew would unsettle Russia for years going back at least to Obama, they whispered in Ukraine's ear to raise the prices they charged Russia for Sevastopol knowing it was a critical asset for them, the CIA was 100% behind the 2014 coup because Putin was trying to normalize diplomatic relations with Ukraine, and then they started moving weapons platforms right up against Russia's border knowing full well it was an instigation. They always wanted a weakened Ukraine so that they could demand extraction rights in exchange for \"helping\" them, but they knew they had to get Putin to fire the first shot. Oh, and a bonus, they get to sell the weapons used in the conflict and boost the military industrial complex, then get the heavy metals when the fighting stops.\n\nBut everyone these days just reduces it down to \"Trump's a Russian plant!\" No, you're just not paying attention. Both sides are playing the game, only one side convinced you that they're not.",
