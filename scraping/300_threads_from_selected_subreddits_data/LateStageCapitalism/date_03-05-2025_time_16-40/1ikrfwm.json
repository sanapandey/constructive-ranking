            "body": "Trump shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently and is now trying to sack everyone who works there and delete their entire archive of research into the financial industry and records of its patterns of abuse.\n\nThe Democrats created the CFPB, and its job is simply to curtail some of the worst practices in banking, and to return money to cheated customers. It's funded by the banks and part of the Federal Reserve.\n\nIts major accomplishments were making banks tell you what you are agreeing to when you sign up for a banking product, and to go after them and fine them and return money to consumers when the banks still manage to cheat you, within the framework of what they said they would do to you.\n\nSome of the worst and most predatory banks, like Credit One, not only survived, but thrived, during the time the CFPB was operational, and yet the Republicans still want to shut it down.\n\nOne reason I can think of is that they know Trump's policies are going to lead to a Second Great Depression, and they want to bury the market research into things like how many people can no longer afford to pay their credit cards, and what percentage of people are having the car that they need to get to work and medical appointments and stuff towed away, and how many people are losing their house, and so on.\n\nWith Trump suing the news and making them \"donate\" to him every time they report the facts and a Republican \"catch and kill\" team censoring PBS and NPR, you will not hear about the pain and suffering.\n\nThis morning in my car, I heard NPR saying that retail sales in January were the worst they've been in years, then they blamed \"the weather\", not record consumer debts and minimum credit card payments and defaults, and record amounts owed on underwater car loans, and mass layoffs. It will get worse.\n\nIn Russia, Putin's explanation for everything that goes wrong is to have scientists killed and he says they \"walk out of windows\" or a Russian ammo dump explodes and that was the sixth one this week, and \"it was all careless people with cigarettes\". Well, with Trump, the Putinification of the media has already happened.\n\nHe threw out all the actual news companies and NPR out of the Pentagon, then blamed the passenger jet collision with the army helicopter on \"DEI\". Then the far-right blamed the crash on a transgender pilot, who is still alive. Then they continued to blame DEI. Then weeks later, they go \"Oh yeah, and the altimeter wasn't working.\"\n\nTrump hates the media. So he brings in Newsmax, OANN, and others that will never ever fact check him or put him on the spot. He kills the agencies that compile data that will show how horrible the economy gets.\n\nEverything around us will stop and we will have no actual information at all.\n\nThe Democrats aren't interested in slowing him down, in many cases they've actually joined forces with him in an all out frontal assault on Immigrants, like the Laken Riley bill which expands deportation and destroys due process.\n\nThey don't plan to save us from Trump. They plan to give him exactly what he wants, like they did last time.",
