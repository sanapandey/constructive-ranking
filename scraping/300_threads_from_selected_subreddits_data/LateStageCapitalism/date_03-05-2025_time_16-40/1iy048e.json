The real question is, why do you need to lie about my views in order to argue against them?",

The world revolves around you.\n\nYou said and I quote:\n\n>Its astonishing how they cant forward think literally one step past the fuition of their goals. So hamas win? What next? Literally, what next?\n\nSo you are misrepresenting the views of the majority of people on this sub, which includes me, and when I defend those views and correct your misrepresentation, you pretend I was being self centred because you cant actually address what I said. The only question I have here is: Why do you have to debate like such a fucking scumbag? Why cant you drop the gaslighting and manipulative tactics and just address my points?\n\n>So they know you are a good person.\n\nYou are so lost in the sauce you are now (accidentally I presume) saying that having people know that I am a good person is a bad thing. Like, freudian slip and all but a part of me thinks that subconsciously you know you are a piece of shit.\n\n>You don't even have stated aims.\n\nBoth I and the movement have stated aims and I am happy to go over them at any time with any one.\n\n>which I support\n\nNo you don't, and it has nothing to do with me hating you but we will get to that.\n\n>never critique the actions of the people who want the most horrible living conditions for the Palestinians\n\nThat would literally be Israel and Israelis, but I'm going to presume you mean Hamas and respond to that as an accusation instead. Hamas is one single party of many that makes up the resistance in its entirety. This includes at least 2 left wing parties: The PFLP and a communist party. I fully support these parties as a leftist myself. As it stands, both of these parties have released statements saying that despite fighting against Hamas in the past, and sharing the same criticisms you do of them, they have decided to fight alongside them against Israel who they currently deem to be the bigger threat to their existence. As an actual ally of Palestinians, I support and understand their decision.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to what you do, which is completely ignore the wishes of the Palestinians you claim to support, and use this as an opportunity to hyper-fixate on, and endlessly criticise Hamas despite them not being the biggest current threat to Palestinians, and also actually fighting on the side of good currently, while also pretending they make up the entirety of the resistance. Basically doing the work for pro Israeli propagandists. Not only that but when you do criticise Hamas, instead of legitimate criticisms, you repeat bullshit you heard for Israeli propagandists such as Hamas hanging gay people off buildings, which isn't even true and has been debunked as misinformation that was spread online using videos that were actually of ISIS. So you are so islamophobic that you took such a serious allegation as that at face value because \"yeah it's probably something they would do\". This is abhorrent and you should honestly be ashamed of yourself for coming in so half baked, not knowing what you are talking about, and then projecting that on to people like me.\n\n>doesn't actually do anything\n\nLiterally doing nothing would be better than what you do which is the heavy lifting for Israeli propagandists.\n\n>\u00a0I literally have had Jewish friends in the last year confide in me that this is the worst it's ever been for their families.\n\nWell I was marching with jews in the rallies every Sunday and they managed to not make it about them, so I'm guessing that you are talking about jewish zionists that cant help but make themselves the victim every chance they get...but lets say for a second that they are actually victims of rising antisemitism. Who's fault would that be? The state currently carrying out heinous acts in the Middle East that says they do it in the name of judaism? If antisemitism is on the rise in the west, which it probably is, then its exactly what Israel wants, because it means a higher chance of jews leaving their countries and going to Israel to further their colonial agenda.\n\n>\n\n>This never used to happen. It's getting worse and ya'll just stick your fingers in your ears.\n\nYou are correct here, I'm not interested in zionists trying to claim that they are in fact the real victims of a genocide being carried out by Israel.",
