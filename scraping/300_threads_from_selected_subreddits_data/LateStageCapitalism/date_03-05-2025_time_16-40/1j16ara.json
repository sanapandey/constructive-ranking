Russia isn't in any way an aggressor in this conflict. Particularly Putin spent over a decade trying to prevent it and wanted to force peace negotiations a mere 2 months after it started only for the US to keep escalating it (with the full support of its collaborators in Europe).",

Quite obviously and undeniably.\n\n>Or because they know Russia very well?\n\nThey don't know Russia at all. They are, in fact, completely misinformed about Russia... as you would know if you ever talked with anyone from those countries who dislikes Russia.\n\n>When China steals islands from other countries in the Pacific why do you not define that as imperialism?\n\nChina doesn't steal islands from other countries. Man, you don't just believe Western propaganda bullshit about Russia but every target of American disinformation, huh?\n\n>When Russia uses false flag attacks to justify Putin's invasion of Chechnya why do you not define that as imperialism?\n\nBecause it's just a defensive reaction to US imperialism in Chechnya (the unrest in Chechnya itself being almost entirely a product of American imperialism) and, again, the very existence of Russia as an independent country is a consequence of US imperialism.\n\nhttps://reliefweb.int/report/russian-federation/chechens-fear-wahhabi-threat\n\nAll seeds of unrest were implanted by the US and continue to be fanned at the detriment of actual locals, much like in the case of Xinjiang whom face similar issues with Wahhabi sects directly in conflict with local Islamic tradition and customs.

Both Israel and the US and NATO are all universally worse than Russia in every way, even if all the lies you believe about Russia were true.\n\nSo, quick question: Is Israel committing genocide and do you support the BDS movement? Do you condemn the state of Israel and its supporters and support the sending of weapons to Palestine? How about the US and NATO?\n\nLet's hear how much you *really* care about war crimes and genocide.\n\nPrediction: Zero percent. You just support anti-Russian war and genocide and also fully support the wars and genocides committed all around the world by the US, Israel, and NATO.\n\n>Meanwhile Ukraine is blowing up fuel depots and factories. (not schools and hospitals)\n\nUkraine has been bombing Ukrainian civilians and committing terrorist attacks against civilians in Russia.",

Since then, Ukraine has actively worked to distance the regiment from any extremist ties, and the current leadership denies any neo-Nazi connections.\n\nOkay, so now Ukraine's National Guard is infested with Nazis and you are falling for a new marketing strategy.\n\nIt's hilarious how you think Nazis using propaganda to pretend they are no longer Nazis means they are no longer Nazis. \n\n>Edit: I see the Russian operatives are trying to bury this comment, which contains factual information that anyone can look up for themselves. You can bury my comment, but you can't bury the truth.\n\nSpreading unhinged conspiracy theories only proves that you are either an American operative or a useful idiot who fell for the propaganda spread by American operatives.",

Just recently I've started looking into the history of the area. \n\nGlorification of Quisling paramilitary forces is something that is a phenomenon in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. After the disillusion of Yugoslavia, the things that were looked down upon since 1945 were whitewashed and made into heroic events. The Nazis fled across the Balkans into Vienna, taking their collaborators with them. Tito and the Partisans asked for the allies to repatriate these collaborators to the Yugoslav forces, and as they did, the Partisans had military tribunals and executed criminals as they went along. The Partisans then buried the bodies in graves, unknown as to not create memorials for fascists. \n\nToday, Croatian fascists celebrate this openly in both Croatia and Bosnia. \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleiburg\\_repatriations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleiburg_repatriations)\n\nSerbian quislings do the same with the Cetnik formations. Tito's communist government actively persecuted and executed the members as Nazi collaborators in the 1945s. History books have always portrayed Partisans as being anti-fascists and others as fascist adjacent. Tito also gave amnesty to both Ustashe and Cetnik members during the conflict. A lot of them had nationalist leanings and pointed fingers at their former colleagues to be executed so their nationalist feelings could remain hidden. \n\n  \nI'm sure that the events that took place in Ukraine in 1933-34 and repression of Eastern European governments in not setting up Truth and reconciliation committees is allowing Nazis and nationalists to rewrite history to their benefit.  \n\nNo one is immune to this.",
