Sure at times it was more simmering under the surface, but it's always been there. They had a fucking civil war over slavery. And then they had Jim Crow.\n\nWhile most of the West moved away from religion, they built empires of mega-churches preaching vile evangelism. Preaching the \"prosperity gospel\", which is pure bullshit used to denigrate the poor, ill and disabled. \n\nThey have sponsored coups of democratically elected leaders for decades. They made sure that Central and South America could never \"challenge\" them. \n\nAnti-intellectualism isn't new in the US either. No other western country seems to be so happy to ban and burn books.\n\nThey waited until they were attacked to join WW2 and then go on and on about how they saved everyone. \n\nThey started and pushed the war on drugs, which has been a complete failure. In the UK we had a good model going, but we were forced to stop it by the US. Funnily enough, drug use and drug deaths rose steadily after that...\n\nThey repressed socialist movements (very democratic), hiring private security companies (the Pinkertons) as strike breakers. These strike breakers executed people. \n\nThey bullshitted about WMDs to start a pointless war on terror that achieved basically nothing.\n\nThen there's the treatment of Native Americans. \n\nThe list goes on and on.\n\nNo country is perfect, but the US propaganda machine has done such a good job at painting them as the good guys, when they never have been.\n\nI'd ask people, what exactly are they proud of? Even the revolutionary war was about wealthy capitalists and slave owners. Most of the founding fathers were not nice people.\n\nFuck the US, the mask is off but none of this is new (see the business plot).",
