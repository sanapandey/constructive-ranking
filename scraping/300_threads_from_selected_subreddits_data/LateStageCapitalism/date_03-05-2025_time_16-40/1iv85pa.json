The communist party in China has supported anti-racist propaganda since the Mao Zedong era, where China was very eager to get support from other countries.\n\nNowadays, racism in China against black people is considerably reduced, since there is many economical projects of China with \u00c1frica, that put \u00c1frica on the news of the country, and give chances for people from both countries to visit each other.\n\nAnd the Xi Jimping goverment is the most african friendly goverment since Mao Zedong. One thing that western midia wont tell is that the first travel of Xi Jimping to another country while being president, after his first election, was to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Thats right, his first diplomatic visit was to an african country, tell me a single american president, or even any european PM or president that did something like this? To give diplomatic priority to an small, underdeveloped, poor african country as your first international political visit?\n\nRacism in China is much less of a problem then in western countries, and it shows in many ways. Recently, the ex-president of my country, Dilma Rouseff, that worked for some time recently as president of the BRICS bank, received the highest honors a foreigner can get in China, as an reward for her work on the bank. \n\nDilma is a brasillian woman, and she is more respected in China then in her own country, where reactionaries have slandered her since she became the first female president of my country.\n\nChina is less racist then every single western country, because it does not support any structural racism on its society, and because their government treats other countries as equals, instead of rivals or prey, independent of continent of origin, or color of the skin.",
