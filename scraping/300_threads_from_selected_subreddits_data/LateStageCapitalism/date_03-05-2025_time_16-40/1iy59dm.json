    "selftext": "Update 2/26: Thank you so much to everyone and your sincere, thought out responses. Honestly I was expecting to get chewed out for this question but y'all have been super supportive and it's helpful to hear so many different perspectives, especially from ppl in the same boat. \n\nMy dad is in his 70s, and a lifelong Republican and Trump supporter, living comfortably retired in a wealthy suburb. He's the definition of a reactionary boomer, takes all the culture war bait, and is fully incapable of even imagining a world outside of capitalism. Decades of neoliberal propaganda have had their intended effect on him. He claims to be well informed because he \"also watches CNN, not just Fox News\".\n\nTo be clear, I'm not seeking any advice on improving our relationship, or how to change his whole ideology. That's outside the scope of this sub and I'm not trying to trauma dump.\n\nWhat I would like though, is simply to make him confront the implications of his choices and beliefs. Even just making him uncomfortable for a bit would feel like a win honestly. And I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a part of me that is still hopeful I can move the needle on something. \n\nSo I'm seeking movie & documentary suggestions that lay plain the horrors of our world. Even if he learns nothing from them, maybe they will keep him up at night. I think I have the leverage to get him to watch some with me, because he is upset that I never call him, lol.\n\nAlternatively, is this just a waste of time? Aside from recs, I'm curious if anyone here can relate, and how people have coped with having fascist parents. ",

I'd rather have a blue collar worker who has never been to college but has been on the wrong side of power dynamics in our country in office as opposed to someone who has been to college and is super privileged. \n\nConservatives in general have a greater mistrust in the government than liberals.

I live in Miami and when I hear my retired mom and her ridiculous friends talking and giving advice it sounds like Marie Antoinette. If people vote for trump because they have some naive, idealistic hope this country isn\u2019t gonna crash and burn like the failing empire it is\u2026 ok. If they are defending war criminals like Zelensky and Bibi, that\u2019s another story. \n\nYour dad sounds like he is part of the PMC (professional managerial class). So many people in the US lived well and were successful simply because this country took the wealth of other nations and manipulated global markets to our advantage. That\u2019s it. There was no real merit, no real breakthroughs, no real skills and in turn these people that are in their 50-90s have no real advice or knowledge they can impart. How many white Americans speak multiple languages? Play instruments? Know plumbing, woodworking, electricity, mechanical work, cooking, baking, gardening? Programming? If they have one of these skills they don\u2019t have any other. They can\u2019t do anything for themselves, they have to hire other people to do it.

This is why boomers, elites and liberals simply don\u2019t want to look at the reality. It\u2019s a psychologically draining and demoralizing thing to face.
