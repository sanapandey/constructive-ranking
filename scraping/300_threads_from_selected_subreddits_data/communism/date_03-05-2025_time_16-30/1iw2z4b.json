    "selftext": "Hi y'all, does anyone have any recommendations for books about this? I realize this is kind of a broad topic and I'm interested in all of it, but I'm mostly talking about how western environmentalism kind of offloads environmental destruction onto poorer countries. I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit to ask about this. But I'm really open to any other books tangentially related you might want to recommend too. ",

            "body": "\n*** \n\nModerating takes time. You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-Marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to Marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or Marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/communism) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

            "body": "So this is a special interest area of mine. My recommendations for more general overviews are (in order of relevance, in my opinion):\n\nRob Nixon's Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor. \n\nAndreas Malm and the Zetkin Collective: White Skin, Black Fuel: on the Dangers of Fossil Fascism.\n\nMartin Arboleda's Planetary Mine: Territories of Extraction Under Late Capitalism\n\nGeoff Mann and Joel Wainwright Climate Leviathan: A Political Theory of Our Planetary Future. \n\nDominic Boyer's Energopolitics: Wind and Power in the Anthropocene (only partially related but I think this is available open access as an e-book).\n\nBikrum Gill's The political ecology of colonial capitalism: Race, nature, and accumulation (probably should be higher on the list but I haven't read this yet)\n\nPaul Robbin's Political Ecology: A Critical Introduction\n\nI also want to recommend a documentary called Arica (it doesn't have a structural analysis so feel free to ignore this). It's the case study of a Swedish Mining firm (Boliden) that dumped a load of toxic waste in the desert in Chile in the 1980s. It's completely horrific.",

She touches on how devastation from environmental changes disproportionately impacts poorer countries/communities but it\u2019s more focused on causes and solutions than on that aspect in particular.",
