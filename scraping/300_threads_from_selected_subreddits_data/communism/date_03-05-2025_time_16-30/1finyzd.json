    "selftext": "While I was reading about the restoration of capitalism and subsequent disintegration of the Soviet Union I began pondering how this event can be reconciled with the theory of Soviet social-imperialism. What I'm most confused about is the class character of the Russian bourgeoisie during the period of the 1990s and perhaps 2000s and the government of Boris Yeltsin.\n\nThat old Soviet ministers, administrators and managers took advantage of their already privileged positions to take private ownership of former socialist property is clear to me and also how Great Russian nationalism and petty-nationalisms were used as tools to advance this privatization process but it seems that after the disintegration a big rift arose between segments of the Russian bourgeoisie. If we are to analyse it through the prism of social-imperialism theory then the old Soviet administrators already constituted a monopolist imperialist bourgeoisie that was slowly dismantling and subverting the planned socialist system until final dissolution when it proved feasible and an impediment for massive profiteering.\n\nMy question is therefore what explains how a segment of the Russian bourgeoisie, apparently supported by Boris Yeltsin and his cronies, behaved during this period. It seems to me that Yeltsin and the bourgeoisie supportive of him (the most prominent were called semibankirschina) behaved a lot like a comprador and bureaucratic bourgeoisie and not an imperialist bourgeoisie as they seemingly subordinated themselves to US and European imperialists and allowed not only the national economy to be dismantled but also the state/political sphere of influence of Russia to disintegrate. When Putin and his supporters gained political power this process seems to have been partially reversed with expropriations, nationalizations and renewed imperialist wars, many members of the old bourgeoisie were also liquidated, exiled or even killed. This process seems to have intensified around 2008 and was massively accelerated in the current war as most foreign capital exited the country and constant capital was distributed among members of the Russian bourgeoisie.\n\nSo is it correct to analyse this as a case of a comprador and bureaucratic bourgeoisie forming itself inside a collapsing imperialist power? To the members of this class therefore subordination to US and European imperialists would not be a bad thing, as it would be an opportunity for greater profiteering for them to the detriment of the rest of the population. With Putin and his supporters rising to power it seems the imperialist bourgeoisie gained the upper hand and either exterminated the comprador bureaucratic bourgeoisie or forced them to toe the line. Now it would seem this group either no longer exists or is very weakened.\n\n",

            "body": "This is just a prettied up form of \"geopolitics.\" The bourgeoisie acts in the way it does because it is compelled to by capitalism. Nationalist/Comprador are not choices, they are objective class positions created by capitalism, and only exist through the everyday decisions of individual capitalists to produce commodities at a profit. Any display of economic planning, long term class perspective, or \"geopolitical\" strategy on the part of the bourgeoisie is an illusion: capitalism has its own autonomous logic which is unstoppable. Imperialism necessarily drives its agents to inter-imperialist conflict in which one or both will perish which is obviously irrational from the perspective of their self interest. Otherwise historical change is either impossible or the result of stupidity by the ruling class, which seems to be the problem you're running into.\n\n>the old Soviet administrators already constituted a monopolist imperialist bourgeoisie that was slowly dismantling and subverting the planned socialist system\n\nNo, the system was dismantling itself. It was fundamentally dysfunctional because production for profit and economic planning are incompatible. The bourgeoisie in the position of ownership in this system acted as imperialists when Soviet capitalism functioned in a monopolistic way (when the wealth of the socialist period was commodified) and ceased to act in that way when they did not (when that wealth dried up). \n\n>It seems to me that Yeltsin and the bourgeoisie supportive of him (the most prominent were called semibankirschina) behaved a lot like a comprador and bureaucratic bourgeoisie and not an imperialist bourgeoisie as they seemingly subordinated themselves to US and European imperialists and allowed not only the national economy to be dismantled but also the state/political sphere of influence of Russia to disintegrate.\n\nFor all the bluster about the \"dismantling\" and \"disintegration\" of Russia, the economy ended up not that different than China's so-called \"controlled\" marketization. This is why Dengists have no answer when \"maga communists\" argue that Putin's Russia is socialist except that he is politically reactionary and therefore don't think about it too hard. As Putin usefully pointed out, it was only Lenin's incomprehensible decision (from the perspective of the bourgeoisie) to support national self-determination that prevented the Russian communist party from accomplishing what the Chinese and Belarusans were able to do, but one should also not underestimate the extreme violence and impoverishment that came with Chinese capitalist restoration.\n\n>When Putin and his supporters gained political power this process seems to have been partially reversed with expropriations, nationalizations and renewed imperialist wars, many members of the old bourgeoisie were also liquidated, exiled or even killed. This process seems to have intensified around 2008 and was massively accelerated in the current war as most foreign capital exited the country and constant capital was distributed among members of the Russian bourgeoisie.\n\nPutin inherited an economy that had gone through a decade of austerity and therefore was primed for capitalist economic growth. It also benefited from the resource boom of China becoming the workshop of the world. Putin is only really tapping into that wealth now because Russian capitalism is again in crisis. For all the confident predictions about the genius of Putin's strategic vision and the meritocratic features of its political system, it has been unsuccessful, and Putin's political visions are merely an ideological response to the objective crisis of Russian capitalism today.",

Dengists like to point out the supposed cleanliness, efficiency of state apparatus, public transportation and high wages of China's most profitable industries (although from my experience it is Chinese nationalists who make this comparison as Westerners genuinely has no clue about Thailand) of Tier 1 cities vs Bangkok while conveniently forgetting impoverished rural areas or the Northeast rust belt. I also would like to add that I also went to Seoul back in 2015 and I'm pretty much not impressed by it.\n\n> For all the confident predictions about the genius of Putin's strategic vision\n\nIs there any reason why Afrikan bourgeois nationalists never mention Park Chung-hee as opposed to Lee Kuan Yew despite they were both leaders of the \"Asian Tigers\"? Or maybe a thorough study of him show that he wasn't really different than Idi Amin or Bokassa? Or Lee was just happened to be English-speaking and more charismatic than Park?",

The article by MIM below also elucidated the question for me a great deal.\n\nI suppose what motivated this incorrect analysis was the apparent greater depth of Russia's capitalist crisis in the 1990's which resulted in such widespread immiseration that gdp per capita fell below that of Brazil and nearly 6 million died as a result from various causes, specially pensioners who were simply left to rot with nothing to sustain themselves. I believe it was Utsa Patnaik who made an estimation but I can't remember in which work.\n\nBut indeed, this only seems unique by underestimating the effects of capitalist restoration in China, which may have been similar or even worse. Perhaps no greater studies have been made on this due to suppression by the revisionists still in power and whatever came out of western academia would be of dubious veracity. But overall there are plenty indicators to showcase the extent of degradation to the Chinese masses that came with capitalist restoration such as the Malthusian One Child Policy, that now the party is desperately attempting to reverse the effects of to no good results, the misery in the rural regions brought about by the reversal of collectivization, the end of job security and the \u201ciron rice bowl\u201d leading to massively increased work exploitation and insecurity leading to alienating social conditions.\n\nAs to marketization and how it is essentially commodification of wealth created during the socialist period, you mentioned that at one point it dried up and the Soviet bourgeoisie stopped acting as imperialists. Do you mean by this that the subsequent Russian capitalism no longer functioned in a monopolistic way and the bourgeoisie stopped having the capability of acting imperialist? Did they regain this capability since then or are they merely attempting to do so by recreating Russian imperialist monopoly capitalism and failing? This is confusing to me because the most revolutionary organizations and nearly all anti-revisionists in the world all refer to China and Russia as imperialists and the only way I can make sense of this is by concluding the resources and wealth created through socialist economic planning allowed them to become imperialist powers after capitalist restoration.",

Russian nationalists could have called forward an irredentist movement of the Russians in the various republics. To some extent, that option does still exist and is causing tension in the ex-Soviet bloc.\n\nWell this article seems to have been published in the mid 2000s so how predictive of MIM(Prisons).\n\nI think the article in general also shows that though the dissolution of the USSR was a tragic victory of nationalism, this victory had in fact happened long before 1991 and the alternative would have just been a new Russian Empire. That is not to say one would be preferable over the other of course; I lean towards saying there is no cheer in either the splintering of the Soviet proletariat into 15 parts, nor in its \"unity\" under Great Russian chauvinism. But the article seems to say Lenin in fact disagrees with this and that one of the purposes of the Soviet nationality policy was to create a fetter to the resurgence of Great Russian chauvinism / the Russian Empire even if capitalism was restored. I don't know.\n\nThe article also gives a further perspective for why Russian nationalists feel an affinity for the \"Soviet Union\" (in reality, post-Stalin Soviet revisionism and capitalism; the co-option of Stalin into the mythology of a continuity between the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union \"after Stalin got rid of those Jewish internationalist Bolsheviks\" is of course mostly ideological rather than based in the reality of Stalinism as a practice) and why revisionist communists find an affinity for overt Russian capitalism. I've held the belief (don't remember if I've voiced it online before though) that it is understandable that Brezhnevite or crypto-Khrushchevite revisionists and Russian nationalists would find an affinity for each other given the nature of the post-Stalin USSR (the fact that it was capitalist, and perhaps also the fact that, while not a revitalized Russian Empire just yet as I don't think this was ever fully realized and the article seems to agree with me, the restoration of capitalism was a step towards it) but this gives a deeper perspective into that.\n\n> To some extent, the old Soviet-wide labor aristocracy realizes it has suffered the most. Those who were merely petty-bourgeois under the old system have lost their class status.\n\nIn my personal experience this is often true. A lot of the impetus of \"Soviet nostalgia\" comes from the kinds of people who were privileged petit-bourgeoisie or bureaucrats under Soviet capitalism but who lost parts of their status, or the entirety of it, post-dissolution. There are also certain sections of the labor aristocracy in post-Soviet countries other than Russia that seem to have an affinity for \"communism\" and the \"Soviet Union\", although most of them instead have an affinity for NATO imperialism (as does a lot of the Russian labor aristocracy tbh -- _In fact, the strongholds of the Russian labor aristocracy in Moscow and Leningrad became bastions of Liberalism._ -- from the article).\n\nSomewhat tangential -- I also found this comment on the political economy of militarism interesting:\n\n> In the united $tates we have several times more barbaric economics. Bypassing Marx and retreating past Ricardo, most calling themselves socialist, communist or even pro-capitalist do not consider the growth of the unproductive sector of the economy parasitic. It's in that sort of economy that systematic parasitism ties itself to an ideology for war on a regular basis--militarism. This is a militarism not of the violent ejecting an occupier once in a while, but a regular ideology of violence, as a way of life.\n\nKarl Liebknecht once wrote a work analyzing militarism. I haven't read it yet but I wonder if it contains a similar analysis.\n\nFinally,\n\n> Gorbachev on his part pointed to referenda and polls showing general three quarters support for keeping a centralized union.\n\nFunny how this is exactly what modern Dengists do when talking about \"the illegal dissolution of the Soviet Union\". Now I know where that comes from. Revisionists must have once seen Gorbachev as a hero trying to preserve the USSR (while capitalist in essence, of course).",

I think it's easier to identify a petit bourgeois and labor aristocrat than a proletarian because I'm acquainted with those classes and their politics enough to quickly see the tell-tale signs, and I also think that out of all the post-Soviet people with some proletarian character I've interacted with, many are probably at least partially petit bourgeois, or labor aristocratic, or whatever else. Perhaps this is an issue I face due to living in Cyprus and due to being of the middle classes myself; while I may have some access to people from post-Soviet countries due to personal connections, visits I've made, the internet, and their migration to Cyprus, I think ultimately your question can only be answered by communists actually living in post-Soviet countries who do a deep enough analysis of the capitalist society of each of these countries, because then at least they will know what the most revolutionary elements of post-Soviet societies are and they can investigate what these people think. A further problem is, I'm not really aware of proper communists in post-Soviet countries in the first place (despite trying very hard to find them with the resources I have), nevermind being aware of them producing such works. I had some hope when I heard of the Maoist Party of Russia but they don't seem very active and have a dogshit stance on Palestine so I'm not too hopeful about them providing answers to such questions.",

                    "body": "Thanks for linking the article, it's a much better analysis. I believe MIM is correct to point to the national bourgeoisie in the republics as being the key factor in the dissolution and not a comprador character of Yeltsin and other members of the Soviet/Russian bourgeoisie. This section specifically elucidated the question for me:\n\n>The various nationalities were not going to favor a crackdown to keep the Soviet Union together --at least not in the Central Committee or Politburo of the Soviet social- imperialists. In this sense we can even say that the small nationalities \"got their way,\" especially from the point of view of the self-legalizing mafia classes of the republics. The national conflicts came at the expense of the Soviet proletariat, which had the nationalist virus that the bourgeoisie took advantage of to divide the workers and restore open capitalism.\n\n>Against MIM on this question, of course are the non-Leninists. If we do not accept as Lenin did that achieving finance capitalism and monopoly capitalism are the marks of imperialism, then the rest of this argument will make no sense. **Here we only argue about diversity within those countries having achieved finance capitalism. That diversity of imperialist countries stems from the level of surplus-value, the land question, the war defeats and the imperialists' first choice of alliance partner-- the bourgeoisie of the republics in the Soviet case.** \n\nMy only question about the article is about this claim:\n\n>When we look at Russian imperialists in the Soviet Union, Lenin left an important legacy. In taking down the tsarist empire, Lenin sowed some seeds ensuring that the Russian nation would not face certain other nationalities in a typical colonial conflict.\n\n>**He could have insisted from the beginning that there is only one Soviet nation with all people treated the same way everywhere. Stalin pushed in that direction, but never achieved single nationhood for the USSR.** Thus the government and party structure of the Soviet Union after [Stalin](https://www.prisoncensorship.info/archive/etext/faq/stalin.html) contained a seed from Lenin.\n\nDo you know of any writings by Stalin were this proposition is articulated clearly? I admit this somewhat surprised me and seems to contradict most of what I read by him and his work on the national question in the former Russian Empire. Are they referring to here to the distinction he makes between national autonomy and regional autonomy in Marxism and the National Question? If that's the case I don't agree that he envisioned one Soviet nation with all people treated the same way everywhere, it does not align with what Stalin means by regional autonomy which he stresses:\n\n>Thus, equal rights of nations in all forms (language, schools, etc.) is an essential element in the solution of the national question. Consequently, a state law based on complete democratization of the country is required, prohibiting all national privileges without exception and every kind of disability or restriction on the rights of national minorities. That, and that alone, is the real, not a paper guarantee of the rights of a minority.\n\nI also am unsure what period of Soviet history they are referring to here, would it pre or post collectivization? This is important when discussing this and the feasibility/desirability of the \"withering\" of the SSRs.",
