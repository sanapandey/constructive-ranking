    "selftext": "52 Years ago, on September 21, 1972 (depending on your time zone it may be September 20 for you), the fascist, US backed dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos Sr. declared Martial Law as a means of eliminating, subjugating, and oppressing the \"communist threat\" in the Philippines. \n\nThere were proclamations that it would be a short lived measure, that the national government had it's head on its body and it's morals intact; they were as a matter of fact not. Since when has a fascist American lapdog ever been on the same interests of the working class? \n\nThe Martial Law lasted until 1982, with Marcos Sr. sitting on his throne until 1986 when a peaceful, yet still US backed revolution, deposed him and his corrupt family. \n\nDuring his dictatorahip, billions of dollars were plundered and funnelled into international bodies. Well over 3,250 people were murdered with political motivations, 35,000 were tortured, 737 went missing as they went on to be called deseparecidos, and well over 70,000 people were incarcerated without due process. \n\nThe Marcoses and the subsequent administrations tried to wipe the revolution off from the Philippine map, but their resolve persisted up until this day. \n\nAs it stands, the dictators son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is now the 2nd Marcos in the Philippine presidency, and despite his promises of peace between the local communists/leftists (i.e. the CPP-NPA, NDF and Makabayan Bloc), their persistent red tagging and killings live on in this nation. \n\n#NeverForget\n#NeverAgain\n\n\n\nEdit: the Peaceful Revolution of 1986 was not simply brought upon by the struggles of Corazon Aquino and her proximate establishment allies. Years of activist struggle, protests and rallies against Marcos Sr. prompted the ball to start rolling as notable figures such as Edgar Jopson, and Liliosa Hilao sacrificed their lives to further the cause against the Marcos Regime.

            "body": "\n*** \n\nModerating takes time. You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Nakasalalay sa masa at ang kanilang tiwala, na mangyayari lang kung tama ang ating theory at practice. Kaya nga nag 2nd rectification para malaman kung ano ang nangyari noong EDSA 1 at paano tayo ulit matagumpay. Kaya nga ngayon may 3rd rectification, paulit-ulit na self-criticism, dahil kailangan natin ang tiwala ng masa, na magagaling lang sa tamang theory at practice.\n\n///\n\nFor the casual reader, the point here being our success and failure in revolution is not due to the intervention of foreigners but in the weakness of our movement that failed to strengthen itself and win enough support and trust from the masses to combat whatever they may throw at us.\n\nWhether it is the U$, Chinese, Japanese, or our own comparadors, it is ultimately the Filipino who must reckon with themselves and derive the correct analysis and practice. Moreover, the movement must win genuine trust and support of the masses which can only be done through self-criticism. Thankfully this has and continues to happen as evidenced by the 2nd and 3rd rectification, but much work remains to be done if we are to see eventual success.",
