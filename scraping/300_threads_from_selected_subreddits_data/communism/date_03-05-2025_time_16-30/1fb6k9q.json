    "selftext": "I have discovered several fascist (or fascist-inspired) accounts that define social class as \"spiritual\". They hold that ideas are the driver of history, and thus the great men and the tribes are the player of history. They dismissed materialism as \"nihilistic\". In my mind, I do know that analyzing history by uncovering material relations are not as glorious and fire-raging as simple as \"history are stories of great men conquering land of x, look at him riding the horse while his brave soldiers are riding the cavalry towards the gun fire of the enemies of our people!\", but I am certain that you shouldn't base your political system out of pure romanticism.\n\nNot only that, this kind of \"romanticist idealist tendency\" is also present in many non-fascist right-wing traditions, from ancaps who idealize petty-bourgeoisie-dominated early capitalism where there is no corporate monopoly (but capitalism it is), to right-wing traditionalists who idealize the rejunevation of nations (sometimes in a romanticist and populist way).\n\nI've met this kind of folks, and some of them are open to critiques, but some of them defend their ideas to death (without replying to critiques).\n\nI feel like these type of folks are definitely disilusioned folks that have their eyes covered by \"history are conflicts of ideas\", stopping them from uncovering the true material relations of society. Not only that, a lot of them are petty-bourgeoisie. I myself am a petty-bourgeoisie, is there any idea on how to stop the petty-bourgeoisie from being \"too counter-revolutionary\" ? Because from what I've read, petty bourgeoisie formed the voter base of the interwar fascist movements.",

            "body": "Fascism is idealist by definition, since it necessarily depends on the dehumanization, by one form or another, of broad swathes (usually the vast majority) of humanity, a purely arbitrary condemnation with no material basis whatsoever (apart from, of course, that of the material interests of the fascist). It also usually depends on the idealist conception of a nation as being a transhistorical entity with certain \"values\", totally at odds with the Marxist materialist understanding of nation. Of course, none of this is actually unique to fascism itself: it also characterizes more \"mainstream\" liberalism, which is also founded on a base of pure idealism and is likewise entirely racist. Of course, this reflects the fact that fascism and liberalism are ideologies of the petty and haute bourgeoisie, which can only justify their exploiter class positions through recourse to so-called \"nature\".\n\nAlso, preventing the petty-bourgeoisie from becoming \"too counter-revolutionary\" is impossible, at least in the material conditions of the imperial core. In oppressed nations the petty-bourgeoisie can be vaccilitating and brought into the revolutionary movement (if with some reservations), but oppressor-nation petty-bourgeois (such as the aforementioned fascists) have class-interests entirely against materialism, communism, and human liberation. As a rule, classes will not betray their class interests; individuals within those classes can, but they are very rare and are produced by contradictions and pressures acting on the individual, not the class as a whole. These fascists, even if they cease being open fascists and slip into more \"respectable\" liberal fascism, will almost certainly never become principled communists. The most you can do, as a petty-bourgeois, is to become a principled communist yourself and come to understand the objective limits of the petty-bourgeoisie as a class for the revolutionary cause.",

If you explain the present, and predict the future, by referring only to material reality and its evident past, you are forced to find certain things to be true: force is proportionate to an object's mass and acceleration; natural selection adapts living things to their environments; America lost a war to Vietnam; the law of the tendential fall in the rate of profit makes capitalism unsustainable; and so forth.\n\nIs it not possible for something to be incorrect but also not idealist? It seems odd on its face to claim that one is _forced_ to find certain things true simply by using a materialist method.\n\nAs I understand it, it is not so much that one becomes _forced_ to find certain things to be true, but that a scientific, materialist approach to examining and understanding any given phenomenon will eventually lead to the correct conclusion. This is because with this method, reality operates as a yardstick by which the accuracy of one \"model\" may be tested against the other and, since _truth_ is that model that most accurately represents the \"inner content\" of reality at a given time, repeated instances of this approach, with new approaches being informed by the failures of previous ones, are bound to make this model more accurate. Another way I see it is that reality acts as a _selective pressure_ by which truth is gradually discovered, though its efficiency in this process requires total dedication to the materialist method.",

With regards to the question of whether gods (take gods here to refer to any supposedly supernatural phenomena or entities) exist or not my answer has up to now been that it's not even an interesting question (the concept of interventionist gods isn't even a decent explanation of the world by a long shot and is thus wrong, and that of non-interventionist gods is untestable empirically as you said and thus cannot be said to be \"true\" in any decent sense of the word), but I've been increasingly unsatisfied with that answer because it seems to be avoiding the question. Maybe my quarrel is with the concept of \"belief\" as opposed to \"knowledge\".\n\n> Yes, but this is tautological - as \"correct\" can only be defined as the product of a scientific, materialist approach.\n\nI was going to specify that I meant that an _individual_ is not necessarily forced to find those things to be true even while using a scientific and materialist approach. I've since slept, but I decided not to say it because I didn't think you were necessarily referring to an individual when you said \"one becomes forced...\" and I didn't want to play the pedant. Obviously I should have revised the entire paragraph to adjust for this. Thanks for the correction, though, that _correct_ is a tautology in this case. It seems like a desirable definition of \"correctness\" to have but it still isn't intuitive to me.\n\n> It's not clear what you mean by \"model,\" as it can either mean a conception of reality or a mathematical formalization.

So you mean that the special theory of relativity in this case was \"necessarily the result of the contradictions within [classical mechanics]\"? I haven't yet done much reading on dialectics, but that even the overall direction of scientific inquiry should move in a dialectic manner seems like a tiny vindication of dialectical materialism in my head (I have read threads talking about it here, but maybe there's a difference between reading it and having something that comes out of my head actually corrected in real time. Alternatively I could just have slipped into passive reading until now).\n\nBy the way, do you consider this to be different from a mathematical formalization? I'm thinking of natural numbers, integers, and complex numbers right now and it seems to be very similar to your example of classical mechanics and the special theory of relativity.\n\n> Also, what is the \"inner content\" of reality?\n\nI basically meant the internal mechanics of reality, the way that reality works. The imagery in my head at the time was the innards of a human being which are not external to the human being but still dictate how the human being works. For me, reality, being the totality of all things, doesn't have any external elements that operate on it, and the concept of a human being is simply an abstraction of a particular pattern within reality.

The idealism is in the fact that science does show that our subjective impressions have an objective character.\n\n> With regards to the question of whether gods (take gods here to refer to any supposedly supernatural phenomena or entities) exist or not my answer has up to now been that it's not even an interesting question\n\nIt's an interesting question, it marks the break from idealism to materialism - and as such we need to be able to answer it, in order to justify the materialism in dialectical materialism.\n\n> the concept of interventionist gods isn't even a decent explanation of the world by a long shot and is thus wrong\n\nWhat do you mean? This concept explains everything - without exception. It is wrong because it contradicts materialism, not because we can find it to be inconsistent (e.g. the problem of evil has not been solved, at least not without an idealist view of freedom of will.)\n\n>  and that of non-interventionist gods is untestable empirically as you said and thus cannot be said to be \"true\" in any decent sense of the word\n\nI don't believe that something which cannot be empirically tested cannot be said to be true. For example, it's true that if I wasn't writing this as of now, I would be doing something else, but we can't test that. We can also show to be true certain things that are not testable and are not tautological, such as atheism.\n\n> I've been increasingly unsatisfied with that answer because it seems to be avoiding the question. Maybe my quarrel is with the concept of \"belief\" as opposed to \"knowledge\".\n\nThe problem is in your justification of materialism - it should necessarily imply that God doesn't exist. From what I've read, we deny the existence of God by tracing the genealogy of the concept and explaining its point of origin and subsequent developments. For example, according to Cornforth:\n\n> To believers, the conceptions of religion, that is to say, conceptions of supernatural spiritual beings, generally seem to have their justification, not, of course, in any evidence of the senses, but in something which lies deep within the spiritual nature of man. And, indeed, it is true that these conceptions do have very deep roots in the historical development of human consciousness. But what is their origin, how did such conceptions arise in the first place? We can certainly not regard such conceptions as being the products, as religion itself tells us, of divine revelation, or as arising from any other supernatural cause, if we find that they themselves have a natural origin. And such an origin can in fact be traced. Conceptions of the supernatural, and religious ideas in general, owe their origin first of all to the helplessness and ignorance of men in face of the forces of nature. Forces which men cannot understand are personified\u2014they are represented as manifestations of the activity of spirits.\n\n...\n\n> From the most primitive times men personified natural forces in this way. With the birth of class society, when men were impelled to act by social relations which dominated them and which they did not understand, they further invented supernatural agencies doubling, as it were, the state of society. The gods were invented superior to mankind, just as the kings and lords were superior to the common people.\n\n.\n\n> It seems like a desirable definition of \"correctness\" to have but it still isn't intuitive to me.\n\nBy \"scientific\" I really mean applied dialectical materialism. A methodology that does not consider things as they are or does not consider their interconnections and movement is incorrect.\n\n> Yeah I was referring to the former. So you mean that the special theory of relativity in this case was \"necessarily the result of the contradictions within [classical mechanics]\"?\n\nYes, but this is the case for every development. The development of Lagrangian mechanics is the consequence of contradictions within Newtonian mechanics, for example. I should have precised that it was the result of the contradictions inherent to the consideration that classical mechanics give to reality.\n\n> By the way, do you consider this to be different from a mathematical formalization?\n\nYes, a mathematical formalization is just the transcription of a conception of reality in mathematical language (this applies to mathematics too), and as such exists only after one. There are also sciences that did not embed their conception of reality in mathematics, like evolutionary biology.\n\n> I'm thinking of natural numbers, integers, and complex numbers right now and it seems to be very similar to your example of classical mechanics and the special theory of relativity\n\nYeah, the development of the complex numbers is a way better example, I'm a bit embarrassed I didn't think of that, haha. In general mathematics is always a good candidate if you want a clean and simple representation of dialectics.\n\n> I basically meant the internal mechanics of reality, the way that reality works.

A good portion of that time was spent dealing with the psychological shock (for lack of a better word) that came with and very quickly followed the reading this two particular segments:\n\n> It's an interesting question, it marks the break from idealism to materialism - and as such we need to be able to answer it, in order to justify the materialism in dialectical materialism.\n\n...\n\n> What do you mean? This concept explains everything - without exception. It is wrong because it contradicts materialism, not because we can find it to be inconsistent (e.g. the problem of evil has not been solved, at least not without an idealist view of freedom of will.)\n\nAlthough I didn't really come to a breakthrough for most of the portion of time spent genuinely thinking about what you said and only did so in the last 24 hours, I will be honest in saying that I was simultaneously troubled by the issue but also lacked diligence in pursuing a conclusion to it. In retrospect the source of this internal drama is obvious: I could not come to an immediate and _intuitive_ conclusion about the matter damaged my self-image as an \"atheist\", which was formed by interacting with the atheist communities of the mid to late 2010's on the internet and central to which was the fascistic belief of the \"intuitively irrational other\" and the \"intuitively rational self\", to be brief. Although I had nominally disavowed this standpoint a while ago, it's obvious that I hadn't sufficiently interrogated myself on the matter (and it is possible that I have not gone as far as I still can, hence my decision to risk personal embarrassment by publicly writing this instead of DMing you; my thought right now is that this will force me to be more diligent this time) and should have obviously just read more as I had initially assumed. That this breakthrough only came with reading up to Chapter 1.2 of Lenin's _Materialism and Empirio-criticism_ only reinforces my initial belief, and my fault is in not acting on it immediately. There is more that I could say here but all my attempts at extending this segment had been pointlessly lengthy excuses for my fascistic self-concept so I will stop here.\n\nAnyway, my previous confusion here was that I was thinking about _interventionist_ and _non-interventionist_ gods, or at least the ideas of them, in the sense of whether they were \"true\" descriptors of \"reality\" or not (by reality I mean the material world here, its mechanisms and manner of movement which is best understood as moving in a dialectal manner). More directly the problem was that \"I had no reason to completely dismiss the possibility of the existence of gods\", which is a more explicit articulation of my stance on the issue. This is in truth what was increasingly seeming to me an evasion of the problem, and, if my memory serves me well, my bit on it not being an \"interesting question\" was indeed an evasion that I had concocted when arguing with someone about the matter and not being able to break away from agnosticism. Your brief definition of agnosticism...\n\n> Agnosticism states that the difference between reality and its reflection in our consciousness is such that we cannot pretend to know reality, only it's reflection. The idealism is in the fact that science does show that our subjective impressions have an objective character.\n\n...was too sharp and direct for me to dismiss, and in my attempt to combat it I had begun to descend swiftly into solipsism, which was something that I had dismissed as narcissistic and insane a long time ago. That's not my reasoning for dismissing it now, though*. Just to cross-check, an example of what you are referring to would be the fact that we know exactly what portions of the brain are excited by objective visual or auditory stimuli, how the stimuli travels, the laws that dictate how this traversal works, and so on, right? In any case, as I understand it now, there is no non-philosophical consideration of the definition of \"truth\" itself, and my own use of the term was befuddled.\n\n> The problem is in your justification of materialism - it should necessarily imply that God doesn't exist. From what I've read, we deny the existence of God by tracing the genealogy of the concept and explaining its point of origin and subsequent developments. For example, according to Cornforth:\n\nI was aware of this then as well but it didn't serve me as enough of a reason to completely dismiss the idea of God existing. I was aware enough on Christian history to know that the historical developments of Christianity always seemed to tail some material development in whatever society it lived in, and I must have already read an excerpt of Cornforth's since the specific passage you quoted was familiar to me. The question this consideration necessarily brought to me was \"what is truth?\" or more acutely, \"given that we have assumed that our sensations are simply our reactions to physical and real objects and phenomena, what can we say about those objects and phenomena we have not discovered and have no current tools to discover?\", and more directly, \"how can we define a thing as true that we cannot test?\", though this latter question assumes already a definition of \"truth\" which I had not realized that I needed to interrogate. A \"static\" definition of truth was what I was seeking but the process of investigation is necessarily dynamic. I remember someone mentioning on this reddit that, to a Bedouin living 3000 years ago the world being flat could be considered \"true\". Perhaps this has something to do with that?\n\n> I feel like by \"internal mechanics of reality\" or \"inner content\" you're speaking about scientific laws, which is an abstraction of reality similar to the decomposition of human anatomy into organs.\n\nThat was what I was thinking of, I think. Incidentally, I think the reason why saying \"...that accurately represents reality at a given time\" was confusing to me was the conflation of \"truth\" and \"reality\" which I had taken as granted. That scientific laws are abstractions of reality seems like a natural conclusion of what you've said earlier.\n\nThanks for the response, although it was a good response in the more general sense I think it was given to me at the right place and the right time. Do you have any book recommendations on where to learn more specifically about the Marxist conception of truth and philosophy in general? Empirio-criticism has been more than helpful so far so I'll read it to completion first but I'm asking in case you have any other books in mind.\n\n----\n\n\\* My issue while writing that was in the justifications for individual conceptions of truth, but I realized that the presumption internal to that query was that truth is something that can simply be mused into existence without practice which is obviously idealist. It reminds me of a short blurb I had read about rationalism vis-a-vis empiricism. That's something that I haven't studied much though so I'll only mention it.",

                                                            "body": "> I was thinking about interventionist and non-interventionist gods, or at least the ideas of them, in the sense of whether they were \"true\" descriptors of \"reality\" or not.\n\nLike you point out later on, the issue is in our understanding of truth; it is not synonymous with reality. Given your background I guess that what's troubling you with the concept of non-interventionist gods is inherent to your \"purely logical\" approach that neglects reality. I'm sure you don't feel the same way about ghosts.\n\n> Just to cross-check, an example of what you are referring to would be the fact that we know exactly what portions of the brain are excited by objective visual or auditory stimuli, how the stimuli travels, the laws that dictate how this traversal works, and so on, right?\n\nNo. What I've said comes from the justification Lenin gives of materialism in MEC:\n\n> All knowledge comes from experience, from sensation, from perception. That is true. But the question arises, does objective reality \u201cbelong to perception,\u201d i.e., is it the source of perception? If you answer yes, you are a materialist. If you answer no, you are inconsistent and will inevitably arrive at subjectivism, or agnosticism, irrespective of whether you deny the knowability of the thing-in-itself, or the objectivity of time, space and causality (with Kant), or whether you do not even permit the thought of a thing-in-itself (with Hume). The inconsistency of your empiricism, of your philosophy of experience, will in that case lie in the fact that you deny the objective content of experience, the objective truth of experimental knowledge.\n>\n> Those who hold to the line of Kant or Hume (Mach and Avenarius are among the latter, in so far as they are not pure Berkeleians) call us, the materialists, \u201cmetaphysicians\u201d because we recognise objective reality which is given us in experience, because we recognise an objective source of our sensations independent of man. We materialists follow Engels in calling the Kantians and Humeans agnostics, because they deny objective reality as the source of our sensations. Agnostic is a Greek word: a in Greek means \u201cno,\u201d gnosis \u201cknowledge.\u201d The agnostic says: I do not know if there is an objective reality which is reflected, imaged by our sensations; I declare there is no way of knowing this (see the words of Engels above quoted setting forth the position of the agnostic). Hence the denial of objective truth by the agnostic, and the tolerance\u2014the philistine, cowardly tolerance\u2014of the dogmas regarding sprites, hobgoblins, Catholic saints, and the like.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1908/mec/two4.htm\n\n> I remember someone mentioning on this reddit that, to a Bedouin living 3000 years ago the world being flat could be considered \"true.\" Perhaps this has something to do with that?\n\nYes, it's a good example of what we're speaking about if we don't play around with the meaning of the word \"world.\" I remember the discussion that followed in the comments to be interesting, and since it's related to truth (and it's interaction to reality) you might be interested in reading it:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/1dupzmj/knowledge_and_truth/\n\n> Do you have any book recommendations on where to learn more specifically about the Marxist conception of truth and philosophy in general? Empirio-criticism has been more than helpful so far so I'll read it to completion first but I'm asking in case you have any other books in mind.\n\nI can recommend [Cornforth's trilogy and some essays by Mao](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/y0upon/how_does_antirevisionism_help_me_a_local_activist/is07139/) for Marxist philosophy (there's a decently sized part about science and truth in the third volume). This [list](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/spwg5q/a_collection_of_introductory_texts_on_marxist/) of works is also worth checking out, just to get an idea of what's out there. And I especially recommend you to read (in full) [*Dialectical Materialism*](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/spirkin/works/dialectical-materialism/index.html) by A. Spirkin \u2014 despite what it's title may imply it deals with more than dialectical materialism, and is extremely well written in my opinion, but that may be because I'm French.\n\nAs for philosophy, there's [*Fundamentals of Philosophy*](https://www.abertzalekomunista.net/images/Liburu_PDF/Internacionales/Spirkin_Alexander/Fundamentals_of_Philosophy_-K.pdf) by A. Spirkin, which I haven't read yet. There is a part about knowledge and truth that you might be interested in reading. \n\n> Thanks for the response, although it was a good response in the more general sense I think it was given to me at the right place and the right time.\n\nI'm glad you found it useful. :)",

As a materialist of some sort, in a sense, I agree, in that I don't believe humans and human society exists outside of nature. However, I don't believe in their idealist explanation of course, as it thoroughly ignores both the conditions and processes that create these hierarchical structures, as well as the fact that conditions are always in flux and changing and there is never a truly static \"way of being\" for humans and society.\n\n\nThis also brings to mind a fun contradiction of the reactionary mind, at least for some people, where they will on one hand dismiss the idea that structural racism, patriarchy, classism, the economic structure, and other real material and historically understandable things and such are a proper explanations for the violence and inequalities of society, while also blaming, for example, immigrants for their economic woes, which is also a material factor at play. Basically most any right wing complaint, even if it's not correct as a proper critique of what's to blame for whatever problem, is admitting that material conditions of society matter in affecting outcomes for individuals.",
