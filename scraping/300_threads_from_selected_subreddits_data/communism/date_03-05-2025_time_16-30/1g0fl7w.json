    "selftext": "Marx uses the term socially necessary labour. I know that there are 2 aspects of a commodity: qualitative and quantitative (exchange value).\n\nBut I am confused about the qualitative part because it\u2019s too abstract and I don\u2019t think there is a way to apply it into the real world. How can I find the socially necessary labour? Which society? Is it capitalist society or is it the country that the product was produced?",

There's nothing abstract about it, it's literally as physical as the phone or computer you made this post from. There's something going wrong in your reading process for this section (my assumption is that you're reading chapter 1 of Capital because that's where Marx explains this stuff). Why do you think you have to calculate the SNLT? What are you trying to do?",

The time taken to pick the cotton. Spin it to yarn. Make fabric. Sew it into a T shirt. \n\nSay industry has a sewing machine and before they have to replace it with a new one it makes 1000 T shirts. Then each T shirt contains 1/1000 T shirts worth of that labour time.\n\nAnd the calculation goes on like that. Taking into account all labour socially necessary. If it's socially necessary for a company competing in the market to pay advertisers or managers then all that time goes into all of the commodities produced.",

And he thought large scale industry was wonderful for increasing the total output of society.\n\nThe issue is that capitalists maximize profits. So they don't raise wages unless they have to. But at the same time they invest in machinery that increases output. The market causes small firms to go bust and the largest firms that can produce the most goods with as little labour as possible rise. \n\nThis means over time the supply of goods increases much faster than the money customers have to buy products. This leads to inevitable overproduction crisis that are disastrous for society. \n\nMarx believed industry could be planned in such a way as to eliminate these over production crisis and overall create a more productive society.",

            "body": "Well, I would suggest you read some of Paul cockshot and Alan cotrell's work on this, as they calculate labour inputs in the form of vectors, and see the standard deviation, and difference between said vectors. With regards to the ECP in particular, I suggest you guys read Paul cockshot's work on 'new socialism'. You can also read Viktor Magarino's paper on profit rate equalization (which I personally found very interesting, however this never really deals with the LTV directly, its a pretty hard read, however he makes a very, very compelling case, you can also check out both his and cockshots channels, where they explain it in more simpler terms, cockshot even goes as far as to reduce it to such simple terms, that anyone with a 11th grade level of economics, and someone with some basic understanding of Neo-classical economics, can easily grasp it), Osuna and Diaz have also written papers on what Paul cockshot discusses way back in the 80s and 90s, with regards to overcoming the labour vector units, through what is called a delflationary procedure (brought by Kliman), where both labour and non-labour values are not seen as a the only two factors at play, rather there is a third factor. Paul cockshot in particular responds to this criticism in his famous 2005 article ( [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23602188](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23602188) ), there are more mathematical methods and models (some which even use simple tools like Linear algebra), and cockshot himself has written several 100, peer reviewed, high quality article on this. Now of course regarding the scale and complexity issue (which was relatively dealt with by cockshot's new book, something which even the Mises institute recognized), I also found [https://users.wfu.edu/cottrell/eea97.pdf](https://users.wfu.edu/cottrell/eea97.pdf) this article from cockshott, and also Ekroot and Cover's work regarding conditional entropies (Brought up by cockshot), basically the randomness can be quantified by seeing them as entropies of trajectories, and then quantified using Markov processes. There is a lot more nuanced discussions regarding this, however these works should suffice. Now, there are some really simple methods to calculate socially necessary labour time, through a simple correlation s/v, but again, as seen in Unlearning economics video, this is not really a mathematical way to approach the LTV in particular, and it just provides this as some random axiom, or even as a hypothesis, and not neccesarily something which can be used as a scientific method, resorting to the very same argument of Kliman, debunked by Cockshot, Osuna, Diaz and company.",
