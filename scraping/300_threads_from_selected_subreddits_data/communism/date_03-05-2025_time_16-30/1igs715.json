            "body": "It's an important question but needs a few qualifications. First of all, they did. Basically every nation-state established out of a former European colony did the same thing as Egypt. In fact there wasn't even a clear relationship between the radicalism of decolonization and the extent of nationalization, as a neo-colonial collaborator government usually just led to a follow-up military coup to establish a more nationalist economic policy. Nationalization of key industries just made sense which is why you're right to be puzzled that this doesn't just always happen.\n\nSo the question is why this policy failed to generate sustainable industrial growth? Most socialists see this as basically a conspiracy, where the IMF used debt to trick third world countries into unsustainable investment and anyone who figured out what was going on was assassinated by the CIA. The IMF then forced governments to irrationally destroy themselves, the only possible rationality being the personal enrichment of a few collaborators with the US against the good of the nation. The obvious answer is to simply find the political will to resume nationalistic efforts from the past and any efforts in the regard are to be celebrated as socialism (see the military coup in Burkina Faso claiming to continue the legacy of Thomas Sankara before his assassination and the personal corruption and greed of Blaise Compaor\u00e9). This is a convenient story, with simple, actionable politics that are likely to actually happen, a coherent historical narrative, good and evil, and picking up right where global communism under Soviet leadership left off (this was basically the ideological justification for Soviet support for anti-communist third world political regimes). The only problem is that because it does actually happen, the expected results don't follow. But if your concept of Burkina Faso is a piece of land you found out about through a youtube video, it basically just disappears after its served its function in the grander narrative of \"western decline\" (which conveniently also explains why you can't afford a house or get a good job supposedly compared to your grandparents generation)\n\nI became a Marxist because I do not find explanations that reduce history and society to conspiracies and the moral qualities of individual persons convincing. But I understand that has always been the minority, usually called \"anti-revisionism.\" Unfortunately, to anyone interested in history (or unfortunate enough to actually live in Burkina Faso where politics continue after they have fallen off the front page of \"breadtube\" reddit), this story falls apart. Many communist countries, which went much further than third world nationalist regimes in nationalization policies, also went through the same cycle of debt and industrial collapse despite their political immunity to the CIA. Many political leaders in the third world were not assassinated but continued to rule and implemented the same policies. Finally the demonization of the IMF and World Bank are not entirely accurate, they usually encouraged economic diversification and some role for the state in protecting infant industry\n\nSankara may be famous for his rhetorical denunciations of IMF neocolonialism but he was not immune to the structural pressures that gave them power\n\nhttps://roape.net/2021/09/23/sankaras-elusive-socialism/\n\n>Despite [health and political] achievements, the government was still locked into a deeply unequal relationship with the world economy, and the recession that rocked the continent stung and provoked Burkina Faso\u2019s radical government. The country was dependent on gold and cotton, with cotton comprising half of all export revenue. Although cotton production increased from 60,000 tonnes a year in 1980 to 170,000 tonnes in 1987, the actual income levels, despite this increase, barely rose. The price of cotton continued the inexorable fall it had suffered since 1960 \u2013 and Sankara was powerless to affect this.\n\n>Prices of cash crops, as Sankara knew, significantly contributed to the country\u2019s overall instability (and underdevelopment). Valiant though they were, attempts to diversify the economy into production and manufactured goods were important, but remained largely symbolic. Food instability \u2013 another target of reform by the CNR \u2013 deepened in the 1980s, so in 1984 and 1985 the government was forced to import food, triggering a dramatic trade deficit. Foreign investment \u2013 the holy cow of contemporary African finance ministers \u2013 remained pitifully low under the CNR, so the deficit was filled by long-term borrowing that by 1987 had doubled the country\u2019s debt burden. Economic and financial independence remained a dream.\n\n>The regime\u2019s relationship with the World Bank was fraught. The original aim of the government was to extend Burkina Faso\u2019s potential, to make the maximum use of the country\u2019s resources. Gold mines were opened; there was an attempt to build a railway line in 1985 \u2013 undertaken by the regime itself after the World Bank and other donors refused funding \u2013 to connect manganese fields in the north-east to the rest of the country; local businesses were subsidised; and a poll tax on local farmers was lifted.\n\n>The project was not so much anti-capitalist as national capitalist development, and the World Bank was not always opposed to many of the measures: the Bank found in 1989 that economic growth in Burkina Faso between 1982 and 1987 had been \u2018satisfactory\u2019. The report noted that agriculture had performed particularly well, with an annual increase in added value of 7.1%. The reasons for this were linked to several reforms pushed through by the government, including improved land utilisation in the south and south-west, and impressive use of technology in cotton production.\n\nUltimately Sankara avoided the IMF because he did the same thing they wanted on his own\n\n>At a time when structural adjustment was being implemented across the continent as a condition for accepting IMF or World Bank loans, Burkina Faso managed to avoid external adjustment. The reason was that Sankara had been able to impose his own form of \u2018restructuring\u2019: he ensured that there was considerable control over budgetary expenditure, with a reduction in public-sector employment accompanied by attempts to generate private capital investments in manufacturing, in line with imposed \u2018reform\u2019 packages elsewhere on the continent at the time.\n\n>The genuine and committed efforts at agricultural reform included \u2018austerity\u2019 measures designed to reduce the state deficit, and as a result the income levels of state employees, teachers and civil servants suffered, and levies were raised on workers to fund development projects. Nevertheless, these efforts \u2013 attempting to make up for underdevelopment because of the country\u2019s incorporation into the global economy less than a hundred years before \u2013 were understandable; what other tools were available to achieve such development and to alleviate the region\u2019s terrible poverty and suffering?\n\n>Sankara was nothing if not an enigma. He argued for a radical plan of national self-development, condemning in powerful terms the behaviour of ex-colonial powers, financial institutions and global capitalism, yet he also in a sense made a compromise with these bodies while attempting to build up and diversify the economy. This terrible and dangerous dance \u2013 weaving between competing and hostile interests \u2013 meant that national capitalist interests overrode all others; the regime was left at the end of 1987 without any powerful domestic allies. Sankara was almost without comrades on the left. Left-wing supporters and opponents were condemned and imprisoned, and the unions were often silenced. The trade unionist Halidou Ou\u00e9draogo was unequivocal in his verdict, and it was harsh: \u201cWe do not understand how foreign socialists can have a positive verdict on Sankara, without having heard the opinion of the trade unions.\u201d\n\nTo be clear this does not mean Sankara was \"authoritarian\" or that a \"democratic\" form of socialism was preferable. Sankara's austerity is similar to the \"neoliberal developmentalism\" of AMLO\n\nhttps://newleftreview.org/sidecar/posts/amlos-austerity\n\nBecause the trade unions, state-owned corporations, and government functionaries behind them are a bloated labor aristocracy, there is no contradiction between socialism for the masses and opposing the narrow self-interest of unions and civil workers (especially in an overwhelmingly rural country). Rather the point is that the world system itself made austerity an absolute requirement. The only space for politics was the form it would take. But even a great socialist and humanist like Sankara was unable to replicate the economic nationalism of even the most mediocre of leaders during the 1970s commodity boom that followed the 1960s golden age of capitalist profitability. He was born too late, an exception to prove the rule, and in fact the control variable was Jerry Rawlings just next door, who came before Sankara, inspired him, and outlasted him. Rawlings, unlucky enough to not be martyred, instead lived long enough to be tasked with implementing IMF-backed austerity himself.",

                    "body": "So what was the cause? Simply put, the end of colonialism also meant the unification of the world market under a single US hegemony. Individual nationalisms could not compete with the new global division of labor, and building a steel industry in your country based on Soviet technology only meant you had the same steel industry as every other country doing the same thing. Not only was that industry uncompetitive after the inital growth of extensive development (the proletarianization of an idle rural population) compared to advancements in the US and Japanese steel industries, it was doubly uncompetitive as East Asia was incorporated into a global value chain of steel production. Many things made this worse which is why the crisis developed in the early 1980s rather than the late 1980s when GVCs really started to develop: the revisionist soviet union being stingy with its technology (though that technology became increasingly unattractive) and its own economic crisis (which was a matter of political choices - the unification of the socialist countries into a single economic plan would have rivaled the collective US hegemonic world system but was far from reality - this choice was not possible for the bourgeois nationalist regimes which lacked a collective system of agriculture that makes socialism possible, though not for nothing the regimes of the late 1970s attempted this and called themselves ML for this reason, but their social basis was too narrow and political ideology too murky to succeed); the legacy of colonialism which made national development out of regional, ethnic, and tribal divisions fall apart at the first sign of crisis; America's own muddled politics which were often counterproductive (the US famously stood up for Egypt against Britain and France in the Seuz but was unwilling to in Southern Africa, leading to multiple revolutions and even a revolution in Portugal which was quite scary for capitalism for a bit); the development of Chinese revisionism which arguably started in foreign policy. In places where heavy industry had failed the crisis came first, but even in places where it had succeeded like Romania and the DPRK eventually the same debt crisis manifested. Their products simpy didn't have a market once domestic demand reached its limit.\n\nDoes this mean the Chinese path was the correct one? First of all, it's hard to ask counterfactuals because the opening of China to global capitalism was itself a key piece of the collapse of national development. In fact, to really answer your question, this kind of thing happens all the time. Take for example the nationalization of the Aluminum industry in Ghana, Nkrumah's dream\n\nhttps://giadec.com/a-new-valco-beckons-govt-seeks-strategic-investor-to-galvanize-integrated-aluminium-industry-iai/\n\n>Ghana\u2019s first President, Kwame Nkrumah identified the Integrated Aluminium Industry (IAI) as the starting point to Ghana\u2019s industrialization agenda. With Ghana already having an operational bauxite mine in Awaso, Nkrumah saw the proposal by Kaiser Aluminium to establish a refinery and the VALCO smelter as timely and a major step towards the realization of an Integrated Aluminium Industry. The establishment of the Volta Aluminium Company was one of the main requirements for the realisation of the Volta River Project that established the Akosombo Hydroelectric Dam.\n\n>VALCO was built with an installed capacity of 200,000 metric tonnes of refined aluminium per year. The Aluminium smelter was run by private partners and for more than 60 years, imported alumina from oversees to feed the plant...**In 2008, the Government of Ghana, under former President John Agyekum Kufuor, acquired Kaiser\u2019s shares in VALCO making it a wholly Ghanaian owned Company**\n\nThis occurred without fanfare. Why? Nationalization happened not because of a political revolution but because the plant was uncompetitive\n\n>The plant has been operating with the same dated technology and obsolete equipment inherited from the previous owners (Kaiser Aluminium and Alcoa) and has one of the highest production costs per a ton of aluminium globally.\n\n>The lack of capital injection and modernization of the plant, over the years, has led to VALCO operating under capacity and recording loses.\n\nThat is, private capital was trying to get rid of it. This is largely because China is the world's largest producer of Aluminum at 59% of world output (2022). Any efforts to develop a national industry will run into the rock-bottom production costs in China as a direct competitor, although it is possible as labor costs increase there it is possible for some countries like Ghana to take back market share through state investment because they are so poor. China has so far deferred this because the cost of production is also tied to the linkages of multiple industries in one region, opening new frontiers to FDI, and the political stability that keeps labor relatively obedient, but the fall in the rate of profit is an absolute law, it can't be put off forever.\n\nIt's also besides the point, because China's path is indisputably capitalist (as is Ghana's). Whether it is the development of monopoly capitalism or a race to the bottom of third world capitalism is an important question but is not a matter of \"correctness\" since we are communists. As I said, there was an alternative path, and China is large enough that it could have possibly substituted for the Eastern Bloc as a whole as a self-contained socialist economic system with typical import substitution policies. One could also imagine an Asian socialist bloc once Soviet revisionism was removed from the picture had China not had its own internal capitalist counter-revolution. Capitalism was clearly not on its last legs in the 1970s but neither is it clear it could have survived without the massive injection of Chinese superexploited surplus value. Finally, the anti-communist political revolution in the USSR and Eastern Europe was somewhat exceptional. Everywhere else socialism was overthrown, whether a communist system or a nationalist-developmental one, the political system has remained largely the same. It's clear that, once the accomplishments of the USSR against fascist Germany had been rolled back, the older colonial division of the world reemerged as the fundamental limit, and China retaining a communist party in power is no different  than Vietnam or the DPRK or even Angola and Algeria, where decolonization established a permanent political regime (whereas even in those places in Europe where revisionism had been resisted such as Albania, the country that came closest to realizing Sankara's polemic against foreign debt, the 1980s still served as an excuse for the bourgeoisie to try to join US hegemony and the EU in the club of whiteness). There are exceptions in the third world where superficial political changes have taken place or where the nation itself fell apart but the CCP was equally incompetent facing protests in 1989 as the Romanian Communist Party (which was actually more comprehensive in repressing counter-revolutionary activity, the different outcomes must come from objective differences).\n\nAnyway I got sidetracked, the point is we live in a world where nationalizing resources and industry is unremarkable when it happens and when a regime comes to power that claims the mantle of socialism, they barely even bother. Just look at the difference between the rhetoric and actions of the military government in Burkina Faso. Their politics prove the point: their main target is French colonialism, which still acts in the older way of resource extraction and direct control over political sovereignty (through the CFA Franc among other things). With this has come an embrace of US investment, and there have been no real efforts at the kind of comprehensive land reform or industrial policy Sankara attempted. It's notable that the Franc exists in Africa but not in France itself, which is part of the Euro, showing how backwards the neo-colonial empire is.",

                                    "body": "The main thing missing from my post is class struggle because I was trying to deconstruct the OP's own internal logic. But the simple answer to \"why don't African nations do anything progressive?\" is because they are not dictatorships of the proletariat and therefore are incapable of waging the class struggle necessary to accomplish these tasks. But we also have to be careful here, since there is a common conclusion that socialists do capitalism better than capitalists themselves and only a proletarian revolution is capable of completing the tasks of the bourgeoisie like land reform and walking the path of state capitalism. This was an alluring argument in the 20th century but is now flipped on its head in the worst way, where nations like China and Vietnam are best situated to exploit the proletariat in the most efficient way because of the legacy of socialism. My argument above is that, with changes in the nature of imperialism, even this argument is flawed, as every national development project faced the same limit no matter how extensive its efforts at industrial development. Socialism ultimately was not able to accomplish the tasks of the bourgeoisie because those tasks are impossible in the age of imperialism, and the older pattern of the colonizing and colonized world has reemerged as if socialism never happened.\n\nI bring this up because Ethiopia is an example of the nefarious influence of Soviet revisionism. I mentioned already that many post-colonial regimes in the 1970s tried to collectivize land and called themselves Marxist-Leninist as a result. But the collective farms of Brezhnev was not the same as the collectivization of Stalin or Mao. Instead, collective farms and state farms were a technical solution to a problem of class struggle. The logic is the same as the OP: collective farming was simply more efficient and therefore through favorable investment, this superiority would cause peasants to voluntarily collectivize. What this perspective obviously misses is the class differentiation within the peasantry and the perverse incentives of the kulak class, which a land to the tiller program actually makes worse. The Soviet Union could avoid class struggle in the 1970s because it had already accomplished it in the 1930s. But those who followed revisionist advice (backed by butter and guns remember, the Soviets would overthrow anyone who didn't listen as in Afghanistan) were not so lucky. The Derg talked a big game but in fact collectivization was pitiful\n\n>Peasant farms are still the dominant economic force in the country [as of 1985/6]. These utilized, on average, about 95% of land farmed and produced over 96% of the national agricultural output. For the same period, state farms accounted for 3.2% of the total cultivated area and contributed about 2.8% of the national crop. The PCs [producer's cooperatives] accounted for roughly 1.8% of land in agricultural use and contributed about 1.2% of the total national crop production.\n\nAs mentioned, rather than utilizing class struggle to collectivize the economy, incentives were created through overinvestment\n\n>According to this plan agriculture will receive 22.1% of the total national investment. Out of the total agricultural budget, 10.8% is for peasant farming, 6.1% for state farms, 22.4% for producers' cooperatives and settlement farms, 38.6% for irrigation farming on state farms, 9.8% for export crops, 4.2% for forestry, 7.8% for livestock and 0.3% for fisheries. \n\n>The most striking point, however, is the large absolute and relative size of investment envisaged for the irrigation and settlement sub-sectors. \nThese two sub-sectors together constitute 61% of the total investment planned for agriculture and over 13% of total planned investment. Settle-ment farms are also state-owned farms. Irrigation farming is exclusively on state farms. By contrast, peasant farming is to receive only 11% of the total investment planned for agriculture corresponding to 2% of the planned total national investment. This underscores the lack of appreciation of the strategic role of smallholders in the development of Ethiopian agriculture. \n\n>Furthermore, the apportioning of this investment between the peasant and cooperative peasant farming is not clear. It is likely that despite their poor performance to date (mid term through the ten-year plan), the emphasis will continue to be on state farms, producers' cooperatives and settlement farms. This will result in underinvestment in the peasant sector, the sector which has, despite limited state support since 1975, provided the only productivity gains observed in Ethiopia's agricultural economy.\n\nBut this had the opposite effect by causing farmers to further retreat into their personal plots. As long as market prices coexist with fixed (and subsidized) state backed prices, you'll only get skimming off the top. \n\n>Farmers growing crops for sale have responded to the failure of the government to provide them with proper incentives (prices) by retreating further into the subsistence mode. Virtually all government farm-gate prices (obligatory quota selling prices) for the private sector for most crops have lagged well behind local free-market prices. Farmers terms of trade deteriorated as producer prices remained fixed relative to the prices of major agricultural inputs, particularly of fertilizer. At current official prices smallholders do not cover their cost of production for some crops.\n\nThe alternative is in Poland where the government subsidized individual peasants until they ran out of money. But you cannot support industrialization and free market prices for agriculture because the comparative advantage for underdeveloped countries is in agriculture\n\n>agriculture's share in the total value of exports was close to 90% over the period 1975-76 to 1984/85\n\nIn a country so reliant on agriculture for export, this creates a vicious cycle where agriculture is exported for industrial machinery that has no use because the price of agriculture is too high to accumulate any surplus for urban development. This is why Stalin was so insistent on maintaining grain exports during the height of collectivization, since the cure (increasing the purchasing power of the peasants) is worse than the disease (underdevelopment and recurrent agricultural famine)\n\nThis is in general something that is not intuitive about revisionism. As a thread on Hohxa's criticism of China recently pointed out, in appearance Maoist China was a regression into decentralization and collective farms (which, as Stalin pointed out, produce commodities) rather than the emphasis on state farms in the USSR, particularly under Khrushchev and the Virgin lands campaign but also Albania which completed the collectivization of land very quickly. But this is misleading, since Maoist agriculture came with class struggle and the attempt to build the objective basis for communism based on the actual level of development in the country. The USSR on the other hand was basically pushing a gimmick, where state farming allowed the proletariat to avoid class struggle against the new class of state managers and the system of decentralized autonomy and profit motive beyond the quota that was the actual motivating incentive for the system. Still, is worth pointing out that even though the Virgin lands campaign was mostly a failure, the USSR never had famine again and the restoration of capitalism did not come from the peasantry. Revieionism was not able to reverse the gains of collectivization as in China, where the nature of ideological difference is much clearer (and I think makes soviet revisionism retroactively more clear).\n\nBtw all of this is from \"Development of agriculture in Ethiopia since the 1975 land reform.\" The paper is from 1991 but the data only goes up to 1985. And to be fair to the Derg, they did try even after Gorbachev came to power and abandoned even Brezhnev's form of revisionism. The Villagization campaign is the most well known attempt at a more comprehensive collectivization, and the general pattern of the 1970s ML post-colonial regimes was they were significantly to the left of the USSR (which everyone understood was useless). But these states were not proletarian revolutions and did not have a mass base forged in people's war. They simply lacked the social basis to accomplish this even if they had a clear vision of the mass line in the countryside, which they did not. As the numbers show, despite anti-communist hysteria, such efforts were in actual practice very limited and Villagization came far too late. Understanding that would require another post getting into the differences between the North and South of Ethiopia, the failure to construct a non-chauvanistic, national identity and the superficial radicalism of some forms of collective labor (as in Cambodia) which in actual incentive structure are forms of production for the market. Collectivization must come with industrialization and mechanization of agriculture, otherwise you're just doing the work of neocolonialism for it. I'll admit though that I need to do more research on the Villagization program.\n\nE: from what I can tell Villagization was comparable to collectivization in South Vietnam after unification. It was done very quickly in a militaristic manner and then quickly abandoned. It's not clear that it can be compared to collectivization in the USSR or China which did not involve large movements of people into new settlements but instead inserted class struggle into already existing villages. It is notable though that it happened in multiple countries in Africa, some of which were not not even ostensibly socialist. And the justification in Ethiopia, at least initially, was a form of the virgin lands campaign, where famine could be avoided through the relocation of people. I'll stop for now and return later.",

I never expected it to be wrong.\n\nMaybe I phrased it wrong, what I mean is that the conquests of socialism do not stick unless they progress towards communism. The French revolution was defeated but its conquests were maintained, France never regressed into feudalism. For the same reason, because socialism must now fulfill the tasks of the bourgeoisie, there is an implication that overthrowing socialism is impossible because the bourgeoisie is already getting what it wants out of socialism. This is why the dissolution of the USSR is seen as a kind of conspiracy. Even if Yeltsin was a capitalist, why wouldn't he want to maintain the much larger territory, population, and economic power of the USSR? Now that Putin seems to want to restore the USSR but chauvinistically dominated by Russia, Yeltsin is seen as either an idiot who sabotaged his own self interest or someone who was so focused on overthrowing socialism that he had to sacrifice the USSR which Putin is now correcting. As you can imagine, I find these kind of explanations unsatisfying, Yelsin was a drunk idiot but then the question (which you asked me before in relation to Yezhnov) was how this idiot gained supreme power? It's also worth pointing out how unsuccessful Putin has actually been compared to the accomplishments of Soviet socialism, so this explanation is increasingly delusional about the inevitable success of the great Russian civilization, as if nations hadn't come into existence (ironically negating the entire point about bourgeois revolutions).\n\nTo your question, what has changed is the terms have been reversed. Rather than socialism accomplishing the tasks of the bourgeoisie on the way to communism, it is rather the task of socialists to regress to capitalism until it has fulfilled its historical task over centuries. But even in a great historical civilization like China, the nation is coming apart at the seams, with the late additions to the Qing empire becoming harder and harder to control. More directly relevant, nation building was a failure in nearly all of Africa, and repeating the past as the OP asks is no more likely to be successful the next time around. There was an idea that at least the nation would be an irreversible accomplishment of decolonization and it was only up to those particularly backwards holdovers (like the Zionist occupation of Palestine) for this bourgeois task to be accomplished. That didn't happen and there must be an alternative path than trying again to unify North and South Nigeria under an \"African socialist\" regime. \n\n>And I appreciate the citation. It\u2019s helpful but if you have anything else that once made you \u201clike the Derg\u201d or now have these critiques would be interesting too.\n\nI can't remember the context but I would imagine I said that because there is no one else left to defend them. The third world ML regimes of the 1970s are interesting because history is interesting but you're not going to find the key to revolution in South Yemen, they're all sort of interchangeable and don't have \"universal\" features to speak in abstract terms. The biggest problem is, like I said above, that Ethiopians don't actually exist outside of Ethiopia. By that I mean Dengists have been forced to take a position on the China-Vietnam war because it is unavoidable. That Vietnamese Dengists (Luna Oi) and Chinese Dengists (Qiao collective) have completely opposite views which cannot coexist is simply ignored. If Dengists were forced to take a position on the Ethiopia-Eritrea-Somalia war the same thing would happen, and the incompatible views of people from those actual countries would be ignored. I find all manner of artifice, hypocrisy, and theoretical pragmatism repulsive, so I am forced to take the Derg's ideology seriously on its own terms even if I have to do it on my own. I feel a sense of obligation to the people of Ethiopia precisely because the smug anti-imperialism of Dengists does not allow them to actually speak, an even more nefarious form of racism than simple white supremacy. But Ethiopians will be forced to understand their own history to make a revolution, they can't just dismiss it as some minor episode of 20th century \"imperfection.\"\n\nI've pointed out that Vijay Prashad is unlucky enough to actually be Indian, so to his audience of white Americans he can go on about BRICS and multipolarity but at home he is forced to be much more critical. But the reverse is not true, his audience does not gain insight into India through Prashad, instead they are willfully blind to the hypocrisy of his work. People like Ben Norton are much more useful anyway, Prashad is obnoxious but he's no fool, he did perfectly reasonable but harmless academic work before finding this pot of gold and adulation (though his work is not good to be clear, but there's a lot of garbage in academia). The future is strangers in a strange land repeating talking points to a camera (or rather morons in a strange land). Sorry I can't help getting distracted, it's really annoying me lately.",

Against the concept that land parcelization is superior because it gives individual producers maximum incentive on the market, Marxists would say \"yeah obviously that's not true.\" But the empirical claim, that land reform didn't really make any productivity difference in Taiwan, is more interesting and intuitively correct. Land reform is the basis for capitalist development but in itself it does very little, hence South Korea was completely dysfunctional until the mid-1960s. More generally, as is the point of this thread, land-to-the-tiller reforms were nearly universal in the third world and ultimately made no difference to the collapse of bourgeois nationalism. That does not mean they are useless. Rather, as I've been pointing out, they are necessary as the first step towards collectivization on the initiative of the masses. Their record on generating capitalist accumulation is sketchy though, the African nations we're discussing failed both as socialist and capitalist experiments and the old semi-feudal pattern has reemerged, with the state acting as the agent of international monopoly agribusiness.\n\n>Sorry for bringing this up but it seem you're certain that land reform was central to the \"East Asian developmental model\". I don't know if Thailand is actually part of it given its partial land reform.\n\nMost of the third world was rightly concerned with semi-feudalism as the objective blockage to accomplishing the basic tasks of bourgeois nationalism. That hasn't changed but few consider the limits of overcoming semi-feudalism because it was taken for granted that collectivization would come next. Now that China has reversed that process and comparable land reform in East Asia is in a state of permanent stagnation, I'm questioning how useful bourgeois nationalism even is in the 21st century. Socialism is necessary to go through the historical tasks of the bourgeoisie. But is the reverse true? Can capitalists fulfill their own tasks through socialism?",

I think they are for political reason against the widely hatred KMT regime but even as the author pointed out there are more data about Taiwanese agriculture in the US or Japan than Taiwan itself.

I elaborated on the historical explanation but, until the military government is overthrown, there are usually 4 explanations given for the present.\n\nFirst, that they are playing the \"long game\" and tricking the west into not coup-ing them. That there is no evidence of this is proof that it's true, since if you know then the CIA must know. That you don't know but the CIA does is unthinkable, despite the many intelligent, qualified people who work there for a lot of money. They just aren't listening to the right podcasts. Also why they keep bragging about overthrowing colonialism is unclear, they are throwing off the plan. I would dismiss this as laughable except it is widespread and there are even books written with significant effort (though no one has ever denied that conspiratorial thinking leads to great exertions of effort in trying to share one's ideas) with this exact title. \n\nSecond, that no one is \"perfect\" but we must critically support what is possible. This is more of a religious concept than an explanation, since the features of imperfection are never elaborated. Why is Burkina Faso imperfect in this way and not in others? All that matters is that the world bends towards perfection on its own if you believe hard enough (and do your part on Reddit and twitter to spread the gospel).\n\nThird, that the market itself is both necessary and ideal so what exists is all that is possible. This is also a form of religious thinking but instead of a moral concept, it is a neoliberal faith in the market applied retroactively to the most crude form of the theory of the \"productive forces.\" It still doesn't really explain anything though, since reality can only be understood retroactively. If everything that happens is necessary, why did it take Burkina Faso so long to restore a \"socialist\" government? Why did Tainanmen square happen in the first place? Behind crude determinism is the most blatant subjectivism. \"If only this government listened to me. Then they wouldn't have wasted decades believing in the American delusion.\" Obviously this also combines delusional arrogance with smug determinism, that you cannot possibly know better than billions of people constructing socialism in their way unless they do something I don't like in which case they need to read my blog. In a sense, I know Burkina Faso better than it knows itself, since for some mysterious reason its leaders still have not gotten the memo about the irreversible decline of the west (the similarity with Spengler is more a matter of common logic than direct influence, books in general have no business here).\n\nFinally, there are the fascist ideas about essential culture, geopolitics, great and lesser nations, and the singularity of great leaders. This also would not be worth mentioning except it is widespread on the \"socialist\" left and provides probably the only attempt at a scientific explanation that provides cause and effect and predictive power. Presumably Burkina Faso is simply lacking compared to China in Confucian values of social harmony or a truly great leader like Putin, even though they also haven't done much in the way of nationalizing. Few articulate this openly, it is rather a de-facto result of Burkina Faso vanishing from discussion until it again serves the great projects of BRICS, that is it ceases to be part of History.\n\nAny theory of the class interests and limits of the national bourgeoisie as a class are long gone, I doubt anyone even knows the term. Bizarrely, world systems theory is also gone despite preparing the ground for many of these vulgar ideas, probably because its unnecessary to couple far right ideas about Chinese and Russia culture with a critical foundation about the nature of capital accumulation on a world scale. I liked this post so I decided to give a serious answer, especially because that little known nationalization of the Aluminum industry in Ghana is so fascinating, but already the Dengists are coming in. I write these posts mostly for myself, expecting anything from reddit other than to absorb them and turn them to mush is just asking to be disappointed. Though I don't even really blame Dengists (except for the ones who make it a career), these are all the possibilities for politics when class does not exist in one's horizon and one acts as an atomized individual within the ideological values of neoliberalism. You can't really expect petty-bourgeois youth to come to a scientific understanding of the world when scientific practice is so remote from their actual lives. Still, I don't really expect anything from the OP, though looking at your post history I'm glad you got a brief refuge from the revisionists that have taken over every other subreddit, even late stage capitalism (which I was once a mod of before \"tankies\" were purged, so it's remarkable now that they have a bot that bans any criticism of Chinese capitalism).",

Was Tanzania under Nyerere \"semi-colonial?\" Probably when it relied on British support to survive a mutiny\n\nhttps://oxfordre.com/africanhistory/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-807?p=emailAgzSbKuxwZ6nA&d=/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-807\n\nWas it still a semi-colony when it nationalized most of the economy? \n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/subject/africa/nyerere/1967/arusha-declaration.htm\n\nHow about when it went to the IMF for a bailout?\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/08/09/tanzania-imf-reach-accord-on-200-million-loan/c872e265-400e-4568-8a31-92c847094860/\n\nRemember, this was all under the same system led by the same man. Do you understand how insufficient your concept is? Even Nyerere was not so delusional \n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/24/world/nyerere-and-tanzania-no-regrets-at-socialism.html\n\n>Mr. Nyerere said socialism did allow the Tanzanian economy to develop in the 1960's and 70's. \"There was growth and wealth distribution,\" he said, and statistics generally support this view.\n\n>What knocked Tanzania off course, he said, was \"the hostile international environment\" of the 1970's and 80's, including rising oil prices that \"absorbed 60 percent of foreign exchange earnings\" and falling revenues from the sale of sisal hemp and coffee, major Tanzanian exports.\n\n>Sisal, once the raw material of ropes and mats, was increasingly replaced by synthetics, and the international commodity price of coffee plummeted.\n\n>\"We used to sell our coffee in London for $:3,000 a ton, now we get $:600,\" he said. \"How do you fight that?\"\n\nWhat Nyerere can't do is use Marxism to explain these movements in price and why they doomed an epoch of \"African socialism.\" Nyerere was a smart man and maintained his belief in socialism to the end so this is an ideological blockage.
