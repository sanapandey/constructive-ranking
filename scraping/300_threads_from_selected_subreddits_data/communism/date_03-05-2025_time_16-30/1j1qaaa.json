You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-Marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to Marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or Marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/communism) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

            "body": "I\u2019m not familiar with this publication and they spammed this article into multiple subreddits. However, important points about the growth of conservative populism were made. I wanted to give a breakdown of those points.\n\nA striking outcome of these elections is the AfD obtaining a majority of votes in all states of the former GDR and an example of responses.\n\n>The development of right-wing extremism in the East is presented in a vulgarly idealistic way by bourgeois political scientists as above as a personal problem of the East\u2026Without asking: what has this democracy brought to the people in the East?\u2026Even supposedly left-wing media repeatedly publish articles that highlight the \u201c_lower level of education_\u201d of the AfD electorate, as if level of education were some kind of political exclusion criterion.\u00a0  \n\nThe article goes on to analyze why the East has moved in this direction. This pairs well with a statement from Dimitrov about the rise of fascism: _\u201dfascism usually comes to power in the course of a mutual, and at times severe, struggle against the old bourgeois parties, or a definite section of these parties.\u201d_\n\n>For the people in the East, the \u201cold parties\u201d stand for the Treuhand, which cost two thirds of all GDR citizens their jobs after the fall of the Wall; they stand for 34 years of incomplete straightening of the East-West disparity\u2026The people of East Germany were so screwed over by their new rulers through the privatization of over 50% of all companies, the elimination of 3 million of the 4 million jobs and the closure of a third of all companies in the same year of the fall of the Berlin Wall that more than a third of the adult population felt that they\u00a0_were \u201cno longer needed in this society_\u00a0\u201c (Zeit).\u00a0  \n \nThe economic problems in the east continue today.\n\n>\u202639 percent of those permanently low-income in Germany live in the new federal states\u2026\n\nAnd of course bourgeois nationalism pushed by pro-capitalist politicians and the other sections of the ruling class\u2019 superstructure create the below attitudes.\n\n>This feeling of injustice, which is based on the material conditions in East Germany, also gave rise to the resentment against migrants on the part of many people in the East; to put it polemically, they do not want to understand why \u201c_they_\u201d are helped but \u201c_we_\u201d are not\u2026This nostalgic distortion of reality, combined with anti-communism since 1990, then gives rise to such contradictory figures as neo-Nazis with GDR flags.\n\nConfusion is also visible with:\n\n>A study by the University of Leipzig shows that two thirds of the 3,500 East Germans surveyed say that they long for the GDR again.\n\nThe article continues with additional comment on nationalism. Though nationalism is a part of typical bourgeois society, I believe their point was to show its growth in times of economic crisis. \n\n>Nationalism as a reaction to the crisis is a common feature of fascist development: the tendency of the lower middle class and the middle class to turn to the NSDAP was a consequence of the deep economic crisis of the 1920s and 30s.\u00a0Gramsci wrote: \u201c_The lower middle class and the impoverished sections of the middle class panic in times of crisis and instinctively turn to the strongest force that promises them security and order._\u201d\u00a0  \n\n>Thus, the feeling of \u201c_humiliation_\u201d after the Treaty of Versailles draws some parallels to the feeling of East Germans of having been pushed into a precarious and subordinate position by the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nThe author jumps straight over any talk of a united front to stop the growth of fascism but does reiterate that capitalism creates the seeds of fascism.\n\n>As long as the material contradictions in this country are not resolved, ie as long as capitalism exists, it will not be possible to stop the fascist development.\u00a0",
