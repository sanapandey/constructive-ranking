    "selftext": "Hello comrades, as any of you knows, we are living in a time in which the imperium is crumbling and capitalism is on the brink of imploding. For many, the fight for a liberated Palestine has ignited a spark and once again made clear that the people are the ones that hold the power. But this is also what confuses me at the moment.   \nI am a university student who has been active in organising for the pro-Palestine movement last year but still feel like many of us are as confused as I am about our role in the movement and relation to non-students/-scientists. \n\nAs a Marxist, it is clear to me that students are thoroughly part of the proletariat, even when not engaging in physical labour and having priviliges that many of us do not possess. This fact leads some of us to conclude that students should **not** enagage in a special function/role within the proletariat and should only take up the same means as other proletarians who engage in manual labour. I think this is a flawed conception.   \nI understand that the university is a colonial entitty and have personally experienced many push backs in pursuing radical studies. Can't students use their knowledge to enrich the understanding of the current events and dilemmas autnomous from the universities, and thus, truly serve the masses?\n\nDoes any of you have experience in conducting research that is thoroughly in service of popular struggle and revolution, guided by Marxist principles? Perhaps combining multiple disciplines and non-traditional methods, and what has your experience been like to engage with mental labour in a time and place where manual work is emphasised (also rightly so for the most part) and science is by many seen as being alienated from the masses?\n\nIt would also help me tremendously if some of you could recommend some good literature on the subject. I am looking specifically for science's role in student organsing/revolution or struggle and not specifically for decolonising the university. I have read quite a lot of literature on this last subject already and have found that many scientists are still stuck with serving a colonial institution in stead of conducting research that serves the measses and popular struggle.",

From My understanding, depending on the material conditions, they are Primarily Petite Bourgeois. Which doesn't mean that we should ignore them, but that we must be principled in our interactions with them and not try and focus ourselves on the petite Bourgeoisie but focus on organizing the Proletariat. The party itself must not become Petite Bourgeois and must always focus on the Proletariat.\n\n\nAlso, you're saying that there are Proletarians who do intellectual/mental Labor when, at least in the US I have no idea of the conditions outside the US, the Petite Bourgeoisie primarily works by mental Labor, a few examples are Teachers/professors, doctors, intellectuals, lawyers, small business owners, middle and lower management, etc.\n\n\nIf you want some writings on science and it's class basis then I can recommend Dialectical Materialism and Science by Maurice Cornforth\u00a0\nhttps://redstarpublishers.org/Cornforth.pdf\n\n\nBourgeois science in it's imperialist era is primarily Mechanical Materialist and Idealist.\n\n\nEdit: I realize your asking for assistance with understanding class struggle in the Sciences and this is a question that I am still trying to study. How do we act Principally and engage in class struggle, apply Two Line Struggle in Science? I'm curious about the answers other Comrades have.",

While much of the current science -as you write, in the imperialist era- serves the bourgeoisie (and further strenghtening your claim that scientists are petite bourgeois) since the university is an imperialist and colonial entity, we should strive to make science serve the proletariat and revolutionary struggle. \nIt is therefore a question about interrogating and altering class relations. But how do we do that without inadvertently strenghtening the position of the bourgeoisie and becoming elitist? Does this mean a severance of ties with university or can we still use it as an entity to our benefit until we have built something better, or will 'proletarian science perhaps only be possible when a socialist state has been established?\n\n\nI have not come across a lot of writing on this topic (let alone answers to these questions) except for 'decolonial' literature. Not to understate the importance of decolonising colonial institutions but I have not come across many authors who have outlined a situation guided by Marxist ideas.",

Are you referring to people here in india or the third world in particular or just as is? Because students in india are a revolutionary group even if they belong to the petty-bourgeois class. This should be abundantly clear to anyone familiar with the historical role of student orgs in our country right from Naxalbari (even Presidency students - one of the most elite universities of that era and perhaps now also - had formed armed squads). We will get back to this. \n\nFurther, how are we classifying prestigious versus non-prestigious universities? Is JNU prestigious? Is IIT prestigious? But the class character of the students in both would be different given the fee difference in both. There is also the admission process, however, which culls the non-performing (read: those who did not have the comfort to prepare for entrance exams which are based on complete rote-memorization). I am making this distinction because indian academia is in a phase of transition and the previously elite state owned universities are now becoming not so elite and while the former allowed the entry of working class students, the latter despises them thoroughly. \n\nThere is little doubt that indian academia/university system is becoming more and more restrictive to the working class. For instance, this year when i was admitted to DU, the fee for phd had been increased to 17k from 4k per annum. Keep in mind that 9k a month is boundary line between 90% of the population and the 10%. \n\nThe NEP is set to privatise whatever little was left of the state-owned universities. There are no more recruitment drives for teaching positions. Scholarships for minorities have been done away with. This is all assuming that the person has had access to schooling in the first place. \n\nInterestingly, however, according to a government report, 60.56% colleges are in rural areas. And 78.6% are private. This does posit the possibility that most university students have a petty-bourgoise background. But data is difficult to find and as such is unreliable. \n\nhttps://www.education.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/statistics-new/aishe_eng.pdf\n\nHaving provided some context and coming back to the question of whether students are a revolutionary group, the cpi maoist has this to say on the issue:\n\n> Students-Youth \u2013 The students are a revolutionary force. They are facing severe injustice due to the unscientific and undemocratic education system. Their future is bleak. We must organise them and build struggles for free education to all, scientific education, against the saffronisation and privatization of education, culture and history, against the cut in the budget for education and against hike in fees, for the withdrawal of higher educational institutions of foreign MNCs and for the annulment of the post-modernist syllabus and researches prepared by the imperialist/comprador ruling classes and against the New Education Policy that the Modi government brought forth transforming all these into a policy.\n\n- Changes in Relations of Production\n\nMind you, this is under the subheading of petty-bourgois class.\n\nu/Sea_Till9977",

Rather, I don't think they are 'objectively' revolutionary as the working class is but after reading your comment I'm not comfortable defending that point, since I very well may be using the word 'objectively' wrong. Regardless, my point is that students do not become automatically revolutionary because I don't believe that their revolutionary potential is immanent. Of course this inevitably takes us into the question of \"what is the class composition of students\".\n\nOf course I am aware of the role of students in Naxalbari. Even recently universities erupted in their protests against the CAA-NRC. But is a revolutionary consciousness in the interests of students regardless of which class they come from? That is what I'm not sure about. You have progressive democratic student groups, you also have revisionist ones and then outright fascist groups like ABVP. Like you acknowledged as well, universities are becoming increasingly restrictive and only accessible to the upper classes. Of course, this does not mean they cannot be revolutionary due to their petty bourgeois status. However, the reality is university is becoming increasingly less affordable.\n\nLike I said before though, I am clearly out of my depth on this topic. The main reason I wrote my comment was because OP's sentiment that you only have to be a small capitalist to be petty bourgeois is something that is used by petty bourgeois leftists commonly to avoid any sort of self-criticism of their class. Narrow definitions of petty bourgeoisie from [Marxism.org](http://Marxism.org) do not suffice and it's usually a crutch for a lack of any concrete analysis. OP also equates elite universities with those universities that are around the capital city of a third world nation, but this isn't true especially in semi-feudal nations like India where rural universities also can be restrictive considering the inequality between landless peasants and landed classes (and castes). It's almost a common meme for petty bourgeois youth in India to say \"Im not rich im upper middle class/middle class\" for a reason.\n\nEdit: In sum, I guess intentionally or not my issue is not whether students in the third world (esp India in my case) are revolutionary or not, but whether we consider them petty bourgeois or not. I read CPI(Maoist) critique of Kobad Gandhy's book \"Fractured Freedom\" and they talk about how intellectuals that enter the revolutionary movement do so as an intellectual, for intellectual reasons. Not because they have personal experience (aka the exploitation). I guess this is what I had in mind when writing.\n\nEither way feel free to critique this whole comment.",

While this class is most abundant in the least industrialized regions of the world, only dwindling remnants remain in more industrialized areas.\u00a0\n\n>These people are the foundation of the capitalist dream (aka \u201cthe American dream\u201d): to start a small business and expand it into an empire. Much of capitalist growth and development comes from these people, while at the same time capitalism stamps out these people more and more with bigger and better industries that no small proprieter can compete against. Thus for the past few decades in the U.S., petty-bourgeois are given an enourmous variety of incentives, tax breaks, grants, loans, and ways to escape unscathed from a failed business.\n\n>2) Also refers to the growing group of workers whose function is management of the bourgeois apparatus. These workers do not produce commodities, but instead manage the production, distribution, and/or exchange of commodities and/or services owned by their bourgeois employers.\u00a0\n\n>While these workers are a part of the\u00a0[working class](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/r.htm#proletariat)\u00a0because they receive a wage and their livelihood is dependent on that wage, they are seperated from working class consciousness because they have day-to-day control,\u00a0*but not ownership*, over the means of production, distribution, and exchange.\n\n  \n[https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/e.htm](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/e.htm)\n\n  \nI fail to see how that could include university students in general. Even if you expand the definition to include those children of the petite bourgeois that would not account for the majority of the students in the 3rd world--which was my point. That this label of university students as petite bourgeois is 1st world centric. I don't deny they exist in the 3rd world, but they are the minority at the few prestigious universities usually around capital regions. Joma, for example, [would label students petty bourgeoisie](https://aklatangbayan.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/stuggle_for_national_democracy_third_ed_-_book.pdf) but he operated exclusively out of these relatively rich universities around the capital. Many of these students end up going to the 1st world for education because they adhere to liberal ideology, but these are a minority of student population overall. The majority of students outside of these regions have revolutionary potential given their material conditions.\n\n>... but they are not considered an objectively revolutionary group is what the essence of the point is (if im not characterising it incorrectly).\n\nWhile I agree with this (but would use the term inherently instead, objectively many have the potential to be given their material conditions), that does not make them petite bourgeois. I am not sure if I have seen a proper analysis of the situation of 3rd world university students, but if you have please let me know. Or, if there is a more comprehensive analysis of petite bourgeois in the present day that would also be of interest.\n\n>  \nThe major universities with more prestige are obviously very petty-bourgeoisie (universities in which there are working class students either because of affirmative actions or for other reasons), but then you have lower level universities in less developed areas. I cannot comment on the concrete aspects of this topic.\n\n  \nThese universities from less developed areas contain the body of students that I work with directly, hence my frustration when labels such as petite bourgeois are thrown about in an uncritical fashion, typically by the very people who are themselves petite bourgeois (from the 3rd world or not).",

This is what my question is mainly about. Research seems to currently serve more often than not the purpose of the capitalists, since the university is a capitalist institution. Since academics can be proletarian, the question is how science can **serve** the proletariat in stead of the capitalist class.",

Lewontin's \"Ideology in biology\" lecture does point out ideology in science in a similar manner to Lysenko though.",
