And I\u2019ve been to Australia, where I became very aware that I was staying on stolen land, with no say on the part of the native inhabitants, and for the first time in my life, not by the incendent of me being born there, but by my own volition. \n\nThat was six years ago, and although I haven\u2019t had the opporitinity to travel since then, I\u2019ve been uneasy about the idea of it. Is it appropriate for me, a resident of the imperial core, to visit countries that my own has imposed hardships upon? If presented with the opportunity to travel to somewhere like Iraq or Vietnam, should I decline out of respect, or in practice would I just be shielding myself from the harsh realities of crimes I\u2019ve been complicit in as a US citizen, and denying myself a useful perspective when it comes to fighting for meaningful change on the global scale?

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I will never go back despite aching to. It has affected me deeply how tourism is used to destroy and then make reliant indigenous communities. Until we can destroy capitalism, traveling as a tourist in another country is something I will avoid.",

Not really consequential either way because you're just *one person*. Go if you want to or don't.\n\n>If presented with the opportunity to travel to somewhere like Iraq or Vietnam, should I decline out of respect, or in practice would I just be shielding myself from the harsh realities of crimes I\u2019ve been complicit in as a US citizen, and denying myself a useful perspective when it comes to fighting for meaningful change on the global scale?\n\n*Crimes you've been complicit in?* What do you mean? Like when people in this subreddit talk about how American workers (white labor aristocrats) benefit from the spoils of imperialism then that's just a matter of fact and not chastisement, it's not like you personally worked with your uncle in a lab to create Agent Orange. Get over yourself.\n\nWe would use that fact to chastise figures who say stuff like \"American workers and Colombian workers should rise up against the coffee bosses in international solidarity\" or \"Palestinian and Israeli workers need to reject both Zionism and Hamasism to find the third path, the communist path.\"",

I boycott settler states when travelling too so I don\u2019t contribute to the suffering and persecution of indigenous people. And travelling to occupied Palestine is a big no no. Also the way often white tourists from the imperial core treat tourists in the global south is often from a colonialist entitlement.",
