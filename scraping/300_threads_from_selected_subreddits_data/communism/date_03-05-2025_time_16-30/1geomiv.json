It seems to be implied that engineers are part of this group. Does anyone have any resources discussing the class position of engineers, the relationship of engineers to the labor movement, and/or how the engineering profession was transformed in historical socialist nations? The view that makes the most sense to me as far as class position goes is that most engineers are part of the proletariat, but their predecessors in the early industrial revolution were part of the petty bourgeoisie who contracted out their services and gradually became proletarianized as time went on. Because of the origins of the profession, their salaries, and other factors, engineers still largely have a petty-bourgeois mentality (which is evident to me as a practicing engineer - haha). Interested to see what you all think about this question!",

But as you've seen yourself, this doesn't align with reality since your peers still largely have a petty-bourgeois outlook. This isn't an accident - engineers, doctors, and lawyers own capital. Despite the fact that they are paid a salary and have a boss, they own their own homes which accrue ground rent, real estate, stocks, index funds, etc. Most professionals aim to accumulate enough capital so they can become full-time money capitalists and live comfortably off dividends in their retirement. \n\nWe know this is true. But the mechanism of how this happens is more confusing for me. I've seen other threads where people have said professionals are owners of capital in the form of their skills. Which on it's face makes some sense. All skills have a certain value - a given average number of labour-time. But what allows some skills to function as capital and others sold just for it's value? As you see in this thread, professionals defend themselves as nothing more than skilled proletarians. What's missing is how each \"worker\" fits into the production process as a whole.\n\n>how the engineering profession was transformed in historical socialist nations? \n\nThe barefoot doctors provided an example for all professionals. Under capitalism, professionals serve the bourgeoisie, and science is crippled and stunted for this purpose. Under socialism, professionals will integrate with the masses, proletarianize themselves, which does mean engaging in productive activity. Their knowledge, which was once their private means of enrichment, will be made the property of all people and everyone will have the opportunity to develop their skills in engineering, medicine, etc. The back of this capitalist division of labour between mental and manual labour will be broken as now people will be farmer-doctor, computer engineer-factory worker.",

I've just finished _Wage Labour and Capital_ and this seems odd to me since in that book Marx's characterizes capital thusly:\n\n> Capital does not consist in the fact that accumulated labour serves living labour as a means for new production. It consists in the fact that living labour serves accumulated labour as the means of preserving and multiplying its exchange value.\n\nThis made sense to me since my original idea of capital as \"anything that has the ability to create more value\" seemed to be so broad as to strip the word of all meaning^([1]). But how would _skills_ fit into this? How does living labour serve to preserve and multiply the exchange value of an engineer's skills? Or is _capital_ being used in a different sense here?\n\n----\n----\n\n[1] As I see it, this logic would imply that a sickle in the hands of a peasant would be capital since it technically \"creates more value\" through the harvest the peasant reaps and thus capital would have basically existed as long as class society has. I'm not sure if there's something wrong with my logic here though.",

For my purposes I can imagine any skill as a big pile of money. The difference between one pile of money that you use to just get the minimum necessities of life or one that you use as capital is - with capital, you buy labour-power which has the quality of reproducing its own value as well as producing surplus-value. So, if with my skill I can hire labourers who produce surplus value, or I'm hired by an employer who gives me a cut of the surplus-value produced by others, then my skill can function as capital, right?\n\nSomeone else who understands political economy better than I do should probably correct or lend some clarity to what you've said.",

If I'm accurately representing WLC, it does so because the necessary labour requisite to the production of the wage-labourer in whatever position requires that skill includes the labour involved in the acquisition of that skill. But the process of actually generating surplus value from wage-labourers, even if you needed a skill to get to a position where you could even do this, does not involve the skill anymore - it only involves the extraction of surplus value from the wage-labourers. Actually I'm not even sure anymore, I'll probably need to run through examples in my head later to see if I can prove that wrong.",

I think I was mistaken about a skill functioning as capital in that way because the skill would be a part of the outlay on constant capital not variable capital (the money given as wages). So it would just be paid for at it's value.\n\nHere's the example in my head: An MBA graduate gets a bank loan and sets up a factory. He has a capital outlay on constant capital (building, materials, his own level of education to develop skilled managerial labour) and variable capital (labour-power). He might make surplus-value but his skill is just an extra cost that he pays for... And how does the situation change when instead of operating his own independent enterprise, he is hired as a manager of a much larger business, and yet still he recieves enough in salary to be a capitalist in his own right. In that comment by u/Labor-Aristocrat they just assert blankly what we are trying to explain:\n\n>An imperial core engineer receives significantly more value than the value of their labour power,\n\nWhy? What about their position allows them to do that. And leaving \"imperial core\" out of it, what about an engineer in a third-world country?",

And leaving \"imperial core\" out of it, what about an engineer in a third-world country?\n\nFirst of all, I think it's necessary to distinguish having a higher wage due to the specific position of a country in the imperialist world system and having a higher wage than the majority of wage workers due to having a skill. However, both things are related - the division of labour is international and, according to Sam King, the highest labour processes are concentrated in first world countries, in the form of monopoly, while third world countries have the lower end processes dispersed in non-monopoly capital. This affects the distribution of skilled labour worldwide. Of course, engineers still exist in third world countries, but since the commodities produced are different, the role they occupy in the production process is also different from the first world engineers. But the difference in pay in that case is not really a matter of skill, but of the type of capital involved, its capacity to pay higher wages (depending on their capacity to retain surplus-value) and the value of labour-power in each country.\n\nMarx says:\n> What, then, is the cost of production of labour-power? It is the cost required for the maintenance of the labourer as a labourer, and for his education and training as a labourer.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/wage-labour/ch04.htm\n\nIn Marx's time it was the labourer who had to finance their skill, so wages had to necessarily account for that cost. That part of value would then circulate to those who sell the skill, supporting their livelihood. But transmitting the skill is not productive labour. The skill itself has no value. In addition, nowadays the state mediates the whole process. So I don't think the value of labour-power has to necessarily account for the cost of acquiring the skill. What is necessary is that some value produced reaches those who reproduce skilled labour, who perform necessary, but unproductive labour. This value can reach them directly, from the money given to them by the labourer, or indirectly, from the state or from collaboration with companies. If the cost of reproduction of these unproductive workers are not necessarily tied to the wage of the skilled worker, the value of labour-power becomes the subsistence minimum. Everything else is sharing of surplus-value.\n\nWhat, then, explains their wages being considerably higher than the minimum wage? What having a skill does is, first of all, being able to work in a specific (depending on the skill acquired) and necessary position in the production process (or in circulation or in finance, but in that case the work is unproductive - not that it changes anything). Skilled labour power differs from non-skilled labour power in that the market for the former is much smaller due to the skill requirement. The number of people having a specific skill is constrained by its own reproduction process. The number of skilled labourers reproduced is dictated by the requirements of capital (necessary skilled positions), as well as the financial capacity of wage earners to acquire that skill and the concrete role of the state in distributing surplus-value. The wage of a specific position has to be sufficiently high to attract a skilled worker, otherwise they would not prefer skilled over non-skilled positions, or over other skilled positions also available to them. But it is only determined by supply (number of skilled workers of a specific skill) and demand (available positions, dictated by the production process), since it is only a redistribution of surplus-value between opposed claims. Its lower limit is the minimum wage plus the amount that skilled workers need in order to directly support their own education and that of their family (depending on the concrete role of the state in the reproduction of skilled labour).\n\nHope I was clear enough and keep in mind this is only some reflections mostly from reading Capital and stuff on Imperialism, I may be wrong.",

After all, without being part of the entire process of extracting surplus value, they would cease to be capital. I think this is a part of what Marx was referring to in the \"What is a Negro\" segment - it's not just the physical machinery that can be considered capital, and the relation of production is also a significant part of that. I'm pretty sure we're in agreement here, though.\n\nThe machinery is only made (a part of) capital through the process of this surplus value extraction which basically allows capital to sustain its inner functions, which includes whatever the machine does. Whether this maintenance involves removing a machine, replacing a machine, adding upgrades to the machine, or just fixing the wear and tear, all that matters is that something that does what the machine does still exists. In fact, that last part isn't even true - it is not necessary that something that does what the machine does still exists, and it seems feasible that a machine's \"function\" can be completely disposed of insofar as the system of surplus value extraction keeps going. Capital isn't literally a single machine but the entire system that generates surplus value, or else you would start getting into Ship of Theseus arguments very quickly.\n\nWell, that's where my mind is at, at least. I think I'm unsatisfied with my own explanation because talking to you and /u/MajesticTree954 made me realize that I had encountered the terms \"variable capital\" and \"constant capital\" somewhere else and that my definition does not account for them. Luckily it's not like I've read a great deal yet so it should be easy to backtrack and find where exactly I encountered the term.\n\n> However, Marx clearly categorizes the means of production and the raw materials as constant capital. So I'm inclined to believe that the quote is taken out of context.\n\nThe [_Wage Labour and Capital_ version on marxists.org](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/wage-labour/ch09.htm) doesn't include \"constant capital\" anywhere. And contextually, he speaks of a \"sum of commodities\" becoming an \"independent social power,\" that is, capital. He doesn't say \"sum of exchange values,\" which a single _sickle_ undeniably is, but \"sum of commodities,\" which in my mind a sickle _might_ be, but I'm not sure that it is.\n\n> Yeah I see what I missed. The keyword is the word preserving. The value of constant capital is preserved by labour and transferred to the finished product.\n\nBut as you said earlier, it is not necessarily the case that a single loom's value will be maintained, for instance. So what Marx is referring to as \"accumulated labour\" cannot refer to a single loom and instead it must be the entire mass of accumulated labour. I think my issue with your saying that \"a single sickle in the hands of a peasant is capital\" is in my insistence that a single loom (for instance) couldn't be capital on its own and therefore only the entire mass of \"constant capital\" must be considered here. What do you think?",

            "body": "Speaking as an engineer, it is a difficult and nuanced question to answer. Engineering has many different branches and I've seen arguments for and against defining Engineers as petite bourgeois. I will argue that Engineers are necessary laborers, and essential to a state to function if we want to do anything at a high volume (raw materials, manufacturing, power generation, transportation, digital communication, etc.) Being as crucial to a state as laborers, but being composed of a smaller population percentage than laborers, leads to Engineers being compensated well to keep their interests in line with more of the bourgeois. Engineers generally also participate in commodity fetishism just like laborers, whereas capitalists end up doing money fetishism. \n\nEvery company I've worked at made me sign instantly that anything I create or invent will be the sole property of the company and that anything I invent OUTSIDE of work, whilst being employed, is also the company's property. This sort of patent and idea hoarding by a parent company is obviously exploitive and is not talked about much in the industry, even though it is standard practice. Engineers generally, not always, come from a higher socioeconomic background since in order to be successful you need to perform well in high school to get accepted at a university and then perform well at a university without the normal distractions of life. Most of my colleagues did not have to work while in college, meanwhile I barely passed my classes because I was working and going to school at the same time. Then of course, in the US, you end up with around $100k or more in debt, that you need to then find a job to pay off that debt. \n\nAs an engineer in manufacturing, you can also seriously get hurt, just like laborers. Not all Engineers go to work in a white button up and sit in an air conditioned office all day. \n\nI have more to write about if others are interested, but I will say that engineers sell their labor and do not own their own property (ideas/inventions). As an engineer, industry hopping is very difficult, you often pigeon hole yourself in the first years of your career, after that you can not switch industries without exceptional effort. Whereas most laborers can switch and pick up a new trade as an apprentice. But of course there's debt to be paid off the the engineer.\n\nDisclaimer, I don't care about patents and I think all ideas should be publicly held but it is gross to see private corporations hoarding and profiting off of ideas of their employees.",

The dismissal of home loaners just further weakens the collective class and instead drives differences. Just because I have a mortgage does not mean I will profit off the exchange, I have the opportunity to sell the home for less than I bought it. It's only the bourgeois that see homes as a commodity to be bought and sold, so why don't you redirect your anger towards them?",

A renter never has that option for one absolutely all of the rent is entirely gone it's not put into equity. You are delusional about the actual class divides in \"working people\" I could quote Lenin and Marx at you where they talk about this but I won't bother your language is basically indistinguishable from liberalism now and that would be a waste of time.",
