This is my first post on this subreddit, so I hope I'm not breaking any rules.\n\nNot so differently from many of you, I am very depressed and feeling hopeless about the future. I'm a Marxist, so I've noticed a lot about the world, which also fuels my worries. \n\nI was wondering how you all cope with how awful the world is and how it often seems like we will never have a revolution and make it to a better future. I'm asking people who have similar views as me because we may understand eachother. Thank you!",

I find comfort in telling myself that the fruit from this fight is not for me to bear but for the people generations from now. How many generations from now? Who knows. But I hang on to that [what sometimes feels like pathetic] hope for dear life. \n\nMostly importantly, I evoke this hope through action. Find those actions you can incorporate into your lifestyle, and maybe it will evoke that hope in you too. Armchair Marxism will kill your soul. Action will relieve the pain through deliberate struggle.\n\nSometimes, I find myself still feeling empty even amidst consistent action. I remind myself that this is normal to feel because I am a human actively resisting the status quo which I've been conditioned to conform to\u2014conditioned to conform to either by social coercion or by necessity of survival. I also remind myself that through my active resistance, I am building the future for what will set the stage for an effective, global, militant revolution.\n\nRevolutionists Angela Davis, Paulo Freire, Fred Hampton, and Vladimir Lenin have brought me the most hope with their words. Find those voices who speak to you. Don't get comfortable with certain narratives. Keep seeking new voices. Lean into the painful knowledge of reality so that you may be equipped with this knowledge to change said reality.",

You need to consider your approach to praxis for yourself.\n\nBut I will say this: going down verbalist rabbit holes of Marxist studies ceases to be an effective means towards revolution if it is not simultaneously paired with action (re: \"Armchair Marxism\"). And, more pointedly to your reply, activism alone will cease to be an effective means towards revolution if your actions are not simultaneously carried out with critical self-reflection every step of the way.\n\nThe application of critical consciousness to action: this is praxis.\n\nFor me, it's dismantling the liberal presuppositions and cognitive dissonances that fester in my brain which defer me from joining global forces to enact the most effective, revolutionary tactics for abolition. It's also legal observing local actions, registering voters at my county's jail, and participating in theatre workshops at a state prison. My scope of understanding and executing praxis is limited\u2014I'm sure of it. I'm going through a weird incubation period where I'm critically reflecting how I got to this point as the organizations I'm primarily a part of are undoubtedly reformist and not revolutionist.\n\nFind what makes sense to you and build from there.",

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, every kind of miracle can be performed. \u2026 We believe that revolution can change everything, and that before long there will arise a new China with a big population and a great wealth of products, where life will be abundant and culture will flourish. **All pessimistic views are utterly groundless.**\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-4/mswv4_70.htm\n\n> EL DIARIO: Do you ever get depressed?\n\n> CHAIRMAN GONZALO: No. I believe that I\u2019ve got an almost built-in optimism. And I occupy myself more with problems of understanding and conviction than with problems of feelings or depression. On the contrary, I think that I am quite optimistic. It is Marxism, Chairman Mao, who has made us understand that people, especially communists, are optimists. Whenever I find myself in a difficult situation I strive to look for its positive aspect or for what potential for development may stillexist within that situation, because nothing is completely black, nor is anything completely red. Even if there were to be a big defeat, even though we have not had one yet, there would always be a positive aspect. The point is to draw out the lessons, and continue to do our work based on the positive aspect. You will always find someone to support you, to lend their ardent enthusiasm and assistance to the struggle, because communism unites people.\n\nhttp://www.redsun.org/pcp_doc/pcp_0788.htm\n\nThese aren\u2019t platitudes. When Mao and Gonzalo say these things, they are scientific, Marxist assessments. To say you\u2019re very depressed and feeling hopeless about the future ignores the truth in what they say.",

In both cases it appears to me to parasitically suck up to Proletarian struggle to selfishly and incorrectly relate OPs feelings of unknown origin to the revolutionary struggle (so that they could be feeling better about themselves), even though there is no true relation between the two.\nObviously there is nothing Marxist about feeling depressed but when optimism isn\u2019t grounded in real revolutionary struggle, then how is it any different? I think we would be much more sympathetic to OP if their depression came from failures or setbacks in concrete struggle they would be waging, but trying to turn one of the few Marxist places on this side of the internet into yet another para-social fandom leaves a very bad taste in my mouth, even though I feel bad for OP. \n\nI can\u2019t help but notice the similarity to that one thread about depression that got pinned for a while in which one frequent user deleted their account out of embarrassment after giving (to my understanding) similar advice to some depressed liberal and getting heavily criticized for it. I\u2019m not sure if I have internalized the lessons of that thread correctly but to me it seemed pretty significant in combating a crude, fetishized tendency of \u201cthird-worldism\u201c that has been lurking here for some time by exposing it to the scientific rigor of Marxism. \nI would be interested to hear your thoughts on this because I\u2019m not quite sure about this assessment.\n\nedit: After thinking about the two threads again, I believe the similarities are rather superficial and I already feel like deleting this comment. I\u2019m keeping it up so that maybe you or someone else can correct my mistakes.",

I hadn\u2019t seen that thread you linked but it seems to be basically deleted now so I couldn\u2019t graze much from it, but the response of u/urbaseddad and I comes from questioning the basis of being hopeless, again, over the future.\n\nTo be personal about myself, my own comment did come from a place of empathy, because the quotes I provided are ones I consider myself when I think about how grim the future might seem on first appearance.\n\nI do think that you raising the point that our optimism isn\u2019t grounded in revolutionary struggle is a good observation that I\u2019m not prepared to address, but what else would you suggest? That we be pessimists because it\u2019s more suited to our experiences? I have trouble agreeing with that.",

Accepting individuality, even if it goes against your ideals, is part of living in a world that\u2019s far more complicated than any single theory or system can explain. \n\nMaybe instead of waiting for a revolution that might never come, you could try focusing on what you can control, whether that\u2019s working within the current system or finding a way to balance your beliefs with the reality around you. It\u2019s not the answer you\u2019re hoping for, but it\u2019s probably more realistic than waiting for everyone to suddenly agree with you.\n\nI hope you\u2019re able to find a way through the depression you\u2019re feeling.
