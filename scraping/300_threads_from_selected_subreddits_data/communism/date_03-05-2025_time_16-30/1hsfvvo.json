            "body": "Just read through the programme of a new pre-party formation in Canada. Had a few questions going through it.\n\n>In applying Maoism to the conditions of Peru, the Communist Party of Peru produced Gonzalo Thought, which has further developed Maoism. Among its most important contributions have been the relation between the analysis (looking at the components of a thing in isolation) and the synthesis of a thing (how the components interact as a whole), the economics of bureaucrat capitalism, developments to the construction of the proletariat\u2019s weapons in the fight to seize power (the party, the army, and the united front), as well as developments to people\u2019s war. Gonzalo Thought emerged in the two-line struggle with various opportunist lines in Peru and internationally in the struggle against Avakianism, Prachandism, and today against the revisionism of the \u201cCommunist Party of the Philippines\u201d.\n\n1. This group has written a 5+ part series on Gonzalo thought [https://communistworkers.wordpress.com/2024/08/20/gonzalo-thought-communist-party-of-canada-red-fraction/](https://communistworkers.wordpress.com/2024/08/20/gonzalo-thought-communist-party-of-canada-red-fraction/) but just want to ask here - before I read it - if anyone has something more brief to say regarding what is Gonzalo thought, why has it been adopted in North America?\n2. Is there anything more substantive to the charge of revisionism against CPP other than that they have engaged in peace talks? [https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/18ggp0w/cpp\\_expose\\_afp\\_ploy\\_to\\_use\\_talks\\_of\\_peace\\_talks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/18ggp0w/cpp_expose_afp_ploy_to_use_talks_of_peace_talks/)\n\nSome points about the programme:\n\nThey regard \u201cfarmers\u201d and urban petit-bourgeoisie as a progressive class. \n\n>the Communist Party of Canada (Red Fraction) understands it to be the unity of the progressive classes of Canada (the proletariat, the semi-proletariat, the farmers, and the urban petite-bourgeoisie) against imperialism.\n\n>Where private property will remain for a long period is among the petite-bourgeoisie, mainly the farmers. This class can be won over to the socialist revolution, but they oppose outright nationalisation of their capital as it is against their class interests. The socialist revolution will preserve and strengthen the worker-farmer alliance. It will not develop antagonism between these two classes through the forced seizure of the farmers\u2019 property.\u00a0\n\nThe chauvinism is pretty boring and predictable. \n\n>However, over the course of the 1800s, British colonialism was abolished and an independent Canada was established. This was accomplished by a combination of military and legal-democratic struggles against British colonialism. Since 1867, there has been no legitimacy to claim the main fight of the Canadian people is for the development of the democratic revolution. While this process led to the liberation of the Quebecois nation and the Canadian nation, the bourgeoisie of these nations have taken up the reigns of colonialism from the British over the Acadians, Metis, Inuit, and the many nations regulated by the\u00a0Indian Act.\n\n>In Canada today, the main contradiction is with imperialism, principally Canadian imperialism. Quebecois imperialism is the most important secondary form of imperialism and is principal in Quebec. This contradiction manifests mainly in between the workers and the bourgeoisie and secondarily as the struggle between the oppressed nations within Canada against imperialism. Both of these struggles can only be resolved through a socialist people\u2019s war led by the reconstituted Communist Party of Canada\n\n\u2026.\n\n>Under Canada today, several nations are oppressed by imperialism. These nations include those regulated by the\u00a0Indian\u00a0Act, the Metis, the Inuit, the Acadians, with potentially some others. Unlike the Canadian and the Quebecois nations, these oppressed nations have been prevented from developing capitalism. What they have instead is a deformed capitalism born in the era of imperialism \u2013 bureaucrat capitalism. The imperialists have entered into an alliance with the ruling class of these nations to maintain bureaucrat capitalism and prevent a national capitalism from being developed. The bureaucrat capitalist nations are run by a big bourgeoisie made up of a faction based on state-monopolies (the dominant one among the nations regulated by the\u00a0Indian\u00a0Act) and a faction based on non-state monopolies (dominant among nations such as the Acadians). Bureaucrat capitalism exploits the proletariat and semi-proletariat, oppresses the farmers and petite-bourgeoisie, and restricts the middle capitalists.",

I was on Highway 2 recently, and within 50km of each other there were the following farmer billboards: \"Thank you Truckers\" (the anti-vaccination labour aristocratic protests), \"Axe the Tax\" (boring anti-Trudeau anti-Carbon Tax slogan), \"Google Flat Earth Canada!\" (sincere), and like at least three different \"fetuses are people\" anti-abortion billboards.  I can safely say Canadian farmers are one of the most reactionary formations on the continent (if you want to talk about exploited South Asian workers brought in to labour on many of the farms, great, but that's a different equation and needs to be expressed on those terms) -- the word socialist exists in hostile antagonism to these people.  They are as far from possible from being a progressive force to be won over.\n\nedit:\n\nI didn't realize that this was the CWF(OC)'s own attempt at a party.  It's a shame, because I thought a few of their members lurked here, and had hoped they had a better line on the labour aristocracy than the (N)CPC but instead all of these Canadian Maoist groups seem to carry with them the legacy of the RCP-PCR and all of them seem to be trying to re-create that organization over again, rather than taking a meaningfully different position on settler-colonialism and labour aristocracy, or even attempting to arrive at distinct new politics.",

Their blog only came my way during the Jay Watts sex-pest scandal way back when I was leaving the old, revisionist CPC, and so I had followed posts from their blog for a few years, and their articles get shared here frequently (less so as of late, and I have been poor at keeping up with them).  I was never a member of the RCP-PCR, so I really don't have much to offer there either (edit: Majestic gave a pretty good rundown in this thread).  Also, it might be my own lack of investigation to be blamed for my naive and optimistic outlook on the CWF(OC).  I went digging a bit to see if I could find something on the split in the RCP, and this article came up: https://communistworkers.wordpress.com/2021/05/29/criticize-jd-criticize-jmp/  \n\n>JMP has made a career out of presenting himself as a champion of the oppressed nations in Canada. This Canadian Avakian has led impotent cancel culture campaigns in Toronto against reactionary historians working from a colonial ideology, and he has tried to take credit for the realization of settler-colonialism as one of the fundamental contradictions in Canada. To this end, he has even taken to writing apologia on his blog for Settlers and other \u201cThird Worldist\u201d garbage published by Kersplebedeb.\n\nNot to defend Jay Moufwad-Paul, but the problems being brought out with the Red Fraction/CWF(OC) in this thread seem to have been there from the start.  (edit: they had [another article](https://communistworkers.wordpress.com/2022/06/08/learn-from-the-kanesatake-resistance-join-the-struggle-for-indigenous-liberation/) specifically arguing for heightened struggle against settler-colonialism, but I think at this point it's safe to say, at least in the Canadian context, that \"against settler-colonialism\" as a phrase is hollow and basically all revisionist orgs now claim to do it, and what is meant by that must be made concrete and evaluated).",

But is it really fair to say that MLMPM (what you're calling Gonzalo Thought) is what's reproducing these bad, chauvinistic lines?\n\nThere are plenty of purportedly Marxist-Leninist groups with racially chauvinistic lines, Maoist groups with trans/misogynistic lines, etc. And yet the blame can't fall on ML or MLM, but rather on (a) the class and national composition of these groups and (b) the underdevelopment of principled communist lines on gender and sex(uality). I think it's fair to say the same thing about MLMPM groups; yes, the Amerikan and German examples provide astonishingly bad examples of racial and gender chauvinism, but (unless we delve into liberal pseudo-psychoanalysis about the \"machismo of armed struggle\" or whatever, or we believe wreckers and CIA agents about Sendero murdering gays or whatever) I don't think that has much to do with Principally Maoism. If it's correct and universally valid (which, to be clear, I don't believe, since I think that any party proclaiming the universality of armed struggle must at least be able to analyze how the labor-aristocratic nature of the majority of first-world workers impacts the armed struggle) then it's correct and universally valid; if it's wrong, it's wrong for theoretical reasons rather than because of the behavior of the cadre of its parties or the lines they uphold.\n\nOr is your claim that it *is* the contributions of Chairman Gonzalo (the \"application of Gonzalo Thought\") that lead to things like ignoring the national question, workerism, and trans/misogyny?

As we on here know full well, it's far more likely that a proletarian or person from an oppressed nation will fight for their class interests than that a petit-bourgeois white person will commit class suicide. \n\n>I find it odd you keep bringing up queerness and gender when I didn't bring that up\u00a0*at all*\n\nYou didn't bring up the national question either, though, with regards to MLMPM revisionism. I wasn't sure which form of \"chauvinism\" you meant, and I assumed you might've been talking about gender chauvinism due to the fact that MLMPM groups are far from unique in dismissing the national question but their treatment of women (specifically but not exclusively trans women) is a departure from the rest of the left. Though maybe I'm mistaken about terminology and should've understood \"chauvinism\" to refer to national chauvinism specifically.\n\nI think that the main point of my comment still stands, and it wasn't a criticism of your conflation of MLMPM with Gonzalo Thought. You said that MLMPM's correctness is a secondary matter because it \"reproduces bad and chauvinist lines\"; I don't think that the specifics of Principally Maoism are what are reproducing those lines. Concepts such as *jefatura*, PPW's universality, and the concentric construction of the party are not what directly led the CR-CPUSA or the ICL to ignore the principality of the national question, nor are they irreconcilable with a correct line on the labor aristocracy and the liberation of oppressed nations. You could say that being attached to the universality of PPW inspired such incorrect analyses, but you could say the same thing about Marx and Lenin believing that a proletarian revolution was possible in the first world.",

They essentially asked for communists to lie to themselves about political conditions in order to be consistent with previous Marxist analysis of the city leading the countryside.\n\n\nhttps://www.prisoncensorship.info/archive/etext/countries/germany/imperialismoverthrown.html",

This raises many questions. Why the isolation of the Indigenous national bourgeoisie? If their opposition to colonialism is the deciding factor as it is presented by the \u201c(N)CPC\u201d, then why not the Acadian middle bourgeoisie? More importantly, is the revolution socialist or not? There are splits between the Indigenous national bourgeoisie with the big bourgeoisie that we can take advantage of, however this is distinct from an alliance with them. National liberation in these nations is no longer tied up with the democratic revolution as it was in the past or still is in oppressed nations overseas. It requires socialist revolution in the oppressed nations as in the rest of the country.\n\n>The development of Canadian and Quebecois imperialism and bureaucrat capitalism among the oppressed nations of Canada has led to a situation where the majority of Indigenous people today live off of the reserves. When we add to this number those who live on reserve, but where the reserve is urban such as the Tsawwassen, the Tsuut\u2019ina, and the Kanesatake reserves, then the number of Indigenous masses being principally exploited as workers in Canadian and Quebecois companies rises significantly. These workers are not fighting colonialism principally, they are fighting capitalist exploitation. To propose an alliance with the national bourgeoisie of these nations is detached from the reality of the situation and only serves to hold back the participation of the Indigenous workers in the fight for socialism. The \u201c(N)CPC\u2019s\u201d support for the formation of \u201crevolutionary representative associations of Indigenous peoples\u201d would mean the prevention of the Squamish workers in Vancouver from participating in workers\u2019 councils and socialism only to participate in the bourgeois councils of their nations. This approach to the oppressed nations in the midst of a socialist revolution was criticised by Stalin as follows:\n\n>\u201cAs to the other regions, their labouring elements have proved to be rather inert in the matter of the national movement. But the greater their inertia the greater was the activity displayed by the bourgeoisie. Nearly everywhere, in all the regions, bourgeois autonomous groups were formed which set up \u2018National Councils,\u2019 split their regions into separate national curiae, with national regiments, national budgets, etc., and thus turned their countries into arenas of national conflict and chauvinism. These autonomous groups (I am referring to the Tatar, Bashkir, Kirghiz, Georgian, Armenian and other \u201cNational Councils\u201d)\u2014all these \u2018National Councils\u2019 were out for one thing only, namely, to secure autonomy so that the central government should not interfere in their affairs and not control them. \u2018Give us autonomy and we shall recognize the central Soviet power, but we cannot recognize the local Soviets and they must not interfere in our affairs; we shall organize ourselves as we wish and can, and shall treat our national workers and peasants as we please.\u2019 That is the sort of autonomy\u2014essentially bourgeois in character\u2014aimed at by the bourgeoisie who demand full power over \u2018their\u2019 working people within the framework of autonomy.\u201d\n\n>Can there be any doubt that the relation between a federal socialist state and \u201crevolutionary representative associations of Indigenous peoples\u201d would not follow the same path as the \u201cnational councils\u201d described by Stalin?",

                            "body": "Perhaps I'm too jaded from my experience with Canadian communist orgs. The major orgs here are very small in terms of members. When I first started getting involved in communist orgs, membership was generally a mix of older, retired folks who had been in the org for decades and very young students, but the share of younger students/new communists was growing very quickly. \n\nThere's obviously nothing wrong with that, but many of the students were disillusioned social democrats who were drawn in by the fact that the major orgs were basically \"democratic socialist\" orgs (even if they were ostensibly Marxist-Leninist). Of course, the tendency of these younger members was to \"do things\" and social media meant a lot of these inexperienced communists had surface level understandings of the history of communist politics but not the theoretical understanding of it. Now, this obviously is antagonistic to the tenured party bureaucrats who are basically social democratic labour organizers, so it creates discord in the orgs and people get kicked out and angrily start their own \"fractions\" or join other orgs because, of course, they need to \"do something\". And as a result, you have people talking about \"revisionist coups\" but in reality it's just a handful of 20-something former NDP staffers who are fantasizing about being martyrs in a country where there is basically 0 political pressure on communists. And then once the conservative party wins the next election they'll be back knocking on doors for some left-liberal advocacy group.\n\nAnd it's petty bourgeois chauvinism because, well: \n\n>With respect to the united front, the Communist Party of Canada (Red Fraction) understands it to be the unity of the progressive classes of Canada (the proletariat, the semi-proletariat, the farmers, and the urban petite-bourgeoisie) against imperialism. Over the course of the seizure of power, the united front will transform itself into a workers\u2019 republic. The centre of the united front is the unity of the workers. This united front of the working-class is the basis for the creation of a worker-farmer alliance and unity with the urban petite-bourgeoisie.",
