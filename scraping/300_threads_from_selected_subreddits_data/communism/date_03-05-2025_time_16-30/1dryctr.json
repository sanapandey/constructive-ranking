You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/communism) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

            "body": "This is just liberal representation/identity politics. This first zine is a list of small biographies with a superficial reference to the persons disability. There\u2019s nothing about how each revolutionary\u2019s  disability influenced their theoretical perspectives or practical work. There\u2019s nothing on why we should reconsider an individuals historical contribution to proletarian revolution through the lens of their disability. There\u2019s nothing on why we need to reconsider the role of people with disabilities in a communist movement. What does this say about disability as a socially constructed category? How does it function under class society? How does it function under capitalism? What\u2019s the point of making this if you have nothing to say? You might as well just stick to writing \u201cgreat man theory\u201d picture books about historical figures who \u201covercame\u201d disability like this [one](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/extraordinary-people-with-disabilities-extraordinary-people_deborah-kent/633171/item/3864660/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=low_vol_backlist_standard_shopping_customer_acquisition&utm_adgroup=&utm_term=&utm_content=593118743925&gad_source=1#idiq=3864660&edition=2406344)",

This is intended to be a low-complexity introductory text for people to start learning about radical politics. Mostly for people already quite familiar with disability politics. Hence the simple definitions at the start and the basic reading list at the back, the content of which does cover all of the questions you raised. The high amount of visual content and the very short and admittedly shallow biographies without there to make the text more approachable and human-centred. You are most welcome to write something succinct that covers your concerns, I would be happy to include it. Particularly if you can keep it under 365 words and avoid using jargon.",

The book is semi autobiographical and it shows the depiction of a boy growing up in a budding Soviet Union. It was awarded the Order of Lenin at its time. The man, just like the author, too becomes disabled and the message becomes that everyone has a place in revolution.",
