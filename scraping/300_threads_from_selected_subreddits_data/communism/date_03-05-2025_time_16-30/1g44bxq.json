    "title": "\"On Authority\" by Engels is brilliantly clear (and SHORT). The main criticisms of it seem to come from anarchists saying Engels doesn't understand the nature of authority. But his \"why do they not confine themselves to crying out against political authority?\" is THE point that isn't well disputed.",

In class society, people will organize and the voice that is able to capture the class interest and lead them will be relied upon. The contradictions between the classes in society will result in either the bourgeoise continuing the subjugation, the proleteriat to their interests, or the proleteriat overthrow the bourgeoise to abolish class.",

I don't really understand why On Authority has become a part of the canon as a serious theoretical text.",
