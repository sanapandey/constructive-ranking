Or more specifically if you know about YCL in London? Or any other place in the UK\n\nAdvice may feature:\n\n1) How to commute\n2) How to raise points of discussion\n3) In practice how do these organisations work in achieving socialist goals and organising amongst working class people\n4) As a young woman is it safe for me to meet late, how do I check if it\u2019s genuine in terms of location and group? Should I go with someone else? \n5) Are there political divisions in ML groups which I will face? \n\nAnything else that you think is important.\n\n Thank you so much! I appreciate your input.\n\nVasilisa \ud83d\udea9\u2764\ufe0f",

You don't need r/communism for that, you can get advice on 1 and 4 on London specific subreddits and you'll figure out 2 in practice.\n\n\nAs for the rest of your post, perhaps let's start with the fact that your Instagram indicates you're not at all an ML but an anarchist, and that the CPB and YCL are not ML but revisionist. That's if we define ML to mean the actual revolutionary line within the global communist movement, although most if not all self proclaimed \"ML\" organizations today are revisionist in one way or another; the better organizations I've seen all proclaim themselves to be Marxist-Leninist-Maoist. Given these things, what urged you to join the YCL? Both specifically as the YCL and generally as a revisionist \"ML\" youth league.",
