You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Opposition MPs last week approved a significantly downsized budget plan through a parliamentary committee.\n\n>The opposition has slashed approximately 4.1tn won ($2.8bn) from Yoon\u2019s proposed 677tn won budget plan, cutting the government\u2019s reserve fund and activity budgets for Yoon\u2019s office, the prosecution, police and the state audit agency.\n\n>\u201cOur National Assembly has become a haven for criminals, a den of legislative dictatorship that seeks to paralyse the judicial and administrative systems and overturn our liberal democratic order,\u201d Yoon said.\n\n>Yoon, a former prosecutor, accused opposition lawmakers of cutting \u201call key budgets essential to the nation\u2019s core functions, such as combatting drug crimes and maintaining public security... turning the country into a drug haven and a state of public safety chaos.\u201d\n\n>The president went on to label the opposition, which holds a majority in the 300-member parliament, as \u201canti-state forces intent on overthrowing the regime\u201d.\n\n>Yoon described the imposition of martial law as \u201cinevitable to guarantee the continuity of a liberal South Korea,\u201d adding that it would not impact the country\u2019s foreign policy.\n\n>\u201cI will restore the country to normalcy by getting rid of anti-state forces as soon as possible,\u201d he said, without elaborating further other than the martial law in place.\n\n>He described the current situation as South Korea \u201con the verge of collapse, with the national assembly acting as a monster intent on bringing down liberal democracy\u201d.\n\n...\n\n>Following the martial law announcement, South Korea\u2019s military proclaimed that parliament and other political gatherings that could cause \u201csocial confusion\u201d would be suspended, according to Yonhap news agency, which is reporting that people who violate martial law can be arrested without warrant.\n\n...\n\n>\u201cPresident Yoon declared emergency martial law for no reason,\u201d Lee Jae-myung, who has branded the declaration unconstitutional, said. \u201cTanks, armored vehicles and soldiers with guns and swords will soon control the country.\u201d The last time martial law was declared in South Korea was in 1979, after the assassination of the then South Korean dictator Park Chung-hee, who had seized power in a military coup in 1961.\n\n...\n\n>South Korea\u2019s parliament, with 190 of its 300 members present, just passed a motion requiring the martial law declared by President Yoon Suk Yeol to be lifted.\n\n>All 190 lawmakers present voted to lift the measure...\n\n...\n\n>Update: South Korean military officials have said martial law will remain in effect until lifted by President Yoon Suk Yeol, according to local broadcaster YTN, other local media reports and Agence France-Presse, despite the parliament\u2019s vote to lift it.",

But I'm also not as well versed in the current politics of South Korea to cut to the essence of what is happening -- obviously I'm rather skeptical that the Democrat opposition are secretly DPRK supporters or whatever, but I don't have much deep insight beyond the surface observations at this moment.\n\nedit: The liberal narrative of it being some corrupt old man trying to hold onto power doesn't seem like a sufficient explanation for me either.  I suspect that is true, but not the full explanation for what is happening.",

The only reason why there was no coup is because the South Korean military wasn't bothered to commit to one, and because they weren't ordered to do so by the US",
