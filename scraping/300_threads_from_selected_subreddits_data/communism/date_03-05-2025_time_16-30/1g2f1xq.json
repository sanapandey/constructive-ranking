His government rejected the UNHRC resolution on accountability, war crimes and the human rights violations perpetrated by the Sri Lankan state. He appointed war criminals, who are even sanctioned by western countries, into his government. His party members even attacked the families of the disappeared who protested peacefully. His government maintains the militarization of the Tamil Homeland in some coastal areas it even increased.",

But your first mistake was to actually think about what he did after he served his purpose for Dengist content generation as the latest sign of the decline of the west and the rise of multipolarity and Chinese socialism.\n\nI know people are being dismissive of ever having taken him seriously but I sympathize. You were overwhelmed by the excitement and speed of this content creation and your desire for a better world was hijacked for ad clicks.\n\nSri Lanka has basically vanished from the collective \"breadtube\" hive mind until the legacy media finds a reason to talk about it again and then that discourse will be flipped and made \"dark.\" That is because content creation (defined broadly as all the \"meme\" subreddits, twitter posters, discord chats, etc) is parasitic on the media and lacks the ability to do anything but \"react.\" Serious engagement over a period of time, which is what it takes to apply historical materialism to a concrete situation, is structurally impossible.\n\nYour question is sort of like asking what happened to that guy who makes faces on tiktok in reaction to silly \"lifehacks\". He got some money for advertisements and everyone moved on to the next fleeting entertainment.1 But you should not feel stupid for caring about politics. They should feel stupid (or at least ashamed) for turning politics into just another empty signifier and market niche. Sri Lanka still exists and the hopes of the masses that were channeled and diffused into this nothing president are still there. But you'll have to find out yourself through serious study, it won't come in content form. I hope this experience of getting burned, first for taking this actually seriously and then being treated like some lame person who is still using last year's memes when you expect accountability, will help you in the long run be more skeptical before you are made a sucker.\n\n1.Maybe a better example is asking what happened to the \"drama\" about Mr. Beast. The answer is it was harvested for clicks on descending order of influence, starting with those who wish to replace Mr. Beast at the top through popular but niche \"drama\" channels to incel guy with a bad webcam. Once views started to go down, everyone moved on. But Mr. Beast really is exploiting children for free labor, stealing money from children through illegal gambling, hiring sex offenders and creating a dangerous, misogynistic, anti-labor workplace, and proving that *Squid Game,* which criticized for being too on the nose, was actually a documentary from the future. If you still care, you'll have to go forward on your own now without the momemtum of the algorithm behind you. But \"cancelling\" Mr. Beast wouldn't have done anything anyway, he'd just be replaced by the algorithm's next soulless husk of a person. The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.",
