    "selftext": "Sorry if this post isn't that well composed because I'm writing it with a racing heart.\n\nI just spent this Chinese New Year (not intentionally, just happened to be on CNY) reading and studying about the Malayan Emergency (1948\\~60) and I feel insanely depressed. What people in Malaysia (at least those where I live, and I live in the capital) think about communism and our former communist party is absolutely backwards.\n\nI'm a 17 year old living in Malaysia and I studied a lot about communism in other countries then felt it was weird that I didn't know much about my own. I think it's because, from what I knew then, the communist party was unsuccessful and violent. So I went on this subreddit and found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/s/uRZbPzQULO) about a video which I then watched.\n\nI learned so much that I didn't before, like how we had CONCENTRATION CAMPS!!! I cannot stress enough how surprised I was. I flipped through my textbook to see if we learned it (because I failed history twice) and it turns out we did but it was worded differently. They described it as \"new villages equipped with residential services, electricity supplies, water pipes, schools...\" and said it was built to \"protect the residents\" and just brushed off that they were forcibly moved there and didn't even mention when they were [massacred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batang_Kali_massacre) when they were suspected of aiding communists and \u2014 according to [the video](https://youtu.be/3isOX2TxfLo) \u2014 the women were harassed.\n\nThe main reason I wrote this post now was because I read [this report](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/malaysian-government-freezes-film-release-594881/) on how a film \u2014 and many others \u2014 were barred from being released. They said that a film talking about concentration camps was \"praising communism\" and that another film \"wasn't violent enough\".\n\nUndoubtedly, one big factor (aside from the constant propaganda and censorship) about why Malaysians view the communists this way is because most of them were ethnic Chinese and thus viewed as foreigers. If you asked any Malaysian, or at least Malay, who they think is the most even Malaysian person, they would probably say Chin Peng, the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Malaya and the commander of the guerrillas. They don't know his sacrifices or his bravery.\n\nI could talk more about why I love the communist party and their sacrifices but it would be way too long. But do ask if you are interested. I feel like when school opens in two weeks, I desperately need to have a conversation with a history teacher. Though, I would probably be reported in some way. I have yet to study about the [second emergency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_insurgency_in_Malaysia_(1968\u20131989)) and would love some resources.",

Just something I noticed, the Malaysian communists were rather conciliatory and pressured by the rightist(capitalist) faction in China to negotiate with the government. The British counter-insurgency in Malaysia and it's success has been used as the basis for bourgeois counter-insurgency strategy.\n\nThat aside, some other resources I'd try to salvage/look into is the archives of former revolutionary publications in Malay and Chinese. Like, \"Charn Yew Pau\", \"MCP Review\", \"Min Pao\", \"Min Sheng Pau\", \"Sin Min Chu\", etc... like archived works that hold them. There is also the revolution in Sarawak that lasted until the 1990s, that may be a place to look as well.\n\nA start, however, would probably be fundamental revolutionary theory(I suggest MLM Basic Course and Lenin's Karl Marx). One factor is constant propaganda and censorship, yes, but during the \"Malaysian Emergency\" the British and their puppets dedicating almost all their efforts to eliminating the communists. Yet communism was still popular and resistance persisted for quite a while. An understanding of Malaysia, with a class analysis(notably I have heard of apartheid and migration being a thing ), it's position in imperialism, the legacy of the communist movement(especially in places like Sarawak), etc... should be evaluated deeper to understand the basis of mainstream ideologies and anti-communism, as well as how to revive the MCP.\n\nMLM Basic Course:\n\n[https://foreignlanguages.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S01-MLM-Basic-Course-Revised-Edition-10th-Printing.pdf](https://foreignlanguages.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S01-MLM-Basic-Course-Revised-Edition-10th-Printing.pdf)\n\nLenin's \"Karl Marx\":\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/granat/index.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/granat/index.htm)",

This is mainly for my friends and other students in Malaysia and maybe Singapore whom are only taught about them as violent terrorists who were intimidating the public.\n\nChin Peng, the Secretary-General of the communist party during the emergency, was only 17 years old when he fought against the Japanese and only 24 when the emergency began. This means that he was a very respectable man for his age.\\[2\\]\n\nThere also were a lot of women who some comrades described as being terrifying and demanding as they were far tougher, physically and mentally.\\[1\\]\n\nThroughout the emergency, the British had a total of over 451,000 troops from East Africa, New Zealand, Fiji, and, of course, Britain but the guerrillas only had 5000 and only 3000 were active at any moment.\\[2\\]\\[3\\]\n\nThey spent most of the time in the jungle and so couldn't get as good medical attention as the British. They didn't have the same weapons with the technology of the British including tanks, planes, and submarines. They didn't have the resources to write collumns of propaganda and print it to the entire country.\\[2\\]\n\nDespite all this, they still managed to hold of for 12 years until the British eventually gave us independance. This means that they had to have had support from the people. This also means they couldn't have just terrorised the civillians because it would cost too much in terms of risk and resources for little benefit.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n1.

Grew up thinking the US was our friend ''the land of opportunities'' and Cuba was evil. After I learned about the history of my continent, how our people were brutally repressed and punished evrytime we wanted to write our own rules and break free from the tyranny that big US corporations imposed against our people, I was crashing tf out.
