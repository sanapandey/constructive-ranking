            "body": "It seems that Assad completely lost any support from even his formerly loyal base of petite-bourgeois entrepreneurs, industrialists and traders according to the article. This Brookings institute [article](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-caesar-act-and-a-pathway-out-of-conflict-in-syria/) (of course, ignore the faux concern for the Syrian masses from this parasite think tank) from 2020 also has some information on this.\n\nThe reconstruction economy will be lucrative for these classes, as the article mentions \"Syria has a huge, educated, relatively wealthy diaspora which will want to rebuild the country. They could be growing double digits for years,\"\n\nAnother important aspect is that the US Dollar can flow freely in the Syrian economy again, which wasn't the case during Assad's government, especially in the last few years. The sanction regime also did an effective job at intensifying the economic misery of Syria, but of course such articles only focus on petite-bourgeois and comprador bourgeois classes. Although, I am not well versed enough on this to talk about the bourgeoisie. It seems that towards the end of his government even formerly loyalist factions (Rami Makhlouf seemed to be a major turning point, or at least the straw that broke the camels back) turned against him. It is now less surprising to me that his downfall was so swift\n\nTo reiterate, the 2019 Caesar Act (signed by Trump, and its architects were Syrian diaspora, namely Syrian Emergency Task Force) was devastating to the Syrian economy. Now with the HTS fascists taking over Syria, they will focus on changing Syria to a 'free market system' and inviting foreign investment.\n\nThe sheer incompetence (for the lack of a better word) of Assad to manage the economy against severe sanctions is clear. I am not 100% sure on this, but I would not be surprised if his neoliberalisation policies (carrying on from his predecessor) is what opened up the potential for Amerikan sanctions to do such damage in the first place. How can you open up Syria to the global imperialist finance capital and then be surprised that Amerika used that system to destabilise your rule?\n\nThe one thing I don't understand though, is why Assad did not even budge to basic democratic and economic reforms and suppressed them with brutality. It's a classic Dengist thing to say \"the Syrian protests from 2011 and onwards are CIA psyops\", but it's not like the masses weren't suffering (I read an article that mentioned how a previously neutral Druze population started protesting Assad in 2020, iirc). What prevented Assad from even making basic welfare based reforms? Because \"Assad was just a psychotic maniac\" is of course a nonsense liberal answer. But I do not know enough about that to answer my question.",

                    "body": "Why are you parroting regime change propaganda?\n\n\u201c..it\u2019s necessary for us within the anti-imperialist space to study exactly why secular Syria wasn\u2019t a dictatorship, because in order to help change the future, we must not let imperialism control the past. When you honestly look at the history, it\u2019s clear that the perception of Assad as a despot was not the reality; and that therefore all the ostensibly pro-Palestine leftists who supported Assad\u2019s downfall did so for nothing. The only effect their actions had was to enable a massive expansion of Zionism\u2019s genocidal campaign, and assist imperialism\u2019s broader terror forces. This must be how the world remembers these events: as a story of betrayal, where Palestine\u2019s supposed allies enabled an imperial maneuver which led to many more lives being lost.\n\nAside from the chemical attack hoaxes, the notion that Assad stood against democracy is the primary justification for this regime change effort, and it will be what I focus on debunking. Given that secular Syria continued to hold elections after the conflict started, the notion that Assad was a \u201cdictator\u201d relies on the idea that these elections were fake. But the evidence from the last decade has shown that Assad put effort into including as many Syrians as possible within the democratic process; including the ones who were internally displaced, and therefore had experienced events which may make them alienated. Assad also allowed foreign observers, strengthening the argument that Vanessa Beeley made in favor of the 2016 election\u2019s legitimacy:\n\nContrary to spurious claims from western governments and media, efforts were made to open the voting to all Syrian civilians including those who have fled terrorists held areas. We must also bear in mind that over 90% of IDPs [Internally displaced persons] have fled to Government controlled areas, thus further discrediting claims that these elections are non representative\u2026As Professor Tim Anderson [who is in Syria to observe the elections as indeed he was in 2014] said: \u201cSyrian democracy needs no outside approval. Repeated outside demands that \u2018Assad must go\u2019, or that a Washington-approved executive \u2018transition government\u2019 be formed, have become meaningless, since the military tide turned in the embattled country\u2019s favour.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian elections proceeded according to the Syrian constitution and law. We see this being enforced in Aleppo for example where it was decided that violations of the voting process had taken place and a re-election was called for. UNSC [Security Council] resolution 2254 stated clearly that Syria\u2019s future is in the hands of the Syrians and the Syrians are proving that they are doing just that with little fuss but a lot of enthusiasm and determination to deny foreign intervention in their sovereign affairs.\u201d\n\nhttps://open.substack.com/pub/rainershea/p/the-democracy-that-was-just-destroyed?r=1iktwt&utm_medium=ios\n\nDemocracy in Syria is absolutely not as you have painted it. This happens when we have gaps in our understanding that pro regime change imperialist propaganda is ready to fill. Stephen Gowans \u2018Washington\u2019s Long War on Syria\u2019 is very helpful here, placing Syria (aka the Syrian Arab Republic) in context of it being the last pan-Arab socialist holdout, intolerably impenetrable to western capital.",

And are you seriously comparing Salafi sectarians to the Bolsheviks? The Bolsheviks tried to fight back against German incursions and their client states such as the Ukrainian People's Republic and the Freikorps-installed regimes in the Baltics, but they had to establish lines to negotiate an end of the fighting with the Germans because they were being invaded by the Entente and had to consolidate the revolution.\n\nThe Syrian ''revolution'' has apparently been successful, but neither the HTS nor the SNA care about Israeli invasion.

The collaboration of Afghan Maoists with the Mujahideen failed to materialise any revolutionary gains and only lead to the regression of conditions and a more hostile environment for socialists which means that it was the wrong policy; why shouldn't we be critical of what was clearly an incorrect line?\n\nThis is incomparable with liberal attacks on socialism. The October Revolution was a success that achieved the creation of a revolutionary society, even if the would later USSR fall. The failure of the USSR was moreso the result of the failures of the purges to lead to a cultural-revolution, and the backsliding of the democratic advances achieved by the Soviet masses in the 30s because of WW2 which lead to the takeover revisionism in the post-war period. But the USSR between its foundation until 1953, and even afterwards, was more advanced than what came before. The Maoists in Afghanistan failed to achieve anywhere near close to that, and we can only blame them and their decisions for that.",

I hope the Maoists have learned from their errors which it seems like they have based on their introspection, though they have a long way to go before they can launch a people's war.",

So a imperialist backed coup is progressive revolution? Is that why Biden 'loves' what HTS is saying so far? Is that why HTS spokesperson is giving an interview to a Zionist think tank differentiating the Aleppo attack from the October 7th operation?\n\nAlso the very premise you based off your initial comment is shaky. The fact that the local population of northern syria pressured the SDF Kurds doesn't mean that somehow that's anti imperialist. In 2019 the US openly allowed Turkey to attack and bomb SDF. Somehow you're using the US-Kurd-Turkey relationship as evidence for HTS being not that bad, but not the fact that Amerika and \"Israel\" openly backed the Assad coup and are doing a whitewashing propaganda campaign for the 'rebels'. \n\nEither way, I do want to know what you think about the first two questions.",

Sluggishly observing events *without* making \u201cvalue judgements\u201d is worthless. \n\nGiven the speed of its success, if the Syrian opposition had a primary interest in protecting its nation from imperialism it would have made extensive political and military preparations before Israel destroyed its assets and occupied its territory. It\u2019s sad that even imperialist France has made a (purely rhetorical) response against Israel while the rebels have said and done nothing. Syria will fall to sectarian violence and the divided masses will have to grasp for basic survival whatever petty organization is available.  \n\nMaking allusions to the Bolsheviks to obscure the fact that the rebels are reactionary, imperialist-backed shock troops is shameful. It\u2019s even more shameful to call the Maoist line during the Soviet-Afghan war progressive when history proved it incorrect so long ago.
