    "selftext": "I found this book in a used book store in North Hollywood CA. It is titled Whither and With Whom? By V. Bolshakov. \n\nI thought it gave a good Marxist perspective on the New Leftist movements in the 1960s-70s \nI really enjoyed him breaking down the American intelligentsia talking about if they\u2019re proletariat or not, and also analyzing the American petite bourgeoisie. \n\nI wanted to learn more about the author but after searching everywhere on the internet I can\u2019t find anything outside of small sites having the book and also finding one of his other works. \n\nThis book was first published in 1975 in the USSR and that\u2019s what really drove me to the book most. \n\nSo I ask, \n\nHas anybody heard of this book and the author? I will happily take all the information I can\n\n( I also recommend the book)\n",
