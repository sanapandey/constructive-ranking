    "selftext": "I found this interesting post about Democratic Kampuchea and Pol Pot in defense of their form of Marxism. I am curious to hear opinions as its a long article. It goes into the military, historic and political foundations of the revolution.   \n[Forty Years of the Democratic Kampuchea Victory! \u2013 Proletarian Revolution](https://proletarianrevolution.net/index.php?page=news&type=view&id=15)  \n\"In 1968, the Communist Party of Kampuchea, with strong peasant support, made the decision to unleash armed insurrections in several areas of the country following the strategy of the people\u2019s war. Since then, the communists develop their bases of support and expand their guerrilla bases.\n\nThe American imperialists, for their part, no longer withstanding Sihanouk\u2019s resistance to their policy, organize with the help of their servants Lon Nol and Prince Sirik Matak a coup against the government while Sihanouk was in France. Sihanouk is dismissed on March 18, 1970. This coup will result in the liberalization of the economy for the benefit of the United States and the establishment of a stronger support base to fight against the Vietnamese revolutionaries. Lon Nol troops support the American Marines in their war against Vietnam. In the interior of Cambodia they carry out massacres against the national minorities, in particular against the Vietnamese, but this base of support will be shown to be not very solid. Sihanouk, who had found refuge in the People\u2019s Republic of China, is going to call the armed resistance against the traitor Lon Nol, thereby expanding the resistance led by the Communist Party of Kampuchea.\n\nOn March 23, 1970, the National United Front of Kampuchea was created. Sihanouk announces that the only legitimate government is the Royal Government of the National Union of Kampuchea created on May 5, 1970. The Cambodian resistance will unleash a formidable popular war that neither the intervention of the US troops nor those of Saigon put his service will get her back. Intensive bombings that will reach their highest levels in 1973, spills of chemical products and numerous tons of nails in the rice fields \u2026 are some of the genocidal practices by which the US government will try to subdue a town of 8 million inhabitants. But the men and women of the resistance of the people, between the fires of war, organize agricultural cooperatives to face the needs of the front and the people and build factories of plowing and armament instruments as the liberated zones expanded. The most combative workers of the popular struggles join the resistance.\"  \n",

The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them.
