A favourable balance of such forces may or may not be ratified by the majority vote of either a universal or a class exclusive electoral body at a given time. Regardless, to see the result of the vote and not the balance of forces as the determining factor is to fall victim to democratic metaphysics in theory and to the violence of the counter-revolution in practice.\"",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I wish at least one of these people had the guts to actually say this to the face of a Palestinian and not in the good company of other white settlers. Obviously no one is bold enough to apply this to a retrospective historical analysis of the Algerian liberation, either.\n\nWhat's interesting is that Zionist narratives about the \"religious\" or \"ethnic\" nature of the conflict are currently so pervasive yet all of this is going to be completely discarded in the garbage bin of history after these points are no longer relevant to upholding settlerism. The French settlers made all the exact same arguments for how they are \"native\" to Algeria, how they have a \"deep connection\" to the land, how they are defending themselves against \"islamism\" and \"ethnic violence\" etc. yet this is barely even remembered as it is all obviously objectively untrue and those people's grandchildren have no interest in defending these narratives now that their oppressor class interest no longer hinges on it.",

How many white French people have any interest in trading their French passport for an Algerian one, living in the same neighborhoods as the Algerian masses and being paid an average Algerian salary of around 2,802 euros annually? Obviously the answer is zero, French people aren't even interested in the prospect of living in Algeria as a privileged \"digital nomad\" with a first world income. The reason there are still settlers in South Africa is because they are still squatting on a disproportionate share of the country's wealth and resources but being reduced to equal socioeconomic status and living conditions as that of the Zulu or Xhosa masses is unthinkable to them and they will all vacate the country long before that happens. Attacking indigenous people for being unfairly \"sectarian\" and exclusionary towards the settlers who want nothing to do with them and will ditch the country for elsewhere in the imperial core the moment they are actually forced to live alongside their former colonial subjects as equals is the position of someone who, if not performing vulgar apologia for settler colonialism, is profoundly detached from reality. In this case it is obviously the former as they directly clarify that what they are complaining about is Hamas killing a small number of Zionist soldiers and reservists during the historic Al Aqsa Flood operation.",
