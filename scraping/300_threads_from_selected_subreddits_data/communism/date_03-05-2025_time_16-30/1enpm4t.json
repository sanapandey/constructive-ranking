    "selftext": "There is a theory that during the cold war, the capitalist Western European states (and other western countries like Canada, Australia, etc.) had to develop several social programs in order to \"bribe\" their citizens to not side with the USSR. Such as giving out free education, free healthcare, free public housing, etc.\n\nNow that the USSR has collapsed in Europe, the West has no incentive to give its citizens these benefits, because where else could you go? There's no USSR anymore.\n\nI can see most of these social programs gradually being reduced and defunded, or only made to be available to \\~5% of the population. Some programs may be scrapped altogether. It would be logical since the West would rather use that money on foregn imperial wars than on their own people.\n\nAs such, since the government has 0 reason for bribing the public by offering generous social programs that makes life better, it essentially makes any new social programs impossible to implement. Such as with universal public healthcare in the USA.\n\nWhat are your opinions about this idea, and is there any truth to it?",

Yes fear may have played a role in their imperialist adjacent ruling class\u2019 decision to give concessions, but really tho, any tangible labor gains, in the west or anywhere else, are almost always the product of growing class consciousness + solidarity coupled with hard fought struggle. To simplify it down to their proximity to socialist nations is a textbook reactionary way of looking at things and honestly, quite insulting to the legacy of those workers who fought tooth and nail for those concessions.",

            "body": "I perceive this notion as idealist, which is why it is so propagated by opportunists and revisionists. These social welfare programs and more generally the welfare state that characterizes the modern hegemonic imperialist states started to form around the second half of the 19th century long before the October Revolution. \n\nThe precursor I believe was Bismarck's Germany, during the process of German reunification and it's rise to the status of great imperialist power but soon it started to emerge in the other imperialist states as well and reached full maturity in the post WW2 period. Social welfare, high paying jobs for life and low price of housing and other commodities characterized this period and is the reason why it's called the \"miraculous\". It occurred in most modern hegemonic imperialist states in the same period between 1950 to the late 1970s.\n\n The rise of the welfare state therefore coincides with the expansion of the labor aristocracy and petty bourgeoisie in imperialist nations and we can conclude that it is financed in the same fashion, through imperialist super profits. So the question is should we continue to refer to this as a \"bribe\"? Lenin of course did so several times but in his time the labor aristocracy was not fully formed as class yet, only a minority of workers in hegemonic imperialist nations were bourgeoisified. \n\nI believe that if communists continue to refer to this process as a bribe we end up propagating this idealist notion that the labor aristocracy and the welfare state exist because a portion of the ruling bourgeoisie decided it was necessary to starve off revolution and as soon as the threat of \"communism\" passed they started to undo it. This is not how politics or economics work. The ruling class can't control things to this level and can't coordinate on such a fashion, the capitalist system operates autonomously. \n\nTherefore the labor aristocracy and the welfare state in hegemonic imperialist nations arose because it became possible in a period in time in witch the super profits were plentiful enough to sustain such a large number people to reap more value than they produce through their own labor. This of course is still true to this day but there has been an overall erosion of the benefits that this class enjoys and this is a result of the waning of imperialist superprofits as a result of inter imperialist competition as well the tendency of the rate of profit to fall not the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThis is why China's relative rise to the status of imperialist contender will not bring back the same plentiful benefits that were once afforded to the labor aristocracy through the welfare state or other means as it is not possible to do so. In fact competition from China will result in a further diminishing of benefits. There is simply not enough profit to go around anymore and attempting to resurrect the welfare state fully would only lead to further economic degeneration through stagflation as was already beginning to occur in the 1970s. The neoliberal turn of the 1980s allowed the capitalist system to reinvigorate itself and the entry of China into the world economy as a source of cheap exploited labor was essential to this as simply eroding the welfare state would have been insufficient.",
