    "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI'm 30, from M\u00e9xico and I had never been really active in politics, my family is middle-upper class (probably upper class until 2008 crash). Dad is super right wing, he comes from a middle class family and made his money on his own, mom is recently more on left side, she comes from an upper class family. I have a brother that is really into politics, he is definitely pro marx. \n\nAll my life I\u2019ve been interested in puzzles (conspiracy theories, history) but in an entirely geeky way, I don\u2019t know if i'm explaining myself jaja. Like, I\u2019ve never felt morally or passionately driven to be a part of it. I just loved to understand it. (Like I am 100% convinced 9/11 was planned to explode islamophobia and go to the middle east BUT I HAD NEVER looked at it from a geoeconomic-anticommunism side) And about 8 months ago I started researching about US history and oh sh*t! What a journey I was about to embark on. So after going through Hawaii, guatemala, chile, bolivia, argentina DAMN EVEN M\u00c9XICO. Something really changed. \n\nI started to look at things in a different way and decided to be active on politics and to really open my eyes to what\u2019s happening in the world. \n\nI have been looking at capitalism, socialism & communism, researching a lot. I think I would definitely relate to marxism, i'm reading the manifesto right now for the first time, it is crazy to me that something written in 1848 will be the base of a 2450 society (if we get there). \n\nOne think I\u2019ve realized is that for some reason if you are defending communism you have to be 1000000x more studied than if you are defending capitalism. \n\nCan I get recommendations on youtube channels where I can find non biased or pro capitalist news? \n\nI thought i was good on finding things until I started researching for good content about communism around the world and history. 90% of the content out there is definitely capitalist propaganda it\u2019s crazy. \n\n\nAnyways, sorry for the long post. \nCheers!",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That is something you should keep in mind. In addition, it's only \"easier\" to defend capitalism for some people because they don't feel the immediate oppression and exploitation from it(or are oppressors themselves) and it is obscured through culture, media, etc... It is pretty blatant for most people in the world that capitalism-imperialism doesn't serve them.",

                            "body": "No problem. Given you are in Mexico, something that may be relevant is also the Chicano Nation.\n\nIt's a nation that began to form under the Spanish Empire, separately from Mexico but with similar ancestry. After invasion and occupation by Amerika, it now makes up the territory of Southwestern USA. It's important for those in Mexico because of potential(and historic, i.e. during the Mexican Revolution) cross-border organizing and the recent migration into the nation from South and Central America. The revolutions in Mexico and the Chicano Nation seem to be interconnected, given both historic ties and proximity to Amerika.\n\nThe following text goes into detail about the Chicano Nation, and also the history of Mexico, and is relatively introductory. Another work that goes into deeper detail Chicano Power and the Struggle for Aztlan.\n\nReport to the Communist Collective of the Chicano Nation on the Chicano National-Colonial Question \\[August 1972-April 1973\\]\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-1a/cccn/index.htm](https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-1a/cccn/index.htm)\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso, I sort of rescind my initial suggestion about getting started. I think that this is a introductory better resource: [https://foreignlanguages.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S01-MLM-Basic-Course-Revised-Edition-10th-Printing.pdf](https://foreignlanguages.press/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S01-MLM-Basic-Course-Revised-Edition-10th-Printing.pdf)\n\nIt's a basic course on used by the revolutionary party in India that's waging a people's war. If you want to read into topics more specifically, there are texts referenced. I'd also suggest using Tor or some secure way to access this stuff.",
