                    "body": ">I am anxious about the state of the People's War in these areas, and the understandable lack of information that comes out of the situation just adds on to that stress.\n\nI believe that this \"worrying\" about class struggle and the state of the PPW is largely a result of one's own petty-bourgeois/bourgeois class position, especially when one hasn't declassed themselves or haven't started organising at all. I am in the same position. It is a reaction to our non-involvement in such matters and the continued bombardment of state media about how the cpi maoist is all but finished. Like a guilty conscience hanging over our thoughts. That if we don't do something very quickly then all is lost. The solution is obviously to throw oneself into the struggle. But the how is something that everyone needs to figure out on an individual basis i guess (If anyone has any more ideas, please critique this). I believe this is also something that DaalKulak had highlighted to me. \n\n>What is to be done in the Urban context to support the peasantry in this case?\n\nI think this is again a manifestation of the \"worrying\" factor. During my short stint with an organisation in Delhi, there was a friendly banter between two people on whether everyone (from the cities) should be sent to Bastar to engage with the PLGA . There is an implicit tendency i think that people when they think of the \"urban context\" imagine only the petty-bourgeois populace as constituting the urban spaces. While the real potential is not in the tech parks but the working class colonies around it. Most of the populace that resides in the urban spaces belongs to such classes and that is where the organising should begin even if without the mention of Maoism at first. Ultimately, while it becomes necessary to send people from urban areas to the Bastars, the organising must begin in the city itself. The urban perspective document highlights what can be done in a very lucid manner, which i believe you must already be familiar with. \n\n>Might be a naive question, but does 'awareness' matter here?\n\nHow do you define awareness? And whose awareness?\n\nMentioning u/DaalKulak in case they have anything to add.\n\nEdit:\n\n> The history of Adivasi resistance that is mentioned in the statement does continue to inspire confidence.\n\nI think you could also refer to Bhattacharya's Storming the Gates of Heaven to understand the history of cpi maoist and how even after Steeplechase the smaller pockets/groups emerged into this party. \n\nAlso, the recent bandh by the party brought even Chaibasa's (a relatively known town in my state) transport to a halt:\n\n https://www.redspark.nu/en/peoples-war/bandh-called-by-cpi-maoist-brings-life-to-a-halt-in-kolhan-division/",

I believe this is also something that DaalKulak had highlighted to me.\n\nI think people have to take initiative regardless of class background. An active effort has to be put into understanding the main barriers to engaging in revolution, why they exist, what enables them, and how to surpass them. As Sakai said, a lone revolutionary is like a lone firefighter, they can't do anything. So it doesn't mean that individuals should isolate themselves and do tasks like that but actively seek out ways to assist revolutionary struggle across the world in any way that they can.\n\nThere are different kinds of worrying, the kind of worrying that comes from those outside of the PPW oftentimes looks similar to worrying about the outcome of a soccer match because you put a certain amount of money one way. The revolutionary party has plenty of people who are actively engaged in armed struggle with bases of their own, with an on the ground understanding of the situation. All of these questions, even ones on urban areas, are actively being worked on and tackled. For those outside of India and outside of the areas the party is most active, all that can be done is learning from their experiences then taking the initiative to engage in struggle wherever you are. If someone was actually engaging in struggle on the ground, these questions would not be on reddit but actively discussed with the masses involved. For the masses engaged in struggle, their worries would be actively taken into consideration before operations.",

                            "body": "I understand what you are saying and mostly agree with it. It's funny because I've said the same thing to others who question the functioning of the Maoists and express doomerism. Perhaps I felt to ask the same because of the intensification of the fascist assault against the people's war and its willingness to kill anyone that isn't even involved directly with the people's war. Still, your point stands, just wanted to give context I guess.\n\nWith regards to the urban context, you are right but I am not referring to tech parks and the urban petty-bourgeoisie when I talk about it. I am talking about organising the working class like you said (and also the lumpenproletariat, although I do not know much about them as a class: I mean in terms of their class consciousness and their role in revolution). But again, the question goes back to something you asked recently, how do we combat revisionism and defeat the strong presence of parties like CPI (Marxist) in these working class colonies you talk about (at least based on my experiences, revisionist organisations have a firm standing).\n\nRegardless, I will be honest and say it is difficult to keep myself from worrying. My worry does not matter, I guess I am projecting my own guilt of being a petty-bourgeois wealthy student and not \"doing\" anything, which in itself is a good internal justification to not do anything. Guilt was part of my radicalising process, but it's also in a way a coping mechanism so I can still live a materially comfortable life. It's quite pathetic but I have to move on and work with it. Thanks for your comment though, you did hit the nail on the head.\n\nShould just go read the classic texts instead of spending time on this subreddit tbh.\n\nE: Thanks for linking the article about the bandh. A reality check but also incredibly inspiring.",

Workers are protesting overdue wages and demanding social security and stable jobs.\n\nThe strikers are mainly agricultural labourers who play a major role in rural development. They are guaranteed only 200 days annual employment.\n\n[https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2024/07/26/cjrt-j26.html](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2024/07/26/cjrt-j26.html)",

MNREGA is a major welfare program but which is slowly being killed off in line with the state's withdrawal from its welfare role. Each year the real budgetary allocation is reduced and with integration of a non-viable IT component for wages and other critical aspects of the program along with AADHAR card registration (which is laden with another set of problems in itself - non-enrolment of people, extreme laxity in terms of privacy, et cetera) the program is on its way to its deathbed. You just need to google it and its all there. This was the last resort for peasants as the agricultural sector is in decline with extremely low productivity. While agriculture engages half of the working population, they are facing continual pauperization as the cost of production is more than the returns. Thanks to WTO, now even subsidies and the main subsidies' body FCI are en route to being abolished - the former through DBT mechanism and the latter through legislation. All so that FMCG groups can milk the agriculture sector here with their own selective crops which they will force the peasants to grow.",
