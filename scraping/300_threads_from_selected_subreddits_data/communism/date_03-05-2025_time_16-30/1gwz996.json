You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/communism) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

            "body": "They're all bad since the goal is to try to purge Althusser of \"Stalinism,\" his stubborn committment to science and Engels' supposed 19th century epistemology, and save the contradictions that come from his own political opportunism and petty-bourgeois class consciousness that are useful to liberalism and discard those which are not. Liberals were doing this during his lifetime (like Ranciere) and it's recently become popular more broadly.\n\n>I chose Althusser's text \"ideology and the State\" to write an essay on for a course, though I missed the lecture discussing this text. I find it interesting enough to write my essay about despite having missed the lecture.\n\nWe don't care about your homework. Read Althusser because you want to apply the lessons of Marxism-Leninism to the present or don't bother, you already missed the boat of academia.",

The essay itself is pretty easy to understand in my opinion, but if you want further context on it I'd say just read the book, \"On the Reproduction of Capitalism.\" There's a non-scholarly article I really enjoyed here\u00a0http://www.critical-theory.com/reproduction-capitalism-critical-theory-guide/",
