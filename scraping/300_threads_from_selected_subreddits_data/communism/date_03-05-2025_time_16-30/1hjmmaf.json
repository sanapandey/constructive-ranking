Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them.

            "body": "I was going to ask about this when it happened, but it slipped my mind; better late than never, especially since the contradictions in play remain identical. While I understand that the imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports by US imperialism is a manifestation of the increasing inter-imperialist contradictions between US and Chinese imperialism over access to markets, what is the logic behind Trump's recent announcement of tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports, given that the aforementioned contradiction is not active in these cases?\n\nClearly, US Imperialism is in a process of ditching its prior tendency of neo-liberalism for a protectionism with regards to critical commodities for imperialism and other commodities high in the value chain that I've heard referred to as \"neo-mercantilism\"; the tariff on Mexico seems to be principally for the purpose of reducing the sale of Mexican-produced cars as opposed to US ones, and therefore seems pretty consistent with this. At the same time, though, US imperialism has begun to export increasing amounts of capital into Mexico over the past several years in order to make up for its losses in China, including for auto production. There seems to be a contradiction here, between this tendency and the announced tariffs, possibly indicating the nature of the internal contradictions within the US bourgeoisie right now. It's probably worth mentioning that Biden was heavily associated with the section of the auto bourgeoisie which is exporting its capital to Mexico, while Trump's most important bourgeois supporter in the auto industry (Musk) is principally invested in US production. I still don't understand the logic behind the Canada tariff, though, and I suspect that it involves a different area of commodity production (oil is my first guess, but I have a very meager understanding of the contradictions which define oil production).",

But I'm really interested as to where the widespread misunderstanding of the term \"commodity fetishism\" comes from. I think, especially outside this subreddit but also from users on here, I've seen it misused (twisted into some synonym for \"personal identity that you buy things for\", or assumed to be a diagnosis of some capitalist sexuality, or any number of abuses) just as badly as that one Marx quote about \"hard-won hard-earned property\" or Lenin in *What is To Be Done?* advocating for joining the Democrats.\n\nThis probably has something to do with the modern usage of the term \"fetishism\" but it seems far-fetched to me that that's *all* the issue is, when the term is relatively important to understanding any Marxist critique of political economy. Was there some \"breadtuber\" or meme that this semantic shift stemmed from? Is this purely an \"online problem\", or does it date back to the personal-political lifestyle politics of the 80s and 90s?\n\nE: removed a sentence that I already don't agree with three minutes after writing it; I don't think there's any such thing as communists being \"too concerned\" with hot-button social issues, since Marxism can't be reduced to nothing but political economy.",

I feel like I spent a lot of my adolescence aiming towards ideal of a communist mentality, but now that I\u2019m here and doing the work I can\u2019t help but notice that there\u2019s just a feeling of detachment with my own body. I\u2019m going to die someday, and I\u2019d like to feel some fulfillment from life. Right now, I just feel run down and exhausted. Desire itself feels abstract and foreign. Desire has nothing to do with communism, but I am a communist, and so (because I spent so many of my developmental years probably misunderstanding all of this) I don\u2019t really desire anything. I\u2019m a historical character playing my role, and that is all that there is. \n\nMy question can take two forms, pick whichever you find more interesting: How do I cope with this? or; What does a healthy sense of self look like and how do I begin establishing it?",

            "body": "I was wondering what people had to say on patriarchy in America (and I guess the first world). To make myself absolutely clear, I am well aware it still exists.\n\nI was just wondering how y'all thought things would change over time. I recently discovered that apparently women have been excelling in education and have been more successful finding jobs than men as the decades have passed (I've heard that this applies to the US and a couple other European countries). This means that there has been a rise in single young men who don't have jobs (and are apparently not even looking?!). Single makes sense because women have an increased ability to provide for themselves, so the need for marriage or looking for a partner is not as strong as it used to be. I'm not sure how to explain the latter though. I think it is incorrect to argue that men or women have an innate advantage in intelligence over the other.\n\nRegardless, with the enormous rise of white collar work in the post-1945 era, I think this could have provided the groundwork for women to strike back with a kick in the balls as they are able to break into sectors more easily (the ones where physically demanding work is not required, but blue collar jobs have been shrinking rapidly anyway).\n\nThese are scattered thoughts. Was wondering what all the stuff I said would mean for the future prospects of patriarchy in America in the future, but first and foremost I think it's important to figure out why these trends exist to begin with.\n\nEdit: attaching an article which can give more context/numbers to some of the facts that I mentioned.\n\n[https://spartanshield.org/42176/feature/its-a-girls-world/](https://spartanshield.org/42176/feature/its-a-girls-world/)\n\nEdit 2: Just going to further develop my ideas. The trends that I have mentioned in this post also coincide with high (and rising) addiction and suicide rates compared to women. I think this is because of increased despair and is an indicator that men are losing their traditional place in American society as women now compete for the same jobs as them and can sustain themselves without the need for male \"breadwinners.\" This of course has led to a lot of jealousy/resentment against women (hence why phenomena like incels are on the rise as well as other influential figures in the \"manosphere\"). I wonder then to what extent the concept of \"womb envy\", as suggested by Karen Horny, is a very real phenomena.\n\nThis is something that this article below vaguely touches on, which I think is interesting, but I think is very reductionist.\n\n[https://www.theringer.com/2024/10/11/politics/united-states-young-men-women-political-divide-richard-reeves](https://www.theringer.com/2024/10/11/politics/united-states-young-men-women-political-divide-richard-reeves)\n\n>What I meant by that is that the most important glue that many of us have to community, to our own sense of ourselves is, I think, needed-ness\u2014that\u2019s a horrible word. But I\u2019ve come to believe that feeling unneeded, feeling surplus to requirements is actually in some cases literally fatal.\n\n>But I think even away from the most tragic frontiers of unneeded-ness, which is suicide, what you see among a lot of young men\u2014and you see it in the friendship statistics that you\u2019re interested in, you see it in some of the drug addiction, you see it in the lack of geographical mobility, you see it in a whole series of social and economic trends\u2014**is just this uncertainty that there are social institutions out there needing you to lock into them, right?**\n\nIt then goes onto say that one aspect in which women can feel this feeling of being needed more just from their own biology:\n\n>But at least at some level, I think women have a pretty strong sense that they\u2019re going to be needed at the very least by their children, to bring life into the world. I\u2019m not in any way suggesting that you are not an amazingly important father. But to some extent, even fatherhood is a bit more of a social institution. It\u2019s a bit newer; it\u2019s a bit more constructed. And so I think that those institutional frameworks through which particularly male needed-ness is communicated and glued are even more important.\n\nThough, I am not sure if I agree that this is true. I am not sure if the assumption is true that women themselves feel needed because they can bring children into the world, but this is at least is something that lives in the imaginations of some men who look at women's success and their own failures and feel inadequate or \"unnecessary.\" This can lead men into the \"manosphere\" in order to feel like they belong somewhere in society because they feel like they are simultaneously losing their place in it as women are able to advance. This I think leads to a contradiction in that the very thing that men do to feel like they belong in society (to be the embodiment of masculinity) is made unnecessary as women advance and can provide for themselves, hence I think why the term \"toxic masculinity\" exists (masculinity taken to toxic, unnecessary levels).\n\nI have seen liberals argue \"toxic masculinity\" and patriarchy harm both women AND men because of all these things I mentioned (if patriarchy was good for men, why are all these metrics going up that show men are in despair?). I think this is wrong. This is like arguing that racism sucks for everybody involved (both white and black people), which is kind of the argument that the movie \"This is England\" tries to make which I think is funny/strange. No, I'd argue that patriarchy is completely in the interests of men and only serves to benefit them. Men go to toxic masculinity not because they are secretly victims of the patriarchy, but because this is their last ditch attempt at preserving it. The high suicide/addiction rates from men are signs of their own despair as the patriarchy is being eroded away.",

                            "body": "I think it's likely only within Euro-Amerikan society (perhaps generalizable to other oppressor nations). \nThe \"supplementary\" status of women's wages compared to men's - where women have been relegated to unskilled and semi-skilled labour has declined. You can see that in the declining gender pay gap. https://www.assemble.inc/blog/how-the-gender-wage-gap-has-changed-over-the-last-40-years\n\n>1980-1984: Women earn 64.2% of men's wages\n>2020-2021: Women earn 82.4% of men's wages\n\nBroken down by race: https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/03/01/the-enduring-grip-of-the-gender-pay-gap/\n\n>In 2022, Black women earned 70% as much as White men and Hispanic women earned only 65% as much. The ratio for White women stood at 83%, about the same as the earnings gap overall, while Asian women were closer to parity with White men, making 93% as much.\n\nSame with domestic work https://news.gallup.com/poll/283979/women-handle-main-household-tasks.aspx:\n>Although women remain more likely than men to perform most of the duties at home, this has declined in some cases over the past two decades. Since 1996, women have become less likely to be the primary partner handling grocery shopping (down 14 percentage points), laundry (down 12 points), cooking (down 12 points), dishwashing (down 11 points) and cleaning (down nine points). These shifts are accompanied by some combination of increases in the percentage of men primarily performing the tasks or sharing the work equally with their partners.\n\nAgain, the caveat here is that where domestic work isn\u2019t being shared between amerikan partners, it\u2019s being purchased via (overwhelmingly women) migrant workers. If in the future, white families have a harder time affording purchased domestic labour, we could predict a re-emergence of this contradiction between white men and women. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4287087\n\n>Demand for paid care in private homes has grown because of the increasingly tight time constraints of working-age parents who are employed full-time. Rather than the care of young children, it is particularly care for the sick and elderly that is being purchased externally. As shown in Figure 1, the absolute number of domestic workers in the U.S. has risen steadily, from 1.7 million in 2003 to almost 2.5 million by 2019.2 Growth in the number of home health aides, especially those who are employed by an agency, accounts for all of this increase. Both the share and the absolute number of nannies, housecleaners, and home-based daycare providers have fallen over time. By 2019, agency-based home health aides comprised 58% of all domestic workers, up from just 35% in 2003. In contrast, the proportion of domestic workers employed as home-based daycare providers dropped from about one quarter to 11% during the period, reflecting both the decline in the absolute number of home daycare providers and the large increase in the number of home health aides.\n\nThe sex industry, another important area of the patriarchal division of labour, is where this becomes more complicated. \n\nOf course, oppressed nation women bear the brunt of prostitution and sex trafficking, with the buyers being white men. https://rights4girls.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Racial-Disparties-FactSheet-_Jan-2021.pdf\n\nBut on OnlyFans, the ratio is flipped, with White content-creators making the majority. The ratio of women to men content-creators is 70/30, but if patriarchy is being done away with among white people, we could expect that ratio to even out over time - with more white men seeing OnlyFans creation as a possibility and necessity, and more white women consuming that content.",
