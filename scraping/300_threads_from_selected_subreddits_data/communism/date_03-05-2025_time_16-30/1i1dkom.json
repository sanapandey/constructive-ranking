            "body": "Yeah, if the last 30 years haven't said anything, the investors interested in funding environmental work are disproportionately going to be \"land developers\" or some variation of big financial capital people. I don't think this should overshadow the positive change though; this work helps make land usable, so the future generations beyond us will still have safe land to use. From experience in my hometown, these \"land developers\" just end up sitting on the land doing nothing for 15+ years, waiting for the next real estate bubble to sell big. Most people in the US are reaping some money from imperialism, whether it's the first-inline capitalists or their employees, or even further down. Our system is ingrained in imperialism, so really, I don't think you should worry too much about that part, because we know all their little tricks and know who really benefits here.\u00a0",

He clearly states out how capitalism's inner dynamics (mainly maximizing profits) always leads to further destruction of the ecology. Even making something (let's say the production of energy) more \"green\" or \"efficient\" mostly leads to over using of that technique to further minimize costs to further maximize profits. This eventually leads to further consumption of materials and resources hence the further destruction of the ecological cycles.",

He started the journal Capitalism Nature Socialism, an important site of convergence between Red and Greens in the 80's/90's. A representative piece can be read [here](https://libcom.org/article/james-oconnors-second-contradiction-capitalism) on Libcom.  \n\nAnother near-modern thinker I'd recommend is Barry Commoner.[ Here's a good intro from Climate and Capitalism.](https://climateandcapitalism.com/2012/10/01/barry-commoner-1917-2012/)\n\nJason W Moore is another writer who is very helpful, specifically on this topic see Waste in the Limits to Capital: How Capitalism Lays Waste to the Web of Life, and Why It Can\u2019t Stop [here](https://jasonwmoore.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Moore-Waste-in-the-Limits-to-Capital-Emancipations-2022.pdf). Capitalism in the Web of Life is my north star for thinking but is known for its difficulty to understand on the first go.\n\nBiehl's Entropy of Capitalism is another great book I'd highly recommend. Should be on libgen.",

[Marx's Ecology](https://johnbellamyfoster.org/translated/pb0122/) uncovers Marx's texts on nature showing that Marx did not only examine production and consumption, but rather human's changing relationship to nature. So it's a good start. \n\nHe later developed the theory of metabolic rift from the writings of Karl Marx in their book Ecological Rift. Metabolic rift refers to the mode of social metabolism under capitalism and the irreparable damage caused by human labor.",

The goal of showing that Marxism always already had an ecological dimension was laudable (and necessary to rectify the red-green relationship) but began to reach levels of absurdity with both its dogmatism towards other streams of eco-Marxism as well as \u201c\u2026Marx would have surely been aware of \u2018x\u2019 scientist during his time in London\u201d. The MEGA project which Saito was involved with finally finished this race to the bottom of marxology. While Karl Marx\u2019s Ecosocialism was useful, I\u2019m way more ambivalent about Marx in the Anthropocene and the historical revisionist project of saying not only was Marx an ecosocialist but also a degrowther. Simultaneously Moore, who comes out of the metabolic rift \u2018school\u2019 goes on to develop a much more robust framework for understanding not rifts in the narrow sense but the specificities of the organization of humanity-in-nature/nature-in-humanity and the logic of capital in shaping this over the longue duree of history\u2014 not just rifts but shifts.",

I've been a communist since 2015 when I started university and am now a professional engineer. The main structuring force for your work will be government mandated requirements which offers a buffer from the direct mediation by capital, although you will face understaffed/under-resourced regulatory bodies and direction to only meet the bare minimum requirements (e.g. adding things like concrete caps and leaving be soil contaminants as long as exposure can be mitigated). There is a significant push by the ascendant far right to deregulate and this translates to the aforementioned under-resourced/understaffed issues in permitting and a constant back and forth (but what feels like a secular trend towards dereg) with administrations. Typically this work puts you in lower income areas adjacent to industrial sites as toxic plumes spread. Due to your degree/title you should have some autonomy for recommendations, although I assume you'll work under an environmental engineer.\n\nObjectively your work does detoxify the environment, the contamination of which is borne predominantly by the working class and oppressed peoples. This skillset will be necessary if/when a GND and green re-orientation of the economy occurs (whether post-revolution or under a progressive government).\n\nCapitalism is always looking for a free lunch -- whether using the environment as a sink elsewhere or looking for federal subsidies (or complete funding... superfund sites) to implement remediation/pollution control technology. Externalization of environmental costs is reaching its limit as environmental regulation is increasing in China (see for instance Operation Green Fence) and in the third world (sometimes via international agreements e.g. shipbreaking and the Hong Kong Convention) and the American bourgeois at least rhetorically is pushing for re-onshoring. Waste, toxins, and entropy will only further accumulate within the system with no new frontiers to exploit as a sink or site of cheap labor. You have a key social function in ensuring that this doesn't impact the health of our communities.",

I think remediation work for usable land is a complete necessity, whether for for-profit companies or not.

The current project is working on  the Joe Louis greenway. It\u2019s not entirely remediation-focused but it\u2019s a good example. \n\nYou make some good points, but nothing will always be a picture perfect capture of developments under capitalism. I try to stay away from absolute thinking like that it will \u2018always\u2019 serve capital more than humanity. Usually, yes, it will as the only principle of capitalism is to profit as much as possible. As long as there is community engagement taking place in these projects and follow-through to provide what the communities are asking for. \n\nIf your concern is that your work will enable exploitation, that much is essentially inescapable. We can only continue to struggle against the capitalist class. Continue your work, know who you\u2019re working for and where the money is coming from.",
