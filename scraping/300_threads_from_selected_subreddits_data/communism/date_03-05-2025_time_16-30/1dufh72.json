You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "I will leave two quotes here that will explain Marx and Engels' position on how one should act in the election of a bourgeois democracy, this will already answer how communists should behave and organize:\n\n>Complete abstention from political action is impossible. The abstentionist press participates in politics every day. It is only a question of how one does it, and of what politics one engages in. For the rest, to us abstention is impossible. The working-class party functions as a political party in most countries by now, and it is not for us to ruin it by preaching abstention. Living experience, the political oppression of the existing governments compels the workers to occupy themselves with politics whether they like it or not, be it for political or for social goals. To preach abstention to them is to throw them into the embrace of bourgeois politics. The morning after the Paris Commune, which has made proletarian political action an order of the day, abstention is entirely out of the question.\n\n>We want the abolition of classes. What is the means of achieving it? The only means is political domination of the proletariat. For all this, now that it is acknowledged by one and all, we are told not to meddle with politics. The abstentionists say they are revolutionaries, even revolutionaries par excellence. Yet revolution is a supreme political act and those who want revolution must also want the means of achieving it, that is, political action, which prepares the ground for revolution and provides the workers with the revolutionary training without which they are sure to become the dupes of the Favres and Pyats the morning after the battle. However, our politics must be working-class politics. The workers' party must never be the tagtail of any bourgeois party; it must be independent and have its goal and its own policy.\n\n>The political freedoms, the right of assembly and association, and the freedom of the press \u2014 those are our weapons. Are we to sit back and abstain while somebody tries to rob us of them? It is said that a political act on our part implies that we accept the exiting state of affairs. On the contrary, so long as this state of affairs offers us the means of protesting against it, our use of these means does not signify that we recognise the prevailing order.\n\n>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, \"Apropos Of Working-Class Political Action\".\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/09/21.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm)\n\n>Even where there is no prospect of achieving their election the workers must put up their own candidates to preserve their independence, to gauge their own strength and to bring their revolutionary position and party standpoint to public attention. They must not be led astray by the empty phrases of the democrats, who will maintain that the workers\u2019 candidates will split the democratic party and offer the forces of reaction the chance of victory. All such talk means, in the final analysis, that the proletariat is to be swindled. The progress which the proletarian party will make by operating independently in this way is infinitely more important than the disadvantages resulting from the presence of a few reactionaries in the representative body.\n\n>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels , \"Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League\"\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm)",

                            "body": "It aligns itself with the nascent imperialist powers Russia and China, which considering their Hoxhaist roots is kinda funny (and to be honest interesting; since it shows the inability of Hoxhaism to produce a revolutionary practice despite Hoxha historically being a decent anti-revisionist) since this stance is inseperable from Dengism. Of course this comes with all the revisionism and fascism typical to Dengism. CPGB-ML is also chauvinistic; it rejects the presence of a national question in the UK and denies the mass labor aristocracy thesis which of course is extremely important in the UK. Again, in essence inseperable from Dengism which is social fascist to its core. There's also their infamous patriarchal-chauvinistic stances on queer and trans people and their collaboration with all sorts of fascists, for example, in their internet activities, they collaborate with the known rapist and white supremacist Caleb Maupin and with fascist Alexander Mercouris, and in real life their WAP grouping involves both known revisionist and chauvinistic organizations and a literal fascist organisation in Spain, which again is a consequence of and inseperable from Dengism, but based on your gross post history you think these latter things are good. I knew you weren't asking the question in good faith to begin with and trying to do a gotcha at me, so I mostly wrote this for anyone else wondering and because I wanted to lay out my case against the CPGB-ML more clearly.",

MLs / revisionists are often explicit about the former (campism and patriarchal chauvinism) but not so much about the latter (defending rapists, white supremacists, national chauvinists and the mass LA) although they do actually do it even if not explicit. You on the other hand _are_ explicit about all of those. You are straight up a nazi, which of course is expected since the underlying logic between modern fascism and Dengism is the same.\n\n\nEdit: it's funny, you don't even seem to know the arguments of the people you think you're arguing against / are strawmanning. \"Gonzaloites\" for the most part reject the mass labor aristocracy thesis, it is mostly associated with the MIM, not with the RIM. But this is only one of your multiple strawmen as I mentioned.",

But the Greens are not an option for \"voting the furthest left posisble\". Greens are a pro-NATO party.\n\nTrying to push Labour left is a failed dead end the Left is doomed to repeat over and over and over. We are not concerned about building Social Democracy, we are not concerned about electoralism.\n\nOur goal is the destruction of the British state and NATO infrastructure and whatever weakens that. Whether that supporting groups like Palestine Action, the most militant parts of the trade union movement or legal forces that undermine the British state from within.\n\nOur aim in the imperial core should be to build an anti-war movement uniting marginal prolaterian forces (really, the only proletariat in this country are those who don't receive welfare from the British state - seasonal workers) and the most progressive parts of the Labour Aristocracy in the Trotskyist-Union Beuorocracy camp.\n\nThere are several social-democratic mps that can be used to our movement's advantage. Not because they \"advance the platform of socialism\" (...) or \"spread [irrecognisably revisionist] marxism\" (...) but because several social-democratic mps have historically been instrumental in providing a front for armed-reformist/ revolutionary social-democrat counterparts like the ANC, PIRA and Fatah - inviting them into parliament, making legal defence of their activities. That cannot be said about peitie bourgeois parties like the Greens who don't even have a connection into the unions.\n\nIn the words of (the much more badass younger) Diane Abbot regarding the PIRA: \"A defeat for the British state would be a great liberation, a great move forward\"",
