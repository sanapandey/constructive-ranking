The left party \"Die Linke\" being a bit the exception but it also already rather a social democratic party. Other parties are: DKP(the oldest of the active parties), SDAJ(unaffiliated youth org of DKP, seem to be quite good), RKP(soon to be founded), KP(founded in June, Former KO, have great Material and yt imo), MLPD(might have confused sth but I think they were Russia defendants). Maybe I have missed some, but those are the one that come to mind rn. \nI am also rather new in all this, but I hope this helped :)",
