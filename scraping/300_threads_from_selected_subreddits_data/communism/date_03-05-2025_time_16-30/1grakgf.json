No matter how much factual evidence you present, no matter how much you disprove their outrageous claim, capitalism is always the answer. How do you actually break through the blinders and propaganda and get people to start questioning their world view?",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "What are these \"public discussions?\" In my experience once you leave school and you stop arguing with your friends and family that doesn't really happen except when some loser comes and tries to bother your stand at a protest about Stalin. Obviously you ignore that person if you're serious.\n\nYou'll need to be more specific if you want a real answer rather than pats on the back for complaining. Who are you and what are you trying to accomplish? Who are you talking to and what is the context? If you're not working with a party then it's a waste of time and if your party has not taught you how to defend the party line it is not a party worth defending.\n\nE: people mean well but you can see how easily third worldism can become an excuse for political immaturity. If the OP is arguing online about socialism, getting annoying responses is not a sign of \"labor aristocracy\" except that everyone involved is a labor aristocrat because they can treat politics like a game. OP, I would take it more seriously if you are trying to unionize your workplace and the question of socialism came up but that's hard to imagine given you work in a petty-bourgeois field.",

Unfortunately Day's thesis eats itself, since it suffers from the same problem as the elite theory of brainwashing. Day is simply an elite who resists the temptation of \"licensing\" rather than propaganda but the rare ability to do so remains incomprehensible.\n\nThis problem is unresolvable because it is founded on a false premise: brainwashing itself is a vulgar abstraction which defers a concrete ideological impasse into a non-specific, \"meta\" discussion of the possibility of knowledge. Any discussion that takes place in the abstract terms set by the initial misdirection will be equally flawed. Ideology is always specific and critique can only respond to specific articulations. The OP wants to discuss \"propaganda\" in general because they failed to express themselves in a specific situation. I would imagine that all the liberals complaining that Americans are too stupid to vote for the Democrats rather than confront their concrete failures and the complex range of motivations and ideological misidentifications of real impasses would have delegitimized the whole thing but, in fact, American socialists are just liberals who decided liberals are themselves too stupid to appreciate their own interests. The fundamental logic is identical, if anything socialists are the true believers in liberalism (or at least \"anti-fascism\" directed at Trump) whereas liberals performatively get upset for a bit and go back to their lives.\n\nPlease don't group me in with that website, Day is a typical Dengist and grifter. I may ramble sometimes but I'm trying to pack a bunch of ideas together quickly, if questioned I've always at least attempted to do the reading. That essay has very little substance in many, many words and has a bunch of errors when it bothers to linger on a subject for too long. He's also a bad writer. That someone like Day treats vulgar third worldism as a great revelation should be enough to cast suspicion on its basic premises.\n\nE: I'll give you an example\n\n>Let us look at a specific example. A claim like \u201cThere\u2019s cultural genocide of Uyghurs in Xinjiang\u201d is simply unreal to most Westerners, close to pure gibberish. The words really refer to existing entities and geographies, but Westerners aren\u2019t familiar with them. The actual content of the utterance as it spills out is no more complex or nuanced than \u201cChina Bad,\u201d and the elementary mistakes people make when they write out statements of \u201csolidarity\u201d make that much clear. This is not a complaint that these people have not studied China enough \u2014 there\u2019s no reason to expect them to study China, and retrospectively I think to some extent it was a mistake to personally have spent so much time trying to teach them. It\u2019s instead an acknowledgment that they are eagerly wielding the accusation like a club, that they are in reality unconcerned with its truth-content, because it serves a social purpose.\n\nThis paragraph is nearly incomprehensible*. That sentence is not \"gibberish\" by any definition and \"Westerners\" are familiar with China, Xinjiang, and \"cultural genocide\" because it takes a single Google search to get a basic familiarity with the accusations. Even if \"they\" are not, the specific accusations come from bourgeois academics, news media, and government officials who can be accused of many things except ignorance of basic geography. Considering the point is supposed to be criticizing a theory of elitism, the arrogance of this paragraph is astounding. Overall this is a plagiarized point of Sartre's about fascism's indifference to truth. But Sartre's actual point is that fascism does have a purpose, just not one that is concerned with factuality, and that the conspiratorial figure of the Jewish does have a logic within the function of fascism. All of this is lost when your object of scorn is \"westerners\" (of which Day obviously is one) and instead you end up with your own conspiracy theory:\n\n>Westerners want to believe that other places are worse off, exactly how Americans and Canadians perennially flatter themselves by attacking each others\u2019 decaying health-care systems, or how a divorcee might fantasize that their ex-lover\u2019s blooming love-life is secretly miserable. \n\nWhere we are now reduced to fantasizing about the secret pleasure of the other and their insincerity. This is also a basic contradiction, since \"unconcern\" and \"want to believe\" are not the same at all.\n\n*I genuinely have no idea what \"The actual content of the utterance as it spills out is no more complex or nuanced than \u201cChina Bad,\u201d and the elementary mistakes people make when they write out statements of \u201csolidarity\u201d make that much clear\" means or who or what is being referred to. \"China bad\" is not English.",

I believe I found that article some time ago from someone responding to a very similar post to this one and at the time sounded profound to me. I need to reconsider what is written in that article and why I myself bought into it.\n\n>Please don't group me in with that website, Day is a typical Dengist and grifter.\n\nApologies for doing so. I am unfamiliar with Day and his writings past the one I linked; though I am glad you offered your take on that piece. I had not considered the problem with discussing why people buy into \"propaganda\" in generalized, abstract terms. It seems like \"propaganda\" is so general and non-specific it's not even worth discussing, you can only attempt to deconstruct why a belief is bought into when discussing a specific, concrete event/topic. Your point about Sartre on fascism clarifies this point (if I am understanding correctly).\n\nEdit: \n\n>Westerners want to believe that other places are worse off, exactly how Americans and Canadians perennially flatter themselves by attacking each others\u2019 decaying health-care systems, or how a divorcee might fantasize that their ex-lover\u2019s blooming love-life is secretly miserable.\n\nWhen I first read this article, I didn't think anything of this statement, now I see how deeply flawed this is. This reads like his own surface deep conspiracy that reduces American chauvinism down to \"my thing is better then your thing\" rather than a real material reason.",

                                    "body": "The Uyghur situation is exactly as China says it is. Capitalist restoration was a regionally uneven phenomenon which, among other things, required the destruction of the economic system of planned, decentralized agricultural production specifically designed to counteract regional underdevelopment. In most of the country, after an initial period of petty production based on the privatization of rural industry built up during the socialist period (what became the TVEs), shock therapy was implemented, regional capital destroyed, and hundreds of millions of people flooded the coastal SZEs and became the workforce for export to the entire world.\n\nWestern China was too far from this to develop a new regional bourgeoisie in concert with the national bourgeoisie on the East Coast. It didn't help that Xinjiang already had a prior national consciousness built during the de-facto Soviet occupation that saw rejoining China as a step backwards. This regional elite consciousness was suppressed under Mao but Deng had to work with whatever bourgeois reactionary forces were present so decollectivization always took regional, opportunistic forms. This was made even worse when Xinjiang was offered by China to the CIA as part of anti-soviet maneuvering in the 1980s vis-a-vis Afghanistan. That is why most of Western China is underdeveloped but only Xinjiang has a powerful separatist movement. \n\nThis was good enough for the Chinese bourgeoisie until a few things happened: the export model reached its limits, oil and other resources were discovered in Southern Xinjiang (which is where the majority of the Uygher population lives - previously oil extraction was concentrated in the North as an inheritance from the Soviet period), and most importantly Xinjiang is right in the middle of the \"new silk road\" plans where Chinese overcapacity can be exported to other nations of the global South. This caused both state-backed attempts at developing the region and Han Chinese to migrate following the money (though this had been happening for decades it had again mostly remained limited to the North).\n\nThe Chinese bourgeoisie knows one way of doing politics: proletarianizing the masses and subsidizing a petty-bourgeoisie layer. The same thing they did in every commune, though in Xinjiang the newly restored petty-bourgeoisie became merchants rather than kulaks. So they rounded a bunch of people up, gave them a bit of \"technical training\" so they could serve as a cheap labor force for capital flowing westward, cracked down on the nationalist consciousness they themselves had previously sustained in a crude way characteristic of all third world bourgeois dictatorships, and did a very bad job with selling all this with PR. \n\nAll of this will be a failure, Chinese capitalism is in decline and has no room for new populations. Without socialism, all that's left is a technocratic developmentalist ideology to justify the CCP's continued rule, and in its place (and to some extent at a grassroots level) it increasingly relies on neo-confucian culturalism, Han chauvanism, and other regressive ideologies that are gaining strength everywhere, not just China, and are an inevitable consequence of the void left behind by neoliberalism in politics.\n\nWith that out of the way these are not concentration camps, they are meant to train a workforce for economic investment exactly as they are advertised. Any \"excesses\" are the result of China's general poverty, the crudeness of the bourgeois dictatorship built rapidly by the capitalist roaders, and the specific form of regional corruption that was necessary for capitalist development on an export model.\n\nThey are not racially or religiously prejudiced by design, this is rather an accidental (but inevitable) side effect of capitalist restoration on top of a socialist nationalities policy and the regional consequences of economic \"reform\". That some Uyghurs would turn to a reactionary ideology as they lost their economic function is not surprising, I just said this ideology is a universal reaction to liberalism in a terminal death spiral. But the majority response is proletarian consciousness, split between the easier response of flight or passive, individualized resistance and the growing collective, class based resistance.\n\nChina makes for an easy target because it is one of the few places left with features of 20th century modernism, in this case a state power-capitalist development nexus. But the market serves the same function in training Kerala peasants to become foreign workers in the middle east. That's not only uncommented on, it's sometimes even called \"socialism.\" \n\nXinjiang is just a regional expression of a national restoration of capitalism over time and space, there's really nothing worth noting. Like do you care about the historical consciousness of inner Mongolians? It's fine to have your attention guided by bourgeois media but at the end of the process you have to question the investigation you just did and commit yourself to investigating things before they become \"important,\" not after. And I really don't care what Adrian Zenz says, there's more to life than \"debunking\" the same thing over and over again. Not that I think it's ok that the CIA is lying about China and trying to start WWIII, more that I don't think about what they say at all and, unfortunately, \"debunking\" has not proven to be a sufficient basis for politics beyond Marcyism.",

This is not to say that the situation has improved for Turkic Muslims. Many of the \u201ctraining facilities\u201d were merely converted into ordinary prisons. For those inmates who were released rather than formally becoming prisoners, the state has continued a policy of labor transfer under the guise of poverty alleviation campaigns, relocating Uyghur labor to factories across the country.\n\nhttps://chuangcn.org/2024/07/palestine-and-xinjiang-under-capitalist-rule/\n\nNo point in reading the rest of that article, just linking this bit.

People that still reap benefits and privileges from imperialism, will generally *never* be open to destroying a system that *directly* benefits them or *think* that it benefits them. In other words, they believe blurring class lines will strip themselves of the privileges they feel they *deserve*, through the use of capitalist exploitation, which through the socialist lense *is* unethical.
