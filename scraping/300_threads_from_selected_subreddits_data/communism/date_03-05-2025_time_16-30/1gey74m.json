    "selftext": "If I'm correctly understanding Marx and Engels, ideology arises when labor is divided and societies change from primitive communal living to class-based societies. Individuals are now assigned specific roles, leading them to lose a well-rounded understanding of their society. As a result, people become more one-dimensional, which limits their perception of reality. This shift becomes especially pronounced with the establishment of fixed social classes, where class interests and struggles begin to shape how people think and understand the world.\n\nIdeology then refers to this limited understanding of reality, which is complex and multifaceted. Among the different social classes, the proletariat has the unique ability to see beyond ideology because of its position and interests. As the last oppressed class, the proletariat aims to escape its exploitation and has a vested interest in dismantling the entire class system.\n\nIn striving for communism, essentially a society without classes, the proletariat can break free from its limitations. By achieving this liberation and destroying the bourgeois class society, it can eliminate the social foundations of ideology altogether. In a communist society, ideology will no longer hold power.\n\nIn this case then, should we say that communism is more a realization of a new social order, aimed at creating a classless society, rather than a fixed set of beliefs or ideas seen as a more or less coherent worldview of a specific class?",

You are referring to Marx and Engels\u2019 definition, but to quote the *Great Soviet Encyclopaedia*,\n\n>K. Marx and F. Engels did not apply the term ideology to their own system of views, but rather characterized Marxism as the scientific theory of socialism, organically linked with the proletariat\u2019s class struggle for liberation. The spread of Marxism and the rapid increase in its influence on the workers\u2019 movement led to a new interpretation of the concept of ideology in Marxist literature. V. I. Lenin expanded the concept of ideology, introducing the category of scientific ideology and pointing out that there were scientific elements in the systems of ideology preceding Marxism, but that only Marxism is a scientific ideology in the true sense.",

Contradiction is the source of ideology. Capitalism isn\u2019t an ideology, though a number of ideologies find their origin within it. \n\nYou are correct that communism is not an ideology. But neither is it a far-off ideal society. Marx and Engels are clear that, to them, communism is the real movement which seeks to destroy the existing order of things. It is within this movement in all its contradiction that ideologies will form, compete, be destroyed and reform themselves. Once communism is established, humanity will be free of oppression but not contradiction.\n\nI recommend that you read Barbara and Karen Fields book Racecraft. They focus on race, but in doing so they elaborate very clearly what ideology is in a Marxist sense. A useful metaphor they give in an interview is that of a centipede managing to walk even though it uses so many legs to do so. Humans must function in spite of all the contradictions that confront us. Ideology is what allows the centipede to walk with all of those crazy legs.",

It\u2019s not a wool pulled over one\u2019s eyes, though it can be manipulated and weaponized. It is as ever-changing as the shifting terrain of our lives. Ideology can more or less accurately map that terrain. An ideology which captures the realities of life within capitalism and draws the outline of a future beyond it is a weapon for the communist movement and one that we should sharpen until it is capable of shredding the fabric of capitalist society.",

So perhaps it's context. If I somehow found one of the few anarchists who actually still insisted on the violence involved in revolution I would present abolition as a better understanding as just wanton terrorism (in reality more than likely just graffiti or burning stuff) doesn't address the superstructural features of capitalism (which I assume is what Marx was getting at with that line).",
