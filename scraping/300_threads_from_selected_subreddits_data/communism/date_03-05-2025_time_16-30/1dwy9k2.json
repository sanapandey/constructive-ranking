    "selftext": "Hello comrades!\n\nI'm from Greece, and to make it clear, I started getting more interested in learning about communism and reading theory about a year ago. So, sorry if there is a clear answer to my question.\n\nSo. In Greece, by the start of this month, working 6 days a week is considered legal. And I had a chat with my father about that.\n\nHe told me that if the people just stopped working (or stopped paying the high electrical bills), as a protest. Then they would remove that law, and any bad law like that. \n\nOf course, he agrees with me that it is very hard for someone to just stop doing any of these things, because, of course, he would starve. But he insists that anyone that wouldn't stop doing any of these things, are cowards, liars, and traitors. Btw, he himself has stopped working from jobs in the past,(as a protest, or personal revolution) and for that times we would of course, got by harder.\n\nI dont agree with that logic, but the thing is, that I didn't know what to say to \"counter\" his words.\n\nSo. What are your thoughts on this topic? Will the denial of participation in the society solve anything, or at least be impactful? ",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "You're talking about general strikes, I think?\n\nGeneral strikes are incredibly effective methods of protest. If the working population stopped showing up to work entirely, the entire system would grind to a halt because in the end, the power lies with the workers. The workers control (but don't own) the means of production. I can't say how effective one person not showing up to work would be, I guess it depends on that persons job! \nBut if the workforce of a factory got together and went on strike, the bosses would be forced to adhere to their demands if they want to continue making profit.\n\nIf just one worker stopped showing up to work at the factory, chances are that person would be sanctioned or fired - that's why the collective force of workers is what will liberate us.\n\n\nSo your dad is right",

I'm a welshman, from a family of miners. Welsh miners went on strike during the later 1900s to demand the right to work, the right for a job. It's not a decision made flippantly, but one made because they have no other choice. It's strike or starve, so you may as well strike. Those that cross the picket line were considered scabs because they chose to support the mine owners instead of their fellow workers looking out for the collective interest. \nIf you take the side of your oppressors, I'd consider you a coward and a class traitor. A scab. If you don't then okay, but like I said - choose the side of your oppressors and you best get ready to hear choice words!",

As a country, Greece consumes more than they produce (is there anything made in Greece?) & have to borrowed from other countries. A big general strike will just make everyone starve.",

If nobody pays those bills anymore, the energy supplier will be in trouble.\n\nIt would not be a good idea to just start doing those things, and hope others join. There needs to be an organized movement first, with enough people agreeing that they want to strike. So the first step would be to join (or create if non exists) an organization that agitates for those, like a party or a union. Organizing and agitating first is not cowardly. But not organizing, or not taking part when it starts, would be so.",
