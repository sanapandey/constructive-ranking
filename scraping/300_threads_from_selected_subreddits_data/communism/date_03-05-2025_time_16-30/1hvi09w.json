And while there is plenty to criticize about the text, I have yet to see any convincing alternative theories to explain, well, the origins of the family, private property, and the state.  And I don't know of any alternative texts to read and recommend which approach the issue from a materialist perspective.  Thoughts?",

TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them.

For example, the idea that there was a strict division between male hunters and female gatherers, which was the basis of the idea that men had a monopoly over weapons, which they then used to enslave women, is no longer really supported. But in the main the work holds up as a materialist explanation for the origin of the family, private property, and the state, so I still recommend it.\n\nThe now defunct Red Fightback had some writing on this but I'm not sure if that's still published anywhere.",

            "body": "The Creation of Patriarchy by Gerda Lerner contains one of the best updates on several hypothesis proposed by Engels in The Origins of The Family. I especially like the book because it doesn\u2019t descend into anti-communism or liberalism to do so and retains a decidedly material analysis, based upon updates to our understanding of the period in question in the fields of anthropology and archeology. \n\nIn particular Engels as\u00adsumed a \u201cprimitive\u201d division of labor between the sexes.\n\nVia *Origins of the Family*\n>The man fights in the wars, goes hunting and fishing, procures the raw materials of food and the tools necessary for doing so. The woman looks after the house and the preparation of the food and clothing, cooks, weaves, sews. They are each master in their own sphere: the man in the forest, the woman in the house. Each is owner of the instruments which he or she makes and uses. . . . What is made and used in common is common property\u2014the house, the garden, the long boat.\n\nVia *The Creation of Patriarchy*\n> The ethnographic information on which he based these generalizations has been disproven. In most primitive societies of the past and in all hunting/gathering societies still existent today, women provide on the average 60 percent or more of the food. To do so they often range far from home, carrying their babies and children with them. Further, the assumption that there is one for\u00admula and one pattern for the sexual division of labor is erroneous. The particular work done by men and women has differed greatly in different cultures, largely depending on the ecological situation in which the people find themselves.\n\nIn addition I think the way in which she elaborates the way in which the family became - through spiritual traditions which were captured and appropriated by states - the building block of hierarchy. In such a way that factors not just antagonism but also the willing complicity by would-be-victims which as been part and parcel to so much of the perpetuation of harmful dynamics to this day. Engels\u2019 explanation relies a bit too much on the biological determinants IMO.",
