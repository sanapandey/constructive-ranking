    "selftext": "On the outset, they look like a typical revisionist party, which they probably are, with their praise of modern China's ''socialism'' and membership in reactionary alliances like the ICOR and WAP but what I find interesting is that they began as a explicitly social democratic organisation but officially transitioned into a Marxist Leninist party by 2019. [The CPK states](https://www.communistpartyofkenya.org/87-recent-news/250-history-and-class-analysis-of-kenyan-elections-dispatch) that this was possible due the efforts of he party's youth wing who ''came out and redeemed the dignity of the party and restored its lost glory'' which lead to ''debates'' about leftist ideology in the party, their political tradition hailing from underground student movements in Kenya during Moi's regime.\n\nI find it peculiar because the CPK is clearly limited by revisionism but it's usually the trend for revisionist organisations to abandon Marxism-Leninism and degrade into social democracy, but in Kenya, the situation is the opposite so far. It does make me curious about the direction of the party.\n\nI guess though, it says more about the revolutionary masses of Kenya that they were organised and powerful enough to pressure a Social Democratic party into formally abandoning its ideology in favour of Marxism Leninism at a time of global retreat for the communist movement; more than it says about the actual party itself, though perhaps there's potential for a progressive movement to spawn from it but I am not that familiar with the situation in Kenya.",

You can definitely see that in the statement, which portrays China's investment in Africa as an admirable, socialist advancement. \n\nAs you said, CPK is unique because it represents a shift from social democracy to revisionist MLism instead of the other way around. I think it means the aesthetics & rhetoric of social democracy are losing credibility and instead people have to appropriate from communism to justify their beliefs. Marx was quotemined in Lenin's time to justify revisionism; it's no surprise that today's revisionists would do the same to Lenin. \n\nAnd of course, there's likely particularities to Kenya that accelerates these trends, such as the SDP's connection to illegal communist movements and the pre-existing relationships between SDP and certain AES states (eg SDP and the Kenya-Cuba Friendship Society being chaired by the same guy).",

But it does matter to us, and the application of Marxism to Kenya provides universal lessons to Marxists everywhere. Take China for example, you could easily say \"who cares what Americans think about socialism in China\" - but whether an American understands the lessons of capitalist restoration in China can actually have a huge impact on what practice American communists take up at home (a Maoist practice or revisionist Dengism).\n\nYou as an individual might feel you are incapable of contributing anything of value to a discussion about Kenya, which is perfectly ok. Just say that instead of implying Kenya doesn't matter to us, and it's impossible for us to know anything about it which is just not true.",

My understanding is that \"Our Principle is that the Party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party.\" What the SRA does is arm white people in the complete absence of a party. Each member is made personally responsible for their own protection (in a classically private settler fashion). It is not an organization that provides the most basic community defence in that women or queer people are organized to defend themselves against patriarchal violence. Instead you get a fandom obsessing over collecting weapons, scopes and add-ons that will fail to protect even the people who own them. And of course it does not provide any organization or leadership that can subordinate the interests of settler women to those of New Afrikans.",

Discussing the validity of a Kenyan communist party from my position would be deeply unproductive, bordering on masturbatory.\n\nFirst off, unless you personally worked with your uncle in a lab to develop Agent Orange-you need to get over yourself. The simple fact that you and I are the beneficiaries of world imperialism as we exist in the imperialist sphere is what it is, basic fact.\n\nIt is not chastisement and certainly not an excuse to just give up on theoretical work-which is what you seem to be doing.\n\n>I advocate for arming trans and queer people in my community and train with firearms as a queer person. I do my best every day to improve the world around me with the cards I am given because doing otherwise would be selfish.\n\nNo one cares about whether you do charity work or arming queer folk out of a place of selflessness or vanity, like sure it's cool but you'll find that self-armament as your basis of politics will just lead to pointless murder at the hands of the police-no matter how much you wax poetics about trans liberation in the inevitable class struggle.\n\nBtw, if I say that I'm queer (I'm a raging bisexual), would you automatically give my assessment of politics more validity than if I were just cis cause if so, that's horrid and lazy and you'd have to reevaluate your politics if it is on a basis of scientific analysis or fear.",
