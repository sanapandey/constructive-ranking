You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If that's the case, I hope Palestinian communists can exploit Hamas' opportunism for their own gain, as the PFLP was able to do when the Syrian war first started.",

To your point about this exposing much of Hamas\u2019s cowardice (much like Gaza exposed Iran\u2019s cowardice, or the Donbas exposed Russia\u2019s) and revealing the necessity for proletarian internationalism, one need only see the PFLP\u2019s statements.\n\n>The Front stresses that the Zionist enemy\u2019s air strikes against Syria and its incursion into Syrian territory amount to a dangerous escalation in the aggression against the people and states of the region\n\n\u2026\n\n>The enemy is trying to take advantage of the phase of internal changes in Syria to achieve renewed goals of aggression against Syria and its people\n\nOne has to imagine this line will continue to gain support as Islamist collaboration with the IOF and Amerikan proxies persists (seeing the rebel forces as \u201cfellow nationalists\u201d rather than open compradors). The PFLP\u2019s refusal to follow this line is hopeful, I think, both for their read of the situation and the political strength within the coalition required to break with broad opportunism.",

History has shown time and time again what happens when the communist party subordinates itself to the nationalist bourgeoisie: either they get massacred like the communists in Iraq, Iran and Indonesia, they lose popular legitimacy when the bourgeois inevitably betrays the masses like the communists in Brazil and India, or they simply collapse along with the rest of the regime like the communists in Syria right now. On the other hand, the PFLP has courageously upheld an independent line, breaking with both Fatah and Hamas at various points in its history whilst still remaining committed to the broad anti-Zionist struggle. This was only possible because they never gave up arms and is the reason why they are still a significant force.",

Certain comments made in the Resistance News Network telegram imply such things.\n\nI know that feeling defeated or depressed by the losses taken by the Axis of Resistance in the last several months is characteristic of a very petit-bourgeois \"revolutionary cheerleading\" sentiment, but it's hard not to feel quite demoralized by such developments. Perhaps the reason that I'm feeling this way now, but am able to criticize the very same tendencies in people when it comes to, say, the Indian peoples' war, has to do with the fact that so many people who I formerly held as friendly acquaintances in my offline life are moralizing about or outright celebrating these losses.\n\nOf course, these developments are nothing more than manifestations of the very pressing contradictions among the people and among members of the resistance factions in the Middle East, particularly as pertains to the roles of religion and nationalism in progressive or revolutionary movements.",

For all we know, the Naxals are consolidating and slowly expanding; there's just far less information coming the war in India than the ones in Palestine and Lebanon which are more intense and are at a critical stage; it is a very fair assessment to make that the Axis of Resistance is on the retreat and will possibly collapse, with the assassinations of their greatest leaders like Haniyeh, Sinwar, and Nasrallah, the ceasefire in Lebanon which has relieved Israel of a front to fight, and the collapse of the Syrian government to fascist militants backed by America, Turkey, and Israel which will isolate Hezbollah and disrupt their logistical supply chains with Iran. Still, it's not a completely hopeless situation, the contradictions that are inherent to the oppressive constraints of capitalism will never be erased, a revolutionary negation will always present itself but you will have to be attentive when looking out for them.",

For all we know, the Naxals are consolidating and slowly expanding\n\nThis is an overtly broad and incorrect statement. The CPI Maoist has repeatedly stated that it is on a temporary setback in the last couple of years due to Operation Kagaar (2024) which is part of the larger Surajkund Offensive. At least read some of their latest statements before commenting.  Here is the relevant part from their latest statement:\n\n[https://maoistroad.blogspot.com/2024/12/cpi-maoist-let-us-celebrate-24th\\_11.html](https://maoistroad.blogspot.com/2024/12/cpi-maoist-let-us-celebrate-24th_11.html)\n\n\\>The extent and intensity of guerrilla war in the areas of the revolutionary movement lessened since the revolutionary movement of the country is in temporary setback for the past few years. Thus carpet security was consolidated in these areas.\n\nThis of course does not mean that they have given up or will not be able to rise up once again as they have done historically.",

            "body": "Reading bourgeois scholarship is such a frustrating experience. Everything is put in these conspiratorial tones where the obvious logic is explained in the words of the communist party, that is exactly what happens, and then the author goes: \"how did this happen?! It was completely arbitrary!\" An example that jumped out at me from *The Affirmative Action Empire*\n\n>Defense of latinization, then, was concentrated in the central soviet organs. \nThe attack on latinization came from local party leaders, who appealed to central party organs over the head of TsIK and the Soviet of Nationalities. The test case for the reversal of latinization proved to be the Kabardinian alphabet. VTsK NA was aware of the Kabardinians' desire to shift to Russian already in 1933 but successfully stalled action on it for three years.122 The Kabardinian party finally responded in March 1936 by sending a delegation to Moscow, who ostentatiously snubbed VTsK NA by refusing to meet with them and instead appealed directly to the party's Central Committee to approve a shift to Cyrillic. They apparently received unofficial encouragement, as on April 7, 1936 the Kabardinian-Balkar obkom voted to shift their alphabet to Russian. The Presidium of VTsK NA met on May 14 to discuss this development and divided over the issue. Three days later, however, they approved the shift.123 The reason for this concession soon became clear. The All-Union Orgburo had discussed the issue and backed the Kabardinian proposal. Among the materials supporting this decision was a blistering anti-Iatinization report from the head ofTsK's Scientific Department, K la. Bauman.124 The Soviet of Nationalities then quickly endorsed the shift on June 5, 1936, making Kabardinian the first Soviet language to be officially delatinized.125 \n\n>This decisive intervention of TsK on behalf of the Kabardinians might have been expected to start a stampede to Cyrillic. In fact, by mid-1937 only the small peoples of the north (in February 1937) had been shifted to Cyrillic, although the process had begun for the other North Caucasus peoples and for the small Siberian ethnicities: the Oirot, Khakassy, and Shortsy. The reversal of latinization, then, had been confined to the small ethnicities of the RSFSR, those whose native languages had in fact already failed to establish themselves as viable. As one Karachai delegate told the Soviet of Nationalities, \"The Karachai people are not only for the Russian alphabet, but for the Russian language. \"126 Thus, the explanation for shifting the Kabardianians was to make the Russian language and Russian culture more accessible to them. This, of course, had originally been the principal symbolic reason not to give them the Russian alphabet.\n\nSo basically there were attempts to spread a latin alphabet to small nations, eventually the party realized this hadn't worked in this instance, and it was abandoned to better correlate reality and policy.\n\nInstead, this straightforward course of events is made incomprehensible. It \"might have been expected to start a stampede to Cyrillic.\" Expected by whom? There was never any expectation that this specific policy would turn into an irrational reversal of the entire policy everywhere because that never happened. \"This, of course, had originally been the principal symbolic reason not to give them the Russian alphabet.\" Correct, because circumstances changed as was just acknowledged. The party \"ostentatiously\" snubbed those who presumably would have disagreed with them. Oh really, how did you make that determination? Were you there to observe their attitude? If the policy of latinization had continued, the USSR would of course be accused of ignoring the democratic aspirations of the people and the reality on the ground for an irrational utopianism. When it changed, the accusation is hypocricy and arbitrary, top-down shifts. Under no circumstance can policy accord with objective changes, having accomplished its main goals, or better responding to feedback. No one is allowed to change their mind, despite explaining exactly why they did. And those who refused to change their mind or had ideas that were suitable for one set of circumstances but not another can't be held accountable, instead they become examples of \"show trials\" meant to signal policy shifts according to whims from the center. Rather than, you know, actual trials where the accusations are laid out and the law enforced (that such trials had popular resonance, rather than being a sign of democracy, is turned into a nefarious aspect - again you can never win).\n\nInstead this becomes part of a \"great retreat\" where anyone who was formerly a purger is now a purgee. Only Stalin matters even though he consistently explained the continuities and changes in the nationalities policy again and again, and, as the book points out, was a consistent opponent of great Russian chauvanism his whole life.\n\nThis is just a minor example, the book is full of this as is all \"revisionist\" scholarship on socialist countries. Other than some facts and figures, all I've learned in these hundreds of pages is exactly what was said by those involved as their justification which accorded exactly with what occurred. This is basically Grover Furr's point so you really can just save time and read his \"meta\" analysis.",

I haven't gotten around to studying the details of the Latinization movement yet, but the impression I have is that the Latin script was seen as international (being common to all the most developed countries and being made progressively more widespread by colonialism), practical (for promoting literacy) and culturally neutral (as opposed to the Arabic script used by many Soviet languages, which was associated with Islam, and the Cyrillic script, which in the relevant national minority communities was associated with missionary Christianity).  Moreover, there was the example of Turkey, which had just switched from the Arabic to the Latin script.  The resolution that kicked things off notes that the Latinization measures were in accordance with the will of the workers and peasants of the concerned national minorities.\n\nhttps://docs.historyrussia.org/ru/nodes/136560-o-novom-latinizirovannom-alfavite-narodov-arabskoy-pismennosti-soyuza-ssr-post-tsik-i-snk-sssr-ot-7-viii-1929-g\n\nI'd be curious to see if this jibes with what smoke has been reading.\n\nAs for China, I talked a bit about it and some of the relevant questions here.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1bgjw6p/comment/kwscl0j/\n\nI still think this\n\n>Where is the balance between promoting the full development of the distinctive cultures of oppressed nations and erasing distinctions in favour of internationalism?\n\nis the fundamental question and is even more important in a world that is more and more dominated by English linguistic imperialism and where the principal contradiction is that between the imperialist and imperialized countries.",

            "body": "Seeing all over twitter \"leftists\" and \"communists\" (liberals at heart) cherish the syrian rebels taking over the country, is making me think of the way that the liberal ideology operates. What I find it to be common to the speeches of all of them, is this weird \"separation\" between two events that are obviously connected, making it seem like they are somehow disjointed and that they should be judged separately.\n\nFor example, they will say \"Assad was an authoritarian dictator who was torturing people in prison, etc. etc. and so it is good that he was deposed\".\n\nBut then (at least the more serious ones, I'm not even going to talk about those who believe -or pretend that they believe - that Syria will somehow be better under the \"rebels\") they will also say something like this: \"But it is very probable that the rebels will sell the country to the US, Israel or Turkey, so it was bad that the rebels took over, and it is likely (they don't like to speak with certainty, so has not to commit themselves) that Syria will not improve under them, and may even get worse.\"\n\nSo, in very general terms, we see the arguments being made boiling down to this: \"Assad being deposed was good\" but \"The rebels taking over is bad, and Syria will get worse under them\". And the \"line of action\" that somewhat follows this stupid logic is: \"We should support Assad being deposed, even thought we know that Syria will turn out worse under his successors!\".\n\nThis decomposition of two moments of an event that are only intelligible together (Assad being deposed only happened because the rebels took over) is so weird to me, but now that I think about it, I find it to be very frequent under liberal reasoning. I would say that it is connected to the liberal idea of how correct ideas form: We get the ideas from everyone (even fascists who must be accommodated in democracy!) and then we select the \"right\" ones, like picking the food we like from a buffet. There are two assumptions behind this liberal logic: that everyone is equally as capable of producing correct ideas, and so that everyone should be listen to (a random esoteric fascist is as likely to produce truths as a communist who studies society scientifically); and that truth is somehow always in the middle, that the \"free debate of ideas\" always produces a synthesis which will mix elements from both sides, thus one side can never be completely right.\n\nThis logic, very much present in \"leftists\" who reject \"taking sides in an inter-imperialist war\"*, means that in every scenario we should put ourselves \"above\" the events, choosing the good parts of either side and trying to find the truth as something somehow in the middle of the two sides. In this case, this means saying that both sides are bad, which means saying that both Assad and the rebels are equally bad. But this is no superation of the logic, it is only simple negation (saying that both are bad amounts to saying that both are right about calling the other bad, which means that the logic of finding truths in both sides is maintained!). That's why it is never truly possible for these type of leftists to support something, they always got to say that they CRITICALLY support X government, because, like I said, in the liberal reasoning no one can ever be completely right.\n\nI don't really know how to conclude this, but I would say that it is this disconnection between moments which allows liberals to support an event without having to bear responsibilities for it's consequences. As a final example: \"supporting freedom fighters against the totalitarian soviet-like regime in Afghanistan was good, but the establishment of the Taliban regime is awful and terrible (and seen as unpredictable!)\"\n\n*Im talking about those who see an inter-imperialist war in everything, who use the expression acritically, even those (luckily few) who see it in Palestine (mostly leftcoms).\n\nE: this of course is not the result of a rigorous study, just some random thoughts that I have been having over the last few days. I have made a few corrections on the text.",

The question is why?

The collapse of the Syrian system was so fast and so unexpected there wasn't even time for anti-imperialist street mobilizations and in its wake rightists have been reduced to pretending they knew the whole time that Assad was doomed (even though for 10 years they were convinced Syria was the key moment in the irreversible march towards \"multipolarity\"). Our opinions on Assad are already too late to matter and it's just as important to reflect on why that is the case rather than chastise our enemies for putting us in that situation. Internal contradictions are always primary.\n\nMy point is there is danger in turning contingent political judgements, whether they are right or not, into philosophical concepts about \"liberalism.\" \"Critical support\" is the opposite error from refusing to take a concrete position and you're conflating them into an amorphous ultra-leftism while in practice taking a rightist position.\n\n>it is this disconnection between moments which allows liberals to support an event without having to bear responsibilities for it's consequences\n\nThis is one of the key justifications for revisionism since a revolution is never guaranteed. Again, in your example there is a key difference between a failed revolution and a passive, rhetorical support for a clearly reactionary movement because \"anything can happen maybe? Be the change you wish to see.\" But this can easily spiral into critical support for just about anything since the consequences can always be worse.\n\nE: because there are no Internet spaces friendly to ultraleftism (the ultraleft subreddit is just a copy of \"EnoughCommieSpam\" and has no substance, the large majority of posters are just liberals who have no relationship to the left communist movement), it's rare to see it articulated clearly. The discussion here is enlightening\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1hbnyis/exclusive_syrias_new_rulers_back_shift_to/\n\nAnd u/CHN-f is a rare example of a Maoist from the 1970s who had to justify the PRC's increasingly horrible foreign policy plopped into the present. This is an important perspective because it will necessarily recur when the dichotomy between critical support and revolutionary fantasy remain the two options.",

I will give you my reasoning even if I understand it might not be that much interesting to someone on the outside.\n\n1- The Portuguese Communist Party is both in a decline (measured of course through bourgoise standarts* - loss in number of votes [in 2015 it had 8,3% and 440000 votes, in 2024 it had 3,17% and 205000 votes]; loss in the number of members, [2000 less members in the last 4 years]) and in an increasingly revisionist path. Last week the General Secretary appealed to the renovadores [renovators]  to return to the party. The reformadores were a group of rightists which left the party in around the year 2000 and form an organization. Among other things, they want the Communist Party to enter a coalition with other left wing forces, including the PS, Socialist Party (something similar to the Labour Party). They also want the party to abandon marxism-leninism and democratic centralism.\n\nhttps://www.publico.pt/2024/12/01/politica/noticia/paulo-raimundo-apela-regresso-renovadores-independentes-aproximaram-2114059\n\nhttps://rr.sapo.pt/noticia/politica/2024/12/10/carlos-brito-so-admite-regresso-se-pcp-abandonar-marxismo-leninismo/405168/\n\nAt the time, the party proceded well in expelling these revisionists. The fact that the communist party now wants these guys to return shows that they are willing to go further right to gather a few more votes/members/supporters.\n\n2- At the same time, and like I have mentioned in a previous discussion\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism/s/zqUE1sbJEo\n\nThe most active forces in criticizing the communist party right now is a leftcom organization. It is possible that they will form a party soon. Besides the revisionist PCP, all that there is is a few trotskyists and these leftcoms. I basically don't know anymore maoists, and I have talked to another user here and he said he was isolated too. I feel compelled to defend the PCP when the alternative are leftcoms who call Hamas a \"bourgeois-nationalist\" organization.I also don't feel threatened by the PCP's revisionism because, like I said, they are already falling without my help and it is very possible that the party will lose all parliamentary representation soon. This may be a poor judgement, but I feel it is more important to attack what is \"going up\" than what is \"going down\". The PCP has a very reduced influence among the masses right now, most of it's supporters are pensioners who are tied to the party since 74 and some middle-income public workers or other labor aristocrats. Of course, you could say the opposite, that leftcoms or trotskyists have even less (virtually zero) influence among the masses.\n\n>Critical support\" is the opposite error from refusing to take a concrete position and you're conflating them into an amorphous ultra-leftism while in practice taking a rightist position.\n\nIs it really? I think critical support is the distance that is given to a position in order to stay above concrete events, so in that sense the logic is maintained. The fact is that either all support is critical or no support is critical, the expression doesn't make sense. But I get what your saying: \"lesser evilism\" is in a way the opposite from, let's say, refusing to take a stance towards Palestine. But what I was criticizing specifically was the word \"Critical\" as a safeguard against outright saying that we support something.\n\nI'll admit that sometimes I am prone to rightist errors, and to sometimes being too eager to support everything that is against Europe/US. I just feel like I don't want to be the reason that the US/Israel/Europe are not defeated, if this makes any sense. I don't want to support UNITA against the revisionism of the MPLA.\n\nPS: Sorry if this doesn't make much sense, It's almost midnight and I am tired.\n\n*By itself, this decline in voting and members wouldn't be worrying if it was caused by a restructuration of the party towards a revolutionary line. Like I said after, this is not the case.",

It is having difficulties in continuing their revisionist politics at the same scale. Therefore the focus on \"refor\u00e7ar o Partido\" and the invite to the \"renovadores\". However, their decay is not due to the appearance of any \"leftist\" line or organization that is gathering support. On the contrary, the PCP, in order to appeal to a broader base, finds itself compelled to shift further to the right because every single large political force is shifting to the right as an expression of the interests of the corresponding classes when faced with the current situation. It's just that with this kind of politics the party is superfluous when you have PS or even Chega.\n\nThe PCP is declining not because of their rightism, in essence the same old social-democratic (social-fascist) politics, but because of their specific form of rightism, a kind of eurocommunist ideology and practice, that no longer finds support in any class (because the entry to the EU, in restructuring the classes, has largely eliminated the need and possibility for such type of revisionist politics). The same rightism, in different forms, is prevalent in basically all organizations, associations, unions, collectives, etc., apart from tiny circles.\nWhile that leftcom organization appears the most active group in criticizing PCP, that is only because of the practically non-existent activity of maoist organizations in Portugal. That leftcom organization is very, very far from forming a party. They're very small and are not really ideologically consolidated.

It is not clear how long the hegemony the PCP still has will last and even if it disappeared right now, without a revolutionary alternative other forms of rightism would take its place in an instant.",

                    "body": "I thought this was a decent article\n\nhttps://positionspolitics.org/hyun-ok-park-on-politics-after-12-3-insurrection-in-south-korea/\n\nThe key part for me\n\n>Candlelight protests have evolved into a distinctive form of mass politics since their emergence in 2002, rejecting both the class struggle paradigm of the 1980s democracy movement and the social and civil society movements that followed democratization in the 1990s. The candlelight protests embody a neo-anarchist ethos akin to movements like Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring. They emphasize decentralized organization, eschew established institutional frameworks and hierarchical leadership, and advocate for horizontal relationships and grassroots initiatives\u2014often facilitated by social media platforms. This modality of politics underscores both the potential and the fragility of mass mobilizations in navigating the crises of liberal democracy, raising critical questions about their future trajectory and alignment. During the 2016-2017 impeachment protest, protesters of all ages, from teenagers to middle-aged adults, vocally rejected attempts by politicians and activists to lead the demonstrations, even though major organizations like the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) provided key logistical support, including stages, giant monitors, high-powered speakers, and electric cables. Instead, the protesters emphasized spontaneity and festive communal activities. They shared food and casual conversations on the streets, fostering a sense of solidarity. They crafted their own banners, blurring the lines between politics and everyday life. In continuity, the protests to impeach Yoon have shown banners, \u201cThe National Coalition to Stay Lying Down at Home,\u201d \u201cThe Group That Doesn\u2019t Want to Do Anything,\u201d and \u201cThe Research Group on the Smell of Dog\u2019s Paws.\u201d Parodies of established organizations also emerged, like \u201cMinju Myoch\u2019ong\u201d (Those Who Want to Democratize Cats) and \u201cMandu Noch\u2019ong and Saewu Noch\u2019ong\u201d (Dumpling and Shrimp Associations), mocking the KCTU (Minju Noch\u2019ong). After a week after the botched insurrection, previous signs of organized protest logistics are notably absent. The festive and communal energy is even more palpable. K-pop songs and cheerleading light balls used in pop idol concerts fill the streets. Social media platforms are buzzing with celebratory photos and practical advice and tips for participants, such as turtleneck sweaters over scarves, bread over cookies as snacks, and tying back long hair so as not to bother others on windy days. Heartwarming stories have emerged of older generations and the MZ generation bridging their differences by singing together and cheering as KCTU members pushed back police lines and garnered extra space for protesters.\n\nSo that's the contradiction I've talked with u/AltruisticTreat8675. On the one hand South Korean politics are this kind of festive, post-ironic thing you see in the parasitic first world. On the other hand what they're protesting is a real military coup (which seems to have failed mostly because of Yoon's incompetence, as the article points out it was deeply entrenched in so-called democratic institutions)\n\n>In detail, in a mere span of one week, the investigation unearthed startling revelations so far: the coup to secure power indefinitely had been planned step-by-step since early 2024, and its failure stemmed from a fractured military command. In the months preceding the insurrection, Yoon had strategically appointed his high school alumni to key strategic posts, including the defense minister and chiefs of crucial military divisions. Under their command, the military began recruiting soldiers into special units, ostensibly to prepare for potential terrorist threats from North Korea following a series of drone provocations. These special forces underwent months of training and were placed on high alert on the day martial law was declared. Immediately following the declaration, the special teams were deployed to two key locations: the National Election Commission, under the guise of securing evidence of alleged irregularities in the June 2024 general election in which the minority Democratic Party had won a landslide victory; and the National Assembly, to prevent legislators from convening and voting to repeal martial law. Simultaneously, others were tasked with arresting opposition leaders with plans to detain them in a secret bunker. Further investigations filled in the gaps. The troops were instructed to seize the main server of the National Election Commission to plant fabricated evidence of fraud in the June election and then call for a new election with a pre-determined outcome. The detention of a prominent journalist and a political strategist, both aligned with the Democratic Party, was intended to coerce them into legitimizing the fabricated election results. Plans for Day 2 of the martial law also included deploying additional special forces throughout Seoul, suggesting an escalation of authoritarian control. A special force was prepared to provoke skirmishes with North Korea or cause violence in the society by posing as North Korean agents. These revelations have not only intensified public outrage but also highlighted the calculated planning and perilous ambitions underlying the failed coup. This effort likely began at the beginning of Yoon\u2019s presidency when he relocated the presidential office to the Ministry of National Defense.\n\nAt this level of planning knowledge in the military and the ruling party was widespread, closer to the coups and self--coups of the third would.\n\nAnyway this is unfortunately why I take the internet and \"content\" very seriously. For many of us, this will be the future of politics. The internet may pretend that behind the irony-pilled posting is motivation to \"do something\" but it's the opposite. Doing something is increasingly subordinated to internet modes of identity. This isn't exactly news but, as you can see, in the years since 2016 it's become much worse.",

Dengism and associated \"breadtube\" type content is just opportunism, using new media technologies for the same consensus on the terms of hegemonic liberalism over revolutionary Marxism.\n\nIn my mind, there is only one rule in this subreddit and one purpose: make good posts rather than bad ones. Good posts contain an element of objective truth while bad ones do not. There are many forms of bad posts, as you imply some of them have the facade of \"serious\" research, some of them are ironic fascist images, some of them are \"meta\" posts about whether it is even possible to make good posts. I assure you it is possible and no one on YouTube or any other subreddit has ever made a good post.\n\nThis also means it is not possible to determine a-priori whether your posts are good. You can only make them with concern for objective truth and hope for the best. If you are posting for any other reason you are indeed wasting your time.\n\n>At least in a video game or TV fandom, there is at least some honesty that it is purely for enjoyment and leisure.\n\nThe proletarian revolution will happen with or without you.

Understanding reality in order to change it is fun. Meeting other communists is fun as is seeing a relationship between theory and practice play out, positively or negatively. And, it should be said, fandom is not fun either. It is miserable because sustaining the contradiction between fantasy and reality without the ability to solve it is miserable.

I'm guessing it's the sort of thing where if you'd be playing, for example, Settlers of Catan, you'd be enjoying recreating the social relations of colonialism, right? But for some other games and forms of escapism, they'd have different relations that might be more obscured (I am not sure what Minecraft in creative mode, a game like Thief II, or even a competitive game like chess would be fetishizing).",

These games are not metaphors for something outside of them and you don't have to read the narrative as representing some unconscious class interest. \n\nThey are exactly what they seem like: forms of unalienated labor. The study of this aspect of games is called ludology (if you want somewhere to start though the field is primitive).\n\nThere are narrative aspects of games which mimic colonialism (the study of these is called narratology although the separation of game studies into these two fields is ultimately unsustainable and should be thought of as a heuristic tool) but this is secondary to the narrative aspect of playing the game itself.\n\nThe main issue is that unalienated labor is a fantasy. This is not only because of games as commodities produced somewhere (pointing out this simple fact causes a hysterical reaction) but games becoming increasingly social and communal (a game you play on your own with a beginning and an end is just an interactive movie or a choose your own adventure book, these are not new forms - this is my primary problem with something like *Disco Elysium* which uses gameplay mechanics to disguise an extremely long choose your own adventure novel. There is a reason the genre is associated with children, it's very hard to tell an interesting story when you have to tell multiple stories at the same time that converge into the same vague endpoint. Moby Dick probably wouldn't be very good if halfway through you could choose to retire and forget about the whale). Resistance to the intrusion of the other into the fantasy of unalienated labor is the reason \"gamers\" exist whereas literature and movies get \"cinemaphiles\" or \"book nerds,\" basically retroactive, failed attempts to apply the social relations of games to older media forms. \n\nChess is an old game. Trying to divine meanings in the story it tells of war is not Marxism, it's a fetishism where the meaning of works is buried in some level of depth inaccessible to surface enjoyment. It is the opposite: surface enjoyment is where ideology lies, which is why chess has such a misogyny problem (because women are also capable of having fun, which, if you've read Freud, is the first danger of castration).",

Would it be fair to say that the ideology behind the surface enjoyment of chess, by and large, is revealed in an obsession with strategy and logic and problem-solving skills not towards any greater collaborative goal but in order to increase one's chess ranking? A sort of fetishization of intelligence and wisdom, set opposed to the scarily-political fields of warfare or \"geopolitics\"? And that the fact that in order to truly \"great\" at chess, you have to pour a lot of time and money into it from a very young age (much younger than, say, basketball), creates both a structure of elitism in titled chess and a comfortable explanation for one's own mediocrisy?\n\nWhat do you (or others, I don't know if you care much about chess) make of the recent situation where FIDE banned transgender women from participating in chess? There was an outcry among liberals about how obviously ridiculous that is given the fact that the beloved \"biological differences\" argument falls apart, but then for once in their lives, rabid transmisogyny overcoming latent misogyny, chessbros recognized the existence of structural misogyny in their favorite hobby and pushed back that \"male socialization\" would give someone a leg up due to (again) the necessity of getting an early start in study and competition play. Of course, this wasn't developed upon any further - in such a worldview, the only solution to this problem is to create a discrete \"female chess rating\" to offer a bandaid, rather than addressing the structural inequalities and elitism in the field. And of course, the existence of such a band-aid for (cisgender) women, but not for (to use crude terminology here) low-income people, Black people, people with  disabilities, etc., shows how little chess players actually care about overcoming these baked-in biases, as opposed to using postmodernist diversity/inclusion/justice language as a cover for transmisogyny.\n\nI don't have time to elaborate now but I think there's also quite a bit to be said about how chess has been turned into another \"fandom\", with subreddits like r/AnarchyChess(!), chess being one of the most viewed streaming categories on Twitch, etc. The majority of fans of chess aren't playing it for \"fun\" (this goes back to the discussion a little further up), but rather, consuming it as another commodity, and playing it to prove the so-called truthfulness of their \"chess fan\" commodity identity.\n\nAs I'm sure you can tell this is something I have a lot of thoughts about; what a good example of how talking about fandom-ideologies in vague and generalizing terms is less productive than taking specific examples.\n\nE: banned transgender women from participating in *women's* chess; I don't think we live in a world - yet - where a blanket ban on transgenderism could be instituted without pushback.\n\nEE: funnily enough, I was trying to find where Alireza Firouzja (relatively unknown outside the chess field) was hyping up Andrew Tate, and instead found a [youtube short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3wkQ6WKIRhI) where Hikaru Nakamura (the most famous chess player currently alive) explicitly referenced him when instructing his viewers to \"try harder\". Sometimes Marxist analysis of the modern world is difficult for me but I feel pretty confident in what I'm saying here.",

Specific fandoms are increasingly indistinguishable beyond their broad demographic features (K-pop fandom probably won't have many Andrew Tate fans but the mechanism of enjoying everything except the music is the same). Also in general the Internet is too widespread to sustain earlier \"militant atheist\" type elitism which was the last gasp of subculture against a supposed normative culture. The superiority remains but lacks any referent, instead one can simultaneously believe themselves to be superior to women because they play chess and follow a knuckle-dragging moron like Andrew Tate and other esoteric, pseudo-spiritual \"self-help\" scammers in the manosphere. \n\n>What do you (or others, I don't know if you care much about chess) make of the recent situation where FIDE banned transgender women from participating in chess?\n\nThis is sort of what I mean. The differences between communities melt away and everything becomes part of the same culture war soup. It was therefore inevitable that liberal identity politics would strike back and chess fandom would be \"called out.\" Of course this is better than the right-wing version because trans people actually exist and deserve the right to play chess professionally but the means by which it occurs is the same terrain of \"meta\" enjoyment of everything except chess and speaks the same language (in a sense right wing identify politics simply invert the language and methods of liberalism). Chess especially is ill-suited to these discussions because the pieces are not well endowed anime characters or racial stereotypes from the British Empire, a little girl and her father can play the game and have fun and it will probably be a shock that there's all this other stuff around it (unlike, say, magic the gathering which was born under corporate control and therefore all struggles take place within the terms of the corporate \"canon\").

Or GTA where being \"just a game\" allows consequence-free violence. But this is still a reading of the narrative. When I talk about unalienated labor, I mean something much more basic: you take certain game actions according to a set of rules and accomplish something as a result. That is, there is a direct relationship between your labor and your results. It's important to think about games this way because, as you point out, there are all kinds of ways of playing games: ways that break the programmed rules, ways that don't directly advance the plot, ways that are obsessive in a single task, etc. What matters is that each way of playing has its own set of causes and effects which are not mediated by abstract labor, or the fundamentally indirect relationship between your labor power on the market and your means of life. Of course every action has a causality, like picking up a fork and now having a fork in your hand. What distinguishes a game is the particular set of rules that determine the incentives that lead to causes and effects. If you want to perform critique of games, you have to determine what those rules leave out and how that fetishism is naturalized. \n\nThe basic fetishism of labor remuneration can easily become politicized: the [insert Other] has taken away your reward. This is, unfortunately compounded by the major tendency of games today: games without an end where the game-generated world is really a place for endless accumulation and anticipation of future commodities to accumulate. In this regard, capitalism is the ultimate game, with completely irrational rules. *Star Citizen* is this logic taken to its most extreme (the desiring is itself the goal) but it points to a general tendency in all games today since it allows for (seeming) endless profit extraction (what is actually happening is a form of extreme speculation on \"virality\"). \n\nGame rules are perfectly compatible with social games which can be even more fun. The \"social\" I am talking about has nothing to do with games at all, which are simply rulesets, but rather the ideological function of games as a place untouched by capitalism, where the intrusion of the Other is the cause of alienation - basically fascism (liberal identity politics function in the same way so it is up to you whether you want to think of it as a variant of fascism depending on the power you assign the word). The key point is that gamers hate games as do all fandoms hate the object of their obsession. Otherwise they would just enjoy what the thing has to offer and move on.\n\n>I'm especially curious on your thoughts about something like EVE Online or how people in South America would seriously grind gold in World of Warcraft and Runescape to make a living in real life.\n\nThat's not a game, that's just work. A job can be fun and it can even be \"game-ified\" (see for example the great Philip K. Dick-esque representation of labor in *Severance* which is composed of putting mysterious symbols into boxes) but work is constituted by a fundamentally different set of rules: the production of commodities through the exploitation of abstract labor. A game has its own internal system of logic according to its ruleset. \n\n>Is it because other people entering your fantasy disrupts it, because they inject their own consciousness into yours in a way? \n\nTo be clear what we're discussing is the result of capitalist alienation. Playing chess under socialism is simply fun. Playing games with other people under socialism is a regular human activity. Freud reduces what is particular to capitalism to human nature (the topic of another thread from yesterday) so when I use his terms I should probably specify that we are discussing ideology as it emerges from general commodity production. \n\n>It's hard for me to make these sorts of analyses like you do so fluidly and accurately though I am trying to improve my understanding. \n\nWell I have a lot of practice but, as I said before, that only allows me to have a kind of general knowledge. So even though I don't know that much about chess I can talk about it because I understand ideology-as-such. But anyone is capable of this analysis when it's a specific thing they care about. As I said, everyone cares about something. It's just rarely the thing itself. \n\n>Still, do you think there can be any games with good storytelling?\n\nI don't play enough games to really say, there are basically an infinite number these days and I'm sure some of them have real consequences in their rules which make achievements an actual accomplishment. People are so obsessed with speedrunning because the extreme level of devotion required to achieve the desired outcome is sort of like a glimpse into human potential outside of capitalism (imagine if someone devoted as much time and energy to reading the works of Marxism as they do a single level of a 30 year old N64 game and there were youtube channels with millions of views marveling at the mastery of weedlord69 of dialectical materialism). Most \"gamers\" unfortunately half-ass even their own identity and need something to blame. Like I said, chess fandom is the domain of shitty chess players, and the goal of capitalism is to make games that incentivize fandom with the minimal, least fun amount of gameplay possible. In my limited experience, the Metal Gear Solid games have fun moments, like when you are forced to wade through a river of people you murdered carelessly or when you are forced to change controllers to defeat Psycho Mantis. Unfortunately speedrunning is also a capitulation to a reality where games can never be fun, as any craft by the programmers or narrative context is eliminated for extreme tedium punctuated by pure stimulation.",

I think I'm starting to understand that the problem is that fandoms ruin games because they do everything but enjoy the game for what it is. I've experienced this a lot, for example, with Counter Strike, where nearly every single player only cares about winning to achieve a higher numerical rank to obtain this identity of a \"good player\", so much so that people deep in the fandom will pay for alternate matchmaking service (e.g. ESEA or Faceit) so they can have higher tick rate servers and fewer cheaters in their lobbies. The people playing it are often so miserable with the game itself that it's very common among these communities (Dota 2, League of Legends, Overwatch, CS:GO, etc.) to joke about how playing these games is a punishment, and if someone even tries to play the game just to have fun they completely freak out. I remember many years ago a player tried to innovate by playing a character in League of Legends, called Teemo, a traditionally solo-lane character, and he would match to get assigned as a support in the bottom-lane (which is already an off-meta role for this character), but he would even go so far as to completely disregard the established community meta of the game by roaming around in the map to help all of his other teammates and not staying in the bottom-lane, which is usually what you'd do for the first 10 minutes of the game. The result of this innovation, which he did trying to have fun and win at the same time, was that he got mass reported until he was banned off the game for a few months for \"trolling\", just because he didn't conform to the expected playstyle. If everything I just said sounded like gibberish to you, let me give you a similar hypothetical: imagine if you are playing playing football with your friends, and you have been playing as the goalie for the last couple weeks. One day, you decide to try a new strategy: instead of sitting back at the goal and waiting for the attackers to come to you, you run up the field and play as an aggressive defender to try to contribute towards the team's success, and at the sight of this, everyone starts to verbally abuse you and you end up getting physically thrown out the field and told to never come back.\n\nYour comment brought this back to my mind and now I see your point that nobody playing these games is actually having fun, so really that means very few people playing games are actually enjoying them and they're really just playing games to distract themselves and stave off anxiety. I think also these games interface a lot with the \"other\" as you said due to the social aspect of these competitive team games, where if someone loses they will immediately blame and abuse their teammates for \"making them lose ELO\" and \"ruining\" their experience, which is ironic because the joy of the game really should be in cooperation, shared victories and losses. Instead it's turned into a prison where you hate the jailer (the developer), you hate yourself, and you hate your cellmate.\n\nGiven all this, do you think it's possible to take these games and play them with the intent to enjoy them for what they are, without any irony or desire to find any hidden meaning, which as you said in another comment actually is another form of fetishism? I'm not sure if it's a stupid idea I'm thinking right now but before reading your comments I felt that playing games under capitalism was a waste of time, but now after reading your comments I feel optimistically driven to play some games and really meet them at their level, and I mean playing them purely for what they are and nothing more to try and see if I can enjoy them at their core. In such a way it's funny to say but Marxism could maybe make these video games, which people often don't have fun playing, actually fun for the first time ever, but maybe I am wrong about that and these games by their very flawed design and nature can't ever be fun.\n\nE: corrected that League of Legends example that I originally misremembered.",

That is, there is a direct relationship between your labor and your results.\n\n>The basic fetishism of labor remuneration can easily become politicized: the [insert Other] has taken away your reward.\n\nI think this explains the fascistic mindsets of league of legends players in the competitive ladder. They believe that they deserve a higher competitive rank and when this fantasy is disrupted they immediately project the source of their problems onto an other.\n\nThey blame their teammates for underperforming or being \"boosted\" (by a higher level player) to their rank: even though, in aggregate, this factor affects the enemy team equally, if not more so if you truly punch above your weight. Or they blame the enemy team for over performing: accusations of \"smurfing\" (the act of a higher ranked player playing on a significantly lower ranked account)--this might affect the game quality, but statistically evens out. \n\nThey blame the developers for balancing decisions that reward so-called \"degenerate\" playstyles or uninteractive gameplay; despite correct gameplay involves capitalizing on moments of strength (or punishing mistakes) to force favorable and consequently uninteractive encounters and the irony that they are still able to play the game despite not fighting with their counterpart, just not in the way they like. Sometimes they blame the corporation for using game balance to sell skins (purchasable virtual cosmetics), as a form of faux anti-capitalism. \n\nOther times, they blame the intrusion of real or imagined alienated labor: boosters on the enemy team or win-traders (players who intentionally throw games in exchange for money) on their own team causing them to lose. \n\nEqually common is blaming the match-making algorithm itself for putting them in \"loser's queue\": a conspiracy where the algorithm fixes the matches, \"artificially\" creating lose streaks and win streaks to drive player engagement. This one is the most egregious excuse. A simulation of 100 coin-flips will result in long streaks of heads or tails rather than an even alternating pattern that one might expect. All the algorithm does is put the player in a rank where they have a fair chance of winning or losing, where they have a 50% win:loss ratio.\n\nOf course, none of these factors prevent better players from climbing, to which they respond that they're too busy working to \"no-life\" a game and that those sweaty \"try-hards\" should touch grass, despite spending equally absurd amounts of time pushing the boulder up the hill and presumably trying just as hard.\n\n>What matters is that each way of playing has its own set of causes and effects which are not mediated by abstract labor, or the fundamentally indirect relationship between your labor power on the market and your means of life.\n\nWhich is impossible in a competitive game, where the stratification of players into ranks with tangibly different skill levels betrays the fundamental fantasy of unalienated labor. That some players can valorize their ability to play the game, whether for boosting services, content creation, or as professional eSports athletes implies that there is a relationship between abstract labor and the outcome of the game.\n\nThe game itself is not fun. I think the enjoyment is the simulation of accumulating capital, or simply \"getting good\". Becoming proficient with the game taking those skills to market  and (hopefully) winning against those who have not done their market research. What clicks of the mouse, taps of the keyboard, and in what order; what manoeuvres, tactics, and strategies create enough advantages to force a win? What characters do you invest in according to their win percentages according to rank? Or even the gameplay itself of accumulating gold through performing meaningful (within the rules of the game) actions, turning them into commodities of great power, and \"snowballing\" that advantage into even greater amounts of gold.\n\nu/princeloser",

If you see a pre-social media wholesomeness in competitive Tetris then it's there too in speedrunning circles. Competitive classic Tetris itself was even partially forced into the general rules of speedrunning between 2008-2012, until the 999,999 cap was modded out of the game. In addition to a resistance to corporate canon (however futile) I think the healthy competition thing is there in speedrunning, fighting games, etc.; you know it when you see it. The game definitely sets the limits; there's an obvious difference between Mario Kart time trials and Metal Gear Solid speedruns as far as a disrespect for the art of games goes. But still, you'll find a lively, collaborative-competitive development of technique in the tight group of Metal Gear Solid speedrunners, despite what Kojima would think about the whole thing. A better example that comes to mind is Super Smash Bros. Melee, whose competitive scene respects the true essence of the game to such a degree that it torments its creator. Melee isn't totally immune to valorization but it does stand, self-aware, in stark opposition to the competitive scene of its modern successor; the self-awareness even produces a charming politics.",

This is immanent to chess because it is a social experience and therefore situated in concrete social relations but it is clearly compatible with multiple modes of production and can be played in a variety of contexts. It's not like playing with your father is reenacting the Oedipus complex through little figures at war, that's a fundamental misunderstanding of Marxism. But as it becomes harder to resist the game around the game, posting on chess.com and Reddit, tying one's identity as an intelligent or rational person (usually as a man) to it, speculating about cheating at the top or international competition (moreso in the cold war era), it becomes harder to have a discussion about the game which becomes a refuge for reactionary identity politics. \"It's just a game.\" Then where did your love of Jordan Peterson come from?\n\nThe nice thing about chess is that, because it's so difficult, it actually resists this meta culture around it. The large majority of \"rational\" debatebros who use chess as their sense of identity are actually terrible at it and would be crushed by any semi-professional woman. In my experience, real professionals understand their knowledge of chess is extremely specialized and does not make them experts in social policy or superior to the thinking of \"normies.\" It also resists commodified self-expression: though I'm sure they're are people to use star wars chess sets or make their own custom fandom pieces, the game itself is not composed of collectibles and there is an upper limit to how much profit can be squeezed out of the mechanics. This only means that the game itself is becoming peripheral to the identity around it (this is what I meant before about having fun: chess is fun. Posting about it on Reddit is not fun because it is not playing chess and most of the people posting about chess probably hate it because fandom cannot save you from winning or losing as an individual based on your own ability). The solution is to play the game. Imagine if a woman played Jordan Peterson in chess. Even if she lost, the amount of innate human intelligence on display (mostly in silence) that goes into strategic thinking and competition would deflate his entire persona. Such an event can never be allowed.\n\nE: I've never played Minecraft but I'm sure it's also fun. Capitalism cannot create fun, it can only parasitically attach itself to fun things. Minecraft is unfortunately much more susceptible to commodification and fandom (what has also been called \"nerddom\", defined as ideological immersion into a libertarian fantasy) but even then, anyone can play the game and have fun.",

Of course, \"progressive\" chess clubs are an echo chamber, and on every video interview of the supposed cheater, thousands of people in the comments are saying the most 1990s-coded homophobic things about how he walks like someone who's used anal beads, how his brightly-colored shirts and weird accent \"support the allegations\", etc.\n\n(I see as I'm typing this how ridiculous this sounds to anyone in slightly different online and offline circles as I am; I'm hoping that this is forgivable since it's buried deep in the discussion thread.)",

People think Marxism is miserable because they have to deconstruct hidden meanings in the things they enjoy and punish themselves for being part of an exclusive club (and chess is exclusive as you point out). But it's the opposite: chess is fun and Marxism liberates it from all the fetters of capitalism. Anyone can play chess and everyone can enjoy it under socialism. This is the point that Deleuze and Guattari are trying to make (although they conflate Freud and Freudianism as practiced to make it) and that's where I got the idea of capitalism as a parasite on desire from (since that reference is too obscure otherwise). The search for hidden meanings is actually part of fandom since it protects the act of enjoyment from critique. Posting on Reddit about how you can't imagine socialism without *Call of Duty* is what's miserable (and again, I'm not even saying you can't play games under socialism - rather the provocation is revealing of what's actually being enjoyed and the more fundamental opportunism of presenting socialism as American commodity society but for you).\n\nHow this ties into politics, other than the obvious relation between self-flagellation and Sanders third-worldism (everyone is too highly online including me, everything must be couched in irony including what I say, only reformist compromise is possible and therefore I am given permission to do so by the big Other, etc ), needs more exploration since, as I've mentioned before, these new mediatized relations to commodities are global, albeit mediated by nationalism (the new Indian chess champion is *Indian* - the best starting point is Jameson's controversial essay on third world literature).\n\nI played chess as a kid but I haven't played for a long time and I know very little about the fandom around it.

Other than a basic defense of the terms of socialist realism within a general historical pattern of cultural \"movements\" where manifestos and collectives were the norm (and the larger project of nation building), I understand that trying to appreciate socialist era music today will only lead to a different form of fandom. No one is really going to sit down and listen to Red Sun in the Sky after Sabrina Carpenter (or Tool or RATM) with the same aesthetic standard. The question also suffers the problem of a lack of a clear distinction between socialist and revisionist periods in art and culture, since culture is semi-autonomous and does not automatically follow the direction of the class struggle.\n\nStill, if forced to, chess would be a good place to start because of its great importance in Soviet life. An exploration of the social world around chess would be interesting to socialists, far more interesting than another discussion of portraiture by people who don't even care about painting.\n\nI've thought about it with Tetris actually because the community around the game is one of the most wholesome and resembles pre-social media subculture and I do wonder if that's because the game resists commodification in a way that actually makes it more open to exploration and healthy competition.

If you went to live in the woods for a few months with nothing but North Korean music you would probably grow to enjoy it. As we were discussing, the problem is precisely the lack of commitment and the use of irony to protect oneself from having fun. Not only does this lead to general confusion between the thing-itself and the fandom around the thing it polices what is acceptable within the limits of irony and what is \"cringe\" outside of it. I normally wouldn't think about this at all since at least ironic appreciation of communism might eventually lead to real appreciation through the kind of exposure therapy I mentioned above but a recent clip of Hasan listening to North Korean music and calling it \"k-pop\" actually offended me. Within the world of acceptable irony, Koreans are obviously not allowed, which is why there is hostility to anything approaching an unironic proletarian art.\n\ne: If you're curious\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1gsxm6u/hasan_plays_his_favourite_north_korean_propaganda/\n\nThe clip itself is \"cringe\" in a way that hurts me but I don't really care about these people, they are just vessels for capital accumulation.

It is in a sense just the packing problem, and the satisfaction I find in completing a set is similar to the feeling of solving a math equation.\n\nWhat I am unsure about is the link between tetris and the eventual derivatives of puzzle games which bring us to things like candy crush and other tile matching games. With candy crush being highly addicting but also designed to make as much profit as possible.\n\nIt is also maybe what is happening with tetris, with all the different versions of the game that now exist that incorporate features from other games 'battle royale, competitive-online mode, etc'.\n\nI find the discussion of the social nature of games interesting though. For instance how in the Philippines games such as singing 'bahay kubo', 'leron-leron sinta' while people clap hands\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_games_in_the_Philippines\n\nor Bato Bato Pik/Jak-en-poy/rock-paper-scissors which also has a social aspect.\n\nMost of these games being things that I remembered doing growing up as a kid, with only the most sheltered Filipinos not experiencing at least one of these things. \n\nWhat's funny is these games are still fun, and are probably much more fulfilling than mindlessly doing gaccha all day.

Now the gameplay loop has shattered, since the reward of a solved puzzle/contradiction is not contingent on one\u2019s labor but on if you want to spend $2 or not to do so (or rather labor becomes abstracted again). Since this outcome is fundamentally unfulfilling (like googling the answer to a math problem in your analogy), it becomes addictive and thus incentivizes greater participation in the market so that ones cosplay of being a puzzle-solver is rewarded. The real reward is the accumulation of \u201clevels\u201d that allow you to differentiate yourself from others. \n\nI love that you brought up traditional games like bahay kubo into this discussion because despite video games specifically being a more modern phenomenon, games are the oldest art form and have a long history of use everywhere on earth.

I can now see it as being fundamentally recreating colonialism in a game, though often there are no real civilizations there aside from the few randomly generated villages and in some versions of the game there is really nothing out there but wilderness, but yea, I think it's fairly clear if I didn't misunderstand. The difficulty with analyzing Minecraft creative mode for me is because of the Redstone and the new programming systems, it effectively turns into a game creator in of itself, so you can make even chess in Minecraft, but I'd guess that less than 1% of people who play Minecraft end up using it that way, so it's not really worth considering.

Marxism is very specifically not vulgar American anti-intellectualism which is otherwise hegemonic on the \"left.\" Marx and Engels were simultaneously criminals on the run and great philosophers and scholars of literature. Mao was both a guerilla fighter and a poet. Instead of this petty-bourgeois self hatred which is in fact completely natural to the ideological functioning of the petty-bourgeoisie, just make good posts.

The method here is different than responding to During or Mach or Khrushchev but only in form.\n\n>the knowledge requried in a political organization wouldn't necessarily overlap\n\nThere is no knowledge required for a political organization. Only political line matters, anyone can learn to make a sign or sell a newspaper or make a speech or hold a gun. These skills do not need discussion.\n\nI feel like you keep looking for that a-priori guarantee that what you're doing is meaningful. That's impossible. It is only when the mind touches objective reality that its work becomes retroactively meaningful. If you are not doing that it is an error of the mind, the medium is irrelevant. This is just human consciousnesses communicating through text on a screen. That's all the Internet has ever been. The illusion of social media is to make you think it's something else, that the form of technology somehow makes society something new or different. That's just ideological fetishism, every medium is supposed to be the harbinger of a new society in which something other than class is what determines human relations. That's just fetishism.",

The question of how communists should think about health care in the US can't be reduced to any social gain being merely a redistribution of imperialist superexploitation. Firstly, because liberals correctly point out that private healthcare is inefficient even by its own standards if the goal is healthcare. Second because it affects everyone, and the \"universal\" aspect of healthcare for the poor is still extremely bad because of the larger system it is a part of. Thirdly, the question of reformist demands will not go away because of imperialism, you still live and do politics in the imperialist core and have to take some kind of position. Fourthly, because the relationship between settler-colonialism and imperialism is not at all obvious and conflating them merely turns \"settlers\" into either a generic term for \"everyone but me,\" synonymous with \"programmed sheeple\" or a specific term for \"deplorables\" by those too ashamed to directly quote Hillary Clinton. Otherwise you run into the basic logical problem of your own critique negating itself.\n\nYou'll have to do more to justify your application of the term to this situation beyond the stereotype that armed white American men must be \"settlers.\" Suburban moms are just as much settlers.

If what I believe Luigi wants is met (generally improved coverage), wouldn't a large portion still be exempt?\n\nLiberals may pretend they are against \"corporations\" and \"greed\" but the point of these concepts (and the particular focus on this health care company as excessively greedy and this CEO being sued for fraud) is that the capitalist system itself is inefficient at achieving optimal market outcomes, hence regulation is better not only for people but corporations. That is why the focus in the manifesto is on the divergence between spending and health outcomes, since even CEOs are people too (the assassin comes from a wealthy family). That is why arguments about the spoils of imperialism are not relevant to the question of universal healthcare since, at least to liberals, it is a matter of more efficient redistribution, not taking more. In fact, universal healthcare will supposedly cost less for the system as a whole (what this argument misses among other things is that the US is not just a country but an imperialist hegemon, and much of its healthcare spending is done to maintain intellectual property in medicine and health science).\n\nThis is basically what you argue here\n\n>It appears to me that there is a benefit of a decent healthcare system not only to the U.S. population but to U.S. industry as well; obviously you want your workforce healthy enough to return to work. However, the only way this is possible is due imperialism, is it not? \n\nWhich you run away from into \"imperialism\" as an excuse for why reformism is not possible. Reformism must be rejected on its own terms (or accepted, the point is the attitude of US communists towards this issue must be confronted head on). It would probably be better if you just forgot the question of imperialism because Marx and Engels already established the fundamental communist positions on reforms before Lenin's intervention.\n\n>Why should my needs or any other settler in the U.S. be of any importance\n\nBecause that's not what communist politics is. I recently discussed the history of the \"minimum-maximum\" program a bit and, while in that thread I pointed out that the question of imperialism had made it somewhat irrelevant, you still have to go through that history logically instead of skipping over it. It is not sufficient to say \"I reject all minimalist demands because they just strengthen imperialism.\" Ok, what are you going to do? Are you going to only have maximal demands? How do you connect those to the superexploited subjects of the third world you claim to speak for? Are you going to have some concept of a transitional program, where you only advocate for demands that sound reformist but are actually not? Historically, determining those demands has been impossible and liberals will just as easily argue that the efforts to squash Sanders' campaign proves universal healthcare is a transitional demand, verified by this episode of \"revolutionary violence.\"\n\nMy point is not that you're wrong but that it's not that interesting. It's an escape and, as I've pointed out before, crude Dengism is just as likely a result of \"third worldism\" as revolutionary Marxism. What does this specific event tell us about the political situation? I already know the US is a parasitic Empire.\n\nE: for example, since Lenin communists have dismissed individual terrorism and insurrectionary agitation as an infantile stage and counterproductive to the organized movement (though Lenin was nevertheless sympathetic and not at all afraid that actions by the masses could be \"counterproductive\", any failure of communists is internal to the communist movement). Marx and Engels were more ambiguous, Engels dying fighting against the Prussian military under the leadership of August Willich would have been a very foolish way to lose his great mind (though Engels infamously said the age of street battles and barricades was over and the age of mass democratic organization had begun). And while Marx was very critical of the Blanquists, it's indisputable that they played a major role in the Paris commune and the first form of the dictatorship of the proletariat whereas Marx was a commentator after the fact. Though a more useful comparison might be the dispute between Marx/Engels and Bakunin since they were much less sympathetic to the 1870 Lyons and 1874 Bologna insurrections (or rather, the attempt by Bakunin to insert himself in their leadership).\n\nMany people have observed that our current situation shares more in common with the situation of the world pre-WWI than the inter-war period or even the Cold War. Does that mean there will be a return to propaganda of the deed and insurrectionary politics? Is there room for the agitational aspects of spectacular violence given the long history of Eurocommunism being stuck in legality and parliamentary lesser evilism? That is part of the reason people want to discuss this here and why I was disappointed at the shooter's ideology and how it has been absorbed and neutered. Also revolutionary communists are sympathetic to so-called urban guerilla movements of the 1970s. It is unfortunately telling that Dengists, who otherwise despise the RAF or Red Brigades for standing against revisionism, are in love with this white settler gunman.",

There is an overall lack of serious, in-depth study of everything. I'm more inclined to view the knowledge production through threads and comments as inevitable outcomes of the widespread production of commodities made available through the internet that, in good post-modern fashion, compel us to write and reply as quickly as possible in order to satisfy a need through an use value, mirroring an IRL world where our needs can be promptly satisfied. The form and the content will be at odds with each other, and as of now, it seems the form is shaping the content (this is not restricted to this sub by the way, but it is a general trend of internet production as a whole). The question then becomes how to rise above this level, and I don't have any answers for that except that we, I mean this new generation of Communists, has yet to find out how to properly study and produce its own knowledge in written form. The largest proof that it can't is how many people deliberately try to immitate Lenin or Mao's style, but without any of the substance, it ends up sounding ridiculous. Writing is necessary for the clarification of ideas, but it is really hard and frustrating, because we are constantly shackled by our own lack of mastery of language to express what we have as intuitive and scientific understanding, and is becoming increasingly harder as bourgeois education more and more destimulates students to venture as independent essayists.\n\nEdit: since you mentioned it, I hope you are better from your injury.",

Rather, both of these have been subject to as much fetishism. I can only really speak for Amerika here so if the experience is different elsewhere please let me know.\n\nBooks basically don\u2019t exist anymore\u2014 the medium hollowed out by internet archives (though this isn\u2019t a complete transition and there\u2019s a real push to bring down online sources of information like the IA or Libgen, not to mention actual communist party websites). Nobody actually has to buy *State and Revolution* or *Capital* to read it, but people still do. Optimistically, it\u2019s because people understand that publishing houses are often still the primary site of translation/preservation and want to fund them when they can, but probably more often it is because the presence of the book becomes itself a symbol of legitimacy.* Even to this day, anticommunism is often laundered through useless and trite \u201cbooks\u201d that are more or less just \u201ctakes\u201d that ramble on for enough pages to look impressive on a bookshelf. This is as true for Dikotter as it is for Parenti. In my experience getting people to read a longer work isn\u2019t so much an issue of patience as it is a worry that they\u2019re wasting time\u2014 something totally understandable given that\u2019s true for most written works that aren\u2019t communist. \n\nSimilarly, the \u201cparty newspaper\u201d began as an attempt to modernize the weapons of ideological struggle by bringing the party into a format that could quickly respond to criticisms or attacks while being able to cheaply disseminate these ideas to the masses who would be deprived geographically or economically by other formats. But in today\u2019s day and age is this still the best form for these goals? I\u2019m interested in how the CPP uses Facebook, for example, but the corollary is that suppression via a private website is significantly easier than a physical piece of pressed pulp and ink, which is simple to smuggle or dispose of.\n\nI completely agree that this doesn\u2019t mean chasing some new trend is the answer. Your analysis of \u201ctakes\u201d and their role/reflection in the neoliberal economy is an insightful one that I\u2019ll have to consider more deeply. It\u2019s hard (but not impossible) for me to accept that these century-old forms are the best ways for communists to do knowledge production, but as you correctly note chasing any new form that arises without substantial critique is just opportunism. \n\nIn terms of both short-form and long-form, I think something like the MIM is an interesting attempt to wrestle with this (in something like *Imperialism Overthrown* but also Shubel Morgan), but I couldn\u2019t tell you if this is replicable or not. To your point, there is still a need for long, patient forms of knowledge production that escape this reflex for immediate response, which you critiqued quite well as a petty bourgeois impulse communists, and I especially, should be cognizant of, especially in the realm of internet production.\n\n*Of course in many places these sites are being actively monitored and censored so physical works become more necessary. This shouldn\u2019t be discarded in analyzing this situation globally, I think.\n\nEdit: and thank you. It isn\u2019t anything permanent fortunately.",

While proponents argue that naturism promotes body acceptance and a desexualized relationship with nudity, it's difficult not to see this through the lens of capitalist and patriarchal fetishization.\n\n\nOne question I've had is what defines \"Children\" vs \"Adult\"? There's this Qualitative difference that people have posited/inherited from past generations that After a Certain Number of years Since one escaped from a Womb they lose some sort of \"Childish innocence\" and attain \"Adulthood\" and both Bourgeois Law and Morals have attached this to Gender and Consent(to engage in Sexual Practices as well as Bourgeois Parliament/Electoralism) which is different between Nation-States(US 18, European countries range from 14-18, China 14, etc).\n\n\nBut I ask how do we understand the difference between \"Adult\" and \"Child\"? Is it simply \"Mental Capacity\"(however one defines it) as a difference can be Certainly seen between someone who is 8 years old and someone who is 16yrs old but what about the difference between 16yr old and 21 or 25yrs? Is it just that they person who's 25 has had more practice?\n\n\nI don't mean to say I agree with Reactionaries saying \"Age is just a Number\"(fuck them) but that the discussion around \"Children\" and Rape is heavily Moralist and I haven't found a solution to defining \"Children\" that isn't Moralist and relying on Bourgeois Law.",

Children, at one and the same time, become a commodity in production (in that their labor and existence as a worker is the commodity actively being produced) but are also reliant entirely on the patriarchal family for their means of survival. They have no way out of their oppression besides through the abolition of patriarchy and the family (or becoming a legal adult, but many legal adults can't even support themselves for one reason or another).\n\nOne of the interesting observations made in the article is in how the abolition of child labor and the removal of children from production entirely, devalues them in a similar way to how wimmin are devalued based on their removal from productive labor. They have no means of obtaining and utilizing capital of their own, and so are always in a state of submission. Culturally, this manifests in the most vile forms of eroticization as powerlessness is made out to be a pornographic \"virtue\" under class society in general and capitalist-imperialism in particular.\n\nThis all ties back into the recent discussions on these subreddits on the topic of [mental illness](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/1ha9q3e/mental_illness_schizophrenia_autism_bpd_etc_as/) and the semi-related discussion on the [last](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1gydnyt/comment/m0omm3k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) discussion thread, as children, based on these different material and cultural relations to patriarchy and nation, are likely to develop various mental illnesses as a result. The combination of their inability to survive on their own, their removal from production, and helplessness in the face of abuse can create immensely self destructive tendencies. This also presents a contradiction. They are labor in its production process, meant to reproduce capital, but are at the same time highly susceptible to \"undesirable\" social characteristics to capitalist production itself.",

I wonder if there's any relation to alienation in the production process between the teacher and the student (their \"product\"), and that cases of S.A. or harassment are a reaction to this alienation. Of course, there's also the factor of gender (of which children are gendered as wimmin, according to MIM) that likely plays the primary role over alienated production.",

            "body": "I was encouraged to see upvotes on my [last post](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1gnnnjo/biweekly_discussion_thread_november_10/lwvyte7/) on Covid, but disappointed to not see any replies. I took that to mean that I need to elaborate my ideas further, especially if the topic is as urgent as I believe it to be, but found myself without a good thesis statement and thus prone to unfocused thought-dumping. So instead I will try to focus on smaller pieces that will hopefully build towards the eventual goal of determining what communists should be doing about Covid. Guidance on what questions need to be answered next are appreciated, as are, of course, corrections to my extremely limited perspective as an Amerikan petit bourgeois.\n\nThe debate over what should be done about Covid on an individual-to-organizational level has *taken the* ***form*** *of* a petit-bourgeois struggle, in geographical terms largely coterminous with the Western- and US-centric culture wars, but with lines being drawn rather differently from it. Very strong parallels can, in my opinion, be made with the LGBT struggle. The strongest and most visible advocates for continued Covid action are petit-bourgeois for structural reasons - the petite bourgeoisie are more likely\n\n1. to have some level of education in science (together with a particular ideological disposition towards it and towards medicine),\n2. to have labor and social conditions amenable to continued mitigation (office work, remote work, petit-bourgeois social life),\n3. to have the income/capital necessary to fund mitigations (ranging from masks and tests, to better-quality healthcare, to air filtration and other technology, to apartments without roommates, detached houses, and private transportation), and\n4. to voice themselves, socialize, and organize on social media and in online spaces.\n\nEven disadvantaged people, particularly disabled and medically vulnerable people, who may even fall into the lumpenproletariat, must possess some of these petit-bourgeois characteristics in order to participate in this advocacy. These petit-bourgeois properties can also account for some of the worst qualities and behaviors that we have seen some of these Covid advocates demonstrate.\n\nMeanwhile, those advocating for inaction/reaction are **also** petit-bourgeois - whether they position themselves as open culture-war reactionaries or as urbane middle-class \"progressives\", they advocate for returning to pre-pandemic patterns of consumption and social life (i.e. free flow of capital and unrestrained exploitation) as quickly as possible, unfettered by the collective or personal costs of mitigation, and ideologically undisturbed by any suggestion, even from the sight of strangers wearing masks, that mitigation is necessary or morally correct. Seeking to protect their petit-bourgeois interests and lifestyles, they act as the front-line enforcers of the hegemony of bourgeois ideology around Covid, just as they do for other topics. (The bourgeoisie only differs in that some of them do genuinely understand that Covid remains harmful, but that they cannot and will not take any action that threatens the flow of capital. This petit-bourgeois/bourgeois dynamic can be compared with the one around climate change.)\n\nUnder these conditions, the proletarian position is difficult to establish independently or even find any expression at all. Without the petit-bourgeois conditions necessary for Covid advocacy listed above, a proletarian who becomes disabled by long Covid may simply remain silent as they fall into the lumpenproletariat or die. Although the proletariat also suffers these same outcomes due to other diseases, hunger, war, genocide, etc., the silence is specifically enforced in this case by the extent to which bourgeois ideology around Covid is hegemonic.\n\nMy hypothesis is that this petit-bourgeois form that the debate has assumed is what has allowed communists to ignore or dismiss it. However, a petit-bourgeois **form** does not mean it is devoid of proletarian **content** or significance, and communists must certainly not respond by submitting to bourgeois hegemony. Communists understand the organizational, not to mention ideological and moral, importance of welcoming LGBT people - it is unacceptable to use the fear of \"alienating the working class\" to excuse abandoning LGBT people, even if the LGBT struggle has largely or most visibly assumed a petit-bourgeois form. Communists take a position on climate change even if it is a problem that is \"far away\" from our hands, but even if societal solutions to Covid or LGBT issues are far away, the relevance that these issues have to organizational work is not. A position must be taken one way or another, and that position must be developed on a Marxist basis, not uncritically inherited from our bourgeois or petit-bourgeois ideological environments.",

I don't know the specifics of this debate but if an org is working backwards, they are wrong. but knowing the state of the communist movement within amerikkka, I struggle to imagine an org that could competently identify petty-boug politics because that is a matter where the call is coming from inside the house. I suspect the more likely explanation is that they just don't give a shit. \n\n>Communists understand the organizational, not to mention ideological and moral, importance of welcoming LGBT people - it is unacceptable to use the fear of \"alienating the working class\" to excuse abandoning LGBT people, even if the LGBT struggle has largely or most visibly assumed a petit-bourgeois form.\n\nthis wasn't always the case as LGBT inclusion isn't immediately obvious through Marxism. I have maintained that the widespread nominal \"LGBT inclusion\" in communist orgs within amerikkka is the result of necessity rather than scientific rigor. they care about quantity above all else and maintaining a (blatantly) heterosexist or cissexist line is counter to this within the current moment. it was easy for rcp-u$a to go \"uhhh... actually nvm\" on their decades-long commitment to heterosexism the moment it became inconvenient. this isn't to bash the modern-day rcp-u$a as an especially bad org for queer people due to their history like some liberals do. I think they are just another org that has an untrustworthy and shallow commitment to queer politics (often obscuring how queer people are actually treated within these places). the only exception I know of is acp which is able to be transmisogynistic because they advertise to a different demographic for the same revisionist goals. to get back to the subject, I just don't think disabled people have become indisposable to radical politics yet. plus, making yourself accountable to accesibility demands is harder and more of a commitment versus just slapping \"we don't support the discrimination of LGBT people\" on the \"party\" program.",

Identifying the factions of the debate (that is, the general societal debate, not just at the level of leftist orgs) as petit-bourgeois is my own contribution which I thought was necessary for understanding the problem - it's not something that I had heard others say. I guess I hoped that the instinct to question the class origins of all common sense, ruthlessly critique all that exists, etc. was more widespread, and that this is something I could appeal to people to do.\n\nI do wish I had more (any) insight into non-Amerikan, non-first world, proletarian perspectives here. But I can imagine that, outside the Western culture war context, and lacking petit-bourgeois representatives of either side, the result is that, rather than dismissing it, it's just not thought of at all. I'm not going to fault, like, the PFLP for not thinking about it when the Palestinian people are facing death in a million other ways. But I had heard about a little girl in Gaza who gave people masks amidst the genocide until she was killed by Zionist bombs earlier this year. (Gazans have other viruses and carcinogenic rubble dust to worry about, too.) Not everyone shares the indifference or scorn of Amerikans. I wish they could find a proletarian voice.\n\nI think you are right about LGBT inclusion too. Does this mean we will just have to wait however many years for long Covid to become as unignorable as AIDS was before anything will change?

Even in those certain urban areas where there are more people who take precautions, they are still a minority. I could talk more about this demographic aspect, but I will just point out two things. One, a minority being very small does not mean that their issues are unimportant or irrelevant to others - compare with trans people who have been said to make up 0.1% of the population. Two, it is possible for people to remain [concerned](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/03/07/how-americans-view-the-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccines-amid-declining-levels-of-concern/) even if they do not visibly display or act on it, particularly when faced with overwhelming social and ideological pressure to conform.\n\n[Here](https://youhavetoliveyour.life/) is a resource that you may find useful for understanding the perspective. It links to many different types of things (including mainstream news and liberal opinion pieces), so make what you will of it, and feel free to focus on the research studies under the long Covid heading.\n\nI assert that *all* the research shows that repeated, uncontrolled Covid infections increase the risk of major, long-term health issues, and *no* research suggests they don't. The bourgeoisie has every reason to want to prove that mitigations are no longer necessary, but they have produced nothing of substance. (The only exception to this would be vaccine and drug manufacturers... who would like to prove that no mitigations are necessary *except* vaccines and drug treatments.) Granted, it's hard to prove a negative - it is possible that, ten or twenty years from now, all long Covid symptoms will vanish - but I think there is simply no reason to expect that will be the case with what we know now.\n\n> The fact that only the petite-bourgeoisie seems to care about this issue might be telling.\n\nMy entire effort here has been to produce an analysis that reconciles this fact with my understanding of the scientific facts. I really do wish I was wrong about the science, more than anything else. Believe me.\n\nI will just quote from my previous post:\n\n> Perhaps the conclusion is that the overall situation is so dire and urgent that organizers cannot prioritize hard stances on Covid despite the real danger, and that would-be revolutionaries must accept the risk of Covid death or disability just as they must accept other risks as an inevitable part of struggle. But I don't think anyone is actually making this argument and committing to its implications. I mostly just see people dismissing the risk and using liberal common senses as justification, or just repeating the Biden position outright.

I'm not super well read on COVID but I think most stuff that I could read on this subject is garbage anyway (that [\"megapost\" style site](https://youhavetoliveyour.life/) you linked to is just terrible).\n\nPersonally I think the answers to your questions so far are obvious. A world without pandemics and diseases is as plainly conceivable as a world without famines. The masses are both victims *and causal agents* in relation to COVID, just as they are in relation to climate change. As far as COVID as phenomenon itself, the historical event did the majority of its terrible damage and is now waning; COVID/long COVID simply *have* decreased in severity and there's no reason to think this trend isn't continuing. As such, there are mostly retrospective opportunities now for communists and current/future sufferers of COVID/long COVID find their place in a more general band in relation to communist politics.\n\nOn another note, it's my own judgment that long COVID advocacy people are wedded to an authoritative science (thinking of that \"megapost\" site) that is devoid of any theoretical spirit and in this way can be lumped together with all the other such groups perseverating in an attempt for answers (see r/cfs, r/floxies, etc.). Thought is completely seized up when operating under the authoritative terms and the best thing that can be hoped for (in the abscence of a world that did not produce the symptom in the first place) is a stroke of innovation produced by the individual through their own terms (psychoanalysis). The next best cure is a new, productive religion (however temporary it is in itself) to replace the dead one of the medical fathers (these new religions are the various communities around authors/podcast hosts/other gurus who flip the faith upside-down: instead of faith in the reality of chronic illness, there is faith in the unreality of chronic illness).",

I do want to ask you what *specifically* you think is terrible about it. If it's the method of presentation or argument, that's fine but I would like it to at least be articulated. But as far as the research studies goes it seems to serve a functional sample to me. I do not at all claim that medical research is ideologically neutral, but if the goal is to understand Covid as a medical/scientific phenomenon, I do not think there is any other choice.\n\nI do encourage at least skimming over the research. I do go outside and see all the people living like 2019 (though they're somewhat less likely to if they're non-white or working class) and not coming home sick every day. I think that does not contradict what is beneath the surface and obscured by ideology but can be uncovered through science.\n\n> As far as COVID as phenomenon itself, the historical event did the majority of its terrible damage and is now waning; COVID/long COVID simply have decreased in severity and there's no reason to think this trend isn't continuing.\n\nThe emergency, pre-vaccine phase of millions of rapid deaths is over. It has been replaced by the post-vaccine phase, and the danger has shifted from acute death to long-term health issues. But not entirely. Deaths continue at a lower but steady rate, and hospitals in certain areas creep close to capacity when surges occur.\n\nI will consider the danger to be on its way out if infections go monotonically towards zero, or if research shows that long Covid is curable or temporary. These are not impossible conditions, but neither has happened yet.\n\n> Personally I think the answers to your questions so far are obvious.\n\nIt seems to me that the answers are only obvious if you believe Covid is no longer a major public health issue. If I cannot persuade you of that, or at least get you to accept it for the duration of this discussion, then I don't think there's anywhere for us to go, except for psychoanalyzing why I'm delusional. I can just reassure you of how few people, much less communists, share my position, and if we are wrong - and I would be happy to be wrong - we will all fade away in a few years from our current position of irrelevance.\n\n> On another note, it's my own judgment that long COVID advocacy people are wedded to an authoritative science (thinking of that \"megapost\" site) that is devoid of any theoretical spirit and in this way can be lumped together with all the other such groups perseverating in an attempt for answers (see r/cfs, r/floxies, etc.).\n\nI'm having trouble with the rest of this paragraph, but if I am understanding you correctly here - yes, I do agree that these people are very impaired in their ability to think about and act upon the problem as a social problem (as are all liberals), and I think they have about as much hope of finding physical or social relief or of changing the situation as any other victim of capitalist healthcare. I do not think this means their medical issues are imagined or self-inflicted. There are many issues with scientism but that does not mean the science can be thrown out wholesale.\n\n> This is just impossible so you should just tell us what you really believe, instead.\n\nAlright. What I want is for communists to treat Covid as a continued public health issue that impacts organizing - from recruitment and outreach, to preserving the health of membership, to publicly upholding the truth about Covid in word and in action as a demonstration of socialist principles. I do not think this necessarily means the same thing in every single situation, but as a starting point, let's say encouraging or requiring masks in some capacity as a matter of discipline. At minimum, communists should stop dismissing those who ask for precautions as unreasonable hypochondriac freaks or obsessive, controlling weirdos or whatever. If they are unable to make some accommodation due to lack of resources, or because they believe it interferes with organizing or something, they should be honest about that.  The reason should not be \"I don't feel like it\" or \"I don't care\".\n\nAll this, again, rests on us agreeing on Covid remaining a major public health issue. I hate to hammer on this point as I would be much more interested in talking about other things that have been mentioned, but, in the spirit of sticking my neck out, I do feel you have pushed me into it in a way that red_star_erika did not.",

Personally I don't care at all what tactical considerations the DSA or PSL make, and with them eliminated I'm curious what communists you're even talking about. As far as barriers to actual communist work in the imperialist core, infectious disease seems negligible, as you suspect. Whether or not communists should wear masks these days when engaging in specific tasks is probably worth some investigation in their specific contexts, sure.\n\nBut honestly your class analysis of COVID prevention/elimination advocacy is doing what you said you don't want to do about having personal feelings and working backwards to theory. You're asking us to assume all this CDC/Bernie Sanders stuff about \"public health\" (so I guess they're not really personal feelings) and then trying to find out why it's actually bourgeois to *not* care about it. And then of course the petty bourgeoisie gets centered in all of this as \"wrong in form but not in content\". It's just a tired, dogmatic routine that we do all the time here (this is what I meant by Achilles heel) and I don't buy it.\n\nI don't deny COVID is an ongoing biological threat, nor do I deny that it causes significant biological damage in both the short term (of course) and on the order of months (at least). As you see I do have a problem with the demand that we reduce science to biomedicine, and that non-medical phenomena, such as the demand itself, are not scientific objects. ME/CFS advocacy groups make such a demand and it's central to their pathology. Maybe this demand is not the only thing you're doing in these posts, but there are echoes of it and so I suspect this is a relevant conversation to have, especially considering the symptomological proximity of long COVID to ME/CFS. ME/CFS advocates complain about a \"medical gaslighting\" where their symptoms are responded to with a dismissive \"your problems are 'imagined or self-inflicted'\". This gaslighting isn't located centrally with the clinical physician, who is of course biased towards the apparently favorable direction (biomedical reductionism). Instead, the complaint is directed at the whole of society for treating them as \"unreasonable hypochondriac freaks or obsessive, controlling weirdos or whatever\". Because any alternative is reduced to the symptoms being treated as \"imagined or self-inflected\", a complicated scientism is chosen (biomedical reductionism is a slightly more specific term here, but doesn't come close to describing the complexity). All of this despite the fact that clearly medicine has absolutely nothing to offer to ME/CFS, only fundamentally ineffectual painkillers, blood pressure meds, and anti-depressants.\n\nAgain what I'm saying about ME/CFS applies almost equally to long COVID; COVID does have the potential to leave mechanical scars all over the body (the majority of which do actually seem to resolve over the span of a year, based on what I've seen from clinics treating long COVID patients), but the most common and durable long COVID symptoms are ME/CFS symptoms. Masks might save us from viruses but they won't save us from ME/CFS, and I don't think communists have had much to say about ME/CFS. Should they? I found this psychoanalytic paper interesting: [Fatigue as the unconscious refusal of the demands of late capitalism](https://repository.canterbury.ac.uk/download/51da96ebd72ed68e5cd667a4615df11f24fb7c791c6c7cfc3bcadf82436dd75e/226666/Blinded%20Manuscript%20Version%203%20PDF.pdf). The author does not \"throw out science wholesale\", nor do they reduce symptoms to being \"imagined\", but they do offer \"another choice\".",

You're asking us to assume all this CDC/Bernie Sanders stuff about \"public health\" (so I guess they're not really personal feelings) and then trying to find out why it's actually bourgeois to not care about it. And then of course the petty bourgeoisie gets centered in all of this as \"wrong in form but not in content\". It's just a tired, dogmatic routine that we do all the time here (this is what I meant by Achilles heel) and I don't buy it.\n\nCould you state what it is you think I'm asking you to assume? I thought \"ongoing biological threat\" was the core of it. (I responded the way I did because it was not clear to me that you were not denying it. And even then, if we can't agree on *how* bad it is - whether or not the current level of \"response\" is adequate - then we're still pretty stuck.) So am I mixing personal feelings into that or not?\n\nI've been clear about my petit-bourgeois bias. I am humble about my limited ability to find the proletarian line. But I have doubts that the proletarian line means accepting that the way Covid is being addressed now, at the personal/social/political level, is correct and that there are no correctives to be made.\n\nIn any case, I object to the association of my position with the CDC. (And all I know about Sanders is that he's called for long Covid research and patient support and stuff.) Covid advocates consider the CDC's position vacillating at best and traitorous at worst. The CDC centralizes the research, but their policy for the past four years has been in the service of getting back to business as usual - to only allow Covid to be addressed to the extent that minimizes disruption to capital, and to obscure the way it is presented to the public. We agree that they serve the bourgeoisie, but your understanding of how they do that seems to differ from mine.\n\nI think the discussion about ME/CFS and especially scientism is worthwhile, but I'm not equipped for a complete response and only have time to skim that paper right now. I agree with you that the scientism that reduces science to biomedicine is a common fault and weakness of ME/CFS and long Covid advocates. I thought I, too, was calling for applying science to all these phenomena. And if this is heading towards the conclusion that the parts of long Covid that matter need only be confronted after we end capitalism, then I fear we will be back at our impasse.",

[The former](https://www.cdc.gov/covid/long-term-effects) calls long COVID a \"serious public health concern\" and [the latter](https://archive.is/zuLUn) an \"ongoing public health emergency\". My point is that we're only at an impasse if we set off from their ready-made understanding of COVID/long COVID.\n\nAnd I don't mean to discourage investigation into the influence of class on COVID/disability advocacy. If anything I urge you to take your investigation to the masses. I do think COVID and COVID advocacy are becoming more and more a matter of ME/CFS and so the questions should be focused through that fact.\n\nBut of course ME/CFS was already a widespread condition before COVID and it's never been mentioned around here. I'm interested in functional disorders like ME/CFS and other such urgent \"maladies of the day\" (railway spine, duodenal ulcers, etc.) because of what they reveal to us about life (under capitalism) that cannot be thought. The \"public health emergency\" of duodenal ulcer incidence, for example, vanished from the historical scene once the ulcers' supposed origin could be thought (it was authoritatively explained by medicine but the Nobel Prize winning explanation of H. pylori is a total farce), and thus the symptom had to find expression by some non-gastric means. How relevant these questions are to communist organization I'm not sure. Probably more relevant than video games, yeah.",

I'm only skimming but that's weird to see written down in a research paper. Reminds me of Freud very confidently listing the fixed meanings of various symbols in a short section of the *Interpretation of Dreams*. As with Freud, we should disregard any supposed transhistoricity of meaning. But perhaps we can place this wacky etiology in context of the rise and fall of the ulcer epidemic? I don't have much to say about that yet. I'm repeating myself but again the most amazing thing about stomach ulcers is that it wasn't just the rate of successful treatment that increased after the discovery of the role of H. pylori, but it was the *rate of incidence* that completely fell off: people stopped contracting stomach ulcers in the first place, without any widespread changes in diet, H. pylori load (to this day most people harbor this bacterium), or \"stress\". In the absence of any other explanation, like I said I believe it was the authoritative explanation of H. pylori itself proven by the successful treatment of the symptom by attacking a final link in the causal chain that made the incidence (the practical genesis of the causal chain) vanish over a few years. Apparently stomach ulcers were a fragile enough disease by that point and certainly ME/CFS is not there today; despite the demands of ME/CFS advocates, all medical publications include the reminder that the medical community has no authoritative explanation of the causality involved in ME/CFS.",
