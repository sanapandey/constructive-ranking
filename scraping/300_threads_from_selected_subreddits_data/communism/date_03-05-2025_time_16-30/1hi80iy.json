    "selftext": "I have a relatively ambiguous view of Barre, although I tend to see more positive aspects than negative ones. This sort of sympathy is more of a first impression than genuine sympathy, as I have not studied the issue enough. Even so, based on my limited reading, I can say, with some insecurity I must admit, that there are elements that seem interesting and initially spark my sympathy, but I don't have a fully defined stance because, as I\u2019ve said, I need more reading on the subject. The aspects I value positively, for now, are his struggle for Somalia's political and economic autonomy, as well as the construction of Somali unity, fighting against tribalism, for example. These two objectives reflect an anti-colonial and emancipatory project against external interference. However, I cannot overlook the repressive policies he implemented towards certain clans, particularly against the Isaaq clan in the north, whose actions many describe as genocidal. While I understand the context in which these events unfolded, the use of brutal military violence against ordinary civilians can never be justified, because it is not only morally wrong but also undermines the construction of the revolutionary project. Lastly, I find the synthesis of Marxist principles with Islamic faith intriguing, although I do not have a firm stance on it. I believe it has a very beautiful dialectic, though. I see that this sort of \"aufheben\" shapes a highly original project, born from the very cultural and social context of Somalia, adapting to the needs and characteristics of the Somali people.\n\nThat said, if anyone has any readings to recommend in order to refine my understanding of the Somali experience, I would greatly appreciate it. I would like your views on the Somalia experience and Siad Barre leadership.",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them.

The Somali dream is to overcome the colonial past and achieve the unity of the five points of the star. The people of Ogaden suffered abuse and oppression at the hands of Ethiopia; they were tired of being humiliated and oppressed\u2014they wanted unity with Somalia. Mengistu was extremely hostile toward the ethnic groups in Ogaden. Barre fought to free his people from oppression, to defend the will of the Ogaden people, and to overcome the humiliation of the colonial past.\n\nUnder the very principle of self-determination of peoples, violated by Mengistu, the people of Ogaden were fighting for their liberation. The liberation of Ogaden is the unity with Somalia.",
