    "selftext": "Yesterday, as you probably are aware, there was an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat by the military in Bolivia. Gladly the coup failed and the conspirators were arrested.\n\nAnyway, although it was amazing seeing the masses of Bolivia gathering around to defend their progressive government and to beat up the soldiers, it is the second time in a short time span that there is an attempt to overthrow the left wing goverments that have been governing Bolivia.\n\nOn one hand, and this is the first topic i want to discuss, it seems that the fascists might return to power eventually in Bolivia, considering that the leaders of Bolivia fail in repressing the counterevolucionaires appropriately and in implementing a dictatorship of the proletariat, the only thing that can truly secure the gains made by the recent governments and advance them either further with the installation of a socialist planned economy.\n\nHowever, and this is the other thing I want to talk about, it seems that the conventional reactionary coups aren't really working anymore, atleast in South America. It seems to me, (and I may be wrong, I haven't study this properly) that coups nowadays are taking different forms, like the one that happened in Brazil against Dilma or the ones from time to time that sort of happen in Portugal or Spain (there was an succesful one last year in Portugal, and an failed one in Spain). It seems that the modern coups happen with the Justice System inventing accusations against slightly (very slightly) progressive governments and forcing new elections and a new right wing government.\n\nAnyways, I would like to hear your thoughts on this, both on Bolivia and Coups in general.

            "body": "I honestly question whether Dilma's impeachment can actually be described as a coup. To me what happened was simply bourgeois legality working as intended and PT's government, weak, bankrupt and completely lacking any revolutionary character being unable to resist this by mobilizing the masses.\n\nThere isn't much difference between an impeachment proceeding in a presidential system and a vote of no confidence in a parliamentary system in practice, at least according to the law regulating it here in Brazil. The legal difference would be that an impeachment process can only be initiated if the office holder committed a \"crime of responsibility\" but these are so numerous and some of them so minute in importance that basically every administration ends up committing them at some point, so the only thing preventing them from facing an impeachment proceeding is their support in Congress  (no different from a vote of no confidence in a parliamentary system) which by late 2015 Dilma was completely lacking in after losing backing from a faction of the bourgeoisie.\n\nOf course, there was imperialist meddling and pressure to remove PT from power, but this is to be expected in any ostensibly leftist government in a semi-colonial country and if an actually revolutionary movement where in power there would be no meddling from behind the scenes but open threats, sanctions and financial backing of fascist contras to remove them as happened in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua and seems to be occurring in Bolivia now.\n\nThere is a world of difference between Dilma having no wide support among the masses and thus being removed from power in such a pathetic way and Jo\u00e3o Goulart and Allende being forced to resign at gunpoint. Although the latter where not communist in any way they had a revolutionary character and backing from the masses and thus the only way to remove them was violence or the threat of violence.\n\nJango for example faced impeachment attempts more than once before the coup I believe but Congress did not remove him because he still had some support from the national bourgeoisie and widespread backing from the masses, so they understood his removal  could trigger widespread instability and perhaps an insurrection/civil war. Only after the reactionary sectors in the military were organized enough and had the guarantee of full American support did they make the move, which included docking a fully loaded Aircraft Carrier on a Brazilian port to intervene if it became necessary. Brazil was the most important component in US planning for South America and I remember a quote from Kennedy stressing that under no circumstance could Brazil be allowed to become \"another Cuba\".\n\nThese purported \"coups\" in Portugal and Spain seem even more pathetic, as far as I know in Portugal's case only an investigation was initiated and the \"Socialist\" Prime Minister resigned to preserve the \"integrity of the office\". There was no struggle or attempt to resist through popular pressure, just immediate capitulation.",

                    "body": "I am not completely familar with Brazil, so I will give you that one, althought I think what happened was more that \"bourgeois legality\". Even thought Lula was a social-democrat (now more like a liberal, and Dilma too) and was never going to poss a real threat to capitalism in Brazil, he still represented a mass movement in the begging. It is not as much what Lula was but what was behind Lula, that is the thread of the masses of Brazil organized. Nowadays, as far as I am aware, the PT has lost its popular base support structures almost completely, and is pretty much indistiguible from a typical social-democrat party in the imperialist core.\n\nHaving said this, i believe that yes, the justice system in Brazil acted upon removing Dilma (and more importantly arresting Lula - who was a symbol of the masses in Brazil) throught what might be considered a coup. Even social-democrats and sometimes liberals can, in some cases, threaten the (at least immediate) interests of the bourgeoisie. Allende was not a communist (thought obviously to the left of Lula) but he still suffered a coup.\n\nAs for Portugal and Spain, what happened was obviously an coup, even if the PS (Socialist Party) and the PSOE (Socialist Party of Workers of Spain) are neoliberal trash. Portugal had an goverment with an absolute majority, the public ministry made up a charge, arrested a bunch of people including the prime minster chief-of-staff, and the prime-minister was forced to resign. There were new elections and now we have a new right-wing government. In the meantime no evidence has been proven true and most charges have been dropped. Still the damage is done: Costa resigned and the goverment fell. How is this not a coup?\n\nKeep in mind that there has been a \"scandal\" because politicians of the PS have been wired for a bunch of years and the tapes have comed out strategically during election times and now again when Costa is running for the Presidency of the European Council. It is very clear that the justice system is against him (for whatever reason, since he is in no way a threat to the bourgeoisie).\n\nIn Spain the same thing has been attempted, with cases and \"evidence\" surrounding the prime-minister Pedro Sanchez wife coming out and pressuring him to resign. The difference is unlike Costa he didnt, but it is somewhat likely that they might come for him again in the future. Again, I also don't think Sanchez is anything but a liberal politican, but they still want to put him out.\n\nNota: Respondo-te em ingl\u00eas para que mais pessoas possam ver e eventualmente participar na discuss\u00e3o.

                            "body": "I'm not arguing here that these judicial persecutions are somehow legitimate, what I'm arguing is that the whole bourgeois legal system is illegitimate and primarily a tool of class oppression. As a result, it can be used to serve nearly whatever purpose a certain faction of the bourgeoisie wants. Judges and prosecutors are political actors and the decision to prosecute a certain adversary for corruption is more a matter of political feasibility then legality, evidence or due process, judicial impartiality is a myth. Lula is corrupt as all politicians are corrupt, they are simply not prosecuted/arrested because it is politically unfeasible or undesirable to do so. When a politician does get arrested it most often occurs because he was part of the faction that lost a power struggle not because of justice being done. Corruption is a meaningless crime under capitalism and merely a tool to prosecute political adversaries.\n\nThis is why I question this discourse around Lula and Dilma that a \"coup\" occurred among us communists. It seems we are defending bourgeois legality on it's own terms, as if the legal system were somehow legitimate and something to be defended and this coup is an aberration of some sort. It clearly is lawfare but it only seems to be getting used ever more frequently as you mention, not something totally new and unexpected.\n\nIn Dilma's case we can't even call it lawfare really because she was simply ousted by the Congress. Impeachment proceedings in Brazil are not judicial but political as is the case in the US, the deputies and senators that vote on it don't even have a purported duty to maintain impartiality during the trial as it would be ridiculous to expect that from politicians, so the charges themselves are meaningless. \n\nI shit you not, one of the crimes of responsibility that can lead to impeachment on Brazil is \"to behave in a way that is incompatible with the dignity, honor and decorum of the office\". What does this even mean? It is completely subjective and up to the congressman to decide.\n\nThe only reason more American presidents have not been successfully impeached is because of the two party system, which basically prevents it. In Brazil this does not exist as there are multiple parties and none of them can ever get a majority let alone a supermajority. As a result, most administrations are at a constant risk of impeachment from the get go unless they continually bribe the Congress to keep it on it's side.\n\nA coup needs to involve a direct use of violence or the threat of violence as I see it. It is a forcing of the hand, when a certain faction of the bourgeoisie or other oppressive class has no more cards to play they need to resort to it to secure their own power/influence/existence. In these lawfare cases the bourgeois politicians and parties are simply being outplayed in their own game, which is why no attempts of resisting through mass mobilization are even considered.\n\nNote: I edited my original posted because I had written that Kennedy said Brazil could not become another China, it seems the quote mentioned Cuba. not China. Also I wrote Operation Condor but it officially did not exist during the 60s, the name of the Operation was Brother Sam. It also seems the Aircraft Carrier never actually reached Brazil, only departed from the US, as the coup was quickly successful and Jango went into exile, having asked Brizola not to attempt armed resistance out of fear of Civil War.",

Still, I would still argue that a coup doesn't need to happen in a conventional way with violence, at least with the all the typical millitary aparatus. I think violence exists in a lot of instances were it seems like it isn't there. In fact, I would go further and say that to be a communist implies breaking with the typical liberal dicotomy of what is violent and what isn't. A President being arrested, specially one with a sort of mass movement around him, is actually a very violent and repressive process. Violence exists in every aspect of life because capitalism is violent. Of course this doenst mean that everything is at the same level of violence, it would be stupid of me to say that the impeachment we are discussing is as violent (at least in image) as the coup that took out Allende for an example. But for an example, the simple fact that Bolsonaro becamed President and did what it did during covid, provoking hundreds of thousands of deaths in excess that any normal liberal politican would have not (including Lula) shows how not doing something or not acting can be just as violent as doing. If we assume the impeachment provoked Bolsonaro reaching power, then yes the coup was extremely violent. Not that Lula or any other politicans from PT dont provoke deaths themselves either, both directly and by inaction, but still Bolsonaro provoked more that they would I would argue.",
