            "body": "Every single one of your premises is wrong. You need to learn more about the history of South Asian politics (specifically Pakistan), Maoist critique of Soviet revisionism and gain a better understanding of revolutionary politics. \n\nThe Soviets feared Pakistanian militants who were trying to take over Afghanistan and turn the country into a US puppet instead of being their puppet. \n\n> a intervention in iran seemed to me to make more sense than afghanistan where reactionary groups were already prepared for a long war of iteration\n\nThis is hindsight bias. The situation and what to do in Iran were not at all clear, and the Tudeh party was not really seen as the revolutionary communist party by Iranians in comparison to, say, the Fedei. \n\nHafiz did not solely lead the revolution. It was the Khaliqs and the military base he helped establish within the Afghanistan Army that made the Saur Revolution decisive. \n\n>and his execution's of marxism policy seems to be a disaster almost as if intentional to start a up rising\n\nThat is a good thing. Yes reactionaries, tribal elites and landowners will violently resist the communist government attempts at land reform. Class struggle is intensified, not quelled. \n\n>plus he made limited reforms and i did not find any letters of him asking for tactical or maybe policy help from soviets instead just demands of equipment that is not useful in hands of conscripts\n\nAfghanistan became reliant on the Soviet Union because Iran and Pakistan relations were so strained that trade was inconsistent. The PDPA did accept Soviet help with the intention of trying to reduce its dependence on the Soviet Union. \n\nThe Soviets did not plan at all for the Saur Revolution and were taken off guard. They had to retroactively claim support for the PDPA government to maintain their socialist legitimacy to the third world. The Khaliq played along with it because it benefited them at the moment, but in reality, the Soviets were perfectly ok with Daoud and his reactionary policies. The Soviets main support base in the PDPA was the revisionist Parchamites. Amin was too revolutionary for the Soviets and his land reform would have threatened the Soviet revenue of taxes and customs that were used to repay their loans to Afghanistan and were collected on trade routes from Pakistan and China.\n\nAmin tried setting up the National Organisation for the Defence of the Revolution, which encouraged the classes of Afghanistan to participate in the revolutionary process, very similar to the Revolutionary Committees in China. Conspicuously after the Soviet intervention, the organization was disbanded and was never mentioned again by the PDPA government, hmmm... I wonder why.\n\nRevolutionary Afghanistan is probably the most misunderstood country by Marxists and is shrouded in a ton of lies due to Soviets, China, America and the Parchamites trying to cover their own asses and advocate for their own interests. Supposedly there were books published by the Khaliqs regarding what actually happened but I have not found them translated or have even really seen them online. I would not take any claim about Amin being a CIA asset seriously (in the article you linked Gulabzoi was a noted member of the Pro-Soviet clique that surrounded Taraki).",

They created unions, peasant cooperatives, and other advocacy groups under their leadership. \n\nIn 1968, a newspaper titled \"Shola-i-Javid\" began publishing, which was \"Maoist,\" i.e., they supported China in international politics, including supporting Pakistan like China did. While the Khaliq were pro-soviet union, they both united over their anti-Parchamite politics and you could have supported both at the time. When the Khaliq were disillusioned by the Soviet Union in 1979, the Shola-i-Jivad became their allies and helped try to find alternatives via China and Pakistan. \n\nThe Settam-e Melli was another Maoist oppositional group. They split from the PDPA over their disagreement on Pashtun dominance. The PDPA took the side of the majority Pashtun to create a Pashutunistan country, while the Settem-e-Melli opposed this and was composed primarily of the ethnic minorities of Afghanistan, such as the Tajik and Uzbeks. During the Soviet-Afghan war the group actually decided to integrate themselves into the Parchamite government under Kabral so the end result of the group was revisionist politics. \n\nThere were a few uprisings by \"Anti-Khalq Marxists\" that allied with moderate Islamist (i.e. reactionaries) to try and change the government. Objectively, this would have resulted in a military coup that put the Parchamites in charge.\n\nAll the other groups that opposed the Khalq eventually fell into revisionism, integration with the Parchamites, deepening Soviet reliance, or collaboration with the Afghan mujahideen. What makes Khaliq unique to me is that they recognized the issue of Soviet dependence and tried to pivot themselves away from it in a progressive manner. They tried to keep every alternative avenue open. Consequently, you see many confusing statements by them and accusations of trying to buddy up with the US, China, or Pakistan. \n\nThe ethnic question was also a big point of contention regarding what constituted the revolutionary line. I would probably need to do more research into it to confidently say whether a Pashtunistan line was ethnic chauvinism or not. The Khalq was actually ambivalent on the issue compared to the Parchamites, and it was mainly used rhetorically to appeal to the pro-Daoud officers in the military. The Khalq did promote ethnic minority languages and promised to preserve the cultures of the ethnic minorities. Any acknowledgment of pursuing Pashtunistan militarily would have closed the door for further relations with Pakistan.",

Especially given the Hazara genocide and the chauvinism there. I don't think it's true that all the other groups that opposed the Khalq eventually fell into revisionism because there is still a Maoist party in Afghanistan which emerged from various anti-revisionist trends. Yes, groups such as the ALO, Settam-e Melli, PYO, Salvation Organization, etc... all eventually either dissolved or fell to revisionism, but that does not mean that their opposition to the Khalq was the reason for it, nor does that mean the Khalq was better.   \n  \nHow did the failure of the Daoud government and their coalition of forces convince the Khalq of that? I am willing to admit that the Khalq may have been anti-feudal, but whether or not Afghanistan was led by the proletariat is a entirely different question. Do you know what happened with Shola-i-Jivad after the Saur Revolution?",

Today's Maoist are the continuation of the PYO.\n\n> How did the failure of the Daoud government and their coalition of forces convince the Khalq of that?\n\nThe first united front between the PDPA and Khan was blatant opportunism and the party paid dearly for it. They did not get much benefit from the alliance and their reward was purges and delegitimization among their bases. For the Khalq, any alliance with other political groups would eventually deteriorate as they were pursuing their own specific line that would clash with other groups political aspirations. The only reason why the Khalq and Parchamites reconciled was to make the conditions for the Saur Revolution possible (a long sustaining military coup needed cooperation of the Parchamite dominated bureaucracy). \n\nHazara questions is a bit more complicated. Hazaras were members in in the PDPA (predominately in the Parchamites though). The big split was urban and rural. The Iran Revolution sparked a political-religious consciousness among the rural Hazara and was motivated to fight against all forms of communism.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_Hazara_Uprising\n\nThe idea of Pashtunistan interests more for its consequences than sympathy to the Pashtun people. Pursuing it would have led to a war with Pakistan and the spread of abolishing feudal relations on the west side of Pakistan. You can easily imagine how the event would reshape Asia. \n\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/3011832\n\nI highly recommend reading this article. It's a very good overview of the shortcomings of the Khalq faction and its ideology. They were trying to break free of the ideological constraints and material conditions of their own parties existence to abolish feudalism. The short-lived party's existence and regime make their failures more apparent as any mistake would have disastrous repercussions. It took years for the Peruvian party to build reliable connections with the Andres mountain peasants and even they were sharply rejected by peasants in various towns. \n\nAfghanistan had a very small proletariat and it was concentrated in Kabul. The best evidence I can give right now among the Khalq support among the proleteriat is a quote from Beverely Male\n\n>After the split in the PDPA in 1966/7, the Khalq strategy was to carry on party work among the masses. The wave of strikes in 1968 and 1969 in some of the largest factories in the major centres suggests they may have had some success. Strikes took place in Kabul at the National Printing House and the Jangalak Industrial Workshop, the latter erupting into violence; at Jabal-as-Saraj, involving workers at the cement plant and other industrial workers, as well as the nearby Afghan Textile Co. factory at Gulbahar; at Pul-i-Khumri in the Afghan Textile Co. factory and the cement works; at Kunduz, at the Spinzar Company. In Kunduz and Pul-i-Khumri the workers were supported by peasants and students, and students also\ndemonstrated in support of striking workers at Jabal-as-Saraj. \n\nand Amin's confidence in declaring it to be a proleterian revolution. \n\nThe big question for me is: what is the placement of the DRA in communist history? I found their path for capturing state power very unique and it doesn't fit with squarely with other socialist countries (similar to Cuba's revolution using Foquismo). As the Maoist article points out, the revolution likely succeeded and was maintained due to Maoist efforts to raise the class consciousness of oppressed classes in Afghan society to break out of the feudal relations; the cultural revolution in China greatly contributed to this as well. I think the Maoists were making a mistake in denouncing parliamentary activities, they conceded an area of struggle over to the PDPA in the newly fledged parliamentary system. The PDPA mistakes were not being organized well enough to handle their opponents and not conducting ideological struggle over revisionism. It was a little too late to realize that putting all their eggs on the Soviet Union was not a very good idea. The Maoists suffered from similar organization problems at the beginning, the difference between them and the Khalq was that the latter knew how to to achieve state power with the hand they were dealt.",

I found it challenging to write it concisely and fluently without relying too much on quotes. There seems to be increased interest in Afghanistan lately, so I might rewrite it and limit its scope more. I do think the Saur Revolution and subsequent reforms are worth more attention and research from communists and it does teach us about the nature of semi-feudal communist revolutions and how Soviet revisionism served global imperialism \n\nI'm not too sure how repeatable the Afghanistan revolution today is. The basis of the revolution was a military base that was not loyal to the government but the promise of reforms and a will for irredentism of the Pashtunistan territories from Pakistan. If I wrote it out and pondered it more, I probably could find a satisfying conclusion to the entire saga.",
