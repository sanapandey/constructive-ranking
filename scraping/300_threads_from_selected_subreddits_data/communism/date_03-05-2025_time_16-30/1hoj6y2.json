You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This creates a divide on which MLs view the vanguard party and state (dictatorship of the proletariat or DOTP for short) as a necessity to hold off counter revolution, political destabilization, embargos, invasion and other bourgeious push back attempts where as anarchists claim that the DOTP is just as oppressive and unsustainable as capitalism itself. This is where you will hear anarchists make the common claim that ML governments are just \"state capitalism\". This is the central dividing point.\n\nHistorically there is a long history (albeit not as long or brutal of a history as capitalists have with anti capitalists) of MLs and anarchists, once revolution has \"begun\", turning against one another which has created resentment/distrust as well on both sides\n\nTbf I'm a ML, so I view the DOTP as a necessity to sustain the revolution beyond just the overthrow of a government, as anarchist revolutions have a decent enough history for me of failed revolutions and poor defense and collaboration against capitalist counter revolution for me to kinda disregard anarchism as a whole. That's just my two cents on it.",

The fact Marx did that doesn't actually tell us anything meaningful about how Leninism developed.

I just don't think anarchism has sufficiently actionable theory or framework through which to achieve the end goal of statelessness and classlessness. They view any and all authority as bad, seemingly conflating \"authority\" with \"state\", and seem to think that stateless, classless society will simply materialize spontaneously after revolution against capitalism.\n\nAnarchists and anarchist philosophy tend to come from either the bourgeoisie or petit bourgeois, not the proletariat. They engage in idealism that either downplays or ignores the  role and material reality of class conflict throughout history. There's a reason many anarchists were previously libertarian.",

In this transition, class antagonisms persist and the goal \"to each according to their need, from each according to their ability\" is not yet physically feasible; but the levers of state power and democratic control are granted to the people in a real way, not just nominally as in liberal democracy.\n\nLenin says anarchists find the transitional state to unacceptable and that they want to rush straight to communism, which is impractical.",

The entire point of Lenin in *Better Fewer but Better* is that small numbers of authentic communists with a deep level of theoretical understanding is far more effective and worth far more than a large organization with many more members lacking in correct politics.  They real essence of the problem is that anarchists don't even actually exist anymore -- the people you are engaging with are just generic liberals who want to disassociate their identities from liberalism, and that none of them (nor you) have organized or radicalized at all, you've just swapped the slogans of liberalism for new slogans of liberalism, and their \"organizations\" are just liberal hobby groups which have not escaped from liberalism at all, and are incapable of offering any real opposition to liberalism (in fact, they are it's reinforcements during crises -- see how many reddit anarchists went to fight for Ukraine and how zero of them have gone to fight for Palestine).",

The Russian Marxists (Plekkanov, Lenin, Stalin, etc.) disproved its opportunism in the early 1900s (back when utopian socialism actually had a chance to usurp revolutionary movements) and since its failure in Spain it has served as nothing but a phase teenage liberals go through. \"Anarchists\" believe that under communism they will be allowed to get all the videogames for free and never work and everyone else would do the labor to uphold the global supply chains which fund their hobbies because they'd feel like it. This is not the \"same end goal\" as Communism and even Kropotkin would spit in the faces of these people. They have not had any appeal to the masses or significance since the USSR and China proved that dialectical and historical materialism were the only correct path to socialism.",

Your arguments are a bunch of hollow phrases and aren't Marxism. This thread excellently demonstrates why anarchism has no appeal to anyone but the most desperately hopeless first world liberals nowadays.\n\nEdit: I hope this thread also demonstrates to someone why it is futile to try and convince anarchists of Marxism when their class interests and liberal ideology are fundamentally against it.

Is it \"Sectarianist\" to insist on Darwinism over Religion?\n\n\nAnd Anarchists have not, as a trend, been on the Same Side as Communists in the Class Struggle as every time Anarchists have sided with their Petite Bourgeois Class Basis and fought against the Proletariat.\n\n\n> Anarchists and communists will be side by side at the trenches, after the revolution, we'll be antagonists and we must know that.\n\n\nNo \"We\" will not be side by side, if Anarchists are ever with the people it is in the United front against enemies of the People *if* they actually side with the people against Reaction.\n\n\n> Social democrats, anarchists, ML and MLM all have differences, but they all want the proletarian good\n\n\nSocial Fascists want to keep their spoils of Imperialism just like Anarchists.

But what the workers\u2019 cause needs is the unity of Marxists, not unity between Marxists, and opponents and distorters of Marxism.\n\n\n> [...]\n\n\n> No flirting with the liquidators, no diplomatic negotiations with groups of wreckers of the corporate body; concentrate all efforts on rallying the Marxist workers around the Marxist slogans, around the entire Marxist body. The class-conscious workers will regard as a crime any attempt to impose upon them the will of the liquidators; they will also regard as a crime the fragmentation of the forces of the genuine Marxists.\n\n\n...\n\n\n> but I don't think that sectarianism is good for organizing the workers class.\n\n\nThen you have never understood Lenin at all in [Better Fewer But Better](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1923/mar/02.htm).",
