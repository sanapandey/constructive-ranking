Every time they are brought up in a discussion online, it seems like people only have the most vile sounding racist shit to say about them. All I ever see are comments that border on genocidal rhetoric, so I don\u2019t really trust any liberal opinion about them. What are the forces that cause them to be treated so despicably? And what conditions do they face? I\u2019m in America for context.\n",

            "body": "Hello!\n\nI\u2019m an actual Rom ([*Kalo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnish_Kale), to be exact).\n\nI\u2019m generally concerned about being targeted with slander \u2014 lo and behold, most places here on Reddit don\u2019t like people like me \u2014, but I hope I don\u2019t have to deal with that stuff on this subreddit.\n\nRight, so, I\u2019m going to try to answer your questions. It might not be a proper analysis *per se*, but at least it\u2019s the words of a Rom and fellow comrade on what it\u2019s like to live under oppressive terms in an otherwise progressive nation.\n\nHere goes\u2026\n\nA prominent theme is having to hide one\u2019s Roma identity. Many of us are not or have not always been open about our Roma identity, and in different contexts we weigh up when we can be open or not. Most of the people I know, including my family and relatives, state that they are proud of their Roma identity, but hide it because of the risk of discrimination and prejudice. Thus, antiziganism creates what may appear to be a paradox, but should be interpreted as two sides of the same coin: on the one hand, it forces us into invisibility, reinforcing the image of a homogeneous country and demands for assimilation; on the other hand, it entails the risk of being overlooked, in the sense of being subjected to more surveillance, control, questions and boundlessness, and being forced to represent an entire group. Crucially, many hold that they are proud to be Roma, but that our ability to be so in public is restricted, if not impossible.\n\nI, for example, can talk about my own experiences of generational trauma and minority stress. I can also testify to how it has negatively affected my life and mental health, if need be. There is also the minority stress in everyday life, where constant worry and stress affect one\u2019s health. Different approaches to dealing with these stresses in everyday life that can be highlighted include strategies such as hiding and toning down one\u2019s Roma identity, being extra vigilant at all times and avoiding certain places and situations. Generational trauma, then, primarily concerns the Romani Holocaust, but slavery and the long history of discrimination are also examples of such trauma. Amongst these are those that my ancestors have experienced due to their Roma identity and that these ones have become part of my own identity. A recurring theme is the lack of recognition of these traumas in the majority society, which makes it difficult to deal with them sufficiently and has created extensive grief and, to say the least, anger.\n\nExperiences of antiziganism are experienced in all spheres of society \u2014 from one\u2019s workplace to the grocery store just down the street, from school to encounters with the authorities and the police \u2014 and can take many forms. There is also the issue with structural economic inequality based on historical exclusion from, amongst other things, large parts of the labor market and contemporary widespread discrimination in both the workplace and the education system. A serious result is widespread experience of antiziganism in schools. This is expressed both through open antiziganism in the form of bullying and victimization and through silence from teachers and other students, where antiziganism is allowed to pass. Many of us have also experienced that teachers and other school staff lack confidence in the abilities of Roma pupils and assume that Roma parents \u201clack future ambitions and interest in education.\u201d Furthermore, there is limited knowledge and lack of visibility and recognition of Roma history in education.\n\nIn encounters with other authorities, moreover, we find experience of suspicion and questioning. It is therefore crucial to shift the focus from the fact that we Roma are \u201cinherently suspicious of authorities\u201d to the question of how authorities still create suspicion and questioning towards us as a minority. Also serious is the extent of antiziganism in public places, not least in stores, which manifests itself both in increased surveillance and in other customers\u2019 aggressive behaviors. This is experienced most painfully, obviously, in cases where children are present. Alas, despite extensive experience of discrimination, most people do not report such events. This is not only due to a lack of knowledge of the law and where to report, but also to the collective experience of not being trusted.\n\nI might\u2019ve snowballed here a bit. Sorry about that. But if you \u2014 or anyone else, for that matter \u2014 have any further questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to ask!",

            "body": "It's a good question. There is a lot of overlap between Roma and \"The Jewish Question\" which is where you will find a theoretical framework articulated. The major difference is that the creation of a Roma race of people came out of the production of vagabondage in the primitive accumulation of capitalism whereas the creation of the Jewish race came from the failure of the bourgeois revolution to overcome the contradiction between political emancipation and economic inequality (what Marx discusses in his critique of Bauer). Still, historically they overlap because race was produced at the same time throughout Europe and primitive accumulation was a broad process which included colonialism and slavery (an equally important foundation of race). But it does mean that socialist regimes, which took up the mantle of the French revolution and completed it, were hyperfocused on the emancipation of the Jews whereas the Roma question was more ambiguous as it put into question the very nature of the nation-state as a progressive force. This was an infamous issue in Romania, which was the socialist state most concerned with creating a national mythology, and it was part of a larger organization of society on terms of bourgeois individuals as citizens of a nation state. \n\nhttps://www.academia.edu/5234906/_It_must_come_from_Europe_The_Racisms_of_Immanuel_Kant\n\n>Kant employs these ideas to synchronise the Gypsy question with the \nrace question. This is a thoroughly modern operation and shows that he \nwas a supporter of the new race-oriented Gypsy stereotype, based on a \ndecisive paradigmatic change. The conception it supersedes was summarised in the entry \u00bbZiegeuner [Gypsies]\u00ab from Zedler\u2019s Universal Encyclopaedia as late as in 1749. The article states that in the \ufb01fteenth century, wandering strangers appeared in Europe. However, they either left \nagain or disappeared into the local rabble. The text concludes \u00bbthat these \nGypsies are nothing but gathered wicked riffraff who do not want to work \nbut turn idleness, stealing, whoring, gorging, boozing, playing and so on \ninto a profession\u00ab. \n\n>This diagnosis of a socially nonconformist character of the Gypsy \nis reinforced through the denunciation of two classic ascriptions of \nstrangeness, appearance and language, as mere pretence. The dark colour \nis alleged to be an arti\ufb01cial trait smeared on their skin to deceive and \nconceal their true identity. The supposedly incomprehensible language is \nclaimed to be nothing but a collusive jargon which both serves to appear \nstrange as well as interesting and enables them to communicate without \nbeing understood by others. \n\n>Until the middle of the eighteenth century, the Gypsy stereotype de- \nveloped into a category which serves to identify socially nonconformist \nbehaviour. The accusations of vagabondage and statelessness, which recur again and again and are strained intensely in Zedler, are part of this. \nThe mere masses of people without a permanent home and subordination to rule who are considered to be riffraff constitute a constant source of \nannoyance for the biopolitical population management of the develop- \ning modern state. Even though the English workhouses, French h\u00f4pitals, \nGerman Zuchth\u00e4user and Italian alberghi dei poveri \ufb02ourish at that time, \nthey do not get the problem under control. \n\n>The transformation of the \nterm Gypsy from a social into a racial category turns those into strangers \nwho refuse to become part of the system. \nThe colouring of the Gypsy concept by the new race science may \nalso have been an expression of ethnological interest. However, it mainly \nre\ufb02ects the determination to turn one\u2019s former own wandering, unproductive no-goods and beggars into alien parasites on the level of primitive nomads.\n\nThe key thing to keep in mind is the dialectic of the Enlightenment. The English Civil War was both a historically progressive moment and the brutal conquest of Ireland. The latter is not a vestige of the past but just as modern as the bourgeois itself. The same is true of modern slavery, which was much more deadly and all-encompassing because it was *capitalist* slavery as well as colonialism, which became genocidal once it was dependent on the capitalist world market (compared to, for example, the \"colonialism\" of the Mongol Empire). \n\nUnfortunately, a lot of stereotypes exist about Marxism's supposed celebration of the progressive features of the bourgeoisie and its minimization of the negatives (for example Silvia Federici's claim that Marx and Engels ignore the regression of women's rights under capitalism has become so widespread that \"social reproduction theory\" is basically interchangeable with \"Marxist feminism\" for young communists). You have to get through all of that to approach this question, which Marx wrote little about directly.\n\nI read this article before making this post to refresh my understanding of The Jewish Question:\n\nhttps://muse.jhu.edu/article/170545\n\nmaybe it will help you.",

I\u2019m not even sure if I asked my mom if she would be able to answer. our history has been lost, imo. it makes me eternally sad.
