They win one gold medal and it\u2019s a national holiday. They build their first aircraft carrier and it like they went to Mars. They build one plane and it\u2019s like they invented warp speed. Their pride in even the most mundane things is admirable. \n\nWhereas here in the U.S. Where these types of things are either old news or common. All we do is talk about what a shitty country we live in. It\u2019s as if Americans are so used to accomplishing amazing things for so long that they no longer appreciate them. \n\nWe can learn a thing or two from these people who will take every opportunity to celebrate their country. Not shit on it.",

Seeing my people happy and united make me smile, a big smile the fill my eyes with tear drops and my heart with happiness. Only we know how much the Brazilian people suffer, so we deserve to rest and breath!\n\nYou guys have your own celebrations too. You get together and have a great sense of union, but it is hard to see that from the inside. There are some really small towns in the US that really often get together just for the union, and, for me, that's celebrating the people.\n\nDon't be that hard on your own, everyone here have flaws, but [we're humans after all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXYeARRyDWk&ab_channel=DaftPunk)\n\n:)",
