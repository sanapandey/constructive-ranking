If the owners of these cars tend to be more on the inconsiderate side, that's not the vehicle's fault. A vehicle of this size needs to be handled appropriately - there's no denying that. However, if the owner is mindful of the space they occupy and makes an effort not to inconvenience others, I don\u2019t see an issue. After all, these vehicles are legal to own. You can dislike them, but their owners still have the right to have them.\n\nNow, most people aren\u2019t like that (mindful of their space occupation), but this brings us to the issue of bias. If your friend says, *\"I'm getting this big truck,\"* your immediate reaction might be, *\"not a goddamn truck\"* simply because of the bias already in your head. But what if your friend really likes that truck and actually handles it responsibly?\n\nThat said, I\u2019m not a fan of trashing other people\u2019s dreams based on bias. I\u2019ve learned to be tolerant of others' preferences, no matter how absurd they may seem to me, because at some point, I realized that not everyone likes the same things - and that\u2019s completely okay, as long as no harm is involved.",

I have to say too, switching over to mass transit has genuinely worked. Our trains are packed like sardine tins every day lol whereas 40 years ago people had to breath in genuinely toxic fumes from the diesel cars on the road while riding the bus to school.\nEngine design has improved so we genuinely have less black smoke on the streets.

And when people are jaded by the problems that these types of people cause, they react quickly and with a lot of meanness as a first line of defence. Because let's face it, there's some real bullies out there and they don't deserve your time of day. But some people catch the stray bullet and it's not fair to them.  \nIn the case with trucks, apparently it is general knowledge in the US that a lot of people with these trucks park really horribly at walmart or other public parking spaces, purposely taking up two spaces at the parking lot.  Like they just literally put their truck on top of the midway line between two spaces. Even if they try to park properly, the trucks don't fit into a single parking space. And that's straight up unfair esp on busy days. And uh, you'd have these car owners who get these trucks precisely to do these things to annoy everyone else, along with a whole list of other stuff they do.  When people see enough of it, they get mad lol ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)  They are such a car centric society, and issues to do with cars affect everyone else's daily lives sometimes.  Obviously though, there's car owners who don't do that, and exercise consideration when they drive their trucks around. At this point though I think those responsible owners would know that the vitriol isn't meant for them lol.\n\nI dunno what that's like with Europe and the UK though. Do they even sell consumer trucks that exceed the standard parking space dimensions?\n\nA case that I do know intimately, though, are these feckin sports car owners that like to roar their engines \\*\\*all throughout\\*\\* residential apartment districts at 3 A.M. in the morining! 3!!!! in the morning !\n\nOn \\*\\*\\*weekdays\\*\\*\\* no less. And they roar their engines driving everywhere, even when they pass by infants or the elderly using walking sticks. So yeah, no offense but I automatically give noisy sports cars the stink eye whenever they pass by lol.",

Let me explain why. That vehicle has a 5 foot tall blindspot directly in the front. The driver can't see any of those kids if the kids were to be standing in front of it. That's why it's irresponsible to be driving that in a neighborhood with children. It's also irresponsible to park it on the street because it obstructs the view of oncoming motorists. Those children are endangered by their vanity lifted pickup truck. Also, to a lesser severity, disable your car alarm. All a car alarm does is annoy everybody within 200 feet of your car for no reason because car alarms don't actually work to prevent theft.",

We had a bunch of kids in the neighborhood, and we would play kick ball and other games in the street.  We were adamant in not allowing balls or whatever from going near this guy's car.  He might have killed us if a ball struck it in any way, and we all didn't like him.  We were good kids and if the ball did hit the car (it never did but came close a time or two, and he would give us a look of death) we would have never told him out of fear.     \n\nFunny side note, his wife's car was in the shop, and she took the SS to her day job one day, and it was stolen.  I forget what car he got next, but things were never the same after that.  We even felt bad for the guy (he wasn't that much of a dick) because we knew how much he loved that SS.",

Instead of taking a more than fair amount of $ for the damage, or letting me repair it, they wanted to go through insurance. I didn\u2019t understand but it\u2019s their right, well turns out they threw some completely unrelated old damage saying it was caused by me and since I admitted I hit their car I wasnt even listened to. So my insurance is an extra $2500~ per year now (for 7 years from what I understand) for a at most $500 damage. I\u2019m gonna pay well over 10 grand, for a $500 damage on an old CRV. Because i thought let\u2019s do the right thing.\n\n\nPoint is being good can get you taken advantage of. Next time I\u2019m leaving an envelope with a fair amount and  leaving.

Your idea of fairness and what a good body shop would charge to fix it would be two different dollar amounts.\n\nMost people want to avoid insurance because they either don't have any or for their benefit like they have had too many claims.\n\nSucks they claimed unrelated damage but them going through insurance is reasonable, that's what it's for.
