His donations were part of every batch but his donations amount to only about 40,000 doses worth. And overall the program has saved about 10,000 making his donations responsible for about 200 of them. Which again is crazy and more meaningful because it's the real number.",

If it wasn\u2019t for the $20 he wouldn\u2019t have had enough for his motel for the night and would have froze to death. Life is interesting that way \n\nWhen I was a depressed 16 year old weed dealer I would sell weed to a women who was an addict. She saved me cus I decided I was going to end my life and I pretended I have been using so she wasn\u2019t suspicious. Hit her up to buy and even knew the proper lingo so it didn\u2019t seem weird. She said \u201cI\u2019m not selling u this shit\u201d told her I just need a $50 bag for a gram or close to it to hold me over and I\u2019d pay her $100 and she said \u201cI can\u2019t do that but u should see about going to rehab\u201d and then she blocked me. I still am convinced she blocked me cus she knew she didn\u2019t wanna sell it to me but the free money I was offering was temping and she removed the temptation. \n\nI bet she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s has saved anyone before but I was for sure going to do it the second it was dropped off. I still can\u2019t believe she said no. I know she needed the money for more drugs. I get choked up thinking about that shit. Still pray she\u2019s okay but she was very far gone. Most who go as hard as she did never come back. I\u2019d probably not even recognize her if she walked past me if she is clean now.",

In actually it was about 200. That's still an insane amount but it's actually a number that is actually true unlike the 2.4 million claim.\n\n2.4 million is how many doses (each at risk mother gets two) the whole Australian program has with the help of about 100 donors in any given year. His donations were part of every batch but his donations amount to only about 40,000 doses worth. And overall the program has saved about 10,000 making his donations responsible for about 200 of them. Which again is crazy and more meaningful because it's the real number.",

His donations were part of every batch but his donations amount to only about 40,000 doses worth.

I was just asking whether you are asking chatGPT stuff about this and doing your best to interpret what it's saying. It would seem the answer is yes you are using ChatGPT. I'm mostly interested in what it said to you about modification tools because it sounds like it was saying better CRISPR tools are necessary which is... I don't think really true. It would be pretty easy to knockout RHAG to make an Rh-null mouse for instance for study. Whilst making Rh-null blood artificially for use in humans isn't really something people are thinking about because as I said people have plans for making artificial blood and generally they'd be avoiding the issue entirely because they wouldn't put blood group markers on the artificial blood \"cells\" they're planning to use in the first place because replicating actual blood cells is way out there (and even if it weren't you could just knock out RHAG as I said) earlier.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm a biologist. Neither blood nor artificial organs are my specialty but I have the background to interpret what ChatGPT is saying and whether it is correct.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso as to Rh the terminology when you get into more specific blood groups gets specific which is why\u00a0\n\n\n> The terms Rh factor, Rh positive, and Rh negative refer to the Rh(D) antigen only.\n\n\nSo I thought you were thinking that Rh- and Rh+ blood are not able to donate in either direction. Instead of saying that Rh-nulls can donate to a person with any combination of Rh blood group antigens or lack therof. Though you'd still need to match in the ABO system at least. Theres also 43 other known blood groups beyond the ABO and Rhesus systems that could cause you issues.\u00a0",

His donations were part of every batch but his donations amount to only about 40,000 doses worth.

This is a protein on the surface of red blood cells that can be recognised by the immune system. If a mother that is Rh negative is carrying a baby that is Rh positive, you can have a serious issue called Rh disease. Basically, should the Rh positive blood of the mother manage to cross the placenta (this is not supposed to happen, but can under some conditions), the mother's immune system can activate to produce antibodies against the Rh antigen. As part of this, B memory cells are created which, upon additional exposure, will very quickly produce antibodies against the Rh antigen.\n\nThe problem is B memory cells are small enough to cross the placenta. So they transfer from the mother to the baby. Once in the babies bloodstream, they immediately recognise the Rh posited blood of the baby and cause an immune response to basically attack the entirety of the babies blood. Not good.\n\nSome people, such as James Harrison, have an u usually Hight number of Rh antibodies in their blood. This is useful because we have known for almost 100 years how to purify antibodies from blood plasma. So by taking people that have high amounts of Rh antigen antibodies, purifying the antibodies, and injecting them into Rh negative mothers, you can remove all of the Rh positive cells from the baby without ever activating the mother's immune system. No immune system activation means no B memory cells which means no Rhesus Disease.",
