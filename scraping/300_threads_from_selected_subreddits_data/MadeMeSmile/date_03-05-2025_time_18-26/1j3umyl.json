Also, they probably have fleas and stuff. At what point do you risk bathing them?\nDo you just like, treat the other cat/carpet for fleas and let them stink for a while? \n\nI thought about it for a few minutes, but didn't come up with any great solutions. Trying to bathe a cat that barely trusts you enough to let you touch them sounds like a very bad idea. At the same time, parasites are a thing. Also, what about vet visits? Do you immediately take them to a vet? Strays often have some medical issues/shots needed and stuff, right? \n\nI've never spontaneously adopted a cat this way before. I've thought about it, but I'm allergic to cats and have pretty severe asthma :/ reddits the only way I get to interact with them and still be able to breathe. I wish I could, but breathing is kind of non-negotiable",

The most effective ones I've found are the drops you put on the back of their necks. Many cats don't like that, but it's quick and easy to trick them with treats. You can also use flea combs to physically remove fleas, but that's harder if the cat doesn't trust you and it can be very time consuming and needs repeating frequently because more eggs hatch.\n\nImmediately taking them to a vet, or within the first week, is always a good idea. They can scan for microchips in case it's a cat who has a person but got lost. They'll also be able to do a checkup to make sure the cat is healthy, do any vaccines that might be needed, as well as sterilization. Sometimes strays will also have worms and the vet can figure that out and prescribe dewormer.",

I asked some neighbors and nobody knew her. Some said she's been around for a few weeks. It was October, it was raining, it was cold. I just had to help her. So I sat there with some kitten food and after a few hours she grabbed a bit, went back to the hedge, repeat. Then I drove back home, grabbed my cat box from my old cat with a towel and put it near the hedge and the food inside it. We tried to catch her but she always ran away. Then I put down my jacket and she just snuggled up in it. As she was distracted eating we just folded the jacket and stuffed her into the box. She did not resist or bite or hiss. The shelter couldn't find a chip and no one was missing a small cute cat. After she trusted us a few days later and didn't hide behind everything we took her to the vet, got her treated and now she is chilling with us and lives the life she deserves.",
