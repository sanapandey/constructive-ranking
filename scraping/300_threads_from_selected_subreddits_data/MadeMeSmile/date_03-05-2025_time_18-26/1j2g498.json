He would give us all the free stuff people sent him. Get us tickets for events. And, he is the most real dude. Such a great guy. \n\nHis life is crazy too. He can\u2019t even walk down the street to go to the bathroom without getting harassed. One women bust through our police lockup and actually kissed him one day! Haha he was clearly shocked but was actually so cool about it haha nothing fazes this guy.",

The hotel cleaned up the staff entrance and put up whole bunch of expensive freshly cut flowers daily.

Especially, she had some crazies that stalked her and she had to take legal action against them for her protection (restraining orders the stalker ignored and went to prison for, I think). Woman or man, it is scary to be stalked by a crazy person. \n\nIf there is an \u201cabnormal\u201d person in this story, it\u2019s Adam Sandler.
