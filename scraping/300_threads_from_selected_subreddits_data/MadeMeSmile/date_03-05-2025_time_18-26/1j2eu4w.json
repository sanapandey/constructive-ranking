So usually it's \"they are so nice\" or \"I always look forward to seeing them\" \"he always brightens my day.\"\n\nIt's a great way to give someone a boost without forcing a response/reaction. Works especially well with shy people :)",

They didn't react at all to that pep talk\n\nNow a year later I met her in the halls of our Uni and asked her how she was doing, she stopped and thanked me for the pep talk, she was on the edge of dropping out but what I said to her made her keep going. Now she is a respected scientist and I am fortunate to call her a friend.\n\nThat moment i made the decision that not a single day would go by without me giving a compliment or a pep talk to a student and over the years I've had a lot of people reach out to me to thank me for the kind words that helped them out.\n\nSo let that be a lesson, you don't need to do something big to save the world, you only need a few kind words of encouragement and empathy to make the world a little better one interaction at a time.",
