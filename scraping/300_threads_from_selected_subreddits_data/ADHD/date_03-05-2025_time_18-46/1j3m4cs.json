    "selftext": "I got diagnosed with ADHD 2 yrs ago and have since been on meds. The meds I use allow me to skip days meaning its not like some medication where you have to drink it daily to stay in a cycle. I skip during holidays/weekends that I do not have to study. (I'm currently in grade 12) \nI am good at maths while also being very artistic. I play piano and saxophone on an advanced level, I sketch and paint and I love to write. \nThe thing that bothers me is that I have wanted to become a neurosurgeon from the moment I knew what the brain was. However, I simply can't focus on anything scientific or mathematical without my meds. I understand the concepts just fine, but I just can't let it out. When I read interesting books (fiction/historical fiction/neurological) draw, play instrument, compose or write I focus withouthe need for meds.\nDuring quarantine I would draw for a day but when I had to do my  schoolwork I could not focus for 5 min\nThis is making me second guess my choice of field that I want to work in. If I need meds that strip me of my personality and my appetite just so I can focus for a few hours, is this field, even though I am so passionate about it really meant for me? I am so interested in the brain.\nIt feels like I have two opposing sides: one wants to stay on meds and study medicine without a personality and with an eating disorder and the other wants to do something artistic and study music or art, even when my lifelong dream has been to become a surgeon. I have never taken my artistic side as anything more serious than a hobby, so the idea of making it my job is quite frightening. I also hate the idea that I may never operate on a brain just because of my indecisiveness as a teen.\nIt is almost time to apply for universities and I have no direction.\nSorry if my English is not great, its not my home language.\n\n",
