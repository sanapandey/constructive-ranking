    "selftext": "I often multitask boring tasks with stimulating activities.\n\nFor a made up example I'm continuously switching between writing a big email, and playing a videogame. Then it makes me both die in the videogame and not finish the big email.\n\nSo I know that this multitasking isn't the answer. Then what will keep my brain from craving stimulation?\n\nOne suggestion I've read about is to have some background music but I'm not much of a music person.. as in, I can go days without it and I simply forget to put some in the background. It may work to keep my brain stimulated but how am I gonna make it work when I keep forgetting it?\n\nI also can't focus on 1 single thing for long, no matter what it is.\n\n",

            "body": "Understimulation is common in ADHD, my psychologist basically told me to take note of the symptoms of understimulation (which for me is mental and physical restlessness, among other things) and throughout a set period of time, notice what kinds of things may help, just by naturally coming across them. It may sound strange judging by what you said, but switching tasks actually does help a bit. I work in a lab, and if I'm writing something and I can't focus, I simply go to the lab and do an experiment. Then when I get tired from the lab I go back to my desk to write. Having a day job where you're able to switch between tasks or keep things novel throughout the day certainly is an advantage for people with ADHD I think. If not, even something as simple as getting coffee or water can make a difference to me. And when I do actually have to do some work NOW, it really is music for me (sorry), but if you're not into music you can try white/brown noise, ASMR, a youtube video, a podcast etc. If you forget those too... I'm out of ideas. meds lmao",

She could hook up a cheap MP3 player to some speakers to play all the time.",
