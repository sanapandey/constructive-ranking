    "selftext": "Stimulants are totally helpful and I am supportive of them as a person with ADHD who has benefitted them. However, for personal reasons I won\u2019t get into here, I am seriously considering going off them (Vyvanse, Adderall). I\u2019ve tried researching on this subreddit and Google but can\u2019t really find any information about this. The stuff that comes up caters to people who abuse stimulants who are getting off them. I\u2019m trying to find resources like books, podcasts, and coping skills that could help manage ADHD in lieu of medication. Would appreciate it if anyone has experience with this. Thanks!",

            "body": "The reason you won't find much about this topic is because there isn't much to it. You stop taking them, and you go back to your unmedicated raw ADHD; that's it.\n\nThere is no \"in lieu of medication\"; all the things you can do to manage your ADHD without meds are things that you probably want to do on medication as well, they're just more effective when combined with meds, and more important when off meds.\n\nWhat exactly those things are is pretty personal; what works for me might not work for you, and vv. You'll need to try a lot of stuff and see what sticks.\n\nGenerally speaking, things you could try would be:\n\n- Therapy, CBT (Cognitive Behavior Therapy) specifically. This is about learning to observe your emotions, thoughts, and behaviors, and how they affect one another, and finding ways of nudging them in a beneficial direction without burning yourself out in the process.\n- Managing stimulation. ADHD brains are prone to both over- and understimulation, so it's important to learn to tell the difference, and to have strategies for fixing either.\n- Practical accommodations. This can be others helping you in specific ways (e.g., body doubling, regular check-ins, giving you a heads up when they notice certain \"red flags\", reminding you of the time, etc.), but it can also be physical tools such as a pen-and-paper journal, big fat analog clocks in every room, labels on all drawers and boxes in your home, a system that makes laundry less horrible of a task, a whiteboard where you write down your schedule for the day, reminders on your phone, etc.\n- Taking care of your mind and body. Regular and sufficient sleep, fresh air, regular exercise, good food, self-care (whatever form works for you), meditation / mindfulness, a \"comfort corner\" in your home, etc.\n- Anticipating. Identify potential causes of overstimulation, \"bad brain days\", brain fog, brain fatigue, etc. - ultimately, the cause is of course ADHD, but there are also usually reasons why some days are worse than others, and if you can identify them, you can either avoid them, or at least prepare for the consequences. E.g., if I go on a multi-day business trip, then I know my brain will be useless for a couple days after, so I don't plan anything important then, keep a low profile, and make extra time for self care.\n\nIn terms of resource: I personally found \"How To ADHD\" (on YT) helpful. Lots of information and practical tips, presented in an accessible and ADHD-friendly way (people without ADHD might want to watch at 0.75x speed though), well researched overall, and doesn't require a PhD in neuropsychology to follow.",
