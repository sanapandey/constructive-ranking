    "selftext": "Day to day functioning is already quite difficult, and managing daily tasks takes so much of my capacity during my best times. I have been working on having better awareness of my menstrual cycle to observe and hopefully cater for myself during hormonal shifts, although having more awareness does feel like it's making anything easier right now.   \n  \nI have more understanding for myself as to why the housework has gone out of control again, why I stay in bed for hours doom scrolling when I wake up and why it feels so so difficult to do any productive tasks. The issue is that life doesn't follow my hormonal cycle and I have two and a half days to get the house sorted and myself sorted before going away.   \nI need to be using my time well right now, I need my meds to be working and I need to be doing at least SOMETHING productive, otherwise I will end up where I have been many times; on the verge of a breakdown or in a breakdown spiraling about everything and so stressed I probably take five years off my life in 24 hours. \n\nI wish I could have a friend over too body double or something, although I'm also grumpy, agitated and sore which does not make me feel like having anyone around. \n\nHow are we meant to manage this condition at the most stable of times, let alone when anything works during those times doesn't anymore because hormones say 'no'?\n\nI wish I could have consistency in life, a part from consistent cycles of being chaos and the using everything I have to create order, just to be in chaos again. I'm tired. ",
