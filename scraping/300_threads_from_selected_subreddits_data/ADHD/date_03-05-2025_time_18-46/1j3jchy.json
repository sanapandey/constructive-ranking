Even without my medication I struggle to eat between forgetting and sensory issues. For instance, weird about how things taste after the microwave but also cold chicken/meat really gross me out. \n\nAnything people love to eat/fixate on that I can try? Of course my days go better and I feel better when I eat but I often only have coffee and my meds and don\u2019t get to eat until 1-2 ish. \n\nThanks in advance! ",

Here\u2019s some veggie \u2018meals\u2019 that are all solidly caloric and have fiber to keep you full and regular. \n\nAvocado tortilla - take a large flour tortilla and smash/spread an avocado onto it (sprinkle salt & pepp if you want) and roll it up. You could throw in some sliced cheese if you want. \n\nPeanut butter toast/sandwich. Jelly is gross to me, but crunchy peanut butter on wheat bread is highly nutritious and can also be eaten handheld, quickly. \n\nFruit & nuts. I love apples and PB, but that requires slicing, dipping, plates etc. So, whole apple and a handful of pistachios. Banana and walnuts. Etc etc.",
