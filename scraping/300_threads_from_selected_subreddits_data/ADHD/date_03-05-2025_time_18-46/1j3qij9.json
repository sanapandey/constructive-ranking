Turns out trauma can damage the hippocampus which plays a role in ADHD and which is also responsible for spatial relations. I\u2019ve always wondered why I;\n\nPut my clothes on backwards and/or inside out\n\nHave a hard time with Tetris\n\nCan\u2019t be trusted with a thing in both hands cuz the wrong one will end up in the trash (see my post about gravy in my purse as an example)\n\nPress the button on the right when I was aiming for the left\n\nAm I alone here? I\u2019m so curious about how common this is but my sample size of 1 isn\u2019t super helpful. Just wondering if any of you have this issue.",

As another commenter pointed out we still don\u2019t have a complete picture about these complex relationships and my idea is half-baked at best. I\u2019m mostly interested in anecdotal information. The post isn\u2019t getting much traction though so maybe I have my answer. I\u2019m a weirdo.",

So if this is becoming well known are they starting to look into children with adhd to make sure no trauma/abuse? I imagine it isn\u2019t 100% that way as I know some very adhd kids and I also know that they weren\u2019t abused.",
