    "selftext": "So I took the bar exam and went to get my nails done as a treat! Instead I can think of nothing except my awful nails and I\u2019m crazy hyperfixated on how bad they are! My ADHD brain cannot stop obsessing over how sad I am and how bad they are. \n\nI got my very first set of acrylics done a few weeks back and I was so excited to get my first fill and get them painted! \n\nI tried a different nail tech because although the girl I went to before did a good job, she didn\u2019t listen to what I wanted, she was 30 mins late to our appointment and very hard to get ahold of so I found a new place to go! \n\nBad decision on my part! The girl I went to told me halfway through that she was brand new and had no idea what she was doing! She cut me multiple times so I was bleeding everywhere, she trapped literal human hair inside my acrylics, the paint was runny, and the acrylics are all so bumpy and my nails are all different shapes and sizes. She looked at them, apologized for how bad they were AND THEN CHARGED ME ANYWAYS LOL, AND I TIPPED $20 Because she was nice and told me about how she lost 3/4 of her kids in a custody battle! \n\nI scheduled another appointment with a new tech on Friday! \n\nI wish I could attach pics! Check my page for pics if I can\u2019t post any in comments \ud83d\ude2d\n\nTo a non ADHD person this may seem like a small problem, but I literally am in the midst of a post bar exam mental breakdown and the bad nails are pushing me over the edge.

I once got my lashes done in my year abroad in america (I didn\u2018t know that I went to someone who was way too cheap to be good bc I just assumed europe prices) and they just glued like falsies on my lashes (permanent glue tho!!) and I was so embarassed but also tipped 20 usd bc I didn\u2018t know any betterrr!! \n\nMaybe that makes you feel better haha because you\u2018re sure as hell not alone!! \n\nAnd then I fixated on my lashes so much after that I really get it omg it\u2018s normal to feel like that!",
