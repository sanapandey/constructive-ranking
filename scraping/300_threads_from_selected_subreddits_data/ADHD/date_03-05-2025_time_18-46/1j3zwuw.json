    "selftext": "So I've been prescribed generic Adderall IR and finally found the perfect dose around December last year, the effects have been incredible or close to it, its awesome. So why am I so inconsistent on taking it daily? It truly baffles me, it does kinda affect me at night when trying to sleep, I feel like I still want to be productive even after the effectiveness wears off, like I don't know how to turn the power switch off if that makes sense? Gonna talk with my psychiatrist about it, might try Vyvanse and see how that goes. I think my biggest problem is that I sometimes forget to take it the next day almost always after taking Adderall the day before, its like my mind subconsciously doesn't want to take it. I take my blood pressure meds every night with no problem so its been a little confusing, maybe its because I'm kinda unemployed and don't have a set schedule perhaps. So my question is how do you guys stay consistent on taking your meds when you wake up? Maybe I need to place it in the bathroom next to my toothbrush so I take it after brushing perhaps or maybe an alarm? How do you guys stay consistent? Thank you.",

            "body": "I'm waiting for psych assessment so I'm not on ADHD meds yet but I've been on antidepressants for about 15 years and in that time I have **not** managed to go one full week without missing at least one dose. Often i miss 2 days and when I do I get these awful electric brain zaps until my levels climb again \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab if I miss three days or more my RSD comes back with a roar \ud83d\ude28 Yes I regularly miss 3 days. 15 years is not long enough for me to build this one habit \ud83e\udd2c\n\nThe struggle is real. \n\nSometimes I genuinely forget, sometimes I just have this resistance to taking them, \"I'll do it in a minute\" even though I KNOW how unpleasant the side effects are. \n\nThe best thing I have found for me is actually three things lol. I keep my meds next to the kettle because i love a cup of tea in the morning. I also set a reminder on my phone, AND I carry a daily dose in my bag in case I leave the house without taking them. Even with that I STILL miss doses because I go out without my handbag or forget to refill the handbag stash \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24 \n\nIt sucks. I'm no help to you!",

ADHD meds have actually helped a lot in that regard, I'm more talkative and positive when I'm on Adderall so hopefully you'll reap the same benefits fingers crossed, good luck on the entire ADHD diagnosed process, took me a year to find a great psychiatrist that knows ADHD and understands our pain, don't get discouraged if you find a rotten psychiatrist, eventually you'll find someone that fits.  Back to meds, I just wish there was a 24 hour pill we could take or a monthly shot, would be so helpful for forgetful people like us lmao. Would be a godsend.\n\nAnd oh shit, carrying a backup in the car is a genius idea! Will definitely implement that right away. That was in fact actually the opposite, very helpful! Thank you for the tips!!",

            "body": "Im taking elvanse. I am also unemployed, and consistency with a schedule and specially pills are pretty hard for me. I always hated taking meds and also im not a morning person either. \n\nBut this what best work for me. set 2 alarms at 7:30 and 8 am. \nIf im able to get up i\u2019ll have breakfast and then have the pill. If im feeling lazy and im not up by 8 then i take the pill and go back to sleep. The pill will wake me up either way in few hrs anyways.\n\nFor the pills i find it better to start it earlier so that by the end of the day it wears off a bit. If i miss a day or more i start it even earlier than what i usually do. (e.g. take it at 6 am then back to sleep.)\nAs for the productivity and the switch off, its hard to do so when im not consistent with the meds because they tend to keep you going. When i miss some days and then try to retake it, i have the same side effects from taking it the first time. \nHighly alert, speed talking, hyper focused and loss of appetite. Always want to do something. And might not sleep for 24 hrs even and feel like I wanna sprint clean the apartment 4 times\ud83d\ude02! \nI find these symptoms get less as i get more consistent with the meds, and the switch off gets easier. \n\nPutting a bit of a wake up and shutdown down time helps as well. I try to get in my sleeping groove around 10 pm. \nI find it easier for me to go to sleep with no phone and only an audio. Cause my brain is craving to focus on something, doom scrolling is a real thing!!! If i use my phone in bed thats it bbye sleep \ud83d\ude02. i instead tend to put on one of my comfort shows that ive been over billion times lol. And i would do it on my laptop not tv, and turn the brightness down and the voice not so high. This way im not really interested in watching it cause i know what happens but its nice to have something to keep ur mind from running marathons. \n\nOn a side note: \nI cant deal with using the calendar or reminders app to help me with doing things. If anything i\u2019ll have that notification for days. \nBut what i realised i like and work best for me was use the notes on my phone to make a list of things I want to do during the day. Something as simple as (pills, brush teeth, mop, breakfast, eat snack, dishes\u2026 etc.) Those little chores dont change i like to put a little \u2705 when im done, that brings me little satisfaction haha. And then as the day goes i just tick away my chores and by night i re set it again by only removing the ticks. \nI Keep in mind and remind myself, i dont have to do anything in order or urgently either. except taking the pill on time\u261d\ud83c\udffbcause that will mess up food and sleep. So that way its less stressful on my little tiny hard working brain \ud83d\ude02\n\nKeep reminding yourself of how amazing and productive you feel on them during the day! Tell who ever u can tell how amazing and different you feel tooo. Verbalising those thoughts and thinking it, also helps u to look forward for ur meds. And for adhd thats the thing. (Our brain craves and remembers those little joys)\n\nI feel like i might have over explained a bit, hope it helps. sorry lol.",

I forgot to mention the loss of appetite that I suffer from like you, though I feel like its a positive since I wanna lose a ton of weight. I might try the alarm or making it a daily Google Task notification, I use that and Google Calendar for every appointment or thing I need to do with multiple reminders days and hours before the task/event, its changed my life over the past year. I have an Android phone/tablet so I make it the calendar and tasks widget a full page which has been beneficial for me. Just the waking up and taking it before I go somewhere I'm always forgetful. But ya, once again thanks for the tips!",
