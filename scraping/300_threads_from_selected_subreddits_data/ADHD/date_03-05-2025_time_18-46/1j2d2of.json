I am medicated, methylphenidate hydrochloride 54 mg prolonged release.\n\nFor the past 2 weeks, I have experienced the worst executive dysfunction in more than a year.\n\nThe way that I experience rejection sensitivity is also extremely high currently.\n\nI am not here for a solution, because I don't think there is one.\n\nDespite me feeling really embarrassed by this, I think I just need a bit of understanding and sympathy.",

So if I can do it, SO CAN YOU. \n\nRelax. Take a deep breath. Get a good nights rest, and start over tomorrow. And for fucks sake, put down that coffee and drink some water, I know you\u2019re dehydrated. And when you walk by those haters, make sure you have your hand on your nuts and make eye contact. Fuck em. \n\n(That\u2019s how I self talk when I feel this way. For real tho, I hope you pull it together and do what needs to be done)",

            "body": "Please be aware that RSD, or rejection sensitivity dysphoria, is not a syndrome or disorder recognised by any medical authority. \n\nRejection sensitivity dysphoria has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research, nor is it listed in the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or the ICD. It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD. Dodson's explanation of these experiences and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.\n\nHere are some scientific articles on ADHD and rejection:\n\n* [Rejection sensitivity and disruption of attention by social threat cues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771869/)\n* [Justice and rejection sensitivity in children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/)\n* [Rejection sensitivity and social outcomes of young adult men with ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242422/)\n\nAlthough r/ADHD's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven hypotheses), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and we have **not** removed this post. We do not want to minimise or downplay your feelings, and many people use RSD as a shorthand for this shared experience of struggling with emotions. \n\nHowever, please consider using the terms 'rejection sensitivity' and 'emotional dysregulation' instead.\n\n^(*A moderator has not removed your submission; this is not a punitive action.
