And in turn this has led to A LOT of impulsive decisions. \n\nSubstance Abuse, failed relationships, and just an overall sense of misery. I thought I could walk the straight and narrow on willpower alone, but I have never been more wrong\u2026\n\nDoes anyone else understand what it\u2019s like and have any experience or wisdom they would like to share? Especially when it pertains to relationships/marriage\u2026",

I just started concerta and it's really helped me regulate my mood and now I have a better chance of noticing my emotions before I get too impulsive. I also go to therapy and I'm on other meds but actually medicating my ADHD has been a game changer",
