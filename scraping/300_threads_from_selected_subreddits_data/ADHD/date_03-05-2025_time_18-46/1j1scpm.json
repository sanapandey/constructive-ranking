I\u2019m doing a little bit of things, but I feel so overwhelmed. I feel like every time I clean something it gets messed up again. And not by my children just by us living our lives. Please send me motivation.",

Don\u2019t allow them to be a factor in your motivation at all. Instead, silence your mind and focus on the physical aspect of accomplishing things. (Get up, walk over to the sink, turn on the faucet, rinse the plate, scrub the plate, rinse the plate again) after about 3 minutes of doing this, your mind will submit and accept that you\u2019ve made an executive decision (it\u2019s time to clean!).",

I know how frustrating and crushing it is, when it just isn't working, because then it feels like nothing is working and everything is falling apart. It's okay though, as hard as it is to accept, it's okay. What's the bare minimum for today? Today is going to be a bare minimum day. \n\nYou're still going to have ups and downs, better and worse days. Think of today as a rest day. Guarantee you won't be getting that much rest, lol, but please don't beat yourself up when you just aren't able to be 100%. These are the days you need your own sympathy the most. It's somehow so natural to treat ourselves the opposite way instead. You did great, and you're still doing good. Give it a good shot, and try to dwell on how wonderful it is that you can have days like yesterday again.",

Recognize that there are days when I have zero motivation to do anything that's not \"fun.\"\n2. Break up the cleaning into chunks, and after each \"chunk\" is done I get to sit down and play on the computer or do the NYT crossword or something. It makes the task less monolithic.\n3. Give yourself some grace about having zero-motivation days. It happens.",
