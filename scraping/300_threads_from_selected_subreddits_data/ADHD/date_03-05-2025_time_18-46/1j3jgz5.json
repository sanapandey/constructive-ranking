    "selftext": "Has anyone else been falsely diagnosed with ADHD? I was \"diagnosed\" when I was a child as I had to seek help because of a very traumatic childhood. I stopped taking medication in 8th grade after having knee surgery. That is also when I was no longer seeing the parent that has been abusing me (both were abusing but one was worse than the other). Then all my ADHD behaviors stopped. I had another eval with a psychiatrist today and he told me I don't meet the criteria to have ADHD. This is a shock to me but I had a feeling I was misdiagnosed. My psychiatrist said he believes that the trauma brought out these crazy behaviors that looked like ADHD behaviors. Now that I am navigating without having this label, I was wondering if anyone else has been falsely diagnosed as well. ",

Thankfully trauma can be healed and worked through, but ADHD is lifelong. I kind of doubt you will find many people on this sub relating to misdiagnosis but who knows? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

            "body": "Since a psychiatrist agrees you\u2019re potentially misdiagnosed, could you leverage that to have the label removed from your medical record? \nIf this is very important to you, the main thing would be finding out which records include that diagnosis, requesting the keepers of those records update/correct them, and providing maybe a letter from psychiatrist in support?\n\nI\u2019ve often thought about this because I have misdiagnoses on my record from before I was correctly diagnosed with adhd that influence how caregivers perceive me. But haven\u2019t done anything because truly it\u2019s a pain and probably almost impossible to do completely. \n\nWhat\u2019s the outcome you\u2019re after?",
