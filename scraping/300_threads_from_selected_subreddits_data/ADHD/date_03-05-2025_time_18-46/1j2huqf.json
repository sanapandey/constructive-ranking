    "selftext": "As the title says and just needed to vent to a community that understands\u2026 just been in a meeting with my boss who said why can\u2019t you just use a pen and write. Everyone knows I have it. I said I needed the laptop; got told it\u2019s distracting for him, I don\u2019t listen, miss things and don\u2019t make eye contact because I\u2019m typing. I said I am listening I am trying to get all the info down because I won\u2019t be able to remember it or the detail of the task set. Sighing at the fact I don\u2019t use pen and paper. I then tried in that meeting but left it without retaining any information and feeling myself stuck on the task set. I felt lost. Got pulled into a second meeting them trying to do damage control. \n",

Automatic Transcription functions have gotten really good lately so you could likely leave the meetings with a decent AI-generated script of everything that was said.",

He then said a few things trying to smooth over the situation but i think from a HR point of view. Gutting really as I often believe it can be a positive thing as I am able to zone into my \u2018bubble\u2019 as I call it in the office when I am interested in the task and not move for 3 hours. You know how it is!",

It feels depressing. People just treat you like you are an idiot\u2026and I feel like one too. :(",
