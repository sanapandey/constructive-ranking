    "selftext": "Trying to go to bed. Laying with my eyes closed for I don't even know how long. And there's this small ticking noise coming from the window on my side of the bed. Not regular just every 30 seconds to a minute. No matter how hard I try to ignore my brain is just zoning in on this noise and not allowing me to sleep. So at this point it's driving me crazy. I finally get up to try to figure it out. These windows are really old, there's like inside panes and outside panes. Usually you lift a window up, well not sure if this one's broken but the top has actually very slowly been sliding down letting in a pretty nice draft. We have curtains over this area so I'm not sure how long it hasn't been fully closed. We didn't notice because there's still the outside pane so we haven't been getting rain or snow inside just been letting lots of cold in and lots of hot out. But now I know to check it and hopefully we can save on gas now that we don't have a window open in winter. \n\nEditing to add- I was able to slide the windows back up and the noise seems to have stopped so hopefully I can sleep now.
