They are l also insisting I try generic before switching to branded because of my insurance (I guess). \n\nI have 2 questions for the group (specifically those who were diagnosed in their 30s or later);\n\nHow has your life changed since getting diagnosed and starting medication ? \n\nFor those who are starting meds for the first time (branded)  how are your prescribers getting around you trying generic before branded?
