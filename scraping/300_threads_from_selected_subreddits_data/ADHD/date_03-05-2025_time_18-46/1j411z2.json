    "selftext": "Hi! \nI recently started testing out medication after being diagnosed with ADD almost 3 years ago. (I haven\u2019t been able to start sooner since I have been a little underweight.) Anyways\n\nI started first with Ritalin, and that went pretty bad, then I switched to Elvanse 20mg and the first two days I struggled to sleep and my appetite was bad, and I also crashed badly in the evening where I felt like a zombie. Then everything got better and I felt so much good effect on my add symptoms including my anxiety and depression. It felt so good! \nI went on the same dose for a week, and then I started to get agitated and depressed in the evenings. I usually took the medication at 0830, and I got the depressed and irritated feeling around 16 -17 and it lasted until 18 - 19 in the evening. (Sometimes later too)\nThe weird thing is, is that I also felt very alone and isolated myself from friends and my partner, my \u201cbehavior\u201d kind of changed.\n\nI think this is super sad, since the medication barely gave me any other side effects except from the drops in the evening. Does anyone have the same or similar experience? \n\nWould it maybe help to take two doses instead of one? Im going to my psychiatrist tomorrow btw. ",
