    "selftext": "I have not smoked for about 2 months. I sometimes drink redbull but because I like the taste, I have not taken any preworkout for over a month. I went from taking around 400 mg of caffeine a day to around 200 mg a WEEK. I've been smoking for the past 3 years, although it was just the last year were I did it regularly. I've been on Adderall XR 20mg in the morning and IR 10 mg in the early afternoon. I didn't stop my nic or caffeine consumption for any health concerns, I just don't feel anymore the need of caffeine to hit the gym or the need of nicotine when I'm studying for a test. It's definitely a good thing, though I have had some appetite suppression which is a problem to build up muscle. I've always had problems with taking \"weight gain\" calories and it has been harder recently. Just thought it was interesting and wanted to know if someone went through something similar. It's a double edged sword, but I've definitely had more benefits than problems with my treatment.",

            "body": "It's super common for us to learn to self medicate with caffeine when we haven't been provided with the proper medication. Caffeine is a poor substitute, but it is a stimulant. So is nicotine. Once we get on the proper medication it's common for the need for caffeine to go away.\n\nFor me I don't like to have caffeine when I'm medicated because it makes me feel too jittery.\n\nI have the same issues with appetite. I find that I'm much more willing to drink my calories when I'm medicated than eat solid foods.",
