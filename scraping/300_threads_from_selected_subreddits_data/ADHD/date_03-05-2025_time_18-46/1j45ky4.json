    "selftext": "Hello! I am a 19 year old female with ADHD and Twice Exceptionality (2e). To preface, I have been medicated for nearly 2 years now. Fall of 2024, I attended college for the first time as a psychology major. I left after four weeks. The material wasn't challenging, so I got unfocused-- only to have no clue what was going on in class soon after. On top of that, there were no arts offered, which I needed to feel sane. I came home, waited until the next semester and then attended a different university as a film major (Bachelor's of Science). I thought deciding to full send into an artistic major I'm passionate about would help, but since it was a bachelor's of science I got unfocused with the general education classes and dropped out again.\n\nI've toured a few art schools, because at this point doing a BFA sounds even more appealing, but I worry I'll just be left to suffer in silence until I drop out, or that I'll be miserable. I want a degree, I don't care what it is, but it's important to me that I get one. Disability resources at these places have been nice, yet at the end of the day if I'm not interested in doing something, I can't bring myself to do it. If the class has to do with drawing, filmmaking, anything artsy, I'm all over it. But the second I have to take a math class, I'm out. I try my hardest to attend and keep up with the work, but it brings me genuine despair and depression when I am forced to go. I'd rather not wake up every day hating my life while I'm 19.\n\nI've researched colleges specifically catered toward students like this... and they don't really exist. I thrive with 1 on 1 learning, but colleges don't have that unless it's a specific program ON TOP of existing classes-- that's too much for me. I am able to go anywhere in the world, and I'm willing to try out different things! If anyone has any suggestions or any advice please share!!\n\nSummary: I ",
