    "selftext": "Just putting a quick story of mine out there for anyone who has been struggling with being tired all the time, falling asleep, or crashing multiple times throughout the day. Hopefully this helps someone.\n\nTry getting rid of caffeine!\n\nI know this is a somewhat known thing with adhd and stimulants/depressants having an opposite effect, but this never even crossed my mind until the other day. I had done research into cortisol issues, and adenosine came up. Come to find a link between adenosine and adhd, which happens to be the opposite of caffeine: and voila. I thought maybe since everything affects me backwards I should try the opposite of caffeine or just get rid of it altogether.\n\n I've been chronically exhausted for almost a year now, tried so many different supplements, Dietary changes, exercising, wondering what's wrong and thinking maybe I need to get a blood panel done.\nI've kept cramming the caffeine in hopes it wakes me up but just feel ready to fall asleep off and on throughout the day.\n\n (Come to think, the off and on may be each individual caffeinated drink hitting me.)\n\nAlso, if you have troubles sleeping, come to find out adhders are often affected most by caffeine at the END of the day.\n\nToday I tried something different: foregoing the caffeine, and I feel 10\u00d7 better even on 6 hrs of sleep. Wow.\nWho knew it wasn't ever something I was lacking but something I need to get rid of.\n",
