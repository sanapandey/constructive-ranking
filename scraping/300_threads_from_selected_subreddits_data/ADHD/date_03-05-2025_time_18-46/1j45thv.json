Its all direct project based, and when I looked at NLP and recommender system, I felt like running, the lines of code scared the crap out of me, I just completed the videos for the sake of getting a certificate. Can someone tell me how to tackle this fear of  huge codes or new things?",

            "body": "yep! even 100 lines of code or so quickly become frustrating for me, especially if it's code written.. idk, properly I guess?\n\nBecause clear, readable, sensible code is B O R I N G.\n\nanyways: go slowly. I know it is frustrating, but it is _more_ frustrating when you are just guessing answers, clicking checkboxes and building knowledge debt. You could get to a point where you can't go further but also won't want to backtrack and return where you were months ago.\n\nIf what you know is too boring and what you don't know is too hard... leave the code aside and use your focus to understand the concepts you are using. Usually the courses will do something like \"we're now using tf-idf to do x\" but they will teach you how to use the tool rather than what the tool really is, does or why we are using it. And to me that's frustrating and I just give up because all I see are tens of lines of code that mean nothing.",
