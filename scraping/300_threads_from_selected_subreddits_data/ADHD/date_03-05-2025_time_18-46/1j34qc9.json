    "selftext": "I\u2019m in my mid-20s and was just diagnosed with ADHD yesterday. I\u2019ll start medication next week, but my biggest challenges are regulating my emotions, managing impulsive decisions and speech, and dealing with intense sugar cravings to stay alert.\n\nI\u2019m currently going through the no-contact phase of a breakup, and I\u2019ve always struggled with relationships\u2014never having a long-term one. I used to think I just wasn\u2019t meant for them, but my clinician said this can be common with ADHD and that medication might help with impulsivity, emotional regulation, and even the sugar cravings.\n\nFor those who have been on ADHD medication, did it help with these issues? And for anyone with ADHD (with or without meds), how do you cope with breakups, intense emotions, and impulsive thoughts?\n\nI\u2019ve been struggling emotionally and mentally, and it\u2019s taking a toll on my anxiety and overall health. It\u2019s been three months since the breakup, but I feel hyperfocused on this person, and maintaining no contact has been really hard. Any advice would be greatly appreciated (I did use ChatGPT to make what I wrote more clear as I didn\u2019t know how to order what I wanted to say to make it concise and not weird so sorry if it sounds robotic or weird)",
