Going to take it at night as he said it can make you drowsy but also said it can have the opposite effect and make me more alert so if that happens take it with my adderall.\n\nWhat are your experiences and side effects you noticed? Did you feel like you noticed a positive change from just your stimulant? I\u2019m 24m.",
