    "selftext": "Hey everyone. Wanted to get others\u2019 experiences with using atomoxetine. \n\nI\u2019ve been using it for 2 months now, and having absolutely no luck with it. Going through all the usual side effects that I saw on here - especially nausea. \n\nCurrently taking 60mg, and apart from nausea, it\u2019s having absolutely no affect on me.\n\nMy q\u2019s are - how long before I sack it off? My prescribing nurse keeps saying \u2018are you sure you want to persist?\u2019 because I keep thinking one day it\u2019s going to get better. Should I give it another week, month? Also, do I need to go up to 80mg maybe to see a difference? And What does it feel like when it \u2018works\u2019?\n\nI also tried methylphenidate XR and Elvanse, and didn\u2019t like either of those, so after this I\u2019ve got nothing else\u2026\n\nAll advice/experiences/empathy are welcome!",

After trying a few stimulants and feeling like they made things worse I decided to try Straterra again. I\u2019m on 80mg daily and I notice a huge difference. Not saying that this is your case but I do find it helped after I took a few weeks to feel different and the side effects to balance out.",

Now at 80mg I can focus 7/10 on a good day, and I feel like I\u2019m more alert during the day. I do need to talk to psych to see about adding a stimulant to help with the focus.",
