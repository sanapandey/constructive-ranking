    "selftext": "As the title states. I took my first dose 2 hours ago. Currently on 10mg xr adderall. I was recently diagnosed at 33 years old. I've really struggled on and off with obsessive/intrusive thoughts lately and multiple doctors have came to the conclusion that it's untreated adhd causing me to hyper focus on the thoughts. I have tons of other symptoms such as feeling overwhelmed by tasks I don't want to do, not knowing where to start if I find a task difficult or time consuming, poor organization, constant mind racing, severe memory issues (appointments, chores, etc). I'll bounce around from task to task without completing any of them because I get side tracked, zoning out during conversations and not hearing anything a person says, yet still being able to hold the conversation, etc.I feel like I flew under the radar because I hyperfocus when testing and always performed well academically. \n\nHere's the kicker. I'm a recovering addict and have been sober from all mind altering substances for the most part of 13 years (2 short slip ups in the past). FWIW, stimulants were never something I experimented with. I've been very cautious about starting adderall but my mental health has been in such  decline I've become desperate. All doctors are aware of my past and I've ran it by my sponsor who agreed I should consider trying it. \n\nMy question is this. I took my first dose 2 hours ago. I do feel \"stimulated\" and more talkative. My body is a little tingly. I feel slightly jittery, yet somehow relaxed at the same time. However, my mind feels relaxed. The constant thoughts and obsessions are near completely quiet. I feel like mentally, my brain is having a break. But physically I'm \"ready to go.\" I just want to make sure this is something to be expected from someone who genuinely needs this medication. ",

How long till it takes before you need mindless stimulation. For me it's like scrolling reddit. Make sure you can sleep. Make sure you eat protein, drink water because the desire to will go away. Mornings will always be better. You may crash earlier in the afternoon before the advertised duration, that can be a sign you need a higher dose. If you're lucky the crash happens at night closer to bed time. For me there's always a little bit left over. Brushing my teeth in the morning before meds is a little less painful. I'm on vyvanse and it has an elimination period of 2.5 days. In a few days the blood levels will reach peak.",

Think of taking your new medication this way - your mind is actually what is altered, and what you are taking is helping you realign your brain back to the standard. \n\nA lot of undiagnosed people turn to other substances to try and help with whats going on with them mentally, and I am happy that you have some answers even if it is later in life. This is not a gateway to anything - it is a tool to help you be the best version of yourself that you can be! \n\nIf you don't know what to do with some of the new energy you have - try working out, or running, or just going for a walk with some music. Use that energy to make changes you have wanted to do, but didn't have the capacity to start/hold yourself to. \n\nYou got this stranger!",

I started feeling super relaxed and calm about 1.5 hours after my first dose, and my comorbid anxiety completely evaporated. I was surprised to find that after taking amphetamines for the first time, I felt like taking a nap. I\u2019d never recreationally experimented with stimulants either, always found that idea a bit terrifying. \n\nI didn\u2019t feel the tingly body stuff but for a few days I did feel some mild euphoria, that soon passed. Definitely stay hydrated and be careful with coffee, in my experience Adderall and full caff coffee didn\u2019t mix too well. \n\nI don\u2019t have addiction issues myself but in the past I\u2019ve certainly thrown back a drink or three, yet since I\u2019ve started Adderall I\u2019ve found my taste for booze has diminished considerably. I suspect you might find getting on these meds might equalize that part of your brain and mitigate your impulse to use (keep an eye on that, obviously). I certainly don\u2019t have any desire to abuse my Adderall. It\u2019s absolutely miraculous stuff, I hope it changes your life the way it\u2019s changed mine.",
