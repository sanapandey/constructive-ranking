    "selftext": "[22M]\n\nThroughout my life as I look back there have been many moments where I have found myself with bad habits, not exercising, eating unhealthy, drug abuse, laziness, untidiness. \n\nI also have many moments where I am the opposite, exercising everyday, eating healthy, not drinking much, no drugs, active and tidy. I seem to burn myself out by being so good and a light turns off I am so bad. Like I hyperfocus on being super healthy and then nothing.\n\nI have subconsciously attached these bad habits forming when I am comfortable in a job or where I live, and good habits forming when I have a major life change (which has been every year or so). For example, new job, new house etc. \n\nI really want to be able to just maintain a consistent decently healthy lifestyle without joining 10 clubs, working out 20 times a week and eating like a pilates mum, then burning out and train-wrecking badly. Then having to switch something major in my life to go back to being healthy. What happens when I have a job for 5 years in the same house? Do I stay train-wrecked?\n\nI\u2019m looking for anyone in a similar situation or any advice that might be able to help? I\u2019m assuming this is linked to my ADHD but some clarification on this might be good too?",

            "body": "I feel like I have been doing this for most of my adult life. I get way focused on something, do lots of planning and have like really detailed routines, stick to them for a while until I feel like I am losing the energy and burning out. Then at one point I just stop doing it. It also usually happens after a bigger change in life or when I hit a bottom and sort of reset stuff, I guess my brain resets itself or something and that feel like a clean slate and new energy to do stuff. I haven't found a solution yet, but I try to think of the following stuff.\n\nI think two things that help here are just limiting yourself instead of going all in. Set a minimum goal of exercising and cleaning per week for example. Limit your drinking and other stuff to 1-3 days per week only. Try to keep this going for a while so you have enough downtime if you have a busier week for example. After a few months see if you can exercise more and drink less. Just keep adding incrementally, but give yourself some rest weeks/days if you are not feeling it. \n\nIf you lose your energy, just remember that even though you have done less recently, this doesn't mean that you should just quit the entire thing, just make yourself do less for a while, but still do something minimum. Maybe also try switching things up, if you don't feel like exercising just go for a walk at least. Stay active mentally if not physically. I often just get bored of things cause my brain just hates routine and craves perfection I think.",
