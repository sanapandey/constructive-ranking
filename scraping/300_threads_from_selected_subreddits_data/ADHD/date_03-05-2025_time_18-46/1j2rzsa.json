    "selftext": "Received my diagnosis last May after years of wondering why something wasn\u2019t \u201cright.\u201d Now I\u2019m on the journey of figuring out how to actually live with my ADHD. I\u2019m still struggling with the boring tasks like personal hygiene; but the one bugging me most right now is eating. \n\nFor my whole life I\u2019ve had a standard breakfast routine: eat something for a few weeks, get tired of it, switch to something else, and repeat the cycle. Lunch is kinda like the Wild West though, there\u2019s no routine and it drives me insane. I go to community college right now which means no dining hall. Any tips or tricks to make eating (let alone healthy eating) less of a chore??",

            "body": "I love cooking and I\u2019d say improving my skills has helped me eat better and more affordably. Starting with whole ingredients is probably the healthiest choice, even if it\u2019s a relatively indulgent meal like a pasta. Learn to make a good sauce, and try making curry as spices have a lot of nutrients and beneficial compounds. \n\nPotatoes, whole grains, buckwheat, hummus are all healthy carbs. Look up a recipe for tabbouleh. \n\nExtra virgin olive oil is probably the healthiest fat. \n\nNow while I cook fairly well and healthy, my main issue is snacking. I am a bottomless pit when it comes to sugar. I don\u2019t struggle with weight or exercise but I make up all the calories I don\u2019t cook with sweets. Chocolate and biscuits especially. It affects my skin, my sleep, and probably makes me quite tired. I\u2019m talking 200g minimum every day. \n\nHonestly, snacking on dry roasted peanuts helps a lot.",
