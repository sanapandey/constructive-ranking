    "selftext": "I've recently found that counting slowly up to 100 missippi, and then counting back down to 0 really helps me calm down.\n\nI first started out doing it with my eyes closed with some white noise on, with the goal of being able to do it while attending to my daily activities. \n\nPretty good so far, did it again today while doing trash/recycling just completely focused on the count. Now I'm super chill writing this post.\n\nI've upped the stakes going forward now:\n- Do the initial count as mentioned\n- Have a running count starting from 500 working my way down to zero to hopefully work on some memory, and chip away at it during the day.\n\nTo remember the count, using a simple mind palace trick, and visualizing the number in huge font in my bedroom.\n\nTrying to hack the crazy \ud83e\udde0!",
