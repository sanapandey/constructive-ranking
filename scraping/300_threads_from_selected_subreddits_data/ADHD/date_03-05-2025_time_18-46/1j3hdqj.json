    "selftext": "I\u2019m 34 years old, female, and was recently diagnosed with adult ADHD (primarily impulsivity- and inattentiveness-driven). For as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve dealt with generalized anxiety and mood swings, and I always thought this was just part of who I was.\n\nHowever, after starting Ritalin, I noticed something completely unexpected: my anxiety almost disappeared. But whenever I stop taking it or take a break, my anxiety slowly creeps back within a few days. This made me wonder\u2014was my anxiety actually a symptom of untreated ADHD all along?\n\nAt the same time, I\u2019ve noticed that Ritalin doesn\u2019t work consistently every day. Some days, it works incredibly well\u2014I feel focused, balanced, and calm. Other days, however, it feels like it does almost nothing. This inconsistency is frustrating because I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s affecting it. Could it be factors like diet, sleep, stress, or hormonal cycles?\n\nSo, I wanted to ask:\n\t\nHas anyone else experienced reduced anxiety from Ritalin? If so, do you think it\u2019s a direct effect, or could it be placebo?\n\nHow do you deal with ADHD medication working inconsistently? Are there any factors that improve or worsen its effects?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear how others handle this. What has worked for you? Any insights would be greatly appreciated!",
