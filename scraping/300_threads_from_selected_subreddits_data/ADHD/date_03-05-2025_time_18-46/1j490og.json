It would have been obsolete by now anyways, so I am open to any/all suggestions, but I am trying to avoid vocals because words are, for me , very distracting when trying to write. I'm open to just color noise as well.\n\nI am trying to finish a long, detailed and highly specific document and I literally cannot stop my mind from interrupting itself. Please. Haaaaaalp!",
