My entire life everyone's just called me careless, forgetful, and have been told almost on a daily basis that I can't do anything right. I finally mustered up the courage go to the gym today after working out at home for 3 months, and I ended up losing my phone. I feel so silly and stupid, I don't even want to go back. I went back and checked but my phone wasn't there, its going straight to voicemail, and its not showing up when I look at its location. I know its gone, and I know its my fault, I just don't know how to stop being so careless. I just feel so silly. ",

That\u2019s how it is for me too like bro I already know I\u2019m those things but I can\u2019t f***ing help it! Recently I cut off one of those people who did it the most and it feels quite liberating to be honest. If you can, I\u2019d suggest to cut a few of those people off too, it makes a whole lot of difference.\nI have lost my phone so many times during my short life \ud83e\udd23 it\u2019s really annoying but don\u2019t beat yourself up about it, it\u2019s an easy mistake. It is still shitty anyway that you\u2019ve lost your phone but try not to blame yourself. Life is tough enough as it is",

My watch also alerts me if I left me phone somewhere. It\u2019s certainly not a solution for everyone, but I get so sick of being told I\u2019m careless and forgetful (while having to manage everything in the household and needing to know where everything is - not just my own stuff).",
