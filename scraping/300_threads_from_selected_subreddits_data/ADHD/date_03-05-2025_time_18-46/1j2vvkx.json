    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been taking adderall for about 6 months now to help with my ADHD and it has helped me tremendously.\n\nI started on 30mg XR, then after a month went to 20mg IR in the am and 10mg IR in the afternoon. This didn\u2019t feel like it was doing enough so I asked to go up to 30mg IR in the am and 10mg IR in the afternoon. After a lot of convincing I was able to go up. For the past 4 months or so that has been my dosage.\n\nIt still doesn\u2019t feel as effective as I would like it to be, so for the past 2 months I\u2019ve been taking 30mg in the am, 10 a few hours later, and then 10 more around 5pm. Thus, I\u2019ve been running out about a week early the past two months.\n\nMy therapist said to always get my medication early, so you always have some in reserve, but my doctor seems very suspicious everytime I ask this and tries to not allow me to pick it up until it\u2019s been exactly 30 days.\n\nThis month, I ran out and my 30 days doesn\u2019t hit until the 10th, so I asked her if I could pick it up a few days early. I haven\u2019t told her I ran out, but last month I told her I used a few extra because of midterms, and she said (pretty sternly) not to do that.\n\nWhen I asked her to pick up early this month, she said she may have me go to a psychiatrist for \u201cmedication management.\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean? Should I be worried? Is she trying to lower my dose or does she think I\u2019m abusing my medication? I\u2019m not sure what to do.\n\nThanks!\n",

You should use it the way you and your doctor discussed. \n\nDoing stuff like that can be a huge red flag for abusing your prescription. Doctors are very aware we are in an epidemic where people are misusing medication. \n\nOn the psych. You should be happy to speak with a psychiatrist. They studied medication effects on the body, and they know better than your primary care provider how things interact. You may want to consider a different medication if Adderall isn't doing what it needs to. Medication is not one size fits all.",

They felt comfortable writing you the initial prescription according to the general guidelines for beginning this kind of treatment, but if those aren't working (too many side effects, tweaking the dosing to your individual needs, etc) then they refer you to an expert. Psychiatrists are doctors who specialize in mental health conditions and the medications (and other tools) that are used to manage them-that expertise will help you more than your regular doctor is able to do. It's not a problem, they're basically saying \"OK this is getting a little over my head, so I'm sending you to an expert.\"",

He prescribed a medication for me for short term, but I need it long term and he did not feel comfortable overseeing that. Particularly when you are taking stimulants, benzodiazepines or anything addictive or easily abused, they will generally turn you over to a specialist to manage your meds. Or if you have any undiagnosed issues, it\u2019s better to have one specialist looking at everything rather than seeing multiple doctors and potentially missing any contraindications in your prescriptions, because it happens! I still see my primary care for regular stuff, but for meds and everything psychiatric I am glad I can go to my psychiatrist.",

Also something worth noting, is that medication is a tool to help get you started but you have to still put in effort to get things done. It sounds like you may be expecting too much from your meds. I agree with everyone else here that a psychiatrist should be able to help you get the right dose of the right medication and I strongly recommend you only take your meds as directed.",

You should definitely stop taking extra, I know it's going to suck for a little bit but it's better to talk to your doctor about this kind of stuff if medication isn't working so that they can adjust it accordingly.

Now maybe there are exceptions for if a doctor is approving an early refill, but I haven\u2019t heard of it.\n\nAt some point, either your doctor or even the pharmacist can call for a pill count.  They\u2019ll count how many you are supposed to take per day, times the amount of pills you\u2019ve picked up, and then have a number of pills that you should have at the current date/time.  Normally just having a few less than you should can raise an issue, but it sounds like you actually would be short by an entire month\u2019s supply at this point. If a pill count ever is called, that might be a major issue.\n\nThe reason pharmacist and doctors take this so seriously, is because they can be liable if it\u2019s found out they are not checking these and being too loose (not the legal terminology) with prescribing a schedule 2 controlled substance. They can lose their license to prescribe/fill medications, and possibly even face legal charges.  That\u2019s why you have doctors now who refuse to even prescribe it, as they don\u2019t want to take that risk.\n\nYou should 100% take them up on seeing a psychiatrist, even better if it\u2019s one that specializes in ADHD. They can work with you on changing the dosage, changing the times you take it, and even changing to another prescription.\n\nYou should stop taking more than your prescribed starting yesterday. 1. Because of the above mentioned issue.  2. Because continually upping your dosage isn\u2019t safe and can actually have the opposite effect. 3. Because continually upping the dosage can coincide with getting addicted to the medication.  You may unknowingly be chasing the \u201chigh\u201d or \u201ceuphoria\u201d that can come with starting your first stimulant medication.  For me personally it wore off after about 2 months on the medication and the effects of the medication became a bit more subtle. I have increased the dose twice in the past two years after feeling the effects really start to dwindle. I still need to try and concentrate on a specific task, at least to start it. And I take proactive steps to assist with focusing on the task I need to (having screentime limits on social apps, keeping my work/study area clear of distractions, try to be on a schedule for waking up and sleeping as that helps me stay on task better for the entire day, etc).  Those are just my suggestions though, and I wish you the best on this journey.",
