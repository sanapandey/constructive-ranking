    "selftext": "Hello everyone, I'm a long time lurker, first time poster. I was wondering if anyone else feels like they HAVE to do multiple things at once to attain better focus. For example, if I'm working on a school assignment, I have to be listening to music or take breaks to fidget with my pencil, or I might be Fidgeting with something else in my other hand. If I try to concentrate on just one thing, I often can't focus on it and I end up feeling irrritated and procrastinating on it. Does anyone else feel this way?",

The background noise helps with dual stimulation and makes it so I can actually focus on my main tasks more. \n\nHeck, even when I\u2019m playing a video game, I mute the TV and play something else cause focusing on two separate topics helps me focus on the game",
