    "selftext": "I\u2019m 37 and have been fighting anxiety most of my adult life. My wife suggested that I get tested for ADHD and well it turns out I have ADHD.\n\nI got prescribed adderral XR 10mg after trying Straterra which is terrible. \n\n-The first day I was kind of wired but no anxiety. Bad crash at the end of the day\n-Second day I was calm, still no anxiety.  End of day crash \nBy about the 4th day the meds just made me tired and depressed with each day getting worse. BUT no anxiety.\n\nI stopped taking it and went back to the doctor\n\nDoctor prescribed me an additional 5mg dose to help with the end of the day crash.\n\nIt helped at first. Then after a few days I would start to crash, take the extra dose and it pretty much didn\u2019t do anything. I got so deep into depression that I had to stop.\n\nI\u2019m just curious if anybody else has had this experience??",

On Vyvanse, the crash was bad enough to prompt my prescriber changing my meds. She switched me to Dyanavel XR, which is another long-lasting stimulant. All of the symptom relief is the same, but there is no crash. I take one pill in the AM and a 1/4 dose booster midday.\n\nYou may want to discuss other stimulant options with your doctor. Depression is not an acceptable trade-off for anxiety relief.",

I'm currently taking extended release Adderall and an immediate release in the afternoon.\n\n\nIt took me a while to dial in my dosage. You may need to tweak both dosages to dial it in for your self. Adderall is probably the most approachable with dosages and extended and immediate relaease. But ultimately if the crash with Adderall is that bad see if Concerta or Vyvanse work better.",

            "body": "I\u2019m not a doctor. This exact thing happened to me. You could be a fast metabolizer for stimulants. The afternoon dose probably isn\u2019t working because it\u2019s too low of a dose to accommodate the crash, and you\u2019d need a full 10mg. You may need 10mg more than 2x a day if you\u2019re a fast metabolizer, because tolerance builds pretty quick when you\u2019re a fast metabolizer. \n\nI had to switch to a methylphenidate med bc I would metabolize adderall too quickly and crash 2 hours after the dose. I tried extended release meds and would metabolize them within 2-3 hours, which was even worse because the extended release meds are usually a higher dose. Jornay PM eventually worked best for me due to the release mechanism. I\u2019m not on adhd meds anymore because my body can\u2019t maintain therapeutic levels due to the constant crashing.",

            "body": "48m on 30mg Adderall XR daily here, also a life long anxiety sufferer and I would have some pretty tough depressive episodes once I started on Adderall, and it started to wear off. As part of my treatment, I spoke to my doctor and I also now take 20mg Fluoxetine (generic for Prozac), it helped immensely. I don't feel the lows (but also don't feel the highs) as badly, and can get through the end of my day easier. \n\nYou may want to consider either increasing your dose or adding something else to the mix to help your peace, OP. Though, your milage may vary on what works for you - wishing you nothing but success and help in finding the right balance for you!",
