Now, at almost 29 years old, I am thinking of giving up on life and the fact that I will never do anything that I will ever like. Have you managed to follow your dream or have the problems of ADHD buried you?",

I have a good life, I've seen and done some amazing things, I have a family who love me, a job that doesn't suck and pays really well, a bunch of fun hobbies waiting for me whenever my ADHD brain decides to find any of them ragingly interesting again (I still haven't fully figured out the logic behind that, and I've made peace with that as well), and I believe that I am probably happier than most, judging by what's currently going on in the world (side note: humanity, wtf, please stop).",

Especially considering the music thing and running. \n\nYou won\u2019t be surprised to learn but I\u2019ve picked up running since the last 2 years and my main ambition in life is still music. With running I failed miserably in my first year due to going all out and going from couch to marathon. Injured myself very badly after 3 months in the program which took me out for 3/4 months. I did fell in love with running in that time due to the impact on my mental health and what it did for my adhd. I\u2019m back at it since July, but building it up verrrrry slowly and I\u2019m at 5K 5 days in a row and topping it of with 10k on Sunday. With the main goal of doing marathons and iron man\u2019s. Mainly because it\u2019s the best medicine I\u2019ve ever tried for my adhd and I want this medicine in my life everyday of the week.\n\nWhat\u2019s the aspect of adhd that held you back with music? Due to my line of work as a photographer and videographer and get in touch and know a lot of big artists/musicians (from bands to dj\u2019s/to producers) and I\u2019m 100% convinced they all have either adhd/add or autism or a mix off. My main objective is still to get into music and I probably understand your struggles. I\u2019ve had a lot of struggles with finding musicians to work with myself ever since I started (back in 2004) and only now I feel that I found the correct band to finally achieve what I always envisioned. You never fail if you don\u2019t stop! I\u2019d just be a random stranger on Reddit who would be sad for you if you give up on your dreams due to adhd. While it could also be your strongest power when used well",

                            "body": "With the running: don't get me wrong, I've done some awesome runs, including several trail marathons (one of which kicked my ass hard), a self-supported 60k run, a self-supported speedhike where I did 125 km in 3 days with a 6 kg pack, etc. But I know I don't have the discipline long term to put in the consistent, fine-tuned training that is necessary to get truly competitive times in the Marathon, or pretty much any distance for that matter. My fastest marathon time was 4:35 (although that was a trail marathon with lots of sand and a fair bit of elevation), I could probably do 4:00 flat on the road, but sub-3 is definitely not going to happen.\n\nMusic: my ADHD (undiagnosed at the time, and unknown even to me) made it impossible for me to put in serious study time at will - I can get \"hot\" about music and practice obsessively for a month, maybe two, and then the switch goes to \"off\", and just unpacking the instrument becomes a chore, never mind doing any meaningful deliberate practice. My brain thrives on jumping between interests, but the music industry is full of people who are about one thing, and one thing only, and while I'm pretty good with a trombone, I'll never be as good as the guys who spent every waking hour playing trombone, thinking about playing trombone, preparing to play trombone, or talking about playing trombone, for 15 years straight. ADHD has also ruined a few golden opportunities for me. I got in touch with one of the leading salsa groups in the Netherlands at one point, played a gig and did well, got called for another gig, failed to prepare properly, embarrassed myself and the bandleader and the singer we were supporting, and that was the end of that. My social skills have also been hampered by ADHD, and that's really really bad in a world where it's all about connections and networking and all that. The persona I had adopted as a mask would also often come across as ignorant, self-absorbed, or condescending, and I hurt quite a few people saying things I didn't even mean. And then there's the fact that if you want to make a living as a performing musician, you have to accept jobs that are not fun, like playing stupid top-100 songs for a bunch of drunken people at a company party, no creativity, just replicate the recorded version everyone knows, and all that for mediocre pay and a lousy catered meal. You have to accept these gigs, and you have to perform excellently, because if you don't, they won't call you again - not for terrible jobs, but not for nice jobs either. And I was terrible at that; I hated those jobs, and it showed, and that's not a good basis to build a career on.\n\nAnd then one of the day jobs I had turned into an opportunity for making a career switch into programming, just when my wife was expecting, so the idea of working 24 hours per week instead of 80 while doubling my income was kind of a no-brainer. I then did the family thing, put my kids through elementary school, and then, just when I was considering another go at it, COVID-19 happened, and pretty much the entire music industry collapsed overnight. We're still seeing the aftermath of that, and by now, 20 years after I graduated conservatory, my network is pretty much nonexistent, and all the places I used to frequent to meet like-minded musicians are gone, so I'm still not doing an awful lot - but I do have a few things cooking, so it's not like I'm completely out of the running, I just enjoy the luxury of being under no pressure and not having to say \"yes\" to everything.",

            "body": "(Eng not my native)\n\nSame here. Lastly im in panic because i have 0 discipline.\n\nBut despite everything, I continue to strive for it. There is a goal - I have to go, even if I don\u2019t want to anymore, even if it brings me sadness and disappointment. I have to and that\u2019s it.\n\nIt seems to me that I am giving up morally. But even if I will give up, I will strive to reach the goal.\n\nThis is how I try to live:\n1. Friendly environment / drawing boundaries with unnecessary people. I already have less energy than others.\n2. Supportive loved ones. I naturally have no one except for an imaginary friend and it works. Let him at least sympathize with me and ask me to finish my tasks.\n3. Deal with traumas, bad mindset and other things. Cure mental illnesses that you can. Because it eats up energy.\n4. FORBID YOURSELF SHAME AND WINDING UP SADNESS. NO PESSIMISM! \"No, I won't think about it.\", \"Yes, I did badly, but I refuse to be ashamed. Today I missed the whole day AGAIN and that's okay. I live the best I can. I have tomorrow\" I have little energy as it is. Self-blame = regression. If you want to progress, then relax about even the most terrible mistakes. You can admit a mistake without self-abasement.\n5. Constantly remind yourself of even the smallest victories. Cultivate this in yourself. Kind words addressed to yourself can support and help you move on.\n\nAt the moment, I am in a panic and I almost gave up. But it doesn't matter. Dreams are nonsense, there are only goals. And goals are a responsibility, not a whim. You don't need to have inspiration to trying to fulfill your responsibilities.\n\nLately, I have discovered that I am very slowed down by a constant feeling of fear. I often DO NOT feel safe. As a result, I found out that tasks and goals are a kind of trigger for me. Because as a child I was suddenly yelled at a lot for irrational reasons (my parents are mentally ill, now they are on pills and everything is fine). And also because my family does not accept me, because I am a slacker, and they are a famous rich ancient family with awards (Do you know Glam from \"Metal Family\" or Bruno from the Disney cartoon? Same case).\n\nSo being unproductive for me is:\n- to disgrace the whole family (I don't even care that I was expelled, I'm just tired of high expectations literally since childhood and from hatred)\n- to see one bad day as a symptom of the fact that I will miss my whole life. A small task in my head turns into a battle for life, of course I am stressed. Stressed = losing energy = doing nothing.\n- I am afraid purely instinctively that at any moment someone will burst into my room and start yelling because I am not productive enough. Even though this won't happen anymore, the fears still remain.\n\nIn short, deep inside there are a bunch of problems that drain my mental energy. So it's not surprising that I do nothing. I'm fighting my stupid demons inside.\n\nRemember the phrase, OP, \"being calm does not mean doing nothing.\" If you think that without a dream in life you will be better off, then I doubt it. After all, with a dream, internal problems will not go away, these are separate things, you will also suffer.\n\nSometimes I have the moral strength to do something useful, but by that time my hyperactivity exhausts me physically and I can't do anything. ADHD + anemia is HELL!\n\nSo another important piece of advice:\n6. Monitor your physical health and exercise!\n\nI also suspect OCD... Am I doomed, right? Am I just globally doomed? A person like me will never achieve anything in life. It's a pity, but what can I do, I have to go my own way.",

            "body": "Hey!\n\nI can relate, but short answer is NO, don't give up on your dreams.\n\nHere's how I see it:\n\nI was undiagnosed and life was so, so hard. I built a life while undiagnosed. So I built a life when I had the wrong idea about who I am: I'm lazy, I'm stupid, I'm shallow... For the longest time I thought ADHD means \"little boy bouncing off the walls\", and never considered I could have it - and considering something like this would feel like I'm just making excuses for how incompetent I am. So I did achieve, but torturously, punishing myself at every step, not sleeping then being angry with myself for not sleeping, etc.\n\nLater on: Now I've been diagnosed. I'm learning so much about how my behaviors make sense. I didn't have to hate myself and punish myself nor internalize what others told me (I'm lazy, I'm not trying hard enough - \"just do it\", just take it seriously, just focus, just use a planner..). So, who am I? How do I live an authentic life?\n\nI've accomplished a lot even through the torture I was putting myself through. Now that I don't need to torture myself, I can actually work *with* and not against my needs.\n\nSo you can have dreams again and follow your dreams. You are just as capable as you were before, and even more empowered. It takes a while to heal from the burnout, but it's like being \"reborn\" in a sense - you're still you, but now you have a different sense and understanding of self!",

The diagnosis and treatment actually made me more effective. \n\nI'm a musician, songwriter and singer. I played guitar in bands as the lead guitarist for years in my late teens and early twenties. I was in a band that seemed to be on the verge of breaking through but it collapsed because the main songwriter had a big ego and quick temper and pissed off our label manager. After that I had no expectations to make any kind of career out of music. \n\nNowadays, I have little kids, a wife and a life to support. I still work on music all the time. I'm working on my first solo record with a great producer right now and I do plan to release and promote it as well as I can and play live shows as much I can. I'd also like to start a band again and do that whole thing but be the front person. But I've no reason to believe that any of it will come to bring me any fortune or fame. It's purely for my own pleasure and because I love doing it. \n\nMy wife has told me/given me permission that if anything ever took off to the point that I would be able to tour that she would gladly have me do it. She's incredibly supportive. I doubt it will ever come around to that but knowing that my love of my life is onboard is great encouragement to keep going. \n\nIn the meantime I plan to return to vocational school to be an Electrical and Electronic device technician which is involved in many fields from medical to telecommunications to audio. I'd like to get a career in audio building and repairing audio hardware like preamps, compressors, mics, amps, guitar pedals etc. I don't think it's big bucks but I think I'd be happy enough doing it. And it sure beats the hell out if the manual labor jobs I've been doing.",

I thought I was 100% going to be an artist, then I thought I\u2019d be in research psychology, then marketing, real estate, business owner, sales\u2026\n\nAnd lo and behold I somehow landed in web development. Totally different field than my degree and past careers\u2014never even considered it. I love what I do now and it plays well with my ADHD.\n\nI think the best thing we can do for ourselves is be adaptable and accept that we may have to try different careers before finding something we like. Even you don\u2019t stick with them, you\u2019ll gain a lot of experience and skills that you can use for the next one.",
