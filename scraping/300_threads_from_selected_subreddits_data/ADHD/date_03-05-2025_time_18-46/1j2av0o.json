    "selftext": "I personally credit my adhd for leading ke to complexity theory.\n\nThroughout my childhood and adolescence, my obsessive focus jumped from one thing to another, reading over 1000 books on a wide variety of topics, six to 12 weeks or so for each, and I never settled on anything. \n\nAlmost all my friends (except the other adhd ones as it goes) settled on a specific genre of music to get into. I got to benefit from their expertise. And that's how I've gone about my life.\n\nIt led me to be implicitly and instinctively multidisciplinary. It allowed me to see similarities between different fields - the common features of all complex systems. It stopped me from becoming specialized or institutionalized. It helped me remain resolutely independent.\n\nI do wish that I had realised I had audhd before I was 40, but I was lucky to have a stable, supportive family and the privilege to indulge my flightiness, which is a big reason why I never had the kind of trouble that can lead to a diagnosis.\n\nAnyway, complexity. I feel a natural affinity to it. I feel like it's what we evolved to navigate, not this *complicatedness* that is modern civilisation. I feel nature calling me, as I know many people do, and I want to suggest that complexity is at the root of this feeling.\n\nLife is unpredictable. None of us act in isolation. We can't reduce and quantify everything. And that's okay. That's how reality is. \n\nSo if you wanna go down a rabbit hole that you might find intuitive, and that makes more sense than the frameworks imposed by this system, go look up complexity theory.",
