I started my medication (20mg Adderall XR) today and would love to hear about other ADHDer\u2019s experiences with ADHD medication, especially Adderall. I.e what are some changes you have noticed before and after starting medication and how can I know if my medication is working? FYI I am not looking for medical advice. ",

I will say though, you have to plan to be productive, or you\u2019ll just hyper focus on bed-rotting activities like scrolling tiktok.",
