    "selftext": "So, I\u2019m 17 and I definitely think I have ADHD(I\u2019ve written a post on here before for context). And it\u2019s been getting worse lately because of the uncertainty surrounding what I want to be. My mom is as supportive as she can be and stopped seeing me as lazy and she thinks I have it too. My sister thinks I have it because someone who has ADHD told her what made the doctors say she has it (and dad is indifferent) So, everyone was on board to get me tested. I went to my doctor who told me that the procedure for ADHD is to give me a questionnaire and after, send me to a neurologist. However, we talked about why I think I have it and she decided that I don\u2019t (on the spot). She told me that I\u2019m just a teenager and will get over it and told me to get my life together and figure out what I wanna do. I was disheartened but sat there nodding. I left without doing the question or getting sent to a neurologist. Not sure what to do now.\n\nAlso she said that if I had it, a teacher would\u2019ve caught it by now?!?! Is that true?",

Alternatively, it might be worth seeking a different doctor or going through an independent screening process (can cost a bit of money) if you're certain it's getting missed. Although I will point out that other mental health or personality disorders can trigger similar symptoms to ADHD, so I wouldn't rule them out too.\nMaybe arrange a meeting with a mental health therapist. Right down everything you feel is an issue beforehand so you have a comprehensive list and see what insight they can provide. Best of luck man. Getting an official diagnosis can be frustrating so I get you",
