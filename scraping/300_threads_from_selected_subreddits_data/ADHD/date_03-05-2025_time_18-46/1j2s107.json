    "selftext": "I\u2019m considering law school, environmental law specifically. It is something I\u2019m very interested in. Ive always been passionate about environmental justice and I\u2019m also very interested in politics and social happenings that affect the working class population. I have a Bsc in environmental science and work in the field (3 years into working in my field). anyway i have ADHD not medicated (still looking into this) but i want to know if its a field i can thrive in. \n\nI\u2019m curious if anyone here has adhd (diagnosed as adult) who pursued law. I want to know how it\u2019s going for you? Do you enjoy it? Do you regret it? What are the best parts of the job for you and the worst? What kinds of skills natural and learned should you have to go into this field? How has ADHD affected your work (do you feel like it affects you in any way or does it have limitations or is it a great field for someone with ADHD who is passionate about it? Just looking for general words of wisdom! \n\nThanks! ",

I have a theory that adhd (often undiagnosed) is actually slightly over-represented among lawyers compared to the general population. \nBut specifically, I think law is a good fit for the kind of adhd people who do well in school while the rest of life falls apart around that. I loved law school, and I enjoy enough of my practice to feel I made the right choice, although there are plenty of areas that I struggle with too.",

I know myself and how my mind works. Passion is key. When entertaining the idea I focused on the areas of law that 1) were most interesting and by extension stimulating or 2) would allow me to work in industries I was passionate about (example contracts for professional athletes).\n\nAs for why I went a different route, my father\u2019s opinion was that being paid by the hour is a blessing and a curse. Don\u2019t know why that stuck but it did.",

Her ADHD stories are probably the best, including the time a judge scorned her because ''Mrs. Baker, your face!''\n\nShe went from an environment where it was completely unprofessional to show any emotion to one where she can dye her hair weird colors and swear a lot. It suits her.",

            "body": "I\u2019ve been a criminal defense attorney for 21 years. I have untreated ADHD, though I was diagnosed at 8 with what they then called \u201cADD.\u201d My parents didn\u2019t believe in medication, told me about the gifted \u201cdiagnosis,\u201d but not about the ADD\u2014I learned that all much later. Now I\u2019m 55 and in the midst of taking several steps to get medication.\n\nI started my career at the Public Defender\u2019s office and found that I sort of shined in the crazy, out-of-control dockets in misdemeanor court (then felony) because it was chaos and I felt right at home going from client to client. And being reactionary in court is a gift really (as long as you\u2019re right, of course). I was always completely drained of all energy by the end of the week, but I loved everything about litigation\u2014from the hearings to the jury trials\u2014once I was in the courtroom. Plus, we were all overloaded with work. If I screwed up a court appearance once in a while, I usually had a coworker to cover for me, or at least call me and tell me to get my but to court before the judge even noticed. I always had backup.\n\nBut my office days and the days a leading up to trials were agony. We didn\u2019t have office assistants to assist with most of our administrative tasks, so my calendar, keeping deadlines, client contact, and all research and drafting of motions and getting them filed was on me. I loved the work, but had to take so much extra time on weekends to work on stuff I should have been able to finish during the week, (plus my personal life was a dumpster fire), so after 8 years I went into private practice and was able to hire a paralegal and an assistant who took over everything from reminding me about my deadlines, checking my calendar with the courts so that I didn\u2019t miss any appearances, handling &\\^%$#$ electronic files that are supposed to open, but do not &\\^%$% open, and a laundry list of other stuff I no longer had to worry about and it was really a game changer.\n\nBut I still really struggle/d with focus. Writing motions and trial prep are tooth-pulling events in my life and after a few decades of going into hyper-focus mode for every hearing and trial started to wear me down. I\u2019m doing some very limited post-conviction work for my state, now, and can see how \\[edited because I literally just stopped this sentence at \u201chow\u201d\\] my inattention made me freeze with overwhelm so often during those years. Even though I am still struggling, it\u2019s easier because my caseload is small and I now have great assistants.\n\nI am currently trying to use some of the aids my therapist suggested\u2014using a timer to give myself breaks during my tasks, making sure to make a list for the next day of stuff I need to focus on (for when I fall down that rabbit hole of legal research, mostly\u2026), but it\u2019s been slow going.  Maybe if I had started at your age I would have developed better habits/skills/magic to overcome my constantly darting mind, but I do wish I had the knowledge now that I did when I was younger. I would absolutely have chosen trying medication.\n\nIt\u2019s been hard-going, but I don\u2019t regret the path. I have helped many people and done some good in the world, and still can, so that\u2019s pretty cool. The reading and writing (which is 99% of post-conviction) is still challenging, though. Fingers crossed that meds help me sort that out.",

            "body": "Me. Wasn\u2019t diagnosed til last year. I\u2019ll be a lawyer 20 years in August. :)\n\nI had no idea. Just thought I was \u201clegally blonde\u201d\n Like, school was easy, real life was hard. \n\nLitigation was something I stumbled onto because I wanted to do contracts and M&A and IPO and that just wasn\u2019t possible in the post tech bubble burst world. \n\nAnd litigation worked for me. Everything had a deadline that was looming. An admin took care of my organization. A calendaring clerk took care of my court dates. I was encouraged to work long hours and go down rabbit holes for obscure case law. \n\nThere were stereotypes of people that you had to corral and lock in a room and they would turn out brilliant motions. That was me. \n\nBut my work life balance and the state of my house and my bills and whatnot were never in order. My mental health suffered. I also wasn\u2019t diagnosed and when I did get treatment it was for the wrong problem or only part of the problem. \n\nI went, big law too, which meant they worked me hard and I played hard and my impulsivity was a little out of control at times. But I did well and I made a lot of money for the 5 years I toughed it out. \n\nI ended up going to the government and then in house. Much more manageable. And also, I wasn\u2019t diagnosed or medicated for like the first 18 1/2 years of my career. So, totally doable. \n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t recommend something tedious and detail oriented like contract writing. I suuuuck at that. Hate it. Glad I couldn\u2019t get into it when I graduated. Like the *rules* of it. And I like writing. But I don\u2019t do well at remembering what I wrote *specifically* 50 pages ago. Or if I used a little i or an italicized a with a ). Or if we are using , or ;  And missing a \u201cnot\u201d or a comma is *devastating* when they find it out 3 years later.",

I had the same experience in my first 12-ish years of practice. I enjoyed learning things and the challenge. \n\nThen the cumulative stress caught up with me. \n\nI hate the job now.\n\nI still like meeting people and hearing their stories. I don\u2019t like the pressure to bill every second of my day. I don\u2019t like juggling all of the deadlines, details, and competing tasks and priorities. I hate the needless conflict and egos. I do transactional contract drafting and other things like that and I find it painfully boring. I won\u2019t do litigation because of the stress and the ridiculous posturing and conflict.\n\nIf you do go to law school, focus on minimizing your debt as much as possible so you don\u2019t get trapped.",

            "body": "Hi, I\u2019m a contracts lawyer/solicitor in England and combined type adhd. Wanted to be a solicitor from being a kid. School was fine, college and university were rough!!! I didn\u2019t realise I had adhd till I was in my 30s and already qualified.\u00a0\n\nI work in local government practice, rather than private practice, it suits me much better as it\u2019s a lot less business driven and more need driven.\u00a0\n\nI actually always wanted to do family law to help kids have a better life. Did a few years in child protection and then adult court of protection. It was super interesting but\u00a0very emotionally draining. Be careful if you\u2019re very passionate about your chosen area that it\u2019s not one which will burn you out.\u00a0\n\nI can really struggle in the day-to-day, but I think my adhd helps me to be a good lawyer. I\u2019m also helped by having a good employer that has helpful structures and processes. I haven\u2019t disclosed my adhd but I\u2019m able to set things up to how I need them and that makes a huge difference.\u00a0\n\nOverall, I\u2019d say that it\u2019s very possible to thrive with adhd in law! Definitely try to get some work experience or shadowing to see if you like it and could see yourself doing it, or see if you could go to court to watch if you\u2019re likely to go down the litigation route. Good luck!\u00a0",
