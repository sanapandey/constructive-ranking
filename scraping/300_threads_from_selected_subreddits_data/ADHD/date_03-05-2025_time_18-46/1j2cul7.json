It was kind of meh for me, I gladly stopped taking them, but they were never like \u201choly fuck what are these doing to my brain\u201d like SSRIs were. Again not bashing them for people for whom they work. My OCD wasn\u2019t much of a problem for me on before I started SNRIs so can\u2019t really speak to their effectiveness.",

The brand name of setraline Zoloft actually gave me the worst sexual side effects whereas another non-brand name ssri made them better. I took 4 different brands of setraline so far the so called best one has been kinda the worst one for me. This probably isnt true but the pill shaped pill gave me worse sexual side effects than rounded ones lol.",
