I can\u2019t zero in on anything for more than a few minutes at a time and it\u2019s wasting so much of my time and I can\u2019t do all the things I want on any given day. Anyone else feel this way? Any tips? Appreciate it! ",

It\u2019s so frustrating when you want to focus, but it feels impossible.\n\n\nOne thing that helped me was breaking tasks into ridiculously small steps. Like, instead of \u201cwrite an email,\u201d I\u2019d make step one: \u201copen Gmail.\u201d Sounds dumb, but it lowered the activation energy enough to keep me moving. Also, body-doubling\u2014just having someone around (even virtually) helps me stay on track.\n\n\nThat said, this video really captures what it's like to struggle with focus before and after meds. If you relate to this, it might give you some insight: https://youtu.be/bQ_wDpISzGY.\n\n\nHope you find something that works for you!",
