I know these are all symptoms to be worked on improving and I know it\u2019s not inherently my fault but they make me feel like such a horrible person and a waste of space. Like why can\u2019t I just be normal, and why does it hurt to explain myself to non adhd people about how I\u2019m not lazy but affected by a mental issue. I\u2019m so done. ",
