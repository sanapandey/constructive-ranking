    "selftext": "I was diagnosed with ADHD at private hospital but unfortunately I can't pay for it anymore. I went to public hospital and even though showed doctor the MOXO test results she didn't care, just prescribed me antidepressants and antipsychotic. I can't work at a job because of my mental ilnesses and not being treated with ADHD is really tough. What can I do to cope with ADHD? I used to love gaming and anime but now most of the time they're just boring so I do nothing all day. Meds really helped me with being productive and having fun but now I can't even enjoy anything. My biggest problem is that I can't enjoy anything ans get bored easily. I wanna be able to enjoy stuff and have a job.",

            "body": "Since you were being treated for ADHD at the private hospital, they would also have a written ADHD diagnosis along with the test results. See if you can get in contact with that previous hospital and attain all the records, especially that diagnosis. I can\u2019t say it\u2019ll magically make the public one start treating you for ADHD, but they usually need more than just the MOXO results, especially if you\u2019re new to the hospital.",

            "body": "That sounds really tough, and I totally get why you\u2019re struggling. Losing access to meds when they were actually helping is beyond frustrating, especially when the doctor just brushes off your ADHD.\n\n\nWhen I couldn\u2019t get meds for a while, I had to find ways to at least make things slightly more manageable. Having a routine (even if I hated sticking to it) helped keep me from spiraling. I also had to force myself to do things before I felt like it, because waiting for motivation never worked. Gaming and anime used to be my escape too, but when they stopped being fun, I tried switching things up\u2014different genres, playing with friends, even watching reaction videos just to feel something.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not the same as meds, and it\u2019s unfair that you even have to deal with this. But if you\u2019re looking for something that really captures what it\u2019s like to lose the structure and motivation that meds give, this video hits hard: https://youtu.be/bQ_wDpISzGY. Hope things get better for you soon.",
