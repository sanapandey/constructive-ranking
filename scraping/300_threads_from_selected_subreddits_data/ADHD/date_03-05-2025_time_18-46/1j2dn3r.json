    "selftext": "19M, been diagnosed last November, taking methyphenidate 10mg for a month or so\n\nMy performance in college was really rock bottom and now it is finding new levels of low. My parents/teachers have been disappointed of my academics since childhood and so I am used to it but now it even worse. I scoring single digits of 60 ( I admit i completed the syllabus a day before exam and didmt revise well) but I got the questions wrong in which I was super confident but I lost the marks because of a silliest mistake ( took + instead of - in first step) and lost 16marks of 60, IN A QUESTION I HAD PRACTISED\n\nI am addicted to reels, p*rn, when therapist told me you have this this, I was like ok no problem I'll work harder but not I am just blaming my brain for everything and playing a victim card infront of my own mind. I can't sleep on time, can't focus on books, no matter how hard i try\n\nAnd meds,first 2 days they worked wonders but now even after taking them, I feel nothing, absolutely NOTHING, no emotions what do ever, I want to cry as it feels better but now my tears won't even come out and I am constantly fighting myself, who constantly think I am loser and makes me belief that I am.\n\nIk I am not capable of 10cgpa and ik i haven't even worked hard for 9cgpa but fuck ill probably won't even get 7 this sem. I am fucked plus the education debt haunts me\n\nIdk what to do, probably mods will delete this and I have wasted my time yet again. My life is a waste and I am always gonna be a loser. \n\n",

It's more stimulating and easier that way. \n\nAbout going to bed, if falling asleep is the problem, you could ask your doctor for hydroxyzine (10mg should suffice)\n\nAbout you seemingly firming a resilience to medication, you might ask your doctor to increase the dose",
