And so and I'm afraid to take anything like that in fear that since they are so chemically alike it will set me off again. I can't afford to have an episode again. Has anyone been in the same situation? And have you still tried the meds? Did anythi",

            "body": "I'm an ex addict who was also addicted to that (among other things) years ago who has also experienced m*** induced psychosis and I am currently on Adderall and it has helped tremendously with my ADHD. My doctor knows about my past and he had me sign a contract to be on stimulant medication which is totally understandable given my past history. I have not abused my medication nor do I ever plan on abusing my medication and even with my past I have never abused any medication I was ever prescribed. It can be risky prescribing something like this for ex addicts but also unmedicated and untreated ADHD puts you at higher risk for abusing substances. I have never experienced psychosis on this medication but it is a possible side effect that can happen for some people (I think it might be rare though?)  but there's also other stimulant medications that do not have those ingredients and there's non-stimulant medications, which did not work for me.\n\nAlso while ingredients in Adderall are similar to what you're talking about they are not the exact same. There's also other reasons why psychosis can happen from ****  (which is the reason it happened to me) but I can't really get into it on here without my comment getting deleted.",

Plus I've also got some other mental health issues I'm bipolar 1, ADHD, with anxiety. So I take a lotta medications. Getting back to the point. Since Adderall did make me a little manic sometimes they put me on Xanax 1mg 3 times daily. So I would guess that would be helpful for you",
