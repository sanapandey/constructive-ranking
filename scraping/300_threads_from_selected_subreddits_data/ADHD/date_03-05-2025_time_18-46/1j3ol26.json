    "selftext": "Took my first dose this morning, threw up two hours after taking it and have felt like a zombie ever since. I got on meds because even though I've known I have ADHD for years, in college it has become really hard to stay up with school and also just managing myself now that I don't have my parents living with me. But today I've been less productive than any other day in the past two weeks without meds. I know there's an adjustment period but I can't feel like this for four weeks or else I'll never be caught up with schoolwork. Ugh. I honestly just want to give up on it right now because everything online just talks about how horrible straterra is. ",

            "body": "So, I started Adderall one month ago, and it works great for me. I did have some slight side effects at first- headaches the first week, and mild heart palpitations that have gone away completely. I\u2019m happy with it so far.\n\nMy question to you is, did you throw up because of the medication? Are you sure? Are you maybe sick?If it was the meds, I would talk to your prescriber about it, maybe they will try you on something else. I was fortunate, but some people have to try several medications/dosages before they find the right one.",

I called my pharmacy about it and they said it could just be me adjusting to it- but I don\u2019t know if I can handle throwing up everyday for a week or two lol. I think I\u2019ll try taking it at night cause I\u2019ve heard that can help some people with symptoms. If that doesn\u2019t work than I may talk to my provider about trying something different- but I\u2019m also considering just waiting til summer when I don\u2019t have a million things I have to do everyday. Missing a \u00a0day of doing work like today sets me back so far in my major it feels like, and as you can imagine ADHD doesn\u2019t go well with that- thanks for your reply though, you give me hope that something will work.",

            "body": "Strattera does not work immediately. It takes weeks to see the full effects of the existing dosage you are prescribed. I would suggest taking a quick look through some journal articles on good to help understand the method of interaction and timeline. \n\nI highly doubt it was from the medication, and more a coincidence in timing and you being ill/fatigued from something tertiary.\n\nAs for my personal experience and \"worth\"...  I was on strattera for a period of about 6 months. It was the first med I tried. It was both the best and worst time of my life. It was extremely effective for my ADHD and validating for my struggles in life/lack of normalcy. However, I had nearly every possible side effect and I tell you, there were some tolerable ones, and some very significant impacts on quality of life. \n\nWas it worth it? Yes, I learned a lot about myself and medication. Was it a partially miserable experience? Also yes. \n\nThat said, everyone's experience and benefits are not the same. Neither are the side effects. Go in with an open mind, educate yourself and ask your doctor questions. Give it time.",
