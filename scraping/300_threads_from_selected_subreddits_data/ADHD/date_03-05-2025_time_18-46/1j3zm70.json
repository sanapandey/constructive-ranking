If the pharmacy is being a fool and not wanting to tell you what they have in stock, ask your prescriber / doctor and their staff to help find a pharmacy for you.\n2. If the Concerta shortage has a wide radius in your area, the prescriber might switch your stimulant temporarily until Concerta returns back in stock. Concerta is a long-acting methylphenidate so they may try to match you with another long-acting methylphenidate  or long-acting dexmethylphenidate.\n\nHope this helps!",

I\u2019ve dealt with this many times as a parent, and it is so frustrating.\u00a0\n\nI agree with the advice to contact other pharmacies and/or talk to your provider about temporarily changing meds. One thing that has worked in our case is temporarily changing (reducing) the dosage.\u00a0\n\nLong term, changing pharmacies also helped. We were at a large chain pharmacy but switched to a local pharmacy. They\u2019ve only been out of stock once in the last couple of years since we switched.\u00a0",

Have had only one time in 18 months I couldn't get Adderall at my local pharmacy, and they are willing to tell me ahead of time what they have in stock/can fill (they even put it on their website - not just stimulants but other meds people have had trouble finding). I also ask my doctor for paper prescriptions - a little less convenient than electronic in an ideal world, but far easier to take to another pharmacy if needed.",

I\u2019ve been in the same boat before, and the internal chaos without meds is brutal.\n\n\nWhat helped me get through it (barely) was trying to keep my routine as normal as possible\u2014if I completely fell off, it was 10x harder to get back on track. Body-doubling (even just having a stream or podcast on) helped me focus a little. Caffeine took the edge off a bit, but I had to be careful not to overdo it. If I got super restless, movement helped\u2014just pacing, stretching, anything to burn off that extra noise in my head.\n\n\nIt\u2019s not the same as meds, but it might help you hold out until your prescription gets filled. If you need a relatable distraction, this video really captures what it\u2019s like dealing with ADHD med struggles: https://youtu.be/bQ_wDpISzGY. Hang in there!",
