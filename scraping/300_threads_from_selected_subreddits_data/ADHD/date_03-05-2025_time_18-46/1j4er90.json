    "selftext": "Hey fellow ADHDers,\n\nI\u2019ve been on Elvanse/Vyvanse (40mg) for about three months now, and it seems to be my ideal dose\u2014long-lasting, no side effects, and overall, it has improved my life significantly. Uni is going better than ever, and my student job is both enjoyable and well-paying.\n\nHowever, for the past two weeks, I\u2019ve noticed something odd: outside of work and responsibilities, I have zero interest in anything. My hobbies, relaxing, even just aimlessly scrolling\u2014I don\u2019t feel like doing anything. It\u2019s like my brain just shuts off fun mode. Once the meds wear off, I mostly feel... bored. I do take days off medication (usually 2 days a week). \n\nThis is weird because I\u2019ve always been someone who could easily find ways to spend my time. I\u2019ve had tons of hobbies and never struggled with finding something to be passionate about.\n\nFor context: I have a history of depression, but ever since my ADHD diagnosis at 22, I haven\u2019t really struggled with it. I know what anhedonia feels like, and while this resembles it a bit, I\u2019m confident this isn\u2019t depression. I feel balanced, emotionally stable, and objectively, life is going well\u20141.0 GPA at uni, a fulfilling student job\u2014yet everything suddenly feels so monotonous?\n\nI know this isn\u2019t the worst issue to have, and I\u2019m not trying to complain\u2014I\u2019m just genuinely confused. Has anyone else experienced this on Vyvanse? Is this an ADHD thing, a med thing, or something else entirely? Would love to hear your thoughts! ",
