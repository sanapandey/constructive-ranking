    "selftext": "I\u2019m in a long-distance marriage, and my wedding ring was one of the few  things that made me feel close to my partner every day. But I lost it, twice. And now, I feel completely devastated.\n\nI have ADHD, so I struggle a lot with misplacing things, and even though I try to be careful, it still happens. I had routines in place, specific spots to put it, but somehow, I still lost it.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about the ring itself, it was a comfort, a constant reminder of my partner when we\u2019re miles apart. And now, I feel this overwhelming emptiness and guilt, like I\u2019ve lost a part of us. I know it\u2019s just an object, but it meant so much to me.\n\nI feel like such an idiot for losing it again. I keep retracing my steps, hoping it\u2019ll turn up, but deep down, I feel like it\u2019s gone for good.\n\nHas anyone else been through something like this? How do you deal with the guilt and sadness? I just feel so heartbroken right now.",

Therefore, one has to take great care not to lose that special person. \n\nIn OP's case; the ring is not as valuable as the partner. The misplacement of the ring might be a sign that they might need to nurture the relationship more. But I have not found that special person myself as of yet, so that is definitely total bs, and I am reading way too much into it as always, lol. \n\nFor OP: Do what they do in many other cultures and wear a wedding symbol around your neck at all times. If you find the ring or get another special item from your partner to attach to a necklace. We need some crutches from time to time as it is easier for us to misplace or screw up stuff that people in general find easy.",

Found it was so happy. hubby who doesn't have adhd had lost 2 or 3 rings. like a year ago or so i got silicon rings. Those were great I only stopped when I found my OG and the. switched to another cheap one. I prefer the cheap ones, if I lose them it's annoying but I won't cry over losing an important one. \n\nI get it. I felt like a monster when I lost my ring. But I think of it like this. when my hubby lost his ring was I mad at him. No, I just bought him a new one so he would have something. And I told him it was okay and not to feel guilty and he said the same for me. Shit happens. adhd or not",

Yes - there is the sensory issue but what we found is that you need to stick with it for a few weeks and then you get used to it and the sensory issue doesn\u2019t bother us now. I can\u2019t imagine keeping taking it off and putting it on - I think that would have much harder to regulate sensory wise. Also I\u2019m in the healthcare field so I just made sure it\u2019s quite tight so it won\u2019t slip off if I\u2019m using gloves or something like that. It actually accumulates more bacteria if people keep taking it off, if you always have it you clean it constantly when you wash your hands.",
