    "selftext": "I'm not sure if my problem is part of ADHD since I have mild ADHD but Ive noticed that almost everyday I go to school, at some point in the day my partner gets annoyed, I won't even know why most of the time, she'll at some point just get really passive aggressive towards me and say that I suck and that I'm always annoying, when I go to ask her what I did to annoy her she says that she's already told me a bunch and that I don't listen, I tell her that I didn't hear and that I'm sorry and I ask again but then she just starts to ignore me, I feel like something is wrong with me but I don't know what, I've lightly searched up issues towards hearing people but I don't know any solutions, any help would be greatly appreciated.",

A far simpler explanation is that this is a relationship issue, not a neurological one.\n\nEDIT: which I don't mean to weigh in on what the source of the issue would be, or who's \"right!\" Sometimes partners tune each other out; sometimes partners don't express themselves as clearly as they think. I'm just saying not to assume that multiple people experience something that only your intimate partner has mentioned.",

It could be not a hearing issue but an understanding / reading people issue that a lot of adhd ppl struggle with",
