    "selftext": "i have a severe crippling lack of any perseverance whatsoever.\n\n  \nfor some reason when i want to learn something its like my mind expects a straightforward path but that literally everything but reality.\n\n  \nI know it takes mistakes and practice to master something. Im trying to learn a new language.. well.. more accurately, trying to *relearn* a language that I used to know. It's really demotivating having all of your friends and family that can speak their native tongue while I can't. I want to practice, but everytime it sounds so broken and cringe, while everyone else is so fluent, I know i just need to practice more and eventually I will get it, that is the path to success, to keep trying and to never give up. But my mind tells me otherwise, dumps negative motivation at me such as replaying all of my cringe fuckups, and comparing myself over people who have literally spoken that language their entire life, its not a fair comparison at all so I will never win. eventually i come to the conclusion that the risk of failure is not worth the effort, imagine practicing for years, and never mastering it, always sounding like a foreigner of a different planet when i speak a language. And everytime i start practicing again, its just more cringe memories to add to the cringe pile. its not like my family is judging me or anything, they accept me for who I am, even if i speak my broken ways, its literally just me thats holding me back. How do i break this cycle? this happens to legit everything, learning a language, socializing, starting a new hobby, anything.",

I already acknowledged that which is already a huge step. im trying to stop hating on myself so much. because how can you love others if you can't love yourself?",

It\u2019s how many people have learned English (one of the hardest languages btw). Force yourself into situations where you must use what you know. Consume media in that language, change your devices to that language. It\u2019ll get easier before you know it.",
