Can you lovely people please help me know if also seems like that to you? THANKS",

And just actively do this, consciously putting that black screen in the front, and focusing only on it, relentlessly. \n\nEventually I get tired from actively doing this and the black screen wins, or I have some very irrelevant thoughts that don\u2019t have any weight to them and I fall asleep with them without noticing. \n\nThis works for me, idk if it works for everyone. And for the music, if it happens to you, I distract myself by talking to myself in my head, usually just repeating the word \u201cblack screen\u201d a lot.",

I lay down for about 5-7 minutes, and it helps break the overwhelming number of thoughts.\n\nThe more intrusive thoughts may be due to ADHD and anxiety. Throughout the day, your brain may push on certain thoughts that might be anxiety provoking. At some point, your brain remembered or thought of something that might be important in the future. When this happens, it's best to appreciate the thought and let it know it's not the right time and place. Fighting or ignoring it makes this worse. It gets better with time.\n\nIf these are things that are a struggle to manage, a therapist that specializes in ADHD is the best resource to learn better ways to cope.",
