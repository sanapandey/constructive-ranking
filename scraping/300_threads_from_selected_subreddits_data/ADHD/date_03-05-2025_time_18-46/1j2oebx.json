            "body": "So far for me it kind of does. I've started on 30mg Elvanse and it had very good effect within the first 2-3 weeks but because of another issue i'm not allowed to up my dose yet which is a bummer also because 30mg is not as effective as it should be with my weight. I wish i could tell you more. One thing i can say though is that it does seem to reduce the amount of stress that usually comes from intrusive thoughts and impulses and tends to lock you into tasks that you happen to engage with while it kicks in.\n\nI personally feel like i could really capitalize on it if i made an effort to disengage more when it wears off. Because of course when the crash comes the risk of burnout comes back two-fold.",

It may help a lot, a bit, or not at all. If it does help, it may still not be worth it due to side effects or how expensive it is (depending on your medical coverage wherever in the world you are). That being said, statistically, for a majority of people, at least one of the meds available on the market (Elvanse, Conerta, Atomoxetine, etc.etc.) will work and provide some improvement. Conversely, if you don't feel like ADHD is a significant hurdle in your life and there are other things that help you (meditation, therapy, coffee, whatever), you may not need the meds at all.",
