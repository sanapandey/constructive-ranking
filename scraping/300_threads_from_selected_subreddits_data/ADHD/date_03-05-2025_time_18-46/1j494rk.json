    "selftext": "I\u2019m 22, got diagnosed with ADHD about 6 months ago, and I\u2019ve struggled with oral care and going to the dentist all my life- I had to get my baby front teeth removed at the age of 3 because they were so badly decayed. I pretty regularly get my teeth cleaned- every 6 months for the last couple of years; but I missed one cleaning appointment at the start of last year. Needless so say my latest appointment did not come with good news- I have cavities in basically every tooth, and was told by the dentist some are so badly decayed that she might not be able to fill it in and I will need a root canal. So far I have gone for 4 appointments and have 2 appointments left to get them hopefully fixed. But I get such bad anxiety every time I need to go- what if my teeth is so bad I need a root canal, as well as bad anxiety the days following the filling- thinking about what I could have done better, overthinking about every negative sensation that my teeth give me.\n\nI brush my teeth at least once a day- I usually fall asleep on the couch before I\u2019m able to shower or brush at night and wake up at about 4-5 to do it. I guess I\u2019m just frustrated at how I let it get this bad- I haven\u2019t been the worst at making sure my teeth get cleaned, how did my last dentists not say anything, and what do I do from here? I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to lose all my teeth before my 30s ",

Of course I'm not you, but hopefully that takes some little bit of the edge off.  \n\nYou might just be dentally cursed, too.  Some folks get the short end of that stick and even if they do everything 'right', they're gonna need a lot of work.  Don't get too down on yourself.\n\n\nThis next part is just me being inquisitive, if it's triggering or upsetting, let me know and I'll delete.\n\n\nDo you floss?  My dental assistant says that's as important as brushing.",

I\u2019m also really young and would like to keep my teeth. \n\nI floss here and there, often put it away because it stresses me out- but I\u2019m starting to floss regularly now.",
