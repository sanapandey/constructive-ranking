    "selftext": "My symptoms are worst during social situations where I will lose track of my train of thought causing the conversation to derail. Also, I find it hard to remember specific details from conversations because I get distracted so easily. Other times however I feel mentally sluggish and my brain is blank with no thoughts making it hard to actually reply to people and engage in a conversation. So I'm wondering, which medications have helped you the most in this regard? My social relationships are suffering because I find it difficult to actually maintain them.",

I have not tried other ADHD meds besides that. I have ADHD and Severe type 2 Narcolepsy, and that medication helps me a lot.",

My brain just like will wake up at 3am and is ready to look at random stuff or whatever which makes me take my morning Adderal sooner.\n\nBut, the guanfacine (prob not spelled right) kind of feels like a mood stabilizer? My doctor said he prescribes it for something else ADHD related besides sleep but I can\u2019t remember the exact name for it but it deals with emotions. Basically, even before I started taking Adderal I just felt irritable randomly. Like my emotions felt out of wack. Or I would think worst case scenarios and I guess I\u2019d be more sensitive to things even though logically I shouldn\u2019t be. Adderal has helped ease a lot of that, but I still had days where I\u2019d feel a pinch of anxiety and the irritable/mood swings. The guanfacine basically erases that for me. I\u2019ve only been on it for like a month but I seriously feel like my relationships have dramatically improved. I feel more social and don\u2019t get irritated that much. It\u2019s more like what I would assume a normal person would experience as far as getting irritated. But even then it\u2019s not extreme like it used to be. I feel like my confidence is actually improving too bc I feel like I can interact with people better and I can trust myself more. Also my blood pressure is finally normal too. \n\nI was originally prescribed clonidine(not sure about spelling) for sleep but, all the rare side effects that comes with it, I ended up getting. Clonidine is I guess supposed to like be similar to guanfacine. \n\nHope that helps! :)",
