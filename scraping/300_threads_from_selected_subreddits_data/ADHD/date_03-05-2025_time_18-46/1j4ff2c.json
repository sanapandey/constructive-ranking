    "selftext": "Ill talk to my doctor about it but is this uncommon? Feels like i never took anything atp but when i dont take it the adhd symptoms are even stronger. Would the doctor switch me to not rx? Or maybe higher dose or might i try a different medication overall? It worked very well the first few days and I was grateful but I want to get back to there. Yes i am taking breaks and not taking any on weekends.",

            "body": "You may need a higher dose or a different med. but there will always be a different feeling the first few days you\u2019re on something for the first time (or for the first time in a while). Taking ADD meds long term, you stop getting the euphoria, the feeling of superpowers, the hyperfocus, and it instead just balances you out a bit so you can keep on track more. I think people often chase the feeling of the first few weeks but you gotta remember the goal is to regulate your focus rather than transform your mental state. \n\nTLDR It\u2019s pretty typical to feel a difference after the first few days, just talk to your doctor.",
