    "selftext": "I've been medicated with both XR and IR for about three years now and while I've had to make tweaks and adjustments to dosage and all that, I feel like I've consistently noticed that different tasks feel easier to accomplish with XR or IR? \n\nWhenever I take my XR meds, it feels easier to complete or focus on tasks that involve a lot of mental work, like academic assignments or research or tasks for work. Really just anything that needs a lot of critical thinking. When I take my IR meds, it still feels easier than it would be to do those things unmedicated, just not as easy as with XR. Instead, with my IR, I'm almost always able to do tasks that aren't necessarily long-term like mental work tasks--so chores, cleaning, running errands, etc are always a breeze for me to start with my IR. \n\n  \nObviously there's exceptions to this and it's not 100% all the time, but pretty regular enough that I've noticed this!
