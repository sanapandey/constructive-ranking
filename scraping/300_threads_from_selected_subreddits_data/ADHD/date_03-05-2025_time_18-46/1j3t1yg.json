I was wondering how did it work for you (did it work to begin with? \ud83d\ude05)? And if you also took stimulants, how does it differ from this? \n\nI think it\u2019s worth to mention that I\u2019m the inattentive type. \n\n\nThank you very much ",

My doc said getting started on meds can be a little trial and error. I also have anxiety and take meds for it, so it didn\u2019t exacerbate my anxiety at all. Conversely, it dramatically improved. I would encourage you to identify some stress reducing activities you love (walking, cooking, whatever!) and plan them throughout your first week of taking meds. That\u2019s way, you\u2019ve already got stress reduction planned in your week and you don\u2019t have to even think about it when (but hopefully if) your anxiety builds up. \n\nWishing you all the best!!",

Now I can start tasks without discomfort??? Im in my 30s and have been experiencing this my whole life, to finally be free of it is so freeing.  I feel so much at ease.\n\nI also deal with really bad impulse control as a part of my adhd. And that mainly shows itself through me blabbering and oversharing and interrupting , interjecting. I felt like I was an onlooker listening to my own mouth speak out loud. Sometimes, I am oversharing things I know I shouldn;t and I keep mentally pressing the \" stop\" button but I can't stop and I have to cringe as I watch myself say embarassing things. I hated that Now can actually choose what I do, and sa instead of be a passive person in my experience at the mercy of my impulses. I have so much more control.  I was always late all the time to everything  because my  paralysis and distractibility, was really kicking my ass .Now i am always early and am super well planned and organized. I'm  insanely grateful and also a little sad? I guess I wonder who/what I could have been if I was diagnosed and took straterra when I was in my teens or my 20s.\n\n  \nETA: Yes, I tried stimulants. Stimulants exacerbated my anxiety, and made me bitchy, shaky, and my impulse control was still running amok, I was more productive on stimulants than without them, but it just made me so stressed and tense, and easily irratable. Coffee does the same for me too. Straterra gives me none of that. just ease, control, with every day things and no side effects.",

Start with a methylphenidate based medication like Ritalin, Concerta or Focalin, which should be fine unless you have severe ADHD. If you have severe ADHD, consider an amphetamine based medication like Adderall, Dexedrine, or Mydayis. Hope this helps! If you\u2019re in between the two tiers, try Vyvanse.",

            "body": "Combined type here. Been on strattera/atomoxetine for maybe 5 months. Had some not great side effects for around a month and then they mostly went away. What remains that I can think of is i have dry mouth issues a lot and im not a fan of the elevated heart beat. Also, I need make sure to take it on a full stomach otherwise it makes me super sick. Its pretty good overall and definitely superior to not having anything. Adderall was more intense and effective overall but it made my appetite go away so I could not eat anymore. Atomoxetine is more chill and subtle, but I've been able to do major life things that I couldn't in the past so it is a net benefit. I feel like, super level, and if i get out of wack, I can find my way back to level easier than without meds. Getting out of bed and going to bed is still an epic struggle though!",

            "body": "In general, my experience with atomoxetine is that, for me, it's *just okay*. \n\nI tried atomoxetine as combination therapy with methylphenidate, hoping that it would cover the weaknesses of methylphenidate(which for me were rough pre-med mornings, rough weekends, as I don't take meds on the weekend). As my mornings are so rough, I liked the idea of a 24/7 continuous effect, which was the main promise of an SNRI as compared to a stimulant.\n\nThe benefits weren't really there. I'm mainly inattentive-type ADHD and my impression of atomoxetine was that it mostly improved the hyperactive-impulsive part of ADHD. I felt calmer, more emotionally stable, more capable of calmly sitting in place - but that's not my main issue. My main issue is executive dysfunction and atomoxetine did little to alleviate it. It helps a bit, but not enough to justify it.\n\nWe titrated the dose with my psychiatrist very slowly, but even so, I found that at certain points, I'd get ED issues. Those issues eventually resolved, so I think there's a your-body-gets-used-to-it kind of effect, but it's a very frustrating experience as I'm sure you can imagine. I'm confident I'm a fast metabolizer of atomoxetine(the aforementioned issues would last a few hours after ingestion) so it overall didn't feel like I'm was getting a 24/7 kind of continuous effect either.\n\nThe end result was that taking it gave me results I'd compare to a smidgen more stimulant, at a far higher cost in terms of money and side effects, with none of the promised upsides and the effects were similarly short-acting.\n\nIf I didn't have any other choice, I'd take atomoxetine over nothing at all, but I overall found it to be very mid and disappointing compared to what I hoped I'd get out of it.",

Life is a lot better than it used to be, but now that I have finally accessed treatment through the NHS, I'm giving stimulant meds a shot, to see if my symptoms can be further mitigated. I opted for a private diagnosis and started private treatment about months after (yeah I don't know why I continued to tough it out either...). I was originally prescribed Ato due to my previous history of substance use; lots of amphetamines in my youth, Ebenezer Good xD and due to the expense of private consultations and scripts, I couldn't afford another 3 months of titration on stimulant meds.\n\nAll things being well, I'll be starting my new program tomorrow; two weeks lisdex and two weeks dex, followed by titration on the most effective/least worst side effects option.\n\nI took Dexedrine as a study aid in my final year of uni and it's probably the main reason I was able to scrape through with a 2:2 after failing first year and barely passing my second...I should have tried to get a diagnosis shortly thereafter, but stigma/labels/not wanting to be reliant on meds for the rest of my life :| I'm optimistic therefore that dex-based meds will be effective for me this time around!  \n  \nAto isn't bad, the side effects were few and far between; the worst I have is some intermittent wooziness in the afternoons (co morbid with the typical natural melanin peak  that causes the slump in us all!).\n\n  \nIf I remember/haven't lost my rag with social media, I'll report back on how I've been getting on :)\n\nWell done for getting diagnosed early and for (eventually) seeking treatment, I hope it works out for you and failing that, your healthcare profession is able to prescribe stimulants instead :)",
