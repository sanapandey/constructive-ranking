    "selftext": "Well it finally happened.....I ran out of ADHD meds  ( Ritalin) I had seen this happening and tried to send a message through the pt portal to let my pyschiatrist know. No phone call. I do this three more times and no phone call. I called yesterday and decided to schedule.....pyschiatrist cannot see me for a month.  All they can do is put me on standby but this means no meds for a month. I'm very upset and worried because I need these meds to do my job and function in daily society. \n\nI thought about going back to my primary care physician ( I was switched to the pyschiatrist while I was pregnant) and just getting back on Adderall. He has prescribed  this to me before.He does have a few openings so I wouldn't be out an entire month. I was told not to get meds from somebody else. It's not legal. \n\nI'm frustrated. I really feel like there is nothing that can be done and that no one cares if people go without their meds for a month. I'm very worried that my job will be in trouble. These meds have helped me so much at my job. \n\n\nIf anyone has any ideas on what to do just let me know. Thanks.\n\n\n",
