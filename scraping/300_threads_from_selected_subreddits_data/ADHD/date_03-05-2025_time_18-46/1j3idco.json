    "selftext": "Hey , is it just me or does anyone else has that issue where like they have to switch at least 5 different pens/pencils when writing something??? I use writing equipment A LOT, since Im a highschool student and i can only memorize things by writing them down on paper or whiteboard. That happens with both. When i suddenly feel too overwhelmed to write on paper i go to my whiteboard and even then use different markers every 5 minutes or so. This is kind of annoying me since im spending so much , both time and money since i need to buy new pens/markers every two weeks or so. This was way worse at the start of the school year because I used to switch between notebooks too, but I now have it under control since I only write on plain paper.",

Instead of pre-planning which colors to use for specific examples, I go with the flow, letting the text guide me. However, I do have a general pattern\u2014pink is reserved for the most impactful text since, as a girl, I feel drawn to it for emphasis. White is for very important information, ensuring it stands out as a core takeaway. I switch between blue, orange, and yellow to group other details, with blue often representing structured points, orange highlighting examples or applications, and yellow marking definitions or things I want to revisit. Continuously cycling through colors keeps my notes visually engaging and helps me process information faster. It\u2019s not a rigid system, but it works because it reflects how my brain naturally organizes thoughts.",
