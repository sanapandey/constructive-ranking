    "selftext": "For as long as I can remember I've had inattention issues, but never has it been as bad as it is now. I (21F) am a junior in college and I cannot for the life of me pay attention in any of my classes or get myself to sit down and do the work.\n\nSitting down with my assignments makes me feel like pulling teeth trying to sit through any kind of work. Like, I feel like I want to tear my skin apart rather than do the work. In fact, I feel like I'd rather do anything other than the work. It makes me so irrationally angry even just looking at it because it shouldn't feel this bad or this hard but it does and it's infuriating.\n\nDropping out isn't an option, I want to be a vet and I've already dropped thousands of dollars on my education. I'm really passionate when I'm working in the field, it's just the school part that is dragging me. \n\nI'm currently on 2mg of Guanfacine (Tenex) a non-stimulant, and my provider won't prescribe stimulants. I've tried two other non-stimulants without success. I'm trying to get a different provider for a second opinion but it isn't going well.\n\nI just- How does anyone else get through school? I will do practically anything at this point just to be able to function.",

If you can concentrate with music, have some music playing. Have a fun drink. Have a snack. It will help make the experience not so terrible.\u00a0\n\n\nAnother thing that's helped me is saying, \"I choose to,\" instead of \"I should\" or \"I need to.\" It helps my brain feel a little more motivated to do the task.\u00a0\n\n\nIf it helps, I don't really pay attention in classes either. I just read the textbook.\u00a0",

I took a test today without looking at the material for the first time until a few hours before the exam and got a 68 +/- 4pts. (not great but servicable)\n\nUnder the desk bike doesn't sound to bad? I guess it just depends on how expensive it is. But knowing me even if I decide it's a good idea I'll procrastinate getting one, just like everything else I need/want to buy.",
