    "selftext": "Hello everyone (Salam alaykum),\n\nI\u2019m struggling hard with my sleep and productivity during Ramadan, and I need advice.\n\nFor context, I have ADHD and usually take medication to stay focused, but since I\u2019ve been fasting for the past 3 days, I\u2019ve only taken them once. On top of that, my sleep schedule is a disaster\u2014I keep staying up until Fajr, sleeping right after, and waking up at 1\u20133 PM, which means I\u2019m missing my classes and getting nothing done.\n\nThe real problem is, I have a huge project due in one month, and I\u2019ve done 0% of it so far. Without my meds, I genuinely struggle to start anything, and I feel like I\u2019m completely falling apart. \n\nI think the only way to fix this is to fully sleep before Suhoor, wake up at 4:20 AM, and work after Fajr when my meds are still effective. But flipping my sleep schedule feels impossible when I\u2019m so used to staying up late.\n\nHas anyone successfully done this? How do I reset my sleep and actually stay productive while fasting? Any advice (or just encouragement) would help. I feel like I\u2019m drowning.\n\nJazakAllah khair in advance.\n\nEdit: I take elvanse 30mg, so it\u2019s an XR medication. ",

But whoever of you is ill or on a journey, then \u02f9let them fast\u02fa an equal number of days \u02f9after Rama\u1e0d\u00e2n\u02fa. For those who can only fast with extreme difficulty, compensation can be made by feeding a needy person \u02f9for every day not fasted\u02fa. But whoever volunteers to give more, it is better for them. And to fast is better for you, if only you knew.\n\n\n\n\n\nI myself am a prideful person and I despise the fact that I cannot fast as it makes me feel less in a way. Fasting also helps me a lot mentally to appreciate what I have, but I'm still not fasting because I'm a student and I need to finish my university studies (to do that I need meds taken at the proper times and adhere to a strict food and sleep schedule) so I can support my family in the future. I know that when I'm done with my studies I'll be able to find a job where I'll tell my boss each year that I'll be working slower for a month and not take my meds during Ramadan. But until I reach that point I'll have to suffer knowing I can't fast (nor donate because I'm poor, living on the bare minimum).\n\n\nEdit: English isn't my first language and I realized that \"forced\" had the wrong meaning, changed to obligated/advised.",

But until I reach that point I'll have to suffer knowing I can't fast (nor donate because I'm poor, living on the bare minimum)\n\nAlthough people who do suffer from medical conditions where it causes them bodily harm to fast are not allowed to fast (ex: Diabetes), having ADHD is not such a condition as you also affirm that if you weren't a student, you'd be able to adjust your lifestyle in order to be able to fast. And yes I am aware of the difficulty of studying while fasting without medication (I just had an exam this morning while fasting), but it is not something one can take as an excuse. This life is a test, and the most important test, and we cannot put worldly tests and exams above it.\n\nSo as a kind piece of advice, I strongly suggest that you still fast in this holy month and the additional struggle is something that is greatly rewarded by Allah, and *Whoever leaves something for Allah, Allah will substitute for him something much better*. \n\nMay Allah grant you guidance, and keep you steadfast",

What I mean is, we live in the present, the way my life looks makes it near impossible to fast. For near 12 years have I tried to study but continually failed because of executive dysfunction, I'm 30 and I can't lose any more time to adhd.\n\nIt's up to each and every muslim to make a judgement of their own situation, in my case I've reached the conclusion that if I don't do this I'll probably fall back into depression and not leave my bed again for the next 3 years. God has created our fates and God also told us to step away from a falling wall. \n\nWhen it comes to my advice to OP, they need to take a look at everything and come to a conclusion themselves as it is a part of the duty. But if this all creates enough of a problem in their life that everything gets turned upside down, then they're exempt from fasting.",

Most of them won't die, but some of them would have avoided that car accident if they had their meds. It's like telling someone suicidally depressed they don't need their meds either: most of them will make it through the month, but those meds are definately keeping some of them alive.\n\nYou can make your own judgements on your own behavior, but it is no exaggeration in the slightest to say meds are necessary to avoid bodily harm.",

I prefer the second routine because I get to be sharp for work. A lot of the other comments mention not fasting and that's an idea my therapist floated but personally didn't feel it necessary for me since I got through most of my life without them.
