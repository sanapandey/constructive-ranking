    "selftext": "Hello fellow ADHDers, I've (32M) been taking medication (Adderall XR) the last few months and have not found the right dosage for me. I started at 10mg twice a day and worked my way up to 20mg twice a day. I felt the mental clarity around noon, when my second dose was taken, but only for the short window of having 40mg in my system. Now I don't feel anything at all. Not only that, I'm reverting back to daytime drowsiness and hard time focusing. I told my doc this, but kept me on the same dosage. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, how did you get your medication to \"work\" again or did your doc change your medication?",

I starred at 10mg ER and went all the way to 30mg with an option 10mg booster for when I was dragging on the afternoon.  \n\nSo basically it could be you or it could be the dose.",

                            "body": "Regarding food, Adderall is susceptible to acids. So citric acid and other foods hurt effectiveness. Also a completely empty stomach can have a lot of stomach acid that might hurt. I change between 30mg Adderall XR or 40mg generic Vyvanse depending on what I need. (Breaks in between to prevent doubling up on the amphetamines)\n\nIf I'm taking the Adderall I usually take it with something alkaline like a half glass of almond milk or a banana. I also take a Turmeric pill which also helps effectiveness... Somehow... I don't know how, just that it actually does work and plenty of people swear by it. \n\nIf I'm on Vyvanse I don't care what I eat because it needs to break down anyways so it's not effected by acidic food. \nThe issue is citric acid is in EVERYTHING. I had to stop using certain brands of water flavorings because they had a lot of citric acid. If I've had something acidic either by mistake or lack of self control Ill take a Tums about 30 minutes before my dose. But that's a rarity because I don't want kidney stones",
