    "selftext": "Hey guys I was diagnosed with ADHD Combined this past July (M21).\n\nSince July I\u2019ve been on Strattera and I started off on the lowest dosage and worked my way up to 80 mg. I want to say that it worked a little bit for me, but I kept having nausea. My doctor just changed me to Wellbutrin XL 150mg. I\u2019ve never heard of anyone else taking this for ADHD so I was curious if you guys could provide your own personal feedback of the medication. ",
