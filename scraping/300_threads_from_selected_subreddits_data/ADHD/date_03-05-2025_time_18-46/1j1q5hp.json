Go back to sleep and wake up again half an hour later with the meds already in your system.\nAnother thing that works for me is unfortunately way less fun: take a shower. Take it as cold as you possibly can stand for as long as you can stand it. Trigger your mammalian diving reflex. You\u2019re gonna get at least a few hours of alert wakefulness from that.\nNext trick: Pain. There is a pressure point at the base of your thumb that will push you back from the brink of sleepiness if pressed hard enough and it is almost impossible to do any real damage that way.\nTiger Balm. I don\u2019t know if they have that where you are, but it is really useful if applied to the temples, neck and (lightly) inside of your nose. The smell as well as the freshness keep me alert quite well. Just be sure to wash your hands carefully, because if you get that stuff in your eyes, you\u2019re going to be REALLY awake for quite a long time.\n\nLastly, none of those tricks holds a candle to just getting the amount of sleep you actually need. I know you said in a different comment that you want to use as much of the day as you can, but are you really doing that if you\u2019re constantly tired? Try thinking quantity and quality. Get enough sleep and enjoy the rest of the day much more.",

Like others have said, it can be a great motivator just because it's tasty and warm and socially indicates morning, but you can actually build anything into a morning ritual and get similar results. It's hard, but the longer term effects of getting more regular sleep and working with your meds and learning what your baseline of energy is will serve you well for a long long time!",
