I have a new job but who knows how long it will last.\n\nThe truth is that I can't function without clear instructions, that is the reason why I suck at many jobs, funny enough I am very detailed oriented but I need a sense of guidance in order to be efficient and productive. I think that maybe joining the Canadian forces could bring some structure to my life. Am I insane or this could be a possibility?",
