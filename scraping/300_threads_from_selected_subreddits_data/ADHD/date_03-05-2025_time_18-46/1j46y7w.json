    "selftext": "I\u2019m not sure if this needs a TW with food/eating disorders but I suppose it could be triggering for some. \n\n\nI don\u2019t have an eating disorder or I don\u2019t think I do..I mean I think I would know right? Anyway I go through these weird patches every few months where I\u2019m literally repulsed by food or certain foods to the point of gagging and nausea. It comes out of nowhere and it\u2019s not something that I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m thinking of for it to happen, if that makes sense. In other words it\u2019s not intentional. I\u2019ll start to lose weight and it\u2019s a whole thing because I have struggled with losing too much during these patches of time. And it takes forever to get back to my normal weight. Right now it\u2019s chicken. Any kind. Can\u2019t do it. Period. Then last night started happening with beef. So now I\u2019m down to what?? Pork????\ud83d\ude44 it\u2019s driving me absolutely insane and I can feel myself starting to lose weight and that scares me. It\u2019s making me feel like I\u2019m losing my mind and I just don\u2019t know if this is a normal adhd thing or what. ",
