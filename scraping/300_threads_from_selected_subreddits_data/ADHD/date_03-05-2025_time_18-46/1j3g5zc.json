    "selftext": "Even if you get the cheaper ones, a vacuum mopping robot can really help. We got one for convenience, so I don\u2019t have to worry about the floors as much. It\u2019s helped me in two big ways!\n\n**1. A Body Double for Cleaning**  \nWhen I need to clean a room, I order the vacuum to clean too. It makes it feel like a game, trying to beat the robot or clean fast enough so it picks up stuff I drop. It\u2019s like having a partner to help.\n\n**2. Less Clutter Stress**  \nI don\u2019t know why, but coming home to clean floors makes the house feel so much tidier. Even if there\u2019s still clutter, vacuumed and polished floors instantly make it feel better. I always noticed this when I came back from a trip. Clean floors gave me satisfaction and helped me relax.\n\nThe robot doesn\u2019t do deep cleaning, but it saves me hours. In the two weeks we\u2019ve had it, it\u2019s been great for picking up dirt and cat litter. For someone with ADHD like me, it helps a lot. I don\u2019t get stuck thinking about how dirty the floors are every time I walk into a room for something else. This might be most helpful for people who tend to look down a lot, like me!\n\n---\n\nEDIT This version uses shorter sentences and sections, making it easier to follow.  I used CHATGPT to summarize my text as I tend to babble but read much shorter stuff better",

It can't really deal with carpets, or wires of any kind, can't really do anything useful unless your house is robovac-proofed. And then it's still slow and noisy, better to just use an actual vacuum cleaner and be done in a few minutes.",
