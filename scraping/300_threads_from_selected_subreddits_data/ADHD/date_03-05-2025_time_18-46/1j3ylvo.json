    "selftext": "I really struggle to remember to do things and although apple reminders sometimes work, I\u2019ve had a few big reminders sitting there for months now and I don\u2019t have the motivation to do them. There are also basic things like eating and drinking that I forget to do due to poor interoception.\n\nMy question is are there any apps out there that people know of that have helped people with this problem. I was thinking maybe gamifying reminders e.i. slowly collecting virtual shiny things as I tick them off or building a small virtual city. Something silly like that that might play more to my game centred brain.\n\nAny and all suggestions are welcome I would love to get on top of this finally!",

You can set up timed notifications for your tasks, it tracks your streak, and every task you do gives you points to buy items for your little bird (clothes, furniture & decorations, things like that). They also have a good list of suggested tasks when you first start using the app, so it\u2019s really easy to set up. I\u2019m currently on a 70 day streak! I started using it to remind me of basic self-care tasks, but now I use it to remind me of work tasks and basically anything I have to do.\n\nYour bird gains energy as you check the tasks off your list. Once it reaches full energy, you send them on an adventure and they will return a few hours later with a new discovery and a little dialogue about it. You reply to your bird & it develops personality traits based on your reply!\n\nThey also have a lot of reflection prompts, breathing exercises and other self-care related things in the app too. I\u2019ve found myself using them more recently and it\u2019s been pretty helpful for my mental health, whereas before I probably would\u2019ve written them off as a waste of time. \n\nBut yeah, I definitely recommend giving Finch a try if you\u2019re looking to gamify your reminders! :)",
