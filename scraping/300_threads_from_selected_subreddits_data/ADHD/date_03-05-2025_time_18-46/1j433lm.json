    "selftext": "Hello, this is my first post here. Little introduction, I got diagnosed with adhd when I was 13-14yro. I\u2019ve never taken medication because my mom never wanted me to take it so I had to switch 3 schools and learn to cope without. Went in uni and studied biology (which I love) and came out with a first degree with the struggle. \n\nJust a question, I just want to see if other people relate. On nights out when I have a pint or two, and then go to a club everything numbs out and sort of feels like it\u2019s just me and the club. I don\u2019t enjoy clubs because of this, is this because of adhd or am I just stupid? \n",
