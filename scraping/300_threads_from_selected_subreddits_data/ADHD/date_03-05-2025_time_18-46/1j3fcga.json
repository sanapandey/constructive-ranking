    "selftext": "So yeah this is partially a humble brag. I feel proud that I naturally and through my own process of trial and error am already doing anything and everything any professional would help teach me to function in day to day life.  \n\nNow look. I had no idea this was ADHD. I was told back in 1999 my ADD was gone, cured, I grew out of it.  \n\nSo I have gone through the past 25 years of my life assuming I am just naturally lazy, forgetful, etc. You all know the drill here. I just saw areas I was failing and found ways to fix it or pivot to do thing differently.\n\nYeah. ADHD pattern recognition and problem solving for the win. It did feel nice getting those constant pats on the back and shock and awe from various professionals I had figured it out on my own. It really did.\n\nBut I am also just sort of sad there is not more I am missing. Really? What thousands of medical professionals came up with. With millions of ADHD... sufferers? discovered I did all of that and there is nothing more all of these people figured out?\n\nEssentially all this diagnosis got me was validation and confirmation... Which was HUGE and brought me to tears learning this. It really helped a ton finally having something to point at and say. \"Wow, that is why I am so MASSIVLY different.\"   \n\nBut beyond that, there is not any additional assistance I could be offered or tricks I can be taught.  \n\nNow to be clear. I am still working with a doc to potentially get on medication. As it seems that is the next tool available to me. (I am just dragging my feet for no reason other than I don't feel like scheduling another appointment.) \n\nBut I also pose this question to others like me.   \n\nHas anyone else ran into this in other areas of life, hobbies, jobs. You walk in and can see ALL of the issues in minutes. And find out it took everyone else years or decades to discover them? What were they? Tell me about them. Vent and/or brag.",

You look at a project and in minutes see what is wrong with it, but it takes everyone else weeks or month of working on the project to encounter the issue.\n\nSorry yeah just me being bad at typing out what i mean there. I thought I was clear when i said \"Other areas in life, hobbies, or jobs.\" Any thoughts on how I can clean that sentence up for it to make sense in the way I want?",

So when something is incorrect or incongruous we notice it immediately. \n\n\u201cNormal\u201d people accept those same inconsistencies. It means they fit into groups better, but we can reason better.",

            "body": "After my initial diagnosis, I've had a hard time getting support from other medical providers... which sucks cuz I've since moved to a different city. I was in therapy for a long time before, for anxiety/depression, so I had a lot of regulatory tools established. Because meds weren't very effective (maybe I just need a combo of meds for depression and ADHD), I also applied a bunch of other tools/resources to manage myself.\n\n\nAnd honestly, it's not too bad, most days. It helps that my partner and friends are very patient and supportive. I'm not in distress every single day, and I'm not a huge burden on my gf. I'm way more chaotic, forgetful, and clumsy. My gf says I'm a bit more squirrelly without medication, and I'm probably more quick to tire, having to keep up with a routine that my whole being wants to push back against.\n\n\n2 out of 3 psychiatrists that I've seen fully dismissed the possibility that I have ADHD. But also, how do I prove to people that my normal every day is unlike most people? I'm so used to having certain steps or routines in play, that I don't think so much about it any more. The moment I stop using those tools, things fall apart. How do I explain my difficulty with emotional regulation in a way that doesn't just seem like anxiety? How do I explain that I pay attention to the wrong things, or that I get stuck in a loop? How do I stop masking in a doctor's office?!\n\n\nGah. The struggle of adults with ADHD.",

It was more in the spirit that: \u201cyou probably used your capacity to the max to find ways to compensate and the approaches and tricks that are usually taught are not useful to you\u201d.\n\nI felt that meds have helped. Not in the immediate way that they are usually described, but through years of use and trying to improve routines. I feel that I can make choices on meds that were not available to me earlier. Time and meds. Sounds underwhelming.",
