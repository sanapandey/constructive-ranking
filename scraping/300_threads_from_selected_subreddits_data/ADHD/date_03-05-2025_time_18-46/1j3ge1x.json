    "selftext": "I\u2019ve had a recent big life event happen for me that really derailed me emotionally and thus is exasperating my ADHD symptoms (I think lol). \n\nOne of the biggest symptoms I\u2019m noticing and has not really been too much of a bother for me before now, is irritability. I am so annoyed and irritated by everything! And my mood is so heavily affected by it! \n\nFor example, I just realized I forgot my fitness tracking watch and I was really looking forward to seeing how it would track my activity at my workout this afternoon. The realization I forgot it sent me into this massive (internal) rage. I just sat here at my desk clutching my fists as tight as possible and holding back the urge to scream at the top of my lungs and slam my desk. That\u2019s a crazy reaction towards something so small, so the fact that it irritates me, then irritates me even more! A never ending cycle of irritation it feels like.\n\nI HATE feeling like this, so does anyone have any tips on how to regulate this emotion a bit better? I am so aware of how insane my reactions to these small situations are and it frustrates me even further. \n\nI think, sort of related, I have a hard time letting myself feel ANY emotion without feeling guilt or beating myself up, so do I just need to let myself feel these emotions??? Idk. Something I need to ask my therapist I guess lol.",
