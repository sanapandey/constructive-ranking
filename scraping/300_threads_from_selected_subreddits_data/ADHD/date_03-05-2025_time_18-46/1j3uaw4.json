I take Dex during the day, but I bounce back from it hard and come crashing down after work. And to make it way worse, I'm constantly doom scrolling or watching something on YouTube, and I get stuck in the loop and then end up feeling way worse, just completely zapped, and cannot get excited at all about making anything. \n\nSuppose I'm wondering if anyone else feels this way? It might be executive dysfunction, but I'm not sure I know enough to be confident about that. ",

I can come up with amazing story ideas, write outlines and such, but when it comes down to actually writing the story/chapters, I have nothing or it just sounds so awful. \n\nI also have 2 toddlers now, so any free time I have is literally sleeping or unfortunately doom scrolling or trying to get daily chores done. I keep telling myself I\u2019ll try to write again when they are school-aged. lol\n\nI\u2019ve also noticed that the \u2018fun\u2019 or \u2018novelty\u2019 goes away once I do sit down to actually try to write. It seems more like a chore at that point unlike coming up with the ideas. \n\nWhen I was in high school, I did actually post stories on fanfiction .net. Idk if that\u2019s still a thing, but I think I may try to do that again because perhaps that won\u2019t feel like a chore. It\u2019ll be more lighthearted and fun. Maybe once I can exercise my writing muscles with stories I can\u2019t self publish (like changing up a movie or the characters or something and just using that as a writing exercise to post on the website) then maybe I\u2019ll be better equipped to really write and maybe self-publish. \n\nIdk if there\u2019s a way to do that with music though.",

So I\u2019m more likely to write a fanfic if I\u2019ve been reading them. I hope music would be similar, consume what you enjoy in your spare time until it fills you with enough motivation to make your own!",

I don't consider stimulants a recreational drug especially considering art because it's not a true definer of what it allows the brain to consider.\n\nIf people were unable to move past that logic. I could still argue that most. If not all art is made with tender and considerate persons. If we work around contours and repetition this is still lackluster argument.\n\nAnyways I can say people struggling with medication inefficiency can hamper their ability to stay consistent long-term. Fortunately we can find comfort that technology and art are always advancing together so we grow.",

Undergoing the lengthy pursuit of an ADHD-I diagnosis currently and have had my referral accepted. \n\nI have days during my 9-5 where I'm tremendously uninspired and unmotivated, with work I'm not really happy with or just social media graphics which are single use and effectively the fast food of marketing.\n\nOne thing that's helped me is having a \"dedicated\" slot of 8pm until 10pm where my headphones are in, phone is in a drawer or off, my girlfriend is aware what it's for etc. That way I can cook/eat dinner beforehand then have it entirely focused, whilst reading in bed after.\n\n2 hours a few times a week really compounds. Breaking it down into a small attainable chunk like this makes it more user friendly, less daunting, and helps it add up rather than being a huge mountain in front of you.\n\nGood luck!",

Especially with all the stress from real life, I found it hard to focus on hobbies and put some work into them\n\nWould really love to find a way back to them!!",

I have a million things in various states of progress due to this.\n\nWhat sometimes helps me get the excitement and motivation back is actually to watch a YouTube video of someone doing that thing. Like if I have a sculpture I want to finish, I'll do something else while watching a video of someone sculpting, and eventually I start wanting to do that. It's not foolproof, but it's helped me a few times.",
