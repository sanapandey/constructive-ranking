As I took a moment to gather my answer he laughed and said \"hahahha you don't even know!!\" Walked away laughing \ud83d\ude02 anyways I know my coworker is from Macedonia. I tried looking into some brief political history but still left confused lol is it just typical western propaganda that got his ass? Is there any valid beef there \n\nFunny enough that same day another coworker complimented the tattoo ",

            "body": "Che was a complicated person who made racist and homophobic comments, and was a product of his time and culture, like everyone else. He also took a third world banana republic country that was oppressed by the USA, and established housing, universal healthcare and education for all. You can criticize him as some utopian that didn\u2019t have a grasp on central planning, yet he is symbol for oppressed peoples worldwide. He was definitely not the murderous tyrant Western capitalists made him out to be.\n\nPeople say he was evil because he executed some of the old government officials and supporters of Bautista, and some of his own men who refused to follow orders, or sold out to the enemy. What revolutionary army wouldn\u2019t do this, though?\n\nThe USA can murder women and children in drone strikes and supply weapons for Israel for genocide, and we\u2019re the \u201cgood guys\u201d who stand for freedom? This isn\u2019t evil? The hypocrisy of the bourgeoisie brainwashing is astounding.\n\nMuch of the criticism of Che comes from bourgeois escapees of Castro\u2019s government, after their resorts, luxury cars, assets and yachts were seized by the revolutionary government.",

It\u2019s a ridiculous right-wing argument. Che was human and it\u2019s stupid to make heroes of anyone, including the founding fathers. As uncomfortable as it makes you, Che improved Cuba from what it was. He also gave hope to everyone who is oppressed under capitalism. No one is arguing he\u2019s morally superior to anyone else. He killed people in the process of revolution. Remember the French Revolution and what happened to the royals and nobility? Oppress people and they will be out for blood. Che probably helped spare some lives during the Cuban revolution, as the people were out for blood. He was also deeply conflicted about some of the executions.\n\nLiberals fear violent revolution, and we will probably never see true change without it. Liberals who fear revolution fear losing their own affluence and lifestyle in a takeover of the proletariat. Liberals are really just petit bourgeois with college educations and talk progressive politics at cocktail parities. As long as the bourgeois exists and has the power to control politicians, nothing gets done.",

            "body": "When I was in college back in the day, a girl in my bio lab had the Korda Che tattoo on her arm. I was studying Latin American history, which I now teach, so I asked what Che meant to her. \"I just thought it looked cool.\" Here I was thinking I had a cool radical girl for a lab partner, but I kinda lost interest after that.\n\nKorda's photo is a wonderful image but one that has come resonate with the fashionable left more as social archetype than as memory of the man himself, a Marxist revolutionary dedicated to working class mobilization on a global scale and the end of capitalist repression. He was a very complicated man with many flaws, not only in his rightly criticized use of violence (in some contexts, anyway, and more how he used it than that he did) but also, like any revolutionary of the left and most especially Lenin, his hubristic belief in his own abilities and his understanding of things, and from that, an inability to bend his Marxist ethos, which for Marx was never so doctrinaire, to the complexities of life. But, to be fair, he was trying to accomplish something that even Marx was never able to fully articulate in his lifetime, and with all the power of global capitalism against him. \n\nTo me, that's what that picture *should* mean: a symbol of man who was quite ordinary save for his keen sense of observation and empathy that led him into a lifelong revolutionary commitment to the working poor, a commitment for which he was willing to give his life as he ultimately did, knowing full well that it would fall to future generations to carry forward the struggle.\n\nSo, in a way, that picture has sadly become commodified, as all things do under capitalism, as an emblem of social leftists devoid of true leftist class sentiments and revolutionary motivations. I'm not saying that's what it means to you, to be clear but it will be read by most as an empty symbol or, in this case, by liberals a relic of someone who was just a \"bad person\" and nothing more, thus dismissing both Che and his movement in hollow moral terms. This is absurd, of course, since nearly every \"hero\" of liberalism had way more blood on their hands than Che. George Washington was not only an enslaver but also a land speculator and profiteer of Indigenous genocide, but hardly anyone would look at his image on a shirt and say, \"hey, you think he was really a good guy?\" No, actually, I don't. He was a monster.\n\nIf you haven't read it, Jon Lee Anderson's classic biography of Che is amazing and really captures his complexity and his development and radicalization from very unlikely and inauspicious beginnings.",

Yes Ernesto was one of a kind, but guess what? So are you, so am I and so is each and everyone of us. I can\u2019t remember the exact quote but his brother in his book \u00ab\u00a0Mi hermano el Che\u00a0\u00bb said that he highly disliked people idolizing his brother because it dehumanized him and made him and his life an unattainable ideal. One of the core ideas in Che\u2019s ideology was \u00ab\u00a0el hombre nuevo\u00a0\u00bb (his version of Nietzsche\u2019s \u00fcbermensch imo), a person who reforges themselves to be a good person, a good revolutionary and be the vanguard of a new version of mankind that will not need nor want to exploit each other. This is not an undertaking for demigods or exceptional, once in a century people this is a task for normal people, to better themselves and align their values with their reality. \n\nAs an old revolutionary I met told me when I was very young and wearing a Che shirt \u00ab\u00a0Stop wearing his face on your clothes and start covering your heart and mind with his ideas\u00a0\u00bb (it does not translate great from spanish to english but this phrase stuck to me)",
