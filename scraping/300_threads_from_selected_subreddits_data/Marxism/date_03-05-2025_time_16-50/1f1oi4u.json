    "selftext": "I've got a question from Lenin's  \n\"The Impending Catastrophe and How to Combat It\"   \nIn it he says \"For socialism is merely the next step forward from state-capitalist monopoly. Or, in other words, socialism is merely state-capitalist monopoly which is made to serve the interests of the whole people and has to that extent ceased to be capitalist monopoly.\"   \n  \nI'm confused on why Lenin is saying that socialism is state-Capitalist Monopoly serving the \"people\". Is that not just a bourgeois form of socialism? Doesn't that contradict the Marxian form of socialism from both \"*critique of the Gotha program*\" and Lenin's own \"*The state and revolution*\" i.e, socialism just being the first phase of communist society but with bourgeois law still in place? \n\n",

The state is inherently coercive by nature. In a capitalist society, the state serves as an instrument of the bourgeoisie. In a socialist society, it is an instrument of the proletariat. As long as the state still exists, there still exists some form of class conflict in society. Lenin is acknowledging this fact.\n\nSocialism does retain some \"capitalist\" tendencies in that it is still a society where the state, money, and class exist. However, it is a society that serves the people (the proletariat), as opposed to a privileged few (the bourgeoise).",

So it became a dictatorship of the party and the party became bureaucrats rather than the organising body of the vanguard of class consciousness revolutionary workers.",

Second Lenin says\n\n> The state withers away insofar as there are no longer any capitalists, any classes, and, consequently, no class can be suppressed. But the state has not yet completely withered away, since the still remains the safeguarding of \"bourgeois law\", which sanctifies actual inequality. For the state to wither away completely, complete communism is necessary.\n\nAlso \n\n> In its first phase, or first stage, communism cannot as yet be fully mature economically and entirely free from traditions or vestiges of capitalism. Hence the interesting phenomenon that communism in its first phase retains \"the narrow horizon of bourgeois law\". Of course, bourgeois law in regard to the distribution of consumer goods inevitably presupposes the existence of the bourgeois state, for law is nothing without an apparatus capable of enforcing the observance of the rules of law. It follows that under communism there remains for a time not only bourgeois law, but even the bourgeois state, without the bourgeoisie!\n\nSo, by this point class is gone which means class struggle has ended but inequality still exists and complete Communism is necessary for the final remnants of the state to wither away. \n\nUnless I'm misreading something there",

Russia failed to move past state capitalism into socialism basically\u2026 State capitalism itself being a last resort method. \n\nSocialism and communism are typically used interchangeably in the writings of Marx and Lenin as they are considered the same project especially because socialism did not have the same connotations to the average proletariat of social democracy. They are aren\u2019t actually distinctly codified except loosely in a few places where both use it to delineate the two phases of communism - the lower and higher, and what this looks like. The lower, socialism, begins where all the trappings of bourgeoisie society still exist but the proletariat have political control with the dictatorship of the proletariat. This progresses as commodity production is abolished, classes begin to cease having meaning and the state withers away as it is no longer needed. It\u2019s not immediate so to some extent the spectre of capitalism haunts the new dictatorship of the proletariat in its economic structure and in the minds of workers. \nThe state is an organ of class rule. It has no purpose other than enforcing the rule of the ruling class. A ruling class assumes other classes still existing",

He recognizes that in that specific point in time, especially with the sabotage and undermining of the Bolshevik efforts, he has to suggest measures that were at yhe momeny being implemented even in bourgeois nations, like Germany.",
