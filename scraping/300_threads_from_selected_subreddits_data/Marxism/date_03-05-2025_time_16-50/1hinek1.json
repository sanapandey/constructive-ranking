    "selftext": "So, my job (where I\u2019m definitely overworked and underpaid) just launched a monthly \"book\" club. The idea is to read a book or listen to a podcast and discuss it together. February is my turn to pick, and I'm struggling to find the right thing.\n\nHere's the thing: My employers are all Trump supporters, and while I\u2019d love to pick something that subtly critiques how poorly employees are treated under capitalism, I don't want it to come across as overtly anti-capitalist and get dismissed out of hand. I want something that sparks conversation and (hopefully) gets them to reflect on how they manage the workplace\u2014but without immediately setting off any red flags.\n\nAnything that feels insightful, not preachy, and ideally not too long (because let\u2019s be real, I\u2019m also juggling a million other tasks).\n\nAnyone have recommendations?\u00a0",

Most cosmere governments are your standard feudal nobility, but Mistborn is unique in that they will be mirroring real world technology with era 3 as a retro modern society and 4 as space age. There were a couple points in 2 where it was clear capitalist industrialization was the root of the problem and people got close to reaching the right conclusion, but liberals always won in the end. For example, Bleeder harnessed the grievances of the working class against their capitalist elite but in the end Brando hand waved it saying \"oh, terrorism bad. Listen to the liberals\" And then we hear nothing further on it.\n\n\nIt's funny because everyone in my party (marxist) reads Brandon and we're always discussing what we read and our fan theories. We're always getting comrades to start the series",

Assuming that the income Inequality that characterized the end of the 19th century had disappeared, Bellamy employs a fascinating metaphor of a stagecoach to try to explain to the folks in the 21st century how fucked up it was that the rich ignorantl lorded their life over the poor. As we think critically about the murdered health insurance CEO, maybe Bellamy's metaphor will drive the point home: At the beginning of the book Looking Backward, Bellamy writes:\n\nBy way of attempting to give the reader some general impression of the way people lived together in those days, and especially of the relations of the rich and poor to one another, perhaps I cannot do better than to compare society as it then was to a prodigious coach which the masses of humanity were harnessed to and dragged toil-somely along a very hilly and sandy road. The driver was hunger, and permitted no lagging, though the pace was necessarily very slow.\nDespite the difficulty of drawing the coach at all along so hard a road, the top was covered with passengers who never got down, even at the steepest ascents. These seats on top were very breezy and comfortable. Well up out of the dust, their occupants could enjoy the scenery at their leisure, or critically discuss the merits of the straining team. Naturally such places were in great demand and the competi-tion for them was keen, every one seeking as the first end in life to secure a seat on the coach for himself and to leave it to his child aft discuss the merits of the straining team. Naturally such places were in great demand and the competi-tion for them was keen, every one seeking as the first end in life to secure a seat on the coach for himself and to leave it to his child after him. By the rule of the coach a man could leave his seat to whom he wished, but on the other hand there were many accidents by which it might at any time be wholly lost. For all that they were so easy, the seats were very insecure, and at every sudden jolt of the coach persons were slipping out of them and falling to the ground, where they were instantly compelled to take hold of the rope and help to drag the coach on which they had before ridden so pleasantly. It was naturally regarded as a terrible misfortune to lose one\u2019s seat, and the appre-hension that this might happen to them or their friends was a constant cloud upon the happiness of those who rode.\nBut did they think only of themselves? you ask. Was not their very luxury rendered intolerable to them by comparison with the lot of their brothers and sisters in the harness, and the knowledge that their own weight added to their toil? Had they no compassion for fellow beings from whom fortune only distinguished them? Oh, yes;\ncommiseration was frequently expressed by those who rode for those who had to pull the coach, especially when the vehicle came to a bad place in the road, as it was constantly doing, or to a particu-larly steep hill. At such times, the desperate straining of the team, their agonized leaping and plunging under the pitiless lashing of hunger, the many who fainted at the rope and were trampled in the mire, made a very distressing spectacle, which often called forth highly creditable displays of feeling on the top of the coach. At such times the passengers would call down encouragingly to the toilers of the rope, exhorting them to patience, and holding out hopes of possible compensation in another world for the hardness of their lot, while others contributed to buy salves and liniments for the crippled and injured. It was agreed that it was a great pity that the coach should be so hard to pull, and there was a sense of general relief when the specially bad piece of road was gotten over. This relief was not, indeed, wholly on account of the team, for there was always some danger at these bad places of a general overturn in which all would lose their seats.\nIt must in truth be admitted that the main effect of the spectacle of the misery of the toilers at the rope was to enhance the passengers\u2019 sense of the value of their seats upon the coach, and to cause them to hold on to them more desperately than before. If the passengers could only have felt assured that neither they nor their friends would ever fall from the top, it is probable that, beyond contributinto the funds for liniments and bandages, they would have troubled themselves extremely little about those who dragged the coach.",
