    "selftext": "Ideas about the American export of culture has been weighing heavily on my mind,. as well some other comrades I know. The \"Anglicization\" of the world, through the internet, and Media exposure,  threatens languages, and floods them with loan words. The vapid concept of the \"American Dream\" fills the head of many people from the Global South. I meet people from the Global South, Indians, North Africans, whatever, whom have a conception of America replicated into them through a petite bourgeois class consciousness . In fact, Petite Bourgeois conciseness is probably the number one leading cause of willing uptake of American cultural values and English.\n\nFurthermore, I do think this is something to be fought against. \n\nIs there any Marxists texts on this? I this something worth researching? The bourgeois identification of oneself through media, American cultural exports, and petite bourgeois consciousness is a material thing, I am certain of.",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's long, but it directly addresses what you're asking about in the context of a primary source. \n\n\"Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness no longer retain the semblance of independence; they have no history and no development; but men, developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with their real existence, their thinking and the products of their collective thinking.\"",

As well I think James Baldwins debate at Oxford touches upon themes of this.\nGalafani of the PFLP speaks about the influence of American imperialism in English interviews during the 1970s.\n\nRead Women, Race, Class by Angela Davis. \n\nbell hooks as well contributes to this discussion within intersectional theory (hooks was a Marxist) and focuses on it within Black culture in the US and abroad by interviewing celebrities and activists of the 90s in Outlaw Culture: Resisting Representations.\n\nHonestly, I hadn't thought of it before but your probably gonna get the best takes in my opinion from Black Marxists involved with or influenced by the Black Panthers or those usually summed up within than Pan-African and decolonial movements (as pointed out by others).\n\nFurthermore, the whole of the Frankfurt school focuses on how american culture is a fundamental part of its empire and how it develops and maintains its hegemony abroad. I believe its Habermas and Marcus  go into the most detail.",
