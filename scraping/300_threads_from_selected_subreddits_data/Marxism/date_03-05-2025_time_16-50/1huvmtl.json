If no one had critiqued me when I was a \"social democrat\", I would never have read socialist theory and now be a socialist.\n\nI understand the whole \"leftist infighting is bad\" thing but it is completely necessary in order to better define our rhetoric and future actions. Some unread leftist's ideas should not be given equal consideration when we are discussing ideas of the utmost importance. \n\nI must note that I haven't read anarchist or libertarian theory so it is possible I am missing something that everyone else isn't. However, I think Luxembourg and Lenin have seriously dismantled social democrats, anarchists, and other opportunist/revisionist ideologies. \n\nI do not say this to offend anybody, I say this because I want to bring about international socialist revolution and to improve the lives of all.\n\nDoes anyone agree or disagree that \"leftist infighting\" is extremely necessary?",

If your only knowledge of a subject is informed by people who are criticizing it (sometimes unfairly), then how do you expect to actually understand it if not on its own terms?\n\nDon\u2019t forget that Marxism is a scientific process, and as such, we must root our analysis *in science* and that includes criticism of past theorists who did not have as much of a body of scientific literature as we do to base their analysis in. We understand so, so much more about sociology, archaeology, anthropology, human evolution and migration, and other fields that you are doing yourself a disservice by *only* reading classical theorists - Marxist, anarchist, or otherwise.\n\nIs their work important for understanding the historical context of socialist and leftist development? Yes. Is their word gospel and must be upheld over all over theorists? No, that is a religious orthodoxy and incompatible with scientific methodology.",

There are later theorists who also bring forward new dialectical theories of material analysis which shed light on how the pitfalls of socialist projects and how to avoid them - of particular interest would be Murray Bookchin\u2019s dialectical naturalist theory, from which we understand the Social Ecological lens and prevent ecological catastrophe in the name of workers\u2019 power (like Lysenkoism or the Four Pests Campaign). \n\nI find my biggest departure with classical Marxist interpretation is over the State; I come to the conclusion by applying the methodology I\u2019ve learned from studying Marxism and applying it to the 21st century scientific body (rather than 19th century) of anthropology, sociology, anthropogeny, and the events of 20th century history. \n\nThe contemporary left is in DIRE NEED of learning HOW to think rather than WHAT to think when it comes to revolutionary change, lest we repeat the mistakes of the past (a tendency towards authoritarian rule and stagnation under the Leninist model; ineffective tactics and contrarian defiance by anarchists; and tribalist sectarianism across the board).",

I didn't take it too seriously, but wanted to give more substance to the discussion and expanded his take on the Portuguese Communist Party and my experiences growing up close to some of its members.\n\nAmongst several issues, from blind allegiance to Putin to upholding conservative values towards minorities to cater to old people, I shared the opinion that they lost themselves in dogma and blind fanaticism to classical Marxism-Leninism.\n\nThis and the resistance to involve younger people in places of leadership, stunted their growth and never allowed then party to evolved with the times and the ever evolving technology, culture and ultimately, the working class.\n\nThe fact that other parties on the left managed to somewhat to some of that - most, imo, moving their core themes and messaging away from the Marxist umbrella, which was also not a successful move electorally - co tributed for the ultimate downfall of a dying party and political movement in the country.\n\nSure enough, another portuguese Redditor and a communist militant pretty much accused me of treason to the cause and ***told me to quit political militancy***. Sheesh... I felt like he validated my point so blatantly I didn't even bother to answer anymore.\n\nDivision is precisely what the Bourgeoisie intends to fester amongst the Working Class - which was also a prediction developed from classical Marxism - and these blind followers won't even take the time to realize it.

People are afraid of communism, just the word itself is enough to scare them, so they don't think of it as an alternative. They don't want to do it and they don't like to be reminded that it is.\n\nThis is the same problem that activism faces. People hate vegans because they don't conform to the unethical status quo, so it makes non-vegans feel guilty, which is not pleasant. They hate environmental activists because it is much easier to continue to do what you are doing with a conscious paralyzed by the system. Likewise, they hate communists who critisize the social democrats, the status quo within the opposition. \n\nSocial democrats prey on the lack of class consciousness and they are very successful at presenting themselves as the solution. People, oppressed by the capitalists, put their hopes in the hands of other capitalists, blissfully ignoring that the system itself is the problem.\n\nAgainst the criticisms of \"dividing the opposition,\" communists should be stubborn and continue to expose the hypocrisy of the said opposition, and stress that they are not part of \"the left,\" they are by themselves a group.",

            "body": "Something that's often missing from these conversations is what a privilege it is to have the time/capacity/access/education etc to be able to fully engage with these texts in the first place. The vast majority of workers the world over will simply not have had those opportunities, and whilst criticism is an important part of improving understanding, raising class consciousness etc, the way it's done is crucially important. The second it starts shaming people for not being sufficiently well-read or dividing people whose end-goals are broadly aligned, it stops being a useful tool and starts becoming counterproductive. \n\nMy own experiences in activism and organising saw a HUGE amount of infighting which got in the way even when we were trying to achieve the same thing, and also put vast amounts of people off of becoming involved because they felt like they couldn't join a picket line unless they also agreed with every other ideological detail the organisers subscribed to, or couldn't have their say in organising an action because they weren't sufficiently academically well-versed to keep up with the discussions. We ended up losing out on solidarity and numbers from so many people who wanted the same things as us as a result.\n\nSo yes, criticism is useful when it's a tool for growth. But when it's im-right-you're-wrong, when it becomes divisive despite aligned goals, or when it places an expectation on the other participant for unreasonable or unattainable theoretical or academic knowledge/training it becomes extremely counterproductive. The right are so good at ignoring their minor differences and putting up a unified front that we're never going to overcome that without also making room for those we don't necessarily agree with on every little thing. By all means critique texts and theories. But when you're offering critique to an individual who just wants the best outcome and maybe hasn't had as much time to read about it or think about it as you, or maybe has but has reached slightly different conclusions, ask yourself whether it's actually going to achieve anything beyond pushing apart people who could otherwise be working towards a shared cause.",

You need activists primarily just to engage with workers in times where class struggle and train up party members. Workers don\u2019t just learn socialist theory without the intervention of the party. And the party itself cannot take advantage of opportunities without trained members who can handle things like repression, relating to workers in the factories, coordinate the party actions and bodies. To be able to give a speech, make an agitational pamphlet or social media post, to lead a march, to handle police repression. Those aren\u2019t things that the party learns without training and learning lessons from struggle. It would be pretty shit for the party itself to trail behind the workers because they\u2019re detached from the masses and too inexperienced to operate effectively - that was one of the major points of Lenin\u2019s what is to be done? To professionalise the party\u2019s cadres and party activities and cohere them around one organisation rather than a whole bunch of disparate ones. Activism (in the liberal or left comm sense) allows your party to train its people and contest liberal spaces in a way that recruits and champions socialist solutions to the ills of capitalism. Those ideas won\u2019t be taken up until class struggle is on the rise. But otherwise those spaces will be dominated by liberal forces. I think bordiga\u2019s party failed to actually take advantage of their revolutionary moment. Same with the German left communists. Partly that was due to the inexperience of the communist parties involved and overall small size. So during an upswing you have a whole bunch of new people who are learning lessons from the struggle the hard way. It does genuinely matter how many worker cadres you have during an upswing. Bordiga makes it seem like it doesn\u2019t because to paraphrase \u201cthe workers themselves will do it and that party activists should not impose themselves upon them as elitists.\u201d Which historically I think is not evident from these examples. There is a relationship between spontaneous class struggle, the spontaneous self organising of workers and the gruelling work by communist party activists in the stretches between, advocating for socialism and against the common sense ideas of capitalism. Bordiga\u2019s left communists also use it as an excuse for abstentionism or to remain a sect (entirely unintentionally mind).",

I find critiques of either ideology can be valid and are important. Marxism is a part of conflict theory which is a social science. It has been studied extensively. Anarchism, in my opinion is not any less valid as a \"science\" , I want to point out that empirical research was not a true standard until W. E.

The popular belief in inherent lawlessness infects socialist thought, along w the belief that anarchists cannot produce ways of showing how governance would work (it has been theorized over and over). I also find when I speak w/ Marxists or socialists that the lack of faith in humanity and their ability to work cooperatively without duress is disheartening. I am also indigenous and do not find that either ideology centralizes decolonization or sovereignty in a satisfactory way for me.\n\n\nI strongly encourage you to do your reading or maybe spend time around anarchists.

Anarchists and Marxists can have disagreements about theory and praxis, but work together to organize the working class. *That's* what's important.\n\nSecond, what unread leftists are you talking about? Teenagers who resent authority because they want to get stoned instead of going to school, or adults like me that had their lives upended by authoritarianism and Capital?\n\nThird, it's hypocritical for you to complain about unread anarchists, then admit that you haven't read anarchist theory. Anarchism isn't beyond critique, but if you want to engage in socialist discourse you need to listen to and consider the counter arguments.\n\n>Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Luxembourg all criticised... social democrats...\n\nSocial democracy is not a leftist ideology. SocDems are liberals. They're as left as you can be within liberalism, but they're liberals none-the-less. Implementing socialistic economics within a capitalist system doesn't change the fact that it's still capitalism. By \"Social Democrats\" I assume you mean \"democratic socialists.\" And yes, democratic socialism is problematic. They're as right as you can be in the socialist movement, but most socialists begin as DemSocs before being radicalized into a more truly socialist ideology. Excluding them hurts the worker's movement.\n\nIf you have problems with anarchism, then fine. But actually site Marx and Luxembourg and address anarchist counter arguments instead of saying \"These great thinkers had thoughts I agree with.\" That's just lazy rhetoric.",

Social democracy isn't so much one consistent, coherent ideology, as it is a political movement with shifting ideological foundations. The German social democrats were a party of revolutionary Marxists, until Bernstein's revisionism was adopted as the party line, which led to slow rejection of socialism wholesale and the promotion of Keynesianism, up to today's state, where they desperately (and disingenuously) seek to distance themselves from neoliberalism, which was fully embraced by Blair&Schr\u00f6der during the turn of the millennium.\n\nThis isn't just polemics but evident fact, the social democrat's unifying ideological paradigm is effectively the betrayal of the working class.",
