He has five years to make material improvements against a backdrop of increasing far right power.\n\nGalloway's Worker's Party is a collection of red/brown activists, tankies, and cranks. Fortunately Galloway was booted out, because he's a reactionary imperialist backing bigot.\n\nThe Gaza genocide is a divisivse issue: that is to say while it is a horrific crisis it is being used as a wdge issue by some while, domestically, the British working class have more immediate concerns. Eg, housing, healthcare, and cost of living. That is NOT to say socialists and marxists cannot have views on all things, particularly as internationalists, but to allow certain parties to play what could be potentially racially divisive politics, however well intended (or not, see Galloway), is a mistake. IMHO.\n\nThe far right are gaining popularity but the FPTP system ensures they have minimal parliamentary influence. Where they stood they fought ugly divisive campaigns, such as Farage's run in Clacton where the Labour candidate was subject to racism.\n\nThe Tories have been routed.\n\nVoter turnout was very low. Labours vote share didn't really increase past 2019. The greens did very well. While TUSC, a marxist electoral front, remains unpopular. This means there is no real avenue for an outright and explicitly marxist party, particularly of the vanguard persuasion. ",

I'm glad he won his seat again. \n\nHowever, as much as they've tried to purge the left, their policies still include building 1.5 million public homes, nationalising the railways, decarbonising the grid by 2030, legislating employee rights, establishing a publicly-owned energy firm... \n\nIf they achieve half of what they say they want to, it will vastly improve life for the working class in the UK.",
