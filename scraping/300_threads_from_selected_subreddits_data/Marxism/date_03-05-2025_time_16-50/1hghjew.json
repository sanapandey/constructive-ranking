    "selftext": "I always wondered why Marx classified doctors as performing unproductive labour. Now I know why. By productive, Marx means \"productive of surplus value.\"\n\nThis probably also applies to the concept of productivity. Productivity isn't necessary a sign of efficiency under capitalism if surplus value is not extracted.\n\nI wonder whether anyone else struggles with the productive vs unproductive labour concept. ",

            "body": "One might get confused because it seems like doctors patching up workers contributes to production.   \n\n\nUnder Marx's framework, a doctor\u2019s labor is classified as unproductive because it does not directly produce surplus value for a capitalist. However, doctors play a crucial role in the reproduction of labor power\u2014they restore workers\u2019 health, ensuring they remain fit to work and generate surplus value. This contribution is indirect: while essential to the functioning of capitalism, it does not immediately valorize capital.\n\nIf a doctor works in a state-funded hospital, their wages come from revenue (e.g., taxes) rather than surplus value. However, in a private, for-profit hospital, a doctor\u2019s labor becomes productive because it generates profit for the capitalist owner. Marx\u2019s distinction highlights how capitalism prioritizes labor that directly produces surplus value, even though reproductive labor, like healthcare, is vital for maintaining the workforce.",

Starting from how many jobs are actually useless, he goes on to say how the truly useful and meaningful productive jobs are often paid less.  It's a more light-hearted, humorous introduction to exploitation and the managerial class. Understanding why there are bullshit jobs is a great start of getting past the propaganda around capitalism.",

            "body": "I think it's an advantage if you can read Kapital in its original language. Marx uses the word \"Verwertung\" in one of his several explanatory scenarios, which according to my dictionary translates to, in an economical context, \"exploitation\". Exploitation however could also be translated to \"Ausbeutung\", which could be more understood as a moral judgement rather than a transactional process. Factually both are correct, but the intention of the message could be misunderstood as condemnation rather than a technical description of an economic transaction.\n\nMarx's definition of productive labor is that a capitalist \"verwertet\" your labor for profit, as opposed to you selling it directly to a consumer for your own sustenance. This process of \"Verwertung\" is at the root of the formation of capital accumulation, or, as you rightly recognized, the enabling of a capitalist to keep part of the profit as surplus. It says nothing about the usefulness of labor, it simply denotes the \"exploitative\" nature of the economic relation between worker and capitalist, as imposed by the mode of production.",
