The CPUSA is still active, but was once more active when they contested in elections more frequently. The CPUSA hasn't contested in a presidential election since 1984 and has not ever wona large enough amount of seats or votes to have any real impact. \n\nI am curious to know what Marxists think of the party today. Are they really communist and do Marxists endorse them? ",

Their politics are good they uphold the political tradition of Orthodox Leninism, have a line through Cannon and Trotsky, but they don't seem to be particularly caring in growing their movement and feel at this point more an academic institution than a proletarian one.\n\n\nEvery group has down sides some more severe than others. My advice is don't join a group and adopt it's politics, read, form an opinion debate and grow into a group based on that. Joining a group just to join a group is more likely to land you in a pseudo cultlet or an ineffective hype squad than it is to do anything productive.",

                            "body": "Here's my experience: DSA is robust and very active but has some structural problems that often make it kind of impotent and tends to skew white and affluent.  PSL is a lot smaller but more radical, decisive, and diverse but has a top down structure akin to old M-L parties that may or may not be your thing and can often devolve into a culty atmosphere.  They also primarily receive their funding from a left-wing billionaire named Neville Roy Singham, as opposed to the dues-based structure of DSA.  The culture varies GREATLY by chapter in both cases.  \n\nDSA tends to prioritize the \"D\" over the \"S\", which means they have to hold a membership vote on nearly every decision that the group makes.  This can be paralyzing in my opinion, and makes locals often reticent to participate in local coalition work with other groups because they cannot offer their members the same level of democratic control.  So DSA tends to do a lot of its \"own thing\", often reinventing the wheel and going down blind alleys.  They do a lot of excellent labor support work but in my opinion have struggled to find their footing on other issues.\n\nPSL practices Democratic Centralism, which means that the national org basically decides what the priority campaigns are, although local votes are still held on some decisions.  Sometimes this works really well, as PSL was given the order to throw everything into supporting Palestinians on October 8th, and it shows.  They've been a key part of that movement in most cities.  I've never been a member of PSL like I have with DSA but part of that is that they require a 9-month \"onboarding\" to make sure that you are ideologically aligned with the chapter.  PSL also runs its own candidates whereas DSA tends to run people as Democrats, although not always.\n\nSo there are meaningful structural and ideological differences between the two, even if they tend to work in concert.  If you want an org that prioritizes direct democratic decision making and working within the framework of American bourgeois democracy to achieve wins for the worker's movement, go with DSA.  If you want a more old-school Communist style org that explicitly aims to overthrow and supplant the state but has a more authoritarian approach to decision making that assumes you're on board with Marxism-Leninism as an ideology, go with PSL.  Both have strengths and drawbacks that are structural and not just about the kinds of personalities they attract.  \n\nMostly you'll be flyering and going to reading groups with either one though and occasionally you'll get involved in good fights when things align.  My experience has been that issue-focused organizations are a lot more effective than the ideological ones in the US and are often anti-capitalist too depending on the issue.  Your mileage may vary.",

They are self-defeating wastes of energy. By all means vote with your conscience as an individual, be involved in local politics if it seems right - but know that the systemic problems we face will *never* be on the ballot, because capitalist democracy will never permit fundamental threats to capital to be up to the popular vote in *any* capacity. If your goal is socialism, electoral orgs will never get us there.\n\n- Also give up notions of terrorism and \"propaganda of the deed,\" and individualistic anarchism that recognizes the problems we face yet retreats into isolation, paranoia, and desperate violence. Marxism isn't merely about blowing things up, it's about organizing and building the future with intention. [\"If we oppose terrorist acts, it is only because individual revenge does not satisfy us. The account we have to settle with the capitalist system is too great to be presented to some functionary called a minister.\" (or a CEO)](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1911/11/tia09.htm)\n\n- Instead, study Marx. Study his analysis of capitalism's strengths and weaknesses, how it built power historically and holds onto it now. Then study the men & women who took his teachings and applied it to the real world. See how only Marxist communists tend to actually complete their revolutionary program in *any* meaningful capacity (no, there has never been perfect revolution or communism immune from criticism; this entire project is hundreds of years in the making). See how the small number of non-Marxist popular socialist movements are uniformly crushed with police, military, money, and assassinations. See how mere violence in response does not create lasting victories or lasting power. Only Marxists tend to terrify capitalists, because Marxists can take the seat of power and *hold it*, using the forces of the entire working population, and intelligent, clear-eyed leadership.\n\n- Studying the history of 19th-20th c. revolutions, failed and successful, will clarify a few things for you. One of which is the *vital importance* of leftist infighting - or to put it another way, *the struggle for leadership*. We *need* to have a clarified program, strong mutual principles, an understanding of the strategies that will or won't work. The late 19th and early 20th centuries are absolutely littered with failed leftist movements, reversals and betrayals, but there is a reason Lenin is still so admirable all these years later. The key to Marxist revolution is creating class consciousness (we may never have been closer in the past 100 years of American history), organizing the newly awake & radicalized working classes under clear leadership, seizing control of the means of production across every industry (which in capitalist terms translates to \"grabbing the ruling class by the balls\"), and establishing new government. The decisions made along the way are not arrived at by emotion but careful logical reasoning and a firm understanding of how things stand. Sometimes it's the time for war, sometimes it's the time for peace, sometimes you regroup, sometimes you press ahead. We don't make these decisions blindly (if we can help it) but informed, with our eyes fixed on the goal.",

                            "body": "I\u2019d direct you to the CPUSA website and specifically this article: [Action steps to help build Resistance 2.0](https://cpusa.org/article/the-next-sixty-days-report-to-cpusa-national-board/). For one framing this movement as towards a revamp of the 2017 era Resistance is just asinine to me before we even get into the rest of the article. A Communist Party should be framing what is necessary as Revolution and building Revolution not Resistance. I\u2019m not saying that the CPUSA should be launching a revolution today, rather I am saying that should be how they frame their goal not as simply just \u201cResistance\u201d. \n\nNext, I turn towards this section which is so asinine it is unbelievable \u201cAppoint Judges\nTell the Senate: Do Whatever It Takes to confirm the 47 judicial appointments pending before Trump takes office. The courts are already stacked with Trump appointees from his first term. This effort is being led by all the organizations and labor that mobilized for the elections.\u201d Are you seriously telling me that a \u201cCommunist\u201d Party\u2019s second listed step in this all is that the Senate needs to confirm Democrat Judges? This comes in the list before taking Cuba off the state sponsor of terror list, or an arms embargo, or steps to oppose Trump\u2019s mass deportations. Is this really what is more important to CPUSA, it being higher on the list would certainly imply that.\n\nThat\u2019s just the beginning of it. As for your noting that they have fraternal links to orgs, ok? Like you list the CPC, which you know I personally think is funny to list as proof that the CPUSA is a Communist Party, but that\u2019s not the larger point. Let\u2019s look at who you didn\u2019t list. Looking at the International Meeting of Communist and Workers\u2019 Parties or the (IMCWP)\u2019s website which is a major point of international connection you can find [this list](http://www.solidnet.org/links/communist-and-workers-parties/) of parties they have relations with. A lot of these parties are quite asinine imo, but I\u2019ll list the ones which should be universally as reflecting revisionism and kinda tearing apart the idea they have bonafides on the international stage. One of the parties on the list is the Japanese (JCP) which is a flagrantly revisionist party which only cares about parliamentary participation. And I am pretty sure they openly abandoned Leninism like either at the time of the fall of the Soviet Union or right after. Another egregious example is the KPRF in Russia, which is flagrantly revisionist both in their participation in electoralism to the exception of everything else. But also in how they support the participation of the Russian government in the inter-imperialist conflict in Ukraine.\n\nI could go on and on about the flagrant revisionism of the CPUSA or its fraternal parties. But the point is clear, they are a joke who care more about basically the same things as the Democratic Party over what you would think would be more important such as support for Palestine or Cuba.",

A key and fatal flaw is their strategy of aligning themselves with the \"progressive wing of the bourgeoisie\"... like in 2016 they at least initially supported Clinton over Sanders. Say what you want about Sanders being a social democrat (which I consider damning praise in the context of US politics) but in practice their tactics sabotage working class militancy and independence.\n\nThis is all the more egregious in union activism. They famously supported the \"no strike pledge\" in WWII, which alienated the CPUSA trade union activists from other union militants. This allowed the right wing collusion between union bureaucrats and corporations and government that drove the CPUSA out of the organized working class during McCarthyism because the mass of the workers in most unions didn't see the point in defending them (aside from a few unions like the ILWU and the UE). This (and the terrible and ongoing legacy of racism) is a major reason for the isolation of the radical left from working class politics in the US; it's far worse than other capitalist countries where the left still plays some role in unions and the working class.\n\nOld line CPUSA activists (whether older cadre or those who follow them) still repeat these mistakes; supporting or taking appointed positions in unions instead of only elected positions, which leaves them vulnerable to being silenced or removed from taking on reactionary leadership. Their practice may lead them to be good unionists in some circumstances, but loyalty to leadership instead of the rank and file is a fatal flaw. I've seen this in practice over the years. Tho if I ever do happen to meet a worker in the CPUSA I do my best to see them as an individual until they parrot the party line.  \n\n\nThe CPUSA can always point to some principled activsim and militants.

DSA and PSL are the only really viable Marxist parties in the US at the moment and while they have their own issues, I definitely would not waste your time with CPUSA.",

            "body": "It is my opinion that while the CPUSA still has the potential to be a legitimate political force, it has stagnated into irrelevance at this time. The lack of true forward-thinking programs and policies, combined with essentially becoming water carriers for the Democratic Party, has wrecked its reputation and thus its ability to get anything substantial done for the people. \n\nWhat I think should be done is to remove the sitting CC and, for a period of time, manage the Party directly via the National Assembly. Revisit the Party Constitution and Program, and once those are approved implement them and enforce their rules and provisions consistently throughout the organization. Branches of the Party, from the local Club up to the National Assembly (and the forthcoming CC) must be completely on board; those individuals or Clubs that are not may be removed from the Party membership immediately. (TO BE CONTINUED)\n\nThe question is how to effect these changes? It is my thought that the Party needs new blood, new ideas, and a revitalized existing membership. It is through these that change may be brought about, not simply engaging in debate after debate with the entrenched current leadership nucleus. \n\nAll in all, I like the idea of an old-line Communist Party continuing the fight for the working class; I just don't think the current direction of the Party is helping to achieve that goal. The fight remains the same and to carry on that fight the Party needs to return to its roots. I don't say this from a reactionary perspective, only that of a member who sees the Party straying into Establishment roles and 'cancel' and 'woke' and and any other 'culture' that takes the focus off of it political and revolutionary purpose. \n\nWe can- and should- do better.",

Actual communist organizations focus on unionizing first, turning the means of production against their masters, and using that leverage across all industries for general strike and general revolt.\n\nA communist running for president is at best a publicity stunt.",
