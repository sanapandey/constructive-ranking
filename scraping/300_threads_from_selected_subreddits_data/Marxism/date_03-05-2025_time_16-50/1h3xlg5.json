    "selftext": "I am currently doing work that is important for preservation, however it\u2019s is me, and 4 old Vietnamese women making everything and the owners of the company drive fancy cars and joke to us about eating better food. I am angry. I make pennies on the dollar, and am the main person to produce metal tags for this company. How can I exert my importance as a laborer amongst people who tease me for my food resources? Can I change things? If not, how can I revolt? I want to be a manufacturer, especially in terms of making things for animal preservation, yet the exploitation for doing something so simple is awful. It is easy to make a lot of capital on the backs of myself and several immigrants. ",

We have exported the most exploitative labor so far from our daily lives.   At the same time, the immigrants that do come to the west are often so isolated from the rest of society, that their labor and suffering is invisible.   \nI don\u2019t even know where to start.    \n\nWhere do you live currently?",
