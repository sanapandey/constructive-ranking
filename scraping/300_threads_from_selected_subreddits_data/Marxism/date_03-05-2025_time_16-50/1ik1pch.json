    "selftext": "I am not a scholar and not someone who is well-read in Marxism, so this post is meant to both learn more but also to ask some questions.\n\nI would like to see a society where there is economic equality, where people receive money according to their genuine needs and not according to other factors like who they were born to, how much profit they can make for their employer, etc. In my own practice as a psychotherapist, I see people who approach me or others for therapy but are unable to pay the fee and one has to say no to them. This is painful. I have gone to a lot of length to accommodate people who are unable to pay.\n\nHowever, from what I have seen among the Marxists I've known, they find that violence is a justified means to the end of economic equality and basic economic rights being granted to all human beings.\n\nTo me this seems difficult to accept on two counts -\n\nTo kill another person is traumatic for the killer, because it exposes him to fear and rage in the interpersonal relationship between the killed and the killer. This fear and rage are then repressed, and are bound to keep haunting the killer, and he is likely to repeat the killings in the future unless he heals himself by integrating this trauma and releasing these painful emotions.\n\nSecond, if a person is successfully violent to another person and takes away his wealth and distributes it among the poor, the act of violence, killing, is validated in his mind, and it is not going to then confine itself to contexts where such acts are for the sake of the well-being of a larger number.\n\nFor both these reasons, I feel that social change that uses violence as its means is going to perpetuate violence. The victorious are then going to find new objects of violence in their colleagues or in anyone who doesn't agree with them.\n\nFrom the little I know of history, this has happened in the USSR and in China, both in their attitude to religion and in their attitude to countries initially outside their political control, for example Tibet in the case of China.\n\nI wonder what people here think about this?\n\nPS: I didn't intend this to be a \"let's debate violence versus non-violence post\". My bad, I should have been clearer. The more precise question is - \n\n\"The experience of violence brings up fear and rage in both the agent and subject of violence. Both people repress this experience. Like all repressed experiences, this is bound to come back. The subject may be dead, but the agent lives in fear and has impulses to express his rage on himself (drug abuse for example) or on others (violence). If violence is a central instrument in bringing about a just society, will this not be a problem? How can we avert it? If it will be a problem, do we take this into account when aligning ourselves with violence?\"\n\n",

People are already constantly faced with the violence levelled by the state and corporations against them including killing and torture, just take a look at the prison system, imperialism, and colonialism. People are already facing traumatic violence they are simply fighting back. Which usually ends up being my problem with non-violence preachers, they take the side of the oppressor and the status quo. They stifle liberation movements and denounce them as violent while offering no other alternative to liberation. If you want to look at psychoanalytical perspective on violence and colonialism you can checkout Franz Fanon. \n\n\nAlso I think your connection to prove your point is a very weak one. You\u2019re claiming that acting in violence once will lead to continual violence unless you address what you\u2019ve done in a professional setting. However, that is completely devoid of looking at individual circumstances and also doesn\u2019t seem to be true in general to me. Many people commit violence but not endlessly. We can think of self Defense as an example. Self Defense doesn\u2019t mean the perpetrator isn\u2019t traumatized, but the assertion that being traumatized through your own acts of violence will lead to a never ending cycle is short sighted at best.",

Every single one of them has perpetuated it either to others, or to themselves in acts of extreme self-hatred, including physically violent ones. I don't see how violence is not perpetuated. \n\nWhen I say violence, I mean even so-called small things like a parent screaming at a child. When I say it is perpetuated, I mean it is perpetuated not just in the form of that child growing up to become a serial killer, but by becoming a parent who traumatises his children by inducing fear, or by becoming a person who curses himself at every small failure and keeps his psyche in a perpetual state of fear. \n\nI completely agree that there is institutional violence that we don't notice. \n\nI am not preaching non-violence, I am simply noting a problem with violence, and that given the intimate work I do with violence day in and day out, I don't see how a violent struggle can actually lead to a peaceful society, psychologically speaking.",

Violence inbuilt in all structure of society.\n\nWhat are police, army, courts, private property - that are all tools of violence. Hungry want to eat? Food is taken form you by all this institutions. Want to have roof on your head? Again, same institution demand that you pay even if you can not. \n\nAll social programs that soften Capitalism are not inbuilt in system. They are external. That why they are always under attack and then come to be out of violence. All workers rights come from violence. Peaceful strikes? Did you ever study history? They are violently suppressed. Even resent railroad workers strike was suppressed by State, by Biden! They were stop by treat of violence by state, stop or you are criminal.\n\nAnd pickets used to stop Scabs by force. That is not an incident that Unions were often connected to mafia. They needed violence in order to enforce strikes.\n\nAnd victims of violence you try to help cope from Capitalism violence. Workers which have to power in workspace, do not have stability, have to follow orders take it out on families, propagate a cycle of violence.\n\nSo, we do need to build society NOT to build on base of violence, but in process violence is inevitable. Important for violence to have a purpose.\n\nFor example, Lenin denounce Anarchist violence, random killing of goverment officials or rich. That does not promote better society. But Lenin promote and supported revolutionary violence.",

On one hand the church was not just a religious organization but also very political, reactionary and represented the interests of the kulaks and petit-bourgeois, making it necessary to stop counter revolutionary movements within. But on the other hand there was certainly excesses and heavy handedness against religion. Marx mostly spoke of it as something that would disappear as the world became free of the exploitation and pain that caused many to flock towards religious belief, rather than be violently suppressed.",

In an ideal world we\u2019d require no violence at all.\n\nBut the logic of what you\u2019re saying is leading up to the fact we can never have a liberated society, because there is violence now, violence is perpetuated and will cause violence later. Yes you didn\u2019t say that non-violence is the answer but you are making the claim that with violence nothing can change we will be stuck in a cycle, I am simply pointing out we already are in a cycle of violence so whether or not we take part in violent revolutionary action or not we have already been exposed to violence in many ways and makes the question as a whole a moot point. However, as materialists we see that the material conditions are what direct superstructural changes. In this case, a system like capitalism which is upheld and based on the violent exploitation and oppression of proletarians and colonized will cause people will recreate violence to continue the system itself. However when material conditions change and we are building a system that removes those exploitative underpinnings found in the process of production that form our society we would see a reduction in violent perpetuation because it is no longer necessary as a tool of class oppression for the wants of the bourgeois. \n\nIt is simply an unfortunate fact that we have been left with no other choice. And I think part of this is why we must have a transitional period where the material circumstances are transformed before communism can come to be.",

You haven't really gone into any of your claims on the psychological aspects though, so I hope you can understand why you're getting these responses.",

                                    "body": "I can start with one example. There are two brothers, one 12, the other 7. They are both disturbed by the death of their mother recently. The older brother starts to beat the younger one, every day. He throws him to the floor, kicks him, punches him, humiliates him verbally and shouts sexual expletives at him which basically mean he is going to rape him - although he never does that.\n\nThe older brother is experiencing intense anxiety after the trauma of the mother's death. For reasons we don't know, he also has a lot of rage. He decides to act out this rage on the younger brother. The younger brother, already very anxious because of the mother's death, now experiences even more anxiety - to the degree of terror - and also experiences his own rage because he wants to hit back but never does for fear of being beaten even more.\n\nBoth boys are thus experiencing the emotions of anxiety and rage, and neither has the capacity to sit with it, to acknowledge this uncomfortable truth as part of one's consciousness, to allow it to be fully felt - in short, to *contain* and *integrate it*. The older one expels it out by acting, and the younger one represses it by dissociating and growing up to become highly mentally ill - having paranoid delusions, a tendency to burst into spurts of verbal and physical violence, having rape fantasies for colleagues, at times being suicidal, and so on.\n\nI have seen similar ways in which violence brings out both anxiety and rage in both the agent and the subject, in various constellations - mother-son, father-daughter, father-son, friends, partners, both adults and children.\n\nIn my practice have never seen an example of violence being conducted without anxiety and rage being present, and without these emotions then being split off - which means they will come back and be enacted again.\n\nHence, I say that the experience of violence is traumatic. That is, it brings forth such intense human emotions that for 99.9% of human beings alive it is not possible to not split them off. Any emotion that is split off is going to come back, and one will then have problems like wanting to hurt others or hurting oneself, verbally or physically.\n\nThis is what I do for a living - working through this in other's lives and helping them acknowledge their painful truth, to learn to be able to hold the emotion and not act it out or repress it, and seeing that the emotion, if held from a gentle, witnessing position for a prolonged period of time, dissipates. This is the only way to heal the trauma of violence, and it can happen both in and outside therapy.\n\nI don't have any books to refer you to, but I think the majority of practitioners of depth psychotherapy will agree with the above description.\n\nThus I don't see how the leader of a peasants' army can stab a landlord to death and not be traumatised, not traumatise the witnesses, and not lead to an inevitable cycle of anxiety and rage which will be played out in the numerous defence mechanisms human beings have to fight their painful reality.",

How widespread and severe those acts need be is speculation, but it will be necessary, because there will be no alternative.\n\nAlso, yes I believe that perpetrating those acts of violence will result in trauma that perpetuates itself and manifests in myriad ways. \n\nIt is simply something that society will have to grapple with when the primary source of violence is over with, and treated and healed, just as has always been the case throughout history. The light at the end of the tunnel in this situation however is that a post-capitalist society should be better equipped than ever to address the problems with which it will be faced. \n\nWas there any more to it you'd like to expand on or discuss further?",

You should also disentangle certain ideas you may be conflating.\n\nMarxists who defend violence believe that at a *social* level, violence is the best way to transform our current society into something better because those who currently run our society will not allow a peaceful transformation. Split this into the *transformation* *question*: should you transform one type of society into another, and the *violence* *question*: is violence justified in certain cases? The revolutionaries who formed the US. believed in the transformation to bourgeois democracy, and they felt England would not allow this transformation without violence. If you are sympathetic to the American Revolution, then you at least agree in principle with Marxists that transformation and violence can sometimes be necessary.\n\nOn a *personal* level, a Marxist can (and I think also should) believe that yes, committing acts of violence is probably very psychologically damaging, and yes, cultivating violent individuals might beget more violence. We\u2019ve seen lots of evidence that soldiers come back from war with psychological damage, and they harm others, themselves, etc. Wars are started for social reasons. They are never started with the main goal of doing personal psychological damage to their own population. So you can believe that the Allies\u2019 participation in World War II was justified socially even if you dislike that a consequence of it was more personal violence/trauma. You may know more about this topic than me, but my impression is that societies writ large, rather than individual soldiers, do not continue to see mass social violence after wars. (E.g., Germany cultivated murderous individuals and a broader culture of violence, but it became peaceful after WWII ended.)\n\nIf that all makes sense, then you should consider 1.) The *social critique* question, e.g., is our society flawed, and 2.) The *socialism* question, e.g., would socialism be better? Marxists believe society has flaws and socialism would be better. I\u2019d say learn more about those two arguments separate from your worries about violence.\n\nIn the end, many Marxists disagree with each other about the violence question, and many would not endorse what China has done in Tibet. However, all of them believe in the Marxist critique of society and that socialism would increase personal flourishing. They think this because it would make violence less common and things like psychotherapy would be more obtainable.",

So I only mean to disentangle concepts for ourselves so they can serve explanatory function. Again, Marxists aren't advocating for personal traumas, and using personal situations as an objection to social phenomena is missing a big part of the story.\n\nAs for the question of what happens to the violence: when the social need for violence is obsolete (e.g., fighting is done), violence becomes less necessary and fades. After World War II, German, American, and other soldiers stopped fighting, and civilians stopped hanging up banners. There was no need for those things. We can debate the nuances of how long things hang around in the ether, but kids in Germany or the US don't feel the personal violence of their great grandfathers in any meaningful way.\n\nIf you believe that what is happening right now in Tibet would happen in any socialist society, that's a critique of socialism, not the personal actions of people who fought a civil war in China in the 1930s.",

Everyone I know struggles with anxiety, sorrow, aggression in some permutation of these. People are unstable. Marriages are unhappy. Families are deeply flawed. Most people I work with have childhood trauma from their family. This is not normal, but it is normalised. Most people even today, and even more so in my culture in India, will not believe what I just said.\n\nThen some celebrity or some teenager hangs himself or goes on a shooting spree, and we identify that person as disturbed but we don't see that he is just like the rest of us, only more intensely so. It is one consciousness we are dealing with, and that human consciousness is deeply disturbed and traumatised.\n\nTo me this is as visible and as clear as coal is to someone who steps into a coal mine everyday and sees and smells it.\n\nNow is this totally unrelated to WW1 and 2 and to colonialism and partition in my country for example, to caste oppression, to the wars India and Pakistan and China have fought, to the way women have been dominated, raped, straitjacketed? I don't think so. Because the same perpetrators and victims have gone on to become fathers and mothers to children who have become fathers and mothers to people like us. We carry the anxiety and aggression in our consciousness and repeat it. It may not come out in public like somebody committing suicide but in small ways in which the mother is always anxious and neglects the emotional needs of the baby, in ways that the fear of the father makes a child study something he would otherwise not be interested in, in snappy comments, in parents shouting and sometimes hitting children, in violence between parents, there is trauma that is as old as human beings are.\n\nSo I do think that if there is a violent revolution that trauma is going to hang around in the air for many, many generations.

I think you are very sensitive to this fact because of your professional experience, which is noble and makes you seem like a good person. However, I don\u2019t think your experience supplies you with the evidence you seem to think it does.\n\nOne clarification: Marxists probably won\u2019t dispute the idea that people pass down shitty stuff to their kids, including psychical stuff. Certainly, if you says it\u2019s plausible that a patient was affected because their great grandfather was a traumatized WWII vet and beat their grandfather who beat their dad who beat them, I\u2019ll concede the point. Actually, Marxists probably have no reason to dispute many or most things psychology fields say, and I\u2019m happy to defer to you about how to diagnose, treat, etc patients.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t believe that society as a whole was impacted psychologically by World War II. America as a whole is a violent society because of World War II? And individuals are more directly impacted by their great grandparents than the actual environments they live in? No, and it seems absurd to say so unless you believe in some magical causal mechanism whereby individual experiences get passed onto to strangers. (I doubt it\u2019s very mainstream in your field to lay much or most of the blame on WWII, but correct me if I\u2019m wrong.) \n\nAgain, this is the personal/social distinction.\n\nMarxists would say is that the examples you give persist because of social structures, including institutions/dynamics of capitalism and the state. Simply put, our current society makes it hard to correct these issues you describe. The market/state doesn\u2019t allocate resources to them, and our political systems are not designed to help ordinary people.\n\nMarxists believe this isn\u2019t an accident; our society is set up to ignore things like helping families or treating mental health resources. I am a skeptic that socialism would magically fix our psychology, but Marxists generally believe socialism would mean real needs are prioritized over moneymaking. (E.g., let\u2019s figure out how to address cycles of abuse and then do it, not figure out how to make money off of mental health and hope a secondary effect is some people sometimes get better.)\n\nSo put your cards down:\n\n1. If you think our society is already set up to allow us to fix social psychology en masse, then that is your fundamental disagreement with Marxism. We don\u2019t need social transformation, just to wait or try harder to fix things. Say so.\n\n2. If you do think society is flawed but transformation can happen without violence, then I would invite you to explain how - I don\u2019t believe India or The US will simply let you walk up and take resources from the state or capitalists and just give them away to fix mental health.\n\n3. If you think that society is flawed and can only be changed through violence, BUT that violence will be so traumatic it cancels out all the gains of that transformation, say so.\n\nBut again, I just think you need to read some Marx or ask questions about the critique, alternative, etc. (Marx writes a lot about the social/personal distinction and why society is flawed; a ton of Marxists have written about what socialism might look like.)",

But there will be collapses in the psyche, community, religion, economy and elsewhere too. Class struggle is part of this larger picture. Neither the mental health pandemic nor class struggle are things I will pick out and highlight as *the* main problem with human civilisation. There's a holistic problem, and we are collapsing. I don't think there will be large scale revolution and where there is on a smaller scale it will be too traumatic for it to be clearly worth it - that's my very tentative feeling. \n\nRealistically, I only expect small oases of human connectedness that are able to transcend many of those dimensions of collapse - psychological, communal, economic, etc. - but only ephemerally and on very small scale. The rest of the 8 billion of us - I don't have much hope. \n\nI've tried reading Marx but I don't think I have the intellectual aptitude required to understand him and other Marxists.

He followed that up by writing a paper and then stating that his goal was to reestablish the USSR.  To me, IMHO, it's those three things that makes Russia inherently a Marxist country.  They have complete control of the country, but, yes, they still incorporate some capitalism (because they have to) and religion (to placate the masses)...to a certain degree (as long as it benefits the ruling party).  Much the same way that the U.S. isn't a capitalist country anymore.  \n\nSo, yeah, it's definitely debatable.  Lots of people would say Russia is fascistic and I would support that - but not for some of the same reasons other would.  (The same goes for CCP China.)  It's under that paradigm I assert Russia's invasion of Ukraine is it's Marxist imperialist phase (just like nearly a century ago).  I justify this more rigid stance because things are always evolving but I think anchoring to simple classifications keeps the general discussion on one path.

            "body": "Marxism doesn\u2019t promote violence as a first choice but recognizes it as an inevitable response to the systemic violence of capitalism. The ruling class doesn\u2019t peacefully give up power. History has shown this repeatedly. The police, military, and legal system exist to protect capitalist interests, not to ensure fairness. If the working class tries to peacefully transition to socialism, the bourgeoisie will use violence to stop it. Marxists argue that in such a situation, revolutionaries have no choice but to defend themselves. The violence of the oppressed in self-defense is not the same as the violence of the oppressor. \n\nWar and violence do leave psychological and physical scars, even on those who believe in their cause. But revolutionary violence isn\u2019t the same as senseless killing. In many cases, revolutionaries fight with a strong sense of justice, community, and necessity. This is different from individualistic, nihilistic violence. Moreover, organized revolutionary movements often emphasize discipline and political education to prevent unnecessary brutality.\n\nThe idea that \u201cviolence will keep escalating\u201d assumes that revolutions don\u2019t have a goal beyond destruction. But historical socialist movements attempted to build new societies, not just tear down the old ones. After revolutions, socialist states focused on reconstruction, economic development, and reducing the need for further violence. The USSR and China, despite their struggles, uplifted millions from poverty and built societies where workers had far more power than under capitalism.\n\nRegarding Tibet, the Western narrative often portrays China\u2019s actions as pure conquest, but the historical situation is more complex. Tibet was a feudal theocracy where the majority of people were serfs under brutal conditions. The CPC\u2019s intervention abolished slavery and serfdom, redistributed land, and brought infrastructure, education, and healthcare. While the process wasn\u2019t without coercion, it wasn\u2019t a simple case of imperialism either.\n\nIf you want a world where people aren\u2019t left behind due to economic inequality, you\u2019re already aligned with Marxist goals. The question isn\u2019t whether violence is good or bad in the abstract. It\u2019s whether oppressed people have a right to defend themselves against the violence of the system they live under. History suggests that peaceful change is only possible when the ruling class allows it, which so far has rarely been the case.\n\nI highly recommend reading the Wretched of the Earth by Frantz Fanon. VIolence is not just a tactical necessity but also a means of psychological liberation for the oppressed. Revolutionary struggle isn\u2019t just about seizing power. It\u2019s about reclaiming humanity. Years of dehumanization under capitalism and colonialism create deep psychological wounds. Through organized struggle, the oppressed overcome fear, build solidarity, and develop the confidence to shape their own future. This doesn\u2019t mean we romanticize violence, but we see it as a necessary stage in breaking imperialist domination.",

Individual terrorism being defined as small scale or locally scaled acts that are isolated in nature and are usually meant to send a message more than actually directly change political structures.  Such as for example, assassinations, industrial sabatage, random bombings, etc.  These do not encourage the working class to participate, do not actually threaten the ruling class's authority in any systemic way, and can backfire politically.\n\nIf there is going to be violence we would prefer it take the form of organized mass action by the working class, which can be sustained for a long time on a wide scale.  Such as for example a people's militia.\n\nThe other thing is that many of the most effective tactics marxists use are not violent.  General strikes can quickly bring the ruling class to its knees and can even overthrow governments.\n\nBut the main thing I want you to consider is how we define violence.  Because while many say they oppose political violence, they do not actually oppose it in practice.\n\nHave you ever told a soldier or police officer \"thank you for your service\"?  Do you think that it is ever acceptable to throw a person in prison if they commit a certain crime?  Do you think its ok for a government to have a police force or standing army even if those institutions are only used in certain circumstances?  Congratulations.  You support political violence.\n\nDo you think its okay for a country to take up arms to defend itself if another country invades it?  Do you think it was okay for the Americans to rebel against the British in 1776?  Do you think it was ok for the US, France, or the USSR to fight the nazis?  Do you think it was ok for the North to fight the South in the US civil war if the result was freeing the slaves?  Congratulations.  You support political violence.\n\nDo you support the existence of a state at all?  Do you think its ok for sovereign governments to even exist? Is it ok for governments to enforce laws or defend their territory?  Congratulations. You support political violence.\n\nAll political systems that have ever existed require violence to come into power, and all political systems require violence to stay in power.  Daily life under capitalism is extremely violent.  If I walk into a grocery store and take an apple without paying for it, the cops are called to threaten and arrest me.  That is violence in the name of private property rights and capitalism could not exist without that very violence taking place on a daily basis.\n\nNot to mention the daily indirect violence of poverty and marginalization.  Every homeless person who dies of exposure because he couldn't afford rent has died a violent death.  Every person who dies of diabetic shock because they couldn't afford insulin died a violent death.  Every child in a poor country who dies of drinking contaminated water has died a violent death.  There is such a thing as social murder.\n\nFor some reason, popular culture has an odd idea that it only counts as \"violence\" if it is people who are not in power taking up arms for their particular goals.  But when the state - especially states we support - take up arms to enforce laws or defend their own sovereignty, that magically does not count as violence.  Think about who may have benefited from such an idea?  Probably the wealthy ruling class who created the state and whom the state protects.\n\nIf we want to ever live in a world that is free from violence, we first have to eliminate the inequalities that make violence inevitable.  We have to get rid of class distinctions, and that can only be achieved through socialism which later transitions into communism.",

                            "body": "So what I am hearing from you is that you are concerned that revolution is a bad idea because it will require violence in order to impliment.  And that this will be extremely psychologically - and physically - damaging to every person who witnesses this violence, receives or impliments it.\n\nI 100 percent agree with you that violence is inherently harmful to all parties involved.  As you said, you have witnessed this personally through your role as a mental health professional.\n\nBut here is the problem.  We do not have any non violent options.  Whatever choice we make, whatever path we walk, we are going to have to deal with intense levels of violence with all the psychological harm that comes with it.\n\nIf we all abandon Marxism, abandon the concept of revolution, abandon any hope of anything other than mild and temporary reforms, then that isn't going to protect people from violence.  It will only allow the unspeakable violence of the status quo to go on and on forever.  If we chose not to fight back against this oppression, then we are complicit in this oppression and we become perpetrators of status quo violence.  Sure being complicit in the status quo isn't as personally psychologically damaging to YOU as it would be if you held the gun yourself, but SOMEONE SOMEWHERE is holding the gun, and someone somewhere is being shot, starved, disenfranchised, arrested, beaten, etc.\n\nIf we choose the revolution (which is not always violent, by the way) then we may have to deal with civil war or armed conflict, but that could potentially put an end to the violence all together because then we might be able to build a just world where everyone's needs are met.  It may even allow us to eliminate the original source of social violence all together, which are class divisions.\n\nIf you think of this as a trolly problem, and you have to pick the path which has less violence overall, the second path clearly is less violent.\n\nWe do not have a middle path.  We can't provide for everyone's basic needs without overthrowing capitalism because capitalism requires separating a large population of an exploited underclass in order to function.  Private property rights require violence to enforce.  Several socialists have tried to argue that there is a middle way, that we can reform our way to socialism through the existing power structures but that isn't an option in poor countries where any reform will immediately be met with obscene violence from the ruling class of rich countries, and in rich countries, reforms always eventually get pulled back as the ruling class retreats, regathers its strength and goes back on the offensive (Example, how Raegan, clinton, and now trump are peeling back all of the progress made by Roosevelt's new deal.)  We have to chose between revolutionary socialism or barbarism.",

Why does this man and his son want this kind of wedding? They are deeply traumatised, that's what I can say from my experience in my work. A sane, healed human being will not steal money from others and become vulgarly rich while there are people in poverty right around the corner. \n\nThis is where my experience doesn't echo with Marxist thinking. The source of injustice is not class division, class division is itself a symptom of emotional trauma and distorted perceptions of reality that come from it. You can end class division but the trauma will still play out its dramas in other ways. The people I see in my work who are either abused or abusers are well off mostly, that's why they can afford therapy, and many of them have had well off generations behind them. Yet they verbally abuse others, they harm themselves. They aren't victims of capitalism primarily, they are victims of traumatised psyches around them, particularly but not only in early life. \n\nSo I don't think anyone is going to change the whole 8 billion of us. But in small ways, among my friends and community, among people I know, among the animals and plants I engage with, if I am healed, I will not pass on trauma, and if I don't have the impulse to pass on trauma, I will not be greedy for buying a luxury car to show off or to divide people religiously and dominate them or to let animals go hungry. These divisions of power where the powerful exploit the powerless will not be perpetuated by me if I am healed. In this way I can light a small lamp in my little corner of this dark world. \n\nThe other approach - to change whole societies and countries with violent revolution (although you said it need not be violent) will only perpetuate violence, and I have described the mechanism of that as I understand it in the postscript to my original post. One also only needs to read biographies of Tibetan people to know what revolution has led to there. \n\nThere is a fundamental question - why should we not start with ourselves, and make a small change in the world, rather than formulate a mass change? There seems to be a fundamental belief among Marxists that personal healing and transformation is not a necessary precursor to social change, and can be left aside for larger changes that are external.",

Rajmohan Gandhi, one of his biographers, makes the point that armed revolt in the 1910s in India would have led to brutal repression and failure, similar to the 1857 revolt, and Gandhi's push towards non-violence was partly aimed at averting another such catastrophe for the Indians that would result in mass killings and worse economic exploitation.

            "body": "Is it always wrong to kill? Almost nobody would answer yes to that question. A moment's serious thought and you will be able to think of many examples in which the only moral course of action is to kill.\n\nThis then poses a wider question. What ethical framework does Marxism adopt? \n\nMarxism is not, as it is sometimes described by people commenting in this sub, merely an advanced method and system of analysis of history and geopolitical economics. It is a doctrine: an assembled body of the findings of that method applied with partisanship to the conflict between classes. It is, as Lenin put it, \"the doctrine of the class struggle of the proletariat\". \n\nAny Marxist ethical framework must therefore accord with the goals and desired outcomes of Marxism: which are the victory of the proletariat in the class struggle, the smashing of the bourgeois state, the establishment of a proletarian dictatorship (dictatorship over the bourgeoisie, which can be exercised through advanced forms of proletarian democracy, with a monopoly of force in the hands of the proletariat), the steady assumption of working class ownership and control over the key levers of production, and the progressive planned organisation and reduction of labour culminating in the dissolution of class division and the withering away of the proletarian state so that its forcible functions are no longer required, and its administrative functions are absorbed by society as a whole.\n\nThis goal, communism,  provides the only sustainable future for humanity and the only imaginable basis by which humanity can survive without being thrown back into far more barbaric forms of social organisation and existence, what is more taking place on a planet where deteriorating ecology is ever less able to sustain human life.\n\nTherefore, for the modern Marxist even more than for our antecedents prior to environmental catastrophe beckming imminent, moral questions are indistinguishable from questions concerning the advance or retreat of the working class in its struggle against capital. What advances the class struggle is good, what retards it or throws it backwards is bad.\n\nDoes this mean that the ends justify the means, in Machiavelli's infamous phrase? Yes and no. Yes in the sense that no method is automatically considered morally unacceptable if it can be shown that it advances the class struggle. No in the sense that a method which temporarily advances the class struggle but which fundamentally undermines it in other respects, which undermines the ultimate goal, cannot be said to be good.\n\nIn the days of the Bolsheviks, for example. assassination of an individual local Tsarist official or black hundred organiser could be fitted well within a wider policy of mobilising the Russian proletariat. A general strategy of assassinating officials, however, undermined that goal as it suggested that a terrorist saviour could deliver in place of the mass of the organised working class.\n\nAs the bourgeoisie is an enemy which unleashes the most unbridled violence without the slightest whim, and as it has proved itself so time again, and as it insists on maintaining a monopoly of force in its dealings with the working class, the obvious conclusion is that capitalism cannot be overthrown peacefully and that Marx was right to say that communists aim for the forcible overthrow of existing conditions. To rule out violence as a matter of some kind of general principle is an ipso facto breach of Marxist morality, and is in fact an immoral attempt to delegitimise the force that any slave must use to break their chains.",

            "body": "Violence is abundant in capitalism and undergirds the reproduction of capitalist society, but day to day this violence is usually of the speculative, potential kind.\n\nCapitalism is grounded in the struggle of two classes characterised by material conditions that are presumed to be fixed unto violent crisis. There's the proletariat, who must work for a wage so that they don't starve, and the bourgeoisie, who must profit so that they don't have to work for a wage.\n\nHow did the bourgeoisie start off the process that led it to own the means of production? Marx terms that origin point \"primitive accumulation\" and it is presumed to have been violent.\n\nHow does the bourgeoisie prevent the proletariat from seizing the means of production and all its other goods? By ensuring the state's monopoly on violence (discussed by the likes of Hobbes and Weber rather than Marx) is devoted to upholding the law, nine tenths of which aims to guarantee private property rights. \n\nA Marxist might further argue, as Adorno does, that violence inheres in socialisation during childhood development.\n\nUnder capitalism this violence is always already there. Marx's theory doesn't dwell on its necessity to political revolution. That word doesn't appear in CAPITAL, which is not a collection of moral arguments but a compelling critique of capitalist political economy.\n\nOne of the more renowned accounts of the necessity of political violence is Fanon's concerning decolonial violence at the start of THE WRETCHED OF THE EARTH, which I highly recommend. Fanon was also a mental health practitioner which might bring you closer to his standpoints.",

If you kill a person to redistribute his money to poor people the fear and rage of the moments of murder are going to haunt you, wreck your capacity to be calm and compassionate, and make you continue carrying out acts of aggression in some way or another, subtle or overt.\n\nAnd I am asking why communists don't see, for example, that to invade Tibet, to make hundreds of thousands of people flee, to become a threat to their leaders, to kill in mass, to drag monks and nuns out of monasteries and force them to have sex with each other - this can't be driven by compassion for the suffering of people, which I suppose is the original impulse behind Marxism. This can only be explained by something else, and perhaps partly by the fact that the path to power a Marxist takes can brutalise them.",
