Thinking back to people like Lysenko, how do errors like that get avoided and how would the modern scientific community change under a Marxist worldview? Obviously Darwinian speciation gave some merit to dialectics but I just wanted to know if anyone could shed more light on the topic. Thanks in advance",

The negation of \"being\" is \"not being\" (the dialectic arises realising that being only makes sense when related to the notion of \"not being\"). The negation of \"+\" would be \"not +\" which makes very little sense. That's exactly why Hegel was against using formal logic for metaphysics. \nMarx didn't like spending time on idealistic metaphysics (and just to be very clear, maths aren't material but ideal) , so he instead used similar logics on material social relations. With this in mind, that Lenin quote seems strange and kind of like a misunderstanding of the concepts of the dialectic.",

It's about the underlying material process which leads to the constant inception and death of concepts. \n\nIt doesn't matter what word you want to use: Negation, contradiction, refutation, overcoming, \"Aufhebung\", etc. Similarly, it's irrelevant which particular example from nature or science is used to *illustrate* the point that there is fundamentally no such thing as a non-contradictory phenomenon or idea.\n\nThese are all philosophical terms to very abstractly summarize something which is only found in concrete reality, and which is best described conceptually in the concrete language of science, in the actual description of the real laws of motion as precisely as the current state of the productive forces permit.\n\nIn this, Hegel was absolutely right that there is no \"abstract truth\", truth is always *concrete*.\n\nThere is no reality, therefore no rationality, to the \"concept\" of \"being\" as opposed to \"not being\". It is an abstract concept which serves as the starting point for an idealist and thereby inevitably mystical and metaphysical shadow of dialectics, as contained in Hegel's brilliant but largely abstract and \"conceptual\", i.e. idealist work.\n\nYou are trying to impose on Lenin the Hegelian (i.e. idealist) form of dialectics. As a student of Hegelian philosophy, you say it's \"strange\" that Lenin does not follow this form. You go so far as to imply Marx would somehow agree with your approach.\n\nBut here's what Marx himself had to say about this exact question:\n\n>My dialectic method is not only different from the Hegelian, but is its direct opposite. To Hegel, the life process of the human brain, i.e., the process of thinking, which, under the name of \u201cthe Idea,\u201d he even transforms into an independent subject, is the demiurgos of the real world, and the real world is only the external, phenomenal form of \u201cthe Idea.\u201d With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human mind, and translated into forms of thought.\n\nI recommend you read Engels who elaborates on this question, even though it is immediately clear you'll parrot the claims of bourgeois academia according to which Engels somehow deviated from Marx:\n\n>[..]in its Hegelian form, this method was unusable. According to Hegel, dialectics is the self-development of the concept. The absolute concept does not only exist \u2014 unknown where \u2014 from eternity, it is also the actual living soul of the whole existing world. It develops into itself through all the preliminary stages which are treated at length in the Logic and which are all included in it. Then it \u201calienates\u201d itself by changing into nature, where, unconscious of itself, disguised as a natural necessity, it goes through a new development and finally returns as man\u2019s consciousness of himself. This self-consciousness then elaborates itself again in history in the crude form until finally the absolute concept again comes to itself completely in the Hegelian philosophy. According to Hegel, therefore, the dialectical development apparent in nature and history \u2014 that is, the causal interconnection of the progressive movement from the lower to the higher, which asserts itself through all zigzag movements and temporary retrogression \u2014 is only a copy [Abklatsch] of the self-movement of the concept going on from eternity, no one knows where, but at all events independently of any thinking human brain. This ideological perversion had to be done away with. We again took a materialistic view of the thoughts in our heads, regarding them as images [Abbilder] of real things instead of regarding real things as images of this or that stage of the absolute concept. Thus dialectics reduced itself to the science of the general laws of motion, both of the external world and of human thought \u2014 two sets of laws which are identical in substance, but differ in their expression in so far as the human mind can apply them consciously, while in nature and also up to now for the most part in human history, these laws assert themselves unconsciously, in the form of external necessity, in the midst of an endless series of seeming accidents. Thereby the dialectic of concepts itself became merely the conscious reflex of the dialectical motion of the real world and thus the dialectic of Hegel was turned over; or rather, turned off its head, on which it was standing, and placed upon its feet.\n\nEngels too used the same \"strange\" examples from maths and science that Lenin used to illustrate the fact that everything is inherently contradictory and changing, and therefore can never be captured by one-sided \"concepts\", or any static concept for that matter: Be it \"being\", \"not being\", or anything else...",

Despite his dialectical method and at times brilliant intuition, his starting point was ideas, which inevitably leads to metaphysics and mysticism. His Criticism of mathematics was based on a very primitive understanding of mathematics. Frederick Engels was far ahead of Hegel in that regard, and even he was behind the developments in mathematics in his time. \n\nThe method matters but the concrete subject matter which is approached with that method also matters. Hegel's main subject matter was abstract philosophical ideas. A better and more concrete understanding of mathematics would have allowed Hegel to see in it the same dialectics he saw in the development of philosophy. His dictum that truth is always concrete prevailed once more.\n\nOf course, you can remain mired in idealist metaphysical anti scientific thinking of the 18th century carried over by Hegel in the early 19th century, and either claim that maths or dialectics are garbage, or you can approach the question historically, i.e. dialectically.",

I had a graph which illustrated this very well but can't find it right now - when a child learns language they will go through a period of accumulating words and phrases, then start to acquire plurals. As they increase the frequency and accuracy of plural use, the acquisition of new vocabulary drops towards almost zero, until they've completed the acquisition of plurals. At that point the acquisition of new vocabulary takes off again, only then at a higher level because the child integrates these with plural forms.\n\nSo the process of plural acquisition negates the vocab acquisition, which is in turn negated by new vocab + plurals acquisition - *aufhebung*. The negation of the negation, with the overcoming and preservation of the negated, now integrated into a higher form. Also quantitative accumulation of vocabulary leads to qualitative leap to development of plurals. Quantitative increase in use and accuracy leads to qualitative leap to accurate application of plurals across new vocabulary.",

Lenin we can forgive because most of his work on dialectics was in private notebooks where he was in the process of working things out.\n\nDialectical materialism doesn't really explain anything. It is a language of processes but you still need to understand the process to use the language correctly and say anything worth any meaning. The error of Lysenko and the Soviets of that era was expecting to apply ready-made conceptions and methods to a science. Marx actually critiques Ferdinand Lassale for trying to do this with economics:\n\n>\"He will dis\u00adcover to his cost that it is one thing for a critique to take a science to the point at which it admits of a dialectical presentation, and quite another to apply an abstract, ready-made system of logic to vague presentiments of just such a system\" (MECW, 40:261).\n\nDialectical materialism, then, can be understood as a shared language that can emerge within the sciences to describe complex processes. There are actually other attempts to create shared language in this respect. My favorite is Cybernetics and Systems Theory. IMO, in complex systems theory, you start to get a lot of things that mirror dialectics. \n\nAt best, though, this shared language would allow easier communication between the sciences on many topics but would not explain processes on its own. \n\nThe sciences cannot be fundamentally transformed by the ideas of the scientists alone. They have to be unchained from the profit motive and the need for funding. \n\nThe Marxist and engineer Amadeo Bordiga says:\n\n>\"Whether or not it be behind the capitalist as a person, industrial fixed capital, as opposed in its capitalist form to human labour, becomes the measure of the exchange value of products or commodities. This is the enemy Monster that hangs over the mass of producers, monopolising a product that concerns not only all present human beings but the entire course of the species down through the millennia. This product is the science and technology elaborated and deposited in the *social brain*. Today, with the degeneration of the capitalist form, this Monster is killing science itself, misgoverning it, criminally exploiting it fruits, squandering the heritage of future generations.\"\n\nIn other words, it is the economic and political whips and chains removed from science that will radically change it, allowing it to stretch freely with the needs of humanity.",
