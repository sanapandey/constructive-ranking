    "selftext": "From what I understand, and I acknowledge that I am not an expert on this topic, during the months preceding the Warsaw pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the general secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist party (KSC) Alexander Dubcek, introduced a series of socio-political and economic reforms than among other things, reduced censorship/governmental oversight of the media, made economic reforms with an emphasis on increased production of Consumer goods for the domestic Czech market and also decentralised political power in the country, including the federalisation of Czechoslovakia into two - Czech and Slovakian Socialist republics. These reforms collectively known as ''Socialism with a Human Face'' concerned Soviet Leadership who felt they risked giving fertile ground for western infiltration and the formation of a counter-revolutionary movement in Czechoslovakia, leading to a weakening of the Warsaw Pact (even more concerning seeing as Czechoslovakia was bordered by NATO in West Germany.) Despite initial talks where Dubcek repeatedly tried to reassure the Brezhnev and the other Warsaw leaders that there was no danger and that Czechoslovakia was and would remain loyal to Marxism-Leninism and the Soviet Union, these diplomatic talks failed, and the USSR decided to militarily occupy the nation to replace Dubcek and reverse his reforms in a period known as ''Normalisation''. The invasion was very controversial even at the time and led to splits in the international Socialist movement. Romania condemned the invasion as did Albania and China who called it an example of Soviet 'Social-Imperialism' \n\nSo with that in mind what is your opinion of Soviet actions regarding Czechoslovakia and Dubcek's reforms do you think Brezhnev acted correctly or should the invasion be called out and condemned as imperialistic?\n\nlastly if you have any recommended reading or sources to back up your statements/ opinions on this, I'd love to be able to read them to expand my knowledge on this topic and be more informed, so if you have any sources about this event please do share them.\n\n  \nTLDR -  Do you think the invasion was justified? if so then why? and what's your opinion of Dubcek and his reforms?",

Not only that, the normalization period that followed allowed for the entrenchment of the new collaborator elites, leaving us with a political tradition of blatant nepotism and kleptocracy that has lead directly to the rise of autocratic political opportunists such as Me\u010diar and Fico. The damage these people continue to do to society here is relevant to this day, and now more than ever since 1989.",

Sorry but EVERY SINGLE rapprochement with liberalism has led to the same end, sabotage of a socialist state and building of a capitalist shit hole. Including USSR itself.\n\nEvery single problem you have today I a consequence of going soft on \"reformists\". In the 80ies the same process repeated, only that this time there was nobody to clean up the liberal cancer. 3/4 good things in your country are a consequence of socialism.",

Majority of them will have a very negative opinion about the invasion. To my understanding, in the 60s there was a moderate optimism about Czechoslovakia building something that would be today called Nordic style socialism. After 68, nobody belied that anymore. It became just a police state.",

I hope this didn't sound too dismissive of first-hand accounts, that was not my intention, I was just trying to also state the importance of scholarly work too.",

I only made the comparison for the sake of illustrating the vibe that I believe was present in the 60s.\n\nI'm aware first-hand accounts might not provide the full picture. It's just that I met a few western or Chinese communists that tend to be dismissive of academic publications, mentioning western anti-communist bias. My usual reflex is therefore to suggest interviewing people who lived in the period.",

Obviously market reforms will undermine any implementation of Marxist theory, but specifically laws that should be objectively beneficial could not exist within the Soviet Union apparatus. This very much shows in their response- imperialist action in direct opposition to Marxist ideals. \nSo was Brezhnev right in that situation? I think that there was no good solution- that he was screwed from the start- but that the response only served to prove anti-authoritarian sentiment right and push them further from the Soviet bloc\n\nEdit: and from my time spent in the Czech Republic: despite the economic/social benefits they experience to this day as a result of their socialist history, there is great anti communist sentiment that this could not have helped",

Socialism in one country, bureaucratic terror against the state bureaucracy itself, purging of the old Bosheviks, purging of Trotsky, primitive accumulation of the peasantry and turn towards outright nationalism during the Nazi invasion... By the time of the Prague Spring the system was clearly tending towards crisis and so the soviet state responded as any bourgeois government would. Despite the working class seizing control over a significant portion of territory in 1917, there was never any question that a fully socialist revolution would be possible in the absence of a wider European revolution. Lenin understood that well, hence why the whole doctrine of socialism in one country was such an affront to his ideas and his legacy. To the extent there was a revolution in the economic base it was a bourgeois revolution, one where straight terror was used to rapidly transition to a fully capitalist society within a fraction of the several hundred years it had taken to achieve similar development in western Europe.\n\nIf it was a genuine proletarian state by 1968 then invading Cezchoslovakia under such conditions would've been a necessary evil. But it was not, so instead of spreading the revolution the government could only enforce the same old terroristic policy it'd wound up depending on in Russia itself to wage its class war against the peasantry and the working class.",

            "body": "There are two major themes here which bear being discussed.\n\nFirst) the USSR had several goals through the Warsaw Pact but one of them was the protection of the Socialist sphere of influence and power that was driving global socialist movements.\u00a0\n\nSecond) the goals of the Dubcek government that rankled the USSR in talks was the move toward political pluralism that would have weakened the position of the ML aligned party by allowing in the reformist intelligencia. This was the core of the occupations goals, the market reforms Dubcek wanted were already being implemented in other bloc countries throughout the 60s-80s without serious protest from Moscow.\u00a0\n\nTo the first point, the USSR was facing down heavy opposition from NATO during this time period and was involved in the proxy war in Vietnam as well as still healing wounds from the Cuban missile crisis. They HAD to show a strong front in the face of opposition. The alternative was allowing core socialist countries to drift outside their influence permanently. While Albania and Romania made a big show of leaving the pact the impact wasn\u2019t especially intense as the Balkan countries held a tight economic and political unity that allowed them to collectively weather the effects of being on the outside of the Russian socialist system.\u00a0\n\nI find China\u2019s criticism to be a little disingenuous in this regard considering their involvement in North Korea just a decade before and then their invasion of Vietnam which was to accomplish a near identical goal to the USSR in Europe with the caveat that attacking Vietnam was about pulling them out of Russias influence while also nominally asserting that the invasion was in response to Vietnam pulling their own Czech style invasion in Cambodia. The general feeling of the pact leaders was always that if left unchecked the west will coup a nation if left alone. Which, to be fair, is completely true.\u00a0\n\nTo the second point, Dubcek was being a little tongue in cheek in his negotiations with the USSR. He was right to seek the reforms that all other countries sought after but he was willing to hand the government over to people who were viewed as revisionists or liberals. Again, the outcry from other socialist countries is disingenuous because they would not have allowed political pluralism either and would have, often did, stop it with force.\u00a0\n\nThe story itself is talked about in the west as a major propaganda point which attempts to split marxists and revolutionaries by presenting the big bad USSR as the boogeyman and innocent Dupcek as a good leader who just wanted more televisions and freedom. That\u2019s a western myth literally built by the CIA.\u00a0\n\nThe real dialectic is geared around the impact of Russias way of handling the situation. I think if Dupcek wanted his reforms he should have made a compromise like all other bloc countries with the same reforms. His insistence on allowing non-party or new political entities into the government was what sealed the deal against him. You can\u2019t tell Moscow we are committed to ML and then allow the economy to be partially influenced by liberals. Especially in 1968.\u00a0",
