    "selftext": "Marx's analysis of money in *Capital* was developed during a period when the gold standard was in effect, making it straightforward to understand money as the general equivalent. However, it\u2019s more challenging to grasp this concept today, especially in an economy where monetary systems have evolved to function without a commodity backing money. What\u2019s your opinion on this? Could you recommend any texts on the topic",

            "body": "Marx anticipates fiat money in the first part (first three chapters) of _Capital_ volume one, though perhaps he would be surprised at the modern day results (the way Einstein\u2019s general relativity math predicted  black holes, but Einstein didn\u2019t at first think black holes would actually be found empirically). In chapter three, Marx discusses how an ordinary commodity\u2019s price can differ from its value\u2014so much so that a commodity can even have a price without any value magnitude at all. This also implies that the money commodity\u2019s exchange-value (the money commodity has no price) can differ from its value, so much so that fiat money bearing no value magnitude  whatsoever can nevertheless circulate ordinary commodities that do have value. \n\nMarx also anticipates fiat money in his discussion of the commerce (C\u2013M\u2013C\u2032) and capital (M\u2013C\u2013M\u2032) processes. Since the money commodity (M) is largely immortal, relative to mortal ordinary commodities (C), which generally are produced, circulate briefly, and then consumed. The money commodity can therefore circulate indefinitely. That is why gold\u2019s durability makes it so apt as a money commodity. This immortality of the money commodity combined with the commercial process, C\u2013M\u2013C\u2032, means that the money commodity need not itself bear value (bear congealed SNLT) to facilitate the circulation of genuine value bearing ordinary commodities. \n\nThe seller of a commodity takes a leap of faith\u2014C\u2013M, accepting valueless money\u2014because of the confidence that the money commodity is universally exchangeable with all ordinary commodities that do bear value: M\u2013C\u2032. \n\nIn addition, Marx also discusses how gold coins were often either inadvertently abraided or deliberately clipped to gather the precious metal for sale: such that the magnitude stamped on the face diverges from its actual magnitude (a \u00a3 is no longer a \u00a3). Already, through these processes, the value of the money commodity differed from its value. This clipping and abraiding leads bourgeois economists to assert \u201cbad money pushes out good money\u201d (the abraided coins circulate while the unabraided coins enter personal hoards or melted down for productive uses). However from a Marxian political economic perspective, the best money is money that is pure exchange value with neither value (no SNLT) and no use-value either, other than as pure exchange-value and universal exchangeability.  Therefore from the Marxian perspective, digital money\u2014devoid of any separate use-value and bearing no or negligible value\u2014is therefore the best money of all.\n\n\ud83d\udd25",

III, 3, b [English edition: Ch. III, 3, b. \u2014 Ed.]) how the function of money as a means of payment, and therewith a relation of creditor and debtor between the producer and trader of commodities, develop from the simple circulation of commodities. With the development of commerce and of the capitalist mode of production, which produces solely with an eye to circulation, this natural basis of the credit system is extended, generalised, and worked out. Money serves here, by and large, merely as a means of payment, i.e., commodities are not sold for money, but for a written promise to pay for them at a certain date. For brevity's sake, we may put all these promissory notes under the general head of bills of exchange. Such bills of exchange, in their turn, circulate as means of payment until the day on which they fall due; and they form the actual commercial money. Inasmuch as they ultimately neutralise one another through the balancing of claims and debts, they act absolutely as money, although there is no eventual transformation into actual money. Just as these mutual advances of producers and merchants make up the real foundation of credit, so does the instrument of their circulation, the bill of exchange, form the basis of credit-money proper, of bank-notes, etc. These do not rest upon the circulation of money, be it metallic or government-issued paper money, but rather upon the circulation of bills of exchange\"\n\nand he does talk more specifically about the idea of fiat currency in The Grundrisse:\n\n>\"Suppose that the Bank of France did not rest on a metallic base, and that other countries were willing to accept the French currency or its capital in any form, not only in the specific form of the precious metals. Would the bank not have been equally forced to raise the terms of its discounting precisely at the moment when its \"public\" clamoured most eagerly for its services? The notes with which it discounts the bills of exchange of this public are at present nothing more than drafts on gold and silver. In our hypothetical case, they would be drafts on the nation's stock of products and on its directly employable labour force: the former is limited, the latter can be increased only within very positive limits, and in certain amounts of time. The printing press, on the other hand, is inexhaustible and works like a stroke of magic.\"",

Like Richard Wolff, he emphasizes the importance of Kapital vols 2 and 3 - most people stop at 1. Michael Hudson was at the top level of balance of trade decisions in the 70s, partly because Chase Manhattan tacitly understood that only economists with a background in Marxist thought had an accurate grasp of the issues and could make realistic predictions.\n\nGenerally the topic you're most likely interested in is Modern Monetary Theory.

Money is printed from signatures. Created all the time. I\u2019ve been looking into studying the codes of how this money is created. Apparently according to U CC banks don\u2019t loan money! Once the loan is created, the fed makes the money! Also remember fractional reserve banking.\u00a0\n\nWe are at a very dangerous place where our lives and economies can be changed and wielded pretty instantaneously, I don\u2019t know if I can compare this to other times in history of which is worse",
