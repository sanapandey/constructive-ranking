But it has to be a use value in order to be exchanged, and under the division of labor the use value of commodities to the producer is their exchange value. These antagonisms and contradictions manifest themselves if, for example, a commodity fails to find its buyer and its value therefore cannot be realized because it fails to be a use value to its potential buyers. Or when use values are thrown out because reducing supply is profitable, even when people need those use values (as another commenter pointed out).",

The use value is only the means to gain exchange value.",

It doesn't matter that the oranges could feed you, that the clothes could keep you covered and warm, that the cars could be used for transportation-- if some one lacks money, then they are excluded from the useful wealth that exists in abundance. Already, even at this most basic level of the commodity, capitalism is already irrational: it appears as an immense accumulation of commodities, piles of wealth and stuff-- but it's not there to be used, it's not available for consumption, but there to be exchanged to make profit, to make money.\n\nThis is something many don't seem to grasp when reading capital-- that even in chapter 1, there's already criticism going on.",

            "body": "Any product of human labour only becomes a *commodity* when it is produced for exchange on the market as a use value. A use value does not refer to the specific instance of a product, but as an abstracted quantity of the product which can be used for any number of purposes. \n\nFor example, a use value such as 1 ton of iron does not necessarily refer to iron produced by X factory in say, Shenzhen on the 15th of May, 2023. It refers to any instances of iron bought and sold on the market which has the specific chemical properties necessary to be useful to the buyer. \n\nExchange value is similar. When expressed as hours or other units of time, it does not refer to the specific labor of this or that factory worker, but to the *average labor required by the average worker* *under average conditions*\n\nFor a commodity to acquire exchange value, it also has to have a use value. This is what many people who make naive criticisms of Marxism don't seem to understand. That's why they make arguments about how say, a mud pie has no value no matter how much labor you put in, or that the value of a 5 minute painting by a famous artist can be worth 1000s of dollars.\n\nWhat both examples show is only that commodities with no definable use value also have no definable exchange value. You can only make averages of a plural of commensurate of items. That's why you can't average the labor time taken to produce paintings between a famous artist and a newbie to find some common exchange value for paintings in general. Abstraction and standardization are necessary for commodity production.",

The contradiction between exchange value and use value comes into being only with the real universalization of the former. This is the dialectical character of the contradiction.\n\n\nWhen exchange value successfully mediates the whole of human activity and society's production is characterized as production for exchange, that marks the first time where history can be employed in the interest of the present.\n\n\nHowever, the alienated character of exchange value takes up that history in an unconscious and therefore unfree manner. If the relation between people is appears as the relation between things, the enormous productive capacities which crystalizes the new social principle of abstract labor time come to reproduce abstract labor time as such. Rather than immense productivity rendering work unnecessary due to the enormous use values offered by the utilization of history, history ossified and reproduces (rather than transforms) itself.\n\n\nLabor, the abstract substance underlying the equality necessary for exchange, is reconstituted rather than overcome, but the possibilities latent in the enormous capacities of capital (the 'use value' of industrial production) points to the possibility of a different social existence.",

For example, capitalism creates more food than any other system beforehand. And yet, because those things must be sold for a profit, they cannot be used to solve the world's problems to their full potential. There have always been starving people but now there are starving people while having more food than ever and more ability to transport that food to them than ever before.",
