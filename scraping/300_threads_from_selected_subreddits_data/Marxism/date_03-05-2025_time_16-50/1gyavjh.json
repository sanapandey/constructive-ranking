The consciousness of mankind is shifting, and I think the value of the 40 hour work week pretty much sums it up: most people find that their work week only affords them what is needed to get by. This is really the hurdle we have to overcome, is people accepting that their output produces only what they need. However, I don't see cash going away completely just yet, too much relies on it. There will be a slow transition, but our policy needs to begin moving in that direction. Are there political activist groups or communities that are trying to affect policy?",

I\u2019m not a member and haven\u2019t committed but I think at the core there is a base of knowledge and experience that is useful. There\u2019s already a lot of this existing in our parties and other organizations so we don\u2019t have to start from scratch.\n\nGiven that there\u2019s a lot of knowledge and unrecognized work already being done out there, what\u2019s needed is a sense of unity and cohesion. I\u2019d love it if the Trots, MLs, anarchists, and other assorted leftists could squash these decades-old beefs and get their priorities straight. That has to be settled after the revolution, and hopefully our experience will make those feuds irrelevant, allowing us to get things done and not more ourselves in factionalism while our enemies regroup.\n\nSorry if it\u2019s too simplistic and idealistic but that\u2019s my take.",

To do that, like you said, we need to let go of preconceived notions of what is right and wrong, and just make it work. I see Marxism as not just an economic policy, but a state of mind people have to embody. What is this revolution you speak of? I think the best way is to set an example of a small society or community that does this effectively, and let more people join in. Ultimately we have to transcend the greed that propagates capitalism now.",

People set on success don't give up. After three of Elon's rockets failed, he pushed through to the fourth. MLK and people who fought racism didn't give up even though their efforts failed multiple times. The trait you are missing is called perseverance. You're also thinking in exclusive terms. This community can coexist with capitalism, but whether you want it or not, humankind is ready for this kind of system, capitalist owners just profit from keeping society stupid and in the status quo. Things only work if the people attempting them persevere. The problem is it cannot be forced, like capitalism currently is. Capitalism and free trade can be forced on people because it's literally a competition. You can guarantee your success in spite of others efforts, leaving the less fortunate to fight for jobs that owners and entrepreneurs hand out. In what I'm describing, people will work with people for the common welfare of people. I think the concept you are also missing is coexistence. Just because one thing exists, doesn't mean it has to fight another.",

A society where necessary labor time is looked to be minimized for the free development of each individual to be maximized, and each member gets back approximately what they put in.\n\nPoint is, Marxism is absolutely compatible with (and I would go as far as to say prioritizes) individualism. Rather than expecting modern humans birthed into a world of unbridled competition to suddenly switch gears into an altruistic worldview, working people need to learn that a vast portion of their time spent at work is in the service of somebody else's (likely a group of fully unproductive shareholders in today's capitalism) wealth.",

You do you. You are focused on words, I'm focused on implementation, that's the difference between me and you. I wasn't trying to be unique, that's not my goal? My goal is to change stuff.

The system you are imagining relies on the entirety of the population to reach consensus regarding a system to administer  a country. That will simply never happen. So even if Marxists are the majority, what happens to those who are not Marxists? Do the Marxists continue to allow them to degrade the system, and Marxists principles? Or will they be imprisoned or worse? The soviet union did create an economy that kept free trade and allowed people to have all those guarantees you mentioned. It collapsed in 70 years, taking the lives of millions with it. Marxism is a political ideology that favors the urban elite and punishes the rural population and arguably has distain for the rural populations. It's not hard to see why it is that was as Marx and Engles lived off of the money provided by factories owned by Engles' family.",

Urban elite like Elon Musk whose entire fortunate comes from the free market? What? Like you expected me to glance over that? Haha. Marx and Engels can participate in negative behavior but still acknowledge the truth. That's how society advances. We're doing bad things, but need to change our behavior. Initially we do things to survive, those actions become habits, and take over our lives. \n\nHow does any interest group, club, or society start? Do you join a chess club if you hate chess? That question seems to answer itself. Marxist policy will start on maybe an island, or a space free of capitalist influence. We aren't trying to hurt people, bad people regardless of Marxist influence do that. Just set an example of what is possible. Those who learned capitalism will die, and those born into a Marxist society will give birth to more people who either have the choice of being in said society or going off to a free market economy. Ultimately, this is about choice. But I want these two systems to coexist. Not be mutually exclusive. Humans want choice, and only the individual can decide how they want to live. Right now, the only choice is fight for your life in a free market society. Let's give people a different choice.",

My problem is that a communist system gives bad people a very sure way to power an influence, and that is joining a dominant Marxist movement. There  was a saying in the Soviet Union paraphrased was \" Every communist joins the Communist Party, but not everyone in the Communist party is a communist.\"  The major flaws in Marxism is the power wielded by a few. I can't think of a single communist movement that didn't repress its citizens and create a party elite. Now I admit not every communits is like that. Guevara despised the decadence of the Soviet Union and believed that China had the purer communist system. But look at China now it defame decadent in roughly the same amount of time it took the Soviet Union. Without fail, every Marxist system has turned violent and repressive. It is a flawed system that allows the worst to gain power with few mechanisms to stop them. Capitalist democracy is flawed as well, but at least murder of political dissedents is considered wrong and is illegal. Whether that has played out historicaly is debatable.",
