    "selftext": "I am currently a white high schooler living in the US. I consider myself a marxist, and I want to become a history teacher. I also plan on learning Spanish through college so I can communicate with more people in life, but also as many students as I can.\n\nI recently discovered TEFL, and find it a very interesting idea to do for a year or two before college, in regards to learning Spanish, learning about history outside the world hegemon, and gaining teaching experience. As for the actual work despite all of the benefits it might give me I am afraid that teaching english abroad will just promote imperialism/neocolonialism. I am aware that learning English can provide upwards movement for some children, but that very well could be a small percentage, and this is the reason I am still considering this as an option.\n\nLove and solidarity",

Marxists were the original internationalists: workers of the world UNITE. Certainly in order to unite we must converse with each other.\n\nWhile there is little to no uncompromised activity in the context of capitalism, I would not worry that teaching English would be spreading imperialism or neocolonialism. Especially because you wish to be learning Spanish while you are teaching English, you have the chance to subvert the relationship of dominant first world teacher over lower third world student.",

It\u2019s not anti imperialist to gatekeep people on the grounds that the spread of English as an international language was and is a product of imperialist domination. In some ways actually it\u2019s good for the socialist movement because it allows lefties across the world to communicate more easily. Back in marx\u2019 day everyone learned English, French, German and Russian to be able to communicate across borders with their international comrades. \n\nBeing a moralist about these things is futile and distracts from class politics. Workers don\u2019t have any meaningful contribution to global imperialism or any choice in the matter. Everything we own is built on misery and exploitation. Just living itself is.",

Basically, while education can be colonial in nature, as a teacher, you can choose to interrupt that relationship but also to understand that the people seeking knowledge from you are also acting politically in their own interest, and so you need to come from a place of collaboration with them as equals instead of a paternalistic mindset that sees them as oppressed and unable to exert political will.",

I am aware that learning English can provide upwards movement for some children, but that very well could be a small percentage, and this is the reason I am still considering this as an option.\n\nNotice that you recognize learning English can be advantageous to children, so you're worried that the number you could teach would be small.\n\nBut to be clear, you aren't concern that *teaching* English abroad will just promote imperialism/neocolonialism, you are concerned that people abroad *learning* English would be promoting imperialism - I'm guessing because they're learning a hegemonic language instead of having the same economic advantage being restricted to using their mother tongue. The point about teaching is that - if this learning of a hegemonic language is them becoming colonized, you don't want to contribute or benefit from that.\n\nWell, I'm guessing the only reason you would be able to teach English is because there is enough of a demand to hire native English speakers to teach, and this demand is likely because their economy is already under the sway of globalization, and English is the lingua franca at the moment. So that sounds like they didn't need to speak English to have their economy captured by foreign capital, so them learning English isn't subjugating a free people, it's giving workers tools they need to thrive in the environment already saturated with English, does this make sense? \n\nYou are a worker who needs money to live. \n\nThey are workers who stand to benefit from you teaching your language.\n\nYou are teaching those who self-selected to learn from you tools they can benefit from.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd while it isn't the lingua franca, Spanish is still an imperial language, too.",
