    "selftext": "Hi\n\nI realized one day that my understanding of how division in labor results in classes and antagonism is somewhat superficial. Marx presents this view in German Idiology, but doesn't really elaborate it much. My understanding is that Marx does not think that division of labor in all senses of the word would disappear under communism (this would be an utterly meaningless thought), just that we would be free to engage with any work we want to. This raises the question, *in what sense* *of 'division of labor'* *does classes, and as a consequence antagonisms rise, and why?*\n\nIt seems that the unfreedom is rather a symptom and a prerequisite of the class antagonisms. In other words, class antagonisms would dissolve if people were free to engage in what ever work they wanted to. But it doesn't describe why a division of labor would create a division of interests.",

It's true that class antagonisms are a fact, but it also seems that Marx is not content with simply stating facts, but wants to understand their dialectical origin. In this sense, stating the fact simply begs the question. He says in German Ideology that already in the family there is a division of labor, which then turns into a patriarchy.",

                            "body": "In the early days of capitalism, capitalists would invest their capital in building a new factory or building a new mine. For these factories and mines to be worked they needed to find people to employ to work them and pay them a wage.\n\nThey were never going to just invest in building a factory (and by the way, someone, i.e., yet more workers, of course had to build the factory in the first place) and then go \"Okay, good, now I have a factory I'm going to let the people who work here own it and share the profits amongst themselves.\"\n\nI mean, *some* exceptional, good-natured people who had lots of wealth to dispose of might have thought that, but most didn't. Division of labour was built into the logic of the fact that the means of production got built by capitalists investing in their construction, not workers pooling together and saying \"hey, let's all build a factory!\"\n\nEdit: Not to mention as well that the very concept of \"free labourers\", i.e., people selling their labour for a wage, pre-dates capitalism. Wage labour existed in the towns during the middle ages and in some cases earlier, so when capitalists did build factories during the industrial revolution, the default way to get the factory producing was to just employ people, because the idea of employing people was already there from a pre-existing social system (albeit on a much smaller scale than in capitalism). So it would have rarely entered anyone's heads to say \"Why do I need to employ anyone to work this factory at all? Why can't people own it in common and work it and share the wealth?\" And of course the people who *did* think that were not capitalists, but socialists.",

There seems to be an assumption that people are inherently greedy/selfish/self-absorbed or something akin to that. Say, if man goes to hunt, wife tends to kids, then \\*boom\\*, they have separate interests, and a patriarchal society has been born. \n\nAlso, he seems to imply that technology can overcome this problem, because all natural and unnatural divisions of labor can be overcome when anybody can do anything.",

In fact humanity lived for the vast majority of its existence like this without classes. Class society arises when the means of production cause there to be a surplus instead of living every day hand to mouth. As soon as there's a surplus of food, you need means to store it, means to distribute it, and means to guard it. Such a situation requires by necessity some people to look after the surplus and some people to create the surplus. From this arises the phenomenon of social classes, i.e., groups of people who have a distinct social relationship to the means of production and therefore distinct roles within society. From class society arises the state.\n\nI recommend actually reading Engels instead of Marx if you're interested in the origins of class society. *The Origin of Family, Private Property, and the State* goes into exactly these discussions.\n\nA brilliant and highly recommended text which complements that book well is also by Engels: an unfinished essay titled *The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man*. It takes a historical materialist approach to human evolution itself and how human beings evolved the means to work, think and eventually develop class society to begin with.\n\nWritten a century and a half ago, there were many things in it which were later vindicated by science.\n\nFor example, in Engels' day, scientists believed humans evolved big brains first, and everything flowed from that. Engels, without any fossil evidence, just by the power of dialectical reasoning argued that the human hand and walking upright must have evolved first, and the hand's ability to make tools caused us to evolve higher intelligence and therefore bigger brains.\n\nSuch a view is now established scientific fact. The fossil record shows there were ancient hominin species which were bipedal (they walked on two legs) with well developed hands suitable for tool-making, but with small brains.",

The ruling class owns the means of production and the working class sells their labor time to the ruling class to make production happen. You can have a division of labor while eliminating this class distinction. Namely, by having the means of production be collectively owned by the whole society.",

            "body": "Part of the answer is in Capital Vol 1, where he makes an important distinction between the division of labour in society and the division of labour in a factory (or within any specific workplace). Another key has do with how divided work is organized \u2014 the ownership of relations of production by capitalists and the workeds\u2019 lack of any means to do anything but sell their labour power. So in this particular division of labour, all the qualitatively different forms of work are subsumed under the quantitative measure of labour power (as labour time and wages). All economies have some kind of social division of labour, but capitalism as a specific way of dividing labour that is based on the production of surplus value for capitalists.",

At the same time, care should be taken to ensure that 'classes' don't arise within the labor force; for example, one wouldn't want the Auto Finishers to get any idea that they're better than the Brake Rotor Polishers just because the Finishers work with a more complete automobile. We don't want Managers thinking they're 'better' than the Assembly Line workers just by virtue of their position. The Managers may hold a position of responsibility and authority, but all Comrades- regardless of their position or employment- deserve the same respect.",
