    "selftext": "according to marx: \n\n\"Accordingly, the individual producer gets back from society after the deductions exactly what he has given it. What he has given it is his individual quantum of labour. For instance, the social working day con- sists of the sum of the individual hours of work. The individual labour time of the individual producer thus constitutes his contribution to the social working day, his share of it. Society gives him a certificate stating that he has done such and such an amount of work (after the labour done for the communal fund has been deducted), and with this certificate he can withdraw from the social supply of means of consumption as much as costs an equivalent amount of labour. The same amount of labour he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another.\"\n\nIn other words, each person receives back from society exactly what it gave them (in hours of work). However, there are jobs that are more exhausting than others, for example, jobs such as bricklaying, street sweeping and septic tank cleaning, garbage collectors, a miner, all of which are jobs necessary for a society to function and are much more exhausting than, for example, someone who works in an office, a cashier, or a doorman. If everyone received their work cards equivalent to the amount of time worked, then almost no one or no one would want to do jobs that caused extreme physical exhaustion. How do you think this could be solved in the best possible way? ",

I had even thought about a system in which each person would have to do a certain amount of \"Unpleasant Work\" per month or per week, so that even a person who works in an office would have to take time out of their week to, for example, sweep the street. But the problem with this arises in professions like bricklaying, which in addition to having physical work is something that not everyone knows how to do, so if you put the person in the office in this profession, they wouldn't know how to do anything. Anyway, your answer was also good.",

What someone gives is their time certainly. But they also give their effort. Socially necessary labor-time (SNLT) includes duration, exertion intensity, skill, and so forth. Marx acknowledges that everything that produces use value is productive in some sense (even if capitalists treat it as unproductive because the contribution is h productive of value and surplus value). Even arbitrage can be considered a contribution to society. \n\nWhat is not a contribution is exploitation: exploiting the labor and other contributions of others and making their contributions your property. Pilfering the common treasury of natural resources and natural resource rents is not contributing. It is anti-social. Yet in capitalism these anti-social activities receive the greatest rewards.\n\nIn the _Manifesto of the Communist Party_, Marx and Engels list \u201cequal obligation to work\u201d as one of the planks. Each would have an equal obligation to the exhausting and odious work as with the equal obligation to other work. This does not mean everyone does exhausting work.  But it would mean that such a contribution to society as exhausting or odious work might be counts as a contribution alongside time, or exertion, or acquired skill. \n\nWith equal obligation to work the exhausting and odious work would be the first to be automated out of existence. With capitalism, we see the capitalists seek to automate the creative and most fulfilling work and leave the most exhausting, odious, and rote work to human beings.",

I had thought of a system in which everyone would have to do \"bad jobs\" every month or week for social contributions, so an office worker would have to dedicate a few hours a week to sweeping the streets. The problem with this arises when, for example, we go into an exhausting profession that also requires some intellectual work, such as bricklaying, for example. An office worker probably wouldn't know how to build a wall. Anyway, now I understand better. Thanks for the reply!!",

            "body": "Currently, exhausting and physically demanding (and often dangerous) jobs are amongst the lowest paid jobs, so the same argument would apply to our current situation: nobody would willingly do those jobs if they had a choice. People are socially (which in our system means economically) coerced to do those jobs. That's the status quo - it's a pretty damn low bar: anything better than threatening people with starving on the streets if they refuse a dangerous job is a win.\n\nWith that in mind, a big factor in Marx's thinking is the tendency of technology to replace 'brute force labor' - not sure if bricklaying is automated but you do kind of get the feel that many things that used to be done by many people exerting force on the world are now done by a single worker operating some heavy machinery. That's a way of saying 'the socially necessary labor goes down over time'.\n\nSo, yeah, there'll always be a 'crappy job' to do in comparison to others but one can think of a system in which progress in automating that job is not synonymous with leaving a trail of people who can't provide for themselves. And that is what would actually be different: a system in which all members of society are provided for, even if their line of work was phased out technologically.\n\nNow, you'll notice I talked a lot of stuff around your question and didn't answer it. Neither did Marx. There's no universal rule for 'how to make things work' - that's something that is super situation-dependent. It would be insanity to think that there is a 'universal formula' that makes people want to do shitty jobs. But that is the insane assumption we operate under a lot of the time - we think that our system, capitalism, has leveraged a sort of universal formula for this. That's why it's more useful to ask 'ok how does it work in detail nowadays' than to ask '(given the assumption that capitalism has a magic formula to make people do shitty jobs) what would be communism's alternative formula?'\n\nIn the end, many important aspects of communism arise from its practice, from its practice *in communitues*. So, eg it's much more relevant to ask how was waste management performed in the paris commune? Or, more contemporary without going into the USSR's obviously authoritarian sphere of influence, how would you and your neighborhood organize to take care of everyone if a natural disaster were to happen?\n\n(Natural disasters are a useful thought experiment because we usually put all of our free market intuition on hold when thinking about them)",

Equality with respect to compensation means inequality in rewarding effort, as you point out. The idea that there could be a perfectly just distribution of wealth based on labour time is what Marx calls \"bourgeois right\". Marx thinks this bourgeois right will persist into socialism, as workers attempt to recapture the value of their labour. But ultimately this attempt will fall into contradiction, since bourgeois right is already rendered superfluous by the generally socialised character of production in capitalism. However, Marx thinks the workers themselves will have to work through these contradictions, that they'll inevitably try to restore the bourgeois rights of labour. It's a subtle point he's making. It makes more sense if you read the actual Gotha program first, because a lot of people end up confusing the Critique with the actual program itself.",
