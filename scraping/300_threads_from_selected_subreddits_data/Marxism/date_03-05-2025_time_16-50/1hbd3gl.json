Sartre, Camus, Nietzsche etc. I think of it like this: Marx explains how we can achieve systematic freedom and self-development, and the existentialists delve further into what that development looks like in your own personal life. Marx looks at how society can promote the realization of the authentic self, whereas the existentialists describe authenticity and describe self-realization. I don't think every little detail fits completely neatly together between Marx and Existentialism, but there are some ideas that just work together. I think that is why Sartre became somewhat of a Marxist, although he didn't fully subscribe to all the ideas.",

Steven Jay Gould writes about evolutionary biology in ways that make sense intuitively to me, and it resembles a dialectic process. He writes about the theory of punctuated equilibrium, where a stasis will be reached for a notable period of time, and then rapid change when the stable process is undermined by internal and external contradictions. Then populations adapt to the emergent challenges and find new periods of stability. \n\nIt all rolls into my spiritual views, in which I see all life as one family with bonds that are rooted in dimensions beyond conscious perception. I think we are held back by Aristotelian & enlightenment methods of dissecting and categorizing everything. It's what has lead to the hyper-commodification we are facing, and has limits to the utility of healthy life.   \n  \nA lot is to be gained from spiritual exploration, practicing and exercising discipline and faith, revisiting ancestral practices, dreaming and creating; and spending time in the places beyond the everyday struggle is \\*crucial\\* for our health.",

However, while we live in a capitalist dominated world, Scotland needs to be independent to protect itself as much as possible from the capitalist forces that currently control it. Separating ourselves from England, and the treaties that it is bound to, is a good first step in this goal. Upon becoming independent, I would hope that Scotland can forge its own path and be an example for the world to follow and strive for greater ties with its neighbours in Scandinavia, Europe and, in time, a socialist world. \n\nIt'd be a bit like \"socialism in one country\" to begin with, except it would actually strive to create a socialist blueprint instead of being a cover for creating a tyrannical, autocratic, state that destroyed the first major attempt at creating a communist state. \n\nFor context, civic nationalism is different to ethnic nationalism.

I am firmly in the camp of Marxism and interpret her theories through a Marxist analysis, using what I understand to be corrected about her theories to sharpen how I understand Marxism, such as how she understands gender as a material structure of society, rather than just an identity. And criticizing what I think she's wrong about, such as her inability to understand how women's oppression is a byproduct how patriarchy developed out of class society rather than a product of men being ontologically evil.\n\nMost the people who are answering \"yes\" to your question don't really understand Marxism. The idea that two diametrically opposed ideologies such as Marxism and Nietzscheian post-modernism (using an example I saw in the comments) can be used interchangeably is what Marx criticized as dualism, it's kinda hard to explain what exactly dualism is in a couple of sentences but basically dualism believes that truth/the world is largely unknowable which is contrary to Marxism which believes we move closer to understanding the world through \"practice\", which is to say through the scientific method, two line struggle, class struggle and the struggle for the means of production.\n\nI'm happy to elaborate on anything if you have questions.",

I have also attempted to engage with both Catholicism (birth faith), Laveyan Satanism and Occultism (still haven't touched Ouija board) on a spiritual and mental level to try and get a sense of balance (Palpatine said \"if one is to understand the great mystery one must study all its aspects\"). I have also looked into other faiths like Bhuddism, Shintoism, Taoism and Confusianism to help gain that sense of inner feeling.",

Why do I struggle, when there is no vanguard, and no obvious way out of capitalism ahead? Because it is absurd. The purpose of struggle, with no end in sight, is because it is absurd. However, there is an end, and there are things to be done, unlike the absurd, i guess.",
