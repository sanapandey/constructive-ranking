    "selftext": "As today is #BastilleDay, I've put together a series of perspectives on the French Revolution from a working-class perspective. Here's Rosa Luxemburg's view on how the French Revolution. She shows that failure of the bourgeois class to realise its own aims, such as economic equality, led to conflict with its erstwhile allies, the propertyless and poor classes of France. However, those groups, as yet undeveloped as a working-class, meant that their class consciousness was not at a level of development required to take power. Additionally, the means of production were as yet undeveloped as the Industrial Revolution was just beginning. Ultimately, the working class could not yet take power, and the bourgeoisie could not achieve the abstract ideals on which the revolution was based. In Luxemburg's view, it requires a working class revolution to make a material reality of the idealist, abstract \"dreams\" of the otherwise \"well intentioned\" bourgeois Jacobins.\n\n[https://proletarianperspective.wordpress.com/2024/07/13/perspectives-on-the-french-revolution-rosa-luxemburg-on-the-year-1793/](https://proletarianperspective.wordpress.com/2024/07/13/perspectives-on-the-french-revolution-rosa-luxemburg-on-the-year-1793/)\n\n# July14 #14July #FrenchRevolution\n\n\n\n#   \n\n\n\n#     \n\n\n\n#   ",
