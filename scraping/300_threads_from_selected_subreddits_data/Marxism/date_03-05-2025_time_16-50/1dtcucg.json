I do not feel comfortable publically discussing the reasons for leaving the org since I don't want to air out the orgs dirty  laundry but would be happy to discuss it via private chat.\n\nBut where do I go?  Who do I join instead?  \n\nHow does one get organized if the organizations in your area are either politically weak or internally disfunctional?  How do vet an org you are thinking of joining to know if it has a healthy internal democratic centralist culture?  Is it ok to join a party if you don't agree with all of the party's public program?\n\nIs it worth it to stay with an imperfect org under the premise that it is better to be organized imperfectly than to not be organized at all?\n\nHelp.  \ud83d\ude2d.

We just had the launch of the Revolutionary Communist International. A large portion of that was the international school.\nThere are 19 recorded talks, it\u2019s a great way to learn our perspectives. Of those one is about Trotsky, and one is about socialism in one country versus internationalism.

At the first post Oct 7 pro-paleatine rally in my area, I went, and I saw the local IMT guys posted up and went over to say \"hi\", and ended up walking away with a pamphlet all about how Stalin was anti-semitic, and a zionist, and basically Hitler, and all that nonsense. And to feel like that is the most important information to be handing out at a Palestine rally? It almost seemed like self satire!. All I could think was: \"is this supposed to be irony or are you literally serious right now?\" \n\nI also feel like many Trotskyists spend too much effort hating Stalin personally, rather than actually looking at the many complicated circumstances and material conditions that were at play during his time in power. Like, I can appreciate the Maoist critiques of Stalin and the USSR after his death, because they do it in a principled way while still appreciating the situation. Every time I hear a speech from IMT they seem to have a deep personal vendetta against the guy. Or, take their views on Postmodernism... It's basically like Jordan Peterson making completely misunderstood and uninformed rants about cartoon versions of Postmodernism. But actually looking at the situation in France at the time, the intellectual climate, the problems they were having with their own CP and it's commitment to Stalin. Yeah, important critiques can and should be made, in a principled and nuanced way. Not just: \"Deleuze is just trying to confuse us and Foucault was a reactionary\", like, I think there's more to it than that. Or the final straw for me was the postcolonial stuff and going after Fanon as influencing reaction?? Or claiming that mutual aid is counter revolutionary? Do these people have ay idea how the Black Panthers became so powerful??!!  Idk. I just feel time after time like IMT and Trotskyists just dissapoint me and seem to want to disregard everything and every one besides their own insular versions of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Trotsky, and maaybe Luxemburg. Every other tendency is wrong... Like, I consider myself an ML, but I can see how other strategies and tendencies have been well suited to other situations. The Autonomist Marxism influenced Zapatistas (led by Subcomandante Marcos, who actually values Deleuze) in Chiapas, \u00d6calan's confederalism in Rojava, Huey Newton's Intercommunalism, the Maoists fighting in India and the Philippines, even modern China's overseeing of their own transition from feudalism through capitalism to socialism and eventually communism. You'd think Trotskyists would support that idea, don't they all believe that only industrially developed capatilist countries can succesfully transition to socialism?? China tried skipping that part and it didn't work... Now they're tying something else that they feel is suited to their own conditions and they're called dirty capitalist traitors? Don't get me wrong, there's plenty to critique there, but to disregard out of hand? Seems non materialist and non Marxist. We learn through testing theory through praxis, not by sitting back and shitting on anybody who tries. As many critiques as I have of Allende and some of his mistakes in Chile, he will always be a hero of mine. Some of Che's foco theory proved to often fail outside of Cuba, but we should still study and learn from it as well. And my limited experience with IMT was that the don't do anything like that. Let's just larp the Bolsheviks!! \n\nAnd to revisit the whole French theory thing: this is actually an idea from an American theorist, but one who is a huge Lacanian. He raises the idea that perhaps Marx's big mistake was not to underestimate people's propensity toward self interest, as many of Marx's critics would say. But instead, his mistake was to underestimate people's propensity toward self destruction. If we were really self interested we would have figured this stuff out already. And that's where all the fancy French guys talking about desire can be useful to a Marxist project. \n\nOf course we need to center class struggle, but we can still pull from wider theory pools in order to do so.",

You can have situations of old guard orgs led forever by someone high control and didn\u2019t adapt. You can have people with really disparate motives on why they\u2019re there. Strong personalities tend to show up first and that can be its own time and effort to turn into ground rules, agreements and community alignment. \n\nAnyway, one thought is there\u2019s a book that\u2019s a quick read and could be useful as a reverse engineering of reverse engineering. It\u2019s called Dedication and Leadership and it\u2019s this very short read by a man who had been part of the Communist Party in the UK I believe, which he later left and then joined the Catholic Church. The book is this whole thing about how the Communists were so good at building membership and bringing new people in and why couldn\u2019t the Catholic Church learn a thing or two from it. He\u2019s obtuse on not realizing the community/empathy part of the Communists, but does do a lot of good observation on systems and structures that created a very lean and easy to grow movement with dedicated members. \n\nThe reason I think it would be a good book to check out even though the author\u2019s view is ex-communist is that he\u2019s translating the ideas into something that sounds convincing and works with an audience who weren\u2019t into communism and even opposed it. There\u2019s language and framing there and translation into ways to talk to people in your community who might be opposed or aren\u2019t sold on this whole idea yet. He also translates systems that could be documented in communist handbooks from the past into something that might work in another context with some tweaking. Looking through the multiple lenses could be good brainstorming for what fits where you are. It\u2019s also a very short read, easy to find for free online, and some of the more conservative religious groups that still refer to that book actually did have a lot of success with creating low barrier to entry onboarding groups based on what that guy gleaned from the communist party. Would be both good to know what they do and also what hooks  could be used for positive social change instead. \n\nAnd last thought, if anything, you can try kicking off a reading group based on one book that would be self-selecting for the kind of people you\u2019re looking for. Even just getting the same people in a room can lead to lots of trading info on who is organizing what where. Same principle can apply to a community college class based on adjacent topics.",

Constantly putting themselves against the masses thinking that\u2019s what being  the vanguard means. \n\nPSL candidates straight up lie to people saying no reform is possible under capitalism so vote for us. \nThis is toxic and disregards the entire theory and history of Leninism and the international\nCommunist movement.\n\nDSA is increasingly just a debate club where each faction writes blog posts to argue that their position is the best. The NPC is constantly embroiled in infighting. The so-called \u201ccommunist caucus\u201d cries about people voting. \n\n\nLeftists constantly talk about militancy but if an organization tries to instill any kind of discipline they cry that they\u2019re being persecuted. \n\nPlease, no matter what organization you are part of, meet the working class where they are and understand that only through engaging in struggle for better conditions do people gain class consciousness and only through us communist\u2019s engaging with them in their struggles  and we impact revolutionary consciousness.\n\nIn the short term, yes, that means getting out the vote against the MAGA right. If that is too unpalatable for you, you are not cut out for political organizing.",

Without this, a party worthy of the name cannot be built, and we are building it. We have succeeded in putting the views of our two currents truthfully, clearly, and distinctly before everyone. Personal bitterness, factional squabbles and strife, scandals, and splits\u2014all these are trivial in comparison with the fact that the experience of two tactics is actually teaching a lesson to the proletarian masses, is actually teaching a lesson to everyone who is capable of taking an intelligent interest in politics.\"",

Ppl too quickly get embarrassed and turtle in at the least ammount of discussion. DSA is a very problematic organization, probably due to very heavy infiltration, imo, and no clear Leninst line, but not because of the squabbling, but because of infiltrators using squabbling and leadership tolerating Liberals.",

The org allows open factionalism and internal organizing. Whereas the party also serves to train up the class to be fit to rule, membership control and open debate is essential.",
