I also am a strong believer in Communism - I know the 2 have a bad past (specifically the persecution of orthodox Christian\u2019s under the USSR) but I wanted to come here to ask: is there a contradiction in believing in both? I know Karl Marx called religion an opium of the people so I\u2019m not sure\u2026 thanks comrades!",

There I don't think it's productive for Marxists to ram atheism down people's throats. You're unlikely to win over workers who believe in God by doing that.\n\nHowever what we do believe is that we do not hope and wish for a paradise after we are dead: we hope, wish, and fight for a paradise on earth for the living, and that is communism after the socialist revolution.\n\nWe do indeed believe *organised* religion is a reactionary tool used to keep the bourgeoisie in power. *But* faith for the individual worker is a private matter.\n\nI say, so long as you want to see capitalism overthrown and you want to help build a world where there is no more hunger, greed, war, and suffering, then you are a communist and whether you believe in God or not is irrevelant.\n\nHope that helps, comrade.",

The question is will people democratically decide that or could a church even have enough believers after the revolution.\n\nIf you look at Russia, the church was tied by a thousand threads to the Tsarist regime. It became totally discredited in the eyes of workers when the revolution came, as Nicholas the Bloody showed his true colours and the church supported him to the hilt. Workers came to hate the church not because they hated religion, but because they rightly associated the church with the hated regime.\n\nThe same dynamic played out in Spain during the Civil War: the Vatican backed Franco and the fascists, and ordinary Spaniards turned on the church accordingly. It also worked the other way: there were some (not many, but some) cases of priests who left the priesthood and joined the side of the revolution. Because priests were more in touch with the mood of the masses than the bishops and cardinals were, and some found themselves agreeing more with what their congregations were saying than their bishops and archbishops.\n\nAfter the socialist revolution I would see no need in banning any church, except if a church was supporting the counter-revolutionary forces, but eventually I don't think there'd be a need for a church. Once a communistic society is built and class inequality is a thing of the past, I see no material basis for people to hold onto such belief systems, which belong to the pre-communist age.",

In effect it would need be willing to become socialist Church. It would need integrated into its faith and view the religion a socialist perspective. It would need to purge it's inside and out of all reactionary and bigoted views and fight it's internal reaction or tendencies itself.\n\nThe Orthodox Church probably has an easier time doing this than say the Catholic Church. Since decisions in the church are done via consensus rather than the decisions of an individual. But basically there would need to be a revolution within the church at the same time as there's revolution outside the church. The rank and file would need to replace every Patriarch, Bishop, Deacon, Priest, ECT that does not submit to the new socialist theology. The Church itself would need to be democratized with congregation having more of a say on church policy and appointments. \n\nBasically you're going to schism within the church in order for the church to work within the socialist system. This would involve for example in Russia ending the federation of Tzar Siants or the spreading of reactionary ideas. They would also have to accept the right of people to not follow their religion and stop attempting to spread it. Recognize that is undermining peoples right to have of their own religion or do not have one.\n\nBasically it's possible but the church will be unrecognizable. The church was founded out of slave and feudal societies and therefore is entirely covered by the birthmarks of those areas. It would need to rid itself of these to not be a threat to the new society.\n\nIf the current church is on unwilling then new church will be established by those believers that recognizes the need for a new day.\n\nSorry if this sounds harsh. Unfortunately the Orthodox Church had been probably the most reactionary religious organization in modern history. It would need to do a lot to escape that past and move into the new future.",

Under communism, in his opinion, religion would gradually disappear as unnecessary. At the same time, he himself did not call for a radical struggle with religiosity. Lenin, in turn, is already talking about religion-opium, in the context of a \"drug\" designed to stupefy people and considers the church as an institution for controlling people. From a certain point of view, he was right. But the church is people, they can be wrong. His views were largely shaped by the reality of the Russian Empire and the Church of those years, personal grievances and the spirit of the time when science and religion were considered incongruous things. But those days are over. Today, many religious people no longer consider faith as the opposite of science and focus on it as a spiritual teaching, rather than a history textbook about the creation of the world. In itself, the religious teaching of Christians is quite close to communism. The ideas of love for one's neighbor, compassion, justice, silverlessness, etc. correlate quite well with the desire for a fair distribution of benefits. Personally, I am convinced that these two teachings, although they have different approaches to some issues, nevertheless are not contradictory and may well coexist, perhaps not without discussion. Unfortunately, there are quite a few people who will tell you the opposite here in a very rude way.",

            "body": "So if you understand religion in the context of Marxism- you'll see that religion is to capitalism, what god is to capital ownership. That being said- humans are spiritual beings, and if you find purpose in that, than you do you. But if you think your religion can be used to justify your politics- then you might wanna work on separating the two. I'll explain the historical context of religion from a marxist view, and maybe you'll see what I'm trying to say.\n\nSo- we have the topic of Base, and Superstructure. \"Base\" refers to the economic foundation of a society. Base is \"how goods are produced, and how we socially reconcile that\". Base determines the material conditions of society and influences all other aspects of human life.\n\nThen, we have \"Superstructure\", this is the political systems and ideologys that arise as a consequence of a societys \"base\" structure. Basically, this is the \"government\".\n\nSo, if we look at Feudalism- the base was centered around agriculture. Agriculgure requires land to till, and therefore, he who owned land- was king. He who tilled the soil, were surfs. Religion rose up to be a superstructure for Feudalism. This is because a structure had to exist that determined who was right to rule. In feudalistic times- the pope had the power to point to a king, and say \"god agrees with your claim to power- you are the rightful king\". The surfs would hear this proclamation, and respect the kings right to rule. Religion, in this system- was the government, and the structure around religion was build up strongly over the centuries to support this.\n\nThen, we have society's switch to Capitalism. In a capitalist society, the Base is capital ownership. He who owns the machines, are king (CEO in this case). He who works the machines, are surfs (working class). The superstructure is our government- but more specifically- they are neoliberalistic actors. The people who write laws that legitimize our persute of expanding capital. In this case, the president is \"pope\", and chooses through policy which industrys to prop up.\n\nSo, to go back to the question- how is religion factored into Marxism- the answer is that religion is a husk of the reminisce of the previous system. It's a holdover from Feudalism. It no longer has the power it once had, but the superstructure is still strongly built upon- and hasn't yet phased out. Marx predicts that a similar effect would be seen after the collapse of capitalism- where capitalistic pursuit might still have an echoing effect in the next system- but will ultimately phase out. Basically- old superstructure runs on the fumes of the last system in place, and theological religions are currently that fume.\n\nNow, here is the interesting thing- these old superstructures can have power in society- but won't hold a candle to the base or current superstructure. We see attempts from religious groups trying to impact policy all the time- but the only time these attemps are effective is when It serves the economy. So, the Superstructure of religion has slightly adapted itself to be alligned on that axis in an attempt to remain relivent. Additionally- humans are spiritual by nature, which also aids this fact. But in the grand scheme- it'll become irrelevant (maybe not in our lifetimes though).\n\nIn conclusion though- I stick to my initial statement. If you find personal importance in your religion- go for it. You have a right as an individual to your own beliefs.",

Orthodoxy, with its emphasis on hierarchy and tradition, directly clashed with Communism's focus on class struggle and revolutionary change.\n\nThat said, some argue there are shared values, like concern for the poor and community solidarity.   \n  \nBut the deeper conflict lies in their ultimate goals:   \n  \nOrthodoxy looks to eternal salvation, while Communism seeks to create a utopia on Earth.   \n  \nBalancing both beliefs would require redefining aspects of one or the other, which is why they\u2019ve historically struggled to coexist.",

It's likely a matter of how to go about it.\n\nFor Orthodox Christians, the idea of making life better on earth is often tied to living out Christ\u2019s teachings\u2014showing love, compassion, and care for others through giving of charity.\n\nIt\u2019s about addressing material needs without losing sight of spiritual ones, seeking a balance between improving physical conditions and fostering moral and spiritual growth.\n\nThe \"how\" varies, but many Orthodox teachings emphasize communal responsibility and voluntary acts of charity rather than enforced systems.  Efforts to improve life might involve creating supportive communities, helping the poor and oppressed, and ensuring fairness in how resources are shared, all while respecting individual freedom and dignity.   \n  \nThe ultimate goal is a better world that reflects the Kingdom of God\u2014where both material and spiritual needs are met in harmony.\n\nCommunism, on the other hand, approaches the idea of a better life through a materialist lens, focusing on the redistribution of wealth, collective ownership of resources, and the abolition of class hierarchies which ultimately must be enforced through State power. \n\nIts goal is to create a society where economic inequality is eliminated, and everyone contributes according to their abilities and receives according to their needs. In theory, this sounds appealing, especially for addressing systemic injustices and poverty.\n\nHowever, in practice, communism often struggles with its implementation. Historically, centralized systems of control have led to abuses of power, suppression of personal freedoms, and inefficiencies.\n\nThe focus on material conditions alone can neglect the deeper spiritual, cultural, and moral needs of people, which many Orthodox Christians would argue are just as essential for a fulfilling life.   \n  \nI'm sure we'll get it right eventually.",

The full quote is much more emphatic (and in my view more interesting as well):\n\n\"The foundation of a critique of religion is this: It is humanity that creates religion, not the other way around. Religion is an expression of human self-awareness and self-esteem, especially when people have either not yet found themselves or have lost themselves again. But humans do not exist as abstract beings outside the world. Humans are part of the human world \u2013 the state, society. It is precisely this state and society that produce religion, a distorted way of seeing the world, because they themselves are distorted. Religion becomes a comprehensive theory of the world, a kind of popular logic, a moral guarantee, a source of enthusiasm and comfort, a sacred justification for humanity\u2019s situation. Religion is a fantasy representation of humanity, created because human reality lacks true freedom and fulfillment.\n\nTo challenge religion is, therefore, to simultaneously challenge the world whose spiritual reflection it represents.\n\nReligious suffering is both an expression of humanity\u2019s real suffering and a protest against that suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of a soulless condition. It is the opium of the people.\n\nAbolishing religion as the false happiness of the people means demanding their real happiness. If people are to give up their illusions about their condition, they must also change the conditions that create the need for those illusions. Critique of religion is thus just the beginning of a critique of a world full of suffering \u2013 a world where religion serves as the glorified reflection of something better.\"\n\nThere are also christian authors that have views similar to that of Marx.

If someone makes up new rules or believes rules that are part of their denomination, but are not in the Bible, well then you are off-base.\n\nThere is a lot in the Bible, OT and NT, directly or in context, that acknowledges that, basically, each person / family are to make their own way in life. And, that you ought to be industrious at endeavors that create wealth / bring you wealth.\n\nA corollary to this is that being lazy is not good. This is clearly in the Bible.\n\nThe Nukular Family is obviously a Biblical principle. In Marxism, the Nukular Family is a creation of the prevailing oprpessive hegemony designed to hold power for those who already have the power, and keep others out of getting access to power. Same for religion: per Marxism, it is a social invention meant to get all of us have-nots to buyt the beliefs of the Haves so that we are happy with the overall social structure.\n\nThis is why Marxists express surprise that all of us low income people love our capitalism, claiming that any one of us could rise to be a millionaire. Marxists think it is dumb for us to believe this; that we have been sold a pipe dream so that we will not be upset that there are millionaires out there oppressing us all of the time.\n\nIn Christianity, there is a place for charity. A big place. In Marxism, that is basically taken away, and replaced with the govt deciding how to mete out meager charity.\n\nChristian giving / charity is the world's biggest charity force in the world. Ever. In the US, we American Christians giving to other countries is greater than the US Govt foreign aide, each year.\n\nSo, a Christian can decide, \"I do not need the govt to step in and govern charity.\" Marxism cannot accept that, however. Not at all. And, Marxists want Govt to interfere with our practice of religion by getting involved by way of taxes. Govt should leave me alone to practice my religion, including leaving alone the money I donate to my church. Marxists hate that. \n\nIf you take a talent and invest it, and your return is 100 times greater, God is not upset with you, relative to your neighbor taking a talent and getting a return of 10x. In fact, the Bible will suggest you may have been a bit foolish to not look for opportunities to build wealth with your capital / stored-economic-capital.\n\n\\[Marxists hate these examples because for Marxists the creation of wealth out of nothing but land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship, plus govt support of currency and free trade and property rights, really burns them up.\n\nIf I can cut down a tree in my back yard, carve 100 crucifixes in a nice way, with my labor and a pocket knife, and go sell them at $5 a piece for Christmas gifts, to people who willingly hand over the $5, and I make $500, and make 100 people happy on Christmas morning, Marxists hate this to no end. I cannot find anything remotely suggesting that the Judeo-Christian God of the Bible would have any problem.\\]\n\nPrices determined jointly by supply and demand is in the Bible. Price-regulation is not. Neither is any sort of standardized or established wage.\n\nThere is a lot in the Bible about mutually-agreed-upon-and-binding contracts. God favors these. In fact, God uses quite a few with us. And, all of the stuff about going to the city gates or having two witnesses is context referring to how contracts were to be made. And, God wants us to honor our contracts. Including with private property and labor agreements.\n\nYou have to read the Bible looking for this stuff to find it. You also have to know some cultural context, such as how illiterate people made binding contracts about property that stood recognized across generations.\n\nYou also have to honestly study Marxism.",
