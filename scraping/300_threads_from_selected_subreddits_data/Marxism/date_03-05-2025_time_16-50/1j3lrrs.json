    "selftext": "I've heard conflicting opinions as to whether one should just go straight into reading Marx, and even Capital itself, or ease themselves in with other material. I know I personally find Marx's Victorian-era writing and subject matter to be a bit impenetrable from what I have read of it, so I'd personally hope for something to lay the groundwork beforehand. I don't want to waste my time reading Marx himself just to not understand (or misunderstand) it, after all. But since you're relying on someone's second-hand interpretation of his work, I want to make sure it's accurate.\n\nSo, what should I go with, if anything? Just in regards to Marx' general thought, I've found a (probably non-exhaustive) list of options:\n\n* Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution\n* What Marx Really Meant\n* Why Marx Was Right\n* Karl Marx: His Life and Work\n* Karl Marx: His Life and Environment\n* The Meaning of Marxism\n* Understanding Marxism\n* Marxism and Freedom: from 1776 Until Today\n* Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence\n* A World to Win: the Life and Works of Karl Marx\n* Introduction to Marx\n\nAny preferences from this list? \"Marxism and Freedom\" sounds interesting, but probably a bit more opinionated.\n\nAnd when we get to introductions to Capital in particular, and not just Marx's work in general, there's more options:\n\n* Marx\u2019s Capital: An Illustrated Introduction\n* A Companion to Marx\u2019s Capital\n* How to Read Marx's Capital: Commentary and Explanations on the Beginning Chapters\n* An Introduction to the Three Volumes of Karl Marx's Capital\n* Understanding Marx\u2019s Capital: A reader\u2019s guide\n* Karl Marx's Das Kapital: A modern-day interpretation of an economic classic\n\nAnd that's not even getting into abridgements of Capital like the Oxford abridged edition, or the Grundrisse, or the companion to the Grundrisse by David Harvey!\n\nNow when it comes to Marx's work itself things get a bit clearer as I know I want to pick up something like the Marx-Engels reader and work through that, with help from the MIA to fill in the gaps. But when it comes to handling Capital, or if I should read supplemental stuff beforehand or even simultaneously, I get lost.\n\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

            "body": "Capital has a lot of philosophy imbued in it. It isn't merely an economic text. If you don't have a good understanding of dialectical and historical materialism you won't fully capture the essence of the text. Reading others' thoughts on marxism is all fine and well, but don't base your understanding of marxism solely on theirs. Think for yourself and come to your own conclusions. What I will say is that there's no replacement for the original texts. They're still relevant today, as we're still living under capitalism. I'd recommed reading these texts as an introduction, but don't just read them. Take your time to digest the content and I find that joining a local book club that may hold reading groups on any of these texts might help. \n\n-Communist Manifesto (the most basic introductory text)\n-Socialism: Utopian and Scientific\n-The origins of the family, private property and the state\n-Dialectics of nature\n\nThese are a good place to start in my opinion.",

It is perhaps the most comprehensive overview of Marxism in so short a document, and is infused with Lenin\u2019s distinctive polemical vein; here, as in all of his writings, Lenin defends the international and revolutionary essence of Marxism at a time when the majority of the leaders of the Second International were contorting Marx\u2019s teachings into a doctrine of reformism and lining up behind their ruling classes in the First World War.  \n\n\n>& - In 1939, Longmans published The Living Thoughts of Karl Marx, Based on Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Presented by Leon Trotsky. The following text served as the introduction to this one-volume abridgement of Marx\u2019s Capital. The abridgement itself was made by Otto R\u00fchle, \u201cwith profound understanding of his task.\u201d Trotsky\u2019s introduction appeared separately as a pamphlet, and is presented here, with slight modifications, in Charles Malamuth\u2019s translation.

With all due respect it would have helped if you also listed the authors of the works as so many titles are similar.\n\nIn any case, I would recommend starting with \"A people's guide to capitalism\" by Hadas Thier for a ELI5 explanation of Marx economic theories. That will prepare you for the more let's say algebra-heavy parts of Capital.\n\n\"Economic and Philosophic manuscripts of 1844\" by Marx himself is a good introduction to Marxist philosophy. This text was not published until the 1930s and changed the way that people intepreted Capital, because this text clarifies some key concepts like alienation. A caveat is that this text was written by the \"early\" Marx and these concepts are developed or adjusted in later texts.\n\n\"The Jewish Question\" is another influential text that outlines some of Marx thoughts around emancipation through state power. It's controversial because some scholars interpret it as antisemitic but if you know Marx' writing style I don't think that's true (at all).\n\nLastly Michael Heinrich's introduction to Capital is widely regarded as a good place to start, you can read up on NML or Neomarxism to understand the contect of this interpretation, personally I think it is great and much closer to the original meaning of the text than many other intepretations.\n\nAt the end of the day you will of course have to engage with the original text and make your own conclusions. Intepretations or summaries are by definition characterised by different emphases and new works come out from time to time that will add a new angle (look up S\u00f8ren Mau for example). So the best course of action is probably to read as much as possible.",
