However, I've finally decided to buy the actual book. Now, the print by MIT is ridiculously expensive. I simply refuse to pay that. However, the one by Verso Books and the one by Merlin Press I've read negative reviews about, mainly regarding errors in the text. Does anyone here have any experience with the latter two versions of the English translation? It's half the price of the MIT one, but I'm afraid I'll purchase a commodity with no use-value.\n\nThanks in advance \\^\\^",
