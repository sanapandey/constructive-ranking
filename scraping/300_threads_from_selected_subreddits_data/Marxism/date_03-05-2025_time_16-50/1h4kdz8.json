    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am new to seriously reading Marxist and all adjacent ideologies. In my brief time reading, I have come to really sympathize with the writings. Because of this, I was wondering if there are any suggestions as to find local groups to talk with about the writings. I think online tools may be the most useful way in finding these groups, but so far I have had no luck. Nobody in my Union seems interested in discussing these topics with me either.\n\nIf there is not a good way to reach other Marxists online then my plan is to reserve space in a library or someplace similar and invite people from my union (though my previously mentioned efforts may spell doom for this approach) or perhaps I can hang flyers at the library or around some public spaces. While this approach is not very effective either I do believe I have to try.\n\nAny suggestions you guys have will be greatly appreciated!",

            "body": "Probably better to start with your union buddies honestly. A lot of Marxists in \"Marxist groups\" are morons frankly who actually read very little Marx. Maybe try to find like minded rank and filers from other unions as well. I realize this is vague but it's hard to really give a solid answer without knowing where you live or what union you're in and I'm not going to ask you to identify yourself like that.",

There are likely books on the battles that your union fought, that may give insight into the tactics that worked or why working conditions are as they are today. Many unions that are today conservative have had a radical history that provided the victories people take for granted today.",
