    "selftext": "I'm reading Sheldon Wolin's \"Democracy Incorporated\" and **(political readings in general)** it refers to a lot of vague collusions with the government and corporate actors to economically demoralize and weaken the citizenry via conscious price hikes and active inaction.\n\nWhen discussing the finance-state apparatus with the \"uninitiated\" \"normies\" I use the same assumptions, namely healthcare increasing prices, the gutting of the social security and stuff like that, which directly cause people living paycheck to paycheck. Then CNN enjoyer will say:\n\n\\*\\*\"like what?\" and I'm like...\"2007 loans, and Reagan era stuff\" then they'll go \"\\*\\****Yeah but what about now?*** **Biden just spent millions on infrastructure and healthcare and education, the government cares\" and I'm like \"well inflation\" and they'll go \"Yeah he just did the inflation act, inflation isn't intentional it's just hard times right now\" and I say \"well under the democrats, roe v wade got overturned\" and then they'll say \"but the democrats mean well, it's just that damn supreme court!\"**\n\nBasically I'm struggling to find real world examples of class conflict that go beyond the obvious, and can give credit to theoretical explanations of capitalism, **specifically in the imperial core**. It's obvious that things are shitty for people right now, **but the visible and conscious class incentives are not obvious**. Can anyone help me with this?",

You are trying to create a one-sided view instead of looking at things dialectically. \n\nBiden is part of the bourgeois government, but his base also includes labor and progressive forces.\n\nIt is a mistake to think we live in some sort of autocracy where we have no legal means to act politically. We have the right to assemble and to vote. It makes a big difference. \n\nThe two parties are both capitalist parties but their bases are different. Even the capitalists that fund them are at times very different in their ideology. Trump represents the most reactionary elements of the capitalist class which creates all sorts of astroturfed campaigns to rile up their racist and misogynist base.\n\nRevolution comes from fighting hand-in-hand with the CNN watchers and other regular folks who do not have revolutionary or even class consciousness. We build that through struggle. We don\u2019t minimize the threat of Right to Work becoming federal law because we live under capitalism either way. We have to protect and expand our democratic rights and win gains for the working class. Only through that work, by tasting those victories, do we build revolutionary consciousness and a revolutionary movement. \n\nhttps://www.cpusa.org/article/anti-monopoly-democracy-a-transitional-stage/",

There is no shortage of suffering directly caused by capitalism, in \u201cthe imperial core\u201d and outside.\u00a0\n\nIn your debate you lost because you gave a shitty argument from the standpoint of a reformist and then lost to the reformists.\n\nThis quote entirely applies to you:\n\n>The passage which really makes Marx spit blood, containing as it does some Lassallean rubbish about the \"Free State\" and the \"iron law of wages\", ends with what Marx (and Engels in another passage) call \"the indefinite concluding phrase of the paragraph\"; here it is: \u00abThe party strives for the abolition of\u00a0exploitation\u00a0in every form and for the removal of all social and political equality\u00bb.\n\n\n>Here, according to Marx and Engels, is what they should have said instead: \u00abWith the abolition of class distinctions, all forms of social and political inequality arising from them will disappear of their own accord\u00bb.\n\n\n\n>This scientific way of talking \u2013 not to mention the long critical note on the equal distribution formula, which is compared to the bourgeois insinuation that socialism cannot abolish poverty but only generalize it to everybody \u2013 is enough in itself to dispose of a whole gamut of reviews and articles which \u2013 alas! \u2013 are being written, in the years 1956\u20117, about the\u00a0content of socialism\u00a0as a\u00a0philosophy of exploitation.\n\n\n\n>In the same passage Marx also deals with the limitations of Lassalle\u2019s vision \u2013 which, significantly, he links to Malthusian theories, today restored to life by the American, anti\u2011Marxist \"welfarist\" schools \u2013 according to which socialism is roused to action only inasmuch as the workers\u2019 wages are frozen at too low a level; whereas in fact it is a matter of abolishing wage\u2011labour because \u00abit is a system of slavery \u2013 a slavery which becomes more severe in proportion as the social forces of labour productivity develop,\u00a0whether or not the worker is paid well, or badly\u00bb.\n\n\n\n>Here Marx develops a historical parallel with the slave-economy (one we touched on earlier when discussing the idiotic demand for wage\u2011earners\u2019 autonomy): \u00abit is as if, among slaves who have finally got behind the secret of slavery and broken out in rebellion, one slave, still in thrall to obsolete notions, were to inscribe on the programme of rebellion [an immediatist, Ordinovist, non\u2011Marxist slave we should say]: slavery must be abolished because the feeding of slaves in the system of slavery cannot exceed a certain low maximum!\u00bb\n\n\n\n>To the \"welfarist\" gentlement we say: even if capitalism could increase average living standards to the umpteenth degree, we reiterate to you our historic prediction: capitalism\u2019s death!\n\n\n\nhttp://www.international-communist-party.org/basictexts/english/57Fundam.htm",

It's beyond what happened with any individual world leader - in Canada, people blame Trudeau for it. Potentially much more the case was that historically low interest rates for decades lead to too much growth in the overall money supply, not just the government's part in it. That includes all the debt individuals are taking on through credit cards, home loans, and all the corporate debt taken out. That isn't Biden's fault, as the overnight rate is set by the Federal Reserve - and it can't really be called the 'fault' of the federal reserve when they just react to economic conditions.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0The supreme Court, again, is outside the direct control of the federal government.\u00a0 What you're essentially getting mad about is that the US president isn't a dictator, which, trust me, you'll be happy about the next time a republican is elected. Even a democratic dictator (whose been in office for *54 freakin' years*) ain't much to write home about.\n\n\nOverall I'm honestly unsure of what exactly you're looking for here. What do you mean by \"real examples of class conflict that go beyond the obvious\"? Do you mean organizing and unionizing efforts in workplaces such as Starbucks and Walmart? Changes in government policy towards things like universal healthcare or universal post secondary tuition?\u00a0\n\n\nLastly, what exactly do you mean by \"the visible and conscious class interests are not obvious\" ?",
