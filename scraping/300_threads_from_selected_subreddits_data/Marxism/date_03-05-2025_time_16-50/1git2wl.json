    "selftext": "Marx quoted\n\n\u201cCapital is said by a Quarterly Reviewer to fly turbulence and strife, and to be timid, which is very true; but this is very incompletely stating the question. Capital eschews no profit, or very small profit, just as Nature was formerly said to abhor a vacuum. With adequate profit, capital is very bold. A certain 10 per cent. will ensure its employment anywhere; 20 per cent. certain will produce eagerness; 50 per cent., positive audacity; 100 per cent. will make it ready to trample on all human laws; 300 per cent., and there is not a crime at which it will scruple, nor a risk it will not run, even to the chance of its owner being hanged. If turbulence and strife will bring a profit, it will freely encourage both. Smuggling and the slave-trade have amply proved all that is here stated.\u201d (T. J. Dunning, l. c., pp. 35, 36.)\n\nThis is from \"Trades' unions and strikes: their philosophy and intention\" book, which was published in 1860, while Das Kapital was published in 1867. What was the meaning of \"Capital\" in the quoted book if it's not Marx's definition of Capital? \n\nAlso, when Marx quoted this, did he want the reader to comprehend Capital as in his definition or the quoted author's definition?\n\n",

Marx drew from the terms as defined by capitalist, but provided greater precision and thoroughness. Neoclassical economics has a muddled definition of capital (see the Cambridge capital controversy), but the practical capitalists in the business schools and trade magazines have a practical understanding more akin to Marx\u2019s usage.",

                            "body": "The crucial thing for Marx is that capital is in motion and therefore has a temporal dimension that is usually ignored by economists for whom it is understood as a fixed magnitude. Once any of its \u201cmoments\u201d becomes terminal, for Marx, capital ceases to be capital. Thus we can speak of some quantity of money or means of production as \u201ccapital,\u201d but not if that money is taken out of the circuit of accumulation as a hoard or if the means of production are idled. The difference in approach has deep roots that should be wrestled with if you want to understand the project at a deep level - the German tradition in philosophy and above all in Hegel is more comfortable with process ontologies as opposed to ones based on essence or substance. (Marx\u2019s categories in general work like this, in that relations are not accidental but immament. By less explicitly political analogy, you can see Darwin\u2019s revision of the natural sciences just in this way, in that \u201cspecies\u201d cease to have any reality outside of the process of speciation)",

As Marx writes in _Capital_ v1 ch6: \n\n> \u201cwe shall see, not only how capital produces, but how capital is produced. We shall at last force the secret of profit making.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, the Wikipedia definition derives from the neoclassical definition which I always said is a muddled one (muddled in the Nineteenth Century and today). The practical capitalists\u2014business school economists, finance journalists, and financiers\u2014more match Marx\u2019s definition: money, instruments of production (a.k.a.\u201cdurable produced goods\u201d Wikipedia mentions), raw materials, work in progress, and inventoried finished commodities as they participate in a capital process (M\u2013C\u2013M\u2032 in all its elaborate forms, or in its simplest form, M\u2013M\u2032). Marx leaned on Engels (as a practicing capitalist) to hone his definitions, though those definitions always became richer From Marx\u2019s critical analysis.\n\nThough it is common, within the capitalist ideology, to think of means of production as necessarily and always capital (contra Marx\u2019s much more precise nomenclature).",

But he seems also (as Marx does) to center his criticism less on individual capitalists themselves, and more on the self-perpetuating pressure that capital exerts on its owners or agents to fulfill its imperative.",
