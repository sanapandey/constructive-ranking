    "selftext": "Hello Comrades and Friends, we've written a new article on BRICS, and what is represents. \n\n  \nA little excerpt:   \n\"Multi-polarity, viewed soberly, is not more, than the **logical antithesis** to the West's weakening **hegemony over global trade, credit and currency**.It offers the possibility of an **alternative to the Western order** that did not exist before.  \nTurning away from the previous order is a progressive step, because this old order is a reactionary one. To see progress only in the beginning of socialist construction is to close one's eyes to the fact that **the development of a progressive state in the context of the old Western organisations is almost impossible.** The BRICS and multipolarity are **neither good nor bad** in themselves, because they make no difference to the oppressed peoples of the world. Therefore, it is **wrong to see BRICS as anything more than an opportunity** for the peoples of the world and the states they may represent to liberate themselves from the old, seemingly more violent order. It is this **opportunity that gives rise to the potential of the BRICS** to create the space for states to pursue their **self-determination through unconditional trade** \\- this says nothing about the character of these individual states.\u201d\n\nYou can read the article [here. ](https://kritikpunkt.com/2025/01/10/brics-eine-chance-kein-ziel/)  \nFind Kritikpunkt-Magazine on Instagram[ here. ](https://www.instagram.com/kritik_punkt/)",

            "body": "We had multipolarity in the 19th century. That didn't lead to peace and socialism, but to destruction and barbarism in 1914.\n\nMultipolarity is at bottom just saying \"multiple imperialist powers is better than one imperialist power.\"\n\nWell, as marxists, surely *no* imperialist power is better than *any* imperialist power.\n\nThe proletariat in all countries can and should rely only on their own strength in fighting capitalism and imperialism. They can put zero faith in the bourgeoisie of any country, even if that bourgeoisie is against US imperialism. Because the bourgeoisie which is against US imperialism is one which wants a slice of the pie which the US carves up for itself.\n\nEdit: You also write about Western imperialism as if its cruelty and violence is a question of policy or \"character\" of the western imperialist governments. This is a completely idealist and therefore un-Marxian view. The USA and other western powers are violent *because* they have become imperialists. They didn't become imperialists because they have some inherent violent mindset. It is Marxism 101 that imperialism is an inevitable stage of capitalist development, and the bourgeoisie will defend its profits and position of power with force if need be. This is true of the bourgeois class of *all* countries, not just the USA and NATO. Supporting BRICS just because it is a counter-weight to US hegemony isn't Marxism, it's social-chauvinism but in reverse. I.e., rather than cheering on your own bourgeoisie (social-chauvinism), you cheer on the bourgeoisie of a rival power. This standpoint is a complete abandonment of an internationalist, proletarian class position. Your last sentence says it all: \"create the space for states to pursue their self-determination through unconditional trade\". I.e., through capitalist relations. You're literally supporting capitalism over socialism.",

Whatever your opinion on it, it is objectively true that thus far the BRI hasn't engaged in debt-trap diplomacy and seems to be a genuine effort by the CPC to  develop the global south in a way which is mutually beneficial for China's geopolitical interests.\n\nlike the cold war was a multipolar world, for all of the Soviet Union's problems a multipolar world with a major socialist power is much preferable to one with a single imperialist power like the US. The multipolar world of 1914 was entirely imperialist powers.\n\nBRICS is also a block of countries with **competing** interests if anything, Russia is arguably a full blown imperialist power while India is a typical capitalist country. China and India do not get on at all and the Russian-Chinese alliance at the moment is quite fragile. BRICS isn't really a coherent block like NATO or the G7 which is made up entirely of capitalist countries in the american sphere of influence. BRICS isn't \"Chinese NATO\" or anything of the sort. One can support BRICS as a counterweight to the alternative, which is the US dominating the entire global trade system, while being critical of the countries within it.\n\nLike there's not really any evidence that China is interested in being a traditional imperial power. For one thing they aren't developing their military to anywhere near the size it would need to be to maintain one, despite having the economic means of doing so.\n\n\\>\"create the space for states to pursue their self-determination through unconditional trade\". I.e., through capitalist relations. You're literally supporting capitalism over socialism.\n\nThe BRI is offering better terms for these countries. The west engages in debt-trap diplomacy and is largely uninterested in trading or investing in the global south other than for base resource extraction, i.e. imperialism. It's utopian to think that in the present day underdeveloped countries can somehow move beyond a capitalist mode of production while still engaging in global trade. Ultimately these countries need resources to develop and they will need to work within the global capitalist system to do this. The BRI at present offers the best terms to these countries which is why they have been so willing to engage with it, and just happens to be offered by a socialist state.",

They don't need to make the largest military in the world to use it as a threat.\n\nChina does not care about developing the south to help it achieve socialism, they just want cheap access to resources to help their own markets, and make the south dependant on them.",

The traditional model of imperialism required political domination of colonised countries to prevent them doing this. Britain flooded its goods into India while effectively banning the development of proper Industry in the country, and of course preventing India from creating tariffs against the UK. China isn't doing this, nor could it with its current military strength.\n\nThe BRI isn't about trade for commodities anyway, it's about infrastructure investment - something the traditional imperialist powers consistently failed to offer to global south countries. China was already the world's leading manufacturer before the BRI. The BRI is a flow of chinese capital (most of which is provided by SOEs) into other countries, primarily aimed at infrastructure investment, and at least so far has offered quite good terms to these countries. This is pretty much the opposite of the traditional imperialist model, if anything.\n\n[The idea that the BRI has been about debt-trap diplomacy, at least to date, is a myth.](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/08/debunking-myth-debt-trap-diplomacy/4-sri-lanka-and-bri)",

And by that I mean both the workers and bourgeoise of these countries (although you will find plenty of west-collaborating bourgoise in these countries as well, who are positioned to benefit from western imperialism).\u00a0\n\n\nThroughout this whole discussion, I have scarcely seen western leftists give any weight to what the workers in the exploited countries want. Well as an indian worker with extensive family in india, I would much rather free India from being exploited by foreigners before waiting for westerners to finally launch their revolution (which they haven't even after so many decades) and so kindly save us.\u00a0",

Achieving this is a dialectical process which requires a dictatorship of the proletariat in the interim to develop material conditions to the point that a stateless, classless society is possible. For China this was particularly difficult given that the CPC took over when China was a feudal state with virtually zero productive forces.",

In a distorted way: it was and never has been a dictatorship of the proletariat. But since the 80s they have slowly but surely brought capitalism back. Also in a dialectical process, quantity has become quality, and China is now capitalist, not socialist, and is on the path to imperialism, like all powerful capitalist countries tend towards.\n\nThe only way China can now achieve socialism is by having another revolution which will overthrow the charlatans and bureaucrats in the CCP and state machinary. And the capitalists, many of whom are card-carrying CCP members.",

It has also been massively succesful, and China has arguably surpassed the heights of the soviet union at this point. Their development model has pretty much been capitalism with heavy government intervention/ownership of large SOEs. It does have elements of state planning in the state's huge influence over these SOEs. Is this orthodox marxism? No, probably not, but it's also not a given that the only way to develop the economy is a pure state planning model like the Soviet Union's.",
