He said this in the context of showing something that, according to him, most Marxists (including academics) get wrong.\n\nSo is there a disagreement between Marxists regarding this? What are the implications of taking one side or the other in terms of theory?",

Basically, value and price exist in dialectical relation with each other within commodities on the market - there's no one without the other. \n\nIn this idea, price is value considered in circulation, whereas value is price considered in production. Changes to circulation and production respectively change price and value. But there is no value without circulation, so it makes sense to say that theres no value without price. \n\nFor example, if social production time of a commodity is shortened, then its value decreases, and its price decreases as well (all else held to be equal).\n\nWhereas if there is a rising effective demand for that commodity, the price may rise while the value stays the same. But that value doesn't actually come into fruition until the commodity is actually sold, when it is realised.",

Socially we have used various things to express price in the past.\u00a0\n\nThe person is right when he says \"there is no value without price.\"\u00a0\n\nBut by the same logic you could say that there is no \"price without value.\"\u00a0\n\nThe thing is in reality you can't seperate these concepts so neatly.

            "body": "I'm not sure it is absolutely correct to say that there is no value without price because value is concept socially necessary labour time. But there is definitely a fundamental relationship between value and price, and disruptions in the circuit of realisation can then lead to crises of devaluation. \n\nWhat do we mean by this? Well, let's take the example of fictitious capital. A series of debt instruments or derivatives are developed in the finance and credit systems to allow trading, arbitrage and gambling on anticipated future profits. When it becomes clear that those profits will not be realised, for example at the too of the trade-industrial cycle just before a crisis, then these derivatives are dumped in flavour of cash. The knock on the effect leads to a generalised crisis of disinvestment as share prices fall, banks withdraw loans, and plants are closed and workers laid off. The value of commodities falls resulting in deflation as demand falls, or inflation as the value of wages is driven down in relation to goods.\n\nNow, here is the question. If value is socially necessary labour time, and if the average time to produce a commodity remains the same throughout the phases of the crisis described above, then how can crises of devaluation occur in the first place? The answer is that capital is not a static thing but a process, a circuit , that capital is self-expanding value and can add value to itself only through a process of production and realisation, and that any break in the cycle temporarily removes the commodity and or the money investment from the value cycle.\n\nSo in a concrete sense, the statement that there can be no value without price is correct, while in more abstract sense, it is not.",

            "body": "Marxian analysis defines three distinct kinds of value: labour value, use value and exchange value.  If I'm not mixing up my terminology, price is very specifically exchange value when expressed as a quantity of money.  \n\nMoney is, in turn, a commodity that has, by common consensus, been designated for use as an exchange medium.  Ideally, it has no other inherent use value other than exchange, and either a very high labour value, or (for preference where efficiency is concerned, i.e avoiding gross wastage of natural resources, energy and human labour time) low labour value but is nevertheless difficult or hopefully impossible to counterfeit.  At the very least, its labour value must significantly exceed its exhange value in order to disincentivise counterfeiting, if counterfeiting is possible.  In order to prevent inflation (which is, IIUC, actually a manifestation of exploitation and surplus extraction, as is the act of counterfeiting itself) it is backed by something of use value, i.e. its issuance coincides with the creation of an equivalent amount of other useful commodities for which it may be redeemed.  Indeed, I suppose in Marxian terms, one could *define* \"counterfeiting\" as the production of commodity money without corresponding production of non-money commodities of equal exchange value.",

Other economists use this interpretation because It also helps to understand that price is something humans give to things or actions \n\nValue does come with a price: This thought sees value as something that will always get a price assigned and that price is the thing that determines the value, rember the chair of earlier, well for some the value of the chair will be determined by how much you or your dad is willing to sell It or how much someone is willing to give in order to have It, let\u00b4s say It took you 2 months to have the chair but It is really bad(Doesn\u00b4t keep up, breaks easily, bad joints), even if it took a lot of work the price of the chair will be low because It is a bad chair that barely anyone wants so the value that will get will also be low, meanwhile an expert chair builder could make one in 4 days, sell it for a higher price and that could be seen as higher value even if It took less work to make It",

It is constructed when commodities are placed in an exchange relationship, and it is the center of gravity of prices in a competitive economy. Prices are technically different from values, but a commodity's prices tend to hover around its value and to correspond to it in the long run. For a commodity to have a value without having a price would be rather weird because capitalist exchange requires money. Value could only exist without prices in a purely barter economy which couldn't be a capitalist economy.",
