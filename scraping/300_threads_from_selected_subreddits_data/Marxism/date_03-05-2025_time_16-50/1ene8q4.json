    "selftext": "I know \"nanny statism\" is usually a derogatory term used by libertarians where they clump together stupid restrictions on the liberty of working class people with a government that provides basic necessities and doesnt allow capital owners to do whatever they want, but I do believe there is a serious criticism to be made at Western governments that pass laws to protect people from themselves and restrict poor peoples access to things of hedonic value. When I say \"nanny statism\" I'm not on about high corporate taxes or free healthcare or big government in general, I'm referring to specific policies to force healthy/desirable behaviours on people. The best example of this is the war on drugs and most recently the war on alcohol and tobacco. Australia is the prime example of this with huge taxes and restrictions on these things as well as zero interest in anything close to legalising anything remotely recreational. Obviously these measures disproportionally affect rhe poorest who on top of not having any meaning or control to their slaving lives now cannot even afford a beer after a day of working for someone else's profit. \n\nMy question is what have marxist scholars and politicians written about the topic?",

We knew we couldn\u2019t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities,\u201d Ehrlichman said. \u201cWe could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\u201d\n\nEhrlichman\u2019s comment is the first time the war on drugs has been plainly characterized as a political assault designed to help Nixon win, and keep, the White House.\n\nhttps://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2016/03/23/politics/john-ehrlichman-richard-nixon-drug-war-blacks-hippie",

Also, you need a state to enforce the concept of private property. They\u2019re more akin to fascists. They\u2019ve got the very definition of a libertarian wrong, and completely ignore the left-wing origins of the movement. They think Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman are libertarians.\n\nThat alone is enough to undermine their arguments. They don\u2019t even have a fundamental understanding of the philosophy they\u2019re preaching.",
