    "selftext": "I've never read the Communist Manifesto before, but I've been interested for a long time because of discussions and principles that come from Marx. I wanted to read from the source and educate myself further, and when I saw a copy of the manifesto while I was bookshopping, I grabbed it.\n\nI soon realised that most of the book is Gareth Jones' commentary and history of communism, and while it's interesting, it's very dense and doesn't feel like a great introduction. I only read on my work commute, so it's taking me a while to get through and most of the first 4 chapters haven't stuck with me at all.\n\nShould I skip to the end and read the manifesto first, and come back to this when I've developed more of an understanding and historical interest? Or is this a great introduction that just needs patience and commitment?",

Nothing wrong with the preface, but I suspect it's only there to justify the cost of the volume - you can get vanilla versions of the Manifesto for a couple of bucks. The Haymarket edition edited by Phil Gasper is my preferred \"extra stuff\" version despite its stupid format.",

I'm somewhat disappointed because I'll probably finish the manifesto in a day, but if the preface isn't worthwhile then I'll gladly move onto my next read.\n\nI was hoping to find some interesting insights and interpretations, that would make the manifesto more valuable to me as a reader, but so far it seems more like 200 pages of historical context. There's only so much of that I can take in, before I'm not even processing the words anymore.",

One thing especially was proved by the Commune, viz., that \u201cthe working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery, and wield it for its own purposes.\"\n\nYou don't want to become the Guy that extrapolates from the manifesto only and ends up with views completely opposite to Marx's (wink Wink you know who i'm talking about)",

But you realize that definitions change over time and practical use? So dictatorship of the proletariat can mean something different in times of marx and in times of lenin. This is basic marxism. Marx isnt a god and he can be wrong, its always trying to use the methods of marx to apply it to the material conditions youre living. \n\nJust an example. The word Imperialism means something different in times of Rome in comparison of today. Just because the whole economy is completely different. \n\nDont read marx like the bible.",

And then later confirmed it after the paris commune.\nIt shouldnt be changed by someone else and presented as the same thing.\nOtherwise you're just manipulating information/ being dishonest.\nMarx was very concerned with the specific meaning behind words. \n\n>Marx himself never considered to be a marxist\n\nThis doesnt make sense, he was Marx, he is the most Marxist person by definition... Unless you admit that \"Marxism\" doesnt follow Marx.\n\n>Marx isnt a god and he can be wrong\n\nThat is true, however then Comes the question of why you would call yourself a Marxist if you don't follow his instructions",
