            "body": "\"a one stop shop for non-practice\"-- you're already misunderstanding what Hegel was doing. I wouldn't approach Hegel with that assumption in your head because you won't understand him from the start. Hegel in the Phenomenology is discussing the various forms of life that the \"world spirit\" took on: from ancient Greece, to Buddhism and chinese despotism, to medieval Europe, then to the Enlightenment and French revolution to the romantic reaction, etc. it is an attempt to spell out the course of history, the various ways it has unfolded, as reflected in philosophy, the various schools of thought.\n\n What is \"the world spirit\"? It's best understood as something like the essence or main thrust of cultures or world outlooks that were adopted throughout the history of civilization, starting with the first real recorded records of \"history\". So he is trying to explain how these cultures and ways of life are tied up with the philosophies of their times, and he wants to show how the particular viewpoints, their content, necessarily leads to other ways of thinking. He is focusing on the ways of thinking, ideas, because that's what philosophy consists in, and these ideas are concerned with what \"is\", i.e. practice.\n\nSo sense certainty and skepticism, immediacy and mediation, empiricism and rationalism, realism and idealism, spirit and matter, theory and practice, soul and body, essence and form, etc.-- all of these antinomies or contradicting standpoints -- Hegel is trying to explain and overcome in his Phenomenology. The practical or objective and theoretical or subjective are from the start tied together, and give rise to something that overcomes the deficiencies of the totality of all of these one-sided determinations. According to Hegel, this culminated in Kant. But Hegel says he failed, and the neo-kantians of his time failed, and that's where his philosophy of objective absolute idealism comes in. It overcomes these antinomies through \"absolute knowing\" and locates their source in history, in their particular time period.",

Terry Pinkard in both of his books on the Phenomenology argues that Hegel's method is not historical but systematic and logical. Pinkard argues that the \"Phenomenology\" is meant to demonstrate how consciousness necessarily develops through a series of logical stages, which can be understood without reference to historical developments. The lord/bondsman chapter is one of the more misread chapters specifically for this reason. It isn\u2019t that the lord bondsman dialectic actually occurred in history, but it is rather an example of why self consciousness isn\u2019t to be taken on its own and its outcomes. H.S. Harris, also in his two books, comments that a historical reading is an oversimplification of Hegel\u2019s goal. Hyppolite, in \"Genesis and Structure of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit,\" suggests that the work is a phenomenological analysis (not really, the phenomenology of Husserl/Heidegger is intentionally meant to be different from Hegels) of human experience rather than a historical narrative. Even some of the more deviating readers like Pippin hold that the historicity of the Phenomenology should in no way be taken as a call to reduce it to being a historical work. This sort of point will continue in your comment. I will point out why it is wrong on certain sections where you take it to an extreme, but the TL;DR of it is simply that you can\u2019t take Hegel\u2019s phenomenology without taking any of his other work into account (though even with the phenomenology alone, it does still go against sec. 1-7 of the preface. This is somewhat contentious though.)  \n  \n\u201cSo he is trying to explain how these cultures and ways of life are tied up with the philosophies of their times, and he wants to show how the particular viewpoints, their content, necessarily leads to other ways of thinking\u201d\n\nHegel was not doing materialist analysis. To an extent this comment isn\u2019t even that wrong, it is just oversimplifying to an erroneous degree. Hegel does bring up stoicism immediately after the master/slave dialectic, as such it is tempting to think of the stoic philosophy as arriving from slavery, but Hegel\u2019s dialectic doesn\u2019t move in a way which would allow for this. From Stern\u2019s Gudebook to the Phenomenology: \u201cRather, it could be argued that Hegel thinks that with Stoicism, consciousness is taking a new turn, and that the insights needed to make this turn possible are only available once consciousness has been through the master/slave dialectic.\u201d (2013 ed. p. 102) Even still in his more mature Lectures on the History of Philosophy he seems to back up the claim that the stoic philosophy didn\u2019t emerge out of slavery: \u201cThis demand for a universal, even though still unproved principle, is henceforth present to knowledge. What answers to this demand now appears in the world through the inward necessity of mind \u2013 not externally, but as being in conformity with the Notion. This necessity has produced the philosophy of the Stoics, Epicureans, New Academy, and Sceptics, which we have now to consider.\u201d ([https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hp/hparistotle.htm](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/hp/hparistotle.htm))\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe is focusing on the ways of thinking, ideas, because that's what philosophy consists in, and these ideas are concerned with what \"is\u201d\u201d\n\nFrom the section on Ideas in the SoL: \u201cThe Idea itself is not to be taken as an idea of something or other, any more than the notion is to be taken as merely a specific notion.\u201d You might be thinking of Ideas more colloquially than what Hegel means by ideas, but if you truly want to hold Hegels claim that \u201cThe object of philosophy is the Idea\u201d (Sec 6 of the Encyclopedia), you have to play with Hegel\u2019s terms.  \nAlso on the claim that ideas are concerned with what is, Hegel holds that thought isn\u2019t concerned with what \u201cis\u201d. Even if you try thinking pure being you end up at quality, which is the **essence** of being.",

It is for this reason that Marx\u2019 critique of Hegel in the Philosophy of Right as well as his and Engels\u2019 other critiques in The Holy Family are invaluable for a truly emancipatory understanding of Hegel. When I claim the Phenomenology is a one-stop-shop this is exactly what I mean. Hegel systematized and brought up the entirety of philosophy in this one Book, with the caveat that if we follow Hegel\u2019s footsteps we end up with a radical acceptance of the status quo.  \n  \n\u201cBut Hegel says he failed, and the neo-kantians of his time failed, and that's where his philosophy of objective absolute idealism comes in. It overcomes these antinomies through \"absolute knowing\" and locates their source in history, in their particular time period.\u201d  \nKant failed on two accounts according to Hegel:\n\n1. Kant\u2019s antinomies weren\u2019t overcome because of his methodology\n\n2. Kant\u2019s methodology only allowed him to come up with 4 antinomies.\n\nFrom sec. 45 in the EL: \u201cBut the more important the issue thus raised the more trivial was the solution. Its only motive was an excess of tenderness for the things of the world. The blemish of contradiction, it seems, could not be allowed to mar the essence of the world; but there could be no objection to attach it to the thinking Reason, to the essence of mind.\u201d  \n\u201cIt may also be noted that his failure to make a more thorough study of Antinomy was one of the reasons why Kant enumerated only **four** Antinomies. These four attracted his notice, because, as may be seen in his discussion of the so-called Paralogisms of Reason, he assumed the list of the categories as a basis of his argument. Employing what has subsequently become a favorite fashion, he simply put the object under a rubric otherwise ready to hand, instead of deducing its characteristics from its notion\u201d  \n  \n\n\nNone of these issues with the antinomies had to do with history, nor does their solution lie in history.  \n  \nA quick note on Absolute Knowledge, the sentiment that it resolves the antinomies through history is not inherently wrong (per it being AK it is hard for anything to be entirely wrong), but I don\u2019t think that that is the goal of AK.\n\nHegel describes the task of absolute knowledge to be the overcoming of certain deficiencies of absolute religion. In Hegelological terms this is the problem of the immediacy of essence \"The world is indeed in itself reconciled with the essence; and it is indeed known of that essence that it no longer cognizes the object as self-alienated, but cognizes it as the same as itself in its love. However, for self-consciousness, this immediate present does not yet have spiritual shape\" sec. 787\n\nHow can the world be reconciled with essence if it can only be grasped after being has been negated?\n\nIn the next passage Hegel writes that moving beyond religion will require \u201csublating \\[aufheben\\] the form of objectivity\u201d or the \u201covercoming \\[ueberwimdung\\] of the object of consciousness\u201d. The form of objectivity is none other than the objectivity developed in chapters 1-3, and Hegel sets out to overcome it by recapitulating how the same structure is reproduced in a practical mode, as and for self-consciousness, in chapters 5 and 6, to show that the idea has been overcome both in reason and in spirit for the subject. You are correct in stating that this is the convergence of practical and speculative philosophy, though this convergence lies not with history, but rather with theology through consciousness and its deficiencies.\n\nThe big point here (and why the chapter on the master and the slave is so important), is that this overcoming is the appearance of the divine in the world, that is, that we move away from the divine as the religious community but into the knowing that the divine is always already in the world. it is taking the divine away from the simply ethical and making it into that which is both ethical and actual.\n\nTheres a great essay in the Oxford Handbook which delves into the origins and importance of AK in the Phenomenology which I recommend you read if you are interested: [https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/28104/chapter-abstract/212220999?redirectedFrom=fulltext&itm\\_content=Oxford\\_Academic\\_Books\\_0&itm\\_campaign=Oxford\\_Academic\\_Books&itm\\_source=trendmd-widget&itm\\_medium=sidebar](https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/28104/chapter-abstract/212220999?redirectedFrom=fulltext&itm_content=Oxford_Academic_Books_0&itm_campaign=Oxford_Academic_Books&itm_source=trendmd-widget&itm_medium=sidebar)",

The systematic and logical aspect is definitely a lot clearer in the shorter and greater logic.\n\n I suppose some of what I emphasized would be found more in the lectures of the philosophy of history and the lectures on the history of philosophy, as well as the Philosophy of Right than in the Phenomenology or the Science of Logic. \n\nBut yeah, I was trying to keep it simple. And my general point stands: Hegel never conceived of philosophy as having nothing to do with \"practice\" or having a practical effect on the world. And if you start with the assumption that idealism just consists in non-action or only pure theory, then you wont understand anything about it or be able to learn anything from it. You have to drop these assumptions going into it because they will be a barrier to learning. Lenin in his conspectus on Hegel even remarks that he found, to paraphrase, Hegel to be more materialistic than the vulgar materialists of his day. \n\nI suspect part of that was because of the way Hegel had been portrayed by social democracy and some followers of Marx as this stupid misleading picture: \"idealists think ideas create the world, materialists think ideas come from the material world.\" This was in part already an oversimplification of Feuerbach-- who by the way I also think every Marxist should read. The Lectures on the Essence of religion are essential for understanding Marx's criticism of Feuerbach, and also just excellent for the breadth of wisdom contained in them. \n\nWhat Hegel thought was a lot more complicated than \"our thinking creates material reality.\" It's true, he thought something about the way our concepts, categories, ideologies, religious and moral thoughts and ideas shape the way we interpret things, but it wasn't this strawman caricature.",
