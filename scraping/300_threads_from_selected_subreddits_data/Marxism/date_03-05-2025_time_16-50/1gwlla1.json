    "selftext": "I have been thinking about that lately. There are two classes in the whole world, and basically, the proletariat cannot win against capital with guns since they don\u2019t have the capital to buy guns. So there is one way: capitalist ideas should be philosophically changed, persuaded into communism. Assume this cannot happen.\n\nThe war between proletarians and capitalists only harms the proletarians. How? Capitalists have the capital, so they have the power to buy guns, and not all proletarians are willing to volunteer in that war. So capitalists basically have proletarian soldiers. When the war happens, it will continuously harm the proletarians.\n\nIf we scale this down to a country, not the world, there are two ways: 1) Capitalists should be persuaded. 2) We need to receive help from other countries. Since the other countries won\u2019t help, and if they do help, they would only help for their own cause, probably leading to imperialism again.\n\n",

Second, your entire argument is shown to be completely false by the practice of proletarian Revolution in the 20th century. The only times in history where the proletariat was able to establish its dictatorship were by the use of the gun. There is no persuading the bourgeoisie to abandon their class interests. It\u2019s ridiculous to even suggest it.",

            "body": "That's a fairly reductionist view but there is some truth to that. It is true that by having control over the means of production, the capitalist class has a big advantage in stamping out revolution. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that the proletariat are the actual producers of goods and commodity, not the capitalists themselves. The workers are the ones who make the guns, not the machines sitting in factories. Even if they automate all of it, someone will have to use them against the proletariats. Even if they build robots to do man the guns, the workers are numerous and without them, the capitalists will run out over time.\n\nOf course, one would say \"The capitalists will just bribe proletariats to stay on their side\". That is also true, the more well off proletariat might continue supporting the system that enslaves them just to survive. This had been the major factor that has led to many failed revolutions.\n\nBut with capitalist greed growing to unsustainable levels and growth becoming impossible to continue due to ecological catastrophe, there just won't be many well off proletariats. All that's left are the poor, desperate and angry workers who are set on breaking it all down.",

But isn't this starting an endless cycle? Forgive me if im scrutinizing too much. \n\nWorkers can protest not making the products but if they dont do that, they would be hungry-poor. But that is also the end of capitalism if there were no worker class, then capitalists wont find anyone to sell their product which they can no longer produce.",

                            "body": "That's a very good point you made, one that many recognize as a reason why the proletariat cant just engage through protests and strikes but rather, engage in all out revolution, which involves seizing the means of production. \n\nBasically, when the revolution happens, the proletariats will actively seize the means of productions, factories, workplaces, resource extraction sites, etc. By doing so, the proletariat can sustain itself and keep itself going. This is essentially what happened in Russia and China, with communists seizing land and manufacturing equipment previously controlled by capitalists. \n\nOf course, this means the revolution had to happen on a mass scale, with everyone organized under a collective leadership that can coordinate seizures. If the revolution is contained, it'll have to specifically pick out the most strategic facilities that best serve their purposes. Or, if it is widespread, like in Russia, everything will be seized as fast as possible.\n\nAnd it's also important to note that the revolution is most likely going to involve violence. Capitalists won't just hand over the means of production which is why proletariats have to forcefully seize them. Ideally, it wouldn't be too violent, only enough to achieve control. But realistically....let's just say the Bolsheviks and CPC had to do a lot of fighting.",

When opportunity equality (well, back in the days there wasn\u2019t any opportunity at all) collapses and the proletariat is barely able to feed themselves, philosophy itself is reborn. Like Marx, during a time when there was huge inequality and violence against the working class, child workers, etc., it created a philosophy through Marx. Probably most of the working class were already thinking that in their minds, at least, but Marx brought that philosophy into order.\n\nAnd where am I going with this? I believe that if a communist utopia is to be achieved, it must be implemented across the whole world (because it will just help the imperialists if the country is not powerful enough), and it will reach that point more quickly through philosophy. If the common people do not understand why they are doing this, then the revolution won\u2019t be real at all, and it will bring emptiness.\n\nWe are also assuming that the revolutionaries have settled everything in terms of philosophy (which includes the technical aspects, by the way). If they have not, then capitalism will rise even more powerful. And again, capitalism itself is inherently problematic. One day, it will collapse.",

The proletariat cant just be wrecking stuff due to anger and disillusionment, but rather, be politically, economically and philosophically educated masses that are aware of the complexities inherent in the struggle.\n\nHowever, it is inevitable that the revolution will happen with a lot of laymen support. They're not exactly Marxists but still supportive of socialist policies on the material basis alone. And yes, this can corrode the revolution and eventually lead to reactionary infiltration.\n\nThat element is also why Lenin figured out vanguardism where Marxist intellectuals and leaders will guide the revolution whilst actively imparting as much knowledge to the masses with the sole goal of  cementing class consciousness (basically make them understand the program).\n\nAs for global revolution, it is sometimes argued that no true revolution can come into existence if it is done locally and not at the global level. Evidently, a communist nation will always be under siege from global reactionaries. This is the reason why Trotsky was such a big advocate for global revolution as he thought no socialist movement can survive when it is limited.",
