Any suggestions or advice?",

Carpet cleaners, WiFi hotspots, power washers, other tools, you name it. I do think a mutual aid system would be hugely beneficial tho.",

There is also a drop off point for people to leave sleeping bags and tents and anyone who is homeless can pick one up. The city we are in is experiencing a huge homelessness crisis. But also I'm not sure where you are but if you can internally campaign for a social worker at the library that makes a huge difference.",

That sort of thing is a bit out of my reach (I\u2019m only a library assistant) but I can see if any coworkers have contacts. Love the idea of tents and sleeping bags though, I\u2019ll need to think of a way to propose that to my boss",

Naturally makes sense bc a lot of homeless folks turn to the library for a safe space to spend time. also providing GED support, helping ppl set up phones, insurance, benefits, etc.",
