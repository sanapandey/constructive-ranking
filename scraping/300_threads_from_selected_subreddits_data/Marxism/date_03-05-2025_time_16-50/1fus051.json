I continued through Michael Parenti\u2019s Inventing Reality, and I\u2019m now reading through Jakarta Method. I want to read more into Marxism in order to better understand it and better support my stance on marxism in discourse with my peers. Please help me start my journey into Marxism. ",

Must shorter and easier to understand than capital. So you should probably read this first\n\nState and Revolution by Lenin, it give you a great introduction to the Marxist understanding of the state and it's relation to revolution \n\nImperialism the Highest stage of Capitalism by Lenin, will give you a theoretical understanding of imperialism and it's relation to capitalism, cooperations, and Monopoly. \n\nThis should give you a good foundation for understanding Marxism. Though you will find you will never stop finding more things to read.",

Like reading Marx without understanding Hegel is pointless.\n\nI always recommend Kolakowski's \"Main Currents of Marxism\". If someone wants to study Marx they should have at least read something like vol. I. While barely one of us agrees with the author's interpretation of later Marxist thinkers vol. I is still a good handbook.",

            "body": "Something I like to mention is that Marxism is scientific. Marxism is first and foremost an analysis of capital(ism) in large part because capital existed in Marx's time to scientifically analyze. Everything else is an extension from that. Don't cling too heavily about what Marx and Engels (and even Lenin to an extent) said about what socialism/communism could/should/would be because it didn't exist for them to analyze. That doesn't mean those analyses are valueless, but still. \n\nI see too many people (especially online) claim things like \"they didn't do socialism right\" or \"that wasn't even socialism\" because it doesn't match the written word of dead old white men. It's the equivalent of rejecting data in favor of the hypothesis.\n\nWe understand where we are and how we got here so we can work towards the next step. We do not look at where we want to be and work backwards from there. To me, that's the difference between scientific and utopian socialism.",

Marx and Engels *did* see socialist revolutions in their own lifetimes, they spent a great deal of effort explaining the failures of these movements and directing the workers' movement in such a way as to avoid those pitfalls. \n\nThe vast majority of socialist organisations in the world, throughout history but especially today, are shamelessly revisionist. This certainly includes the representatives of so-called \"real socialism\". Why do you deny this? Do you think that the failure of real socialism (and it certainly was exactly that: a *failure*) means that the prospects of proletarian revolution have been destroyed for good? The fact that you have to redefine the word \"communism\" to match the existing state of things says less about the regimes you describe and more about your lack of faith in the true, intransigent facts and demands of the communist movement. Rest assured, the socialist parties today have as much to do with socialism as the so-called \"national socialists\" (or, more to the point, the \"social democrats\"). Your \"scientific\" socialism is nothing more than a *rejection of socialism*.",

After that, you should be ready for the 3 volumes of Capital. \n\nIf you're having trouble, Michael Heinrich's *An Introduction to the Three Volumes of Marx's Capital* is solid for beginners. \n\nIf you're interested more on the specifics of modern day capitalism and things more directly relevant to you, I suggest *Hinterland* by Phil A Neel, *The Next Shift* by Gabriel Winant, and *Endnotes Vol 2-3*.",

Presented in a \"matter of fact\" manner with little commentary.\n\nThe biggest issue I believe most Marxists would have with these episodes, because I took issue with it too, is some of the only commentary Mike makes near the end of 10.3 about Marx's theory of value being \"part wrong\". So if you do listen to it, know that everything he says about the theory of value after \"So, is any of this true?\" Should be ignored. He doesn't even offer a real explanation why so it's of no loss to ignore.",

Lenin was at least well intentioned, imo, but he also genuinely believed that the proletariat is too incompetent to achieve socialism without a benevolent autocracy (a transitional government) to guide them to it. Stalin and Mao were just fascists misusing the name of communism to gaslight the workers into subservience under the pretense of a \"greater cause\". \n\nReading their works is fine, of course. Form your own opinions. Just be careful not to believe everything you read, because a persuasive and intelligent author is, well, very persuasive. And although Marx himself was an important figure in the development and rise of Communism, many would argue that his ideas are antiquated or even fundamentally flawed. \n\n\\[Disclaimer: I'm a democratic socialist and this comment is a psyop to deconvert tankies\\]",
