It frustrates me that they recognize something is wrong with the world, that the current state of affairs weighs on them, yet they remain passive until the problem directly affects them. This widespread conformity, extreme individualism, and alienation infuriate me. I get it \u2013 we live in capitalism, and capitalism rewards precisely these attitudes. Just as feudalism shaped the mentality of peasants on communal land, and primitive communities had their own logic of coexistence. Material conditions shape consciousness. But even when you point it out to them, you hit a wall of indifference. \n\nI feel burnt out. I have been active in the union movement and in a local section of an international communist organization for a few years now. The growth in the number of comrades is small compared to the huge sections in other countries. Do you have any methods for such burnout?",

Revolutionary uprising and change can/would introduce supply disruptions, has the potential to initially introduce food scarcity, and brings with it the risk of death, imprisonment, and/or permanent disability of self or family.

The reality is that they\u2019re not feeling true mortal peril, they do not need to risk their lives to battle persons of colour, they have a government to do that for them. The threat that\u2019s sold to them is a justification that the fastest route to alleviating the perceived threat is by letting the government do its thing. It is easy because it lacks a dead if you don\u2019t urgency. You just need to trust your messianic leader. Whereas a socialist revolution means that you must go up against all state forces bearing down on your mercilessly, which most people have to reach utter desperation to achieve. As such you must reach a level where only you and your community can save you. The levels of risk are fundamentally different stages. Sadly, until the corpses of the famine stricken and the diseased pile up on the streets, the saviour theme of populism will ultimately be more palatable to masses who are presently allergic to class consciousness.\n\nAs for the Americans, I find it hilarious how so many are finally just realizing that their democrats are right wing with more interests in common with fascists than working class people.

On the contrary, society actually takes the institutions which hang upon it as given once for all. For decades the oppositional criticism is nothing more than a safety valve for mass dissatisfaction, a condition of the stability of the social structure. Such in principle, for example, was the significance acquired by the social-democratic criticism. Entirely exceptional conditions, independent of the will of persons and parties, are necessary in order to tear off from discontent the fetters of conservatism, and bring the masses to insurrection.\n\n>The swift changes of mass views and moods in an epoch of revolution thus derive, not from the flexibility and mobility of man\u2019s mind, but just the opposite, from its deep conservatism. The chronic lag of ideas and relations behind new objective conditions, right up to the moment when the latter crash over people in the form of a catastrophe, is what creates in a period of revolution that leaping movement of ideas and passions which seems to the police mind a mere result of the activities of \u201cdemagogues.\u201d  \n[The History of the Russian Revolution (1.

Marxism is historical-materialist for a reason.   As Marx said in 1852\n\n>Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. **The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living.** And just as they seem to be occupied with revolutionizing themselves and things, creating something that did not exist before, precisely in such epochs of revolutionary crisis they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service, borrowing from them names, battle slogans, and costumes in order to present this new scene in world history in time-honored disguise and borrowed language.\u00a0  \n[18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (Marx, 1852)](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch01.htm)\n\n/1",

Even people who would be receptive to engaging in some level of risk might still avoid doing so if they don't feel like that risk will pay off. It's a lot harder of a proposition to ask someone to engage in revolutionary action when there isn't an organized vanguard party that actually displays capability to make change currently. It's essentially asking for massive risk with seemingly no perceived reward",

When the first World War broke out, Lenin briefly retreated to the Zurich library and read Hegel's Logic. This had an important effect on him and contributed to his major works. Perhaps you can find someone to learn with together. Then in a few months, return to praxis. Theres nothing wrong with taking a break. The best communist leaders did so, sometimes at key moments in the class struggle.",

If times are peaceful people are inclined to not get super invested in politics.

A lot of the orgs just wanted to recruit college students and protest. There was very little connection to working class life in those orgs. \n\nAny org that isn't interested in building a real socialist movement isn't worth the time. Sectarianism will be the death of the American left. Could you imagine Big Bill Heywood, Eugene Debs, or William Z Foster placing all their eggs into the college campus basket? I can't--because we'd not even remember them if they did. \n\nIn short, focus on the work that pays off, where your class consciousness pays off. Until the orgs start self-criticizing themselves and examine both defeats and past victories, it's best just to stere clear and focus on the real work.",
