But as I\u2019m reading through the introduction written by Robin DG Kelley And Jesse Benjamin (two academics who I am unfamiliar) it seems like they are not really Marxists in any sense. They make small jabs at Lenin and Stalin, while constantly making derisive comments on \u201cStalinism\u201d and the Soviet Union post revolution.\n\nThe intro does help to provide some historical context so it\u2019s not completely useless, but do you all usually skip these types of intros or just power through them?",

They\u2019re probably not adding anything beyond what you\u2019d see on any media outlet.\n\nI have an edition of Hume\u2019s Treatise of Human Nature by a Christian University Press and in the intro they tell you how Hume was so wrong it\u2019s silly. Don\u2019t love Hume, who was a foundational mechanistic materialist (ie, not dialectical), but there\u2019s value in reading him and the critique was so audacious and oversold.",

Similar things occur to Antonio Gramsci, Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, and so forth.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Robin D.G. Kelley comes out of a tradition of critique of Marxism known as the Black Radical Tradition. Their watershed work is *Black Marxism* by Cedric Robinson, who was Kelley\u2019s mentor. They style themselves as dialectical critics of Marx. If you're interested in going deeper down the rabbit-hole of Africanist literature, you should definitely pick that work up.",
