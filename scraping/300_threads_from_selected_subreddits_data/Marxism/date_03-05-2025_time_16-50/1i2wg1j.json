Those are the kind of guys who would NEVER EVER in their lives even dare to talk to most of the cubans or most of the venezolanos, who actually live there.\n\nNothing more than cowards. Go on, talk to the venezuelans or the cubans. Go on. Have at least the decency to talk to the people. You call yourself leftists, but you would NEVER EVER listen to most of the working class in those countries.\n\nPathetic ticks. That is what they are. You are the worst kind of leftists.\n\nAnd if you dont know, because you are naive, go ahead and talk to people from those countries.\n\nwritten by a leftist\n\n",

We saran wrapped it and checked  it on the plane just like any other of the stuff we were taking. Give me a break\n\nYou can also through Cuba max in Miami buy a wheelchair and they will ship it for you directly to Cuba for $350  including the shipping you lying sack of tankie shit",

Last June when the Cuban regime finally allowed us to start shipping gas generators my coworkers and I sent 5 giant generators to our families in Cuba and we sent that through Cuba max. The U.S. never blocked those either, the Cuban regime did though until they finally realized that our people needed them.\n\nEdit: here\u2019s an add from Cuba max shipping wheelchairs, I don\u2019t know if it will open but their Facebook page has it \nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/v/1FnkZCQHQ7/?mibextid=wwXIfr",
