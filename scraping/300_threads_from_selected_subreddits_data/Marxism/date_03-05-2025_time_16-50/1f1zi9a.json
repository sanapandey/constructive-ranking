    "selftext": "It seems quite evident to me that, in the modern capitalist mode of production, musicians are petite bourgeois. Selling their music to labels for distribution, and profiting off of, usually, self organized stage shows, meaning, by default, they are incentivized to hold petite-bourgeois class consciousness. Large musicians, popular musicians, are even bourgeois, having so much capital, music production becomes more of a hobby.\n\nThough, there are/were \"leftist\" bougeois musicians that come to mind. Roger Waters, John Lennon.... those are the only two off the top of my mind that I can think have ever held any Marxist position. Lennon, having been a vulgar Maoist, but could never bring himself to actually read and educate himself on it, it seems. Rogers, being a vulgar anti-imperialist, who can never bring himself to actually read and educate himself on it. There are many more vulgar leftist musicians than educated ones. \n\nWhat, I wanted to ask more specifically about, is the subtext of music. What we're supposed to gather from it, that isn't explicitly stated, but is still there. One of my favorite genres of music is Progressive Rock, which, since its conception, has been derided as \"elitist\", and \"self-indulgent\" by liberals. I don't quite understand the first claim, because, classical jazz musicians doing the same thing is not \"\"\"elitist\"\"\", but they are. \"Self-indulgent\" theatrical live-shows are also somehow an issue. As if, you're only supposed to go on stage and play a guitar and then leave, and can never do anything more or anything less.\n\nThe ideas and messaging of classical music are reactionary. Its hard to square the circle of promoting \"neo-classical\" music, as, it seems to, rather than innovate, perpetuate motifs from the feudal era, about Lords, God, and The Pope. But, does taking classical conceptions of music, and mixing it into modern music, as was done with progressive rock, blunt that edge? Does, this allow progress to be made on both rock, and classical, to make something which, is less reactionary, with any politically-progressive potential.\n\nWhat should the contents of music which is Marxist at its core sound like? Does it sound complex, forming a new genre for socialism, or is it simple, anything anyone can pick up and play? \n\nJust curious what you guys have to say.",

Without the profit incentive is when we'll see what revolutionary music truly sounds like. Also the state should not have a say in the production of art, its only job should be providing funding. I have no desire to repeat the soviet era during which only art that was deemed to pass through the censorship filters would receive funding or be allowed to be distributed en masse.\n\nThat said, Pink Floyd was part of my radicalisation process, as were Rage Against the Machine. So it depends on how cynical you are. If you condemn these bands for not living by what they preach and see no authenticity in their music, then by that standard there is no revolutionary music under capitalism. \n\nI think revolutionary messaging can benefit from capitalist realism in this case. Since capitalism will try to sell even anti-capitalism as a product, we can use the system to spread radical messaging and try and get more people on board.",

It\u2019s a situation where we have to get there first and see. \n\nSoviet art is very interesting, indeed. It\u2019s probably the closest approximation we have to what it\u2019s like to see artistic expression in a realm that totally controlled by the state apparatus, forced to express (according the party apparatus) the class consciousness of the proletariat.\n\nI don\u2019t if I necessarily agree with censorship of art.

And to clarify, bigots and rightwingers are not revolutionary. Conservatism aka fascism is counter-revolutionary and always will be. And the US and many countries around the world have seen revolutionary music. Many workers' songs are either socialist or anarchist and the punk genre has always been at least mildly revolutionary. Rock music used to be revolutionary before it was co-opted in the 80s.",

            "body": "I think apart from the lyrical content which can be subjected to ideological critiqe, music is purely an aesthetic thing which orthodox Marxism isn't meant or equipped to deal with. I don't see Marxism prescribing a positive (analytical, not normative) prescription of what \"socialist music\" should sound like on a priori grounds, such a thing would sound ludicrous to me.\n\nThat certain genres are associated with certain audiences with certain political tendencies is true, but someone's class position doesn't determine their musical taste. I think how certain forms or tastes of music come to be associated with a certain genre is much more something sociology deals with rather than historical materialism, especially if historical materialism meant to eventually lead to a \"socialist music\". Even though I haven't read shit of him I am reminded of Pierre Bourdieu who borrowed a bunch of Marxist concepts to study cultural stuff but who many Marxists would tear to shreds for how he uses capital as a concept.\n\nI think the best thing Marxism/historical materialism/critical theory can do is to analyse and critique how the mode of production constrains creativity in general, with creativity conceived of as an open-ended and never ending process, rather than describe a certain \"socialist music\". And I'm not talking about lyrical content here. And ideally, everyone should have the means to have the free time and instruments necessary to pick up music of they'd like to. That's the farthest I'd personally go.\n\nPurely looking at musical content, certain genres are related to certain audiences yes. But that's a relationship and not an unchanging aesthetic property.\n\nImagine a world where the bourgeoisie is a neatly and super rigidly defined class, where all the members only listen to Taylor Swift. Does that make anything that is not Taylor Swift socialist? Would hazy fuzzy guitar rocks be socialist? Not in and of itself of course.\n\n>Does it sound complex, forming a new genre for socialism, or is it simple, anything anyone can pick up and play?\n\nMusic can be both and both are artistic ends in their own right I think and they don't have to be contradictory. Music that requires more technical skill is not necessarily more aesthetically pleasing either. It's all subjective taste. When you seek to find out whichever one of the two is socialist, I think you're applying socialism as a combination of a normative and aesthetic judgement, something which frankly just does not make sense to me. And my short answer is that you're overthinking things. Just enjoy the music you like and experiment with music if you can and like. But that's music. Literature is an entirely different story and there is a well established tradition of Marxist literary criticism.\n\nOne big Soviet theoretician who was concerned with what proletarian culture should be was Alexander Bogdanov.

The latest possible time for musicians unions to have formed would have been the 1980s.\n\n If you want to do a critical analysis of the role of music, you need to look at copyright and intellectual property laws, you need to look at how monopolies like ticketmaster and Spotify  operate as neofeudal Lords that charge rent for their platforms and services.

Hip Hop has historically been, and still is/can be associated with black radical politics that run the gamut from black nationalism, pan Africanism, to distinct Marxism. It's historical roots are of a liberatory nature, made by, and for, a colonized people, during and after a period of significant political awakening/change in the black/minority community and many actual revolutionary actions by groups like the Black Panthers and the Black Liberation Army. In its purest form it is distinct from many other forms of music because it doesn't even require instruments, just someone who can beatbox and another who can flow, and when incorporating musical equipment, many of it's originators began their careers on appropriated goods.\n\nThere have been academic lessons, articles, and books over the years not only on hip hops radicalism in its music, but also examining its growth and ultimately it's purposeful, manufactured, push into a capitalist friendly direction in the forms of gangster rap or \"money rap\", and away from more conscious rap or backpack rap that could more clearly recall the black radical movements of the 60's and 70's. Plenty of its origins can still be felt in modern mainstream hip hop, but obviously capitalism gonna capitalism and neuter, whitewash, and commodify the art into producing capital and non-revolutionary ideas. It's still found in less mainstream hip hop though. Look through some of Jared Ball's YouTube videos for more thorough and academic discussions on this if interested (his show IMixWhatILike is on the Black Liberation Media YouTube channel).\n\nSimilar themes can be found throughout Reggae as well, as it's origins were very much influenced by liberatory and pan African politics. Take a look into the biggest reggae artist, and most whitewashed, in the US, Bob Marley and particularly others in his band like Peter Tosh.\n\nAlso many classic soul artists were openly socialist or communist, this a bit before my time though and can be looked up pretty easily.\n\nWithout going on, I'll just list some hip hop artists who I think are relevant:\n\nBoogie Down Productions\n\nKRS One (began as a member of the above group, way less radical these days with his support of NYC mayor Eric Adams)\n\nPublic Enemy \n\nPoor Righteous Teachers\n\nWise Intelligent (a member of the above group as well, and more explicitly socialist)\n\nTupac (though not explicit in his lyrics, his real origins were, and he'll occasionally name drop many well known Black Panthers and express similar ideas)\n\nDead Prez (a duo and some of the best conscious socialist oriented rap)\n\nThe Coup (pretty explicitly Marxist. Boots Riley, from this group, produces left media and also involved in organizing these days. Lyrics from the first bar on their first album called Kill My Landlord is \"presto read the communist manifesto\")\n\nImmortal Technique (quite anti US and anti-imperialist, bit heavy on conspiracies, and can also be found in the streets rallying for Gaza these days)\n\nRebel Diaz\n\nMos Def\n\nTalib Kweli\n\nNo Name (awesome female lyricist becoming more and more radical with time)\n\nSkipp Coon\n\nParis\n\nBlue Scholars\n\nRun the Jewels (probably best known modern group. More generically anti-capitalist, and unfortunately Killer Mike's IRL politics are straight into black capitalism. Good music tho)\n\nThe Roots\n\nBlack Thought (a member of the above group and top 5 MC, less socialist and more black nationalist/liberation though)\n\nI'm sure I'm forgetting some. But hopefully this gives some of the less black radically educated comrades a good start on hip hops roots.",

The issue being, its been completely co-opted.  If someone tells you they like rap and hip-hop, you don't assume they hold any radical politics at all, to the point where im convinced its as a dead end as blues became after the mainstreaming of rock in the 1960s. The vast majority of hip-hop produced today has a petite bourgeois class character and message. This means that, hip-hop is not an ongoing modern continuous revolutionary music genre. Not that it ever was, it was always a musical genre with certain political groups. The issue being, the US just doesn't have a strong Marxist-Leninist tradition, outside of the Black Panther's related groups.",
