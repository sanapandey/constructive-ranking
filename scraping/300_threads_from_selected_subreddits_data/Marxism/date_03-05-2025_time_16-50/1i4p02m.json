You should know that there is a diversity of thought and not a single Marxist position on prostitution, even among Feminist Marxist theorists. \n\nI'd suggest reading \"Revolting Prostitutes: The Fight for Sex Worker Rights by Juno Mac and Molly Smith\" for a good primer on the subject. It's accessible, clear, and probably representative of the majority of opinions of contemporary Marxists. \n\nGenerally speaking though, Marxism isn't particularly interested in condemning sex workers. Instead it is critical of the conditions that create it. Prostitution under capitalism is distinct from the way it existed in societies that predate it. It is a social and economic phenomenon that is made problematic because of the context in which it arises.\n\nMost Marxists don't regard sex workers much differently than an Amazon delivery driver or a gig worker. They are all subject to the same forces of alienation and exploitation.",

But legalization means clearly defining what is and isn't allowable. So for example a sex workers might be required to obtain licenses. Failing to do so might mean legal repercussions under this system.\n\nDecriminalization advocates make the argument that absorbing sex work into the regulatory state would ultimately be harmful because falling outside of the boundaries of what the state deems acceptable would result in criminal punishment and that it should be treated as kind of an informal sector of the economy.",

            "body": "I think it is pretty clear that Engels was opposed to prostitution and certainly the early Soviet Union was too.\n\nIn his influential work The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State, Engels refers to the institutions of group marriage that were legally superseded during the bourgeois period, and makes the acute observation that certain of the benefits to men (and disadvantages to women) that group marriage involved have carried over in an extra-legal manner in bourgeois society. These include prostitution, and of course the rape of domestic servants and slaves. Today, with the benefit of hindsight and a more technologically advanced bourgeois society, we can add to this pornography, live cams and child abuse in the family and institutions.\n\nThe reality of prostitution today is that the overwhelming majority of women girls and boys are forced into it either by gangs or through extreme poverty. The oft-cited but rarely encountered successful autonomous call girl belongs more in the fantasies of French filmmakers than in real life. Maybe only fans is an exception to this, but I will defer to people more familiar with the subject.\n\nPostmarxian and postmodern narratives on prostitution often refer to it as sex work with the observation that it is no different from any other form of wage labour, and with the implication \u2013 sometimes made explicitly \u2013 that objections to it are just a form of bourgeois prudishness. \n\nThis seems to me to be highly inaccurate, as the overwhelming majority of prostitutes working in the advanced countries as well as the less developed countries do not receive a wage and do not have anything approaching a contract of employment even in verbal terms. On the contrary, they are often controlled in what they can and can't do, including the hours, their pay is docked by the pimps or establishment owners, and they are at best contractors with limited safety and at worst bonded labourers or even slaves.\n\nEveryone who has commented that Marxists should not blame the women here is obviously correct. But that does not mean that we endorse prostitution as a system. We want the women to receive full legal protections, to be paid, and to have benefits, but we also want them to be transitioned to socially useful and safe work on trade union rates of pay and with full legal protections. That means we are opposed to the system of prostitution, which is an integral part of the practical hypocrisy of latter-day patriarchy.\n\nNone of this is to say that the prostitute is the only form in which women are systematically sexually oppressed. Engels makes the point that it is only through the socialisation of domestic labour and an end to the bourgeois family that men and women will ultimately be equal. This can only take place in a situation in which the associated producers organise all economic life, and in which men and women combine in sexual relationships, homosexual or heterosexual, without having to mix that up with arrangements for their financial and domestic security. The prostitute, therefore, will only disappear when the wife disappears and above all when the patriarch disappears.",

            "body": "I'm not here to moralize so I'm not gonna compare it to \"rape\" or whatever but most people who are sex workers do it to escape poverty. Even among people from middle class homes who engage in it either through only fans or finding a sugar daddy, most of them have some kind of serious childhood trauma/abuse going on, often sexual. And while all work under capitalism is coercive in some sense, the sexual element of sex work makes it especially exploitative. So it is uniquely gross in those ways. \n\nWhat we should do about it is a different question. Once socialism is established and housing, healthcare, and food is guaranteed for everyone able and willing to work, if people want to do sex work so they can afford a bigger TV or whatever, that might be acceptable.   \n  \nHowever, I would still be against it because A) people will still get traumatized/molested under socialism and those people are the ones more likely to do this. Generally speaking, well-off, well adjusted peolpe don't do SW. B) Sex work, like pornography, is spiritually/socially poisonous. It takes a beautiful thing and turns it into an ugly thing. Even in a socialist economy, the human body turns into a kind of commodity that I don't want to perpetuate. It dehumanizes people and even though they consent to their dehumanization I don't think that's okay, we should think about the greater social impact rather than respecting an individuals right to do something (a liberal idea). C) sex work usually rolls one way, it's men buying the \"services\" of women. I think it instills a kind of reactionary misogyny in the minds of men that women's bodies and sexual services can be purchased like that.",

We want to be able to do our jobs safely (properly screen clients, have our safety protected without risk of legal persecution, have safe access to healthcare, non-exploitative working conditions) without government regulation such as registries that leave our information publicly accessible (such as adult dancing license registries in some cities). Decriminalization. Anyone\u2019s personal feelings about sex shouldn\u2019t impact our labor rights, just as someone\u2019s personal feelings about abortion shouldn\u2019t impact healthcare access.\n\n\u2014\n\nETA: I\u2019m putting my edit that I added in my final comment to summarize what my end of this whole back & forth has been, to save anyone from having to read like 12 nested comments. As with any other branch of labor organizing and any beliefs about what labor conditions should be under any economic circumstance, you have to actually be familiar with what the industry in question is like before you are able to speak on it with integrity. \n\nMy point has been this whole time: *You are not qualified to have strong opinions about the working conditions or what is considered labor exploitation in an industry you don\u2019t know the first thing about.* You are not a worker in this industry, so why are you trying to make decisions for us? Framing it as a half-baked Marxist analysis doesn\u2019t change that you don\u2019t understand present working conditions of our industry, so you are incapable of understanding what changes would need to be made to improve or change those working conditions under *any* economic framework. I\u2019m not coming in here talking about how I have strong opinions about what would reduce worker exploitation in the SCUBA instructor training industry because *I know nothing about their current labor conditions*, but for some reason, non-sex workers believe that our professions are up for constant debate because of the continued perception that we are \u201cselling our bodies\u201d. **It\u2019s intellectually lazy and disingenuous labor organizing.** This is virtue signaling with extra steps, with the addition that it increases harm in our industry when people who aren\u2019t qualified to make choices about our safety think they are able to.\n\nAs I said at the beginning, we are perfectly capable of speaking for ourselves and determining what is safe working conditions on our own accord. To echo a common sentiment among sex workers, we want labor rights, not rescue.",

Sex trafficking is a significantly smaller industry, but has a much looser definition. Under present SESTA/FOSTA regulations, any information shared between consenting sex workers\u2014 such as blacklist data on clients with abusive histories, to sharing an incall location to see FSSW clients at, to being a safety contact knowing that the person is with a FSSW client\u2014 can be legally considered aiding in human trafficking. Recommending a client to another worker can be considered a trafficking charge. When I was dancing, I worked in cities where I could be hit with a prostitution charge if vice saw I took off my 8\u201d platforms to preform a lapdance for a client.\n\nPolice are also constant perpetrators of violence against sex workers. And then who are we supposed to go to? And then be hit with our own sex work charges after we\u2019ve been assaulted. This holds true for minors who have been trafficked, many are hit with charges despite the evidence of their situations.\n\nThe issue is targeting the industry directly via penalizing industry. By increasing labor rights for consenting adult workers, and allowing us to work safely, there\u2019s less risk in participating in the industry both as a client and as a worker. This in turn allows for more protection for minors that have been trafficked, because it removes their risk of being unfairly penalized by a vindictive legal system.

This is why I think it needs regional definitions. If I am sharing a working space with another worker and we sometimes refer clients to each other, is that considered profiteering off of another\u2019s labor? If someone is working in outdoor conditions, such as truck stop, and having a friend look out as security considered pimping? These situations can vary between regions. Additionally, sex work has been notable for changing economic conditions in certain regions by bringing more industry to that region\u2014 there\u2019s a lot of interesting data on how sex work shifted conditions in the US west during settler expansion\u2014 so where is the line drawn there? Because of the impact of anti-prostitution laws, the work cultures are too localized for there to be broad definitions without regional context. It needs to be determined up to the workers in their respective spaces.\n\nETA: My point has been this whole time: *You are not qualified to have strong opinions about the working conditions or what is considered labor exploitation in an industry you don\u2019t know the first thing about.* You are not a worker in this industry, so why are you trying to make decisions for us? Framing it as a half-baked Marxist analysis doesn\u2019t change that you don\u2019t understand present working conditions of our industry, so you are incapable of understanding what changes would need to be made to improve or change those working conditions under *any* economic framework. I\u2019m not coming in here talking about how I have strong opinions about what would reduce worker exploitation in the SCUBA instructor training industry because *I know nothing about their current labor conditions*, but for some reason, non-sex workers believe that our professions are up for constant debate because of the continued perception that we are \u201cselling our bodies\u201d. **It\u2019s intellectually lazy and disingenuous labor organizing.** This is virtue signaling with extra steps, with the addition that it increases harm in our industry when people who aren\u2019t qualified to make choices about our safety think they are able to.\n\nAs I said at the beginning, we are perfectly capable of speaking for ourselves and determining what is safe working conditions on our own accord. To echo a common sentiment among sex workers, we want labor rights, not rescue.",

You are correct in that there is no way to criminalize it ethically in a liberal capitalist society like ours (Going off your profile I'm assuming you're from Texas like I am.) And the War on Drugs is a good example of this, but in socialist countries the police work differently in that they are actually able to reduce crime via force. China has its own \"War on Drugs\" and while we might consider it draconian (at least 10 years for even possessing an opiate product) it is effective. It disincentivizes drug traffickers from trafficking in the first place; China's opiate addiction (and overall addiction rate) is much lower than ours and because it disincentivizes traffickers from doing crime in the first place, they don't have all these people in prison like we do. Also there's elements of our government like the CIA that profit off the drug trade but that's another discussion lol.\n\nI view sex work the same way, but obviously the issue must be treated more sensitively. We should not be giving sex workers harsh sentences but the \"Johns\" and of course any pimps/traffickers should face harsh penalties. But my larger point is that when an actual Marxist party is in control, we can re-think approaches that we would normally be skeptical of in the West b/c here the police's chief function is to serve the interests of the oligarchs, they don't really care about reducing crime or whatever.\n\nSo for now we should support the de-stigmatization and decriminalization of sex work, but if we ever get a revolution I think we should re-visit the issue and explore the possibility of cracking down on it.",
