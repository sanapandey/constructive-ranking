This election doesn't really have any immediate effects on me personally ( no family really affected as far as I know).\n\nJust wanted to know if voting for the lesser of two evils is possible position to be in given the fact that, in the short term, it helps protect the rights of some of the marginalised and somewhat improves the working class - increase of the minimum wage to 15 dollars/hr for instance.\n I'm well aware of the Harris campaign's views on gaza and Israel. \n\nI think I ask this question cause I do worry about the conditions there. Even if I was a citizen I'm not buying the \"vote blue no matter what\" idea. I think I'm just conflicted and scared of what a Trump administration could potentially do to people. \n\nI'm pretty green when it comes to theory about things and I can see how this post can feel very lib. So I'd like to be educated and helped out about the position ",

            "body": "It goes without saying but both main parties simply exist to serve the ruling capitalist class so i hate both. To say there are short term benefits to Killer Kop Kamala, i kind of agree but not whole-heartedly. Because for me the Biden administration (and Harris by extension) left me as a trans teenager to rot in the bible belt, which is why i became a Marxist in the first place. \n\nI don\u2019t buy that Kamala gives a shit about marginalized and scapegoated communities. It\u2019s all symbolic, with no material support. She\u2019s occasionally done very backwards things on the topic of trans rights, and Walz was a leading role in the physical resistance of BLM rallies in his state. The entire point of the Democratic line is \u201cVote for us, we aren\u2019t evil like Republicans hahaha just trust us\u201d\n\n(Also to put here. I think we should discuss how Kamala being a Black woman will affect peoples\u2019 views of hers, but from a dialectical standpoint we should address the contradiction of her being a Black woman and being the head of a racist, war-loving, abysmally evil imperialist country that *STILL HAS MODERN SLAVERY IN OUR PRISON SYSTEMS*. Many will think Kamala is wonderful and an icon for women of color across the country. But this doesn\u2019t mean there will be any material improvements for women or people of color under her presidency *because* she\u2019s a Black woman, if that makes sense. Because she first of all stands for the interest of capitalists and imperialism, not for actual social justice that could help people that are socially marginalized like her or are systemically oppressed.)\n\n\nI obviously see Trump as a threat but my view of him has been distorted by internet arguments. I think Project 2025 is obviously crazy, but so much of Project 2025 is *already happening* or *has roots that make it possible, regardless of who\u2019s in power*. Trump just seems to be your average pathetically charismatic bible thumping conservative, who is definitely a threat but not a unique one. \n\nI\u2019ve mostly stuck by the thought like of, \u201cwell, regardless who wins, true liberation won\u2019t *actually* be happening unless we smash the capitalist system\u201d but there are no means to do that in the way it should be done. Simply, we live in a society lol. \n\nI feel sick at the thought of voting for Kamala especially since i participate in campaigns and such about demanding Biden and Harris to be accountable for their war crimes, but at the same time, i\u2019ll give a depressed \u201ci guess Kamala is the best option here, compared to Trump\u201d. I just, fuck whatever. I hate how the dems get away with being so damn evil every time like rats.",

I have contributing to the AFL-CIO labor walks where union members reach out to other union members through canvassing. \n\nLabor needs Kamala and d to win because we have a chance of passing the PRO Act if Dems hold a majority. It\u2019s not a sufficient condition, but a necessary condition. \n\nElections are a great time for us to fight for better conditions and also stand shoulder to shoulder with the working class and build solidarity and connections and agitate. \n\nWe shouldn\u2019t endorse any bourgeois candidates but we should campaign on the basis of issues (like the labor movement does). Which candidate will be better for us on any given issue? And we explain to people that just voting or trusting in politicians is not how we bring about change. We do it through grassroots organizing and direct action. \n\nAs for Trump, he represents a long standing fascist movement which Project 2025 is only a small part of. You should read Democracy in Chains by Nancy Maclean. They want to do away with democracy and the public sector, they want to kill unions. And they have allied with far right Christians and nationalists. This movement needs to be stopped. And the movement that falls within the Dem sphere like labor and other progressive causes needs to be supported. This is also key for winning reform on Palestine.",

Not that that pain would even be remotely real, seeing as Harris and the DNC have no real progressive plan and will destroy us and the planet just as fast as Trump and the RNC will. \n\nAre we willing to sacrifice some of our western individualist selfish values and take one for the global south?

Did Nader acting a spoiler in 2000 make the Democrats adopt the Green Party platform? No. In fact, the Dems and our entire political environment was pulled to the right. Jill Stein again ran in 2016 and contributed to Hillary losing. Did this panic make Dems more aligned with the Green party or the left? No. \n\nSo this idea that if we punish the Democrats, or if we make them lose, they will \"learn their lesson\" and change, is not going to happen. It's a complete misunderstanding of politics.\n\nThe idea that Harris and Trump are the same is just not true. Leftists keep telling themselves this in order to excuse not voting but it's just not true. It's not about the candidates themselves or their personal desires or ambitions, it is about the larger coalitions that make up each party and their voter bases. That is the difference between the parties. The Dem coalition includes capitalists, yes, but it also includes the labor movement, working class progressive orgs, all of whom are actually sympathetic to Palestine. \n\nThere was an officially sanctioned panel on Palestine at the DNC. People who have called for a ceasefire and divestment from Israel like Bernie, AOC, Shawn Fain, all spoke. We have Dem electeds who are on our side like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. \n\nTo say that there is no difference between the two parties is ridiculous. The Republican party base is racists, Christian fascists, and nationalists. No one in the Republican sphere wants justice for Palestinians.\n\nSo if we actually want movement on this issue, we have to empower the movements that the change can come through. And we have to build coalitions with them. The reason Dems can ignore the Palestinian cause right now is that we are standing alone. The protests and marches are good but if we want real change we will have to bring the Palestinian cause to the masses, and doing that requires we build connections with people that we don't agree with. If we build coalitions with labor unions and orgs like the NAACP, which do a lot of work to get Dems elected, they can bring the Palestine cause into their own demands and force Dems to change. If there is enough support within labor then we could also see strikes against weapons to Israel (which is what happened with apartheid South Africa). And we can build these connections with these orgs because we have a lot in common. We want mostly the same things. There is no one on the Republican/conservative side that we can do that with. \n\nThat is where the change comes from. Change does not come from making Kamala feel bad. It doesn't come from shouting slogans at people. It can only come from actually changing the political conditions.",

There is no lesser evil and those who support the arms industry and imperialist expansion are worse and should never be supported. The Marxist position is not to be an accomplice to imperialist action in defense of \"democracy\" but to have solidarity with the workers in demonstrating their strength by organizing independently of the bourgeoisie, even if there is no chance of winning to demonstrate their program to the masses.\n\nLet's take a look at two examples with Marx and Engels that demonstrate the political opportunism you are having to co-opt socialists into supporting the dominance of American finance capital in the world and how Marxists should act in an election of a bourgeois democracy:\n\n\n\n>Complete abstention from political action is impossible. The abstentionist press participates in politics every day. It is only a question of how one does it, and of what politics one engages in. For the rest, to us abstention is impossible. The working-class party functions as a political party in most countries by now, and it is not for us to ruin it by preaching abstention. Living experience, the political oppression of the existing governments compels the workers to occupy themselves with politics whether they like it or not, be it for political or for social goals. To preach abstention to them is to throw them into the embrace of bourgeois politics. The morning after the Paris Commune, which has made proletarian political action an order of the day, abstention is entirely out of the question.\n\n>\n\n>We want the abolition of classes. What is the means of achieving it? The only means is political domination of the proletariat. For all this, now that it is acknowledged by one and all, we are told not to meddle with politics. The abstentionists say they are revolutionaries, even revolutionaries par excellence. Yet revolution is a supreme political act and those who want revolution must also want the means of achieving it, that is, political action, which prepares the ground for revolution and provides the workers with the revolutionary training without which they are sure to become the dupes of the Favres and Pyats the morning after the battle. However, our politics must be working-class politics. The workers' party must never be the tagtail of any bourgeois party; it must be independent and have its goal and its own policy.\n\n>\n\n>The political freedoms, the right of assembly and association, and the freedom of the press \u2014 those are our weapons. Are we to sit back and abstain while somebody tries to rob us of them? It is said that a political act on our part implies that we accept the exiting state of affairs. On the contrary, so long as this state of affairs offers us the means of protesting against it, our use of these means does not signify that we recognise the prevailing order.\n\n>\n\n>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, \"Apropos Of Working-Class Political Action\".\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/09/21.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/09/21.htm)\n\n\n\n>Even where there is no prospect of achieving their election the workers must put up their own candidates to preserve their independence, to gauge their own strength and to bring their revolutionary position and party standpoint to public attention. They must not be led astray by the empty phrases of the democrats, who will maintain that the workers\u2019 candidates will split the democratic party and offer the forces of reaction the chance of victory. All such talk means, in the final analysis, that the proletariat is to be swindled. The progress which the proletarian party will make by operating independently in this way is infinitely more important than the disadvantages resulting from the presence of a few reactionaries in the representative body.\n\n>\n\n>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels , \"Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League\"\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm)",

To avoid doing what\u2019s politically necessary and allow fascists to take power is stupid (and fascist collaboration). We are not talking about \u201ca few reactionaries\u201d winning some parliamentary seats, but a fascist, explicitly anti-democratic movement winning complete control of the levers of power. \n\nIn the US we do not have a labor party but we do have an independent labor movement with its own  independent political apparatus and we don\u2019t have to read Marx to see what they are doing. We should support them in protecting their right to organize and winning pro-worker legislation. Failing to do so is allowing finance capital to gain more power and weakens the working class.\n\nThe argument is not to tail the Democrats or follow them wherever they go because of empty promises or scaremongering.

The United States does not have feudalism, so communist parties should not work with non-proletarian parties of the petty bourgeoisie. However, the Democratic Party is the party of financial capitalism, the greater evil against multipolarism, uniting the world bourgeoisie in preventing the sovereignty of the countries of the global South from nationalizing their companies. However, as in the cases that Marx, Engels and Lenin spoke about other parties, both never tolerate voting for bourgeois parties without exception. The only commitment discussed is to march with other parties to advance the class struggle, but it is never tolerated to grant the leading role in the class struggle to non-proletarian parties to consolidate themselves. Fascism and reactionism are a natural consequence of the decomposition of capitalism. They create complacency with the bourgeois state and the failure to question the institutions of the bourgeoisie feeds false consciousness by opportunists. Therefore, the bourgeoisie must all migrate to Trump and the Republicans to build a real opposition in solidarity with the workers of the world. Any incentive to export arms must be opposed without exception. NATO is an instrument of the imperialism of financial capital against the communist movement and therefore must be abolished to prevent the IMF from indebting other countries to transform them into neocolonies by deregulating and privatizing them into economies that export primary raw materials.\n\n\n\nAnother problem here is that all the institutions of the US Constitution must be questioned so that the population loses faith in them and organizes itself in the revolutionary movement to install the dictatorship of the proletariat instead of clinging to fantasies of bourgeois democracy. Marx and Engels do not value your fantasy of bourgeois democracy at all, all rights are achieved by struggles led by the organized proletariat independent of the bourgeoisie.\n\n\n\nKamala Harris must lose and the Democratic Party must be destroyed so that the workers of the United States lose their chauvinism to a completely anti-war position without exception. The position of this party is completely anti-Marxist co-opting the workers to support the order of global financial capitalism. I would say that anyone who supports the Democratic Party for the 'lesser evil' should be banned for being complicit in supporting the imperialism of financial capital.\n\n\n\nThe party that aligns with what Marx, Engels and Lenin say to vote for in the United States is the \"Party for Socialism and Liberation\" with candidates Claudia De la Cruz and Karina Garcia which can be found here:\n\n[https://votesocialist2024.com](https://votesocialist2024.com)",

The only difference is that you are afraid of the bourgeoisie splitting up worldwide if the Republicans come into conflict with the European bourgeoisie, isolating the United States and destroying the American hegemony that the Democrats represent by supporting the Ukrainian coup plotters and financial capital to deceive the population, repress communists so as not to create a real opposition in solidarity with the workers of the world. When I speak of solidarity with the workers of the world, I mean not interfering with \"threats to democracy\" from other countries that try to nationalize their private companies and repress lackeys of imperialism. The Democrats finance reactionism in the world and in the United States to deceive fools by the lesser evil that does not exist. The Democratic Party supports imperialism more with lies of \"democracy\" with lying apologists like you, therefore the Democrats are the greater evil that must be destroyed without exception. \n\nCommunists do not value bourgeois democracy except as a platform to condemn and abolish it for the dictatorship of the proletariat and so Trump does this work by taking away the complacency of the population so that they organize in the streets without the Democrats confronting the bourgeoisie resulting in more communists and instability to financial capitalism so that the workers of the United States join with the rest of the population of the world in completely opposing it by sabotaging it internally in solidarity with the global south destroying the myth and reputation of the image of the United States that may have some benevolence or capacity to be reformable or be the \"lesser evil\" against the \"authoritarianism of the East\".\n\nAnother mistake of yours is that Lenin considers imperialism always the greater evil without exception and this is non-negotiable, the bourgeoisie will always repress the workers and you pretend that there is an exception to deceive uninformed socialists. The Democrats are the greater evil that must be opposed, but as always, voting for bourgeois parties is forbidden by all Marxists. To oppose reactionaries you must organize independently of the bourgeoisie in revolutionary organizations of the proletariat and not as appendages of the bourgeoisie.\n\nIf you dare to give another answer supporting voting for bourgeois parties, I will include a quote from Lenin's position, which is not to vote for democrats, but rather what the policy of the revolutionary communist party is in relation to other parties and participation in bourgeois democracy to radicalize workers with propaganda. There is no tolerance between Marx, Engels and Lenin for not voting for communist candidates.",

On the other hand it is neoliberalism that fuels the current rise of far-right populism. I think voting for Harris would have some benefit in the short term... but then we will pay for it later. Trump for example is a byproduct of the Obama administration. Obama from Bush. Bush from Clinton. etc It just becomes worse every cycle because the democracy is gone. It has become extortion. People vote to prevent the election of someone instead of electing someone who is qualified to represent the people and not corporate America.  Imagine what the world will be like after 8 years of Harris. Do you really think it will be a better place? So you can vote for one of the socialist candidates, lose, but have peace of mind that you voted for someone who is not backed by capitalism. Or you can vote for capitalism, even the lesser of two evils, but ultimately it is this action that makes both evils worse and capitalism even more impenetrable in the long run.\n\nMy advice would be contact some supporters for the other 4 candidates and ask them why they are not voting for Harris.\n\nFor me it is a no go. This idea that Harris will combat inflation by creating more jobs so Americans can work more hours to be able to afford the cost of living... or will subsidize childcare, so that Americans have the time to work more to be able to afford the cost of living.... doesn't sound like improving working class conditions, more like making us work harder with less time for our families.

They are under no illusions that the Democrats are pro-labor because capitalists have a lot of influence on our politics. So they keep in mind that regardless of the election outcome they need to be organizing and possibly going on strike. However, they recognize that pro-labor legislation only has a chance to pass if Dems win. If Republicans continue to win and Right to Work legislation keeps passing that kills unions. Not to mention how antagonistic to labor Trump\u2019s NLRB was, while Biden\u2019s was very pro-labor and allowed for a boost in union organizing. Just like at the end of every strike workers have to sit down with the boss, in our current system, any reform we want has to go through the Democrats. In the end we have to sit down with them.\n\nSocialists also have to be where the people are. We can\u2019t build a movement without fighting with people to improve their conditions. And part of that always will be engaging in elections. All the progressive working class orgs are trying to defeat Trump and we need to stand with them. \n\nDems can ignore socialists and ignore Palestinian protesters because we are alone. We need to build coalitions. Unions should be able to tell Dems that they need ceasefire on their platform if they are to get their vote. Same with NAACP and other orgs. But to build that unity we have to make the effort to find common cause with them and show solidarity with them. \n\nAnd yes, fascism comes out of liberalism but liberalism itself should be protected. We can\u2019t allow fascism to grow because it is only under liberal democracy that we have the rights to organize politically. And we have been able to fight for many democratic gains which are worth protecting. Fascism kills the communist movement. We\u2019ve seen what happens. Even McCarthyism killed the left and labor in this country. We need to preserve as much democracy as we can to give ourselves the best chance. \n\nBtw, Trump and the MAGA movement is a real danger.

            "body": "I think the thing that not enough people are talking about are the constant shifts in rhetoric coming from Harris and the Dems. They love saying both that the Republicans are scary and dangerous, but also are adopting Republican positions on so many things. The Democrats are open to mass deportation. They're enthusiastic about militarizing the border and slashing immigration numbers. They removed their party platform opposition to the death penalty and torture. The Biden admin has released a memo to the military allowing for the use of deadly force against protestors. Not even mentioning that Harris is constantly talking about having Republicans in her cabinet and in key positions of power. I think that the real political insiders have realized that Trump and Trumpism are a poison to their political prospects. They realize that Trump is killing the long term political aspirations of the party. So they're gearing up to let the Republican party sink. What I mean is this: Kamala is driving the Dems right and the \"moderate\" Republicans are gearing up to jump ship should Trump launch a coup that fails again. I think we're going to see a lot of political violence over the next few months. If Trump succeeds in coming to power (legally or otherwise) his loyalists will be in power and we're fucked. But at the same time, if he launches a coup that fails, so many of the Republicans, the Cheney's and Romney's of the world, are going to say \"see! He's dangerous, but not us, we're good\" and the more moderate elements of the party will fuse with the Democrats, and the Republicans can fizzle out or whatever, it's almost inconsequential because the vast amount of Republican political power can shift easily to this new \"centrist\" conglomeration. So then we'll have the people who gave us hits like the war in Afghanistan and Iraq leading us into war with Iran. I still encourage people to vote, but I'm not telling anyone to vote for Kamala anymore. Vote for the other candidates in your more local elections and ballot measures (ranked choice voting, for example) but at this point a vote for either trump or Kamala is a vote for fascism in the United States. The imperial boomerang is already in flight. The horrors we're seeing in Palestine will come back home when these cop cities are finished, when the military is used to crush rebellions nationwide because we don't have access to water after the next hurricane or whatever it may be. The US Empire's hegemony is coming to an end. And in these last moments of absolute power, when the empire is threatened and endangered, it will lash out and be it's most violent in an attempt to survive. We'll probably see the opening of many new fronts to the various wars. We'll see massive effects from climate change. Tbh, the election for president feels almost unimportant because of how many things are at stake, where both parties have the same stance. Kamala has no climate policy. None! What's the point of it all then? \n\nI also just want to say I'm sorry if this is just a super downer. I feel more depressed after having written it. But like Gramsci said, \"Pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will.\" Change and revolution are hard. But the alternative, the probable extinction of the human species, is harder to swallow. All we can do is build community, work to prepare ourselves and our loved ones for the hard times to come. Take the time before the shit hits the fan to learn as much as you can.

Like saying no one will have to vote after this election, how he will jail political opponents, cutting off the US from the globe via tariffs, etc. Despite how random the truth of his statements tends to be, I tend to think he will jump at any chance to take a fuller control of power, and also doubt he will concede if he loses anyway. So the actual US left is probably in a worse position if he gains power again, at least a more threatened one. Maybe his actions cause the global economy to pull out of the US? But that\u2019s a really complex/unlikely scenario considering the US kind of is the global economy.",

It goes against the strategies devised by the Comintern to fight fascism. \n\nThings getting worse does not lead to socialism. The working class does not spontaneously develop revolutionary consciousness. It is the communist\u2019s job to build it. The worse the conditions are, the harder it is to build any revolutionary movement. People will not suddenly have an epiphany about socialism, they will simply turn to fascism (which is what we\u2019re seeing in real time).\n\nThe only time a crisis in capitalism will turn toward socialist revolution is if we have done the work beforehand. If we have organized and built revolutionary consciousness.\n\nThat\u2019s Russian Social Democrats and other socialists did in Russia under the Czar. They allied with liberals to win the 1905 Revolution. The creation of the duma and the Soviets was crucial in 1917. Without the reforms won under the Czar, the crisis of WW I would not have led to anything. \n\nSo we have to fight for greater political freedoms and democracy. We have to fight to make sure people have their basic needs met. People being housed and fed makes them more likely to read theory and join socialism, not less. The Comintern laid out a strategy to build an anti-monopoly democracy against fascism which would serve as a transition toward socialism. We have to fight for things to get better in order to build a revolutionary movement.",

Most left-wing people have nice and comfy jobs in academia with more things to lose than gain if the current system goes broke. So I know the theory, I just don't agree that it has any relevance today. The more we got the illusion that somehow things will sort themselves up the more the capitalist system actually make everything worse. We are against time, time we do not have. The things will never get better so we can build whatever revolutionary movement. Do you think that the capitalist class actually want you to be better and prepare for the revolution ? Revolution will come if you will have lost what you now fear to lose. As long as people have so much to lose, they are WITH the system, not against it. The problem with the armchair communism is that you just sit and wait and say that 'the conditions are not ripe for socialism yet'. Very helpful.\n\nAs for the organizing and education, I see none of it, anywhere. I don't know in your country, but in mine, the better they make themselves up, the comfiest the life they get, the worse they become as human beings, as people, their consciousness aligns itself with the bourgeois ideology more and more, not less. They do not read about socialism just because they now afford rent in the expensive area in the city, LOL. The relatively well-of of today suffers too much from 'I got mine-ism' to really take your theory seriously. Only recently, when some of these guys got laid off because of IT crisis, they started to agitate for the unions and so. Not before !

UAW and Teamsters had \\*historic\\* strikes where they brought giant corporations to their knees. The longshoremen are about to strike. The railroad workers went on strike. Many new unions formed and Starbucks workers continued to unionize. For the last year people have been on the streets marching for Gaza, marching against war. There have been encampments on campuses across the country. \n\nSo people are not complacent at all. I think you need to go out there and get involved so you realize that everyday people are fighting for better for themselves and their families. \n\nYes, crisis can spur people into action, but often crisis doesn't do anything at all. People simply deal with it. The most active and engaged people are union workers who already have better working conditions and wages than many others. It's the fact that they have an organization and a way to demand better that makes them more engaged, not whether they are living in destitution or not. In fact, them having better conditions and knowing how they won them allows them to demand for more.\n\nIf we are going to get people engaged, we have to build structures for them to do it. We have to agitate them into action. Couple years ago Google software engineers walked out. These are very well paid workers, but they didn't want their work to be used for evil. So it doesn't matter how well off you are, if you have an avenue to demand better, you are more likely to do it. So we have to find a way to reach people with what matters to them and bring them into the movement. \n\nIn France, it is the working class blue collar workers who are turning toward fascism while middle class professionals are joining the socialist parties. And it's not just that these are academics who don't care, the Popular Front was key in defeating fascism in the recent elections. It's a complicated issue but it's not as simple as people turn left as things get worse for them. \n\nThis was one of Marx's insights about capitalism. It digs its own grave because it puts workers in a factory together and creates the conditions for them to organize in large numbers. So what's important to building a socialist movement is that we create and strengthen the institutions that become avenues for change, like labor unions.",

But that's not because their material conditions are so good that they are opposed to change, right? It's a matter of ideology and culture. That's why we need to build these institutions to bring people into the movement for change and also educate and agitate people into demanding better.\n\nSo, one, we have to be strategic about how we go about building our movement. We can't start by trying to appeal to people who are very comfortable and are opposed to change. We have to go to the more oppressed classes. Or we have to take advantage of capitalism's regular and cyclical crises to reach people (like your example of IT workers getting laid off). There are always local day-to-day issues we can organize around. \n\nBut once the movement is established, then the work of getting people engaged becomes a lot easier and wealth and improving conditions become much less of a barrier. Partly because there is a cultural shift (e.g. individual workers who compete with each other for raises vs union workers who believe in worker solidarity and shared wealth) and also because now they are already organized into whatever the goals of the organization are. \n\nThe key to all of this is showing people that we are there to help (what I would call showing leadership), that we stand in solidarity with them, and building relationships. Your best friend is much likelier to do what you ask, and is much likelier to be convinced by you than a stranger.",

As annoying as liberals are, I do believe labor organizing and such will be better under a Harris administration than the alternative acceleration to Fascism, even though again Harris' policies on immigration and israel alone are like carbon copies of the American Republican party. When more billionaires are supporting you than the other candidate, I would be hard-pressed to believe you really represent the common man.\n\nAll in all, you shouldn't expect for voting on a federal level to really make impact in the short-term. Most progress happens as a consequence of mass mobilization on behalf activists and such. Don't expect political leaders to save you, so I hold no idealism on voting as a reflection of myself.\n\nAlso, I vote in a swing state and I would rather not operate under GOP leadership at the state and local level.",

In democracy, the most popular or the richest get elected, not the most caring, or the most capable. Plato and Socrates hate democracy too, as it opens way to demagogue. I've watched a video where Mehdi Hasan boasts of how \"we in the UK is democratic, while you, China is authoritarian; We get to choose our leaders, you do not\". Well, How is Keir Starmer working out for the Brits? Countries are better off using Sortition which is cheaper, and more democratic than elections.  \n2. If you always vote for lesser evil, then evil always wins.  \n3. Political parties should be abolished, as it promotes factionalism and conflict, where there should be cooperation and camaraderie toward a common goal.",
