Civic nationalism is basically having pride in your nation and its citizens without having an ethnocentric or superiority complex (like not promoting the idea that your country is inherently superior to another). It's typically promoted by non-sovereign nations who wish to become a recognised, independent, country. For example, in my country, Scotland, we have a political party called the *Scottish National Party* whose main ideological stance is civic nationalism.",

Nationalists always ignore that in reality the people is a false abstraction-- it's a collective of conflicting and antagonistic interests that only share one main feature: they are ruled over by the same state. \n\nOf course, many nationalists don't think the current government really represents the people because they are dissatisfied with it and often want \"good rule\", new leaders with a different program.\n\nRecommended reading:\n\nhttps://www.ruthlesscriticism.com/nationalismforidiots.htm\n\nhttps://www.ruthlesscriticism.com/nationalism.htm",

Your friend focused more on his country and neighbours, and there's nothing wrong with that (I regret that some of what he said lines up with some if my beliefs). His nationalism seems much more liberal and progressive than the nationalism we are familiar with (i.e. ethnic nationalism), and it could be argued it isn't nationalism at all. Still, your friend wishes to better his country and protect the people in it, and that's important to him.",

            "body": "Historically, nationalism was used in the sense of \"nation building,\" the ideology of nations, of uniting a people behind common features, most typically a common language and history. It was originally a liberal and progressive force against the aristocracy. Often, it was egalitarian.\n\nBut reactionary aristos and the upper bourgeoisie found a way to capture its ideas and twisted it in Europe to become an ideology that reinforced hierarchy. And there it has remained. Because, once the nation is built, there's no real need for nationalism anymore; so it rots into fascism.\n\nPatriotism is the concept of love of one's homeland, from \"patria\",  land of one's fathers. When taken to obsession, it often ends up in the same place as nationalism.",

And there it has remained.\n\nI'm not sure that's entirely true. Nationalism and liberalism were the ideologies of the progressive bourgeoisie, yes. But since the bourgeois revolutions laid the basis for the development of the nation state alongside the capitalist mode of production, nationalism and liberalism went from being an historically progressive force into an historically reactionary force by its own accord of its inner dynamics.\n\nThere was no other group of people who \"captured\" the ideas of nationalism and \"twisted\" it. The reactionary nature of nationalism was there from the beginning by the fact the bourgeois revolutions which came from nationalism didn't abolish class society as a whole and they spread capitalism as a global force, where antagonisms between nations is inherent as each national bourgeoisie fights for their own markets.\n\nEdit: This is of course a textbook example of dielectics in action, of something turning into its opposite. What was progressive in the 1790s was fully reactionary by the 1910s and led to major inter-imperialist conflict. But that \"thing\" was the same thing in both periods. No one captured it and twisted it. It evolved naturally from being progressive to reactionary over the course of its historical development.",

In fact Japan and Germany were the major outliers of the bourgeois revolutions, in that they weren't revolutions at all - at least not by the \"masses entering the stage of history\" definition of revolution - as like you said, it was the old aristocracy which made the change. Both went from feudalism to capitalism by order of the feudal aristocracy themselves. Really quite incredible  when you think of it. But unsurprising. The Japanese feudal nobility had seen what Britain had done to China and perhaps rightly thought they'd suffer a similar fate if they didn't abolish feudalism and become a  capitalist-imperialist power themselves.\n\nEdit: with Japan I'm referring to the Meiji restoration, which funnily enough happened almost at the same time as the unification of Germany by Bismarck.",
