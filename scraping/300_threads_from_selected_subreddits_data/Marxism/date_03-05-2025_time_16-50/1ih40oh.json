    "selftext": "About a year ago I attended an anti-fascist protest with a trotskyist organisation I belonged to at the time. There were about 20 sad little fascists protesting against drag storytime at a local pub and hundreds of leftists turned up. Morale was great, weather was great, people just chanted and whatnot until the fascists went home. \n\nThe police held the lines between the fascists and anti-fascists, with a line of officers facing both of us. I never went to the front of the line as I don't really want to get arrested or dragged into any altercations. A handful of the younger ones in the organisation linked arms and tried charging the police line multiple times for no good reason other than \"the state shouldn't hold the monopoly on violence\". They got themselves recorded by the fascists who promptly posted their videos of \"violent leftists\" on social media making the whole situation even more stupid.\n\nThey talked about the failed charge in the pub and believed they just needed a few more people to \"break the police line\". Yeah and then what? None of it made any sense. There was no violence instigated by the police other than retaliation and the aim was to make the fascists get bored and go home which they did.\n\nWas there any point to this and has anyone been around similar people or in a similar situation? With the talk of some leftist group members being state actors (in the UK) them being state actors baiting people into disparaging the image of the organisation and possibly getting arrested seems like the only way to explain it other than idiocy. \n\nMaybe I'm missing something. I'm not naive to think violence is never the answer or protestors should never ever be violent, it's often necessary. This occasion was one where it felt both unnecessary and counterproductive.\n\nOh and I'm no longer part of that organisation, they were ineffective idiots imo",

            "body": "Short answer:\n\nIt is understandable, if bad praxis, to want to hurt fascists - especially if you're the group they're attacking.\n\nSlightly longer answer:\n\nAt the end of the day it does very little harm to show people that the police are not infalable, and while they may show up to protect fascists - there isn't a guarentee of safety. \n\nThe fact only 20 fascists showed up is not because there are only 20 politically active fascists in your area. There are a lot more people sympathetic to fascy ideology than any of us like to admit. The reason so few show up is because of the threat of violence - either in the moment or once they've outed themselves.\n\n\"Why express violent intention towards a small number of open fascists\" is a bit of a parachute problem - \"why do I need a parachute I'm already falling slowly\". Being openly violent to expressed fascism is a reasonable response.\n\nThe idea that far-right care too much about the presentability of the left is misguided. They'd be just as likely to film people being peaceful and post that we're all \"cucks who sit and take the abuse\".\n\nNone of this is to say that the police charging was particularly effective, nor any real application of Marxism. Fascism wasn't really a thing until after his time, but at the end of the day it's not *really* a class struggle.\n\nTo answer:\n\n>Yeah and then what?\n\nA lot of hand to hand violence, presumably with the smaller party suffering the most damage. Anti fascists are usually pretty on it for beating up Fasc, especially in a group.",

A better short answer would probably have been \"For non-communist reasons\". **Nothing I say below is defensible communism.**\n\nA fascist has a different view of the police than a communist (or even an Anti-fascist). They view the police as funamental, and in the buisness of upholding an ideal order. This idea of an objective right and wrong, with a destined heirarchy that will appear over time, is an important part of the Fascy mindset. The idea that the police can, or should, be challenged is kind of absurd to them (an exception is made when the police aren't 'doing their jobs', fascism is full of quirks).\n\nAll of this to say:\n\nTo demonstrate that the police are not a fundamental part of life, but rather (per S&R) \"*special bodies of armed men*\" and that they can and will be met with violence **even when they're doing their jobs** is a fairly scary idea to the Fascist. If you're not used to the idea that the police always can, and always will, protect you - to learn it's possible that they might not tears down one of your fundamental 'securities'\n\nThe intention was to direct violence at the police to inspire fear in the fascists they were protecting. Had the first line broken this would have been clearer - if they'd broken the second, even more so - but even without it the message \"the police are not sacred to us\" was sent. It seems believable that *had* a few hundred leftists charged at once there may well have been enough to overwhelm the police and the fascists.\n\nPersonally I'm kinda grey at the whole thing. Fascists and their ideology is bad for workers. If I have to listen to *anybody* shout slurs or incite violence against people like me I will be inclined to wallop them and anybody who stand in my way. It's bad praxis, but Marx always made it clear not to forget that humans are humans.\n\nI doubt the police charging did much, I also doubt it caused much harm.",

Let's say we broke the lines and beat up some fascists, yay we won. Then what? More police backup will be called for one. Do we keep fighting or what do we do?

If there was ever a somewhat reasonable use of spontaneous and impulsive force, the catharsis of making fascists and their defenders feel less comfortable is probably it.\n\nLike punching a Nazi is not really moving me or my comrades any closer to abolishing private property, but sometimes there's a Nazi in front of you. I think more mature members of the party won't waste the energy but younger members - or members who are minorities might have that energy to spare.\n\nTbh I think the worst case would have been breaking through entirely, I also don't see that as too likely. Getting close, maybe?\n\nYou can't get rid of fascism by killing all the fascists. That's kind of their way of thinking. You can get them to shut up by making it clear they can get hurt, and a quiet fasc doesn't organise.",

Infiltrations do happen, but they're extremely rare- most likely, it's plain old common idiocy.\n\nAs a rule: if your org is undisciplined enough that they're diving cops for no reason, cops are not wasting their time with it. They know that it will either collapse on it's own or limp along, failing to do anything meaningful. Paranoia around infiltrators, lack of community skills, and a highly mobile society all work together to passively prevent leftist spaces from organizing effectively.

(Why don\u2019t you name them or post their analysis of the confrontation.)\n\nGenuine Trotskyism is concerned above all else with the development of the political and historical consciousness of the working class. \n\nThe absurd idea that a hundred protesters charge a line of police will magically end the monopoly on violence enjoyed by the capitalist state is a symptom of an ultra-left infantile disorder or consistent with the ncritical adulation of the \u201carmed struggle\u201d. \n\nGenuine Trotskyist have always fought against such idealist radicalism. \n\n\u2026 as with the PLO, \u201cthe armed struggle\u201d was identified as, quoting North in \u201cHow the WRP Betrayed Trotksyism,\u201d \u201cthe supra-class strategy of anti-imperialist struggle,\u201d rather than a \u201ctactic \u2026 employed by definite social forces in pursuit of their class interests.\u201d[44] The WRP acted to cover up the fundamentally opposed interests of the bourgeois nationalists and the Zimbabwean working class and peasantry.\n\nAs for the \u201cin so far as\u201d condition for the WRP\u2019s support, this was dropped within a year. In November 1979, the Patriotic Front called off the armed struggle and entered negotiations with the Smith government\u2014the Lancaster House talks\u2014overseen by British imperialism. The WRP spent the duration of these talks in a degrading game of catch\u2014justifying every retreat and sellout authored by Mugabe and Nkomo.\n\nThe result was a Zimbabwean parliament with 20 of 100 seats reserved for the white minority (5 percent of the population) and policies of nationalisation of land with compensation (purely on a voluntary basis for the first 10 years), acceptance of the capitalist base of the economy with seizures of private property and blanket nationalisations foresworn, and peaceable relations with imperialism. Within three years, President Mugabe had slaughtered 20,000 civilians in Nkomo\u2019s home region, presumed supporters of his faction, and forced Nkomo to flee the country.\n\u2026\nhttps://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2023/10/06/sagj-o06.html",

Not with cops though, in this case it's how they deal with hecklers. Constantly flirting with violence and getting in screaming matches and making our movement look stupid and immature.\n\nThey outwardly care about all good stuff, intersectionality, leftist unity, etc, but they end up just causing fights and astroturfing when they show up places. I attribute it to the narcissistic \"leader\" of their org who seems to think it makes some sort of difference to \"fight!!!\" like that. It's pathetic and it's alianating me and my friends from organizing. Frankly, behavior like that puts us all in danger with the new administration's fascistt goons looking for any excuse to ruin our lives... like, please, pick your battles!",
