I'm not really active on this subreddit beyond some lurking, but as a trans (anti-state)marxist who specifically did not vote for kamala last election, I think that I can at least help answer some of those questions you had.\n\nI'm going to answer your questions in reverse order because the question of electoralism really bothers you, and I get it, I used to agree with that perspective. The issue is that democrats (the \"lesser evil\") being in power really does little to actually help me survive, in fact, still with these executive orders happening, it makes it arguably more difficult. Democrats are the \"controlled opposition,\" they act as counter-insurgency against radical actors, and when they are in power, they still kill trans people, they just hide it better. They kill us through incarceration, the maintenance of patriarchy and bourgeois democracy, and through policing. Worst of all, as we're seeing right now, it never mattered, because they refuse to put up a fight because they don't give a shit about trans people. We're kinda fucked whether it's them or Trump in power, because all roads lead to fascism. \n\nI'm going to answer your question about socialism while expanding on what I mean. A lot of marxists have pointed out that Capitalism (since around 1968 give or take a few years) has been in a precarious position. As capitalism develops itself, as a natural, inherent process, it becomes more and more difficult for Capitalism to extract surplus value from workers. Right now, we are at a point where Capitalism is threatened by the fact that it is barely holding on. In the 20th century, fascism emerged as a response to communist uprisings, whether in Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, or Chile. Right now, it is emerging not as a reaction to uprising, but simply because it is collapsing over its own weight. If the democrats were in power, this would still be the case, Kamala would still fund riot cops who would shoot tear gas at radicals, if not more violent measures. Trans people would still be on the chopping block. \n\n  \nSocialism, or Communism, may or may not be possible as an end goal. It all depends on whether we fight for it, and work to create new social relations, unmediated by capitalism. As Rosa Luxemburg said, we are faced with two options, socialism or barbarism. The only way out is through, and even if we don't make it to the self abolition of workers, we can fight for a better, freer world.",

All I can hear is, \"yes, people like you will suffer and potentially die, but that's a sacrifice we're willing to make!\"\n\nI want you to read this very carefully.\n\nIn the previous US election, there were presidential candidates (Jill Stein, Cornel West, etc) whose policies were miles better than that of the candidates of the two major parties.\n\nLet's assume that the assumption that Harris would have won if all leftists voted for her, is true. From this, you conclude that leftists are responsible for all the atrocities Trump admininstration will commit.\n\nBut there is another truth that people like you overlook: if everyone who voted for Harris voted for, say, Jill Stein, then Stein would have won, and not only would Trumpian fascism would have been defeated (at least for the time being), several progressive policies would probably have been passed, many of which would have greatly benefitted people like you.\n\nThen, in this case, you can conclude that anyone who voted for Harris is responsible for all the atrocities Trump admininstration will commit. You can conclude that Harris voters were the ones who ultimately prevented a progressive president from coming into power and implementing progressive policies, and, instead, paved the way for Trumpian fascism to regin supreme.\n\nBut, somehow, people like you always seem to only blame leftists for \"enabling Trump\" and never seem to blame those who refuse to vote for a progressive 3rd party candidate and instead chooses to stick to the Democratic Party to the very end.\n\nLeftists are stubborn and refuse to vote for liberals, but liberals are similarly stubborn and refuse to vote for leftists. The real difference, though, is that leftist policies are better than liberal policies, which I hope you can agree on.\n\nSo why are only leftists uniquely responsible? Why aren't you blaming the stubborn liberals who refuse to vote for progressives who will protect you much better than liberals will?",

Additionally, there is an attitude which in my country is called \"accelerationism\" (as in accelerate decay or crisis), which is the view that it is better for the working class to suffer to make us more motivated and willing to fight. However most Marxists I've met deem such attitudes as vulgar or uniformed Marxism, this is not the best line of action and not coherent with the principle of defending our class. After my country suffered a recent coup supported by the US that ousted a Center-Left government and put a fascist-neoliberal alliance in power, I'm convinced this is the right line of thought. The more fascists have power, the more they infiltrate society and institutions, and leave less possibilities for organizing our class.\n\nI understand that int the US the Left (not only communists) are very dissapointed at the Democrats right now, so maybe there is an emotional factor at play. But mostly Marxists taught me to use every weapon the system throws at you to fight back, so if there is a candidate that is \"less worse\" to communists, they should vote for such candidate (not get hopes up though). So in my country I usually see Marxists having a nuanced vision about this, and they always vote against fascists since fascist forces tend to persecute communists and worsen the life of the working class.\n\nI live in a Third World country, so I don't know how to assess the chances of communists in the USA. It always seems to me the USA has a very closed political landscape, I mean only two major parties in a nation of hundreds of millions citizens... In my country, even though communists were massacred by a US puppet dictatorship in the 60's-80's, there are still relevant Leftist parties and major Leftist mass movements. Communism has been growing a lot here, but then again so has fascism.",

I will add two quotes here and then a third that explains the real position:\n\n>Complete abstention from political action is impossible. The abstentionist press participates in politics every day. It is only a question of how one does it, and of what politics one engages in. For the rest, to us abstention is impossible. The working-class party functions as a political party in most countries by now, and it is not for us to ruin it by preaching abstention. Living experience, the political oppression of the existing governments compels the workers to occupy themselves with politics whether they like it or not, be it for political or for social goals. To preach abstention to them is to throw them into the embrace of bourgeois politics. The morning after the Paris Commune, which has made proletarian political action an order of the day, abstention is entirely out of the question.  \n\n\n>We want the abolition of classes. What is the means of achieving it? The only means is political domination of the proletariat. For all this, now that it is acknowledged by one and all, we are told not to meddle with politics. The abstentionists say they are revolutionaries, even revolutionaries par excellence. Yet revolution is a supreme political act and those who want revolution must also want the means of achieving it, that is, political action, which prepares the ground for revolution and provides the workers with the revolutionary training without which they are sure to become the dupes of the Favres and Pyats the morning after the battle. However, our politics must be working-class politics. The workers' party must never be the tagtail of any bourgeois party; it must be independent and have its goal and its own policy.  \n\n\n>The political freedoms, the right of assembly and association, and the freedom of the press \u2014 those are our weapons. Are we to sit back and abstain while somebody tries to rob us of them? It is said that a political act on our part implies that we accept the exiting state of affairs. On the contrary, so long as this state of affairs offers us the means of protesting against it, our use of these means does not signify that we recognise the prevailing order.  \n\n\n>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, \"Apropos Of Working-Class Political Action\".\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/09/21.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/09/21.htm)\n\n>Even where there is no prospect of achieving their election the workers must put up their own candidates to preserve their independence, to gauge their own strength and to bring their revolutionary position and party standpoint to public attention. They must not be led astray by the empty phrases of the democrats, who will maintain that the workers\u2019 candidates will split the democratic party and offer the forces of reaction the chance of victory. All such talk means, in the final analysis, that the proletariat is to be swindled. The progress which the proletarian party will make by operating independently in this way is infinitely more important than the disadvantages resulting from the presence of a few reactionaries in the representative body.  \n\n\n>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels , \"Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League\"\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm)",

That the first program of this party is still confused and highly deficient, that it has set up the banner of Henry George, these are inevitable evils but also only transient ones.

            "body": "Hey thanks for posting this! I feel the same way and have had many similar thoughts to you so I thought I would share them by answering your questions:\n\n1. In the form of Bernie Sanders campaign and the NDP (to speak of the Anglosphere in North America), it already has been a \u201cmajor force\u201d and likely will be again in future. But I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath. There are two ways of approaching this question in my opinion. One is from the ground-up, done by revolutionizing the workplace and communities into \u201ccommon\u201d direct democracies that are owned and operated by the members of the relevant community collectively. The other approach is from the top-down, take control of the government through democratic and/or violent means to impose socialism on society through a new government. The first method assumes that communizing workplaces and communities directly offers our best option for individuals and all humanity in honestly pursuing and attaining a \u201cgood life\u201d. This can be seen in groups like the Mondragon Corporation in Spain (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation). The second method requires popular support, funding, and all the other things that political parties and/or armies need to persist and succeed. This can be seen in the democratic sense in the form of Bernie Sanders in the USA or the NDP in Canada; in the violent sense in the form of the Russian 1917 revolution. All of this to say that these two methods have not yet manifested a \u201cmajor\u201d power in the form of a dominant governing socialist party or economic trend in North America, but that could change and successful \u201cbig\u201d movements like those of Mondragon and Bernie Sanders offer us constructive opportunities and ideas on how to work towards that.\n\n2. Some problems are not worth our energy. You know it\u2019s a bad take, I know it\u2019s a bad take, they probably know it\u2019s not a constructive take; just look away, walk away, and do you instead. Voting is and always was just one of many methods to pursuing the good life, to turn it down is simply to \u2018cut your nose to spite your face\u2019, and it\u2019s ultimately to the benefit of the right-wing populists and (especially) their masters that the left is divided in this way. You can join the socialist revolution and vote for the \u201cbest\u201d candidate in mainstream elections too, it really is that simple! \n\n2.5. I do think it is worthwhile to get invested in local communities and organizations that are outside of the established mainstream. Most importantly join communities that make you feel valuable and purposeful, because you are! Socialism, like voting, is just a method of pursuing the good life. There are other activist organizations out there too, such as LGBTQ+ Pride, Black Lives Matter, Slut Walk, and even local communities of thinkers or activists etc.. Get involved in person and try to find/establish your own community, either locally or in terms of similar tastes/activities. Some people I know swear by their faith and church, one near my old university is super pro-LGBTQ+! It is good to understand socialism, I am really enjoying exploring socialist literature and discourse, but I do not take socialism to be the be all end all solution to the problems my community, myself, or humanity at large face in the present world. On the other hand, I would be \u2018cutting my nose to spite my face\u2019 by not understanding and implementing socialist ideas, it can be a very constructive and serious perspective to take to subjects such as economics, ethics, and politics. Furthermore, we can come together against the right-wing as a society if and when we choose to. If any \u201csocialists\u201d refused to do so, then they are not the kinds of activists I am interested in and I have nothing more to say about them.",

The only domain in which it retains dominance is in force, violence and terror. Wall Street needs the use of the Pentagon war machine or U.S. supplied allies and proxies (e.g. Israel and Ukraine).   The NATO allies of the U.S. are being asked to pay more and will be offered a share of the spoils (or annihilation if they disagree).
