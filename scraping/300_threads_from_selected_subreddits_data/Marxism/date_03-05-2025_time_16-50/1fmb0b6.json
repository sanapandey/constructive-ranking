    "selftext": "What is a concentration camp? Wikipedia defines it as: \n\n\"It is a military confinement center, installed in an area of free land and surrounded by barbed wire or some other type of barrier, whose perimeter is permanently monitored, to hold prisoners of war and/or political prisoners.\"\n\nBut she doesn't leave any source from where she got this definition, and I sincerely think that this term does not have a consensus, like, when we talk about \"forced labor\" we have \"Convention No. 29, of the International Labor Organization, on Forced or Compulsory Labor\" which defines what forced labor is (And from this convention it is possible to conclude that the gulags did not exactly have forced labor because the second part of the second article, paragraph \"c\": \n\n\"However, the term \u201cforced or compulsory labour\u201d for the purposes of this Convention does not include: \n\n[...]\n\n(c) any work or service exacted from any person pursuant to a judgment rendered by a judicial authority, provided that such work or service is performed under the supervision and control of public authorities and that the said person is not assigned or placed at the disposal of private individuals, companies or corporations...\" \n\nSo in the case of \"forced labor\" we have something internationally accepted and created at the time of the socialist USSR, and so we can argue that there was no forced labor in the gulags. Now for \"concentration camp\" I couldn't find anything that says what that means and from what date a convention on what a \"concentration camp\" is was created. \n\nIf the definition is simply \"Having political prisoners\" (Since the other parts of the Wikipedia definition fit almost any common prison type \"installed in an area of free land and surrounded by barbed wire or some other type of barrier, whose perimeter is permanently guarded\" is not something uncommon in any country) then we can say that any country that chooses to criminalize political movements like Nazism is having a \"concentration camp\" or Poland that today prohibits Marxism as much as Nazism is having \"concentration camps\" (And a multitude of other countries). \n\nSocialism is a dictatorship of a class, the enemies of the proletariat will always infiltrate the party and if discovered will at best be arrested, so does this compare to the unprecedented murder committed by the Nazis against Jews? I honestly think the most correct definition would be \"Prisons for ethnic prisoners with the aim of genocide\". But honestly, until there is a consensus from an international organization that categorizes exactly what \"concentration camps\" are, I think that anyone who categorizes gulags as such is, at the very least, an asshole for equating what happened to Jews in Germany with the class enemies of socialism. \n\nEven if an internationally standardized definition of \"concentration camp\" were created today, it would be, at the very least, unfair to categorize gulags as such, because it would be like arresting someone because they committed a crime at a time when there was no law prohibiting such an act. \n\nWhat do you think?  \n\n",

They weren't just doing a genocide, they were going for histories most systematic mass killing of human beings. However one might percieve the gulag system, as far as im aware, there's no evidence that they were used simply to attain the most efficient/systematic mass killing of millions.",

            "body": "To answer your question in the title: No.\n\nBut to elaborate on it a bit more:\n\nYou're right, the term concentration camp is way too broadly defined and could mean any prison, really. What I understand under the term concentration camps are specifically the camps that were created by the Nazis, but as another comment already pointed out, those were extermination camps, not concentration camps. They are colloquially referred to as concentration camps though, and since that it what most people think of when they hear the term concentration camp, that's the definition I'll be going with.\n\nThe differences between Gulags and the Nazis' concentration camps couldn't be more staggering. Gulags were \"normal\" prisons, really. A place where criminals and political opponents were sent to. Prisoners were used as labour force, it wasn't forced labour however, since they got paid. Prisoners in Gulags weren't systematically killed; they had to serve their time and were then set free. Prisoners who showed good behaviour were often freed before they had served their full sentence.\n\nConcentration camps on the other hand were not used to lock up criminals for a certain amount of time, but to lock up people that were considered unworthy by the Nazis with the goal to exterminate them; Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, you know the drill. To compare these two institutions is absolutely vile. It disregards the hardships endured by people that were persecuted by the Nazis, all in the name of feeding a false image of the Soviet Union and communism in general.",

The \"high mortality rate\" (which if I'm not mistaken was around 5%) was not exactly due to the government's irresponsibility towards prisoners, but due to the low development of the USSR at the time.",
