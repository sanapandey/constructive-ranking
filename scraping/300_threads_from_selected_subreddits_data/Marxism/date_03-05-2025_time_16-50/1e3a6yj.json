    "selftext": "Hi everybody, as you may know, it\u2019s pretty hard to discuss capitalism and marxism with most people, so I created a group on WhatsApp for us to get together and discuss important or interesting topics related to these subjects. Here\u2019s the link: \n\nhttps://chat.whatsapp.com/LF9b9iuuiSVFKLGKmPcbNu\n\nLet\u2019s build a small community, up to 20 members, maximum. It favors organization. \n\nIf too many people are interested in the proposal, we can move to a server on discord. \n\n*Please, stay safe. Do not share personal informations.*",
