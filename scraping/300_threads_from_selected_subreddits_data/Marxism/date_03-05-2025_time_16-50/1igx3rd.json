    "selftext": "High folks. I don't support tariffs one way or the other, but I do think they raise an important issue for american consumers that we as marxists have to grapple with - namely that labor and food supply arbitrage have basically protected American consumers from the real cost of their most consumed goods - bananas, coffee, electronics, etc. Clearly we don't support the continuing of unfettered US access to international trade and exploitation, but the answer isn't quite tariffs either. When talking to other workers, citizens, what kind of explanations do people give for why free trade has failed, but that american reactionary isolationism isn't quite right either. I want to acknowledge peoples real concerns that wages have not gone up and their lives are harder than the parents, but that much of our life is predicated on massive human suffering and exploitation, and that leaning into that will not make the situation any better.

Because the development of capital and the working class are international phenomena, because the centralisation and the sweeping away of national barriers to capitals development prepares the way for the international division of labour and the creation of an international planned economy, because national reactions to the internationalisation of capital seek to offset the cost of the devaluation of capital onto other nations, increasing trade wars and ultimately real wars. \n\nThe collapse of the liberal postwar bourgeoisie's attempts to create a rules based international camouflage for the super exploitation of the colonial and semi colonial world is a sign that the ruling class is rotting on its feet. \n\nWe should not support the imposition of reactionary national tariffs any more than we support the imposition of immigration controls.  \n\nHere is Engels' famous report of Marx's speech on free trade\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1888/free-trade/index.htm",

            "body": "The way I look at it is that each person who can work should be involved in creating something of value not just for their own country but for the world. If you talk to most people in the US, they probably can\u2019t tell you how their work actually materially benefits other people.\n\nWhen we have finally reached the point where we have ownership over our labor and transitioned away from imperialism as a business model (which will likely be a result of the third world forcing our hand), a much larger share of us will be involved in industries like food production, healthcare/ medicine, housing, plumbing/ electrical, manufacturing, raw material and energy production instead of primarily exploitative fields like marketing, retail sales, entertainment and other \u2018consumer discretionary\u2019 pursuits. (Scientific research, education, and conservation come to mind as necessary fields as well)\n\nBy eliminating unnecessary work and using our own labor to meet our own basic needs instead of relying on economic parasitism, we will hopefully be able to produce enough to provide for everyone in the US with a surplus which can be traded for goods that we can\u2019t domestically produce. Those goods might be more expensive as a result, although if they\u2019re necessary (like medicine for example) the government should take the burden of the price.",

Obviously during this time of \"resistance\" liberals, there is a broad swath of people on the \"left\" - and even some socialists, though I debate that label for them - think the knee jerk reaction is to do whatever the opposite of Trumps plan is.",

            "body": "On a not so philosophical note: one of the fundamental problems of the American economy in the Post-Reagan era is that a group of countries used the factual reliance of the US on free trade to undercut the prices of American industry and make the US into a gigantic debtor. \n\nSince the beginning of this century the American trade deficit exceeds its growth, which means that there is a constant flow of capital from the US to other countries. The fact that foreign goods are in many areas significantly cheaper than American goods (especially machines, robotics, vehicles, electronics) has led to the deindustrialization of the American economy. A significant amount of public and private debt in the US is because of the trade deficit. The accumulated debt of the US in the 2010s with China is around 1.2 - 1.3 trillion and with Germany about 600-800 bln Dollar.\n\nSince it is only a handful of countries that most of the trade deficit is with (China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Italy, Israel, Switzerland), American administrations constantly try to pressure these countries into changing their economic strategy. Trump's tariffs are a result of the utter ignorance of these countries' governments for such demands. It is a sign of weakness.",
