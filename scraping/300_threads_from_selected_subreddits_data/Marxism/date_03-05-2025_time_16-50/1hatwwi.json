I agree that the example you list keeping all conditions ceteris paribus except for the quantity produced is most likely what Marx is thinking in the quote you provided. \n\nKeep in mind that the new machine can be cheaper than the old machine and it can also be more durable. So the depreciation it imparts on each particular commodity, or during each hour, can also be lower than the old production conditions (in addition to better conservation of raw materials).",

Each engineer is going to be payed, say, $50/hour either way, right?\n\nAlso, someone somewhere is going to decide how many bicycles are needed per year. And, this is how many will be produced, with the required labor. If that Central Planning Committee is wrong by 20%, and they produce 20% too many, what do you do with the extra 20%?\n\nIf you fall short by 20%, you have caused some segment of society to fail to benefit from that 20% of bicycles.\n\nEither way, you get 20% inefficiency. the Central Planners have to be very accurate, or you have 20% inefficiency in tractors, bicycles, cars, airplanes, sinks, manhole covers, light switches, etc.\n\nThis rivals the hypothetical efficiencies in the noted production equations.\n\nWhat to do? Another Committee is needed to figure out how to address inefficiencies as they become apparent.",

They will do that with the least harm to the environment, with no crime as the machines are free, and there's no money, because labour vouchers are no longer needed. Because society has transcended so highly by now, any over production will be coped with, recycled etc.  \n\nThe thing is, this isn't capitalism or something like capitalism but nicer.
