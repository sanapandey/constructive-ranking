    "selftext": "Hey there, my name is Dante. I\u2019m a young Marxist whose goal is self-education in Marxist theory, to the effect that it may be one day used in praxis, so I may assist the global proletariat in intensifying class struggle in the advent of rampant imperialist capitalism and its epiphenomenal catastrophes. Currently, I am trying to do so in the form of a discord group consisting of a few dedicated members sharing our thoughts and having discussions on different pieces of Marxist literature. I know many may flock to the comments as to have a go at our methods lacking a sense of concreteness and whilst these criticisms are not unfounded and understandable, there cannot be a denial of the utility of online platforms for the purpose of education and global networking. I have no reservations about a revolution occurring purely in a digital space, however as marxist, we must adopt a tendency to be as ubiquitous as our political opponents. One of our primary goals, as a group, is to rectify the absence in concrete policy and tendencies towards revisionism, especially within the global north, we are trying to organize with a certain stringency in operational principles, allowing discourse yet unified in established objectives. Our aim is not a matter of quantity, but one of quality, to paraphrase Castro, \u201cI enacted a revolution with 82 men, I would do it all again with 15 trustworthy ones and as strong will.\u201d Based on these notions, we intend to build our own group. Our ultimate goal will however not be lost, in trying to affect real world change, we acknowledge that times are dire and are something that can presently only be conceived as a finite resource, but we can only have faith that we will be prepared enough when the time comes. If any of this interests you, feel free to message me and lets chat. Have a good day!",
