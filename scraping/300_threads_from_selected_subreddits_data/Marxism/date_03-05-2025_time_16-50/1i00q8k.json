Like if they pay you $20 and hour but you bring in $25/hr worth of value to the company than you are being exploited for $5 an hour.\n\nBut is that not just consumer surplus? The same argument can be made on any product that you buy ever. The only reason to buy anything is because our personal willingness to pay at that moment is higher than the price. I want a Nintendo switch. It costs $300 and at that time I personally value the switch at $500 so there is a $200 consumer surplus. I don\u2019t think in that instance it would be fair to say I exploited Nintendo.\n\nIs there some nuance I don\u2019t understand in the argument that makes the labor market different?",

The surplus of their labor goes to capitalists, who do not contribute anything to the product of that labor.\n\nNintendo is not forced to sell you a Switch. The fact that you subjectively value a commodity higher than its exchange value does not mean you're exploiting them. You are not taking anything from Nintendo by buying their product at a price they set.\n\nOn the other hand, capitalists manipulate the labor market to suppress wages. They ensure a level of unemployment (what Marx calls \"the reserve army of labor\") as a means to make it harder for workers to demand higher wages, because anyone who demands higher wages can simply be fired and replaced by another desperate worker. Workers cannot set the cost of their labor fairly because they are not equal participants in the labor market. Unions are an attempt to combat this dynamic, which is why capitalists hire Pinkertons and use the police to break up unions, going so far as to imprison and murder labor organizers. No one is going to kill you because you refuse to buy a Switch until its price falls within your valuation.",

Our ability to do labor becomes a commodity (ie a marketable thing valued for exchange/monetary value) in capitalism and we are paid \u201cfairly\u201d based in the value of that \u201ccommodity\u201d that we sell to that employer. But we aren\u2019t selling the actual labor we do like an artisan or independent contractor, we are paid the market value of our general working potential. This is why general or unskilled labor\u2026 no matter how much more demanding or demeaning or difficult tends to be paid less than something more specialized or skilled.\n\nThe market value of that labor is based on the effort it takes to create that commodity\u2026 so this means our labor is worth what it costs to keep a roof over our head and food, each day that resource is replenished as long as we have basic human necessities. \n\nBecause as a pool of labor we are in competition for jobs as individuals\u2026 this pushes labor cost (wages) down towards that baseline of cost to reproduce ourself each day. Skilled labor requires more effort and so it \u201ccosts more\u201d to replenish that kind of labor for capitalists.\n\nSo human labor is a commodity that replenishes but can produce more than it\u2019s value. Alternately, a machine is bought for with an estimate of how much that machine can produce over its lifetime. If you need to contact you sell the machine or turn it off but can\u2019t fire it or cut its hours to reduce the cost of that machine. It is \u201cdead labor\u201d in Marxist terms\u2026 not flexible and regenerative but fixed.\n\nIn this way, by ignoring that humans are human rather than cogs and tools of capital, capitalism can present itself as a non-exploitative \u201cfair\u201d deal. \n\nBut our life\u2019s effort and time and passion are subjectively something that should not be an asset to sell just to live. Capitalism can not help but be an inhuman system that turns us into grease for the wheels.\n\n(And this is all general trends! if natural gas booms, bosses might pay more to drivers than under normal circumstances because they have an urgent need for that labor. If we organize and win concessions we can change the \u201cvalue\u201d of our labor.)",

Even if you\u2019re a staunch anti-communist you should read at least that much Marx so as to understand his theory.  \n\nYou\u2019re thinking of value as something subjective, e.g. \u201ccommodity X is worth $100 *to me* and $50 to someone else\u201d (this is of course the typical way of thinking of value nowadays), but Marx views value as objective, independent of anyone\u2019s preferences (to a certain extent; a commodity does have to have *use-value*, which is subjective, in order to have *value*). In particular, he makes the assumption that all commodities are sold at their value (on average, i.e., profit is not made by swindling), and he comes to the conclusion that the value of a commodity is determined by the *socially necessary labor-time* to produce it. That is, if under average conditions at a certain level of technology, it takes 1 hour to turn a certain amount of wood into a table, then the value of a table is the value of the wood plus the value of an hour of labor.  \n\nSo for your example, we might suppose that the materials to produce a Switch are $200 and the labor is worth $100, so that the final value is $300. It doesn\u2019t matter that *you* would be willing to pay more for it, it\u2019s sold at its value, and thus Nintendo is not swindled\u2014 if anything you would be swindled by your own irrationality (by which I mean you are *not* a perfect calculator of your own utility and the value of all commodities, contrary to the assumptions of liberal economics) if Nintendo did charge you $500.  \n\nThe exploitation of the scenario has little to do with the sale\u2014 it is neither the consumer nor the company that is exploited. The exploitation Marx cares about is that of the worker whose labor added $100 of value to the Switch. If Nintendo made a profit, that worker was paid less than $100, say $50. Their wage is determined by the value of their *labor power*, that is, the *ability to do work*, since they are paid not for a certain amount of labor (since then they would have to be paid $100) but for a certain expenditure of labor power. The value of labor power is the value needed to sustain the worker, or more precisely, the value required to reproduce their labor power. This is determined by the value of food, shelter, any training necessary, etc. But the value created by the expenditure of labor power is irrelevant to this calculation. Then what exploitation is, and what makes profit possible, is the fact that the worker produces $100 of value, but is paid only $50, because they are paid not for the labor they add, but the labor power they expend.",

Capitalists are consumers in the market too and they wouldn't make a profit if every other capitalist was arbitrarily tacking on some price.\nSurplus value comes from the difference in the amount of labor it takes to reproduce oneself (to reproduce their laboring power) and the amount of labor one can expend -- we can produce more than we need, and it is only for that latter piece that one gets paid.",

A total of 7 people were required to run that line, alongside 6 robots and machinery. Those 7 people made less than $24/hr each. The raw materials were around $5000 per hour.

The value of your labor power is the socially necessary labor time required to produce your labor power, and your wages are supposed to match this. Exploitation occurs because the work day does not end when a worker produces an equivalent amount of commodities to compensate them for their labor power. Workers work surplus labor time during which they produce surplus value. This is a roundabout way of saying that capitalist society as a whole is very productive because it gets workers across society to produce a surplus. This is not a moral judgment but it does bode poorly for workers because that they will be forced to produce a surplus and it means that there must be an inequality of power between workers and capitalists. All workers are exploited in a capitalist society because the underlying rule of capitalist society is that workers are required to work surplus labor time.\n\n>> The only reason to buy anything is because our personal willingness to pay at that moment is higher than the price.\n\nMarx is describing the way a capitalist society must be organized if it is to produce profit at a macroeconomic level, if it is to produce a profit. This is not a theory of individual behavior, although it is not incompatible with the marginalists' theory of the consumer. Marx's point is that capitalist society must be arranged so that workers are coerced into working surplus labor time. No worker benefits from working this time, so there is a class struggle (i.e. politics) to reduce/eliminate it.\n\n>> I don\u2019t think in that instance it would be fair to say I exploited Nintendo.\n\nWhen you buy Nintendo products you are buying commodities which were produced by exploited workers, so, in a way, we do reproduce a pattern which is oppressive to ourselves, but again this is not a theory of individuals, nor is it really a moral theory. It is an explanation of how capitalist society produces profit and why that is incompatible with flourishing democracy.\n\nWhat is confusing you is that mainstream economics (which is where you are getting this idea of value being tied to individual choice) refuses to think about power and the way society is arranged. Instead it creates a very silly image of society as a mere collection of individuals.",

This is trying to apply a concept of marginalism that ignores the actual impossibility of equating desire for qualitatively use values as price.\n\nHow do I compare the satisfaction for a lager at the pub with a new game on Nintendo switch? \n\nYes, there is a real world trade off where you have limited money to spend and one choice may foreclose another. But how do you quantify your desire?\n\nWhat is $200 surplus referring to? Well, that you as an individual would purchase it still if it were $500.\nYou might be stoked that it\u2019s so cheap but that satisfaction isn\u2019t equivalent to $200. \n\nHow does one price satisfaction?\nMarginalism doesn\u2019t have an adequate theory to jump to price as it merely generalizes immediate bartered exchange and generalizes the certainty within that exchange onto a world of commodities mediated by money.\n\nhttps://kapitalism101.wordpress.com/tag/marginalism/\n\u201cThe existence of money demands that we immediately abandon the basic principles of marginal utility. In the simple barter models posed by marginalists both actors can fully judge the use-values of items they are trading. But when we are exchanging things for money we are not just trading two commodities in isolation. Money links each commodity to an entire of world of commodities. Now if it was possible to know the future values of all commodities then it would be possible to generalize the marginalist barter model into a theory of indirect exchange. But we don\u2019t know the future values of things. These are entirely uncertain. In fact, If the values of all commodities were always known we wouldn\u2019t need money because any commodity could serve as money. This compromises the entire marginalist model.\n\nIn other words, marginalism can only have a theory of indirect exchange (of commodities traded for money instead of commodities bartered with each other) is all parties have perfect information on prices. But if we make this assumption we can no longer explain competition (or money).\u201d\n\nAnd marginalism doesn\u2019t explain how commodities are commensurable and takes prices as a given as it only examines appearances but doesn\u2019t infer their nature.\nhttps://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4949&context=lcp\n\u201cThat vision, however appealing, turns on an axiomatic approach to money that is not conceptually sound. In particular, we cannot assume that the act of comparison, carried out across different objects by many independent actors, creates commensurability at the level of value\u2019s expression over the relevant universe of entities compared. On second look, the Walrasian model at the heart of general equilibrium theory claims no such thing.7 In that model, the unit of account precedes rather than follows the act of comparison. Partial equilibrium models likewise assume a working medium. In other words, neoclassical thought itself ascribes a unit that will make value commensurable. The unit is abstract and therefore neutral; it is a device that transparently expresses value without more. That move is essential to every activity that follows: it enables comparison, choice, and, eventually, exchange. It thus makes possible market activity as a process that aggregates individualized preferences and produces prices.\n\nHaving assumed a unit that makes values commensurable, neoclassical thinkers can relegate all other questions about what actual money is and what role it plays to the realm of applied science.8 That deferral is terrifically enabling. It allows economists to explain actually observed moneys that don\u2019t conform to the abstraction in ways consistent with normative premises of equilibrium models. Thus neoclassical thinkers define money in the real world in ways that tack close to their presumptions about how money should look: they assume that exchange activity among equally situated individuals suffices to produce a medium as bartering individuals converge on a commodity or agree to an empty measure as a convention. Although those moneys fail to resemble the unit of account imputed by Walras\u2014they are either material and non-neutral or nonmaterial and meaningless\u2014those problems are not categorized as fatal.9 To the contrary, economists can correct for monetary dynamics while identifying those dynamics as distortions, given money\u2019s deviation in the real world from the Walrasian abstraction.\n\nIn effect, neoclassical economics imputes a term to resolve the challenge of commensurability at the conceptual level: it assumes money as an abstract and neutral unit of account. The discipline subsequently explains moneys actually observed: it focuses here on money as a medium emerging from trade. The sleight of hand submerges the issue of incommensurable values. Incongruities are set aside as the byproduct of difficulties on the ground.\n...\nThe basic point is that some commensurability in value allows comparison among the wide heterogeneity of commodifiable items. Neoclassical theory has split again and again in its debates over value, from the subjectivism of Bentham\u2019s utility to the methods for comparing pairs of preferences.22 Implicit across those debates, however, is an agreement that comparison is possible, even if in an abstract term.\n...\nThe problem of commensurability is different. It poses the challenge of comparison: how is it possible to compare an orange to an advance of resources, or a dog to military service? What about the relationship of any of those to the possession of land or art, or to the obligation to support the public order? That question, infinitely harder, is virtually nonexistent in the economic literature on money.43 That neglect, in contrast to the intense focus on the issue of the double coincidence of wants, occurs because Walras\u2019s auction has done its work. It has established the intuitive power of the market-as-a-huge-bazaar, an orgy of real exchange among objects of comparable value.44\n...\nNarratives that propose an empty measure provide no reference point against which comparison can proceed. Money, even if considered only as a unit of account, is nothing like an inch or a pound. Those metrics are more like denominations; they divide a matter already commensurable, like linear space or weight. By contrast, money creates a reference point for an amorphous matter: value. To this day, neither economists nor philosophers have agreed upon how to conceptualize the \u201cvalue\u201d of time, goods, services, satisfactions, or desires. Once that is done monetarily\u2014the whole trick\u2014no one really cares much how denominations are ordained to subdivide existing value.\u201d",

Revenue - raw material cost - machinery cost (spare parts) - utilities - wage labor = profit.\n\n120k - 15k - 5k - 2k - 36k = $62k\n\nSo that's $62k of raw profit per week. Let's say somehow this company is paying it's fair share in taxes, and let's even stretch it to say that the fair share of taxes and paying for employee healthcare/benefits is ~50%. Now we're at roughly $30k of in pocket profit per week. \n\nThe capitalist economist would say that this profit is \"deserved\" because the capitalist has taken on a risk and started up a business, and in doing so, is being rewarded. But this \"risk\" ended up paying for the warehouse in 20 weeks, and then the machinery in less than an additional 10 weeks. Once everything has been paid off, the capitalist finds a new piece of equipment that can double the amount of coats produced. Instead of letting the workers enjoy a reduced 30 hour work week, the capitalist decides to fire half of them, thus reducing their labor cost in half, while generating the same amount of revenue. Add more \"business intelligence\" and the capitalist keeps breeding money with money, at the expense of those who are producing the value for him.\n\nIf you're interested in this sort of analysis, I recommend reading through Marx's Capital.",

Is the justification for the arrangement still that some point long in the past a risk was taken in order to accumulate the capital?  Can that chain simply be followed all the way back to original(primitive) accumulation?\n\nAlso we understand that capital begets capital.  In the modern economy there is a \u201crisk free rate of return(RFR).\u201d  While individual capitalists take risks, it is all on top of that RFR - it\u2019s not like a casino where the house odds are against you, or even straight odds, but in the aggregate the risk pays off.  That \u201crisk\u201d generally only  affects the distribution of wealth between individual capitalists, the capitalist class in aggregate is not taking a risk yet the wealth disparity between them and the working class continues to grow.",

To unpack this a bit, because it's really fairly simple:\n\n\nA worker does not sell their labor to their employer. This is a misconception. What a worker sells their employer is their *labor power*, at a per-hour rate. This means, the worker receives the same pay for the same time *regardless of how much value their labor produces* during that time. So, an employee may produce $500 worth of commodities (or other value-forms, including services or overhead administration) during that time, but they may receive only $50 in wages because that is the going rate for their *labor power*.\n\n\nThis is the disconnect that allows the capitalist to exploit the worker while *appearing* to make a fair exchange. The actual value the worker creates for the capitalist is not what the capitalist pays the worker for, and the separation of the two things creates a separate commodity-form for labor power which capitalists are able to manipulate to be worth *far less* than the value it produces. Hence, workers are always paid less than the value of what they produce, while being told (and in practice unfortunately usually believing) that they have been fairly compensated.",
