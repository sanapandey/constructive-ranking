    "selftext": "Since the question of the Russian-Ukrainian war has come up several times now, I thought it would be instructive to post an excerpt from the recollections of the Serbian socialist and one of the founders of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, Milan Nedi\u0107 (a mathematician, not the collaborationist general), on the attitude of Serbian socialists to WWI. The text is translated by S. Gu\u017evica, a communist historian:\n\n\"One day \\[in Paris in 1918\\] the chamber of labor was invited to a conference organized by some American socialists. Aca Pavlovi\u0107 and I were delegated to attend on behalf of the Serbian social-democrats. At the conference, they asked us the question, 'What are your territorial demands?' I was stunned. I replied that we are not bourgeois statesmen. Then the president of the American Party told us that this is foolish, and we should state clearly what we want. I replied, 'we wish defeat upon everyone' and left the room.\"\n\nActually, the last line can be translated \"we wish ruin upon everyone\" (the original is \"Mi \u017eelimo svima propast.\").",

If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics.

Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them.
