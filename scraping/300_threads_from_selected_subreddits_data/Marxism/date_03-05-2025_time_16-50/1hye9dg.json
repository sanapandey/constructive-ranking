They are not paid a wage by their landlord, they own their tools and what they produce, and they pay some of it to him as rent. They are alienated from the land and their home, but not from their labor and produced goods. They are a (usually subjugated) petty bourgeois class, not proletarian. Proletarians do not own any means of production and sell their labor power for a wage, they don\u2019t, for example, pay the factory owner for the right to use his machines to make goods for themselves to sell or consume.",

            "body": "The peasantry is a social category but not a distinct class. When one stratifies the peasantry conceptually, it includes both a higher peasantry who are land owners and employers themselves but are still engaged in working the land, the middle peasantry owning land but not able to control the labour of others beyond their families, and the landless peasants.\n\nWhat distinguishes the middle and landless peasant from the proletarian?  It is the relation to the means of production. The middle peasant owns the land and tools that he or she works. The landless peasant, unlike the proletarian, does not freely own and dispose of their labour power, and cannot contract with any employer they choose, but is tied to the land and at the disposition of the kulak/upper peasant or the land owner. Note that the land owner may not be a peasant but could be, and today almost everywhere is, a capitalist. \n\nCorrespondingly, those who work on the land are increasingly no longer peasants per se, but rural proletarians. One would have to say, at the same time, that the rural proletariat is more widely exposed to non-economic forms of coercion than the urban proletariat, including elements of bonded labour, semi slavery, forced movement by gangs and so on.\n\nCritical to approaching class analysis of the workforce is to remember that class is not an identity or a blood group but a relation. An individual may therefore bear in their personal relationships with the means of production a combination of elements of different class relationships. A seasonal labourer might find herself a peasant for part of the year, a proletarian for another part of the year, a bonded labourer for another part of the year, and a slave in the home.",

            "body": "There's multiple individual relations that peasants can have towards their peasantry. They can be tenant farmers that serve a landlord that usually have some rights to the Land and what they produce. They can usually keep the production themselves, sell the surplus, and pay the landlord and keep the profits. Then there are peasants who own the land and the produce completely, and can sell the surplus as they see fit. The tenant peasants are most prone to being proletarianized as they lack ownership of the land. However, they can also be successful and eventually buy the land themselves, and eventually begin employing laborers. \n\nA farm worker, who's only able to sell their labor, is not a peasant. They are not a farmer, they are not a peasant, they are an agricultural proletarian. \n\nSo the fundamental difference of a peasant versus a farm worker is their relation to the Land, ownership of production, and the nature of their labor. \n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/ch12.htm\n\nEdit: came up with a practical example for the modern developed economy. \n\nGrandparent owns farmland, passes on to grandchild. Grandchild themselves doesn't know how to farm. But can find a farmer to rent the farmland and produce on it. Farmer owns tractors, tools, etc, to farm and upkeep the land. They pay rents to the landlord, but own the produce and any tools and livestock that work and live off the land. They do not sell their labor exclusively, but own their own means of production, except for the ownership rights of the land itself.",

The lord may \"own\" it but they had a lot of liberty to choose how exactly to utilize it. They weren't exactly selling their labor power. They shared directly in not only the product of what they produced but also governed themselves in many ways.\n\nOf course the time period and locale matters greatly when considering this. If you are looking at the Scots in the certain eras of British history then you going to see little of these liberties and a ton of oppression and exploitation. If you are looking at a place like mid-Europe in the 1300s then you might see a ton of liberties that would make even modern workers envious.\n\nIn mainland Europe if one lord was particularly oppressive he would see his peasants leave for better land opportunities elsewhere. And in fact, many landlords would try and entice peasants to come and work their lands with all manner of perks.\n\nIt's hard to imagine a system where the owner of the capital just says, \"okay here ya go see you at harvest time\" and leaves you to it because our system is so managed and we never have any right whatsoever to directly benefit from the product of our labor. Then at harvest says, \"alright I'll take my 3 bushels\" or whatever and fucks off until next year. In this situation it's more like a tax than anything. And of course you aren't even being governed by the lord. You have local councils and other systems, sometimes elected even from the peasantry themselves, enforcing rules and making sure your community runs well. Obviously the whole thing is a bit more complicated but that is just not how it works in capitalism at all.\n\nThis is my understanding, at least.",
