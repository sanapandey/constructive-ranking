Including Biden.\n\nCalling it \"Trump's war on Cuba\" is disingenuous.\n\nBiden increased sanctions in 2021 and said \"There will be more, unless there's some drastic change in Cuba, which I don't anticipate,\" Biden said during a meeting with Cuban-American leaders at the White House.",

Biden has been one of the more anti-Cuban presidents, especially compared to Obama\n\n(not that Obama was all that great, but he at least loosened things re Cuba slightly)",
