There were numerous jump cuts that clearly show how scripted it is that these children are saying, and that they don't believe this themselves. \n\nWhy do we let these mods control r/socialism as if they privately own the space?

Which is important (15000 children have been murdered in Gaza). \n\nSecondly- for a dialectical analysis you need to identify a contradiction. But I would say that the contradiction here is based on a false assumption. Just because something is scripted (even by somebody else) does not mean that the person saying it doesn't believe it. Nor do jump cuts necessarily represent the film maker being disingenuous. Rather, a generous (and we should be generous with our comrades) interpretation would be that the piece is edited to make the argument as short, powerful and convincing as possible. \n\nI would suggest, that perhaps the mods didn't think it was appropriate to include your argument, in that particular discussion considering the context.",

What he said is that tankies are a manifestation of the same adolescent tendency we see with teenagers who get into Ayn Rand. They know instinctively that liberalism is dumb and self-contradictory, but they\u2019re kids. They want to rage against the machine, but they don\u2019t have any-other frame of reference for how the world should work. Then they find a thinker or philosophy that contradicts the zeitgeist, and make it their identity. Just like Rand and her secularist right-wing fore-bearers where a reaction to the close-minded dogmatism of the religious-right, so too tankies are rebelling against the neo-liberal world order. It\u2019s just that they think that since Amerika\u2019s evil, all its enemies must be good. Which is clearly not cogent.\n\nWe, adult\u2019s think \u201cI believe labor is entitled to the full value of production, ergo I am a socialist.\u201d But tankies think \u201cI am a socialist, so I must look, act, think, and believe a certain way.\u201d Karl Marx is no longer a great thinker to be studied, scrutinized and discussed; but instead a prophet never to be questioned.\n\nI was looking into the rules of R/Socialism earlier, and specifically says \u201cNo liberalism,\u201d citing it as \u201canti-socialist,\u201d without any kind of basic definition of liberalism is or what makes it different from socialism. It\u2019s really vague. \u201cThese rules are strictly enforced,\u201d which they demonstrate by banning anyone who mentions the fact that China stopped trying to be socialist decades ago. And can you expect anyone who grew up under late-stage capitalism to be divoide of liberal influence? For them, socialism isn\u2019t about empowering the working class, it\u2019s about cosplaying as Lenin and acting better then everyone else because they have the right beliefs.",
