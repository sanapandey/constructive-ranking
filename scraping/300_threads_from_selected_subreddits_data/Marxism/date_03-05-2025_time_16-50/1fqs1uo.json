    "selftext": "Hi! Even though I am familiar with marxism, throughout my whole undergraduate and postgraduate life I have focused on literary theory. I have read marxist literary theorist and the Manifesto, apart from some contemporary marxist-leaning books and I am acquainted with most basic concepts. The thing is this: Luk\u00e1cs has kind of defeated me, I now realize I don\u2019t know as much as I thought. I thought I knew enough and I do know more than the average person (I guess), but I want to study marxist thought in a more serious way. What I am asking for is a sort of itinerary. I know that principles of communism and the manifesto always come first, but from there on I am not sure where should I continue. I know in my hear I agree with the basics but I want to know as much as I can.\n\nI do not need a reading guide per each book or anything, just please some help to elaborate a sort of syllabus (? for myself that helps me get a solid base. Also I understand this might come across as confusing, as you\u2019ve probably guessed, English is not my first language. \n\nThanks!",

The Grundrisse was essentially Marx\u2019s notes used to write Capital. The Intro is short and so is The 18th Brumaire. So could be helpful to dip in with those first.\n\nAlso, Lenin\u2019s \u201cKarl Marx\u201d.",

            "body": "Marx's best works contain the word \"critique\" in them. By all means, tackle \"Capital\", but I found it IMMENSELY helpful to read John Grier Hibben's \"Science of Logic\" beforehand. It made Hegel's dialectic, and in turn, \"Capital\", so much easier to understand. More than anything, I found the central concept of \"value form\" and its use (outlined in Hibben) a kind of skeleton key, through which forms the key conceptual basis of  \"Capital\", especially chapter one, which is commonly referred to as the most challenging.\n\nOther suggestions would include Lenin's \"Collected Works\", Volume 38 Philosophical Notebooks, II Rubin's \"Essay on Marx's Theory of Value\", \"A Dictionary of Marxist Thought\", and George Novak's \"The logic of Marxism\"\n\nGood luck!",

Never be afraid to begin again, to throw out your preconceived notions and what secondary sources like Eagleton (or wherever you get your marxist literary theory) say. Secondary sources are useful for giving context and collecting disparate writings of Marx to construct a coherent narrative out of. But the primary sources will obviously tell you more. \n\n**Suggested primary sources:**\n\nA Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy\n\n18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte\n\nThe Poverty of Philosophy\n\nAnti-D\u00fchring\n\nCapital Vol 1-3\n\n**Suggested Secondary Sources:**\n\nMute Compulsion by S\u00f8ren Mau\n\nAn Introduction to the Three Volumes of Marx's Capital by Michael Heinrich\n\nKarl Marx by Karl Korsch\n\nMarx, Marginalism, and Modern Sociology by Simon Clarke",

            "body": "Don't be too afraid to pick up Capital vol. 1. It's genuinely not a difficult book. It will take some dedication, sure, but it's entirely doable. However, if you want a quick warm up first (which isn't a bad idea), try reading some of Marx's pamphlets, e.g. Wage-Labour & Capital, and Value, Profit & Price. These are very short and will help you familiarise yourself with Marx's style, terminology and general method. I'd also strongly recommend reading Ernest Mandel's Introduction to Capital, published in the Penguin editions of the book.\n\n\nI come from a literary theory background too, and I can assure you that there's nothing in Capital that is any harder or more complicated than any literary theorist you've read already. It's certainly easier than Lukacs' History & Class Consciousness.\n\n\nReading Marx's Capital will give you a solid grasp of what Marx was about. We also desperately need more literature students to read Capital, as it's a book that often falls victim to rigid and dogmatic readings.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you loved Capital, then you should read I.I. Rubin's *Essays on Marx's Theory of Value*. It's one of the greatest texts I've encountered on value theory. But for a more conventional approach to Marx / Marxism (often these things are surprisingly different), it's not a bad idea to read Lenin's State and Revolution.\u00a0",
