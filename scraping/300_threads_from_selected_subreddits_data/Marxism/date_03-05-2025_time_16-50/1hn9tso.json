    "selftext": "Karl Marx and his progeny demonstrated, using exacting logic, the workings of a capitalist system. \n\nBut what are the results of these workings? \n\nThat a very small portion of the population exerts dictatorial control over all facets of human social life \u2014 this is the true nature of capitalism. Capitalism\u2019s sole and exclusive function is to ensure the continuation of bourgeois supremacy. The bourgeoisie know it, but the rest of the population does not. \n\nTherefore, we must always make sure that we designate the clear enemy, the bourgeoise. If our politics does not orient itself around demonstrating this enemy, then we have a false politics. ",

Yes, we have opposing interests and will resort to repressive measures to get our way but the opposing class isn't some external threat that can simply be exterminated. Rather, it is the product of social activity including our own. We need to replace the system with another one, thereby abolishing both our own and \"the enemy's\" class at once, since they are mutually constituting.",

Marxism as a materialist analysis of self-reproducing social systems isn\u2019t necessarily interested in making \u201cenemies\u201d. \n\nI find this to be basically a wrongheaded view. While you and /u/Techno_Femme are correct to point out that Marx\u2019s analysis is of a social system, not the behavior of individuals as such, quoting Mao, [\u201c[t]he basic reason why all previous revolutionary struggles in China achieved so little was their failure to unite with real friends in order to attack real enemies.\u201d](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_1.htm) \n\nMarxism\u2019s political practice must be oriented toward the usurpation of power from the bourgeoisie. But of course, and more to your point, this will require an active ideological and theoretical struggle, and it is impossible to wage that without a correct theory of capitalism as a system. But the goal ought to be clear cut.",

Marx, several times in capital, talks about hypotheticals where market economies of exclusively state firms and/or cooperatives are still subject to the laws of capitalism. The impersonal domination of the market is our enemy. Capitalists are only the current manifestation of it and could be replaced by representatives in different social positions.",

Maybe \"enemy\" is the wrong word, but OP is absolutely right nevertheless. I mean, some of the *liberal* bourgeois might not be fully conscious of their role as a class as a lot believe their own bullshit about \"equality before the law\" etc., but as marxists is it not true that, first and foremost, our main enemy as a class is the bourgeoisie?",
