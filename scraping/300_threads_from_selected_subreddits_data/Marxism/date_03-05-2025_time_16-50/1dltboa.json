    "selftext": "I mean this has always been going on to some extent, but I guess the difference is that exploitation of consumers isn't intrinsic to the capitalist mode of production, whereas theoretically you could have a capitalist society where the capitalists do not exploit consumers at all. However, with the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, it seems like the necessity can only increase for capitalism to exploit consumers as well as workers. It seems like after a while, exploitation of consumers will be as integral to the survival of capitalism as exploitation of workers (if it isn't already integral).",

            "body": "Exploitation in the productive process has a specific definition beyond the generic use of the word, in that it is the extraction of surplus value from the labour of the working class above the price of purchasing their labour power, wages. This has no relevance to the relationship between consumers and the capitalists.\n\n\n\nConsumers may be exploited, in the sense they are persuaded to purchase goods at prices above their labour value or that they really do not want or need. To this end the increasing sophistication and manipulation inherent in modern marketing makes the consumer a more efficient market for their commodities. The monopolization and overproduction of the market incentivizes more manipulative marketing. In this sense exploitation has increased but it is not related to that in the supply process.",

You pay the worker less in order to increase profit and now the worker is unable to function as a consumer which causes a crisis of overproduction. \n\nThe consumer identity itself exists to paper over class consciousness. The worker is a consumer just like the small business owner is a consumer, that\u2019s what makes us all equals under capitalism. Except we aren\u2019t.",

I guess the underlying situation would be the same, whether with price gouging or shoddy commodities, the capitalist seeks to minimize capital expenditure on the commodity while maximizing value extracted from the consumer. Gouging would assist with maximizing value extraction, and shoddy commodities would assist with minimizing capital expenditure, but both assist in getting the ratio of capital expenditure:value extraction as close to 0:infinity as possible.",

For instance, water from a natural source being privatized and while the demand for water is inelastic, the owners of the source control the supply which in turn means they control the price. No one can boycott the water without dying so even if it's immoral or not feasible for a poor person to pay 40 dollars for a gallon of water, they are forced to due to their material position. This is one of many ways consumers are exploited",
