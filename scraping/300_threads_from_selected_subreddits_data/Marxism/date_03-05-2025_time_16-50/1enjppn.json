Marx developed the foundational framework from which all Marxists base their conclusions, so there really isn't need to develop the framework of Marxism beyond what Marx wrote about. The only work necessary for modern Marxist philosophers is applying the principles of dialectical materialism to modern-day events. \n\n>what books/literature are post marx and are good marxist theory\n\nLenin, Bordiga, and Pannekoek are all good post-Marx Marxists who strictly adhere to a materialist framework and do not deviate from this mode of analysis like Stalin and his contemporaries. I'd specifically recommend Workers' Councils and Anarchism and Socialism by Pannekoek, Dialogue With Stalin by Bordiga, and really anything you're interested in reading from Lenin.",

            "body": "It might be easier to give you some reasons Marxism is the superior economic theory, rather than political theory. \n\nThe main reason is straightforward: Marxism is _political_ economy and not just economics. It is an integrated theory of politics and economics. Orthodox economics has relied (with many variations and qualifications) on a model of the market which assumes all buyers and sellers are free to set prices in the act of exchange, and that market prices anneal to the underlying value of goods through the rationality of buyers and sellers. \n\nBut this is manifestly not the case: we live in a world in which a minority of holders of the means of production monopolise that production, compelling the majority to buy goods the controllers of production \"own\" with money the buyers possess, at prices set to maintain and increase the control of these controllers, the owners of this \"capital\".\n\nFor the majority to possess at any point the money necessary to buy the necessary goods, the system offers no alternative but for the majority to \"earn\" by working for the owners and selling its \"labour-power\" for a wage.\n\nThe regime of these \"capitalists\" is upheld by a state which protects private property, suppresses political upheaval with its violence, and uses all direct and indirect means necessary to secure the compliance of the masses in labouring to sustain this system.\n\nMarxism makes its arguments based on tendencies, not generalities. No one needs to prove the statements above are universally true or never subject to variation, just to agree these statements are the partial basis of a faithful description of our societies.\n\nOur societies are then readily understood as premised on the relationship between two main classes: the class that owns the means of production, and the class compelled to work for a wage and purchase goods at the profit of the owners. By long convention Marxists term these two classes \"the ruling class\" (or the bourgeoisie) and \"the working class\" (or the proletariat).\n\nMany open questions and alternative concepts remain within the different strains of Marxist analysis. You can do this stuff dialectically, or analytically, or in a revolutionary way, or not. If you are a capitalist, you can use Marxism as a tool to guide your investment and your sophistication of methods to control the behaviour of your workers and customers. \n\nBut the superiority of Marxism is nothing mystical if viewed in this way. Marxist theory just has the decisive benefit of having placed its theory of economic activity in a social and historic conjuncture which, in its broad sweep, can be called \"the capitalist system of production\".\n\nMarxism reasons about what a capitalist system needs to keep itself going, and deduces its political theory of class struggle which we find aligns well with our observations. Marxism also generates other more variable political theories on topics such as the state. This Marxist practice of \"critique of political economy\" allows us to try to predict how a capitalist system may develop or fail. While the results of these predictions have been mixed, they are instructive.\n\nPut briefly, Marxism adds a theory of society and politics to an otherwise conceptually deficient economic theory, rather than just waving these other questions away as approximately irrelevant.\n\nNow we can turn to the competing political theories. In comparison to Marxism, orthodox economics offers and depends upon no theory, or a feeble or false theory, or a theory of politics altogether separate from its economic theory. Consider the typically airy formalities of bourgeois liberalism, with its abstract rights, laws and freedoms.\n\nUnder capitalism, economic, social and political theories tend to emerge to prominence and acceptance by way of their compatibility with the continuation of capitalism. The ruling class tends to organise the production of theories of the system it controls that rationalise its continued control of the system. Most Marxists call such theories \"ruling class ideology\" or similar, and would claim orthodox economics is just such a theory. \n\nMarxist theorisation thrives because it embeds this critical principle within itself with reference to the historical conjuncture. Consequently it examines prevailing theories, including its own, with suspicion. Marxist theories recognise that the production of social and economic theory is itself a species of economic activity, carried out within institutions such as academia, journalism and bourgeois politics. This sector of production therefore tends to be closely controlled by the ruling class, just like the rest. \n\nTo a Marxist, the reproduction of capitalist societies is reciprocally entangled with the production of ruling class ideologies contributing to their reproduction.\n\nOne of the immediate benefits of this Marxist approach is its improved theories of system crisis. Ruling class ideology will tend to deny the systems it rationalises are intrinsically susceptible to crises, despite the ample evidence.\n\nWhen crises do occur within capitalism, ruling class ideology represents selected \"job creators\" and \"captains of industry\" of the ruling class as the proper custodians of economic reconstruction, rationalising bailouts, privatisations, subsidies and other forced transfers of capital overseen by the bourgeois state at such times.\n\nRuling class theories generate political thought which omits or denies the possibility of either revolutionary transformation of the capitalist system of production, or of its catastrophic failure. The observed result is a prevailing political subjectivity within which, as Fredric Jameson famously put it, it is \"easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism\".",

Marxism's superiority is in it being economic (dealing with material conditions) rather than political (dealing with abstract ideas), specifically looking for a political economy, one where the political and economic are integrated. It then bases its conclusions on the tendencies of organizations (as in, a large ruling class has the tendency to use its economic base to justify their interests). The state then in turn justifies this by upholding values (policies) that continue to justify the ruling classes interests (\"protects private property, suppresses political upheaval with its violence, and uses all direct and indirect means necessary to secure the compliance of the masses in labouring to sustain this system\")\n\n2. Marxism has made predictions with mixed results, but they are still important\n\n3. Ideologies are given lee way if depending on to what degree they serve the capitalist mode of production\n\n4.

                            "body": "Pretty much. You've under-emphasised the circuit of capital in the situation, but so did I perhaps.\n\nThe key element of this system of production is that the capitalists own and oligopolise the \"means of production\" (once understood as \"the factories\" but now including much more diffuse things like business relationships and supplier agreements, state approvals, information systems, and more).\n\nThis ownership means capitalists can exploit their employees (the working class) by paying them a wage which is less than their aggregate revenue.\n\nProduction returns a profit to capitalists which is reinvested in the means of production, in workplace and social control, large political donations and sinecures for politicians leaving office, and so on.\n\nMarx called the difference between the wage for labour-power and the economic value of labour-power \"surplus value\" and provides a rather sophisticated analysis of these ideas in CAPITAL.\n\nBecause production is the key to social reproduction in any society (we must collectively produce goods to survive), all social institutions are also then contingent on the power of the ruling class. \n\nAlthough Marx did not provide a fully satisfying theory of the necessary features of the so-called \"bourgeois state\" in his own writings, Marxists since then, most famously Lenin, have theorised these features more thoroughly.\n\nBriefly though, the bourgeois state functions like a \"shared service\" for the capitalist class. Capitalists are not naturally allied to each other in most respects. The capitalist system gives members and allied blocs of the ruling class great incentives to destitute each other and plunder each other's holdings. \n\nThe state therefore becomes the archipelago of institutions within which these ruling class antagonisms can be efficiently worked out, so that control of the overall system can be maintained. Through its police and the law, the state also develops its so-called \"monopoly on violence\" to empower itself to suppress working class dissent on behalf of the ruling class when necessary.\n\nThe bourgeois state usually theorises and represents its activities (for example by the ways in which laws are drafted) with an air of neutrality and fairness. It does this to preserve the illusion that society is a \"free association of owners of private property\", despite the starkly different power of the bourgeoisie and proletariat in determining the social order, and the intimate relations between the state and the ruling class.\n\nIt's rather easy to see where this illusory neutrality fails.\n\nFor example: corporations law tends to inoculate company owners from private criminal liability, and penalties are very light. \n\nAnother example: the economic value of wage theft (systematic underpayment of workers) greatly exceeds the economic value of what the public thinks of as theft (burglary, shoplifting, pickpocketing and mugging, etc).",

Police and prison abolition are not premises of Marxism.\n\nI get your point about the \"monopoly on violence\". It's a common anarchist talking point where it's used slightly differently. I don't love cops, of course, but I was using \"monopoly on violence\" not as a moral judgement, but as a description of the way things tend to be.\n\nThe real point is that in a bourgeois state, the law is framed neutrally, but law enforcement is carried out to protect ruling class interests.\n\nTwo great objectives of the law in a bourgeois state have this kind of dyadic structure:\n\n* The appearance of neutral protection of all private property but the prevailing pattern of the protection of private ownership of the means of production.\n* The appearance of a \"right\" or \"opportunity\" to work, but the prevailing pattern that people who do not hold capital are compelled to work or face social death.\n\nAs a result:\n\n* Property law is enforced more strongly where the interests of capital are at stake, and less strongly where they are not (see the wage theft example above).\n* Prisons are mostly places you go to be \"rehabilitated\" so you can return to work.\n\nOther public goods (for example a \"health\" system or an \"education\" system or an \"aged care\" system, the organs of a \"welfare state\") are also conditioned to the needs of capital.\n\n* The health system helps workers to recover from illness or injury so they can return to work.\n* The education system furnishes workers with skills and knowledge demanded by ruling class interests so they can work more productively.\n* The \"social security\" system acts to smooth out the general discipline enforced by the wage. If you don't work, you can't buy goods or hold social status\u2014but \"social security\" gives you a miserable income sufficient to live in desperation to return to work.\n* A public \"aged care\" system is often little more than a tacit acknowledgement that old people can't work productively, but that just shooting them and piling up the bodies would be met with collective resistance.\n\nIt is reasonable to conclude a few things from this:\n\n* Capitalism is a resilient and adaptable economic system that at minimum provides people who can work productively now, or are seen as likely to work productively in the future, with subsistence, and a life of sorts.\n* If you can't work and don't hold capital, you live on sufferance alone under capitalism. Workers themselves will often be taught to despise you.\n* Under capitalism, all aspects of society, and all thinking about these aspects of society, tend to be reshaped to better meet the demands of capital.",

                                            "body": "Compared to something like a medieval guild system, it is relatively simple for somebody to go into business for themselves in most modern western capitalist societies.  \n\nHowever, that\u2019s a big leap to saying that you simply choose to do it.   You still need to accumulate sufficient resources.  \n\nThat\u2019s where you run into one of the imbalances of power in the capitalist economy.  \n\nLet\u2019s say you had a choice between subsistence farming, and going to the city for a factory job.   If the factory job is too dangerous, or the factory owner is trying to underpay the workers, or the factory has to lay people off, you can still survive as a farmer.  (I\u2019m ignoring the complications of getting laid off just before harvest, when you haven\u2019t had a time to put in or gravity crops, so you\u2019re screwed.)\n\nIn this situation, you could argue that the worker selling their labor and the capitalist buying the labor, have a symmetrical relationship. \n\nBut there is no vacant land that you can just use the farm, nor vacant productive forest where you can gather and hunt to survive. There\u2019s certainly not enough of that if a significant part of the population uses to do that.  \n\nSo what you have are owners on the one hand, who are seeking to maximize profit and will seldom risk losing everything. And you have workers who are looking to maximize profit, but also not starve.  Unions are a scary change to this balance because they make it possible for the owners to incur substantial losses due to strikes, and unions tend to push back on other economizing practices like split shifts and just in time scheduling and zero-hour contracts.  \n\nMost western societies have come to the conclusion that, in order to avoid social unrest and violence, we should give unemployed people at least enough money so they don\u2019t starve. We give them enough money to have shelter, although that\u2019s falling apart in the USA at least.  And again most capitalist-ish societies provide medical care.  The USA is again an outlier with a system that covers children, pregnant women, disabled people, the elderly, veterans, and other specific classes of people, but isn\u2019t universal. \n\nSo just to keep the systems stable, government has to intervene in the form of unemployment, benefits, subsidies, and also workplace regulations like a minimum wage and OSHA.   The letter to provide some protection against workers bidding against each other in a race to the bottom.  \n\nThere is no expectation that people who do the work are going to share in the value of what they produce, but rather only get the amount of value they\u2019re able to bargain for.   This is often justified in the sense that way journeys are not taking a risk.  But they aren\u2019t exactly getting security either.  Fire at will. Zero-hour contracts.  1099 workers.  \n\nSo basically the system, as it set up, means that very few people will reap the benefit of the value of their work. Over time this means that people who have money make more money, while people who labor for their own benefit will on average keep their head above water.  Partly thanks to government rules, built from an alliance of good intentions and self preservation. \n\nThat\u2019s not a great environment to save up and start your own business.   It\u2019s especially pernicious in the USA where leaving your wage job may mean a loss of healthcare benefits, which are then expensive or impossible to obtain privately.   \n\nSome people do it. The system has enough flexibility that it gives us both the illusion of mobility, and also a degree of real mobility for people who are lucky or talented.   Honestly, that\u2019s an important safety valve.   if an ambitious talented person can jump the fence to the ownership side, that\u2019s one less potential ringleader for the \u201cproletariat mob\u201d. \n\nNone of this self sustaining system has to be intentional for it to be constraining.",

A particularly abominable example is that of unwaged chattel slavery in the South, and the subsequent brutal economic deprivation of former slaves during the Reconstruction era.\n\n[BLACK RECONSTRUCTION (linked)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Reconstruction_in_America) by the legendary Marxist-Leninist African-American scholar WEB Du Bois is dense, but superb reading on this topic.\n\nHowever, these contending workers arguably do not belong to different classes, but to different \"fractions\" of the working class. None are owners of the means of production.\n\nOne of the strongest tactics of capital against working class solidarity and political power has been to stratify or separate the working class.\n\nStratification takes many forms, but one of the most widespread is the creation of \"foreman\", \"supervisor\" and \"manager\" roles which give workers individual incentives to comply with the regime of capital, neutralising the development of workers' power in the workplace and in society.\n\nOther kinds of stratification include pay variation based on gender (see the situation pre-1970s), or pay variation based on race (see the situation of expatriate workers during the formation of contemporary Saudi Arabia). It is no exaggeration to suggest that wage strata, sometimes enforced by so-called \"blood quantum laws\", played a decisive role in the historical formation of what people today understand by \"race\" at all.\n\n[TRACES OF HISTORY (linked)](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/64-traces-of-history) by the brilliant Marxist scholar of settler-colonialism, Patrick Wolfe, offers a highly compelling account of how \"race\" has in fact been everywhere differently formed as a social, cultural, legal and above all economic \"technology\", all dependent on the requirements of colonial capital.\n\nFor a more general overview of stratification and separation, the Endnotes piece [\"A history of separation\" (linked)](https://libcom.org/article/history-separation-endnotes-4) is a great resource.\n\nAll these pieces of writing supply an excellent backdrop to the fractures within the political left in the United States in the 1970s, the era of the \"New Left\".\n\nThe New Left period featured the schism of the political left that most obviously precedes today's contention over \"woke\" politics. However, writers such as Selma James had more or less solved these theoretical questions from a Marxist perspective as early as 1972. See for instance [SEX, RACE AND CLASS (linked).](https://files.libcom.org/files/sex-race-class-2012imp.pdf)\n\nMy personal opinion is that the reason many of these debates remain so polarised and contentious is the crisis of method among political organisers of the working class. In short, if the working class started reliably winning its battles, many of these angry debates, including the debates charged with racist nationalism about the economic impacts of migration that currently wrack the global North from the UK to the EU to the USA to Australia, would dissolve.\n\nA Marxist outlook is in fact antithetical to racism, sexism, nationalism, and hatred of all kinds between workers. While Marxism may acknowledge workers have material incentives to struggle against each other, it assigns no moral content to these struggles whatsoever, but makes it clear that all such struggles are caused by the stranglehold of capital on politics and society\u2014which produced the laws and borders for exactly that purpose, to enclose the value of land and resources under its ownership (\"primitive accumulation\"), and to divide workers.\n\nThe ethic of a revolutionary Marxist is not to hate capitalists or to love them. The ethic is simply to defeat capital and seize the means of production for workers, preventing yet another iteration of the madness of \"capitalist reason\".\n\nAs for migration, national borders partition the working class, which leads to continual wage triage in this era of \"globalised\" production. Exploitation of workers in the global South is easily the strongest driver of migration. See this post on [Jason Hickel et al's latest research on the global \"labour deficit\" (linked)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marxism/comments/1efg6nj/the_international_labour_deficitwhat_is_the_angle/) for a good understanding of the current state of affairs.\n\nHope all this helps.",

Not sure that in any other case I would have enough time to read that much text in response to a very simple postulate.\n\nI know nothing about you other than that you made a couple of claims. No worries, anyway.\n\nLet me try to be a bit punchier. You said \"the class struggle has become a fight against immigrants\". Consider the following.\n\nLabour markets are competitive markets.\n\nCompetition between workers (such as residents and migrants) to hold jobs and earn wages is not class struggle.\n\nCapitalists instead pay wages. This is an actual class division. Now consider two kinds of capitalist.\n\n* D: Owners of domestic capital who both take profits and pay wages locally. These support migration of foreign workers into their domestic economic sector to suppress domestic wages.\n* F: Owners of foreign capital who take profits locally but pay wages elsewhere\u2014nett importers of labour, but not workers. These don't care about local migration. They want to suppress wages where they are paid: in other countries.\n\nWhen \"D\" predominates in the bourgeoisie, its influence supports high nett migration regardless of public resistance. This was the situation across the global North post-WWII. There was high migration despite widespread resistance to it by a then powerful labour movement.\n\nHowever, \"F\" has become much more prevalent in the global North since globalisation (see Hickel et al. linked above).\n\nSome results of this shift from \"domestic\" to \"foreign\" interests in global North politics:\n\n* Conflict has arisen over migration between alliances of the ruling class drawn from \"D\", \"F\" and similar types.\n* Fracturing ruling class ideology.\n* Resurfacing historical chauvinism of the \"native\" fraction of each country's working class, egged on by cynical ideological profiteers, vested interests, and influence pedlars.\n* Racist nationalism is back in style.\n* Migration policy and law are now sites of relentless public political debate.\n* Migration is now a \"hot button\" topic at many or most elections.\n* Right wing populist, anti-migrant parties sometimes win elections.\n* Because election results can't end the conflicts of capital on migration, the relation between election results and actual migration policy and law is noticeably severed.\n* Right wing populist election results don't actually bring an end to high nett migration (see Brexit, Trump, etc) or substantially alter migration policy and law.\n* There is increasing right wing \"anti-political\" frustration and resentment.\n\n  \nConclusions:\n\n* Bourgeois politics can never free workers from the impacts of these pitched battles between different kinds of capital. \n* Ruling class conflicts over migration are a result of the varying economic sectors in which different capitalists have to pay wages. They'd all love to import the cheap labour of the global South, but some goods can be produced overseas and some can't.\n\nThese are some of the insights Marxist analysis can provide.",

Perhaps it could have been described, at some point, as an economic theory, like frenology was at one point a scientific theory, but once theories are disproven, to hold on to them is to engage in a religious ideology, which is what Capitalism is now, exclusively.\n\nEngles defined Communism as the doctrine of the liberation of the proletariate. It uses a historical, material analysis of reality in order to draw conclusions. Marxists point out that there is a class dynamic in the society, between the bourgeious and the proletariate, which religious capitalists deny. Already, this makes it the superior system, because it acknowledges reality at it's core.\n\nThis class dynamic is inherently antagonistic. What's good for the worker is bad for the owner, and what's bad for the worker is good for the owner. This antagonism is what Marxists seek to eliminate from the society. You just can't build a civilization if it is constantly at odds with one another.\n\nThe elimination of this dynamic, in Marxism, centers around who controls the means of production. Marx puts forward the Capitalism is actually a highly inefficient system, that is actually quite bad at distributing resources, while a worker controlled economy would be far superior. All the evidence shows this is actually the case.\n\nAnyway, that's a start. Hope you're well.",

I call it \"The Unholy Trinity of the Capitalist Death Cult.\" There are three basic principles that all Capitalists \\*must\\* adhere to. They reinforce each other. Thankfully, like all fundamentalist religions, if you can break one apart, then the other two fall quickly behind. \n\nPillar One: The Worship of Money. \n\nCapitalists worship money as God. They are willing to destroy the air, water, land, and all communities and lives to attain it. The absurdity that money is not only fake, but literally something we create and generate ourselves, is entirely lost on them. They have literally destroyed their own civilization in the ideological pursuit of paper they themselves print. Insanity is a good word to describe this behavior, and \\*all\\* Capitalists are guilty of it. \n\nPillar Two: The Worship of The Self. \n\nCapitalists worship themselves above all else, measuring their worth by how much money they have. Delusional morons like Elon Musk are only taken seriously because they are rich, while intelligent people who are well spoken and researched are ignored because they are not rich. Because Capitalists worship themselves, they treat everyone around them as disposable. They are the main character, and everyone else is just an NPC. This psychopathic lack of empathy, and compassion is a hallmark of the Capitalist Death Cult, and is a requirement to remain a Capitalist. The moment a Capitalist becomes capable of even the most modest empathy possible, their ideology falls apart. This doesn't happen, of course, because their entire ego is interwoven into the idea that their value is exclusively measured by fake dollars they themselves are responsible for printing. They view themselves as Jesus Christ, just without any of the compassion, empathy, kindness, or ability to care for others. \n\nPillar Three: The Worship of Chaos. \n\nOften articulated as \"The Free Market\", worshiping Chaos often means that the Capitalists can handwave away the devistation they create by insisting that it wasn't their responsibility, but rather the \"free market.\" Nevermind that they created the conditions for that devistation; chaos is the perfect scapegoat. It's like watching people build a glass case around a building and then steadily fill it with water, but then blame all the drowned people in the building on some kind of external unknowable force. While Money is the God of Capitalism, what all Capitalists seek to attain, Chaos is the force that moves between them and Money, akin to the Holy Spirit in Christianity. \n\nThese three pillars are what make up The Capitalist Death Cult. Should any of these pillars fall, then the other two fall with them. Given how ideologically weak they are, it's easy to knock them down on paper. Unfortunately, slavers aren't often convinced to free their slaves through rational discourse.",

Communism is the ultimate end goal of Marxism and represents a resolution of class antagonisms via a society that is classless, stateless, and moneyless.\n\nLiberalism and conservatism (as understood in their common interpretations) do not address the fundamental issues at the root of society\u2019s problems: class exploitation.

One common point of agreement among most Marxist thinkers is Lenin\u2019s theory of the state and its role in society as upholding class antagonism. \n\nUnder capitalism, the state serves as a \u201cdictatorship of the bourgeoisie,\u201d meaning the minority of society\u2019s wealthy elites influence the state. Before a step to communism can be made, socialism will need to come first. Socialism is collective ownership of the means of production by the proletariat (the working class). From a state perspective, this would be a \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat,\u201d simply just meaning that the state is controlled by the vast majority of the working class as a whole.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the intent of socialism and communism is to establish a true democracy of the people. A democracy in which every person is enfranchised and represented in society. Socialism is not in and of itself the ending step of this (because the state and its inherently exploitative nature still exists), but it is a transitional step from capitalism with a goal of abolishing class structures through the enfranchisement of the proletariat.\n\nIn terms of the economics, Marx\u2019s Labor Theory of Value goes into the nitty gritty of it. But basically, it explains why capitalism is exploitative to all workers. Due to the need to make profit, capitalists are compelled to pay workers less than the actual final product\u2019s value it is sold for. This difference in worker pay versus value is exploited labor.\n\nNow, there is a lot of misinformation in capitalist society about things like the debt, inflation, etc. And while the Labor Theory of Value is a superior way of understanding what value actually is, Modern Monetary Theory (which is compatible with Marxism, as MMT is a descriptor of how economies function) debunks common myths that capitalists propagate about economics.\n\nTo summarize the broad strokes:\n\n-Libertarian-esque free-market types of capitalism fail to account for the fact that the market will exploit workers even further than under a regulated market due to the inherent incentives capitalism has for profit-making. \n\n-A social democracy/welfare state is better than most other types of capitalism in that it attempts to ameliorate the boom-bust cycles and establish more even conditions via laws and the state. The problem is, it is still a capitalist system. There is still exploitation and any gains the working class has can be withdrawn/repealed/crushed. It\u2019s important to understand that any form of progress we\u2019ve achieved thus far was not due some \u201cgoodness\u201d of our capitalist system; every freedom or good policy we have gotten was fought for relentlessly over years and years by the people. Socialism would serve as that bridge to a true democracy where all people are given a voice and say in how society functions.",

Think about it more like you\u2019re a marriage counselor and want to understand each partner on their own terms. You aren\u2019t taking sides.

This is the quickest route I can think of to gaining a solid understanding of the fundamentals of socialism/communism.\n\nAll together, it\u2019s less than 600 pages of reading, plus maybe 4-5 hours of videos that run about 10-20 minutes each. If you spend a couple hours a week, you can get through it all in a couple of months or so.

While you\u2019re reading these books, watch some youtube videos and listen to some podcasts to break things up. Watch the Marxist Paul videos a couple times through or even a few times, and consider taking some notes (nothing too intense, just enough to make sure you\u2019re understanding the key terms). In any case, here you go:\n\nBOOKS\n\n*Principles of Communism* by Engels (25 pgs)\n\n*Blackshirts & Reds* by Parenti (160 pgs)\n\n*State & Revolution* by Lenin (90 pgs)\n\n*Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism* by Lenin (100 pgs)\n\n*Socialist Reconstruction* by the Party for Socialism and Liberation (180 pgs)\n\nYOUTUBE\n\nSecond Thought has lots of great videos, especially these (I\u2019d recommend watching in this order):\n\n* \u201cSocialism for Absolute Beginners\u201d https://youtu.be/fpKsygbNLT4\n\n* \u201cThe CIA is a Terrorist Organization\u201d https://youtu.be/_2khAmMTAjI\n\n* \u201cWhy You\u2019re Not \u2018Middle Class\u2019\u201d https://youtu.be/Nd7cohTdRAo\n\n* \u201cWhy Social Democracy Isn\u2019t Good Enough\u201d https://youtu.be/TRq3pl17C8M\n\n* \u201cWhy Peaceful Protest Won\u2019t Solve Anything\u201d https://youtu.be/qi5reB97GAs\n\n\u201cSocialism 101\u201d is a series of ~10 min intro videos by Marxist Paul: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0J754r0IteXABJntjBg1YuNsn6jItWXQ\n\nPODCASTS\n\n* Revolutionary Left Radio is a must. Huge catalog of episodes on everything from history to theory to international politics and even spirituality and psychology. Look through them to see what\u2019s interesting to you.\n\n* Red Menace is always fantastic, but there are two specific episodes I\u2019d recommend for now, one on each of the Lenin texts (*State & Revolution* and *Imperialism*). I\u2019d recommend you listen to those episodes before and/or after you read the related text.\n\n* Last, I\u2019d recommend subscribing to The Socialist Program with Brian Becker, and listen to those episodes as they come out (about twice a week).",

Indeed that goal will be thwarted by capitalism even if technology advances to the point that it is possible as those who benefit the most from it will rely on it as a tool to control the masses.",

            "body": "I... would not take it as a political theory **as such**. In my opinion, there are many ways to be a Marxist, but I'd like to point out two that show how people adhere to different dimensions of Marx's theory.\n\nFirst, there are those Marxists that I call orthodox or traditional. They focus on the economics and politics of society. In this case, most problems can be reduced to the discussion between use-value and exchange-value, how surplus is extracted from the workforce and such. This stance is hard to argue against, I'm not going to explain why in detail, but I think it suffices to see how society develops while resources are distributed unequally, in the end it's all a matter of value being robbed out of the workers. In this sense, Marxism shows how capitalism as an economic system survives on the explotation of certain classes. To prove this first stance wrong you have to prove capitalism is good (for most people) and since that cannot be done, Marxism stays as the best alternative interpretation.\n\nSecond, there are those Marxists that go beyond the economic and political slang of the Capital to reflect on the *materialist, historical* and *dialectical* processes of social development. Yes, in a sense, capitalism is a mode of production, of the **material** production of commodities, but you can also interpret capitalism as a particular mode of social reproduction, a system that produces not only commodities, but relations. This involves a more \"philosophical\" understanding of Marxism, not just \"technical\". In this sense, Marxism trascends what could be considered just a \"political theory\" and becomes a \"historical theory\", since it not only argues that it is the mode of production that which gives form to social reality, but a dialectical process where production, cognition, socialization, mobility and more are involved.\n\nI think it mainly as a difference in scope or scale. I usually prefer the second way of interpreting Marxism because it allows to understand how some things that we consider \"new\" or \"liberating\" are in reality just reiterations of previous relations of power. Orthodox Marxists will tend discuss things at a more \"practical\" or \"material\" level, where forming a Union and asking for a raise in your payment are considered practices of resistance. From a historical perspective, the end of capitalism requires many other changes in social cognition, reproduction, transportation, etc. In the end, it is a difference that is born from dialectics, if capitalism is a mode of production  where we produce certain social relations, it's fair to ask about the social relations that led us to the \"production of capitalism\" and what we need to produce another mode of production that is not capitalism. This way of thinking is harder to translate into a concrete political program -it cannot be done in a way since the theory is a way of grasping change and political programs are not that subject to change- but it allows for a deeper understanding of society and a more critical understanding of what is happening.\n\nI'm sorry for any grammatical or ortographic mistakes, English is not my first language. Also, it's just an opinion, I never had a formal introduction to Marxism and my ideas are just the product of my academic and political experience.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

            "body": "Marxism is supposed to be an analytical framework based in empiricism and reason. It is meant to be scientific. \n\nScience is not static. It should change and develop through new observations and improved methods. If you read Darwin you'll learn the basis of modern biology, but you won't know the current state of the science. \n\nYou will find some Marxists who are dogmatic about what Marxism is, and treat certain texts as scripture. That is a common criticism of Lenin's writings (not to discredit his thinking and developments in the field).\n\nMarxism as science has been institutionally suppressed in bourgeois academia. Still, because bourgeois economics is meant to be scientific, it has come to similar conclusions over time.\n\nSome notable things about Marxism and its relation to bourgeois economics. Marx concluded that full employment was impossible under capitalism, which was not generally accepted among bourgeois economists until Keynes. Marx analyzed the boom/bust cycle, the existence of which was sometimes denied in his time. Marx concluded that markets lead to the formation of monopolies, something bourgeois economists sometimes still deny. Marx believed in the tendency for the rate of profit to fall across the boom/bust cycle, not just within a single cycle. This is historically been shown to be wrong, and has been a common attack point against Marxism.\n\nUltimately, though Marxism has had empirically wrong conclusions at times, it has proven to be more right and right faster than bourgeois economics. That can be contested of course, so look into the history of the science of economics and come to your own conclusions.\n\nAn important point about the framework of Marxism and its distinction from bourgeois economics. Marx bases his methodology in material analysis. A person's relationship to material conditions is believed to shape their views and opinions, or at least it does commonly at the level of class. Bourgeois economics often starts with assumptions about human nature, and center the rational actor as the base economic unit. Meanwhile Marx takes the commodity to be the base economic unit under the capitalist mode of production. \n\nA classic argument between the two views is in historiography of the first Crusade. Underdeveloped Northern Europeans established some of the first modern colonies and jump started the trade networks at the heart of modern capitalism. Did they do it because of material conditions, or because of their religious beliefs? The classical Marxist take is that it was purely economic reasons that started the Crusade - the Franks were poor, and downwardly mobile aristocrats sought fortunes outside of Europe. Most current historiography considers this to be incomplete - most participants in the Crusade had explicitly religious rationales, and their actions were largely shaped by their desire to show Christ as the strongest God. Yet, the success of the Crusade, and the establishment of the colonies, is best understood through purely material conditions. Trade may not have been the motive, but it was the almost necessary consequence of their actions once they succeeded, and that trade has had a bigger historical impact than Jerusalem being Latin Christian for a couple of generations. \n\nAnyway, Marxism is an analytical tool to help you view the world in a more empirical and logically consistent way. Engels said that once the scholastics developed nominalism that Marxism was a necessary offshoot. Properly practiced, Marxist thought should be grounded in dialog and discourse, real world evidence, and a willingness to be corrected and change views based on empirical observations.",

There is debate to be had whether Marx\u2019s prediction that steadily declining wages in the working class would push them to revolt against capitalism, but his hallmark theses \u2014 surplus value and economic determinism \u2014 have substantial evidence in their favor. \n\nThe notion of surplus value, derived from David Ricardo\u2019s theory of profit, is an essentially scientific thesis about how populations ensure their survival and inequality originates. It requires one to think in rather abstract terms so I\u2019ll use Ricardo\u2019s original \u201cCorn Model\u201d to explain it.\n\nImagine that there are a number of workers on a corn farm who, in order to do their job, need food not only to survive but to restore their \u201clabor power,\u201d or ability to work. And instead of being paid in money, they are paid in what they work to grow and harvest: corn. Additionally imagine that there a number of hours in the day that can reap enough corn for all the workers to meet their nutritional needs. This amount of hours is the necessary work. But in order for their bosses and consumers to eat, they have to work more hours than necessary for their own survival to harvest enough corn for others. This is the unnecessary work, or surplus value. \n\nEconomic determinism, schematized as a relationship in which the base (economic system) determines the superstructure (culture, social conditions), is a more sociological theory but highly evident in two ways. \n\n1. The division of cities according to income, can be seen by simply driving around residential areas. In some cities the differences in income are more dramatically evident, where you may have a shopping district and high rises next to a very poor neighborhood, but it is in any case clear that residential areas are constructed according to respective income brackets \u2014 and thus the wages paid by capitalists. \n\n2. Schumpeter\u2019s theory of creative destruction, in which the the essence of capitalist society is its rapid technological changes over time. According to this idea, capitalists compete to create new products, eventually outmoding certain models in favor of others (such as Blackberry by Apple). Looking throughout the last 100-150 years, one can see dramatic leaps in technology. While created with stolen labor and causing major environmental damage in the process, there is no denying that capitalist industry has caused major changes in how we navigate the world and communicate.",

My perspective is going to be different from most of the other people in this thread. \n\nTo me, Marx\u2014especially in Capital Vol. 1-3\u2014offers a model for how capitalism functions in its ideal abstract (meaning a sort of averaged-out version of capitalism) that helps us understand the system and why it will continually undermine itself through its own development. \n\nMarx also offers a vision of an alternative society derived from this analysis of the forces undermining capitalism. Rather than his alternative to capitalism growing from some ideal or moral principle, it grows from his analysis of the social forces around him. As a result, Marx will always have a sort of timelessness so long as wage labor, commodity production, and/or private property are the norm. If you are disenchanted with society as it is, then Marx offers a much more robust alternative than holding to an ideal or emulating some far off distant land. \n\nMarx's intellectual project is also incomplete and seeing how different thinkers build off of it is very interesting. \n\nIf you're really interested, I suggest you read about it! I actually think you should hold off on joining any orgs in your area until you know what you want out of an organization. \n\nAs for reading recommendations, you can definitely start with Marx and Engels (I recommend Anti-D\u00fchring by Engels as the best starting point) or you can start with some secondary literature on Marx and Engels to familiarize yourself with them that way (I recommend Michael Heinrich's Introduction to the 3 Volumes of Capital and S\u00f8ren Mau's Mute Compulsion) or you can read some marxist historians to see a method in action (I recommend work by Hobsbaum or Wallerstein as a good start). \n\nIf you have any specific subject youre interested in, I'm always happy to give book recs (or article recs if you want something shorter or podcast recs if you want something a lil easier to start on).",

In that this is not what reality is solely made up of, as quantum theory is now indicating. I don't think this negates Marxist theory though, I believe that theories are naturally progressing. Either way, Marxist philosophy appears to exist.",

            "body": "part of the problem with something like Marxism is that there\u2019s no coherent definition. If anything, Marxism is a loose connection of ideas that originated from Karl Marx, but Marx himself opposed the idea of becoming a \u201cmarxist.\u201d As he somewhat famously declared to his Parisian comrades, \u201cJe ne suis pa un marxiste.\u201d\n\nI found it more helpful to think of it as a jumping off point, especially with regards to some of the other theorists who have built on top of his corpus such as Gramsci, Debord, Zizek, etc.",
