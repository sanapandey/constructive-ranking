Since there can be no talk of an independent ideology formulated by the working masses themselves in the process of their movement, \\[15\\] the only choice is \u2014 either bourgeois or socialist ideology. There is no middle course (for mankind has not created a \u201cthird\u201d ideology, and, moreover, in a society torn by class antagonisms there can never be a non-class or an above-class ideology). Hence, to belittle the socialist ideology in any way, to turn aside from it in the slightest degree means to strengthen bourgeois ideology. There is much talk of spontaneity. But the spontaneous development of the working-class movement leads to its subordination to bourgeois ideology, to its development along the lines of the Credo programme; for the spontaneous working-class movement is trade-unionism, is Nur-Gewerkschaftlerei, and trade unionism means the ideological enslavement of the workers by the bourgeoisie. Hence, our task, the task of Social-Democracy, is to combat spontaneity, to divert the working-class movement from this spontaneous, trade-unionist striving to come under the wing of the bourgeoisie, and to bring it under the wing of revolutionary Social Democracy. The sentence employed by the authors of the Economist letter published in Iskra, No. 12, that the efforts of the most inspired ideologists fail to divert the working-class movement from the path that is determined by the interaction of the material elements and the material environment is therefore tantamount to renouncing socialism. If these authors were capable of fearlessly, consistently, and thoroughly considering what they say, as everyone who enters the arena of literary and public activity should be, there would be nothing left for them but to \u201cfold their useless arms over their empty breasts\u201d and surrender the field of action to the Struves and Prokopoviches, who are dragging the working-class movement \u201calong the line of least resistance\u201d, i.e., along the line of bourgeois trade-unionism, or to the Zubatovs, who are dragging it along the line of clerical and gendarme \u201cideology\u201d.  \n>...

They take part, however, not as workers, but as socialist theoreticians, as Proudhons and Weitlings; in other words, they take part only when they are able, and to the extent that they are able, more or less, to acquire the knowledge of their age and develop that knowledge. But in order that working men may succeed in this more often, every effort must be made to raise the level of the consciousness of the workers in general; it is necessary that the workers do not confine themselves to the artificially restricted limits of \u201cliterature for workers\u201d but that they learn to an increasing degree to master general literature. It would be even truer to say \u201care not confined\u201d, instead of \u201cdo not confine themselves\u201d, because the workers themselves wish to read and do read all that is written for the intelligentsia, and only a few (bad) intellectuals believe that it is enough \u201cfor workers\u201d to be told a few things about factory conditions and to have repeated to them over and over again what has long been known. \u2014Lenin",

It was a great loss to the development of Socialism in Russia (and the world) that he didn't have even a couple more years of overseeing it's development and direction. \n\nI think his dialectical understanding of things would have gone a long way to stopping the more mechanical and economic determinist conception of Socialism that took root under Stalin. \n\nLove these quotes, which broadly speaking I think still hold up to this very day, even with our higher forms of consciousness which have developed across national, ethic, sexual and gender lines in line with material changes to Capitalism and its processes. \n\nIn other words, a mono-conception of 'Workers' vs. 'Capitalists' has given way to a more multiplicitous sense of Self, at least in the West, but this still parallels material changes in post-industrial capitalism as the determining factor in the last instance.",

Also his sassy footnotes are hilarious.\n\nI do prefer the translation and analysis by Lars Lih: [https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/857-lenin-rediscovered](https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/857-lenin-rediscovered)\n\nPart one (pages 0-613) is the history and context of the debates that lead to its writing and publication and part 2 (pages 613-853) is Lih's new translation from Russian. Part one is also on spotify for free: [https://open.spotify.com/episode/20l9731c11lMDKG0hnVmiH?si=bb335e734bc94d52](https://open.spotify.com/episode/20l9731c11lMDKG0hnVmiH?si=bb335e734bc94d52)\n\nHe explains at length any terms or concepts that don't translate 1:1 perfectly to modern english (such as stikhiinost, ie *spontaneity* conceptualized as *elemental* in the adjective form, which is important to how Lenin conceived of consciousness) and it's just really fucking cool to get a handle of how these terms of art were conceptualized by the milieu of the 19th century Russian Social Democratic Labour Party.\n\nHighly recommended.",
