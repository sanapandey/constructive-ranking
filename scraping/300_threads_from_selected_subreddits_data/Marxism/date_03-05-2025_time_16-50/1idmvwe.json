    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nin this video starting from \\~5:53 and going on a few minutes forward, David Harvey refers to a \"technical\" definition of alienation, something he attributes to later Marx. He connects this to exploitation, and the fact that workers do not own the value they produce. I'm wondering how this should be understood. Is this an individualistic point, as in, the individual worker does not own their own input, or is it more in a collectivist sense that \"the workers\" as a class does not own their input.\n\nI also wonder if anyone happens to know a book or article that discusses this technical definition of alienation which Harvey refers to. I'm very interested in this particular way of connecting exploitation to alienation. It seems like a very standard definition, but I'm really interested in some form of standard interpretation of alienation in these lines, specifically related to later Marx.\n\nPs. forgot the link:\n\n[https://youtu.be/01A0prJud-A?t=350](https://youtu.be/01A0prJud-A?t=350)",

            "body": "There isn't really a technical meaning per se, since both are conceptual abstractions, not something you can do like apply Fordism, use mass spectrometry, or turn on a buzzsaw. But the term has two specific meanings, mainly set out in the \"1844 Manuscripts\" but used by Marx and Engels throughout their careers.\n\n1. A social condition - Marx argues in a broader historical sense that workers as a whole are alienated in society. We are estranged from each other because we are isolated individuals competing in the labor force. This account was heavily influenced by Hegel (there's a whole section of Phenomenology of Spirit about the topic). Essentially, it was a theory of modernity. Modern society lacks the harmonious, organic norms that link us together and hold us in community. (Writers like Hegel, Schiller, Winkelmann, etc. were very fixated on the culture of the Greeks, which embodied the organicism they felt we moderns had lost.)\n\nMarx explains this is a material thing, not a cultural or spiritual phenomenon. He explains it neatly in the Grundrisse::\n\n*The general exchange of activities and products, which has become a vital condition for each individual\u2014their mutual interconnection\u2014here appears as something alien to them, autonomous, as a thing. In exchange value, the social connection between persons is transformed into a social relation between things; personal capacity into objective wealth. The less social power the medium of exchange possesses (and at this stage it is still closely bound to the nature of the direct product of labour and the direct needs of the partners in exchange) the greater must be the power of the community which binds the individuals together, the patriarchal relation, the community of antiquity, feudalism, and the guild system (Marx 1993, 157)*\n\n2. An individual experience - Workers \"alienate\" their labor as individual workers. A worker is the owner of their labor power, it's in their bodies, etc. But they contract this power to a capitalist. And they make a commodity that they have no ownership, meaningful connection to, etc., because it belongs to someone else. So it's like an alien force, even though they are doing it: working for someone else, to make something for someone else, almost like their bodies are being possessed by an outside force.\n\nFrom the 1844 Manuscripts:\n\n*\\[T\\]he object which labour produces\u2014labour\u2019s product\u2014confronts it as something alien, as a power independent of the producer. The product of labour is labour which has been embodied in an object, which has become material: it is the objectification of labour. Labour\u2019s realisation is its objectification. Under these economic conditions this realisation of labour appears as loss of realisation for the workers; objectification as loss of the object and bondage to it; appropriation as estrangement, as alienation. (Marx and Engels Collected Works 1975, 3:272)*\n\nHarvey sort of means the second of the two, but he's talking about Capital as a social abstraction, and he says in the video you sent that it has social-political implications.",

            "body": "I am not entirely sure what he refers to, but we have discussed something similar in my reading group, because Marx does use \"alienation\" in a slightly different way later, specifically part four of Capital vol. 3.\n\nFor example, beginning of Chapter 18: The Turnover of Merchant's Capital. Prices:\n\n\"The turnover of industrial capital is a combination of its period of production and time of circulation, and therefore embraces the entire process of production. The turnover of merchant's capital, on the other hand, being in reality nothing but an **alienated** movement of commodity capital, represents only the first phase in the metamorphosis of a commodity, C \u2013 M, as the refluent movement of a specific capital; M \u2013 C, C \u2013 M, is, from the mercantile point of view, the turnover of merchant's capital.\"\n\nAlienation here gets to mean the fact that merchant's capital seemingly operates as an independent force for surplus and profit, while really beeing subordinated the industrial capital cycle - and specifically commodity capital. It looks as if the merchant generates profit from circulation alone, which he certainly does by buying commodites cheap and selling them at higher proces, but with commodites that have already undergone surplus production. The merchant here operates as a sort of profit realizing agent on behalf of the industrial capitalist and the surplus generated in the commodites he sells, but it looks like he is the one creating profit.\n\nBack to Harvey: I imagine that this sort of inter-capital alienation is what Harvey refers to when he explains how the factory system and machine (industrial capital) leads to an increasing level of alienation on both the labour process and the commodity. Sort of to say: the more integrated the industrial capital system becomes, the more it must functionally operate and rely on, f.x merchant's capital, which in turn alienate the whole of the production process more.",
