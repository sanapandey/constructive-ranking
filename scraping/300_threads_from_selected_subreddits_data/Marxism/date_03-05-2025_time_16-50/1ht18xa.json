    "selftext": "I've been trying to read up on paul mattick recently, and particular his and henryk grossman's theory of crisis.\n\nBut I feel very stupid.\n\nHere's why.\n\nI am working from this article: [https://www.marxists.org/subject/left-wing/icc/1934/11/permanent-crisis.htm](https://www.marxists.org/subject/left-wing/icc/1934/11/permanent-crisis.htm)\n\nthat article has a table in it, which idk how to copy over to a reddit post.\n\nAnyways, I can't get the numbers to match, and maybe I am just bad at math? Or is the table wrong? Or am I using the wrong equations?\n\nOk, so working with his assumptions that constant capital grows at 10% per annum, variable capital grows at 5%, that the rate of exploitation is 100% and we start with 200,000 constant and 100,000 variable.\n\nrate of exploitation is s/v. If that's 100% then s = v.\n\nSo our rate of profit for year 1 is s/(c+v)=100,000/(200,000+100,00) = 33.3%\n\nc grows by 10%, so c next year is 220,000 and v by 5% so it is 105,000\n\nOur new rate of profit is therefore 105,000/(220,000+105,000) = 32.3% not 32.6%\n\nThe other rates of profits sort of work.\n\nBut then we have C in year 4. If you do (((200,000\\*1.1)\\*1.1)\\*1.1)) you get 266200 not 266000.\n\nThere's lots of little discrepancies like that in this table. So am I just bad at math or is the table flawed?\n\nI also don't fully get what formula is being used for A%? it was AV/AC which gives you 25% at the start, but quickly dovetails away and downwards rather than upwards like the table states. So what formula is being used there?\n\nCan someone help me work through the math of this table?\n\n  \nI made my own table of what I think it should be here: [https://imgur.com/a/2lC3q08](https://imgur.com/a/2lC3q08)\n\n  \nI included the formulas I used and all that, please help me spot the error if i'm wrong!",
