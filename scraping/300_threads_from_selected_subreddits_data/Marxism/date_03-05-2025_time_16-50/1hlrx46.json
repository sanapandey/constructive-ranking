They aren't racist or malicious, they are seemingly anti authoritarian seemingly anti corporate n banker n anti elite.\nI'm told to forget them if aren't where we are they are intentionally malicious and not just uninformed but i disagree that is the case inherently. \nI feel like they're idealistic n actually counter productive. \n\nIdk n idk enough about how to approach this correctly or if i'm maybe thinking about this incorrectly\n\nI'm not asking how to talk to people about their language I feel like I'm being lectured by the same people who look down their nose at my when I'm working n of I should just disregard them idk\nI feel like materialist analysis should lead people to not conclude people are beyond help or being taught\n\nAny advice would be great n greatly appreciated",

When speaking with people be aspirational. \"Wouldn't it be great if we could set our hours\" or \"the fact we can't set our rates is going to drive us all out of business\".  Bigotry can be cut when it comes up \"hey man, that guy is just trying to do his job like us\". It won't be perfect, it will take time.",

I'm talking about trying to talk to people who at least claim to be on the left, but due to not being informed enough, still Have i guess liberal attitudes pretty much about people being like good or bad. Sorry if I wasn't clear enough",

            "body": "I wouldn\u2019t write them off completely, but a great many of those today, who claim to be anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment are among the most authoritarian and pro-establishment around. Their complaint is not the establishment or the authoritarian cult leaders, but rather that the establishment they have cleaved to in their youth is potentially fading away and the despots who control that establishment are not authoritarian enough in conserving the old establishment. Few of those will be moved by revolutionary categories and movements. \n\nSo you must separate the wheat from the chaff. Some around you can be moved to revolutionary movements. Many others are so steeped in authoritarianism that they will only come along when a new socialist establishment has taken hold. Authoritarianism is strictly conditioned in youth. For those hopelessly authoritarian, they will adhere as blindly to that socialist authority as they adhered to capitalist authority and all of its ugliness. The feeling of belonging the authoritarian personality craves can be satisfied by any authority: A) a malicious and vicious capitalist authority OR B) a beneficent and faithful  socialist authority\u2014of, by, and for the people.  It is the apparent weakness of socialism, for as of now losing to the apparent strength of capitalism that breeds contempt for socialism in the authoritarian personality. When the board game is flipped over, and the socialism becomes strong, and capitalism weak, those with severe authoritarian personalities will be the most loyal socialists.  \n\nThere\u2019s a movie starring John Candy and Tom Hanks, called [_Volunteers_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090274/), where John Candy\u2019s character goes from being a rabid anti-communist to a rabid communist virtually overnight. This is a portrayal of what I describe here. \n\nIn any event, approach all with the same compassionate eagerness to edify. Those hopelessly trapped in authoritarianism (though they cosplay as anti-authoritarian because that is what the despotic authoritarians have commanded them to do) will quickly reveal themselves to you. You can then turn your focus toward those more eager to learn.",

At least most of them. But honestly it doesn't really matter. I'm just trying to get people. Essentially to do like outreach to the working class from like the middle class. I feel like getting that foot in the door for the middle class or members of it. So they start seeing the working class like trump supporting kind of people alice, more human is a beginning of changing their ideas on the world.\u00a0 I just think they still have like some liberal sentiments or ideas currently. They see people like as good or bad but I know that's not how the world works.",

Fromm was a Marxist Psychologist and Talmudic Jew who experienced the rise of Hitler and subsequently fled Nazi Germany because he was both a Marxist and a Jew. He wrote about the authoritarian personality (disorder) in most all of his works. Fromm\u2019s _Escape from Freedom_ and _Art of Loving_ are particularly apt on the topic\u2014elaborating on how fascism took hold in Germany. Fromm influenced others in the Frankfurt School as well but I find him more cogent on the topic and a much clearer writer than the others in the Frankfurt School.",

I specifically organized tent cities full of unhoused folks and they had plenty of reactionary ideas. But when you get people organized toward a common cause, especially if they see results, they often start falling in line of their own accord, as far as polite behaviour goes. Most people do want to be cooperative and courteous if they think it's helping everyone out.",

People who claim to be on the left but think it isn't worth it.\nI understand that by like just by like helping people and being compassionate and empathetic. You can start to chip away at the hostel reactionary like attitude. Makes complete sense to me.\nI'm just trying to think of the best way to like articulate the argument that it is worth trying. To people who don't know enough about organizing or helping people.\u00a0\nPeople who seem to want to organize with trump coming back but I feel like they just want to circle jerk. But I want to try to use that idea to get them involved in actual organizing. So they're not just meeting up with other like-minded. People and drinking like frappuccinos, or whatever",

            "body": "White working-class people you are encountering are MAGA or right-wing populists or sympathizers. The rebelliousness is white populism, critical of the corruption of capitalism but not anticapitalistic. Racism, nationalism, militarism, nativism, anti-intellectualism, anti-feminism, traditionalism makes up their mindset and this belief system mirrors fascism in today's America, they support authoritarians like Trump and Musk.\n\nAmerican liberals, Progressives, the Anti-capitalist Left of all varieties are usually from the Middle Class, are in moral revulsion of racism, sexism, homophobia and xenophobia affecting the white working class today. The gulf in values, education and politics can mean alienation or estrangement between working class people and middle class people. Resentment and anger on the part of the working class versus disdain and patronization on the part of the middle class. In the 1960's it was the Hard Hats, white working class guys who were rightwing against the antiwar middle class New Left young people. The gulf is growing because inequality in America is growing and there is more polarization. \n\nAs you point out the gap must be bridged and more people brought over to a radical critique and transformation of society! How do we do that is a big question that has dogged American activism for 75 years. lol Your thinking and instincts are on the right track. Fascism, the rise of the radical right, the resort to direct monopoly capitalist dictatorship today. The way in which people you meet are retreating into fundamentalism of Christianity, gender, race or nationalism don't represent the STRENGTH of capitalism or America but its CRISIS. Change will come and you are right to try to include everyone in change for the better .",

And they just like hate the democrats because they're like elites. I know that doesn't count for like all Trump. Voters just the ones around me. I'm like in central new york. And like when I talk to them and I explain things to them. It's like a light bulb is going on. You know what I mean, it's like. They just know it instinctively.\nAnd I don't know enough about the anti-war movement but I can't imagine. It was like radical enough that it was trying to like end capitalism and the status quo.\nI tried it use worker co ops. As a way to get in the people's heads that things can be done differently and that we can get rid of like the elites instead of Getting rid of the capitalists just because it's like language. The working class understands better\n\n\nBut I'm hoping that by talking to people that are more middle class who want to organize in the face of Trump. That I can pull them into more revolutionary organizations. So they're not just sitting around huffing their own farts.\n\n\nFrom what I know about like interwar. Europe, it was the middle class. That was the Jack booted thugs for fascism. And that is my concern because, despite being progressive and liberals, they're extremely reactionary.\n\n\nThanks for the help n encouragement I'm still learning but I feel like I got to do something to help n to try to keep my sanity",
