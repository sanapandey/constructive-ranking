    "selftext": "Hello. There is a comrade in a discord I am in who rejects the concept of gender on the ground that humans are an entirely social creature. In reference to Marx's idea that humans cannot principally exist in any sense other than biological without other people. They deny any existence of ones-self in contrast to society as a petite-bourgeois right deviation. They claim, I cannot be a Marxist because I haven't \"interacted with basic Marxist\" texts, as Marxism isn't a choice but rather a field of study.\n\nI think, while he is right that Marx did say that humans exist as parts of society, and you cannot take humans as individuals outside of society, I think its pretty clear that this DOES NOT invalidate the existence of the internal self. Ones external actions, labor, and choices are social, but this is not to say there cannot be an internal existence. \n\nI think its very materially dubious to say that humans do not have an individual, non-social identity. Humans all develop with individual memories and experiences, traumas and unique genes. Our identities develop uniquely, and with great noise, and are not duplicated. How our brains connect within themselves, is unique, and susceptible to harmful calibration and noise. Our existences in coping with disables, death, and illness  in unique circumstances forms unique patterns in all of us. And, how one chooses to express this inner noise, is influence from society, and judged by society, but cannot be entirely said to be a product of society. \n\nThey think this is baseless and a-material, and points back to Marx's statement that we are entirely social creatures. They also use this to reject gender, despite it being a material observable, non-mutating fact, across known society post-proto-communism. Memetically mutating from place to place that these ideas conveniently evolve.",

            "body": "I think both you and your fellow discord person should read some of the works of Leslie Feinberg, a noted Marxist and gender theorist. Gender theory and it's intersection with Marxism has come a long way since Marx, and it would be a bit silly to discuss this as though history stopped after he died. Much more theoretical development has happened since then, a lot of it due to the analysis of the real material conditions of real people.",

What he is missing imo is a psychological basis of understanding. Marx himself was no psychologist, and so many Marxists don't take psychological factors into account. This is why Freudo-Marxism was developed by various thinkers. Freud provides a psychological basis which Marx lacks, and so in some sense completes Marx.\n\nOfc, gender identity is itself socially conditioned. Typically in the west there are two socially accepted genders, although we have been seeing developments of non-binary third gender categories. But so as to not complicate things we can talk about these two main ones of men and women. What is a man and woman is conditioned both biologically and socially, to create a social category. Why do many trans women want to wear dresses and other feminine things? Because they identify with a socially constructed category (woman), and wish to embody that category. Its an *internal* identification with an *externally* constructed category. So its not at all something divorced from social life. Gender identity is only even possible as a product of human existence in a social setting. A lone individual who somehow grew up without any other human contact (a practical impossibility) would have no gender to identify with, no internal gender identity. So gender is the product of man being a social creature.",

            "body": "As a trans Marxist, I think there are clear psychological and biological aspects to gender identity. Slogans like \"gender is just performance\" or \"gender is just social construction\" are deeply alienating for us. If everything was social construction, trans people wouldn't exist and/or we could be changed through conversion therapy. My parents made every possible effort to socialize me male. If gender were nothing but social construction acting upon a tabula rasa I'd just be male, and no one would ever think differently from the political status quo either. It's depressing how people still believe in absolute social construction. Socialist psychologist Erich Fromm says that human beings have a wide adaptability, but we do as s species have certain psychological needs. when we are forced to adjust to situations that run contrary to human needs, our adjustment is maladaptive. His approach is dynamic, not wooden. He is also (correctly) critical of bourgeois psychologists like Freud, and the Freudian Marxists like Adorno and Marcuse.",

            "body": "Further to your point, possibly opening myself up to open fire as someone who studies occult philosophies; this seems very similar to the notion that the true energetic source of which everything is comprised, and united by, is completely and utterly unknowable, but that all forces observed directly or indirectly have become subject to anthropomorphic conceptions, which, again, are themselves society based.\n\nYes, I would agree that any individual's \"inner self\" is a very private and personal affair, but a \"true\" sense of self, as standing apart from society, is ultimately unknowable because we instantly rely on nourishment, care and education from individuals who were fostered within the dominant societal system. We are never not affected by our caregivers who, operate the way they do based on the system they live in. This is a constantly evolving frame of reference that is a purely human experience, as we try best to understand it - via study and critique of our material conditions.\n\nThe struggle for expression of identity wouldn't be a struggle or such a spectacle, if not for the need of the fascists to power their vision with a very specifically narrow and idealised template with a hierarchy of physical and mental traits, purported as the \"norm\".",
