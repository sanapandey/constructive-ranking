    "selftext": "What is the psychology assessment of neo con fascism alt right?\n\nSo most countries have liberal and conservative parties but in the US the conservative party has been moving more to right with the neo con and fascism views. I remember when Bush was in power he was painted has fascism and hard core conservative. But today he would be a liberal compared to Trump and where GOP is today. When you look at Trump and Ron Desantis you see how party has moved more to right.\n\nSo what is driving this move to the right? And why are the politicians more crazy like now and why can\u2019t you have politicians with Trump views but speak like Bush than Trump that speaks like a third grader and more crazy like. Why is it that moving more to the right is losing the ability to speak and more crazy like?\n\nBut now it seems the GOP and conservative people hate Bush now but love Trump. So there is more of shift to right. I would think in 10 to 15 years from now Trump would be very liberal because the GOP would move even more to right than where Trump is today.\n\nIt like the US is being split in middle moving away unless that the news media is doing?\n\nBut I don\u2019t know why every new president the GOP moves more to right, I remember the Bush days and how he was hated and viewed has hard core conservative and now liberals would love for Bush to win over Trump or Ron Desantis.\n\nThere is even some liberals hoping Ron Desantis would win over Trump because of the similar views but he less crazy like and speaks better. But again in 10 to 15 years from now Trump would be very liberal because the GOP would move even more to right than where it is today.\n\nSo has any psychologist or psychiatrist done a psychology assessment of neo con fascism alt right and where the US going down rabbit hole of mental hospital in the way they talk and the way things are going? Moving more to ultra right but talking like kid in third grade. What is causing this?\n\nI mean psychiatrists or psychologists assessment with dumb down effect of the way the person is talking and crazy like not so much politically be it centrist, right, far right or super far right or fascism. What causing the person to speak like a third grader and be crazy like.\n\nUnless you saying fascism speak very strange like and known to be more crazy like in views and beliefs. Than in that case there are some elements of fascism.\n\nTrump was just known to say one thing than the next day say no I did not say that and is also known to talk about military intelligence.  He speaking his mind if he was little boy age 8. Trump was just speaking his mind like little boy not trying act like a polish businesses man or president.\n\nAnd Trump grammar and speaking at third grader level. The problem is the GOP and people that vote for Trump are okay with the dumb down effect now. If this continues in the next 15 years some one will be speaking at first grader level or even worse not be able to speak at all because of the dumbing down effect.\n\nDid Hitler and Mussolini have better speaking abilities?\n\nAlso President Nixon and president Reagan were known for the proxy wars with USSR and hardcore conservative views but had better speaking abilities.\n\nToday President Nixon and president Reagan would be far right conservative but they did not have the crazy views, crazy conspiracy like QAnon, grammar and speaking at a third grader level.\n\n\nUnless this is some about fascism that they have poor thinking and speaking ability and known to be crazy. But again have no idea how Hitler and Mussolini acted compared to Trump.",

They were very weak peace treaties but it was a step towards rapprochement. Trump tore those up, assassinated and Iranian general, put sanctions on China and then really pushed for the peace treaty between Israel and the House of Saudi.\nAnd went to buddy up with Kim Jong Un.\n\nI could make a list of 1000 things Obama fucked up, but it's not like for like.\nI'm English and we have a similar problem because we never had an actual fascist government with uniforms and so on. Like it's completely correct to call out how fascistic our governments are, but it's not a binary. \nThe problem with liberalism is that it's not a defence against fascism and it will go there eventually, but it's not fascism.",

            "body": "This is what Erich Fromm talks about in \"The Fear of Freedom.\" He comments that just as in the early stages of humanity, it was underdeveloped due to a lack of a maturation process, modern man is born with a lack of development that is achieved with age. In terms of humanity, we can say that it is currently in a process of development. Regarding man, in theory, this is reached with his independent life. This mechanism is called the process of individuation. In individuation, a person has greater responsibilities, and also more fears, but it is the control of these fears and the complete autonomy of the individual that strengthens individuation. In the initial moments, the child feels secure with the protection of his mother.\n\nFollowing this logic, we can say that fascists fear the process of individuation that grants greater freedom, although it comes with certain responsibilities, which makes them cling to certain psychological patterns in their leaders that provide them with security and a bond with their nation. For them, subordinating themselves to these types of authoritarian figures gives them satisfaction; moreover, these individuals who subordinate themselves, thanks to the speeches of their leaders, also subordinate third parties, such as ethnic minorities or sexual minorities, which in turn gives them a sense of power\u2014a feeling of empowerment that they would not otherwise experience.",

Service workers are a huge part of the wage workers and tend to have petit Bourgeois tendencies.\n\nSo a large majority of Americans are petit Bourgeoisie and will retaliate against both the greater Bourgeoisie and the Proletariat.\n\nThat is what is going on. The Petit Bourgeoisie doesn't adhere to the old ideals because there is a cultural change going on. Namely, the white middle class is being dethroned by the non-white middle classes and service workers. White middle class hierarchies are being replaced by non-white middle class hierarchies.\n\nAll of it amounts to the petit Bourgeoisie fighting the petit Bourgeoisie. When the petit Bourgeoisie starts to lash out, the crazies come to the top because they are the ones that can appeal to the middle classes even though they advocate things like Fascism.\n\nThis is also why you see things that normally wouldn't happen when the petit Bourgeoisie is stable. Like these companies supporting LGBTQ+ or massive pay raises for wage earners.\n\nAll it really amounts to is various groups of the petit Bourgeoisie trying to win power.",
