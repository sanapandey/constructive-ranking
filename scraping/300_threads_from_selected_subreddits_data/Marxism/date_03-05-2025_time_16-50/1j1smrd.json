You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In a way, materialism traps us in a paradigm of master/slave and can only be overcome by seizing the means of production.\n\nI would disagree here. Materialism is part of the philosophical foundation of Marxism. It's a position on the basic reality of how the world works in general. It's not specific to capitalism. It does not permeate the thought processes of either class. To the contrary, most people think in idealist ways rather than materialist ones. \n\nThe master/slave concept comes from Hegel and informs Marxist analysis but isn't necessarily that fundamental to understandings the basics. Might be better to forget about it here. This idea that people think in terms of master/slave and that this thinking is what causes their oppression--this is precisely an example of idealism, the opposite of materialism. The materialist analysis of capitalist oppression blames the material relations of capitalism (private ownership of the means of production) as the central problem, not mere attitudes or errors of thought.\n\n>Materialism is the cause of caste systems throughout humanity. \n\nAgain here, I wouldn't think of materialism as a cause of anything, but as a principle of correct understanding. The organization of society into classes is material, but it's caused by human beings exercising power over one another.\n\n\"Caste\" is not a fundamental concept in Marxism and can have different meanings. \"Class\" is the fundamental category in Marxist analysis. There is the traditional caste system in India, for example, which is not identical to class although it may be related to it.\n\n>The haves and have nots are all predicated on access to material wealth,and identity politics is like the modern opiate of the masses, as corporate interests will co opt any identity as a means of marketing their products, giving the superficial sense of unity but in reality just serves to further enslave those they pretend to represent. Indeed, it actually causes more division among the lower classes as they fight for representation.\n\nThere I would say you're absolutely on track.\n\n>Capitalism must function on caste systems as a means of doing business.

It wasn't invented, designed or created by Marx and/or marxists.\n\nMarxism is based on materialism because one of its premises is that what happens in the world can be explained, can be derived, exclusively by an analysis of the material world. There's no such thing as a deity or spirit or whatever. \n\nThat said, no, capital isn't \"driven by materialism\" and that doesn't even make sense.",

            "body": "Unfortunately I think your summary here is very flawed. That's OK, this is something to be expected as of course there is a lot of misunderstanding about Marxism in popular culture. So, let's go over a few things.\n\n\"Materialism\" is, I suppose, supposed to be something like greed, not the philosophical theory that only matter exists (which Marx supported). Greed is not the cause of the problems of capitalism, it's a(n insignificant) consequence of the social organisation of production. The problem is that production is carried out by independent enterprises connected by market exchange.\n\nThere are no caste systems in most modern capitalist societies. Caste systems are very specific kinds of social organisation where individuals are restricted from changing their occupations. This is not the case in most capitalist societies. Rather, they are (like pre-capitalist societies since the first slave-owning societies) class societies, where the relations of production create distinct social roles related to the means of production that individuals can occupy, even if there is mobility between classes. Caste societies are a special case of class societies where certain mobility is either legally or customarily barred.\n\nIn a socialist society, goods are no longer produced as commodities, to be traded on the market. Instead they are produced according to a general social plan and directly, socially allocated where they are needed. They are not bought or sold.\n\nProfit is not stolen. See e.g. Marx's marginal notes on A. Wagner. Our criticism of capitalism is not a moral one, particularly since morality is itself determined by the development of society. Capitalism is fair from the standpoint of capitalist morality. The issue is that capitalism is an archaic system that no longer meets human need.",

            "body": "It's not that capitalism must function on caste systems, rather it is the system that emerges from specific historical conditions (private ownership of means of production, commodity exchange, division of labor, technological breakthroughs, etc). Capitalism implies social classes, that is classes that have entirely different relationships to the means of production. Workers and non-workers.\n\nIn a socialist society not necessarily all goods and services are communal. Maybe this is a semantics argument, but this would be generally understood as a higher stage of socialism, or communism. Lower stages of socialism can take different forms depending on the material conditions of the society doing their socialist experiment. You can think of socialism as a workers state, so they will have different near/medium/long term goals and priorities and can have very different policies, including allowing private ownership of means of production, if they conclude that it serves the interest of the masses.",
