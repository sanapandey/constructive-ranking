    "selftext": "I realize there have already been discussions on this and I will absolutely reference those. \n\nFor a while I got a lot of my news from following specific leftist people or accounts that I trusted on instagram since I\u2019d lost faith in most news publications, but obviously that\u2019s not an effective or reliable way to consume news and most of us have done away with Meta anyway post-DEI. Now I mostly read Al Jazeera, Mother Jones, and People\u2019s World. People\u2019s world is clearly a leftist publication so no qualms there, but how to you feel about the first two? I generally trust their reporting but I\u2019m curious to see whether there\u2019s some malpractice I\u2019m not aware of. \n\nIf you have any others you\u2019d recommend I\u2019d love to hear. Thanks!",

It is run by gulf monarchs. \n\nJacobin is ok but heavily editorialized, as is People\u2019s world. \n\nI haven't read mother Jones in probably ten years so I'm not sure there.\n\nNo outlet is going to be good on everything, and a lot of leftist outlets just repackage Twitter as journalism or editorialize local news, which again is not journalism. Liberation news and the workers world paper are the worst in this regard. You want to find outlets with actual journalists, whether they're Marxists or not is way less important.\n\nThese days I mainly read the local trade union paper. I don't have as much time to read the news as I used to. When I was able to read more, I subscribed to a bunch of rss feeds and would just read what interests me. I followed org outlets like La via Campesina, Labor notes, cispes, center for food safety, food and water watch, etc; left outlets like counterpunch, People\u2019s world, civil eats, venezuelanalysis, sustainable pulse, corporate crime reporter, covert action, the final call, mint press, San Francisco Bay view, rethinking schools; national and local news outlets (again, ones with actual journalists, a lot of local news actually just republish right wing garbage from other outlets); and foreign socialist party outlets like ang bayan (Philippines), socialist voice (ireland), tribuna popular (Venezuela communist party), etc",

He will literally spend an hour just giving you the relevant context with which to receive a current event. Oh, the Niger government just told France to fuck off and the US decided to build a 3 billion dollar base there in response? Guess we're going over the entire political history of Niger \ud83e\udd37",

As does Mother Jones, though it's ranked intermediate.  You also may want to check out mronline.org - it's got a long history.",

Might be the heir to Rush Limbaugh?? He expresses much traditional conservative pap like free market absolutism but combined with populist MAGA and the expressed vote of Trump as transactional. Steve Bannon who is really the MAGA thought leader also with a large audience where you can be surprised to hear him call for taxing billionaires, abolishing the federal reserve and massive cuts to defence spending. Also called Elon evil and vowed to keep him out of the Whitehouse. So interesting insights into the diversity of views and inner turmoil in MAGA world across these hosts.",
