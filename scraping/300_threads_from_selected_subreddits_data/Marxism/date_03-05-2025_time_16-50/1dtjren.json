    "selftext": "As someone who is interested in the natural sciences, especially physics, but also Marxist, I wonder if there is any meaningful way a Marxist approach can get a richer understanding of the world than those using different philosophies of science. I've heard and read a lot of criticisms - from Marxists - of Engel's Dialectics of Nature and Anti-D\u00fcring. Is this because nature cannot be said to be dialectical or because Engels was not a scientist and therefore just not good at application?\n\nSurely, there are some reactionary or just plain wrong philosophies that damage the sciences, such as relativism, or even falsification which is flawed. What philosophy, if not dialectical materialism, can a Marxist use as a lens for interpreting the natural world? Science may not revolutionise a society, ie radicalise the proletariat and cause the overthrow of capitalism, but that doesn't mean it won't continue to enrich a proletarian society. In order to do so though, a healthy philosophy is required. So what is it, if not dialectics? (I don't think many Marxists will be arguing against the materialist aspect)",

Check out the [introduction](https://monthlyreview.org/2024/01/01/the-dialectics-of-ecology-an-introduction/) to his newest book. Also his two books, *Marx's Ecology* and *The Return of Nature* trace the intellectual history of materialism throughout Marx and Engels thought and how that has influenced natural sciences in the 19th, 20th, and 21st century. \n\nAnother book to check out is Helena Sheehan's, *Marxism and the Philosophy of Science*.\n\nRichard Levins and Richard Lewontin have two great books on the dialectical nature of biology: *The Dialectical Biologist* and *Biology Under the Influence*. \n\nThese readings may challenge many of the criticisms you have read. Moreover, they provide an interesting insight into the significance of Marxists and the development of scientific thought.",

He worked on a dialectic for understanding the development of humanity's social relations and how it relates to a society's relationship with the natural world - he called it Dialectical Naturalism and it's one of the main pillars of his theory of [Social Ecology](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-social-ecology-and-communalism#toc2). Definitely worth looking into, especially if you want to understand human domination & social development beyond class struggle (which is a huge aspect but not the whole story).\n\nDefinitely going to get some flack from others for suggesting him here, as he's touted as the defining eco-anarchist of the 20th century, but his views on anarchism, Marxism, and methods of organizing changed a lot over his lifetime, and he always had something insightful to say about the status quo of leftist politics throughout his life, even if he has some misses (like \"Listen, Marxist!\" and \"Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism\").",
