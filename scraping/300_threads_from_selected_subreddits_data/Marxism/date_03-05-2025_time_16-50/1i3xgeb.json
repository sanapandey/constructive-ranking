    "selftext": "Feminists (in particular and especially bourgeois feminists) often claim that both men's and women's issues are caused by patriarchy. Patriarchy imposes protective masculinity on men, patriarchy imposes the role of incubator on women. Sometimes it begins to sound as if if tomorrow we carry out voucher privatization of the means of production in favor of women, then everything will change radically.\n\nI am not satisfied with this theory. First of all, I am not satisfied with the fact that it is presented as a scientific fact, although no experiments have been conducted in which the experimenter would abolish patriarchy and everything would change radically for working-class people.  \n  \nIn fact, this theory relies heavily on feminist psychoanalysts' fantasies about the structure of the psyche of powerful men, homophobic men, sexist men. Not on experiments or even on dialectics.\n\nBesides, let's think about it. Under capitalism, there have been several waves of feminism, but a man in stockings and high heels is still more hated than he was under feudalism.\n\nWhen you think about it, the question arises: maybe it's not about patriarchy at all?\n\nIn my opinion, it's about capitalism and especially imperialism. The fact is that the imperialist bourgeoisie, regardless of its gender identity, needs cannon fodder to protect imperialist investments, and to reproduce both the labour force and the cannon fodder. And this is largely what the abortion ban is connected with, and not the fact that the anti-abortion powerful collectives is largely made up of men. And this is what the imposition of protective masculinity on men is connected with. A working-class man must dress and act like potential cannon fodder, ready for the bourgeois state to send him to protect imperialist investments.\n\nThat's why I don't believe in the bourgeois feminist theory that if you increase the representation of women in power structures, everything will change. No, it will not change - if the imperialist system is preserved.",

The capitalist version is a weird mutation, like in rich countries the family is a little block isolated from the community, that's capitalist, but patriarchy isn't.\n\nThis is going from things that I remember reading not in depth study, but there is a big shift as agriculture takes over from nomad societies, and at that point in many cultures there idea of God or gods turn from women into men, I think that is the origin.",

I've heard of this narrative as an explanation behind the anti-abortion rhetoric of capitalists but it seems like a bit of a stretch imho.\n\nBesides, imperialism and patriarchy are not mutually exclusive. If anything, Marxist feminists often describe patriarchy as \"male imperialism\" given the similar domineering structure.\n\nAs for the Musk-loving incels ranting about \"we need more children for capitalism\", I think that's a relatively new phenomena that emerged out of a panic regarding sub-replacement birthrates.",

It doesn't take much work to look at the state of womens rights across the globe and through history.\n\nGuess why \"men in stockings\" are hated?

Trans women don't perform the main function they expect cis women to do which is to birth a child and take care of children. It's sexist stereotypes all around but I really don't think these are necessarily unique to capitalism, just accentuated. Even current tribes have different roles for the sexes. Shit sucks. That being said when it comes to dominance in societies, men generally seem to be put at the top.\nI fully agree that putting women I charge of a capitalistic society won't change a damn thing.",
