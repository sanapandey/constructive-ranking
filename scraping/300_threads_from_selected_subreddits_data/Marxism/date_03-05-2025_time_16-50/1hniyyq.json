Perhaps I can help you with these questions.\n\nWell, Brazil and Argentina were, respectively, colonies of Portugal and Spain until the early 19th century. After gaining independence, they continued to be exporters of raw materials. Both countries made attempts to industrialize, especially around the mid-20th century. However, they lacked sufficient internal capital and had to rely on foreign currency loans, which turned out to be a bad deal in the long run.\n\nIn short, these are countries with high poverty rates due to their colonial past and low industrialization. Their limited economic complexity is also one of the factors that explain the high levels of social inequality, as argued by [this Brazilian economist](https://www.contrapontoeditora.com.br/produto.php?id=10012&srsltid=AfmBOopFL7Z4j7oQRnNBDeW2hUdryN-6FcQPHqsaeyy6g9Bh8mZoslBC).\n\nI\u2019m not very familiar with the intricacies of Argentine corruption, so I\u2019ll limit myself to speaking about my own country.\n\nHere in Brazil, we have a very [influential sociologist](https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/188082/mod_resource/content/1/Raizes_do_Brasil.pdf) who, in the 1930s, argued that patrimonialism\u2014a Portuguese legacy\u2014was a key element of Brazil's political culture. According to this sociologist, patrimonialism makes it difficult for us Brazilians to separate the public from the private. As a result, we often use the state as a means to achieve personal goals.\n\nThe patrimonialism thesis has been widely contested, particularly by [this other sociologist](https://sextante.com.br/livros/a-elite-do-atraso/). However, it still holds some influence in certain intellectual circles in Brazil.\n\nI hope this was helpful. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.",

Through colonial plunder and rape, the west became wealthy, and later on, Capitalism developed there first. Capitalism unleashed untold productivity in Europe, and, made Europe even more wealthy.\n\nThis wealth derived from the workers in Europe, allowed the bourgeoisie of Europe to live in extravagant wealth; however, by the 1900s, the workers of Europe started to become less exploited, due to organized action, concessions from the bourgeoisie were given to Europeans bit by bit.  This exploitation was picked up by the colonies, as, the imperialist powers worked to impose capitalist development and exploitation upon them.\n\n> The class of those who own nothing but do not labor either is incapable of overthrowing the exploiters. Only the proletarian class, which maintains the whole of society, has the power to bring about a successful social revolution. And now we see that, as the result of a far-reaching colonial policy, the European proletariat has partly reached a situation where it is not its work that maintains the whole of society but that of the people of the colonies who are practically enslaved. The British bourgeoisie, for example, derives more profit from the many milllions of the population of India and other colonies than from the British workers. In certain countries these circumstances create the material and economic basis for infecting the proletariat of one country or another with colonial chauvinism. \n\n- Lenin, 1907 \n \nThe social protections and surplus value granted to the Europeans, in the form of increased wages, and complex social security nets, forms the \"Labor Aristocracy.\"\n\nSouth America never got any of this. South America remains a land of super exploited workers, the salt of the earth the wealth of America, Europe, and (increasingly) China is built off of.",

Modern Imperialism, as Lenin Describes in his work \"Imperialism: The Highest Stage Of Capitalism\" began soon after.\n\nSo we need to understand recent European development. Europe, circa 1960, was split in 3 ways. You had the Western Bloc, from Sweden To Portugal. These countries agreed to divvy up the plunders of the new US imperialist order, after WWII. And also, the wealth from the imperialist position of the US and the West allowed for favorable trade with the countries which never had large colonies. The countries in category include: Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, and Spain. Spain having had large colonies, was an economic backwater by the 1900s, revitalized by the Marshall plan.\n\n**The whole reason for this, was because of the USSR**. The USSR gave a stellar example of what the workers could do, should they band together. So, where the working class were too strong, class war was seen as something to dismantle. So, even countries like Sweden and Iceland, needed concessions, and needed to improve their quality of life hire than the USSR, to prevent a revolution.\n\nThe outliers here are Portugal, Norway, and Ireland. Portugal, being one the poorest countries in Europe, to this day. Only slightly benefiting from the EU, but the EU mostly acts as an extractor of young Portuguese people, as cheap labor.\n\nIreland, never became wealthy until the 1970s when it became a tax haven. To this day, Ireland remains under the developed, with no train infrastructure, and no large scale industry.\n\nNorway found oil. \n\nThe Eastern Bloc were developed under the Soviet Union. Prior to WWII, they were under developed compared to the west, more developed than the colonies. This  is because, they were part of European kingdoms, or independent, free to develop their own economies, until the age of Imperialism. Under the USSR, they were able to become very developed compared to the west. Only recently, has the Eastern Bloc countries started to become backwaters again.\n\n\nThe third way, the Balkans, Yugoslavia and its spear of influence. They played both sides, and were independent. This allowed them to develop in peace. \n\nThe last side, the 4th side: Finland and Switzerland we able to be developed because they were neutral. Switzerland had a more bourgeois  character, a place for money laundering like Ireland became. But, Finland, was a neutral countries completely. The strong labor unions and soviet proximity made it very possible for a revolution at any moment. So, like the west, to prevent revolution, they had to give concessions to the proletariat",
