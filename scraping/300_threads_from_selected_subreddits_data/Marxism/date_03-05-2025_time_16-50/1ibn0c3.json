    "selftext": "I really liked Chomsky and Herman's \"Manufacturing Consent\". It changed the way I think about foreign policy and mainstream media.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for books that cover US History / World History from alternative-to-the-mainstream perspectives --- preferably from the marxist perspective? I am not a well read student of history; I would like to learn more about working class struggles and the problems caused by imperialism without accidentally indoctrinating myself with bourgeois narratives. \n\nA couple of other books in a similar vein I have read are \"Oil!\" And \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair, as well as \"Homage to Catalonia\" by George Orwell, and \"You Cant Be Neutral On A Moving Train\" by Howard Zinn. Speaking of Zinn, I considered reading \"A People's History of The United States\", but someone told me it was outdated / irrelevant and not worth reading these days, so I moved it down my priority list. Should I give it a shot?\n\n",

A people's history of the world was mentioned here, but I've also found a people's history of science by Clifford Conner and A people's history of the civil war by David Williams are both great. the study of history is as important as the study of theory, and I'd even say the two are extensions of the same school. Economics, philosophy, history, they're all connected.",

On the contrary, it gets to the heart of American politics as the long quest of the ruling class to create some kind of social stake for white Anglos at the expense of others. For example, a huge reason native Americans groups were a threat to the social order, not only an object of conquest, was the high number of whites going native.\n\nAnd Parenti\u2019s *Inventing Reality* is the superior book to Chomsky\u2019s.",

(This conversation took place while I was still in highschool.)\n\nWhile not a marxist, the person I talked to had alot of respect for Zinn, and I very often took this person's opinions at face-value. Looking back, Im not sure how familiar the person was with Zinn's work, so Im not sure really what the basis of their claim was. \n\nThanks for the little taste there; it definitely piqued my interest.",

Because they don't read leftist texts and just regurgitate similar talking points they heard from other conservatives. They say things like this to discount leftist books in a non-ideological way, so you don't realize they're discouraging you purely for ulterior motives. They simply know it's a popular book, and believe American schools are leftist indoctrination (lol), and put two and two together without knowing what they're talking about",

Simulacra and Simulation sounds cool, might read it once i get through the two i already have access to.\n\nAlso, my big theory goal right now is Deleuze; not sure what most marxists think about him.
