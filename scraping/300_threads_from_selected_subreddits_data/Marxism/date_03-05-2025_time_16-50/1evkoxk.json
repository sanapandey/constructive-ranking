    "selftext": "Okay so this is very strange and odd the Conservative Party is extremely rooted with Christianity. Lots of the Conservatives in the Deep South and Midwest are very religious.Lots of congressman and senators are evangels in the Deep South and Midwest.\n\nSo my question is how did Conservative Party get so removed from the Christianity?\n\nAnd yet in the US, the policies of the far left arguably align better with the tenets of Christianity. Helping the weak, feeding the hungry, helping the poor and homeless healing the sick and universal healthcare and dealing evils of capitalism.\n\nSo what happen to the Conservative Party? How did it get like this so removed from these things?",

They brought bags of money to prominent preachers to have them say Jesus was cool with the rich. Zero pushback. Prosperity Gospel, megachurches and the whole nine were born.\n\nThis is not the whole story, as Christianity has many different sects.",

This all goes back to the radicalist Puritan years of the American colony. Conservatives use that to reinforce their brand of conservativism with their own brand of Christianity.",

You have a point about far right Catholics in Poland, but its not right to paint the entire Church and its members with the same brush.",

All religions exist largely to serve the ruling class, and in that sense right wing Christianity is exactly the same as it's always been. What's  different is modern Christianity is a distortion of Christianity that was adapted to fit in the feudal superstructure, Christianity can't really evolve organically in the same way because there isn't a social basis for it anymore, it's only persevered as a means for the ruling class to manipulate the masses. So what we end up with is this extremely cynical distortion of Christianity where the contradictions turn antagonistic, which in a religious context largely just comes across to most people as hypocrisy",
