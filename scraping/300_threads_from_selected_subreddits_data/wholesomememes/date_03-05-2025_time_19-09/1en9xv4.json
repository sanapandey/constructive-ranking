You only need to stir your pasta for the first 2-3 minutes it\u2019s in the water. The starch in the pasta is the reason it binds to itself, and introducing dried noodles to boiling water causes them to release their starch, so if you stir vigorously for the first two minutes the pasta is boiling and the starch is released, it will no longer bind to itself even without stirring. Well salted water is important to avoid binding, but mostly just essential for tasty pasta! A small amount of olive oil (in european dishes, or an appropriate oil for the cuisine you are preparing) in the water will also improve the flavor and help lubricate your tasty noodles.",
