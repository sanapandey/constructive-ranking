I'll point out again, I don't imagine anyone else is cooking while her perch is there - maybe I'm wrong, but that seems like a lot for 1 person if it gets busy, especially someone having to slide themselves back and forth across the perch, which looks exhausting to have to do.\n\nThis girl is amazing and I truly hope she is being cared for properly and not simply getting her base legal requirements met.
