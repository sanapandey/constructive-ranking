It was three in the morning, the middle of summer, and on the outskirts of downtown Philly. I put on some sandals and took her down several flights to the sidewalk. The streets were empty and it was nice and quiet. \n\nBefore I knew it, a group of about fifteen African American teenagers had silently rolled up on me and stopped. They looked like they meant business (and I had been jumped by a similar gang a few weeks prior) and I was standing there like a goon in my PJs and sandals with a little dog. No one moved or spoke for an about five seconds and my mind raced the whole time. (\u201cWhen do I grab the dog and just run?\u201d \u201cWhere would I even go?!\u201d) \n\nAfter what felt like forever, one of them looked up at me and no emotion, said, \n\n\u201cThat your dog?\u201d\n\nI gulped. \u201cUh, yeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure is cute. Can we pet her?\u201d\n\nFuck yeah you can, kids! Bless your little hearts!",
