As opposed to if you put it in a playlist you won\u2019t ever get bored of it or at least much less quickly. It also makes getting your favorite song a much better feeling because its rarer. If you had your favorite food every day, it would be enjoyable for a while but it would become stale (metaphorically) after some time and you\u2019d want something else for once. If you had it sometimes, you\u2019d enjoy that food alot more on the occasions you had it and probably never get tired of it. I don\u2019t know if that made sense or not just my thought process",
