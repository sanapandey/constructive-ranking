    "selftext": "Hey friendos! \n\nThe best way for us to take back our community from spam and bots is to be very selective of the content we allow here. \n\nHere are the main things we are looking for:\n\n* Is it wholesome?\n   * Uplifting, life-affirming, kind.\n   * This is subjective at the discretion of moderators. \n* Is it a meme?\n   * A meme is an image or video/gif with text included in or on the image.\n   * Screenshots of social media or news are not memes.\n   * OC Comics are allowed as long as they are wholesome.\n* Is it original content (OC)?\n   * If you did not personally make the meme, do not post it!\n   * Edited comics are also allowed as long as you are the one that edited it.\n   * No reposts are allowed! It doesn\u2019t matter if it has not been posted in the community before. If you did not make it, it is considered a repost. The only exception being that you personally made a meme and did not share it in our community EVER. We only want original content.\n\nPlease be sure to read all of our rules on the sidebar. Make sure that your comments are wholesome too as we do not tolerate hatred or bigotry of any kind. If you see a post or comment that breaks our rules, please report it so mods can take action. All posts for the time being will need to be approved by a moderator, so please allow up to a 24 hours for us approve your meme or follow up with any reports. Moderators are humans too, so if we make a mistake or if you have any feedback, please send us a modmail so we can take action.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/njde91t5u1md1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31d6937c22f7c26a0b3ddb1edcda44deaf3001ab",

This is the first effort I have seen on this website where moderators are taking it back. Very impressive effort and thank you for making it instead of letting another community die to bots.\n\nSeriously. Thanks.",
