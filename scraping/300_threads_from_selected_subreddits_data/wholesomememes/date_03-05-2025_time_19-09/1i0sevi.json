But I'd tell her \"I don't care if it's 3AM and if I have to bring you to the hospital or if you're just not sure if you drank too much or not - there is nothing too big or too small\" - I hope she believed me and that she never really had to call more than that 1 time.",

She called me about 2am crying because she had an argument with this dude and the absolute scumbag piece of shit put his cigarette out on her face. She had walked out after and was stranded in bumfuck NJ. Luckily I had not been drinking that night because I drove us to a warehouse party so I rounded up 4 of my friends including 2 FNDY firefighters and a 6'6\" merchant marine/MMA fighter. Booked it through Manhattan and found her at a gas station in NJ. She didn't want to escalate things but we came to fuck and made her tell us where this party was. Probably the most satisfying moment of my life when we rolled up to that shitty trailer house. Grabbed this fucking guy by his hair and dragged him into the front yard. My friends held his friends back while I kicked his face in. Knocked out 4 teeth and left him bleeding in the grass. Since then my sister has been happily married to a wonderful unrelated firefighter and that dude is in prison for aggravated dui.",

But the simple fact of the matter is it doesn't matter what women do, there are going to be men anywhere they go that may end up harassing them.  Like I said in my previous comment, in the video I referenced the woman was simply walking through a parking lot.  Are you going to make the argument that maybe women shouldn't be walking through parking lots or something?  Just because it *should* be safe to do certain activities, sadly that doesn't mean it actually *is*.\n\nI can approve of the mentality of teaching people how to avoid conflicts, and not starting group fights.  I appreciate as well the fact that you are advising people to call the cops if there is a problem.  But it is also a fact that police take time to get to the site of conflict, during which the perpetrators could seriously hurt someone, or take off before they get arrested.\n\nAlso, 'how to not get into these situations in the first place'?  A good way to do that is to travel with a man, or a group of men (i.e., the brother(s) this post is about in the first place).  The more intimidating your group looks, the less likely you are to get harassed in the first place.",
