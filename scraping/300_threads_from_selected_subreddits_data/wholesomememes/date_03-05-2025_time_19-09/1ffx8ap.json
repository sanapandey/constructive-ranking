Your thoughts don\u2019t have to control anything about you unless you give them that power.

Meditating has helped me a lot but I\u2019m definitely still nowhere near half-way decent at it \ud83d\ude02. Watching my thoughts throughout the day without judgement does feel good though :). The more I do it the more I notice that things I used to consider bad thoughts don\u2019t have the same affects on me anymore",

It felt like a struggle just to watch my thoughts (which sounds like it should be easy but it isn\u2019t). Even now I still struggle. Try focusing on other things at first like your breath or your heart rate (which will surely be pounding through your chest if your experience is like mine and it sounds like it is) or the sound of the fan or the feel of your body on the sit beneath you. Definitely not an easy task but I guess you can either blow your mental instability off as a condition or you can work to accept it and move past it",
