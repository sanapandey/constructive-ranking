But was catastrophically self destructive as an adult.\n\n And the more it failed, the harder I was reproducing it again since, after all, I had learned as a child that was supposed to work and help.\n\nHowever, that \"scheme\" being 100% unconscious, until the shrink showed it to me and explained it to me, I had no idea I had that self destructive behaviour slash protection reflex in me.\n\nUnderstanding how my inner cogs clicked together was really fascinating. And I learnt to recognize the signs I was starting to reproduce that scheme, and stop at once. \n\nAll that to say, it's worth it. Better spend some money, if you can afford, info a shrink, rather than restaurants and stuff. In the long term, you'll experience more inner peace and happiness.",
