It has taken years to find people that actually care and don\u2019t just want to throw a prescription at me. I just want to see one person to get the help I need, or at least one office, but that\u2019s just not how it works. That in itself is enough to discourage a sane and healthy person from seeking help. Add mental health issues or even crisis and it almost becomes impossible to manage.
