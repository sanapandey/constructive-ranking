Birthdays and Christmases too, \u00a3150 each, for all three of us. That\u2019s \u00a3900 a year on just birthday and Christmas money they were giving us, year after year. When my older brother went to university, my grandad gave him \u00a32000 towards it every year, that\u2019s another \u00a36000. He did the same for me when I went to university last year and intended to do so for the remainder of my course.\n\nGrandad died in February, and fuck it broke me man. That funeral was something else. After things had settled down a bit, my dad let me know that in his will, he\u2019d made it known to continue paying \u00a32000 to me for each year of university, and to my little brother too if he went. We also learned that as part of his inheritance, he wanted to leave each of us \u00a315,000. Even now, from the grave, he\u2019s looking out for us and spoiling us rotten.\n\nGrandma hasn\u2019t been the same since, just gone into hospital for a broken hip after a fall. She\u2019s so small and frail these days, she\u2019s losing her mind slowly and it\u2019s so sad to see. I went and visited her the other day and she tried to slip me \u00a360 again, \u00a320 to split between my brothers and myself, just like she used to. I couldn\u2019t accept it this time. Losing grandad showed me that I\u2019d give it all back just to see him and her happy and healthy again.\n\nI love you grandma and grandad xxx",
