A random stranger had reached out to me via dms. He volunteered to listen to my problems when not a single soul in my rl would care. \n\nThat gave me the courage to talk to my brother. Came out to him and to my surprise, he was very supportive and has been supporting me ever since. He told me to go find communities for people like me in our city which i did and met some incredible people and befriend them. We've grown extremely close now over a few drunken nights and video calling every week. Now i don't care if our parents ever support me or not. i have at least my brother who believes in me.\n\nAm also now gonna apply for phd this year and leave this house (my mom's control) and city. \n\nIt's all bcuz 1 kind stranger decided to listen to my desperate pleas and not give up on me. Just, please don't give up on me, that's all i ask.",

So talking to me in English for a couple days apparently made a big difference for him and the way he felt about his English skills. And now he\u2019s got a new job with a big well known company and his whole world has changed. I don\u2019t really feel I did anything except be myself, but for him it was something more than that.
