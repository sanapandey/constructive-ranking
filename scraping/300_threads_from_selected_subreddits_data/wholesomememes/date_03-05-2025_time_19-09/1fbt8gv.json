(there are bot networks using established accounts with years of regular activity and lots of karma, so while it\u2019s right to be suspicious of new accounts they\u2019re far from always bots or trolls). \n\nBot accounts rarely interact with people on their posts. But there are also bots that farm karma in the comments. They usually have triggers (like when someone says a certain thing it triggers the bot to follow up with a comment) and use common phrases (This/Repost/Everyone likes this and other  stuff you regularly see in threads on Reddit, but again, normal people use these phrases too).\n\nSo to get within reasonable doubt you\u2019d have to look for clusters of evidence by going through their profile and history. \n\nOf course bot makers are growing increasingly aware of how we detect them and develop further layers to escape detection. I\u2019m probably not aware of every method out there any longer due to how quickly they can gather feedback and adapt. Plus, most people don\u2019t care about looking into whether someone is a bot or not so even if they\u2019re detected they\u2019re still effective. A banned bot is just the cost of doing business to these people.",

The post is trying to claim that moderators and redditors are working together to fight back against that. \n\nWhich is funny because the majority of reddits traffic has been bots for quite awhile, most notably after Spez made changes to the api tools and fucked over mods HAAARD. \n\nAnd since he\u2019s wanting to drive up the value of Reddit they can\u2019t really get rid of all the bots because then it will become painfully obvious how little genuinely original content there is to it now. \n\nPeople that have been on Reddit for a few years will be able to tell you that the front page was a pretty steady stream of content. It would be refreshed with loads of new stuff every few hours. \n\nNow you can see the same posts staying in place for the day, if not two, unless something big happens. \n\nThe vast glut of organic users have left. Some subs are trying to fight back against the bots ( this one for instance ) but it\u2019s trying to bail out the titanic one thimble at a time.",
