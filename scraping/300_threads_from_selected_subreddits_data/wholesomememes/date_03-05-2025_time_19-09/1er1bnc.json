If billy even senses that this kind of foul play is happening, you can be sure that they change the tactic. \n\nI know how much planning and consideration these artist and organisers put into the tours they do, especially for the very big ones. They send out people weeks ahead of time to sort shit and sense the pulse, organise promotions and such. The only thing beyond their control, tends to be the ticket sales - as the venue handles that, the tour just rents the venue for the duration of the show.

They ride with him to the hospital where they find out the man was not drunk, he had a heart attack behind the wheel, and he would not have survived if it wasn\u2019t for the 4 friends. They acted so selflessly that the ambulance driver offers to take them to the concert and turns on the sirens so they can get there as soon as possible. Finally they arrive and are able to take their front row seats. Unbeknownst to the group, one friend was dying of cancer. He had only a few months left to live. He had been incredibly depressed but the chance to see Billy Joel live with his best friends was the one thing he wanted to do before he died.

I had bought tickets a few hours before the show that was almost sold out, so they were up in the very top, back row of a huge arena.  My friend and I got to the show kind of early and were sitting in our seats when a little kid in a full western outfit came up to us and offered us two free front row seats.  I didn't believe him and told him to get lost, he turned and waved his mom over to us, she came up and showed us her family back stage passed and said her husband was the lead guitarist, and that Garth gives the band's family the front couple rows of tickets to give to people who look like they could use them. \n\nSo we took them and went down to the floor section up front, were greeted by Garth's parents who were super nice, and they showed us to our seats:  Row 1, seats 1 and 2.  We couldn't believe our luck, and while we waited for the show to start, more people were brought to the front 2 rows by his parents.  The ones around us asked \"hey, did a little kid in a cowboy outfit give you tickets too?\" It was really awesome, an amazing experience.  I had my  camera with me and got some great shots during the show, but unfortunately also got some major hearing loss from being so close to the speakers.  I couldn't hear right for about a month after the show, and other problems still persist to this day.",
