Drain and just let them sit for a bit and let some of that excess moisture evaporate. Heat up your butter with some heavy cream, maybe some herbs thyme, rosemary, bay leaf etc. Mash em or use a ricer, and add your heavy cream/butter liquid until you get the right consistency. Add salt if needed, put whatever other random shit you want to put in there. Best potatoes for mashed are probably Yukons or Idaho, reds are okay but can get gummy if overworked.\n\nI'm not knocking the method, baking them works just as well.
