At first I was very saddened by it because I thought that it was my fault. But it was not anyone's fault. She tried to help me the way she could, but it was not the help I needed. My actual psychologist has helped me a lot and I am thankful because I was tempted to think that psychology was not able to help me but I was wrong \ud83e\udd79 I prefer to think that you may be wrong, too \ud83e\udd79\n\n![gif](giphy|3oEdv4hwWTzBhWvaU0)",

You're not alone. And this means you should be able to rely on someone else, may be even just for preventing you from giving up. I'm sorry if I have given you the impression I wanted to heal/save you. I have never thought of that. One year ago I would have tried my best to become useful to you, support you and make you understand how important you are. But now I have understood that I cannot do this thing.
