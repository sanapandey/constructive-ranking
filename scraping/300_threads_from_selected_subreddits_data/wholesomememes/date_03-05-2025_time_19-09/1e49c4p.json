A lot of well intentioned people plant non-natives or plant trees heavily in biomes they don't belong in great amounts. And it's hard to blame them when they're told all the time to plant trees and flowers all the time without being told the specifics.\n\nmany areas of the US for example are overplanted where there should be meadows, prairies, wetlands, deserts (both cold and warm) etc. So a lot of conservationalist then have to go in and cut down those trees and root out the non-natives trees too.\n\nthere's plenty of native plants that can help reduce the heat of an area even without shade! Plants absorb heat, reducing surface temperatures way more than most man-made surfaces that usually just reflect heat. Even just having ground cover is enough to make a huge difference. Just gotta do some research on what plants you can get that work for your area for what needs you need it for.",

Thats not a few hours of pruning and weeding amd edging the whole yard. Thats just cutting the grass. Theyre huge. \n\nThe grass is also generally not the best option for the local wildlife. Often they are poorly built and planned. Bad drainage. Leads to things like flooding and/droughts. \n\nAnd they take huge amounts of water to keep them alive.\n\nPlus, why we are here: few to no trees. So, less shade, more heating. Less water retention again. Less soil retention. Again, worse for wildlife. \n\nAnd there are millions of them. 10s of millions. And we havent even gotten to even bigger rich people lawns. Where it takes someone on a riding mower all day to cut just the grass. Millions more of this size. \n\nPlus all the industry it takes to make these things happen. Just the gas mowers and trimmers that are still out there chugging along every warm day. The landscape company trucks driving all those mowers around.",

And what's the biggest driver of deforestation?\n\n[Over the last 10,000 years the world has lost one-third of its forests.](https://ourworldindata.org/world-lost-one-third-forests)\n\n*An area twice the size of the United States. Half occurred in the last century. In just over 100 years the world lost as much forest as it had in the previous 9,000 years. An area the size of the United States. When we think of the growing pressures on land from modern populations we often picture sprawling megacities. But urban land accounts for just 1% of global habitable land, while pastures take 35%. Humanity\u2019s biggest footprint is due to what we eat, not where we live.*\n\n[Global meat production has more than tripled over the last 50 years. ](https://ourworldindata.org/soy)\n\n*Beef stands out immediately. The expansion of pasture land to raise cattle was responsible for 41% of tropical deforestation. That\u2019s 2.1 million hectares every year \u2013 about half the size of the Netherlands. Most of this converted land came from Brazil; its expansion of beef production accounts for one-quarter (24%) of tropical deforestation. This also means that most (72%) deforestation in Brazil is driven by cattle ranching.*\n\n[Biodiversity conservation: The key is reducing meat consumption](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26231772/)\n\n*Livestock production is the single largest driver of habitat loss, and both livestock and feedstock production are increasing in developing tropical countries where the majority of biological diversity resides. Livestock production is also a leading cause of climate change, soil loss, water and nutrient pollution, and decreases of apex predators and wild herbivores, compounding pressures on ecosystems and biodiversity.*\n\n[Avoiding meat and dairy is \u2018single biggest way\u2019 to reduce your impact on Earth](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth)\n\n*Biggest analysis to date reveals huge footprint of livestock - it provides just 18% of calories but takes up 83% of farmland.*\n\nNow you know.

They spread seeds as best as they can and as well as necessary and grow back as fast as a person or large mammal does, in an instant geologically speaking\n\nEdit: let me put it another way. There\u2019s an estimated 3 trillion trees on earth and an estimated 15 billion are felled yearly. This means the average tree has 200 years to be replaced after it\u2019s felled. And to be replaced it needs just 10, worst case 40 years. Average it out to 25, over which time the tree\u2019s size scales from 0 to full size, so performance of its function averages out to 50% efficiency. This means the entire logging industry takes up just 6,25% of tree function from functioning at a time",
