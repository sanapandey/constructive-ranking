My dad worked for NASA his entire career, first programming computers and calculating launch trajectories &c., then later as a tech writer and editor, editing reports and collating data from missions. I also became a tech writer, though I never got to work for NASA. But I was raised to be a True Believer, and I still get so damned excited every time we hear from Voyager 1 again.\n\nMy dad was there from the NRL days, he was at Cape Canaveral for the first Vanguard launch, and he finally retired during the Shuttle program. He lived a truly remarkable life, and witnessed an incredible amount of history, and I wish he were alive today so I could tell him that Voyager is still kicking.\n\nPS: Recently in a space documentary I spotted a photo of Werner von Braun talking to a group of NASA employees, and one of them was my dad. I was so fucking excited!",

My 82yo dad is a retired electrical engineer who helped design and build payloads on both Voyager I and II for then-TRW (now Northrop Grumman). He worked on so many amazing projects throughout his years including Viking. His last project was very early drafting and proposals of the James Webb Space Telescope. \n\nMy brother followed in his footsteps, including directing onboard propulsion for JWST. He arranged a time for us to see JWST in person at NGC just prior to its launch. We pulled the kids out of school and got to see it through the observation window with the sails fully deployed. It was absolutely mind-blowing. I'm talking stunning. And inspired my own son to start studying astrophysics. \n\nWhen JWST successfully launched on Christmas morning, 2021, my husband, kids, and I showed up to our family Christmas dinner wearing JWST t-shirts \ud83d\ude04",

It really is such a privilege to be so up close and personal with space exploration. I got to meet a couple of astronauts (Al Worden, CMP of Apollo 15, and Joe Kerwin, Science Pilot for Skylab 2). I had all sorts of space swag, which, unfortunately, my mother confiscated and hid away until I was older. I never got to see any of it again. But still. It was great.\n\nI would have loved to work for NASA, but it just never happened for me. I'm really glad your brother did get that chance! The JWST is an absolute miracle. You must be so proud.",
