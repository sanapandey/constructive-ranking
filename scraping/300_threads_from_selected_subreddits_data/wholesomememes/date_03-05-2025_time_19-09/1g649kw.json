Can\u2019t really help you much with the escape thing, I get it, but I feel like telling you it\u2019s a matter of perspective would be less than helpful. Meaning though is something I recently figured out for myself at least. \n\nI\u2019m 36 years old and am just now realizing what it is I want to do with my life. It\u2019s not what I would have expected, not at all what I had planned. But I\u2019ll be damned if I don\u2019t feel like \u201cI\u201d have meaning now. Which in turn helped reshape my perspective, I no longer want to escape. Rather I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be gone before getting everything done that I want to do. I lived nearly 2 decades in a pit of self destruction. The only reason I\u2019m still here is because I had stronger, better people than myself to help keep me together. Now that I\u2019ve pulled myself out of that pit I want nothing more than to show those people that their efforts, patience, and love were not wasted. And, to do whatever I can to help pull others out of their own darkness. I never would have made it to where I am now had I not had the impetus to fight through the darkness I found myself in, even if some days were survived out of pure spite for this world. I can now take the pain suffered, some self inflicted, and use it to hopefully help others. \n\nMy point is it took one person nearly 4 decades to figure out who they are and what can give their life meaning. And they didn\u2019t do it alone either. You\u2019re still here, you\u2019re still fighting. Just don\u2019t give up the fight before you even learn just what exactly it is you\u2019re fighting for.",

Over time, you'll better understand what really matters, and new setbacks will panic you less. \n\nIn short, yes, it really does get better.",
