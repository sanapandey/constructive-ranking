I was recently hospitalized for a month during which I also had my 23rd bday. My bf texted me once or twice on my bday and maybe 2 other times during which he just replied to some basic health updates (I had a major surgery and bad infection) . It was my best friend who checked in with me almost every morning to make sure I was still OK. Asking if I was eating any easier and calling when I was briefly alone in the room cus I was more or less stuck inside for a month and they knew I was struggling. Sometimes what you need is a good friend. I genuinely loved my ex and he said he loved me yet it was my friend who was actually there for me when I actually needed it. They live across the country and they've put in more effort for us to visit than my ex who lives 3 hours away.",
