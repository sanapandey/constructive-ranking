No one wants you. Everyone wants to foster cute little kids and babies, way less people want a strange traumatized teen in their home, even if they\u2019re a well-behaved, good kid. I got placed with my baby brother, and they loved him, and tolerated me with him. I remember how depressing it was to be an unwelcome guest in another family\u2019s home. I would want to give another teen a safer space to grow up in than I had, and my experience gives me the ability to understand their struggles.\n\nSome foster teens end up getting put in juvenile detention facilities, even though they have no behavioral problems or criminal record, just because there are no foster beds open for them. Many get shuffled around, abandoned, and sometimes abused in the system. Many end up homeless when they age out. It\u2019s tragic.",

I think there are a lot of misinformed people in this thread diminishing the very tangible differences between raising biological vs. foster children. \n\nUntil you foster - especially teenagers - it's impossible to know what you're getting into. The trauma foster kids go through absolutely creates a different challenge. You don't get to start on day 1. You have to look at this 16 year old who has built years of maladaptive coping mechanisms, deeply internalized pessimism, and an absolutely bottomless sense of worthlessness and work every. fucking. day. to deprogram that. \n\nHow do you build a sense of self-worth out of a lifetime of abuse and neglect? How do you teach a teenager to ascribe value to their actions and their lives when someone else has spent over a decade telling them otherwise? It is soooooo much more than just being patient and empathetic, and you will need to forgive sooooooo much more than just temper tantrums and disrespect. \n\nNone of this makes foster children less worthwhile to raise. I am constantly impressed by the resilience of these kids, and working together to chip away at the trauma and then see the beauty underneath begin to shine out... it's a sublime feeling, something deeper than love.",

As it turns out, my partner was actually super triggered by the session and realized they had some stuff from their own traumatic childhood to work through in order to be a healthy parent to a traumatized kid, foster or otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFostering and adoption are fantastic but also, it's unfair to the kids to not consider your fitness for that responsibility very carefully and do the work to prepare yourself.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, semi related, something that absolutely drives me nuts is the way people talk about fostering to adopt without acknowledging how many kids in foster care still have the possibility of reunification and that's usually *what the kids want* and often what's actually best for them. It's sad to me to hope their bio families fail and people can be unintentionally very callous about it.",

You don't know who their bio parents or previous foster parents were And I work with a lot of kids who refuse to be placed with lgtq families, are deeply religious, racist etc. obviously kids may develop their own boundaries but stuff like that you can try to raise your kids with your own values. It's hard to adopt a kid whose almost an adult who hates you for who you are and isn't interested in learning\n\nAlso some of these kids don't want to be adopted. I think the liberal saviour complex tells us they're all desperate for a family but most I've come across are very jaded, many never bond with or care about their foster parents no matter how much the parents try, many are angry to be in the system not grateful. So fostering, you may not be fulfilling some kids dream like you want and they may not want you to adopt them\n\nLast is this thread kinda dismisses that lots of people can't afford to help but want to and not adopting allows you to keep the kids and care for them with some financial assistance from the fostering program. Your kid may also get more access to free supports like therapy, skills training, occupational and behaviour therapy, speech pathology etc\n\nEdit: sorry adding more. People also need to weigh if they're able to deal with the traumatic things that may come up for the kid and listening to those stories. Any kid may be abused but you can do more to protect them. As a foster parent you're likely to repeatedly hear stories of abuse and neglect that are hard, especially if you love or care about the kid they happened to. And their stories may traumatize any other kids or family in the home.",

It was one of my favorite jobs being able to work with these kids. Obviously they had behavioral and trust issues, but if you consistently show up for them and do what you say you will do they\u2019ll over time begin to trust you. \n\nFostering middle schoolers and high schools has been a dream of mine for a long time. I hope to provide a stable home for these children where they feel loved and supported. If only I could afford a two bedroom apartment :,)",

One of my biggest fears of ever becoming a parent is the ages where I can't have a rational conversation with my child about things that matter. I hate the idea of being the parent whose answer is \"because I said so\", and there's an age range where kids simply can't be given a logical explanation for why it's bad to stick a fork in a light socket.",

It wouldn't do anything it was asked to do. It was literally just a human vessel. It was given back to the adoption agency several weeks later, after destroying a 10 year marriage and leaving my friend with ptsd. The adoption agency said 9 out of 10 adoptions don't last through the trial period.\n\n\n\nThis girl thinking she can just take on a 17 year old and parent it for the rest of its life is clueless.",
