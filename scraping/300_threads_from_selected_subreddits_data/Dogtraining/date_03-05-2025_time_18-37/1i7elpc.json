It\u2019s my first time posting here and I hope someone can guide me. Getting an in person trainer is unfortunately out of my budget so I\u2019m trying the best I can without one for now. \n\nI have a 7 year old female Pomeranian. She has lived with other dogs in the past and when we brought her home around 9 months, she came to a home with two cats and several dogs. Eventually we moved out with the cats and moved into my moms\u2019s who had an older, calmer dog. And she became best friends with him. \n\nFast forward, the cats and the dog have passed and are no longer with us and I have moved out to live with my fiance. She has been an only child for about 3 years. We just recently added a new kitten to our family. We brought him home at 2 months old. We had them separated for a bit and he sleep in an enclosed mesh playpen where she can see him but not get to him. She initially lunged and attacked him but never bit or hurt him. We separated them and realized this was going to take more time. She is okay when I take him out of the pen and hold him. She walks around and acts normal. Occasionally, she comes over and sniffs him. But other times like today she doesn\u2019t want to and if I bring him to her to have her see, she side eyes him and turns around to walk away. If I get to close or insist she shows her teeth. So at that point I back off and will back off if I see the whale eye look. \n\nHow do I get her to accept him?? He is very playful and smaller than our other cats because he\u2019s still a baby. Has anyone else experienced this? Our kitten is quite friendly and really wants to play with her but she\u2019s not ready. \n\nAt times, we see her approach him tent and try to play from outside with him. She gets in a play bow and runs around in circles and comes back to him. She\u2019ll scratch the pen and looks excited to play. He will also paw at her and roll around against the mesh to play. So I\u2019m not sure. There are a lot of mixed feelings here and it\u2019s confusing for all of us. We only want the safety of everyone!! The video of them has only happened twice where we get that kind of reaction. ",

We feed them close to each other and at the same time so they associate food with each other. We also praise both of them for being calm around each other. My dog does not bark or act aggressive when cat is in playpen but we get aggressive behavior when he is taken out of playpen and gets closer to dog. I still need help with this problem.",
