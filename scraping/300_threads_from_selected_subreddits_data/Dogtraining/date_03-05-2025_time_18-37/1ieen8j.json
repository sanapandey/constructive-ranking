    "selftext": "We will be moving and have a Keeshond and Pyrenees (she is very small for her breed- about 70lbs). They bark a lot at outside noises which doesn\u2019t bother us but will definitely bother our neighbors. We are worried about not being able to find a house and will have to settle for an apartment. Has anyone moved into an apartment for the first time with their dogs? If so, how did you acclimate them? \n\nThanks!!",

I have 2 dogs, a black lab mix and a min pin and as much as they are trained- the smaller dog tinkles in our bathroom- and I do see a difference in their normal mood without the roaming of the yard freedom. And the constant need to be leashed when outside is a huge inconvenience for me personally but my apartment complex has a dog park.. if you're ok with walking it several times a day then you should be fine.\u00a0\u00a0",
