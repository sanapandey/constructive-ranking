    "selftext": "I have to say, I'm really at a loss. I have a six ish year old 13 pound yorkie mix (a rescue) and in my apartment, she's about 90% house trained. I never have any problems when I leave her alone in the apartment, even for longer periods of six to seven hours. I have had her for going on two years. \n\nShe has a relatively consistently schedule, although not perfect because, you know. Life. I work at the office during the day and my roommate is home with her during the day. No issues. She gets taken out at least four times a day, usually more.\n\nExcept, every couple of months she decides to pee inside, usually twice in succession (like within a day or two). Additionally, whenever we go somewhere new (my parent's house, a friend's, etc) she is VERY prone to peeing on a carpet, but that at least makes sense as it's a new location and usually, there's other dogs so it might be a marking thing.\n\nBut what I don't understand is why she does this so sporadically in my apartment! There aren't any other dogs; it's just her. This past summer I'd reached a breaking point and spent months where I rewarded her for almost every single time she peed outside (occasionally I would forget to grab the treats for the morning walk-- but only every once and a while! Surely that can't be the reason??) and nothing changed. One month in, having no problems and now she gets cheese every time she pees, boom. Randomly pees on the carpet. I keep going, still rewarding her, but it keeps happening. The issue is, it's so infrequent it's like she's 90% house trained. Also, I know that she knows that if she pees outside she gets a treat, because after she pees she turns and looks to me for her treat (and I've caught her fake peeing outside just because she wants a treat).\n\nShe's spayed; I use Nature's miracle to clean the pee spots; I also have a Bissel carpet cleaner. I know her pee habits-- she likes to mark and therefore will never get all of her pee out at one time. She always has to pee at LEAST three or four times on a walk.\n\nShe also doesn't really indicate when she wants to go out very well-- she's a very quiet dog in general. But normally she sort of stands by the door and I know that's my cue to take her out, if it's not around our normal schedule time. A lot of guides say you have to watch them consistently or they have to be crated until they can pee consistently outside but she does consistently pee outside. Except once a month when she decides its time to pee inside again.\n\nI can't really figure out triggers either. It's happened in the morning, afternoon, night time. Right after going out. The second to last time, it was about twenty minutes after I moisturized her paws (she hates this). Tonight, it was while I was brushing my teeth. We did our night time walk like usual and she peed multiple times outside. She is in a cone right now (has some stitches she needs to not scratch), but this is just the latest time in a long time of times when everything seemed normal.\n\nI really don't know what else to do. Everything I've read says to start potty training completely over, with the rewarding system and crating them when you can't watch them like a hawk. But she hates being in her crate when left alone (a lot of rescues don't do well) and that would mean she's in her crate for well over eight hours a day, because my roommate cannot pay that much attention to her while she's working from home (also, that's never when she pees inside anyways). And then I guess my question is, do I crate her all the time when I'm home? Because for instance tonight, she was out of my sight for less than sixty seconds and that's all it took. But that just doesn't seem like a practical solution, to be honest, and she would be miserable. Especially because it's so infrequent!\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. I'm very close to hiring a dog trainer, but it would definitely be a strain on my budget at the moment, unfortunately, so thought I'd see what reddit had to say first! ",
