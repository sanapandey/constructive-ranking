    "selftext": "My dog does this low level whining constantly through the day. He\u2019s been to the vet, we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s anything physical. He\u2019s currently on 40mg of Prozac a day along with 100mg of trazadone twice a day - he\u2019s a very anxious dog, super sound sensitive. \n\nAnyway. I\u2019ve been trying to do things like the relaxation protocol, or waiting out his whining. I must not have done a good enough job paying attention to his signs because he learned to bring it down to this lower level. So now it\u2019s really difficult to tell when he\u2019s actually relaxed because he can give me the body signs he is, head down, laying down on one hip, and if there\u2019s enough noise around (the tv, people talking etc.) I won\u2019t necessarily hear him whining. \n\nSo I feel like I\u2019ve reinforced this. And it makes training so stressful because I feel like I\u2019m messing up every time. And if I just try to wait it out it can take literally over an hour of sitting waiting for him to stop whining. Which doesn\u2019t feel beneficial because it\u2019s not really tiring him out in any meaningful way to keep him calm for a while for me to get work done. And I feel like I\u2019m never doing it right anyway. And this noise just grates on me so much partially because it\u2019s annoying partially because every time I hear him whine I just think about how I\u2019ve messed this up and just feel like an awful owner because he\u2019s obviously not happy. \n\nAny help or tips would be appreciated.

We have really upped the amount of general training we do.

He will nap through the day but the majority of the time he is awake he is whining. \n\nI am going to ask my vet to see if we should switch to gabapentin, maybe the trazadone is having an opposite effect.",

She will run until she literally collapses if I let her. Her behavior is directly tied to how much I exercise her.  \n\nWe had a warmer few days where we hiked for an hour and a half.. the snow was up to her shoulders so every step was a jump. She still had enough energy to zoom through the house when we got home.  \n\nMy girl isn't medicated (my vet and i decided against it) but has anxiety and all kinds of behavioral problems. The only time I saw her calm was after a 3 day backpacking trip where we hiked a total of 36km with lots of elevation. It was like having a whole new dog for 2ish weeks. They are animals made for movement, not to sit on a couch all day.",

            "body": "That's a lot of drugs bud.\n\nMy dog sounds like this when he wants something from me; either attention or outside to pee/poo. \n\nIf yours is doing it like this constantly and it isn't a pee/poo reason then I'm going to guess your pup is bored and in desperate need of stimulation.\n\nNow there's far better experts on here but I'll give you some advice from my own experience with cattle dogs and cattle dog crosses who do need that stimulation.\n\nSo here's what I'd tell you, while physical stim is good; mental stim is king. So you need to start playing mental games with your dog. \n\nEasiest way to start, especially if you're in a one dog household, is \"Seek/Find it\". Have your dog go in a sit/stay. Show your pup the treat then place the treat somewhere close and release with \"Seek\" encouraging them to find the treat. Gradually increase the distance and obscurity of where the treat is. Then the number of treats. Then the variety of treats. This turns the boring house into an exciting place where treats could be stashed anywhere. It allows the dog to use its natural hunting and smelling ability and since its a normal natural thing this is probably one of the easiest \"tricks\" you'll ever teach a dog.\n\n(for reference; I took my two pups to visit my mom. Did a sit/stay with my pups, my mom held her dog. Hid the treats around my mom's place and then did a \"seek\". Her dog immediately followed mine and with only that one rep, she already knew what seek was. The next time we did \"seek\" about 30mins later, she did just as well despite her size disadvantage)\n\n  \nAnother thing you can do thats dead on simple is not to feed your dog in a bowl but make it \"work\" for their entire meal. It sounds cruel but it isn't and dogs do love it. Basically turn feeding time into training time. Once you're done, finish with a real treat, and you'll probably find that your pup with curl up and go to sleep pretty soon after the whole event.\n\nThe benefit for this is it gets two things done at once. Both training and feeding. A secondary benefit is an increase in understanding between you and your dog. If yours is like mine, it whines when there is something amiss and its frustrated you're not understanding. There is a certain amount of excitement and enjoyment dogs, especially smart dogs, get from understanding what you want from them. \n\n  \nAnyways; those would be my simple suggestions that you can put into action right away without needing to put down any money at all.\n\nIf you're not sure what to do for training, if you're choosing the second thing i meantioned, just go to online resources on youtube for training ideas and tips. Kikopup is pretty good iirc [https://www.youtube.com/@kikopup](https://www.youtube.com/@kikopup)",

There is a high likelihood that your dog is experiencing physical discomfort that is contributing to their difficulty relaxing. I know someone whose dog's behaviour was very similar to yours. Initial pain investigation found nothing, we proceeded with bmod, results weren't progressing at the rate we expected, so they started him on Prozac. The dog improved but still struggled. Second pain investigation showed a joint issue requiring surgery. The dog was under 2 years old and a small breed. Pain can be a factor regardless of age or breed.",

            "body": "My dog whines when he wants something.  But I can always figure out what it is as he will show me-go by it or look at it when I ask.   He also needs a lot of play as he's a border colli/aussie shepherd. A lot of the whining is reminding me he wants me to throw his toy if I get distracted or take too long. Either that or he brings me every other toy to see if I prefer to throw one of those.  He also stares in a ready to go position until I throw it. I feel bad when I get distracted and realize he's been standing there staring for 30 min. Sometimes he will lay down but man I feel horrible..",

            "body": "Just wondering how old your dog is? My lurcher is super whiny as well,  and I've often wondered if there's some pit bull in his mix, he's a stocky boy who's smart and needs loads of mental and physical stimulation.\n\nMy boy's 4 this year and he is starting to mellow out a bit, but yeah I know first hand how annoying the whining is and I felt guilty and like it's my fault, the same as you.\n\nWhat we have done is ensure all his needs are met, food, walk, play, training, and when he's still whining after all that, we ignore. It can take a while, but forcing him to self soothe like this is working for us. It did take ages, though, and also, I had to train myself not to give in to him every time because I am a pushover when it comes to my dogs! Consistency and patience. If he's young, and this is not a medical issue in your case, hopefully, this helps.",

I walk my dog for like 1-2 hours a day and play fetch almost daily. Hikes are awesome as well but it\u2019s winter so my dog is chilling more than normal. It gets better with time but my dude is 5 now and still does this sometimes.",

That instruction to go to bed lets him swtich off and he relaxes. Maybe this would help?",
