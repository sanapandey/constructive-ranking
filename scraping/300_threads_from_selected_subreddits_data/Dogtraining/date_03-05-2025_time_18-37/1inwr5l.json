    "selftext": "Hello, \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I have two dogs. One is 6, we got her from the shelter a year and a half ago, and one is 4 who we\u2019ve had since he was a homeless puppy. They\u2019re both relatively well mannered as they have never had aggressive encounters with people or other dogs. Our biggest problem is that they both bark a good amount especially when they are in our fenced in backyard. The younger one tends to bark more at random stuff and the older one is terrified of everything after her original owners did whatever they did to her, so she barks in a more reactive manner. The older one doesn\u2019t have great recall either and she also likes to bolt out the front door if given the opportunity. \n\nLast week, we had a professional come to our home for a $300 consultation. He had us: crate them and have only one dog come out of the crate at a time so they can\u2019t interact, tie ropes to their collars at all times so when they bark or do something that we don\u2019t want we tug them until they stop, have a longer outdoor rope that we switch them onto for then they go in the yard, stop taking them on walks and to the park, stop letting them on the couch with us, give them positive reinforcement for eye contact and when they use the bathroom. He also wants us to get herm sprenger prong dog collars but they\u2019re out of stock for the young one\u2019s size at the moment. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve forgotten a thing or two but we\u2019ve been pretty strict about sticking to his regiment. We\u2019ve noticed results but that\u2019s to be expected as their worlds have shrunk so there\u2019s much less stimulation. I\u2019ve also noticed the older dog barely uses the bathroom anymore and won\u2019t go at all at night. This week, we contacted him again to see if we could continue his work with us and he informed us that we can do a 16 week program for around 5000 dollars. Unfortunately we don\u2019t have the extra pocket change for that unless we dipped into our savings. We told him this and he said there\u2019s a 5 week program that will be around 1500.  We\u2019d go with that but we\u2019re worried we\u2019ll just end up renewing it until we\u2019ve spent the same amount. \n\nBefore I posted this I read a few of the articles on here and the methods of training recommended seems different then what we\u2019ve been doing. I\u2019d love to know this community\u2019s thoughts on my situation. Should we keep working with this company? Was their advice sound in the first place? \n\nSorry for the info dump but any help and advice would be appreciated! ",

This guy is using outdated methods, total hack. There is a better trainer out there much much cheaper. What he\u2019s doing can cause reactivity. Having well-trained dogs (for example, impressive obedience skills and tricks) is a much different skill level than shaping reactive behavior in pet dogs. You need someone with a science-backed approach.\n\nAlso super expensive for a consultation. I got amazing help for $100/hr.",

            "body": "I would reach out to your local shelter/humane society and ask for a recommendation for a trainer. It's good to get a second opinion when it comes to reactivity- especially fear based. I would never use punishment with a dog experiencing fear. It suppresses behavior as opposed to modifying it. Your older dog not wanting to use the bathroom or go out at night signifies to me they are becoming more afraid as opposed to more confident and less afraid.\n\nWhat I have done is taught dogs to seek me/their trusted person out when they hear something that causes reactivity (except for people coming in- I want them to bark when people enter my home as long as they stop when I say). This is done through counter conditioning. This is a scientific approach that uses positive reinforcement. \n\nI identify which sounds cue them to react/bark and play those sounds at very low volume- I get a blue tooth speaker and put it in a different room and play the sound at a volume that I can't even hear. If you watch the dog closely you can see they do hear it by changes in their body language (perked ears, still body, head tilts, etc). I reward them for hearing the sound with food teaching them \"see when you hear this- good things happen to you, and those good things come from me\" If your dog reacts to the sound that means you have pushed them over there threshold and you are either playing the sound too loud, too close, or too long. These practice sessions should be short- no more than 5 minutes.\n\nMy mentor (a behaviorist) explained it to me through this analogy: \"the 100 dollar spider\" Many people are afraid of spiders- it may seem unreasonable to many of us, but it can send people in anxiety attacks. If I had a friend that yelled every time they saw a spider and I smacked them with a newspaper each time they did that- they would eventually stop yelling at spiders because they don't want me to smack them. I'm just causing discomfort, not actual pain, but my friend it learning to suppress their fear because they don't want their good friend smacking them. I got the result I wanted, peace and quiet, but how do you think my friend feels about me now? Do you think its likely that eventually my friend grabs that newspaper and smacks me with it in response? That's the danger with suppressing behavior, is that it can eventually reach a boiling over point.\n\nIts better to change how my friend feels about spiders. This is where that $100 comes in. I show my friend a picture of a spider- sure it may still cause some anxiety to see a picture but it doesn't cause my friend to yell. I say \"good job\" and hand them 100 bucks. If we repeat that process enough looking at a spider just causes my friend to come to me with their hand out for that cash. Then I bring a spider into the room- but far away and do the same thing \"good job, here's $100\". We increase the level of exposure, but always keeping my friend under threshold. It's a process but I'm helping my friend conquer a fear, which increases their confidence and their trust in me as their friend.",

Meaning literally anyone can call themselves a trainer without any sort of certification, education, or experience with even owning a dog. This unfortunately leads to a lot of people proclaiming themselves as a professional when they have zero business handling dogs.\n\nLook for someone who specializes in force free/R+ training. And don't be afraid to ask them questions. Ask for certifications, what tools they use, what happens when the dog does the 'wrong' thing. That will give you an idea of how they train. Any trainer using punishment simply lacks the skills required to train humanely. And I do believe a lot of these trainers could totally make the switch, they just refuse to put in the work.",
