    "selftext": "Hi, I have a 2 year old cocker spaniel. We rescued him at 5 months so spent the last year and a half teaching him the basics. His name, sit, down (lie down), move (with an away motion when he starts jumping), back (sit a couple steps away facing me normally for food). Most of this was done inside/in the garden so when he goes out it's nose on the ground and ears not working. \n\nHere's what I'm here to ask. I want to start letting him off lead when out but his recall is shocking when out. How do I get it good enough that I can let him run and when I call for him he comes back? My last place had a huge garden and he would listen to start off with but he always slowly ignored me. He would look over and carry on which isn't what I need in a field \ud83d\ude05 \n\nI also want to teach him the leave/leave it command. Whether it's for dogs/people/objects/animals. How do I go about doing that? \n\nIf anyone has any good \"dog treat pick n mix\" bags where there's a variety of training treats it would be appreciated. Thank you for all help to come and sorry this post is so long ",
