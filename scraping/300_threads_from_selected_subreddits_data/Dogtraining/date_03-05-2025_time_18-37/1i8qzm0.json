    "selftext": "Since moving from a private house to an apartment, my 14-year-old dog has been struggling with noises from upstairs, like chairs dragging or items falling. Whenever he hears these sounds, he runs off to another part of the apartment, sometimes barking and looking visibly distressed. Because of his age, it\u2019s been harder to train him for new behaviors. I really want to help him feel more secure and reduce his stress. Does anyone have advice or tips for helping a senior dog adjust to a noisy environment?",

And no way to give him a \u201cheads up\u201d as it happens without warning.\u00a0\n\nProbably would not end well if you buy upstairs neighbor felt stickers for the chair legs.\n\nI\u2019m not confident but a couple of ideas:\n\nIf there is a way to record some of these sounds and then play them back on your lowest volume setting as he eats or get treats or during play, and every once in a while turn it up louder but ever so slowly. Baby steps.\u00a0\n\nAnother option might be to see if he finds D Wave music helps to mask the sound.\u00a0\n\nHope he adjusts. \u2764\ufe0f",
