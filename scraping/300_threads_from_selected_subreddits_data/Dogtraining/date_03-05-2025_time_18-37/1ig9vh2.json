    "selftext": "I apologize in advance for the lengthy post but I\u2019m so lost and overwhelmed with this situation. \n\nI have an almost 2 year old mix breed rescue dog that started resource guarding almost a year ago. Due to some issues with a landlord my fianc\u00e9 and I were evicted at short notice and are now living with her mother. We have 2 other dogs one a full sibling from the same litter as him and 2 cats. Mother-in-law(mil) has a dog and a cat.\n\nHe was about 4 months old when we moved. I\u2019ve had him from 4 days old because his mother tried to kill him, causing a bad wound so he is a bottle baby if that could be an issue. He was fixed at about 8 months. \n\nWe believe he learned the behavior from my mil\u2019s dog but I\u2019m not sure if that is something that can cause it. Mil\u2019s dog is Pomeranian Finnish spitz mix that is extremely reactive and growls/barks all the time. She won\u2019t do anything about the behavior so any training we try to do with him is just canceled out (their dog also doesn\u2019t act like that when they\u2019re not home so I believe he knows they will let him get away with it). We want to help both dogs but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible if they don\u2019t keep up on their dog too. \n\nMy dog now growls and gets antsy anytime he has food or treats. When it is close to feeding time he paces, whines, shakes, gets really tense, and overall shows a lot of anxiety and frustration with feeding. He stares us down intensely, watching every move we make waiting to see if his food bowl is being brought out. He has to eat from a slow feeder or he makes himself sick with how fast he eats. We\u2019ve tried feeding him in a separate room with the door shut, feeding him in his kennel with it covered, feeding him last, making him wait and lay down completely before calling him to eat, I\u2019ve tried calming supplements, anxiety medication from the vet, and so much more. I\u2019m just at a complete loss as to what to do for him. Does anyone have any advice I haven\u2019t thought to try or know anything I can do to help him? I don\u2019t want to give him up because I have had him so long but i keep getting told it will be safer and better for all animals involved. ",

Issues like resource guarding and separation anxiety tend to escalate with age.   You can continue to manage the issue by isolating the dog during meal times and making sure you are not feeding until the dog is calm.  Hand feeding works with some.  \n\nConsult a behaviorist.",

Every time they hand out treats her toys they're expecting to have to break up a fight between dogs that resource guards. And moving is always stressful on everyone",

Please don\u2019t try any shock collars, yelling, leash popping, ANY punishment as this will make it worse. Resource guarding and reactivity is almost always due to fear and this will either make it worse or lead to fallout (getting better and then getting 10x worse).",

Nothing he can guard.\n\nFind a set up that will allow him to eat unbothered. I would personally get an automatic feeder. If he eats too fast then you can set up a smaller amount of food per feeding with more often feeding times. So, if he eats two cups of food a day then he would eat a half cup of food four times a day. I would put this in a room with low traffic. Maybe a spare bedroom or bathroom that you have. Make sure not to be around him when he's eating.\n\nAfter that, I recommend a behaviorist. Resource guarding needs a lot of knowledge to be able to understand and handle, something that people on reddit could never offer. There's just too much that goes into it and someone needs to be in person to help you.",

            "body": "To confirm I understand the scope of the problem - it sounds like he does not resource guard towards humans, correct? How severe is his resource guarding towards other animals? Has he ever hurt another animal? Is the primary problem his obvious discomfort/anxiety, or do you think he is potentially a danger to the other animals? \n\nManagement is key to start with. I'd continue feeding him separately and giving him treats separately as well. Many dogs really need to feel safe and secure while eating, and that's a reasonable thing to offer him. If he's crate-trained, you can give him meals and treats in the crate. Is his behavior okay when he eats alone? Or does he still show anxiety and resource guarding? \n\nAnother idea: do you think he might be chronically hungry? My girl is a mild resource guarder but it's been a bit worse recently\u2014and I realized that's probably because she's been on a diet for the past few months. Hunger can make resource guarding much worse. And hunger can be caused by diets, and medical problems (like poor nutrient absorbtion, or poor glucose management). A vet visit could be helpful. \n\nAs far as training goes\u2014it is trickier to work on training dog-to-dog resource guarding, but it there are some strategies. I would highly recommend working with a sklled professional because the details are so important. [This article](https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/behavior/resource-guarding/how-to-manage-your-resource-guarding-dog/) is pretty good, though, for offering ideas about what type of exercises and conditioning would help.",

My dog has GI issues so gets fed small meals 6 times a day, this might be a better option, if your only feeding him once or twice a day that's a long time to wait between meals if he finds it really stressful. \n\nCan you take him outside with handfuls of food and play games with him, so food is more fun and less stressful?
