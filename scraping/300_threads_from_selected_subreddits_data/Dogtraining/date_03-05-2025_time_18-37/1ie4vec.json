    "selftext": "Hey all! I\u2019m new to this page. I have an odd situation at hand. I\u2019ve since told my boss I am not comfortable with this situation after she had guilt tripped me into trying a few times. \n\nSo basically I work at a boarding facility. I have been there for 3 years. We have a \u201cpack\u201d of Corso\u2019s that come to stay with us every so often, at least once every few months. They have 3 girls that took one meet and greet with me and they love me. They have a male that also loves me but he\u2019s an OG from their first litter and he\u2019s old and sweet. The rest of the pack is made up of this Males offspring.\n\nHere\u2019s the issue. Their youngest male, I would always say \u201cno i dont want to meet him\u201d because hes known to be a very dangerous dog. Once he likes you he loves you, but it take a long time and the process is dangerous. My boss, the owner of the facility, who\u2019s good buddies with these dogs owners and the dogs now\u2026thinks they\u2019re perfectly fine to introduce to all of her employees. Many of which have no dog handling experience and are college kids. \n\nMy first time meeting this dog was with the owners, just him. He walked up to me slowly, growled then walked away, but otherwise kept his distance from me. However, the second time was with my boss. She let him out with his daughter, one of the females who likes me, and his aunt, another who likes me. Mind you I didn\u2019t move, I was very relaxed, I was sort of slanted sideways as to not meet him head on nor have my back turned. I did not move, even when he immediately charged me snarling. He leaped at me, all four paws off the ground, shoulder chucked me. Then trotted around me growling lowly like a warning. \n\nI stayed calm. I knew if I moved, reacted, felt nervous that it would only make it worse. So I told myself he\u2019s just scared and dominant and testing the waters. I will not react. Until. He eventually came over to me, leaned against me STRAIGHT BODY. He didn\u2019t look up at me. He was stiff as a board, put his body weight into me, gave one long deep loud growl. Then walked away after probably about 6-8 seconds. My boss said \u201cOh don\u2019t pet him but he\u2019s saying he likes you!\u201d\u2026.Ive always read and heard that a stiff straight body lean and growl is a challenge. Like saying \u201cdo something I dare you\u201d. Am I wrong or crazy? \n\nBefore anyone says all dogs pick and choose who they like, I agree. But this dog has never had a good experience with any other employee either. My boss said my experience with him was the best there has ever been besides herself\u2026.Need advice on how to handle this because she keeps saying i\u2019m dramatic because I have been saying with my 7 years of experience\u2026that even if eventually he CAN be great, why are we risking this with the other untrained employees with no experience at a place of business that is NOT a training facility? I felt unsafe which isn\u2019t an uncommon theme. But this felt different and she\u2019s strictly scoffed at me or belittled me for voicing my opinion on the dangers of this. \n\nAlso should add this dog has an unofficial bite record. He has bitten many people, just not enough to send them to a hospital or report it. He is not neutered and is still being bred by these owners. ",
