I like the training treats because they are already small, and he's already a big guy. The issue is the smaller the treat the more expensive they seem to be!  Does anyone have any go-to treats or brands that you use frequently that can be a good bulk deal? (My guy is allergic to chicken)",

Pretty sure the ones at Costco (Nutri-Bites) say you can only give around 6/day and I wouldn\u2019t even want to give that many every day, so I don\u2019t use the liver ones for training. But Nutri-Bites also makes freeze dried salmon, and my dogs are obsessed with it! Low cal and you can feed a high quantity.Snif-Snax has a soft salmon treat my dogs love - I just spend a few mins cutting the whole bag up into training size pieces. I buy at [Sam\u2019s](https://www.samsclub.com/p/salmon-bites-snif-snax-dog-treats/prod25201139?itemNumber=980305764&gStoreCode=8278&gQT=1)",

Thank you so much for this.  two of my trainer friends recommended dried liver as preferred treats.  my pup loves all the Nutri-Bites esp the chicken, but I didn't know how much she liked the chicken until they were sold out for the year.  I still have like 2 bags of the salmon . . . and something like 10 bags of the liver.  I tend to overbuy when I find something that works.  I'll use the liver sparingly and stock up on the rest as soon as costco gets the rest.",

You  can get a 2lb bag for \\~$30, and since its formulated to be a balanced meal, you don't have to worry about giving them too much \"junk food\"\n\nVital Essentials makes a freeze dried raw food sold in \"mini nibs\" form that is really good too.  the pieces are a lil bigger than a normal kibble, and they hold together well, unlike many freeze dried foods, so you don't end up with a pocket full of powder.    Its pricier than the air dried, stuff, though, still a good deal if youre using it as bulk treats rather than full meals.\n\nCheap Cat kibble is pretty effective too.   it's smelly, small, and you can get 5-10lbs of it cheap. Dogs seem REALLY into cat kibble for some reason, but it's tougher to find chicken free cat food.\n\nAs for things that are actually dog TREATS I like full moon \"savory sticks\"     You can get  a 1.5lb bag for about $16, and they are sturdy enough to keep in a pocket or training pouch without getting crumbly, and very easy to break off into little chunks (or precut up into lil training sized bits)    They come in beef, duck, or chicken and are MOSTLY just meat, so not too bad to feed a lot of.    They have a strong scent, but not a BAD scent, so work well as high value snacks.     They are literally just the uncut version of the \"savory bites\" but cheaper by weight.",
