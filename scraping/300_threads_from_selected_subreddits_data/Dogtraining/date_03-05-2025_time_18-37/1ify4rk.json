    "selftext": "Hi all, I recently rescued a 9 month-old from the South who\u2019s very timid (of course, he\u2019s been through a lot recently!), and has had trouble communicating he needs to pee and is too scared to leave the crate. He is house trained, but in the few days he\u2019s been with us he rarely has left his crate, and the couple of times we have gone into his crate to try and take him outside he has been resistant at each step and ultimately does not pee or poop outside. I want to try and figure out the best response to if he does have an accident while trying to violate his safe space as little as possible.\n\nAn example of how the past two mornings have been: fianc\u00e9 and I wake up, open up his crate, and give positive verbal affirmations while doing so. He doesn\u2019t leave the crate, and we try and drop treats around the crate or toss them from a visible spot down the hall to encourage him to leave. He will leave the crate to get the treats as long as we\u2019re a good distance away, and then retreat to the crate. Fianc\u00e9 and I give him space, and he attempts to come down the hall and around the corner to the living area to try and tell us he needs to go pee. He will come around the corner give a brief whine, but then at any sign of movement from us (even a head turn or a vocal affirmation), he will retreat to the crate. We try to encourage him from a distance to come back out, but when we turn the corner out of sight again he will have an accident outside the crate but next to it, and then completely retreat to the back of the crate.\n\nBased on that situation above, we are struggling to figure out the best response to his accidents. We aren\u2019t sure if violating his safe space in the crate to clip on a leash, and then practically drag him outside is the right response. At the same time, we don\u2019t want to do nothing and make it seem like going inside is ok behavior. Is it ok to try and go into the crate, clip his leash on, and bring him outside, and if not what should our response be if we do let him stay in the crate after an accident?\n\nI have read the wiki on house training and didn\u2019t find enough insight there to answer this question.",

This does not appear to be a case of separation anxiety based on the wiki information. We have tried reinforcing any positive behavior and communication he has exhibited, but because he rarely leaves the crate and retreat to it immediately there is not much behavior to enforce. We have tried verbal cues, presenting his leash, and standing by the door, but because he is still timid he will retreat to the crate.",

Talk to your vet about some meds to help bridge the gap while he transitions into living with you\n3. Give him time\n4. It\u2019s really hard, but the best thing you can do for a fearful dog is ignore them and let them set the pace. Don\u2019t pet him until he asks, try to stay out of his space as much as possible. Letting him make choices about interacting is going to make him more confident about seeing interactions",

            "body": ">and give positive verbal affirmations while doing so\n\nNo.  No talking.  Just leash on a long line and gently lead him out.  No petting at all.  \n\nHis space should be limited to one room or he should be on a leash in other parts of your home.\n\nTake out often as possible.  If he toilets outside, reward with high value food and calm praise \n\n>Based on that situation above, we are struggling to figure out the best response to his accidents\n\nNo response.  The accidents are your fault (sorry) for not providing enough guidance and restrictions.  You must manage him until you all figure it out.\nYou should be supervising, *tethering (leash him to you) or he should be crated.  Every accident indoors is a setback.  Prevention! \n\n>We aren\u2019t sure if violating his safe space in the crate to clip on a leash, and then practically drag him outside is the right response. \n\nGently and quietly, yes.",
