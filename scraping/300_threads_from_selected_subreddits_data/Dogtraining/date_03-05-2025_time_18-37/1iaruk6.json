    "selftext": "I have a 40lb Australian Cattle Dog that has taught herself how to shake off multiple leashes that I've never had a problem with before. \n\nShe has a high prey drive and must wear a prong collar (many other alternatives were tried first). When she sees something she wants to chase she will shake repeatedly until the leash unclips itself from her collar.\n\nHeavy duty/tactical clips do work but she's so small that they're too heavy and hit her chest hard and pull at the collar too much. \n\nAny advice on alternatives or where to find a small dog tactical leash?
