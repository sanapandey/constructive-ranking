    "selftext": "I have a really well behaved 3 year old Shih Tzu who developed a behavioral issue over the last few months.\n\nI\u2019ve taken him to the vet to check for pain and he doesn\u2019t have any. He\u2019s healthy.\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to go outside, like first thing in the morning, he hides from me for hours. If I try to catch him he will growl at me and try to bite me. If I leave him alone, he will literally hide all day if I let him (I think). Sometimes he will come out of hiding and cry at the door (asking to go out) but when I approach he hides again.\n\nMy theory is he hates his harness. But I\u2019ve gotten him plenty of new ones he refuses to walk in. Or he hates wearing a winter coat (we live in a cold climate).\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. Should I just not make him go out when he\u2019s mad and clearly telling me no? I\u2019m afraid of him developing a UTI or something.\n\nAlso, he loves being outside once I\u2019ve gotten his harness and leash on, he\u2019s good to go. He\u2019s confusing me lol.\n\n",
