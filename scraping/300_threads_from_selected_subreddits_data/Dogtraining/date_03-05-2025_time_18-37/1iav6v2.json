    "selftext": "Hello! My husband and I are looking to adopt our first dog from the shelter. We both grew up with dogs, but have not been primary caretakers for them. We have been primary caretakers for other animals, including an extremely special needs cat (sadly no longer with us so will not be an issue). We are looking to adopt from a shelter - I am looking for non-puppies, mostly dogs between 2-6 years old. Is this a bad idea? Is there anything I should know? \n\nWe are also looking for a small (under 20 pound) dog for personal reasons. Is there anything we should keep in mind for small dogs specifically?\n\nFinally, I will be the primary Caregiver day to day (I am disabled while my husband works). We do not have any children. Would it be acceptable to use some form of indoor pads for the days I struggle to get outside, or is this cruel? Any advice on this is greatly appreciated. (This is also part of why we want a small dog - much easier to exercise indoors. My husband will make sure the dog gets an exercise walk at least once a day, though. This is also part of the logic in not choosing a puppy.)\n\nMany thanks!! I am reading and learning a lot and very open to any advice - including the advice that we should not get a dog (although I am really hoping to!)",
