    "selftext": "We rescued a puppy from a hoarder house a few months ago. She was 6 months old at the time and the first 5 months of her life she was locked in a basement with 40+ other dogs and no real human interaction. We\u2019ve been trying really hard to socialize her w our friends and family and she\u2019s gotten a lot better but still pretty skittish and barks and growls a lot initially (she\u2019s a GSP, lab, mastiff, cane corso mix so she\u2019s 8 months but a solid 70 pounds with a scary bark lol). She loves her dog brother but she\u2019s pretty skittish with new dogs and will nip at them. We\u2019re trying to expose her young but does anyone have any tips to help this? I would love to have her dock dive and be a hunting dog but I know she needs other work first. \nI\u2019m experienced with obedience and hunting training and she\u2019s very smart and picking up commands quickly. Socializing a scared dog with trauma is somewhat new to me so any help would be appreciated! TIA ",

I am still wondering people\u2019s opinions/advice on how to handle certain situations with a dog w trauma as my dog came from a terrible hoarder situation and spent the first 5 months of her life with no interaction with anybody, and didn\u2019t start her \u201cnormal life\u201d until she was 6 months old",
