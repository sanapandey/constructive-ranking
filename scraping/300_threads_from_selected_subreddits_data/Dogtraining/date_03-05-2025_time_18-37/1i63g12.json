    "selftext": "From everyone who says \"keep your dog on long lead until he has perfect recall\", I would like to please know the exact step by step of the exercise you did while on long lead whenever you encountered another dog, in order to improve your dog\u2019s recall with distractions. \n\nMy 10 month old loves playing with other dogs, too much for his own good, and gets completely carried away with excitement. Right now his recall is only good when there aren\u2019t any distractions. We've had a few mishaps of him running full speed up to other dogs far away.  Thank goodness it only ended in healthy play each time, but we said absolutely no more. In the country where I'm currently based, everyone off leashes their dog, recall trained or not, and the people are less educated on dog training in general. So while it is difficult to get cooperation or understanding from other dog owners, I know better, so my guy is strictly on long lead no matter where we go. But at the same time, he\u2019s an insanely high energy breed and I\u2019d like to be able to off leash him in trails, fields, and mountains. \n\nI'd like some advice from owners of overly-social, dog-obsessed dogs on how you worked on proofing your dog\u2019s recall during your long lead only phase. Whenever we have to pass another dog (on trails for example), I\u2019m always conflicted between two options : 1. Put my dog a bit to the side to create distance and put him on a stay, and let the other dog pass without any interaction (he\u2019s quite good at this, plus I step on the leash just in case he tries) 2. Let them have a quick greeting, don\u2019t stay long enough to escalate to play and continue our way (if the other dog clearly isn\u2019t gonna play, my guy gets it and moves along, but if it\u2019s a playful dog, then they get into a play and it\u2019s hard to pull him away). I choose one or the other depending on the situation, but can anyone tell me which is more beneficial for my dog, if our goal is to have him become more neutral with dogs ? Increase dog interaction so it becomes something not so special and exciting ? Or avoid dog interactions even more and teach him that he should watch dogs but not play with them? \n\nSame for when we\u2019re at a park (on long lead) and another dog (almost always off lead) comes near and it\u2019s clear they both want to play. So far we let them play because when we\u2019re at the park, it\u2019s for him to run around and get his energy out but maybe this is making his dog obsession worse ? Is he doomed to be forever kept on leash? Do dogs become less exciting with age ? Any hopeful insight is appreciated \ud83e\udd7a",

This is a really hard time for training as they (like human teenagers) do not have the capability to make a lot of good decisions at this life stage.  We still practice everything we want him to do when he is mature. We just have a lot more management in place, so he can't practice bad decision making. I expect that he will be on a long line for another 6 to 10 months (slow maturing large breed). \n\nThis is what I am doing with my 9.5 month old dog. H used to be very good at walking past dogs, but now wants to play with everything. \n\nDogs that pull towards him - I move to the side and work on his focus and make sure they don't interact. \n\nDogs that ignore us, we walk on by, too. If it is someone we know with a suitable dog, we might do a 2- 3 second greeting. This is literally let the dogs sniff each other for 2 seconds, then move on. \n\nHe only plays with trusted dogs in a fenced area. We do not do dog parks as we are setting him up to make bad decisions there.",

I said the word and shoved pure cooked beef in her mouth.  I did this like 5 times.  Then I moved like 6 ft from her and said her word.  She came towards me for the beef. I did this several more times that day.  The next day I said her recall word where she could see me but with some distance and she started moving a little faster to get to that beef.  I took a day off, then resumed the next day, doing it several times, still as she could see me when I said the word.  After about a week, I did it when she had her back to me and was focused on a squirrel in the backyard.  She came.  So that week I did it several times a day in random places throughout the house.  Take a random day or two off though .  Then the next week I yelled her word from one part of the house while she was far away, couldn't see me.  She came booking it sooooo fast.   At this point, we took her to a large empty parking lot.  My husband and I stood on opposite sides and yelled her word from ith her off leash.   My husband would call her with her recall word and I would jump in front of her, start dancing, trying to distract her.  But by this point whoever said that word she was booking it to.  Basically it is done with consistent high value treats.   That word saves my ass because the rare times I can't find her, I tell her word and she will come bolting from wherever she is at.    It is magic.  And at this stage I just give her whatever is around.  Sometimes I don't have anything.  About once a month I will do it at random with something really yummy to keep it fresh and locked in.  Obviously you can do this with their name.  But my dog had about a 80% recall to her name.  I wanted the emergency recall word for those times when she ignores her name.  It works for other people. Like when I have a new pet sitter, I make them yell the word and she will come running.  It is honestly the best thing I ever trained her to do.",

I don\u2019t let her greet most dogs on walks now as I really want her to become more neutral (she\u2019s 2 and most of the time is great at walking past dogs on walks and not reacting). she also has some \u2018excitement reactivity\u2019 when she is near other dogs that are running around or chasing a ball - in those situations again I\u2019m working on trying to get her to focus on me\n\nwhen she is off leash in a fenced area or on the long leash I will always give her a treat when she comes back to me of her own accord and looks at me. she\u2019s very good at checking in when she is off leash even when she is playing with other dogs now. sometimes when she\u2019s off leash she\u2019ll spend 90% of the time walking right next to me staring at me it\u2019s funny, building that connection is very important \n\nabout a year ago her recall was basically at 10% and she completely ignored me when she was off the leash. she still has issues trying to run to other dogs occasionally\u2026 but her impulse control has really improved. it\u2019s taken a lot of work and I\u2019m still not at a point where I\u2019m comfortable with her completely off leash, but I have faith now that she will get there - just a lot of work! \n\nI\u2019ve met a lot of people, and in my family too, who really don\u2019t understand how having an overly playful and friendly dog is a problem !! so many people too never had to train recall and don\u2019t understand why I keep her on a long leash",

            "body": "My bratty adolescent puppy is slowly (VERY slowly) learning how to not immediately yeet himself over to say to EVERY dog he sees. Lots of it is impulse control, setting him up for success and also giving him the chance to burn off energy and play before I ask him to use his brain. He gets a solid 30-90 minutes of playtime and sniffing (I also randomly hide behind trees. He learns to check in with me since I will suddenly disappear every few minutes) in a 4 acre fenced field in the AM. We do a training walk midday and he is never allowed to greet other dogs on leash. He is VERY social and frankly doesn't GAF about whatever high value treat is in front of him if there is a dog close by. But we have slowly gone from him fixated and wagging his whole body if there is a dog 50 yards off to being able to disengage and mostly focus if there is a neutral dog 30 feet away. This took about 2 months of me actually putting in constant training (also frankly I think he is just growing up and his brain is slowly starting to work. He is 13 months old. He decided listening wasn't fun anymore around 8 months). I would never allow leash greetings until his recall is better and you make yourself higher value than other dogs (and also let him know that recall isn't optional). The long line is great for reeling them in then putting them in a training situation where they can make the right decision. I also make my puppy sit and wait for a release command before he can go play with other dogs in said field (we plan playdates with friendly trusted dogs and occasionally run into other dogs with varying levels of interest in an obnoxious puppy that wants to play). Either way he has to sit and stay before he can go play. At first we had to be 100 feet away and I had to hold his collar. Now we are down to about 20 feet and he is keeping his sit with minimal whining. If there is a dog that is clearly interested in playing on the other side of the field, he will finally ignore them after a couple minutes of really thinking about making dumb decisions. I have had more than a few folks tell me that collies tend to grow out of their teenaged nonsense around 2 yo. It depends a lot on breed and genetics too. Some lines mature a lot more slowly than others. Also impulse control games in general will help. Teaching a solid leave it with food/toys. Teaching an out with herding helped him too",

            "body": "You have to have recall - and general impulse control - down pat, as in never fails, in much less distracting environments than the park and/or on a walk before you even have a chance at getting your dog to even look at you with all those distractions.\n\nStart inside the house at home in a place and during a time with minimal distractions. Start with maximum-value treats, like pieces of boiled chicken. Start with giving him a piece each time he looks at you when you call his name. Repeat for at least a couple dozen training sessions. This needs to be like, ingrained subconscious behavior whenever you say his name. Only then can you proceed with sit-and-keep-sitting in a minimally distracting environment. Repeat that at least a couple dozen times, depending on how the dog does. It may need more. Then keep repeating, adding in distractions, all within the house.\n\nOnly after he has mastered everything you could throw at him in the house can you take him outside. Start outside with just the backyard, or better yet, a small, quiet, partitioned area of it might be better to start. Then the whole yard. Then randomly on a walk with no other people/things around. Then with people/things at a distance. Then up close. Then a busy park. Etc. Etc.\n\nIf you move too fast or inappropriately jump ahead, your dog will not be able to focus on what you want him to do, and all your efforts will go to waste. There are no shortcuts; this process can take several weeks; keep in mind that the dog can only take about 10-15 mins of training at a time before being completely exhausted by it. You can usually tell when he's had enough because he'll either stop responding to your training commands or lose interest in following patterns that have been getting him treats. In that case, end the training session, and maybe do another one later if the dog is up to it.\n\nGood luck!",

            "body": "As a young pup, they need to be set up for success to make good decisions. Until they have the ability to make those, make them for him. Play time should be carefully structured. I would go to a school field that is mostly fenced and has little to no other dogs there but still has some distractions like dogs walking past on the other side of the fence kind of thing. I would start doing recall training far away from the fence first, then build up to getting closer to the fence where he\u2019s nearer the dog distractions. There are several recall exercises you can do like moving from place to place with their favorite treat and saying \u201ccome\u201d or their name. As you move closer to the fence where other dogs are going to be a distraction, you should have worked your way up so the recall is a muscle memory while they can see other dogs but still listen to you without the opportunity to go and greet or play. Eventually you work your way up to walking past dogs on short leash still on trails etc but I would still do a no greet or play at all. If the pup doesn\u2019t have control yet go back to the fenced school yard until they master each level. Eventually, when the pup makes good decisions consistently you can allow a greeting, but keep it super short, and if they handle that well and come when called to keep moving consistently you can try off leash etc. But you can always go back a level until they\u2019re ready to graduate up. There are lots of different games and techniques for teaching recall specifically, and each dog will learn better from different techniques so try a few and see what works. I think putting them near a distraction but with a distinct fence or block from actually going and playing will help the pup to not learn bad habits and make good decisions going forward. Good luck.",

                    "body": "Remember, you can use a flexible just like you would a long line (holding the leash instead of the handle for leverage), the only difference when its used this way is your ability to quickly and safely take up slack, and control the exact length of the leash. Long lines are difficult on hiking trails, where sticks can get caught and your dog can run back over the line and get it knotted. I recommend just always keeping the flexible locked and adjusting so your dog always has the *correct* amount of slack without the leash dragging. Then you can use the environment to your advantage as a reward, and build positive experiences on leash safely.",

The dog still needs to go out and pee, but I can't walk far and he wants to go farther than 6 feet. I'd like to see anyone try to manage a long line in one hand and a crutch in the other!\n\nFlexis are excellent tools for decently trained dogs and owners that pay attention. They just get a bad rap because they're rarely actually paired with those things lol",

Can\u2019t say his recall is the best ever, but - there was a time when I could not take him to a park or around any other dogs he would just go nuts for fun. Never aggressive- he just wanted to play.  Even got basically told not to continue with basic level agility training until he is older because the other dogs were such a big distraction for him. \n\nSo I took him to dog camp- at a facility with about 20 other dogs.  After a couple of visits, he calmed down around them- dogs are old hat. And now, at age 2, and after multiple day visits and 2 vacation boards, he will still play when they engage and he wants to- but he can also walk right by them and not get distracted. Not much interest in them; they are boring!  Lol",
