    "selftext": "I'm working through an odd situation with our 12 year old Puli and our 17 month old son, and could use some advice.\n\nThe dog and the kid are, for the most part, well socialized together. The downstairs is the de facto kid and dog play area, and they get along great with no signs of anxiety or aggression from the dog (and we make sure that the child does not exhibit any rough or overly unpredictable behaviors towards or around the dog). Same if the child is walking around on the second floor. We go for walks or play in the backyard with no issues. When the kid is in his play pen or high chair on the main floor, also no issues.\n\nThe moment the child is walking free on the main floor, our dog follows him and barks at us until we put him back in his pen or take everyone downstairs. We have been trying to fix this by getting the dog to sit on his mat and feeding him treats while the child is walking around on the main floor, but even when this is successful to stop the following and barking the dog is visibly stressed, trembling and whining the whole time.\n\nThe other issue is that having the Puli go to his spot isn't practical at this stage when it's only one adult in the house - since the child also needs monitoring. In these situations we have started putting the dog upstairs with a challenging toy/treat (like a kong with peanut butter) and closing the main floor baby gate. The dog will usually ignore the reward to stare at us from the landing, shake, and whine.\n\nAs the toddler gets older he will eventually not need the play pen and will have run of the house, so we are trying to correct this behavior while we can still expose the dog to the antecedent in short, manageable chunks.\n\nAny advice regarding our game plan would be extremely appreciated.\n\n",

I\u2019m a professional behavior consultant and work on dog/baby programs with challenging dogs. \n\nI would suggest working with a certified behavior consultant that specializes in kids, I can confidently recommend my friend and mentor, [Pooch Parenting](https://poochparenting.net/). \n\nIf you can\u2019t actively work on your dog and the behavior with son, then have the dog put away behind a barrier. I would also suggest considering the use of [behavior meds](https://www.drjensdogblog.com/behavior-medication-first-line-therapy-or-last-resort/) to reduce stress and anxiety around your son. \n\nI would not want your Puli to rehearse this behavior towards your son. \n\nLet me know if I can help further.",
