    "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9 and I have a newly 1yo German Wirehaired Pointer we got at 8 weeks old from a breeder across the country. He\u2019s always been high energy, but after a hip dysplasia diagnosis at 8mo his activity is limited to regular walks and lots of mental exercises (enrichment toys, food puzzles, regular clicker training sessions, etc.). He is so smart and takes to new tricks well but he\u2019s stubborn as hell and a scaredy cat. He\u2019s always guarded his food and toys to some degree, something we typically ignored and didn\u2019t address directly at the advice of a trainer.\n\nFast forward to last fall when he was diagnosed with hip dysplasia and everything changed. No more dog park, no more morning runs, weekly PT, pain management meds, a million vitamins and supplements, and positive-reinforcement-only training methods later and his reactivity only seems to be getting worse. He was neutered last week and even on a bunch of pain meds the next morning he bit my fianc\u00e9 in the face while attempting to secure his cone, requiring 11 stitches in his upper lip. It\u2019s not the first reactive bite to break skin, but exponentially worse than anything he\u2019s done before and was completely without warning (no growling or snarling).\n\nHas anyone ever come back from something like that with training/medication changes/behaviorist help? We\u2019re working closely with our trainer, our vet, and working on a behaviorist consult but we\u2019re both feeling pretty hopeless that our guy will ever be safe to be around, let alone a normal dog. Really looking for some hope that our efforts aren\u2019t all futile.",

            "body": "A) see a *board-certified veterinary* behaviorist: DACVB.org. You need qualified professional help for the medical and behavioral components. Be ready to travel since there are only about 90 in the world. Do this asap because dogs reach social maturity at ~3yo and some types of aggression can intensify as they move toward this developmental milestone. (Think of human teenagers who behave impulsively and recklessly and why people can\u2019t get rental cars or hotels until 25yo, but also that people who behave in this manner may not change as adults.) You noted an increase in aggression around adolescence at 1yo which tracks with typical timeframe of onset or exacerbation. \n\nFind an IAABC credentialed consultant (CDBC) to support you for behavior mod: IAABC.org/en/certs/members. If you need a recommendation elsewhere, comment a rough detail of your location and I can help you find someone.\n\nB) A bite requiring 11 sutures isn\u2019t an inhibited bite. It is very uncommon that you get a dog who has never aggressed and then abruptly the first time lands a label 3-4 bite without lower-level warnings (stiffening, growling, snapping). Generally speaking, we see this most commonly in dogs who have been punished for aggressive displays, which suppresses the behavior but does not actually change their emotional response. Therefore, if they are placed in the same circumstances or further pressed but know that lower-level warnings are likely to elicit punishment, they are forced to endure whatever is happening until the point at which they cannot tolerate it any more and then they respond more intensely.\n\nYou note that after the diagnosis of hip dysplasia \u201ceverything changed\u2026 positive reinforcement based training only\u201d which suggests that this was previously not the case. If you haven\u2019t already, stop all punishment (verbal, physical, shock collar, prong collar, choke chain, alpha rolls, etc). Dogs trained with confrontational methods are more likely to bite their owners. \n\nC) B) He has also had a long time of practicing aggression (at least resource guarding per your post, but I suspect more given the \u201cthis isn\u2019t the first bite to break skin\u201d) which means you are working against greater history of rehearsal.\n\nD) You describe him as \u201ca scaredy cat\u201d which suggests there are other behavioral concerns apart from this episode of aggression.\n\nI outlined the above to emphasize that there are multiple factors here that need to be addressed if you are serious about working to improve his comfort and the safety of everyone in your home. I am proud to say that in my practice we are able to make significant progress with many dogs and their owners but outcome will always be influenced by your ability to implement the behavior modification plan, his response to medication (if indicated and used), and the ability to manage other concerns like hip dysplasia that are likely to influence his behavior (pain \u2014> more likely to be defensive).",

                    "body": "Thank you for this.\n\nA) Our vet is in the process of scheduling a vet2vet consult with a board certified behaviorist in our area. She doesn\u2019t have availability to see/consult with us, but agreed to consult with our vet. Our trainer is also listed as a credentialed consultant on the website you suggested.\n\nB) You\u2019re also correct, our training methods were not always positive reinforcement only. We have cats and if he ever got too rough playing with one of them he was spanked or given a nose boop, but it was NEVER to inflict pain and was meant to interrupt and discourage the behavior. We tried the shock collar literally one time when he was 6mo and he didn\u2019t even seem to notice the shock, so we took it off of him and never used again.\n\nD) He\u2019s anxious for sure. He startles at loud noises, easily gets overwhelmed with lots of noise or people. But the part that doesn\u2019t make sense to me is that he has been socialized. Prior to his diagnosis we were at the dog park every single day, went to Home Depot so many times I lost count, would go with us to the beer garden in a park near our house and he was always friendly toward strangers but now he\u2019s fearful/aggressive toward them too and is muzzled anytime he\u2019s around strangers.\n\nOur regular vet is concerned by aggression this severe in a dog with medical issues and I\u2019m struggling to see clearly whether euthanasia is our only option. Neither of us want that to be the case, but we also don\u2019t want to risk someone else getting hurt or for it to get even worse. We don\u2019t know how to start over and I\u2019m hoping someone has experience that might show us there could be another way forward.",

It\u2019s a useful safety precaution, but it\u2019s just a band-aid because it doesn\u2019t do anything to address *why* he is showing aggression toward them (probably fear-based). It doesn\u2019t change his *emotional* response to that stimulus, only hinders his ability to bite.\n\nYou NEED to avoid exposure to unfamiliar people in the home and on walks. If you have guests, put him in a separate room behind a closed door BEFORE you answer the door. Walk in places you are unlikely to see people \u2014 retention ponds, cemeteries, parking lots after hours, etc. Disconnect your doorbell if you can and have visitors text or call when they arrive. Put up window film (like frosted glass, not opaque) on front-facing windows so he cannot practice aggressing towards people seen outside. This is very reinforcing for territorial (and sometimes fearful) dogs.\n\n\nContinued unstructured exposure to triggers (ie being around people or watching visitors come in, despite being muzzled) will perpetuate his defensive responses. It also lets him practice fearful and aggressive behavior, and what you practice you get better at. Even if he does not get to bite someone, he is probably still being reinforced for aggressive behavior because if he barks, growls, runs toward, jumps on, muzzle punches, or snaps at someone, they are instinctively going to flinch, stop, or back away. Even if this is just for a second (or more distant, like he barks and growls at a person across the street and they continue walking off), he gets reinforced for the aggressive threat and learns it is effective in preventing or stopping an unwanted interaction. So, the next time he is faced with the choice of avoidance (not possible in your home or on leash) or aggression, he is more likely to choose aggression. You MUST throw a wrench in this process and interrupt that cycle by managing exposure.\n\nHe is young and socially immature so it is good you are seeking help now. You may be more able to shift his behavior toward normalcy while he is developing.\n\nGood luck, I know this is a difficult situation. He is certainly not the only dog with these kinds of behavior problems and I am happy to say that many like him DO achieve significant improvement. You clearly care about him to be posting here and pursuing the level of help you are, so that\u2019s a good foundation.",

                                    "body": "Just to add about the muzzling. I muzzle my pup anytime we are out or anytime I think he may be exposed to something I don\u2019t have control over (think the vet). In public we train and do LOTS of counter conditioning and he almost never gets to the point of a reaction because I use lots of management as needed. The muzzle is mostly if let\u2019s say he pulls me and I lose the leash or if someone comes and tries to pet him or if there\u2019s an off leash dog. Accidents happen and management fails but the muzzle is a back up and only that. He has only needed the muzzle when management has failed or off leash dogs and that has happened maybe a few times in the past year. Idk if he would\u2019ve bitten them but we use it as precaution. If you\u2019re using it for guests in the house, work with a trainer and guests shouldn\u2019t be in the house or he shouldn\u2019t be near them unless he is at that point. So maybe you\u2019d use it once you believe he\u2019s fully comfortable with them but just in case. Not as a means to \u201cjust let them in the house, he\u2019s muzzled and can\u2019t hurt them\u201d. That\u2019s not what muzzles are for. They\u2019re back up only. You need to do your best with management to get to a point where you are only having reactions less than once a month and even less than that in the future. It\u2019ll take time but you got this \u2764\ufe0f also for muzzles, use big snoof muzzles or Mia\u2019s muzzles (google them!). Baskerville muzzles are NEVER appropriate for use. They aren\u2019t nearly as bite proof as needed and they don\u2019t allow pant room which is dangerous to the dogs health. I hope this helped.",

Ignoring this behavior is reinforcement that it's okay, and when your dog experienced a perceived threat, its reaction was in line with what you've reinforced.\n\nYou have a high-drive breed, which means high energy. Training, both around the reactivity as well as channeling its natural need to have a job, is going to take a lot of work and effort. First, decide whether you're up for it - including the commitment it'll take from you and your family, as well as the risk you'd be taking on, given the dogs history of reactivity.\n\nSecond, if you're going to go forward with this, get a better trainer. Any trainer telling you to ignore food or toy reactivity should be questioned pretty thoroughly, and when you get advice like that, I'd immediately seek out second opinions. I'd strongly recommend working with a specialist trainer - this isn't a puppy-boot camp level issue; you need someone who specializes in dogs with physical issues and a history of bite reactivity.",

For example, increased handling which is not only irritating, but may also cause legit pain if you twist his limbs in a certain way. Vets will often palpate areas which are tender and painful as part of their examination. Hence as a defensive mechanism to wanting to not hurt, he is pre-emptively biting to make the scary painful humans go away.\n\nWhen a dog bites in reaction to intense fear or pain, all the normal conventions about bite inhibition go out the window. At this point the dog thinks that he's fighting for his life. If he was normally showing good bite inhibition before the injury, then i would say that there would be a chance for rehabilitation (via counterconditioning)  once the pain/ fear is taken care of. \n\nHowever if your pup has always bitten hard (even before the injury) and never acquired bite inhibition as a puppy, then statistically this is a harder thing to fix. I have yet to come across a dog that has never acquired bit inhibition as a puppy, be able to regulate his bite later in adulthood.\n\nAs suggested in the other comment, if able, please consult a veterinary behaviorist who would be able to instruct you.",

If a dog is in pain or feels physically not quite up to par, they can feel vulnerable which might make them a little more defensive, it might explain why he's scared and reactive. \n\nI belong to a Facebook group for behavioral euthanization. This group is a godsend to people who are suffering with a dog that is out of control.  It's absolutely devastating to listen to what people are going through.  \n\nYou should definitely consult a veterinary behaviorist.  If the problem is pain, perhaps it's not managed well enough. If the problem is neurological, then you may be in a very difficult position.  \ud83d\udc94",

Everything was good until he got a herniated disc in his back that paralyzed him briefly, with subsequent cage rest for roughly 8 weeks.\u00a0\n\nHe became very aggressive after this injury. Started resource guarding and would at times bite us out of nowhere. We\u2019re not novice dog owners so obviously did all the stuff that\u2019s recommended\u2014worked with an animal behaviourist, behavioural modifications and training, made sure he was not suffering from any additional injury, water therapy, medications, etc.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s been about 9 years since his behavioural issues started and we\u2019re at a stage now where we know his triggers and body language and manage around that. We don\u2019t take chances with visitors, we have a custom-made muzzle for high stress situations, and he\u2019s on a couple medications for anxiety/aggression and chronic pain. It hasn\u2019t been easy and honestly there are days that he **really** tests my patience, but it\u2019s been manageable.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t think true reactive/aggressive behaviour such as this ever goes away. All you can do is learn to live with it without hurting your dog and yourself.",

            "body": "first, make sure the breeder is aware of this. Consult at least 1-2 additional vets to discuss if surgery (THR or FHO) is a better option; for a dog so young, conservative treatment may not be the best choice because he\u2019s likely still in pain and hip dysplasia will never go away without surgery. a lifetime is a long time to undergo constant PT, meds, etc, and not be able to do all the things one enjoys. Find a new trainer that doesn\u2019t ignore behaviors.\n\nsecond, he doesn\u2019t sound truly aggressive, just poorly trained and in pain. A bite is never good, and he does have a bite history from what you said, but this wasn\u2019t exactly without cause: he\u2019s in pain (even with meds) and was jostled around with a scary thing on his head. Not an excuse, but it wasn\u2019t an antagonistic bite from nowhere, and it makes me wonder what instigated other bites and how they were managed.\n\nThird, it is ok to consider BE. it does not make you a bad person. Dogs are family but at the end of the day, they\u2019re dogs, not children. It\u2019s great to do what you can but it\u2019s also 100% ok to not want to give up your life, happiness, peace of mind, etc for an animal.\n\nfor context, my now 1.5YO GSD mix had severe hip dysplasia and got THR on one hip at 9 months old. He\u2019s still fear aggressive, needs a lot more work, and will never be a people-lover, but his behavior significantly improved after surgery. It\u2019s so much easier to train (and discipline) a pain-free dog. Weirdly enough dogs are much more responsive to instruction when not in pain (/s in case it isn\u2019t obvious). I still have mixed feelings toward my dog, but he went from a hopeless case to \u201cthere\u2019s a possibility I could have friends over in the next 6 months without him barking his head off or me worrying he\u2018ll bite them the whole time\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how bad your dog\u2019s hip dysplasia is, and by no means is surgery a quick or easy fix, but it could definitely be a game changer. However, the caveat is you won\u2019t know unless you go through with it and THR is wildly expensive and almost never covered by pet insurance. I wouldn\u2019t blame you at all if you decide it\u2019s too high a cost to consider.",

We just started with our trainer in December after meeting with 2 others, so I think it\u2019s just been a lot to address at once but we do plan to stick with her.\n\nThe orthopedic vet who diagnosed hip dysplasia said that his hip dysplasia was very profound in one hip and really mild in the other, but we\u2019ve seen so much improvement since we started weekly in September. As I\u2019m sure you know, it\u2019s so hard to determine how much pain he\u2019s in for these working breeds. He would run full speed for days if I let him, regardless of how much he hurts. We were told to try to wait until 5-6yo for surgery because of his lifespan and the life of the components. We do have pet insurance and it would be partially covered, but my fear is that things would still not improve.\n\nThere are also certainly some training issues. Googling what to do for aggression and resource guarding got us in this mess in the beginning, but we course corrected immediately after we consulted with a trainer and it\u2019s escalated so quickly despite following their advice.\n\nThank you for also validating us considering BE. We love him so much it hurts to even think about, so it\u2019s absolutely a last resort. Our vet was the first to say it, and I couldn\u2019t imagine if he\u2019d bitten anyone else.\n\nI hope your GSD continues to improve.",

I don\u2019t want to push that angle too much because I\u2019m no vet and you say he\u2019s improving, but younger dogs recover quicker and easier, and there\u2019s less damage overall if it\u2019s done early on. Re: component life, at least where I am they basically use the same material as they would for humans so they told me that barring other complications, the parts would outlive the dog.\n\nDogs don\u2019t show pain unless it\u2019s bad, so your dude may be in more pain than anyone realizes. my dog was happy to run around even when he was actively dislocating his hip and could barely walk, and sadly for him the pain was just a normal part of life so he had no idea it could just\u2026not hurt. now we\u2019re mostly dealing with training away what I did wrong before/during/after surgery, so hopefully by the end of this year I have a certified good boi.\n\ngood luck to you!",

We\u2019ll definitely pursue a second opinion on surgery.\n\nThe orthopedic vet who diagnosed his hip dysplasia actually commented that his presentation was uncommon because he didn\u2019t alert to joint manipulation during the physical exam. He alerted during the rectal exam when he pushed on his spine. So the vet actually thought it was spinal impingement or some sort of infection (both of which were ruled out).
