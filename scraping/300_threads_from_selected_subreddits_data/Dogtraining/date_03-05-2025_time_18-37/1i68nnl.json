    "selftext": "Ive always had cats and dogs growing up mostly cats but ive never had any issues with my moms dogs and the cats (they were cockier spaniels), the problem is recently around less than a year ago i went thru a very traumatic experience and someone recommended i get a dog, i thought long and hard and we decided to rescue a husky from the shelter. They reassured me she was fine around cats however when i took her home she had this prey drive thats almost hard to control sometimes. At this point weve gotten her to be able to go on walks without chasing animals but as for my living situation i recently found her old owner that abandoned her at the shelter, she told me that when they owned her she killed their roomates cats. I love my yuki shes not a bad dog, i dont want to abandon her again i rescued her so she wouldnt end up back there, but i also love my cats and ive had them first, maybe i made a rushed mistake but i dont want to rehome any of them if theres anything i can do about it. As of now my dog has her own setup and space in our garage/yard while the cats stay inside. I dont want to risk the lives of any of my cats but i would love to help my dog, she just wants to play and doesnt know her own strength. ",
