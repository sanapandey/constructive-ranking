    "selftext": "I need to vent and I need some advice. Walked my dog on a trail in a forest near my home, and the only people who use this trail during winter are dog owners. Since there are no other people/kids there that the dogs can bother, everyone has their dog off leash, which is legal in my country. Every time I go there with my dog we meet several other dog owners with dogs off leash, and the dogs say hello and maybe play a few seconds/minutes. Usually everyone I meet is really friendly, smiling, saying hello, talking to the dogs.\n\nToday I met a couple with a dog, and they were in their 70ies I guess (me female in my thirties with a six year old golden retriever) They had their dog unleashed, it was walking like 10 meters in front of them, playing with a stick and rolling around in the snow. For me, this is a signal that its ok for me to let my dog run over and say hello and play with their dog. (If their dog was on leash, I would definitely put my dog on leash too). The dog saw my dog and came running, and they start playing, but then the man starts screaming something at his dog, I couldn\u2019t hear what, but it was clear to me that he was angry. But the dog was occupied with playing with my dog, and didn\u2019t care. He screamed and yelled at his dog, and eventually he gets his dog over to him, and screams at the dog to walk beside him, which is impossible since the dogs were playing. He still didn\u2019t put on a leash.\u00a0\n\nMy dog is at this point interrupting his attempt to make his dog walk beside him, because the dogs were still playing. And to be honest I kind of froze because I was so shocked by his behavior, so I didn\u2019t know if I should call my dog (but then his dog would follow), or just let them finish playing (my dog gets tired of playing after 10-20 seconds and then he comes to me). I also didn\u2019t want to walk over to the angry guy and get my dog, because honestly the guy scared me a lot, so I wanted to walk away because then I know my dog follows me. But before I could do anything, the guy screams at me in a really angry voice, same voice he was using with his dog, \u00abGET CONTROL OVER YOUR DOG\u00bb. I was really shocked. How can people be so rude?!\u00a0\u00a0For the record, I do have control of my dog, and I never let him run up to dogs that are on leash, and we do train a lot on walking past other dogs on leash, so thats no problem for my dog. But on this specific trail all dogs are unleashed, and all dogs play with each other. How was I supposed to know that his dog was not allowed to play with other dogs?! I mean, why did he have his dog unleashed if it wasn\u2019t allowed to play? Why did he start screaming at his dog to walk beside him while it was playing with my dog? His dog was just as eager to play as my dog, so I dont get why he was so rude to me. What would you guys have done in this situation? I go over and over it in my head, but I dont know what else I could have done. How could I know that he was angry and that his dog was allowed to be off leash but not allowed to play? His behavior breaks with the \u00abunspoken rules\u00bb among dog owners on this trail.\n\nHis screaming made me kind of upset, so I said to him in a calm voice \u00ab its allowed with unleashed dogs here\u00bb, and at this point his wife turns to me, just as angry as the husband, and screams \u00abTHATS NOT THE POINT\u00bb. I was dumbfounded. Out of nowhere I stood there being yelled at by 2 angry old people. I guess she ment that the point was that my dog interrupted them training their dog. But how on earth would I know that they were training when they didn\u2019t say anything? If they had stopped, walked to the side, put their dog on a leash, I would immediately put my dog on a leash too.\u00a0\n\nWhy are people so rude? If they didn\u2019t want their dog to play with other dogs, why bring an unleashed dog somewhere where all dogs play? And who yells at a golden retriever, for crying out loud?! I was totally dumbfounded, and I just said to them \u00abYou are so angry. You can\u2019t talk to other people in that manner\u00bb, and then I grabbed my dog and I just ran! Lol. I didn\u2019t want to engage in a fight with this angry old couple.\n\nThis encounter ruined my day. Maybe I misunderstood the situation and that I did do something wrong, I don\u2019t know, but still there are so many other ways to react than to scream at strangers like they did to me.. If it were me, I would be nice even though the other dog interrupted my training. And they way he treated his poor dog, it was horrible to watch. And having both him and his wife being rude to me made me feel so small and feel like a really bad dog owner.\u00a0\n\nThanks for reading, I just needed to get this out of my system.\u00a0",
