    "selftext": "I have a 1.5 year old Maltese shih tzu mix. I am hard of hearing so have been training him to alert when someone is coming to our door/ringing our doorbell in case I don\u2019t see the alert on my phone. He\u2019s done amazing at this and his training worked great, but maybe too great. Now whenever we watch tv I\u2019m noticing the sounds from the tv like car doors opening/shutting, door knocking, etc is making him alert me. Is there any way to help him differentiate real life and tv? Or is this just a \u201ccan\u2019t have it both ways\u201d kind of thing? Thank you! ",
