    "selftext": "I know there is alot of posts about this on this subreddit and I apologize in advance.  \n  \nI\u2019m reaching out because I feel uncertain and desperate about my 6-month-old pitbull. I live in a small apartment complex, and despite my best efforts to train him, I\u2019m struggling with a specific issue that could lead to problems with my neighbors\u2014or even my living situation.\n\n**Background:**\n\n* **Working from Home:** When I first got my puppy, I worked from home, giving me plenty of time to train him. I started by crate training him for short periods, gradually increasing the time. Over time, he got used to it and tolerated the crate without much fuss.\n* **Sleeping Habits:** At night, he has no trouble settling down. He might whine a bit initially when I put him in his crate, but he always falls asleep quickly and sleeps through the night with minimal interruptions.\n\n**The Issue:**\n\n* **Crate Anxiety When I\u2019m Gone:** The main challenge is when I leave the house. When I worked from home, I occasionally went to the office for a few hours and would leave him in his crate. However, he never seemed to settle during these absences, and now that I\u2019m back in school, I need to leave him alone for 3\u20135 hours each day.\n* **Current Situation:** During this time, he barks and howls uncontrollably, which is upsetting my neighbors. I\u2019m worried that if it continues, I could get complaints or even face eviction. In the morning, he\u2019s usually fine for the first hour or so, but after that, it\u2019s almost constant barking and howling.\n\n**What I\u2019ve Tried:**\n\n* **Frozen Kong with Wet Food:** I\u2019ve given him a frozen Kong with wet food before I leave, but he barely touches it while I\u2019m gone. He devours it when I\u2019m home, but it doesn\u2019t seem to help with the barking or howling.\n* **Bones:** He loves chewing on bones, but only when I\u2019m home. He shows no interest in them when I leave the house, even though he\u2019ll happily chew for hours if I\u2019m around.\n* **Baby Monitor:** I\u2019ve set up a baby monitor that allows me to talk to him through the camera. This seems to calm him down briefly, but I can only use it between classes, and the relief is short-lived.\n* **CBD Oil/Adaptil:** I\u2019ve tried CBD oil and Adaptil, but I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re making a noticeable difference.\n\n**Additional Info:**\n\n* **Mental Stimulation & Exercise:** He gets plenty of mental stimulation, and he\u2019s walked and run daily. He also gets a lot of attention when he\u2019s out of the crate.\n* **Crate Use:** I\u2019ve seen concerns online about leaving him in the crate for extended periods, but he seems content to spend time in his crate even when I\u2019m home. He occasionally chooses to go in there on his own. The issue only seems to arise when I\u2019m not at home.\n\n  \nI have also considered not using a crate during the day but even when I leave to go outside he cries and barks at the door so I'm not sure if this is a good option. This is the only problem I cant seem to fix with him, every other area in training has gone very well but I cant seem to make any progress on this.",
