    "selftext": "My dog has recently been diagnosed with diabetes. What led to this diagnosis was excessive urination and water consumption, and by that I mean the dog was no longer able to hold their urine for more than 5 hours and was drinking in excess of 1 gallon of water at a time. \n\nWell the medical issue has been resolved the indoor urination persists, and I believe it is because the dog has learned it is acceptable to urinate in the house. I am unsure of how to train the dog to alert us, like they used to do, when they need to go to the bathroom overnight. Any other time of day the dog notifies us when they need to go to the bathroom like they used to. Most of what the wiki talks about involves catching the dog in the act and that is difficult to do as I am asleep when this happens. ",

                    "body": "Health note: this behavior began due to a medical issue that has since been resolved.\u00a0\nReinforcement: I cannot reinforce positive or negative responses to the behavior because it happens when I'm asleep\u00a0\nPrevention and management: I don't know how to prevent or manage behavior that happens when I'm asleep\u00a0\nSchedule: I take the dog out before I go to bed. I wake up to house urination regardless. Given The drastically smaller size of the urine puddle in comparison to the size of the urine puddles that were occurring before the medical issue was diagnosed, one can only assume that the issue is no longer related to an urgent need and instead brought about by a learned behavior.\u00a0\nConfinement: confining the dog to our bedroom at night does prevent the house urination, however I would prefer to stop the learned behavior so that on nights that I forget to put the dog in the bedroom with me I do not have to worry about indoor urination.\u00a0\nSupervision: I cannot watch the dog while I'm asleep. The behavior only occurs while I'm asleep. Not literally exclusively when I am asleep, but during hours that most people are normally asleep.\u00a0\nSubstrate preferences: dog is preferring to urinate on the hardwood floor\u00a0\nNew location: it's not a new location\u00a0\nVerbal cue: I cannot provide a verbal cue when I'm asleep\u00a0\nCleaning up accidents: I'm not asking for instruction on how to clean up the accident I am capable of doing that\u00a0\nResponding to accidents: I cannot immediately respond to an accident that occurs while I'm asleep\u00a0\nGetting my dog to communicate: at any other time of day my dog knows how to communicate with me to go to the bathroom. It is only at night time that the dog urinates in the house\u00a0",
