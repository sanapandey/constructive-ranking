    "selftext": "I've had my dog, a rescue, for over a year now, and she is absolutely woderful with people, listens very well and is just an all around chill gal, with cats, birds, hedgehogs you name it she is friends with them instantly.  \nHowever we have a LOT of trouble with other dogs, no matter what the situation, she presents very agressively, lunges barks growls like her life depended on it if a dog is coming closer, as soon as they start going the other way she is okay with them agian. With friends dogs we have tried on and off leash, all the same. If she is off leash and the other dog is too she runs up barking lunging at them and when she is about 2 meters away starts crying and running away as fast as she can, she doesnt actually ever follow through with the threats. I think she is extremely afraid of dogs for some reason and wants to scare them off but I am not sure. But as soon as they can check eachother out with a dog she is instantly friendly with all dogs we've tried with but she is super scary up until then so of course its not an easy to thing to deal with on walks, since people of course dont know that she is not just a killingmachine. On/off leash makes no difference at all for herthe kind of dog doesnt matter either, if it's a dog, she needs to fight to scare them off.\n\nFor about 8 months now we've been doing tricks when another dog comes around sit on the side of the road and try to do a few tricks and I can distract her with that if they dont come too close, but still she is not getting any better, even when we befreind all the dogs I know, she loves them all but appears to not have made the connection that actually maybe most other dogs are just like those dogs she's friends with.\n\nI dont know what to try at this point but I really want to have her be a bit more friendly with dogs not just survive the walks, we can do that, I can also pick her up shes okay with that we can walk but I'd actually like to be able to walk with her withour worrying so much about scaring someone.\n\nAny helpful tips are welcome, I really want to try to train her to be okay with other dogs as much as possible, there are a lot of spots around here where people walk dogs off leash and it's pretty nice but I have to look out all the time, not so they dont attack my dog but so we dont scare the hell out of someone.",
