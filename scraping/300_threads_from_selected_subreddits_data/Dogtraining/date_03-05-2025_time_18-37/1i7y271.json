The owner kept him kenneled 24/7 and was never home. She did not make time to go home and walk him so the dog would sometimes spend days in a kennel not being let out. He would piss and poop in the kennel. \n\nThe first thing we tried, since the problem was him going to the bathroom when we weren\u2019t home,was kenneling him. \nI have never seen a dog freak out more in my life. I spent months trying to retrain him in the kennel with zero improvement. \nI\u2019ve tried Positive reinforcement, pairing the word potty with outside, rewarding every time he goes outside. \nWe tried more frequent walks, longer walks, more mental stimulation. \nwhen we had the schedule for it we had routine times. NOTHING has worked. \n\nNow hes peeing while we are asleep. \nHe will tell me when he needs to go when i\u2019m awake (something i\u2019ve also rewarded) \n\nI feel like i\u2019m living in piss. \n\nwe\u2019ve been to the vet to rule out physical problems, We\u2019ve also tried medication for separation anxiety. \n\nHe has specific spots he likes to pee on. \nwhich i clean every time with an enzyme cleaner \n\nIm at my wits end. please help.

I know it would suck to do that at night, but just like a puppy, his subconscious might start to understand that outside is where he does his business only.\n\nDo you have a room in the house that has hardwood or tile that you can babygate him in when you are at work/away? Maybe put down some pee pads. We put our pup in the kitchen with food, water, toys, and his bed and just babygate the entryway. That way, we don't have to keep him in a crate all day while we're at work.\n\nEdit to add: What about trying a different style dog crate? If he's in a wire crate try getting one of those shipping crates and put it next to your bed. Then work on slowly getting him comfortable with being in that one and sleeping in there at night.",

If all physical medical issues (uti, cancer, stones, etc.) has been ruled out you may need to consult a behavioral therapist.\n\nHowever, as another user suggested, you may want to try going back to square one and treating your adult like a puppy. A very structured play, feed, potty, sleep, potty type schedule over a frustrating long duration (it may need to be life long, who knows?) may be needed. You can teach an old dog new tricks if you are very, very consistant, patient and find your dog's motivator (food, play, affection, whatever). You may also try tethering him to you while you are home and restricting him to a bathroom or other easily cleaned floor while you're out.\n\nI understand your use of enzyme cleaners (I tried those too) but I can pretty much gaurentee your dog can still smell the urine. Replacing the flooring (and painting the subfloor to hopefully seal it) is the only way to get rid of the smell after being peed on so many times. Maybe block access to the preferred spots until you can get him more reliable and then replace the floor when you can?\n\nI know how frustrating this problem can be but don't give up, bring a professional and be ready to spend the next 6 months working on this problem. You (and your family) can do this!",

What I personally would do, is lay down treats close to the kennel and eventually inside the kennel. Don\u2019t force him in or near the kennel, just let him explore on his own. If he does get in to pick up a treat, don\u2019t react to it straight away and definitely don\u2019t lock it yet. Just let him do his thing and discover there\u2019s good things in there. Eventually, you can start with closing and opening the door slowly. Just for a second at the start, and build your way up. You can hide treats in there as a distraction.\n\nFor the peeing: those sprays usually don\u2019t work\u2026 If you can, try to block off the areas where he likes to pee so he can\u2019t go there anymore. Just a box or something could do. Excessive positive reinforcement when he does pee outside is really good (my neighbours probably thought I was crazy when they saw me celebrating a peeing dog), and now five years later and fully potty trained, I still verbally reward her when she pees outside (link a verbal reward with a treat, so that you can eventually slow down on the treats but still reward him by saying something). When he pees inside, don\u2019t get angry at him, as much as you want to be. Ignore what he\u2019s done (because you don\u2019t want to reward that behaviour with any type of attention), and try to clean up when he\u2019s not around (you don\u2019t want him to think that \u201coh, they\u2019ll clean up for me anyway\u201d). Try to find any sign in his behaviour that could lead to him needing to pee, and react to that whenever possible by letting him out (you\u2019ll be one step ahead of him and you\u2019ll learn a sign, and he\u2019ll learn that if he does that specific thing, he\u2019ll get to go outside to pee and get rewarded). I\u2019d suggest puppy training pads, but since he\u2019s already mainly potty trained, I wouldn\u2019t take a step back by reteaching him to pee in the house.\n\nMaybe, hopefully, eventually, you can use the kennel to train him to hold his pee throughout the night\u2026 I\u2019ve never had a dog with this type of issue, but I am just trying to find small solutions that could help you.",

Putting him in the kennel guarantees he will pee, even now, so I don't do that. \n\nBest to use positive reinforcement -- treats and high praise for doing his business outside. \n\nLock step positive reinforcement with training him the way you would a puppy. Religiously take him out before going to sleep at night, right after waking up, and right after he wakes up from any nap or gets up from any prolonged period of inactivity. Before and after his every meal. Right before leaving the house. Every 1-2 hours for durations outside of those landmarks. \\*\\*Yes, every 1-2 hours at first.\\*\\*\n\nIt took time but my pup got it and is cured of going in the house. It wasn't a linear fix, and he did have some periods of regression along the way, after he seemed to get it (possibly late adolescence-related, possibly anxiety-related, especially if I did not set him up for success with a walk right before leaving the house and making sure he peed multiple times and final last pee attempts resulted in less than droplets, every time before leaving the house, even if he went out 45 min. earlier and I was only leaving for 20 min.) \n\nHe will get it faster than a puppy, and you're restarting from scratch and undoing some learned behaviors, so please keep expectations in check. \n\nThe frequency sounds excessive, but you can dial it down after you learn his patterns, which takes at least a few weeks. It helped me to write things down. After any mistake, start again at a higher number of preemptive potty breaks. \n\nLastly, give him positively-framed pep talks when preparing for and going outside. I tell mine 'Finn potty-poopy time outside' repeatedly. And after I walked him and am about to leave the house, I briefly remind him 'Finn potty poopy outside later with mom'. Praise sounds like 'good Finn potty-poopy outside' on repeat. And as usual, I visualize these things in my mind when saying them.\n\nYou two can do it!  Good luck!",
