    "selftext": "Hi, \n\nMy wife and I have a 6 yr old Maltipoo who has recently taken up the habit of marking inside. I don't believe he is relieving himself as its a very small amount, usually on a door ajar or frame or occasionally on a flat part of the wall. Prior to this, he hasn't had any issues since he was a puppy. \n\n  \nThe marking is always on the carpeted areas (of course) and the only link I can make to the start of the marking was we had the carpets professionally cleaned around the time it started. We have been in this home for a little over a year, but the carpets were cleaned prior to us moving in with normal vacuuming/spot cleaning in between. \n\nNo major lifestyle changes, our other dog has been with us for about three years and we have no kids so they receive plenty of attention. Typically no longer than 4 or so hours between bathroom breaks. He does LOVE to mark when outside, taking just about any chance he can get to do so. \n\nWe've read a plethora of articles on the subject but they all seem so overwelming and conflicting so just curious if anyone else has had a similar experience with recommendations to correct this behavior! (And of course ways to eliminate any odor we may be blind to..)",
