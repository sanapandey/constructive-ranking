    "selftext": "I known nothing about dogs, i've never owned one, I would also welcome general advice and tips if anyone has any!!\n\n**Problems I Need Help With:**\n\n1. **Barking for Food & Treats** \u2013 He barks non-stop whenever I eat and constantly demands treats.\n2. **Harness Freakout** \u2013 He attacks me when I try to put a harness on him.\n3. **Leash Pulling** \u2013 He pulls so hard on the leash and collar that I worry it will hurt him.\n4. **Chewing Everything** \u2013 He ignores all teething toys and chews on anything else he can find.\n5. **Is It Even Possible to tire out a puppy!?!?!?**\n\n**Background:** I found a cockapoo puppy (estimated 16 weeks old) abandoned in the loading bay of my apartment building. He was filthy, freezing, and barely moving. I took him in, warmed him up, fed him, and got him to a vet the next morning. He was malnourished with a minor infection but otherwise okay.\n\nI\u2019ve now chipped him and gotten most of his shots (just one more before puppy school). He\u2019s an incredibly loving and energetic little guy who follows me everywhere, sits on my desk while I study, and never runs out of energy.\n\n**Why This Is Important:** I\u2019m a university student with a hectic schedule and live alone in a dog-friendly building. I desperately want to keep him, but I need to train him well enough to register him as a support animal so I can take him to class and on campus with me. If I can\u2019t do this, he\u2019ll be alone too often, which isn\u2019t fair to him. (already got the okay from the university - IF hes registered)\n\nAny advice on positive training methods to address these issues would be greatly appreciated. What has worked for you in similar situations?\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n**Full Story for Those Interested:** I found this little guy one evening, freezing in the loading bay of my apartment building. He was filthy, barely moving, and clearly abandoned. He let me pick him up, so I took him inside, fed him, and warmed him up. After a bath, he became much livelier. I made him a laundry basket bed for the night and took him to the vet first thing in the morning.\n\nTurns out he\u2019s a cockapoo, about 16 weeks old. He was malnourished and had a minor infection but was otherwise healthy. Now, he\u2019s chipped and almost fully vaccinated. He\u2019s an absolute menace, but I love him with all my heart. He shadows me everywhere, sits on my desk while I study, and never runs out of energy.\n\nI want to do right by him, but I need to make sure I can meet his needs. Training is my top priority, and I\u2019d love any help or advice!",

Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve already tried and where I\u2019m struggling:\n\n1. **Barking for food/treats** \u2013 I\u2019ve read the wiki on barking and have tried ignoring him, rewarding quiet behaviour, redirecting him with a chew toy, but he continues to bark persistently.\n2. **Leash pulling** \u2013 I\u2019ve tried stopping when he pulls and rewarding loose-leash walking, but he still lunges forward constantly.\n3. **Chewing** \u2013 I have provided a variety of teething toys, but he ignores them and chews on furniture, cables, and shoes instead. **he also LOVES the bitter / anti chew spray. I swear this man would drink it if i let him**\n\nANSWERED:  \n**Harness issues** \u2013 I have not followed the desensitization steps by introducing the harness slowly with treats, i will implement this right away .\n\n**Since I\u2019m trying to train him as a support animal, I want to make sure I\u2019m using positive training methods and addressing these behaviors properly. Any additional guidance would be greatly appreciated!**",
