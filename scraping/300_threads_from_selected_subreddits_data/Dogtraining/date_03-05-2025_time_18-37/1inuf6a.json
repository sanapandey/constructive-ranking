    "selftext": "4 months ago we adopted a 18 month old female golden retriever. What we know of her is she rarely got walked with her previous owner and had little to no exposure to the outside world. When we first got her she was scared of everything outside the house, but she\u2019s much more confident now. The issue we are having is when she\u2019s not engaged and playing with her ball on walks, she bolts off and will only retrace her steps and return when she\u2019s ready. \n\nI would keep her on lead, however she pulls so much so it has pulled me over before, so we\u2019ve tried the slip lead with a loop round her nose, it helps with the pulling but she constantly tries to pull it off with her paws to the point her cheeks are bleeding because she hates it that much. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m solving for first, but we\u2019ve been training her for 4 months, she goes to 1 hour of training every day and then another walk with me in the afternoon, I feel like I\u2019m not making any progress as she doesn\u2019t really listen to me.

            "body": "Yeah it's overwhelming at first especially with a rescue. There is a lot of advice out there but you can't apply everything at once to a new dog that doesn't understand what you want of it. Give yourself a break, remind yourself this is gonna take MONTHS, and  take it step by step:\n\n1 - don't allow your dog off leash ever until she has perfect recall. This is not to be expected yet until she has completed all of the below\n\n2 - if she is pulling you, you need to find a harness that works best. There are a million kinds of options out there, that work for different dogs. The lead you mentioned (gentle leader?) isn't great if she doesn't even know how to walk in the first place. It can damage their neck if they bolt or something. You need to find a secure harness and be in control of the dog. When she bolts or pulls, you do the opposite of what she wants (turn 180 or just stand still until she comes back to you) look up basic leash walk training. You can get harnesses with multiple attachments for more control.\n\n3 - when she is good at walking and not going crazy everywhere (don't worry about training loose leash at all times like some people like to show off, she can sniff and explore as she likes but not be able to pull you over) then get a long line and begin recall training. I don't want to write an essay in this comment so you can look up how to recall train, but it involves a lot of time, patience, and starting very small before you work up. If you want some resource on this let me know\n\n4 - try her out in an outside enclosed area off leash. Continue recall training. Put her in more and more distracting environments until you are confident in her perfect recall.\n\n5 - take her somewhere not enclosed but safe!! Hopefully by this stage you will be besides yourself with pride at your perfectly behaved dog who you can trust will not run off and will come back when called \u2764\ufe0f",
