    "selftext": "Hey guys!\n\nWe adopted a dog three months ago, and she is now a year and a half old. She\u2019s a terrier mix, but we don\u2019t know anything about her past. When we adopted her, we told animal services that my wife and I both work Monday to Friday, from 8 AM to 5 PM, and they said that was common and she shouldn\u2019t have any problems adapting to our routine.\n\nThe first month was pretty difficult\u2014we struggled to leave the house. But over time, we found a routine that seemed to help. We leave classical music playing in the background, a voice memo from my wife (we leave a speaker playing random memos randomly inside of the room while the door is still shut), and give her a Kong, a licking mat, balls, and even bones with treats inside (everything spread all over the living room so she has to do a sort of treasure hunt). She doesn\u2019t cry when we leave anymore, which is great. We also take her for a walk every morning before leaving for work so she gets tired. If we can, we pretty often take her to the dog park for a 20\u2019 chasing with other dogs.\n\nHowever, every day after finishing her treats, she finds something new to chew on\u2014a sneaker, books, or even a plant. We love her, and when she\u2019s with us, she behaves really well and doesn\u2019t do anything wrong (she is overly calm, she barely barks, moves even if there are weird sounds). But at this point, we don\u2019t know what else to do.\n\nHas anyone been through something similar? Any advice would be really appreciated!",
