    "selftext": "I\u2019m trying to get my dog Trixie back from my ex. We had a shared arrangement after breaking up, but she recently decided not to return my dog. I bought her, cared / provided for her, and trained her. My ex doesn't even walk her, but now she's claiming Trixie is hers. I\u2019ve tried to resolve this amicably, unfortunately the only option left is to take legal action to get her back.\n\nI put significant time and effort into training Trixie to be my service dog. I\u2019m wondering if getting a trainer\u2019s professional statement assessing Trixie\u2019s training level could help add credibility to my role as her primary caregiver and trainer, and maybe her role as my service dog.\n\nSince I wasn\u2019t expecting this situation, I have limited documentation. But I do have a couple of videos showing her responding to advanced commands, as well as photos of her accompanying me on trains and buses and some images of her leaning against me, demonstrating her grounding techniques.\n\nDo trainers even provide statements like this, or is it outside their scope? And if they do, what certifications should I look for in a trainer to ensure their statement is taken seriously? \n\nI\u2019d really appreciate any insights or experiences. ",

I\u2019m not looking for training advice, just asking whether a trainer would be able to assess the level of my dogs training from photos / videos and if this could hold weight in a legal situation. Let me know if I should adjust the wording or flair to comply with the rules. Thanks!",

Just take her to court and get your dog back.",
