    "selftext": "I have had my dog for about a year and a half now. She is a 4 year old black lab Sharpei mix. When I first got her she was totally fine riding in the car. Happy to go for a ride. And I loved taking her places. Then randomly 6 months ago she started to get more anxious. She absolutely refused to even get near the car. \n\nShe won\u2019t leave the house out of the front door knowing that the car is in the driveway. Even if we\u2019re just going for a walk in the neighborhood, she doesn\u2019t want to go out the front. It\u2019s honestly become distressing for both of us to try to get in the car. I try to as little as possible but with my work schedule, vet visits, groomer visits we just have to get in the car. I try to make the rides fun for her too. Stopping at dog parks, going for walks, or getting a pup cup so they aren\u2019t always strictly just going somewhere she may not like. \n\nI\u2019ll take any recommendations or help. I have a car hammock, bed, and blanket trying to make it as comfortable as possible for her. I also keep the music low/ faded to the front of the car. Wondering if getting a car crate would be useful? I just didn\u2019t want to spend an insane amount of money on one if she still was going to avoid the car. \n\nI\u2019ve tried some training of slowly approaching the car with treats and not getting in and slowly getting used to it, but then if we have to go somewhere it\u2019s a major setback in the training. I don\u2019t think she has motion sickness as she doesn\u2019t ever seem to get sick in the car. Wondering if it\u2019s a separation anxiety that gets triggered?",
