    "selftext": "I was going to train my friends at-home service dog, but I can't even get to training him first until I fix this. \n\nHe associates trying to give him a treat with trying to catch him, so he either bounds away, barks, or stares at you for a few minutes before walking off to do something else (he does show interest, but repeats mentioned behaviors). \n\nI also can't work on his leash skills without treats, and if I tried to offer him a treat within the same hour, he won't come to go outside (he thinks you're trying to catch him), even if he wants to. \n\nI've tried sitting there with the treat in my hand, and other methods. I also leashed him, but at that point he's more interested in going outside instead of taking treats. He needs basic training first to even listen outside. \n\nTldr; I need help trying to break the association of offering food = I'm trying to trap you. \n\nEdit: Didn't know I needed to clarify since my question wasn't about training him to be an At-home SD. At-home service dog means he stays at home. No pa, 2-3 tasks, and basic training. This behaviour is from the family luring him with things he likes to catch him, so he stays out of my reach as a result. As the tldr states. ",

So I had him back away from the maybe-scary people a few times rather than come too close for a cookie. If you can build the association with \"good boy!\" and \"I get to chase a treat\" that might work.\u00a0",

If I had to grab her to do her nails or something I would leash her, bring her where I needed her and treat her afterwards. \n\nThe other thing that can be helpful is just dropping treats when you walk by. I\u2019d drop one in her food dish, one on the bed she was lying on. Eventually she started seeking me out because she was pretty sure I was just a walking treat dispenser.\n\nBest of luck!",

Literally all day, every second you\u2019re inside, if at all possible.  \n\nEventually he will realize that just because the leash is on doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s going outside, and will stop trying to do that and start to relax.  This may take minutes, hours, or even days depending on the dog.  \n\nOnce he\u2019s going with the new flow, used to being attached to you, now you can start offering him treats.  He can\u2019t run away, so if he doesn\u2019t accept the treat, that\u2019s fine, try again later, live your life, keep him attached to you. \n\nDo this consistently and he will eventually relax and take treats normally.  It could take weeks, but most dogs will make a great deal of progress even by the end of the first day, YMMV. \n\nOnce he\u2019s able to eat treats normally and stay relaxed at your side in the leash, now you can start all sorts of other training with him!

Teaching spin and middle will also be fun and he will find value in being near you. Another training game is putting two leashes on him, one you unclipped and reward, clip it back on, unclipped reward etc. The second leash is just there to give you control in case he tries to take off.
