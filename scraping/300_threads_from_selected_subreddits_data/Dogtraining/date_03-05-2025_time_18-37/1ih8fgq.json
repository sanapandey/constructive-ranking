    "selftext": "Pup is almost 2 years old and definitely calming down a lot. The only thing she gets too excited with is sticks. She gets too overstimulated and then turns her ears off, tries to jump to get at it and won\u2019t give it up. \nI have tried teaching \u2018leave it\u2019 but there doesn\u2019t seem to be a middle ground before she gets way too overstimulated. \n\nIs this a resource guarding behaviour or just over stimulation? My worry is that she\u2019d be on the beach and jump at a child holding a stick or something. \n\nAny suggestions for training this one? Thanks! \n",
