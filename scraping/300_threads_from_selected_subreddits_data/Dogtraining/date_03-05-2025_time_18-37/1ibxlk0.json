    "selftext": "I have 1 year old cocker spaniel that is crate trained . I\u2019ve been trying to train him to sleep outside the crate in our bedrooms . He does not settle at night and will explore . However he does not do this if he\u2019s outside the crate at night in the living room (sleeps through the night) . \n\nScenario : he will be sleep on the couch and the family goes to their bedrooms and we get to the bedrooms, lights off and 5 minutes later he\u2019s off his bed and looking for toys or a shoe but he doesn\u2019t do this if we slept in the living room.  We just put him back in the crate which is in the bedroom and he goes right to sleep since he is a lil busy body . \n\nAny thoughts would be helpful . ",

Settle could be a command since he does know extended stay but I don\u2019t know if that works when the family has dosed off.\n\nCrate training he\u2019s has no issues with the crate or sleeping there . \n\nWasn\u2019t sure what other search term to try .",
