            "body": "I was given a difficult situation with a livestock guardian dog (LGD) who just kept chasing our animals and terrorizing them. Not listening to us. And repeatedly escaping and going on long walk abouts.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHe was supposed to be a trial of a trained LGD and when we told the lady it wasn't working out after a few weeks, she said she wouldn't take him back and to just take him to the pound. I tried to find a home for him to no avail, so I took him to the pound.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThey said they would most likely have to euthanize him if they didn't find a home for him in a couple weeks and they didn't think that was likely. They already had a bunch of dogs and failed LGDs don't move in their experience.\n\n\nI left the pound and brought him back with me. Now I'm doing everything I can do to train him to be a house dog and find a good home for him.",

Due to the sensitive nature it was important to the ethics board to keep a standard guideline of 18 and over. I am so sorry if this caused any distress in your situation it was definitely not the intent and was set up to try and protect. It does not make your story any less valuable.\u00a0",

The dogs can be older than 5 but the experience can\u2019t be more than five years ago. I understand the frustration around this. To keep the study as viewed as an \u201cstrong\u201d study one thing we need to take into consideration is memory and how time might change our memories or experiences. It still does not mean your voice and story are not valuable but to work to make sure that this study does have a chance of making an impact in the world of academia we have to think of how others will come at it and try to attack its validity. I am so sorry if that has made it upsetting. It is definitely not the intent. We are just striving to make sure this study has a chance to make a difference.\u00a0",

I believe it's against their rules to have an outsider doing survey work in the group like this, but you might be able to talk to one of the people leading the group.  They have probably seen and heard about more BE cases than just about anybody.",
