    "selftext": "Our puppy was potty trained at a young age, and after a long battle with GI parasites she has basically no accidents inside. But, she still struggles overnight. We'll let her outside to go potty at about 10:30pm every night and by the time I get up at 7am there is pee and poop upstairs. \n\nWe moved her dinner to 4pm and I thought that helped, but then the past two nights she's had accidents. Is 10:30-7 too long to hold it? Is there something we can do to prevent these overnight accidents?",

Dogs are individuals. 8 and a half hours is a long time. \n\nDoes she have a way to alert you that she needs to go potty during the night and for you to take her out? Being potty trained doesn\u2019t work if she has no way to let anyone know she has to go.\n\nGo back to basics, set an alarm and take her on a potty break during the night. My puppies always need a potty break at night. That\u2019s partly why I have them sleep in my room so once they are potty trained and they whine usually between 2 and 5 am I can take them to the bathroom. Then we come in and go back to bed. \n\nThese breaks should also help her realize how to alert you when she needs to go at night. That she can come get you in the night or ring a bell or do whatever it is you teach her.\n\nWhen dogs age they also frequently go to the bathroom, at about 8 years old my oldest dog started waking me up daily at 5 am to go potty and did till she passed.",

She could have a uti (pee accidents) or a digestive tract issue (unable to retain or digest food/fluids). A vet visit will be needed\n2) some puppies  have training regression around 1 year but I haven't heard of it re toilet training \n3) some of our rescues had accidents if they were left alone too long due to anxiety. Can you check if she's better if she gets to sleep near you (doesn't have to be on the bed with you but you could leave the door open so she can come \"check\" on you to be reassured)\n4) maybe the length of time doesn't agree with her body. (I walk my dog at 10pm and then by 5.45 am she's ready to go out. I can delay it till 6am but she'll be clawing the door)",
