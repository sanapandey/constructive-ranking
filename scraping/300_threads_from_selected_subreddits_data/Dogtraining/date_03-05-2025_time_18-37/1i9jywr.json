    "selftext": "please help.  no dog parks were involved. My 21 pound, 4 year old mini goldendoodle will snap if a puppy or smaller dog is in her face jumping on her and being annoying.  She takes it for a little bit but then she snaps, gets growley, runs after the dog to pin it down.  Doesn't bite or anything.  She did this last night at a bar.  She was happy and fine socializing with dogs. This one dog was going around jumping and annoying the other dogs and they just brush it off, my dog can't brush it off.   If it was a bigger dog in her face, she'd just get growley and show her teeth.  The \"snapping\" though - it's horrible.  I watch her line a hawk but it always happens so quickly. \n\nI\u2019m at a loss.  She is so sweet and loves people and dogs.  Any tips would be appreciated.  I am so anxious about this and want to help her.  ",

If another dog was bothering your dog, you should have either taking your dog and left, or ask the owner of the other dog to please not let your dog bother it..  \n\nMy first suggestion is don't take your dog someplace when there's a very good chance that your dog is going to be uncomfortable. \n\nIf the owner won't take responsibility, then do it yourself. Shoo  the other dog off.  \n\nWhat you describe as corrective behavior. It is entirely appropriate for a dog that has asked repeatedly to be left alone and the other dog is not getting the signals.  In simpler terms your dog is in the right, the other dog is in the wrong. The only thing that will change this up is you doing a better job as the owner to make sure your dog does not have to go this far.",

When you bring a dog someplace, it\u2019s your responsibility to make sure it\u2019s an appropriate situation for them. If you notice the place has an out of control dog, you have to remove yours. We can only control our own actions.\n\nLook for subtle signs that your dog is uncomfortable, well before it starts growling or snapping. This can look like: \n* stiff, still body\n* stiff, fast wagging tail (this is not a sign of happiness or comfort)\n* pinned ears\n* licking lips or yawning\n* shaking off when they aren\u2019t wet\n* staring and stepping toward the dog\n* whale eye, or looking at you for help\n\nThis is when you should step in and remove your dog from the situation.\n\nContinuing to put your dog in a situation that makes them uncomfortable runs the risk of the dog skipping the \u2018nicety\u2019 of growling and snapping, and going directly to fighting. It\u2019s much harder to convince a dog to go back down the ladder once more polite boundary setting has been ignored.",

If you see a dog that looks like they could annoy your dog, I would warn the dogs owner that she dosesn't like \"hyper\" dogs and ask for them to give her space. If the other dog owners are responsible, they should try to keep their dog away from yours. Your dog isn't aggressive, she just doesn't like her boundaries being violated which is fair.\n\nMy dog isn't the same as yours, but in parks he can put a lot of dogs on their back and corrects a lot of puppies that are in his face. But sometimes, there are a lot of poorly socialized dogs who just don't stop. When this happens and I can tell the other dog is going to annoy him, I let their owners know that my dog is done playing and ask them to help break up the play.

Many puppies would have grown up to be much better behaved dogs if they had an adult female teach them manners like your dog does.\n\nHowever, due to how dogs are currently handled and regarded, it isn\u2019t a good idea to let this continue. And the best way to prevent it is for you to be more alert and remove your dog when you see the other dog is being impolite. Preventing her from setting her boundaries with other dogs by trying to train her to take rudeness from other dogs will lead to much more trouble down the road. Even if you manage to train it out of her, she might just snap one day and blow past disciplining straight to proper aggression. Don\u2019t let her interact with puppies and other rude dogs and she will be fine.\n\nJust to give you a little parallel, in the horse world uppity youngsters are purposefully placed into a herd of seasoned mares to teach them manners. There is a lot of kicking involved, almost never with serious injuries. If your dog was a mare, she would be highly sought after for this job - good discipline lessons without injuries are an excellent training tool.

I keep his attention on me and we pass without incident.\n\nThe dogs he is okay with are nonchalant, curious to do a mutual butt sniff and turn, heads low and tail loosely wagging, and they will sniff other things in the environment to show they are not that intense on him.

Do you have to break them up, or is she just quickly pinning and then going about her business?  \n\nIf it's just a quick pin and then both dogs shake it off and return to play, in my (non professional) opinion, it's a correction and they're doing just fine. Some dogs are not socially adept and don't get smaller hints that she is uncomfortable and doesn't like their behavior (like her lip licking, side-eye, dodging, etc) and she may have to escalate to pinning them briefly to get her point across - \"don't do that to me! I don't like it!\" Some even less socially adept dogs will take her pin as an invitation to play, in which case you should remove her from the situation immediately if the other owner doesn't remove their dog first.   \n\nIf she's obsessive/bitey about it, or continues to follow the other dog around and pin them over and over, I would suggest keeping an eye out for the kind of dog you know she will pin and making sure to separate them before they interact one-on-one. Distract them both, get in between them, and let her know she can choose to focus on other things. If the other dog continues to follow her around and bother her, again you need to remove her from the situation. Some dogs are basically always overstimulated when around other dogs and can't help but be insanely rude and annoying. \n\nMoral of the story: just because the other dogs aren't snapping doesn't mean your dog is behaving inappropriately, but if it makes you anxious, you can always remove her before she gets annoyed enough to correct. It's like in humans: if someone does something weird, you may laugh it off at first or change the subject. The fourth time they do it, you might be like \"dude what the fuck stop doing that!\" and if they continue to do it or joke about you after you \"snap,\" they're obviously not someone you want to be around.",

Correcting *your* dog for setting normal boundaries is a fast way to damage the trust you have built, give confusing signals and messages on appropriate behavior, and lead to inappropriate responses like actual aggression.\n\nYou can advocate for your dog in a few ways when another dog is being inappropriate. I typically address the owner of the annoying dog first \u201chey, looks like your dog isn\u2019t picking up on my dog\u2019s signals, can you please call it off?\u201d \nYou can also call your dog to you. Reward with pets and praise, and then relocate or just leave in a super positive way so you don\u2019t create a scenario where your dog feels it\u2019s being punished. \n\nThe biggest issue is that if an owner is allowing their dog to be inappropriate and interact in this way without already calling them off or trying to stop it, it\u2019s very likely the owner isn\u2019t aware it\u2019s problematic or that they simply don\u2019t care. So there\u2019s not a lot you can do to control the external scenarios. Meaning you\u2019re not going to be able to stop their dog nor should you expect the owner to happily receive the message and then make a change. \nMy advice is essentially to just positively exit,  completely taking control of the situation and removing your dog from something that\u2019s stressful for them. \nI don\u2019t do dog parks for this reason and a lot of other trainers agree too. It\u2019s a space that you have very little control over what can (and frequently does) happen.",

Still, I get why it\u2019s stressful for you, especially in public!\n\nOne thing that might help is giving her some space before things escalate. If you notice another dog being overly pushy or jumping on her, try redirecting her attention to you or moving her away for a breather. You could even work on teaching a \u201cplace\u201d or \u201cfocus\u201d command so she has something else to do when she starts to feel overwhelmed.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t beat yourself up! It\u2019s okay for dogs to set boundaries with each other, and not all dogs have the patience to deal with puppies or super bouncy dogs. It\u2019s great that she doesn\u2019t escalate beyond a snap or pinning, she\u2019s probably just trying to communicate in the only way she knows how. With practice, you can help her feel more comfortable in those situations.\n\nYou\u2019re clearly a caring owner who wants to do right by her, and she sounds like a sweet dog overall.
