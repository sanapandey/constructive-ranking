    "selftext": "Hi. \n\nI am planning on moving with my boyfriend soon. I have an 11 year old anxious small dog and he has a very sweet lab/border mix. \n\nMy dog goes insane and is aggressive towards other dogs, very sweet with humans tho unless when I am trying to move him away from barking at other dogs. At this instance, he bit me before when I tried to pick him up. \n\nI don\u2019t believe my boyfriend dog would hurt him unless he bites him and he might bite back. \n\nI am looking forward in hiring a dog trainer to help. \n\nJust wondering if there is any hope considering he is 11\u2026 \n\nBesides that I might need to keep them segregated in the house which seems like a logistical nightmare.\n\nAny suggestions?",
