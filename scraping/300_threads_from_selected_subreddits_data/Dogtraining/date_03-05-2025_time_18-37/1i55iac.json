    "selftext": "I have a 4 year old redbone coonhound mix and a 2 year old brown lab pit mix. Before I had the lab I had my 4 year old and a pit mix who I rescued from an abusive home that I was rehoming. While i was fostering her I found a kitten on the side of the road in a park. I took her in of course and I kept her in a separate room until I was comfortable introducing them. One day we got home and the pit mix got out of her cage and busted out the door to the room and unfortunately harmed the kitten. We ended up rehoming her but I still have trama. I don\u2019t know how my dogs would act they have never been around kittens. I do have a big cage for the kittens when we\u2019re not home they go in there behind a closed door. When they are in the cage we take the dogs in there as a way of slowly introducing them but I\u2019m still not comfortable. I want to be able to have the kittens out with the dogs but I\u2019m honestly traumatized. I trust my dogs I have but I\u2019m having a hard time due to that situation. I am an animal lover and I save animals frequently from situations. And the 2 year old does not like other male dogs but is fine with female dogs. I feel like I\u2019m failing my animals and I do train them they have recalls when they want to listen\u2026 they act like they don\u2019t see the cats when they go into the room and when they go to the cage they sniff the cats noses and walk away. I just need some guidance on how to work on my trust with my dogs and also guidance on how to introduce them without making me feel uncomfortable. My husband stands by the fact he thinks they wouldn\u2019t harm the cats but I just can\u2019t get past seeing that dog and what it had done.. please don\u2019t berate me for getting the cats I am a animal rescuer and found them as bottle kittens by a stop sign in a box. I do want to keep one since I lean toward a cat person.",
