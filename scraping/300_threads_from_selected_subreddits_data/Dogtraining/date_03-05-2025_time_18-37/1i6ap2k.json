    "selftext": "We rescued a dog last August. The rescue we got her took her from an animal hoarder/backyard breeder situation. From what I can surmise, she was fed and mostly healthy but neglected. There were at least 20 non potty trained dog in the home. She was very fearful when we got her, particularly with men (my husband). She was and is extremely patient with my two young kids, which is the main reason we adopted after the foster to adopt period. We assumed she would eventually bond with us and learn to love us like our last rescue did. We have been working with a trainer, did obedience classes, and send her to doggy \u201csocialization school\u201d once a week to help her get more comfortable with other dogs and humans. In many ways, she has turned into a great dog. She is good with obedience, she is non reactive on walks now unless a dog or person invades her space, we can take her almost anywhere now (huge progress considering what limited exposure she had to the world). However, we are struggling with feeling a lack of bond with her. She still barks and growls at my husband at least once a day, but demand barks treats, food, and walks from him (and me too). Our relationship just feels very transactional. She interacts with us when we have food and wants it (very food motivated) or if she wants us to do something for her like take her on a walk (which is actually progress in that she used to not like walks). It\u2019s just that there is minimal affection towards us. Barely ever wags her tail at us, doesn\u2019t seek out pets, not excited to see us when we come home, moves away when we try to pet, looks at us with skepticism. I\u2019ve never had a cat but she seems to fit my (admittedly negative) stereotype of what cats are like. One upside is she is sweet and playful with the kids, although does a ton of play biting. I think she misses having g dogs to play with and so kind of treats them like dogs to play with. My husband summed up the situation perfectly\u2014 with our last dog, there was unconditional love. Our best friend. With this dog, there is \u201cconditional like\u201d on a good day, meaning that if we give her all the things she wants she seems to maybe sort of kind of like us. Our trainer\u2019s main advice is to not give any affection and play hard to get. However, my kids still give lots of unsolicited affection so I feel like that is kind of canceling out our efforts to play hard to get. We had previously been doing tons of treats, good girls, constantly rewarding her for letting us pet her or play with her. Any advice for how to get her to bond with us humans and see us as the source of everything good in life? She is a great dog in so many ways but we are just lacking that incredible dog-human bond that with our last dog was the most incredible feeling/experience of our lives. It\u2019s been 5 months\u2014 will we get there eventually? Should we even consider rehoming to a different home, perhaps one without a man since my husband\u2019s presence seems to put her in a constant state of anxiety/skitishness despite him walking her very day and feeding her all meals? \n\nBtw\u2014 the dog is about a year na some change months old. DNA test showed a mix of 10 breeds with the top 3 being poodle, pug, and spaniel.\n\nWe welcome any advice\u2014 we just want her to let us love her, and want her to love us back eventually.",
