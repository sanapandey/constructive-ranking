    "selftext": "I live in Charlotte NC and don't really have any dog training schools close to my area to go to, so I was wondering about the credibility of these online programs such as CATCH, Karen Pryor, ABI, and academy for dog trainers. I currently work full time at a doggy daycare and love every second of it and I know that working with these animals is what I want to do with my life. Any tips and recommendations of how to get into this line of work would be greatly appreciated. I've thought about finding a mentor but don't really know how I should go about that.",

            "body": "A few years ago, I was in your shoes, eager to learn more about dog training. I started by gaining hands-on experience at local daycares, which gave me valuable insights into canine behavior and body language. To build a solid foundation, I completed the CATCH Canine Trainers Academy program in 2023. I found it quite helpful, and they offer mentor support for the skills assessment. I already had a mentor going in, an honors graduate of the Academy for Dog Trainers. I chose to take the full course with CATCH without a mentor.\n\nAs you know, dog training is a constantly evolving field, with new research emerging all the time. Continuous learning is essential. Even now, I supplement my CATCH training with additional courses\u2014I'm currently enrolled in two. My goal is to attend the Academy for Dog Trainers myself, hopefully this year or next.",

However, after extensive research, I\u2019ve decided to pursue certification through the PPAB instead.\n\nLet me know if you have any specific questions on the program. :)",

No matter which school you choose, you\u2019ll spend a good amount of time on theory, which will be valuable for any certifications you pursue later.",
