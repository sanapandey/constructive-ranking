    "selftext": "I adopted a 3-year-old Jindo mix girl a couple days ago, and we\u2019re on day 2 of 3 of the 3-3-3 rule. The rescue strongly emphasized this and, given that she\u2019s quite anxious, I want to make sure I\u2019m adhering to it.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m finding she\u2019s very much seeking out affection when she\u2019s out of the crate. Her foster said she\u2019s a very sweet girl who loves a good ear scratch, and I\u2019m finding that\u2019s so, but I want to make sure I\u2019m striking a balance between honoring to hands-off approach to the first 3 days and not denying her affection-seeking impulses. We\u2019re meeting with a trainer over the next few days as a requirement of the rescue and will address this all then, but I wanted to put it to the internet first.\n\nSo my question is: How much should I be ignoring those behaviors? Should I be? Or is she establishing a level of comfort that I should encourage?",

            "body": "Could I ask how the rule was described to you and their recommendations? Not to imply they\u2019re somehow wrong, but it might be helpful for clarification purposes! I love that your rescue educated you with this. \n\nTypically in the first 3 days, this is something you\u2019d want to see. If your new dog is intentionally seeking out attention and affection in this way, I\u2019d recommend giving that to her in respectful ways! Consent checks are also great (ex; stopping petting to see if she initiates again) for confidence building. It\u2019s really awesome that you\u2019re going at her pace and not rushing, but you don\u2019t have to withhold attention/affection if she\u2019s seeking it in an acceptable way. \n\nI usually recommend to folks that in the first three days, plan to be at home and create a relaxing, inviting space for the dog to explore and decompress. Allowing them to go at their own pace with seeking out their new humans can be great for confidence building. This is a great time to introduce the first steps for cues like \u201cwatch me\u201d (eye contact on a cue) and \u201ctouch\u201d (target touching the hand\u201d, also for confidence building. Some pups find eye contact and initiating touch to be a little intimidating, so setting up small training sessions that coincide with meal times can help with this; while also promoting bonding, mental enrichment, etc.",

I think it's way more important to focus on expectations, not what you expect of them, but what they can expect of you. What do you want them to know you for? What boundaries do you have? When an anxious dog knows that you are there to help them meet their needs, you've got a good thing going! -E x",

Her little personality is shining through and honestly feel she knows she is home now which is usually at the 3 month mark. Still we are letting her adjust at her own pace and making the boundaries clear. One thing I am still doing is not allowing her to always dictate affection engagement as to not develop any form of separation anxiety and also make my comings and goings in and out of rooms as boring as possible. When she hints that she wants a scritch while I am reading on the sofa, I wait for her to get bored and settle down. After a few minutes of her being calm in her basket, I either get up and sit with her and give a jolly good fuss or call her over. It is a good balance and she has learnt quickly to settle down herself without feeling neglected. Next is trying to mask the sound of the treat cupboard as she tends to teleport under your feet while in there (cold storage room so has our dry goods and hoovers in there too!).\n\n(edit: When I say I ignore her request for affection it is now a 50:50 ratio (previously 80:20)  - maybe sometimes more in her favour as who can resist those big eyes when the head is on your knee! she is such a snuggle bug, she would live on your lap if you let her :D)",

            "body": "We had the same issue with our Jindo when we first got her. Days 1-2 she was very skittish and wary, and even growled/lunged at us when we would go to let her out of the crate. Then day 3 she stopped doing that and started rubbing her body and head on us which looked like she was looking for pets. We consulted our trainer and she said that this was very common behavior and to refrain from giving in and petting her during the first three days to even the first week. \n\nHer reasoning was that your dog is still going to be decompressing and anxious even if she doesn\u2019t show it. And the anxiety may present itself in submissive behaviors such as rubbing her body or head on you and licking you. If you start petting/scratching ears, which are positive interactions WHILE she is still very anxious/nervous, she might end up associating your petting her with her anxiety. \n\nWe actually waited a full week until we would pet her, even when she initiated physical contact and after 3 weeks, we started initiating petting/rubbing ourselves and now she loves it AND she doesn\u2019t come to us immediately for affection when something else triggers her anxiety. She will go to her crate to self soothe.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to discourage her attention-seeking behavior but my advice would to be as sterile as possible in your interactions with her at least in the beginning. Your trainer will likely have more specific advice based on meeting her and seeing where she\u2019s at.\n\nIt\u2019s sooooo hard because she\u2019s probably sooooo cute, but I think ultimately it will be for the better to not give in to the pets.",

            "body": "The only reason I would ask someone not to engage with their dog is if the dog is becoming more anxious or aroused during the interaction. If that were the case, I would ask them to determine how to change the interaction to ease the dog\u2019s anxiety rather than contribute to it. If there is a behavior that you don\u2019t like (like jumping up), you can always interrupt and redirect to the positive solution (sit here instead and get food). But you don\u2019t need to ignore behaviors that you want to see more of. If the attention-seeking seems needy or anxious, perhaps there is more to think about there. If it\u2019s sweet and gentle, no issues! You\u2019re establishing that comfort in each other, just like you said. The first three days \u201crule\u201d is just a reminder that it might take a few days for your new dog to begin to settle in and not be on such high alert \u2014 by day three, they have usually learned to regulate any new stressors and have processed the changes in their environment. It's also about \u201cdecompression,\u201d which means allowing the dog to decompress from past stress and regulate the new stress without adding additional pressure. It sounds like you're doing a great job \ud83d\ude0a. If she was in a foster home, she is probably already a bit adjusted. If you\u2019re hanging and she\u2019s coming up for scratches and pets, that\u2019s great! Like everyone says, practice the consent test to see if she\u2019s still into it. I would also be sure to practice \u201calone training,\u201d whether that\u2019s starting with a gate, separate room, or crate. \ud83e\udd0d",
