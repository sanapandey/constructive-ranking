    "selftext": "I have two chocolate labs, one 7F spayed and one 16M intact. Both trained hunting dogs and have always lived in the same household. My older male dog is a saint, never growls at anyone or anything and never gets annoyed by the younger dog who we have had since she was 9 weeks old. He is in great shape but is obviously in the decline as far as his eyesight, hearing, and just general mobility. He has dealt our younger dog\u2019s puppy-like play (ear pulling, jumping/prancing, barking at, etc) the same way his whole life - pretty much totally unbothered and doesn\u2019t really bat an eye. \n\nLately he\u2019s been bumping into items in his peripheral such as chairs, couches, table legs, etc and can\u2019t hear anyone walking up on him or most general noise. He is fine being walked up on and will startle a little but it\u2019s more of a \u201cope didn\u2019t hear you there\u201d and not a \u201cI\u2019m scared so I\u2019m going to react by being aggressive.\u201d I\u2019ve noticed though that if he\u2019s so much as standing a hair too close to our younger dog, she snaps and snarls at him like he got too close to her without realizing even though she can sense he\u2019s there more than he knows what\u2019s going on since he is hard of hearing and has bad eyesight. I\u2019ve never caught the moment directly as I usually have my back turned or the older dog is on the floor standing and the younger dog is laying on the couch and she feels he walks too close (he likes rubbing up on the couch). It seems to only happen when someone is in the room with them as far as I know. \n\nObviously I feel bad for my older dog because he\u2019s just completely oblivious to what he\u2019s doing and never \u201cfights\u201d back and just walks away a lil scared. I always send the younger dog to her kennel when she displays behavior like this and she knows to go straight there and the door gets closed and give the older one some extra lovin. I\u2019ll let her out after an hour or so and we go about our day. They have always eaten together, go outside together and drink out of the same bucket and have no issue with that. They sleep in separate rooms just so she doesn\u2019t wake him in the morning to eat because he\u2019s a barker. I\u2019d say there\u2019s been about 3 of these instances over the last month and we used to never have this issue. Just looking for some extra training reinforcement ideas to make sure the little one realizes she\u2019s not able to fight him.",

Just simply by one dog getting too close to the other and obviously other than keeping them separated at all times (is not an option - they will coexist) I need solutions to disengage this behavioral mindset from the younger dog so it doesn\u2019t get worse.",
