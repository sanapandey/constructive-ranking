    "selftext": "Hi all. I have a 4 month Border Collie that is very afraid of school buses and garbage trucks. Specifically she seems afraid of the hydraulic sounds.\nI found a YouTube video that plays the sound thinking I would play it at the smallest volume while we play in the house to try to desensitize her. I tried it once but she stopped playing immediately and ran to a corner. The volume was low enough I couldn't even hear it.\n\nMy question is, how do I make those sounds not scary to her? Was my plan a bad plan that will just make her feel less safe in our house or will it eventually lead to a dog who will see that the sound isn't associated with anything that is harmful and will begin to treat it as not important?",

The dogs would go nuts and get really stressed, and this guy was coming home at 2 in the morning so it wasn't great. \n\nI started saying \"truck\" as soon as I heard it, and talking them through it to reassure them like: \"It's ok, it's just the stoopid truck\" (I use 'stoopid' for anything annoying like flies or a particular neighbour). I also began mimicking the brake sound and pairing that with the word truck, and laughing at myself because it sounded so stupid which lightened the mood and they seemed to pick up on that. It took a few nights but gradually they would bark less until they got used to it. \n\nI was really glad it worked because not long after they started doing roadworks nearby and parking all the trucks and heavy machinery across the road. The dogs would bark a bit and then settle because it was all just stoopid trucks lol.",

            "body": "I have a BC mix that was terrified of everything. Sounds, boxes, closets, his own reflection and shadow. At 8 weeks he was just quivering mush, the poor dear. I've done different things, for sounds I ignore his reaction and just remain calm. I allowed him to hide by me and just put mt back to the scary sound or thing. He still barks at the garbage truck, but he recovers quickly. Boxes, I started getting bark boxes... he is totally over his fear of boxes now. He will always be cautious, but he is 2 now and he has gained so much confidence. Socialize, i dont mean other dogs, i mean just the neighborhood. People in hats, old people with walkers. He still thinks that big black dog in the mirror is sketchy, but he is not hiding under the couch. Of course he's half Mastiff and no longer fits under the couch. If the dog is afraid, move back until the reaction is gone. Sit quietly,  play games, do obedience.  Move just a hair closer, repeat. He'll get there. \n\nExpose your pup in a safe environment. The more they trust you, the more confidence they gain. Get them out in a busy environment, but off a bit. Maybe a park by a construction site. You need to flip the script. Don't try to soothe their fears. That actually gets them more worked up. Keep your emotions in check, do not show concern, fear or worry. They WILL pick up on that. My Bear is the first dog I've had that is afraid of fireworks. But he's gone from hiding in the furthest smallest place he could fit, and just shaking, to just barking at them. I'd prefer him to not react at all, but we'll get there. Building their confidence is the best way to alleviate fear reactions. Just remember, when they get it right, praise, praise, praise.",

You can desensitize and counter-condition, but it can be more difficult with an anxious dog, in my experience. \n\nIf your dog is sensitive/anxious, I think teaching the dog to relax would be beneficial and a necessary precursor to desensitization. Dr. Karen Overall's Relaxation Protocol is great. \n\nIt's also important to work on relationship and trust with your dog. If you were to walk your dog past the scary garbage truck or school bus, the dog may learn that you can't be trusted, especially when the dog wants to run away but is prevented from doing so by a leash that you are holding.\n\nIt seems like your dog is hyper sensitive to the sound, so exposure to the triggering sound should only happen when dog is eating high value treats such as steak. Any desensitization training needs to occur when your dog is well under threshold and feels calm and safe.",

            "body": "Oof, collies are great for this type of thing. I have a collie cross and I swear I can play the audio of the first note of the Amazon ring doorbell and he immediately is up to 11 guard dog mode at the door.\n\nI think you're on the right track. It is actually in a way a good thing she is reacting poorly to the audio alone, it means you can work on that away from the real thing. I would be introducing the low audio as you are, WHEN she is already in a good mood, maybe play is occuring or treat time. She will get scared, that's fine, you can see does she snap out of it with continued activity or does she need to reboot. If the latter, take a break, come back and do it again. She's seeing the pattern that the noise goes away, nobody dies. The play before hand is to just give her a help to be less likely to have the strongest reaction.\n\nYou could also introduce the noise just before food, or before a walk. Unless she gets into super fear pee yourself mode (I've never done this with a dog that fearful) consistently hearing the noise, I bet you money that within 2-3 days she will get excited by the noise. The noise means good things. The noise is as good as the word walkies.\n\nOnce she gets ok with the noise I would next put my attention to the authentic noise in real life outside.  You'll probably see a set back as compared to the simulated noise, but hopefully she won't be as bad as before. I had this with a collie afraid of double Decker busses. She would cower when they went past and initially try to pull me back home. It took time, we had some walks we wouldn't see the bus, that would fuel her love of walks for the next time the bus was there. I didn't give her treats although that might distract some dogs. With her I would actually just point out the bus in my excited walkie voice, and encourage a bit more forward momentum in the walk to get to the park. Don't forget if you jog a bit past a collie their instinct will be to chase or get ahead of you, that keeps the momentum and switches away from the scary vehicle a bit.\n\nIf you are really lucky you might hear the real noise outside from your home, that could get you to transition to tackling the real noise nicely. Dump truck outside? Food or treat time. Dump truck outside after a while of that? Where's the leash it's walkie time. \n\nIf you persevere and if your dog isn't deathly afraid, I'm talking severe severe fear. Then I think you can make the noise fear a thing of the past completely. Collies are smarter than most dogs and seem to be able to be more stubborn and neurotic, so it can take time, plus a bit more.\n\nI'll just add I've been in some frustrating situations with them all my life so I will also say it's important not to push too hard to get too emotional yourself. They pick up on all that and it turns a scary situation for them into a scary situation + your owner is annoyed/frustrated so it compounds the fear/anxiety. I'm not saying you're definitely like that, I'm just saying I've felt that in the past and it contributed nothing so solving the issue in the moment with a collie, or any dog",
