            "body": "It's a good idea and easy to train. When they start to chew something they shouldn't just redirect to the toy, lead them to where you want them to play, and if you have their attention have them do some work for the toy - sit, speak, whatever they know and enjoy doing. A wait command is a great way to build some impulse control.\n\nThis last part is important because you want to train a behavior between the problematic chewing and the more desirable/fun toy chewing.\n\nSince you probably don't want your dog to have access to unsupervised chewing, the behavior you want to avoid is them chewing on chair legs and power cords thinking it will get them access to the good stuff (toys and attention). If you divert and then give them work before rewarding them then you should be able to train them to come find you and start doing tricks when they want attention and access to toys which is a lot more fun for everyone.\n\nHaving my dog punch my arm to get my attention before spinning in circles and play bowing is how she tells me I've been working for too long and it's time to play.",

            "body": "Its easier to train dogs TO do things rather than NOT to do things. Dogs tend to be trained that they \\*can\\* chew certain things (their toys), and then you control when and where they get those toys, if you want to.\n\nBe careful not to reinforce the negative behaviour. If he starts chewing something that he shouldn't, do you go over and give him a toy? If so he learns: \"I should keep chewing this sofa, because whenever I do, I get a chew toy!\"\n\nInstead, watch him carefully and move him away from chewing things he shouldn't. You might try anti chew sprays on any favourite parts of the house.\n\nBy contrast, offer chew toys regularly (but not after unwanted behaviour) and offer lots of praise for chewing on those toys.\n\nSo, for example, puppy comes back from a playdate/being outside: put him in his crate and give him a chew toy, sit near him. Lots of praise for chewing on the toy!\n\nThen, its time for play time outside the crate. Tempt him out and do some obedience work. Without him noticing, take the chew toy away (you want him to learn that he gets they toy when you give it to him). Ideally you just prevent the negative behaviour (chewing sofa) pre emptively. If he starts chewing on the sofa, play time is over, and he goes back in the crate (without a toy) for a short time out. \n\nThen he learns - I better not chew on the sofa! If I do, play time is over and I get nothing to chew!\n\nBut don't give a reward for unwanted behaviour!!",

That information might be illuminating. \n\nYou can also teach an alternate to biting (I assume that people might occasionally be the victim) I teach a lick or a touch cue, rewarded of course.   Then whenever puppy gets nippy, yelp, or sharply say no.  Then request the alternate queue, either touch or lick and reward.  \nThis helped a lot when we adopted a older puppy who came into my house like the Tasmanian devil. No manners, and bad mouth manners.  We taught him a lick you by putting some peanut butter on the palm of the hand.",

One of the worst puppy nippers I ever spent any time with was a standard poodle.   Go figure.  \n\n  10 weeks is still a new baby.   Just manage with crate and safe chews.  Teach an alternate if puppy in nipping on people.  And make sure that anytime the puppy is chewing on people that you freeze, and play immediately stops. And make sure you're not doing something to wind the puppy up which encourages the nipping.   There's a lot of rough play that is appropriate for puppies between their litter mates, but just not okay with people. At 10 weeks old you're a little one has not learned the difference yet. Lots of patience. And reward good choices when you see them.  If you signed up for a puppy class, that's awesome. If you're waiting until he's a little older, find resources now to assist. There's even stuff on YouTube.",
