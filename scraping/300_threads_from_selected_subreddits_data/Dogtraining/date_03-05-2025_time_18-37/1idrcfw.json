In addition, you can make sure your dogs are getting their digging and other needs met in other ways. Be sure you're allowing them to sniff a LOT on walks. Don't worry about how far or fast you're going, just give them plenty of time and space to sniff. This is really important for all dogs, but especially scent hounds like beagles. As for digging, you could take them to a dog friendly beach and encourage them to dig in the sand there!",
