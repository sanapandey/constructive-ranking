    "selftext": "My dog is a bit nervous in general. For the last year or so she\u2019s had an annoying habit that has recently become dangerous. She doesn\u2019t want to be left behind so when we\u2019re walking through the house she darts through doorways, etc to try and stay with us. But she\u2019s usually doing it from behind. She\u2019s tripped us a few times. In the last week, every single time I\u2019ve walked up the stairs with her she has tried to shoot the gap under my foot on the last step. Eventually I\u2019m going to fall down the stairs because of this. How can I get her to chill going up the stairs? Do I make her wait at the bottom into I\u2019m at the top and call her through? \n\n\nI\u2019ve never put her in a room and hurried to shut the door behind me. Sometimes when I\u2019m working and she\u2019s downstairs with me, she\u2019ll just hang out on her bed when I go up to grab a drink. No anxiety then. It\u2019s really bizarre. ",

                    "body": "The reason for my question is because my dog is behind me, I need to keep her behind me on stairs, which is just physically tricky. I have tried resetting when she\u2019s jumped through the gap and doing it again with her behind me and reinforced that, but I can only keep her behind me by blocking the way. She still tries to jump through. \n\nShe used to jump through the door to go outside, and we\u2019ve calmed that a lot by having her sit before we open the door and stay until we tell her to go, but on the stairs that\u2019s not doable. \n\nI guess my question is less about the broad \u201ccalming your dog\u201d techniques in the guide, and more about the practicality of doing those things with the dog behind me on the stairs.",

            "body": "It would help to know a little more about your dog. What size and breed is she? Does she have a solid understanding of cues like \"wait\" or \"stay\"? Have you noticed if this behavior happens more in certain situations, like when she\u2019s particularly excited or worried about being left behind? Understanding her motivation will help shape the best approach.\n\nOne of the most effective ways to teach stair manners is to train a structured routine. You can apply a similar concept here since she\u2019s already made progress with sitting and waiting at the door. You might start by teaching her to sit at the bottom of the stairs and wait for a release cue before following you up. If she struggles with waiting, you can reinforce her for staying put by tossing treats back to her while you take a few steps up. Using a leash for controlled practice sessions can also help prevent her from rushing ahead or squeezing through gaps underfoot.\n\nIf blocking her physically is the only thing keeping her behind you, she may not yet understand the expected behavior. Instead of preventing her from moving forward, focus on reinforcing calm waiting. Pattern games, like counting \"1-2-3\" and rewarding her for staying in position, can help give her a predictable structure to follow. Some dogs also benefit from having a designated \"pause spot\" at the bottom or top of the stairs, like a mat or a step, where they learn to settle before release.\n\nIn the meantime, consider managing access to the stairs with a baby gate if safety is a concern.",

About 60 lbs. \n\nShe understands \u201cstay\u201d and \u201cenough\u201d to an extent, especially if she can see me, and she will stay at the bottom of the stairs until I call her up, but I\u2019d like her to be able to just come up with me like she used to. \n\nSituationally, I don\u2019t know what changed. Suddenly she started jumping ahead at the last step every time. It feels similar to when we\u2019re packing or doing really busy work around the house and she wants to be in the room with us, but doesn\u2019t know where we\u2019re going, so she\u2019ll dart through doorways as we\u2019re walking from room to room. She\u2019s tripped us a few times, it\u2019s just dangerous now cause it\u2019s on the stairs. But I don\u2019t want to have to do a sit stay release sequence every time we walk through an entryway in the house. We wouldn\u2019t get anything done.",
