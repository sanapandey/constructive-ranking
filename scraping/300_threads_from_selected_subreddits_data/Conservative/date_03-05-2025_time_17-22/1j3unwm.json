Didn\u2019t clap for getting that innocent teacher out of a Russian Gulag. Didn\u2019t Clap for the Firefighter who passed away saving his wife and daughters lives. Didn\u2019t clap for that 18 year who got accepted into West Point. They are absolutely deranged and honestly, seem like not just and enemy of the people but and enemy of the country with acts like that. \n\nEdit: Didn't clap for a NYC policeman with a wife and a newborn being murdered by a 22x repeat violent offender. \n\nEdit 2: Got my Reddit Cares badge of honor from this post \ud83e\udd23\n\nEdit 3: this post has 150k views and 700 ish likes...  the bot armies our in full force.
