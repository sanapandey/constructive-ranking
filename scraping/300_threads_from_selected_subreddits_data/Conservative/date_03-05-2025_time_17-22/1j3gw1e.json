Free trade allows for nations to specialize, which will increase the total capacity of goods created/manufactured (the production possibility frontier shifts outward). A trade deficit, by basic laws of supply and demand, would suggest that foreign nations are capable of producing a good cheaper than we can produce it domestically. While that may be less ideal for an American worker, it is ideal for an American consumer.\n\nWhile trade deficits can devalue a country\u2019s base currency, this is largely inapplicable to the US as we have the world\u2019s reserve currency. Since we began our trade deficit in 1976, we have not witnessed a substantial weakening of the dollar.\n\nSo, again, I\u2019ll ask you: why do you care about a trade deficit?",

To a lesser degree, I care about trade deficits out of a sense of fairness and not having Americans be taken advantage of.

But if we can't have free trade, I am also for equal trade with Canada and other Western countries which Trump is gonna help us out with.  \n\nYes, I understand that our trade relationship is complicated, especially with oil and gas.

I do not understand when you say you are concerned with trade deficits \u201cout of fairness and not having other Americans being taken advantage of.\u201d How are Americans being taken advantage of? No one is compelling anyone to buy cheap foreign goods.\n\nTrade deficits don\u2019t really have much to do with the budgets of other governments. I agree NATO countries need to boost defense spending and stop relying entirely on our military umbrella.

I should not have to explain that on r/conservative.  What is annoying is having people get flair and then spout leftist talking points, there's entire threads from the mods about this.  If that isn't you and you're a real conservative, then I am sorry for you.  \n\n>How are Americans being taken advantage of?\u00a0\n\nAgain, this is axiomatic.  Americans are hurt when other countries tariff American products.  It's bad for American companies when they can't sell their goods on a global market.  Do I really have to say more?  \n\nIn the case of the Chinese, it hurts 2x as bad because they steal our IP at the same time.    \n\n>Trade deficits don\u2019t really have much to do with the budgets of other governments.\n\nNonsensical.  If this were true, then Canada wouldn't care about the tariffs or incoming trade war.",

If I am wrong, I would agree with you, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.\n\nChinese corporate espionage is a bad thing, on that I agree with you, however, this is not related to our trade deficit with them. When I buy a cheap plastic toy, I am not degrading any American company\u2019s IP. They are hacking these companies illegally and would do so even if we didn\u2019t trade with them at all.\n\nCanada cares about tariffs because it will hurt their businesses. It is time honored tradition to reciprocate tariffs to save face. Besides Trump attaching a demand for Canada to increase defense spending (which afaik he has not done, he has only spoken about fentanyl crossing the border) tariffs are not related to Canada\u2019s budget/spending.",

All used to \u201cprotect Canadian businesses\u201d.\n\nThese pre-existing tariffs remain in effect and are separate from the retaliatory measures:\n\n- Dairy Products:\n  - Milk: Up to 270%\n  - Cheese: Up to 245%\n  - Butter: Up to 298%\n- Poultry:\n  - Chicken: Up to 238%\n  - Eggs: Up to 163%\n- Grains:\n  - Barley: Up to 160%\n  - Wheat: Up to 94%\n- Notes: These high tariffs are part of Canada\u2019s supply management system to protect domestic producers and are applied under tariff-rate quotas (TRQs). Imports within the quota face lower or no tariffs, while over-quota imports incur these steep rates. These rates predate the 2025 trade dispute but have been cited in discussions about U.S.-Canada trade imbalances.",
