What they did say however is that 85% of Us border apprehensions dropped from jan 21-jan 31st, but to anyone that knows statistics its bcz of the halt of legal immigration as well. Also that number isnt correct the total encounter number is 81,792 still better than biden tho",

They obviously wouldn't state it's to destabilize the country and import a voter base and the first step in turning out an opposing argument is understanding it fundamentally.\n\nJabba the Hutt Michael Moore seemed to think one of the immigrants might be able to cure cancer or divert an asteroid heading to earth.  So there's that argument, but it's too stupid to be taken seriously for deconstruction.  Now the liberals are saying we need to fix immigration because the deportations aren't ok.  Alright, then why didn't they do it for 4 years instead of allowing this to happen?  And at what point does allowing this look malfeasant and treasonous in lieu of effectively governing immigration?\n\nAt the very least they are objectively incompetent.  At worst they are in on a conspiracy of malice against the American public.  Which is it?",

You see, watching the ballooning costs at some point their media must have started telling them the affordable care act was never supposed to make care more affordable.  Same exact fucking thing happened with the inflation reduction act.  \"Well, it was never meant to reduce inflation\".\n\nHuh?  Then why the fuck was it titled that?  \n\nPerhaps they know people will read the title, assume that's what it is, then never read the actual bill.  This way they can turn around and change the narrative.  Keep it vague and give the title at the time, then gaslight later on.",
