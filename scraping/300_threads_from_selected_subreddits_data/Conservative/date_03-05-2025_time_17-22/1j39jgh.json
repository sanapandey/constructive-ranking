Canada has a massive drug smuggling and illegal immigration problem. While this isn't directly harming the US, we do a lot of trade with Canada. Canada's economy is suffering severely from these issues, and their government is doing nothing about it. It's hard for the US to trade with a country who's struggling financially. Trump wants Canada to be strong, safe, and secure. There is value in Canada, yet their government is destroying their nation. Trump is demanding Canada solve all of these issues on their own, so that the US can be stronger and safer, along with having a better economy.",

These leftoids are something else, and it\u2019s pathetic.\n\nI'll flat out tell you: I downvoted you because your explanation of what constitutes \"an act of war\" is so far from being factually accurate, it's laughable.\n\nCanada absolutely - unequivocably - has the right to refuse to sell power to the US. No - it is not an act of war; it is an act of economic suicide. And it is *likely* a violation of bilateral trade agreements (e.g., NAFTA, '92 Canada-US Energy, etc.). \n\nBut it is Not an act of war.",
