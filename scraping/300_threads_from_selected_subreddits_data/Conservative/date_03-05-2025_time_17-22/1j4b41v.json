Saving lives, stopping criminals, saving the American people billions from stopping waste and fraud, honoring victims and survivors. \n\nIf you're protesting something because of who got it done or who informs you about it, then you don't actually care about the things that matter. You only care about getting credit for yourself over them. Not the good things being done, only that you don't get credit for it. \n\nThat's not only rotten and nasty, that's as un-American as you can be.",
