Dylan Roof and the Boston Marathon bomber are currently on federal death row.\n\nBut Congress would have to make killing a law enforcement officer a federal crime and make it eligible for the death penalty. It's unlikely to happen. For one, there are so many types of different law enforcement officers, many of whom aren't federal agents. Local police, county sheriffs, state police, etc.",

Even if he can\u2019t get it passed federally, some red state governors will look to enact legislation of that nature.  California and Oregon would scream bloody m*rder about it though.",
