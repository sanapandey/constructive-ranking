The victory condition for Ukraine is kicking out Russians from all seized territories, including Crimea. Without thousands of boots on the ground, this is not going to happen. Ukraine does not have enough bodies to conquer and garrison those areas. Further, we should remember every frontline troop needs multiple soldiers behind the lines to resupply and guard the rear. So the manpower imbalance is even worse than the metrics indicate.\n\nA military rescue of Ukraine now would require a Normandy landing sized force of troops and logistics support. Naturally, any western state that does this would be committing an act of war against Russia and certainly trigger nuclear escalation.  I realize the left doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge the truth, but it can be hidden about as well as the sun.",
