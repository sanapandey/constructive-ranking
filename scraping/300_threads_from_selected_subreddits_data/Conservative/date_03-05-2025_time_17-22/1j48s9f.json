Searching on the term I found a lot of academic journal articles with terms like \"Migrants' Multifocal Sedentarism\" which explores \"Ambivalent Belonging and Desired Recognition in Transnational Social Fields\" and finds that \"ambivalence comes to the fore in the dissonance that emerges when juxtaposing the sedentarism of migrant lives, with their spatially multiple belonging\".\n\nSo, yeah! Very technical important stuff. We wouldn't be able to understand all the nuance without a PhD in socioanalytical ethnography. I am told my wanting to defund this research only shows how uneducated and anti-science I am.",

We don't want illegal sedentary, nomadic, or transhumant migrants. You don't need to be heavily indoctrinated by communist academics to understand the intricacies of such topics in the information age. You can study materials on your own, discuss them in online forums, and now use AI for in-depth discussions. You still need to use critical thinking skills in all those cases, but the resources are definitely at the average person's disposal these days.\n\nReddit and US universities tend to be filled with pseudo-intellectuals whose only talent is to regurgitate crap takes and do what they are told without questioning it. That's a big part of the reason this country is falling behind the rest of the civilized world.",

The national debt is the accumulated deficits. \n\nWhile Bill was president we had a budget surplus due to many factors. A big one was that Rs were in charge in the house. It is the house and only the house that writes the budget. Gingrich promised a balanced budget and the two sides made compromises to get that done and it worked out.  Bill did not and would not have done that on his own. \n\nAlso while he was president he got rid of about 377k federal jobs. The issue is why was it okay then and not now??\n\nAlso, spending went through the roof cause we were brutally attacked on 9/11. The problem is we never went back to spending less after we got done with that response. \n\nAs is right now, if we went back to 2019 spending we'd have a balanced budget today.
