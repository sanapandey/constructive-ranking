They'd rather our country do poorly, and people suffer so they can regain control than do well under Trump.\n\nNo matter how much I disagreed with previous president's, I always hoped for the best and that they'd prove me wrong. I never wished our country to suffer based on political polarization.\n\nEdit: word",
