            "body": "This still to me misses the biggest issue at hand for these kind of mass actions: what cause are we protesting for, what are the demands of the people protesting, and what escalation, be that further protests or additional civil disobedience, will be taken if the demands are not met. I\u2019ve yet to hear a coherent answer for the first question, let alone the second or third. If the point is just to get out and have everyone stamp their feet about how they don\u2019t like the current administration then I feel like this will fall flat on its head, especially since a protest at a state capital is not likely to effect anyone but state legislators and governors.\n\nEdit: I did see a version of these posters this morning that implied with a progress pride flag that these were in opposition to the administrations treatment of trans folks. Far be it from me as one of these reviled transes to deny the support but it does feel a little bit suspicious that this is the first I\u2019ve seen implying a concrete goal or motivation and even then it\u2019s only an implication of one. Maybe I\u2019m just being too conspiratorial, I really hope I am.",

While I appreciate the drive to cause a rallying of the people, it does no good to storm out to the state capitols and yell \"we're angry.\" What, specifically, are you angry about, what do you want them to do, and are your people willing to continue protesting past the original date if necessary? It seems like it started with his anti-trans EO, became about immigration, and now its just become a mass conglomeration of people saying fuck Trump. I agree with the sentiment, but that's not going to make changes. It doesnt help that many of these dont seem well organized or backed by anyone locally willing to support the protestors. I could be vastly misunderstanding, but thats how it seems from where I'm sitting.",

As they pointed out in that thread one of the goals of project 2025 was to use any mass civil unrest as an excuse to declare martial law, and considering how barring a few exceptions the current administration has followed those guidelines almost to a tee, it seems reasonable to at least be wary of a protest movement with no organization beyond some posters and hashtags and no concrete goals to campaign for.",

As in, the more the government escalates, the more galvanized people on the sidelines are likely to be and the more difficult it becomes for people unconcerned with politics to ignore what's happening (*\u00e0 la* the civil disobedience of the 60s, the civil rights marches and freedom riders and so on).\n\n\nOf course, I share your concerns though.",

I mean just look at the efforts of the people in Montgomery during the Bus Boycotts, it took several months of work and sacrifices from all members of the community to get stuff done. The current protests and occupy both seemingly lack any kind of unifying goal to keep things going beyond a day or two of stamping our feet",

I get that the energy to do *something* is really high right now and that they want to do something **now**. \n\nThis does mean they're making a ton of mistakes. Mistakes that might be dangerous to people going to the protest. Mistakes that even slightly more experienced people would be able to address. Unfortunately they're not doing the greatest job at either reaching out to experienced folks or giving them a platform to share their knowledge.\n\nI don't live in the US so I'm not sure how much my advice counts for here. If this was happening near me I'd do what I can to convey some tips to protest safely. What gear to bring and what to leave at home, you rights, how to act in case of arrest, basic protest etiquette, &c. I'd also be pushing to organisers to create space for a 'revolutionary bloc' in their demonstration. \n\nEither way I'd (personally) check it out. Not in black bloc unless numbers are guaranteed. These people **need** advice from people who know what they're doing. Most of them I have severe ideological problems with. They're being ignorant about opsec, history, tactics, strategy, police tactics, &c. I'd go to these protests for the same reason I'd stay with a friend who took some psychadelics or had too much to drink or with kids swordfighting with sticks: it'd be irresponsible to let it go unsupervised. I recognize this is very cynical but there's not much (from the limited info I've seen) to warrant more than cynicism",

They normally spend their efforts forcing their newsletters and pamphlets down people's throats, while making trans girls and women of color do all the actual hard work for them. They probably see this as a good opportunity to recruit. But they're all such odious people that I can't imagine wide-eyed liberals listening to their pro-DPRK sermons lmao",
