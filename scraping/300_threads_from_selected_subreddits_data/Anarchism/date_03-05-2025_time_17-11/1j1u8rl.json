I'd say not, though if you could clarify a bit more about the meaning of \"approximate general political current\" I'd be grateful. \n\nHere, it's essentially a mish-mash of all.\nStudents hold fast in not wanting to get their hands dirty with party politics, although I must say the word \"politics\" or \"politicized\" has a VERY bad reputation here.\n\nDue to that, whenever the government makes another feeble attempt at discrediting us, they go for any variant of \"student blockades are politicized\"! So we've come to highly differentiate \"party politics\" which is what we all despise and \"politics as a way of life\" - and we adopt the latter.\n\nPolitics as a way of life, essentially, is to say that student protests ARE political, inherently, but in the same exact way as saying that being actively interested in the well-being of your wider community and not wanting to take perceived injustices lying down anymore is politics. So in that sense you don't need to be a politician or in a political party for that.",

Not that such things are completely absent, if for example, you are to interpret the \"politics as a way of life\" part of my comment as having something of a more leftist kick to it, but in general, if you were to think or hope that what's happening in Serbia right now is going to at some point facilitate some kind of grand leftist revolution or big societal shifts, you are, by all appearances, in for a *massive* dissapointment.\n\nAs I said in another reply, our protests are, by their nature, mostly reactionary and the messages of the protesters could be more-or-less boiled down to \"we just want existing institutions to do their job\" and \"we advocate for respecting the law!\", none of which are remotely leftist. \n\nThey are a big, long overdue, reaction against the shockingly corrupt, non-transparent, partocratic (SNS-dominated) and authoritarian government that's been riding and fucking us around for 13 years and with time has been losing any semblance of restraint, increasingly sure of their power and our unfortunate ability to put up with them and do nothing.\n\nBut again, from a more leftist perspective, our protests admittedly are mostly still more or less pro-status quo in the sense that they're mostly about restarting the system, just with a lot less corruption and monopoly of one party over the government or in other words, cleaning it from the accumulated dirt but not changing it in a more fundamental way.",

But from my knowledge of that, it was in a context of the students already having a very solid base of such organizing over years (decades) that enabled the functioning to ramp up and work well in a mass way.\n\nSo I am wondering how this came to be in Serbia, what are the foundations that existed before this current uprising and how it contributed, and what is being spontaneously learned and practiced. Also the question is if this type of self-organizing is being envisioned to be implemented in some ways 'after' the current moment, however it changes; for instance I think if the demands are met (I don't know if this is at all a realistic possibility), then would this movement back down, or what would happen: what are people thinking and talking about, if there is space to imagine what this leads to in a longer term?\n\nSolidarity!",

Do note however, in this entire story, there is hardly an \"a\" of anarchism here. \n\nThe best we are trying is attempting a more or less classic direct-democracy approach in our plenums or plenary sessions where we hope there are as many students as possible present. Everyone can vote, everyone can have a word, one at a time and so on. Decisions are arrived at with simple majorities, albeit votes are most often unanimous or almost unanimous, in my experience. \n\n>Also the question is if this type of self-organizing is being envisioned to be implemented in some ways 'after' the current moment, however it changes; for instance I think if the demands are met (I don't know if this is at all a realistic possibility), then would this movement back down, or what would happen: what are people thinking and talking about, if there is space to imagine what this leads to in a longer term?\n\nNow here's the onion (HBO Rome reference, sorry I had to :))! \n\nWell, this is what I meant when I said there is very little leftist in general, let alone anarchist thought or influence unfortunately. \n\nWhile there are certainly people from all sorts of political spectrums, ideologies and so on, unfortunately, these protests (from a leftist perspective), are kind of... simply reactionary. A reaction against an increasingly authoritarian, 13 years in power government that's high on partocracy and displays absolutely shocking levels of corruption and lack of restraint in that corruption. \n\nComing back to the protests and their reactionary nature, they can be, for the most part, boiled down to \"we want the laws and constitution to be respected\" and \"we just want institutions to do their job\". Hardly anyone is talking about things like evils of capitalism, class struggle/consciousness, abolishing traditional power structures, flaws of laws or discussing hierarchies/anarchist philosophy. \n\nThere isn't much, if at all, of \"let's overthrow the system of government entirely, abolish the police and other state apparatus and self-organize into a fundamentally more egalitarian (anarchist) society\". \n\nSometimes, rarely, you might hear ideas being thrown around reforming things into a more direct>representative democracy, but other than that, it's mostly about replacing a corrupt government with \"less corrupt government\" or replacing \"bad\" officials with \"better\" ones. \n\nTo be more concrete, there's most often been talk about forming a \"government of experts\" to act as a transitional government and to facilitate lustration of countless corrupt SNS and other officials. But after that, it's mostly about providing a more fair or even playing field for resumption of ordinary elections. So it's not really about changing or even reforming the system much as it is about restarting things. \n\nAs for the student demands... Yeah, the chances of this government willingly giving in to any one of them would mean them having to go to prison or massively de-powering them, and we are aware of that, so the deadlock is on. How or when will it end? No one knows but it's likely gonna be ugly, in one way or another.\n\n> Solidarity!\n\nThank you very much!",
