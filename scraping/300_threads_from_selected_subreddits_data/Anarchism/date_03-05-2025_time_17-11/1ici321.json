I thought Elon Musk doing the Nazi salute would cause a worldwide scandal, but now I think I was wrong. \n\nThe U.S.A. has been falling with disturbing rapidity. In just a few days in office, the orange man has already left the country in a deplorable state. \n\n* Nationwide ban on transgender healthcare for people under 19.\n* Stop cancer research.\n* Halt Medicaid for millions across all 50 states.\n* Firing women leaders in the military.\n* ICE raids (they can arrest children from schools now)\n* Food prices continue to rise.\n* Medications and prescription drugs increased by 4200%.\n* Gulf of Mexico is now Gulf of America.\n* Firing DOJ officials who worked on criminal investigations of the president.\n* There is a fucking neo nazi within the government.\n\nAnd more shit I don't remember right now. U.S.A. is already fucked up, and, if no one does something quickly, we'll be asking ourselves in 50 years how did we get at such point of no return. Elon Musk actively supports a neo nazi political party in Germany. So, it isn't just about U.S.A. It's about the rest of the world too. \n\nWe went through fascism before and we will not fucking do it again! Eat the rich, eat the nazi! ",

A lot of communities have those efforts already happening. Do you want to work on ensuring trans folks have access to healthcare? You can get in touch with the local queer community and help in ways they need or checkout Four Thieves Vinegar Collective. Maybe you just want to work with FoodNotBombs to help feed the hungry. We can't all fight every single head of this fascist hydra, so pick one and get to whacking. If you have the energy beyond that you can go to protests when they happen near you",

Fascism is a far right, authoritarian political ideology characterized by extreme nationalism, supression of dissent, centralized power, and often militarism. Historically, it's associated with regimes like Mussolini's Italy or Nazi Germany. I know that in internet debates, \"fascist\" is often used to describe anyone with strict or conservative views, which waters down its true historical and political meaning.\n\nUnlike other right-wing ideologies and doctrines, fascism is inherently negative and harmful to millions of people around the world. Fascism thrives on fear, division and apathy. The rise of fascism in the 20th century was enabled by complacency, economic turmoil, and widespread propaganda. To prevent history from repeating itself, we must remain vigilant, proactive, and united.\n\nWhen I say that there is a new fascist wave in the world, I mean that the richest (and therefore most powerful) man in the world actively supports a far-right political party in Germany, which discreetly includes Nazi symbology in its propaganda. Search \u201cAfD Germany\u201d for more information. \n\nFurthermore, as if things couldn't get any worse, the richest man in the world, who is a Nazi, is also in the U.S. government. And the president seems to have no problem with it. Even after that Nazi salute in Germany. Literally any president would have urgently invited Elon Musk for a chat that would start like this, \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d, but nothing of the sort happened. The president's silence tells me all I need to know.\n\nTo this day I can't believe that millions of Americans voted for Donald Trump for president. I'm amazed that his history of sexual abuse and racism didn't stop them from voting for him. I thought the voters in my home country were the worst, but fuck, this beats them by a ton.",

Dictators are in charge of Belarus (really sad, love this country, hate Lukashenko) and Russia, and many, many more.\n\nAll fascists were bad (Franco, Salazar, Pinochet, Batista, etc.) and will always be bad. There is no tolerance for fascists. However, there is for normal right-winged. Some people just don't like others who have different opinions. However, if a doctrine is harmful, there is no way I'll tolerate it. In fact, I'll be against it. The same is true with authoritarian leftists like, for example, maoists.\n\nAs you say, we should fight the fascists and I can call Trump and muSSk fascists confidently.

Figure out who's going to handle child-care while you're running all-hands events and other logistical challenges like that. Get people sharing skills to get your project done. No part of the operation should be exclusive to one person. Everyone trains their backup.

But after watching how all struggles became part of a reformist and socialdemocratic party (in my country) because the anarchists were all disorganised, because we didn't have a plan to counter them, or a strategy to radicalize the mass movements or try to plan to counter their tranformation in \"demanding the state X or Y\" instead of using direct action (not only making them more horizontal and preventing autoritarian socialists and , that only is half the work needed).\n\n\nJoining an anarchist specifist group you can develop analysis to help promote new grassroots movements in your town or workplace, find which demands will unit all the people and make them participate in our common struggles, unite the differente fronts (work, housing, antiracism, ecology) with strategies with \"reformist\" struggles such as better working hours or lower rents. Then we can help little by little getting bigger and more radical demands.\nSuch thing can only be done when us anarchists unite in political groups in a collective and federal way help us and also participating in the mass movements and class struggles, both of them are needed.\nWhen can't be outside of the working class struggles (we are in fact part of the working class) and we can't be divided as anarchists and not join us in political groups (historically we had better victories and became stronger using this strategy)\n\n\nThis platformist and specifist strategy could be traced back to the Aliance of Bakunin, a lot of texts from Malatesta, the Dielo Truda group of Makhno and Arshinov, the FAKB from Bulgaria in the 40s, the amigos de Durruti in the Spanish Revolution, the FAU group in the 60-70s in Uruguay and today you will find plenty of oragnizations that are starting to implement this organised form of anarchism worldwide like the UCL in France, the OSL in Brasil or Black Rose in the USA.",
