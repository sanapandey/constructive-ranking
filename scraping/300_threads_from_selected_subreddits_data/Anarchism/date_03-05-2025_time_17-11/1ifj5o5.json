Well needless to say I was very proud of him, but I don't think I'm the most qualified person to answer that. I told him they evolved from hierarchies that formed naturally as humanity began to adopt agriculture. But beyond that he should probably look at actual anarchist teachings because, though I fuck with anarchist heavily, I wouldn't consider myself one. I would like to encourage him in that direction. Would appreciate some advice and maybe some references I can give him. ",

Against The Grain: A Deep History Of the Earliest States by James.C.Scott\n\n2.Seeing like a State by James.C.Scott.\n\n3.The State And It's Historic Role by Peter Kropotkin.\n\nThe books are pretty dense, I highly recommend checking out different Anarchist philophers, and their books to gain different perspectives. And read them together wuth your brither so he can get a better understanding about the State.\n\nAnother source I would recommend is Anark and his playlist on Anarchist books, the Anarchist Library and Ninalingworths Library of Anarchist book recommendation. \n\nHopefully this helps.",

If the brother is, as I'm guessing from the question, at all the nerdy/ history geek type (and as one myself I do think that's a positive thing!!), he'll probably really enjoy the way the book tells the story of (pre) history.",

Salinger in a few years), Ursula K LeGuin - I read Ray Bradbury and George Orwell a bit early maybe, but Animal Farm should be a good read - these questions are huge, but get them to realise that understanding is a journey, it's not like maths where you just give an answer and accept it, you have to connect various elements, so increase reading comprehension as much as possible so in a couple of years they can engage with Dostoevsky, Gogol and Tolstoy, Camus, Foucault, Sartre, Goldman, Gabriel Garcia Marquez etc.\n\nThe short answer is \"Organised religion and the state exist, because the path to hell is paved with good intentions\"",

The point is that those in charge get something *from* us\n\n\nThe Church gets tithes, and also the chance to make us do what they want and feel power over us, for example. The government helps the owning class to stay in control and continue to extract profit from working class people via the wages system. Patriarchy continues in order that the male head of the household can use his wife(s) as a free baby factory, use women and often children for free labour, and extract psychological capital from the women and children under his power\n\n\nIn short all of these involve power which in turn leads to exploitation and the drive to get more power in order to take more from us. For how the modern institution specifically evolved I'd recommend Rudolf Rocker's Nationalism and Culture and Sylvia Federici's Caliban and the Witch. Both may be a bit old for him, but there are audio versions if that helps!",

Sometimes we humans can imagine we are safer when we're frightened and trying to control life. Of course, this is absurd, but our subconscious programming can be like that. These patterns of trauma can then become institutionalised and normalised. \n\nGraeber & Wengrow's The Dawn of Everything seems to point out that stateless agriculture is entirely possible and historically enacted. This is encouraging for potentially anarchic permaculture futures!\n\nYou might also recommend he read The Wizard of Earthsea. Ursula Le Guin's anarchism isn't limited to The Dispossessed. He's the right age for it if he hasn't read it already. Her work, it seems to me, helps to uninstall subconscious programming of the statist, patriarchal, etc kind and make space for liberation.",

I think general answers like you have are probably fine, and then let him keep asking his own questions. \n\nYou can read some historical non-fiction together and help him contextualize it if he\u2019s interested enough to commit to a project like that.",

            "body": "It is worth, in my opinion, equipping him with the idea that there is a distinction between faith/spiritualism and religion. Having metaphysical beliefs, using spiritualism to explain certain aspects of the human existence, is something that it is impossible to give a more concrete answer to than \"it seems to be a function of how many people's brains work when faced with things that are otherwise unexplained\". Religion, by contrast, is systems built up around those beliefs. Religion generally standardises what explanations people use, and serves to influence what people do, either directly (orthopraxic religions) or by influencing what they believe (orthodoxic religions). Probably leave that last distinction out for a 12 year old but I'm trying to be complete in my explanation.\n\nAs to the why, well, the specifics will vary enormously but the general theme is because getting that control is beneficial to a group of people and so they want it, even if they don't realise they're doing that. People often react to things benefiting them without realising it, because they don't question that things are right if they're working out for them.\n\nGovernments are probably a bit different. The earliest forms of strongly hierarchical social organisations I'm aware of in Europe tend towards those with force using it to make others accept their rule, which is much more specific and deliberate than I think the development of most religions were. Ironically, most of our modern governments are systems set up as compromises between the majority population and the previous ruling classes (variously nobility/royalty or the generationally wealthy) and everyone else, because the options were to concede some power or be destroyed. By conceding some power, they could split groups like the newly rich and the middle classes off from the interests of the remainder and prevent greater change. That invariably means we have governments that still prioritise the needs of a small minority, but in less blatant and inflexible ways. As with religion, if things are going well for you you're unlikely to question whether it's good, and so these concessions encouraged a small but powerful slice to accept the new setup uncritically. I am massively oversimplifying because of the context, but hopefully this point is clear - government through kings arose as a result of a small number of people acting selfishly, and what we have now largely resulted from allowing a slightly bigger group of the population to be selfish.\n\nYoh should definitely be clear that you went away to research an answer. Whether you provide a good or satisfactory explanation is probably less important in the long run than teaching it's OK not to know an answer, to admit that, and to both ask for help and know where to learn more. Also that it's OK to change your mind when presented with new information.",
