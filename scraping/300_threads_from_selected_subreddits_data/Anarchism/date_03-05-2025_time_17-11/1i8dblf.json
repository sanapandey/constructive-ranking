Their goal is to (a) remove all DEI programs, jobs, & evidence of DEI, (b) eliminate as much of the workforce as possible which only can be done in crazy ways as we\u2019re union and can\u2019t be fired, and (c) appear to their followers to be improving productivity with less funding.\n\nHigh ranking positions are politically appointed & can turnover with new administration. Those with DEI job titles (Director, Coordinator, trainer, etc) are terminated (or administrative leave pending it) as the EO eliminated the programs completely. Many weren\u2019t  full-time jobs so half of your title or a collateral assignment.\n\nThey want us to snitch if we know someone suddenly has a new job title, rewording of job duties, or any rebellious DEI activities ongoing. So when Black History Month starts, if someone mentions it you report it. Or if you see a Pride flag lanyard for a name-tag (which I received last Pride Month with VA swag all over it), report.  They\u2019ve already accessed our emails and deleted the pronoun tags - which we were all told to put them in by the last administration. \n\nNew EO\u2019s and orders come almost hourly. They have not gone after DEI related hires (yet) but have clarified that people with disabilities are still protected. They are making \u2018lists\u2019 of probationary, telework, and remote employees with justification why they are \u2018essential.\u2019",
