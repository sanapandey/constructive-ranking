It's incorrect to label anarchism *as a whole* an \"anti-polity movement\" as most theories of anarchism ***are compatible*** with polity-forms.\n\nHe then provided many counter arguments to the \"anti-polity\" position.",

I don't see how either of these are polity-forms, unless they are formed by representatives and violate free association principles, in which case they're definitionally not anarchist. Really this idea that anarchism isn't anti-polity seems odd, considering that polity is just another word for the Greek arche. He talks about some cases for when polity-forms might be useful, but just because he is purportedly an anarchist, doesn't mean those are anarchist positions. I can find anarchists who prefer democratic consensus over free association in some cases. Those opinions are still violating foundational  anarchist principles. The video does not make any attempt to explain why, what appear to be clear definitional differences, are in fact anarchist in nature, other than that him and some other anarchists might find them viable.",

Anark is on the side that we would generally use more organized channels of communication and consensus - especially at scale - so that we could ensure good organization within in the system. While the other side argues that every relationship must be temporary, and that stronger organization is hierarchy.",

Furthermore, when anark and many of these modern anarchists say \"direct democracy\", they simply mean a consensus body.\n\nWhen anark is talking about polity forms at various scales, he's arguing that generally static local groups of people will come together at generally static locations - and that communities will have relatively static methods of confederation at various levels to agree on stuff like road width, or to organize an internet, or whatever.\n\nThat these organizations at various levels may delegate people to carry out their consensus - delegating a crew to maintain the road - for instance.\n\nAll of these things occurring through relatively static communication structures.\n\nOn the other hand, systems which need to be more dynamic can take a more decentralized or ad-hoc form. This society is not designed to limit you in any way, but rather provide the most amount of freedom in the possible ways that something could be organized.",

Your definition here is\n\n>A polity is an \"external constitution of the social power\"\n\nThe important distinction here is that it's *external*, meaning that someone else but us decides how our collective power is wielded. Opposing the external constitutions of our collective power is the core principle of anarchism.\n\nThen there is also the idea of some, that EVERY form of organization requires to be in polity-form. This is a common liberal point of view, a sort of government-fetish, which anarchists naturally oppose. This point of view is strictly about the deferrence of power (and responsibility) into set roles, heads of departments, heads of state, rulers ruling over their domain subjects. The externality here is baked in, and that is probably what most anarchists argue against when they say that anarchism is anti-polity.\n\nYou can well have permanent organizations, as long as they do not cross over into ruling over us, which would separate them into their own class of persons above the rest of us (a ruling class, if you will) and consequently make them external to society as a whole. That is where they would become an \"arche\" (or polity by this definition).\n\nThe more useful conversation here is probably wether a polity definitionally has to have an *external* constitution of power, and what exactly that means. We can then conclude that some polity-forms might be compatible with anarchism, and where and when exactly they become incompatible when certain structural criteria are met. As your definition stands, I don't think it can at all be compatible with anarchist principles, since the very core principle of self-governance is violated by the consitution of power being external.\n\nI should note here that in essentially all discussions of polity-forms I've seen, the structure could essentially be distilled down to \"ruled by ...\", and the anarchist position of \"ruled by none\" wasn't one of the many possible structures, but the rejection of being ruled, the rejection of divvying up society into separate classes and (consequently?) rejection of the concept as a whole.",

The way you defined polity as an *external* constitution, they're not compatible with anarchism on a fundamental level.

Traditionally they do, but it's more important to me that we define terms and know what we're talking about than to \"well-actually\" each other with dictionary definitions. \n\nIt's not entirely outlandish to say that forms of anarchy are an alternative to other polities, like a republic, a monarchy, etc, instead of their antithesis. It's not a common view, but it's not outright wrong either. You'll just have to be clear with what you mean when you argue with people who say anarchism is anti-polity, because they do mean a specific thing and they're not incorrect within their definition. At that point you're not arguing that anarchism isn't anti-polity as such, but that your concept of polity is wider than theirs and that is why you disagree with their statement.",

But this passage doesn't address the structural concerns that would allow us to judge by the terms that you presumably reject. \n\nFrom my perspective, a polity is a hierarchical social structure. So presumably those who reject my position either believe that hierarchical social structures are fundamental to all social organization \u2014 and this is perhaps the position of those pro-democracy folks who expect to decide things, when \"necessary,\" by majoritarian means \u2014 or they think about the elevation of the collectivity over individuals in terms that are not hierarchical, but are still somehow at odds with the critique I've made. In the second case, it would be useful to have specifics, since that would help us clarify the disagreement. \n\nAnd, no, I haven't made any universal claims. I've presented what I consider to be a consistent synthesis from historical sources \u2014 setting aside some, as we will necessarily do, that seem to be more *archic* than *anarchic.*",

I can control what that structure does, and I can push to dissolve that structure, I can vote against things, and I can dissasociate from it.\n\nI think I understand your problem with this, but I fail to see how some organization existing for only a short-time prevents the same problem from arising.

He cites almost all classical, and many contemporary anarchies in his analysis. Do you even read his stuff?\n\n>This work is not meant to be a brief introduction to the topic. There are plenty of those already in existence. Instead, I want to offer a modern synthesis of anarchist ideas. So, whereas many other books and essays endeavor to give a broad, non-committal overview, here I want to ground you in a particular location within the body of anarchist thought. In doing this, we will not wander down every trail, but we will stop to look at the scenery from time to time. And, for this reason, one might see this work as motivated by the impulse described by Voline in his work On Synthesis :\n\n>\u201cThe anarchist conception must be synthetic: it must seek to become the great living synthesis of the different elements of life, established by scientific analysis and rendered fruitful by the synthesis of our ideas, our aspirations and the bits of truth that we have succeeded in discovering; it must do it if it wishes to be that precursor of truth, that true and undistorted factor, not bankrupting of human liberation and progress, which the dozens of sullen, narrow and fossilized \u2018isms\u2019 obviously cannot become.\u201d\n\n[https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anark-a-modern-anarchism](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anark-a-modern-anarchism)",

I would like you to point me towards where, in anark's [A Modern Anarchism](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anark-a-modern-anarchism) (where he lays out his ideas most completely), he conflates anarchism and communalism?\n\nBecause anark's proposal is based on free confederations of unions of egoists based on consensus, while communalism proposes majority rule, and limits the ability of groups to walk out of confederations.\n\nEdit:\n\nHe lays out his ideas in strict complex systems terms. The two I'm referencing here are such:\n\n>**Equality-Solidarity: democracy/consensus**  \nCooperation in use of equal structural power is embodied in structural consent, **called either consensus or democracy by various theorists**. That is to say, we conceive that collective actions should only move forward insofar as they are held as cooperatively approved by those actors involved and that they abide by libertarianism. This maintains strong sub-systems couplings, while also preventing over-centralization of power. It is an interplay between the pull of the clique and the push of power sharing.\n\n>**Unique-Ownness-Solidarity: free association**\n\n>We also find a very important fusion in the triune of human uniqueness, the apprehension of others, and who they choose to associate with. This is what gives us the principle of free association under anarchism. People should not be forced to associate, to organize with, to fraternize with those who they do not desire to. Said otherwise, they may disassociate from whatever collective they please. In this, the collective that they choose under free association could be called the \u2018union of egoists,\u2019 as Stirner called it. And the structures laid out here, as often specified by the social anarchist, could be seen as the mechanisms by which an enduring, wide-spanning, effective union of egoists would be formed.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI think this mis-conception comes from his practical organizing strategy. He's a strict pragmatist, and of the opinion that anarchists, libertarian socialists, indigenous communities, and many more can form a united front against hiarchial power structures - a broad spectrum of people, communities, ideas, and practices.\n\nPurity will get us killed, but working with authoritarians will also get us killed. \n\nThe zapatistas are not anarchist, but they are both our allies, and we can learn much from their movement.",

Anark is rather hostile to Mutualists. Andrew favours affinity groups and fluid organisations over formal organization. In my experience, Anark is the opposite. Anark also keeps going on tirades on individualists these days, which I don\u2019t see Andrew doing often. Andrew is also tech-critical. Anark is more of a \"let's mine the Kuiper belt\" kind of guy.\n\nEven their approach is different. Andrew picks different problems and explores anarchist solutions for it. Anark is focused more on creating \u201cthe anarchist metaphysics\u201d so to speak.\n\nAlso, I didn\u2019t say I don\u2019t understand his opinions, it\u2019s just I don\u2019t think he understands a lot of things he thinks he does. For example, in his video on Nietzsche, he says Deleuze and Guattari agree with his criticism of Nietzsche while they never did such a thing in any of their collaborations. There\u2019s also his video on Historical Materialism where he shows an appalling lack of understanding of the thing he\u2019s criticizing. I\u2019m not a Marxist so it doesn\u2019t bother me but it\u2019s pretty evident he\u2019s out of his depth while talking about a lot of things.",
