He ran a radical bookstore in Buffalo's Black community and when riots broke out among the youth, he was blamed for inciting them, and later charged with rioting and drug possession and sentenced to 40 years in prison. Though he is often forgotten today, while in prison he led many successful court cases that expanded religious and political rights for prisoners across the United States.",
