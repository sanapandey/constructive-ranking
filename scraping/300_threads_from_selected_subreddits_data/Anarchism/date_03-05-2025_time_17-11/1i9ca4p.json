One of my teachers was married to a guy from Ireland and it took him about 4 years to get citizenship, it sounded long at the time but compared to other people it was practically quick. So a guy with all the privileges of being a white, college educated, english speaker who was in a relationship with an American took 4 entire years to get citizenship. It seemed then, and seems now, absurd that it should take that long.",

Maybe an easy to get visa that costs about 50 bucks and voila you\u2019re in. Then look for any job you want and whenever you feel like turn up to a center, pay them another 50 bucks. Prove you can write a sentence in English and can answer basic US history and government questions and bang you\u2019ve got US citizenship",

Obviously Trump just ended all of these programs (except for Ukrainians) but they've historically been an important part of immigration to US, and obviously come with many of their own challenges.  \n\nObviously structures of capital and white supremacy oftentimes govern who is deemed illegal/legal. Ukrainian humanitarian parolees (United for Ukraine program) provide an excellent case study. They are still \"legal\", but other, non-white groups such as Haitian/Cubans, Venezuelans and Hondurans, who had the exact same humanitarian parolee status under Biden, are now deemed \"illegal\". As Anarchists we know that borders are simply created to redirect the flow of capital and control/terrorize native populations.",
