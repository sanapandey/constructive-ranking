    "selftext": "80 years ago today, tankies (Red Army) marched into Auschwitz, freeing the survivors of a fascist, racist, capitalist, imperialist, and authoritarian  genocide that killed 10M+ Jews, Romanis, LGBTQs, Slavs, disabled, etc.\n\nNow, after 80 years, the same thing is happening everywhere. Russia is still raiding Ukraine, Chinese occupation of Tibet is getting WAY more brutal, Trump now in throne started implementing White nationalist policies against local Iroquoi, Cherokee, and Inuit populations.No one cares how Myanmar is messing with Rohingyas, Turkey doesn't stop bombarding Kurdish, Syriac(Assyrian), and Armenian villages in Syria, and last but not least, UN did nothing more than shouting \"Enough!\" when Israel was shooting at Gazan 2 years old babies.\n\nWhat I want to say is, we remember history not to prevent its reoccurrence in future, but to stop its extension right now.\n\nUh... let me end this article with the famous quote.\n\n\u201cMany of us like to ask ourselves, \u2018What would I do if I was alive during slavery? Or the Jim Crow South? Or apartheid? What would I do if my country was committing genocide?\u2019 The answer is, you\u2019re doing it. Right now.\u201d - Aaron Bushnell, 1998-2024",

When we try to turn the truth into convenient myths/propaganda, we often erase the most important parts of it.\n\nRecommending everyone read \u201cBlessed is the Flame\u201d by Serafinski because folks weren\u2019t just sitting there waiting to be saved.\n\nResistance *within* the camps was a huge factor in ending the Holocaust and keeping folks alive in the meantime. Giving credit to an army that got there after folks had been fending for themselves for years, then left for dead by the fleeing fash, seems actively disrespectful. \n\nEspecially considering how that same army treated many of those folks after they were \u201cliberated\u201d. Any military is a violent enforcement arm of the state, and their motives were not altruistic.\n\nNo army is coming, there is no \u201cRevolutionary Vanguard\u201d or hero class coming to save everyone. Generally the left needs to lose the savior complex IMO and recognize that the real work of revolution is building community support networks with your neighbors-Locally, around you, in your neighborhood, in meatspace. \n\nThere is no march to glory, just the day-to-day of collaborating for survival.\n\nWe also need to stop acting like performing the witnessing of suffering and being able to dramatically recite a list of atrocities is the same thing as actually doing something about it.\n\nWanna remember the Holocaust? Don\u2019t make a stupid fucking internet speech for karma, go make soup for your neighbors and talk to them about making a community defense group while yall eat together.\n\nAlso it\u2019s \u201cRomani\u201d - we don\u2019t conjugate it like an English word, because it\u2019s not an English word.",
