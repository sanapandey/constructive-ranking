            "body": "Thank you for grounding anarchist ideals with this question about daily (self) care. This is essential for actual transformation!\n\nPersonally, I find meditation to be a profoundly anarchic practice of learning not to believe the internalised authorities in my mind, but instead to listen to the deep inner wisdom of the Heart. This way my actions become more direct and less indirect reactions. \n\nOne of the ways I care for others is sharing this skill and helping to develop cooperative communities of heart-centred, empowering writers and others. As a former academic, I'm feeling called to offer something especially for academics who are freaking out right now in the US & UK and probably more places. \n\nI also help out in the after-school club at my local primy school which is really great fun. Working with kids is very humbling and also good practice in his to be a kind, cooperative \"authority\" figure.\n\nTeaching yoga is another way of bath caring for others and helping us all to embody liberation, not just think about it. I had no idea how much trauma and oppression I held in my body until it began to drop away! Seeing how heart-centred yoga can help people find the strength to walk away from abusive relationships, change their career paths, become more involved in their communities and become more centred and therefore harder to manipulate is deeply inspiring.\n\nI could do with making sure I have more time to play - dancing, singing, drawing, wandering outside without a plan. I find it easy to keep busy and look at screens to much. Prioritising reading inspiring novels has helped some with the screen addiction when realised what I was missing out on. \n\nI could go on, but hopefully what I've shared might help at least one person.",

There\u2019s also a pretty progressive food bank/community garden that I want to get in touch with, and I\u2019m planning on divesting from my bank and getting in with a credit union soon\n\nI also recently decided to finally go straight edge and to cut out alcohol and weed, as I was using it as a crutch to deal with my anxiety. I\u2019m trying to be healthier overall (and get better at fighting fascists) so I started training at my local BJJ gym, which has been exhausting but great exercise\n\nThe biggest thing I\u2019ve been doing lately though has been trying to cut Big Tech and other capitalist nonsense out of my life. I\u2019ve cut Amazon, Instagram, Messenger, Twitter, Facebook, Google Chrome, Spotify, Disney+, Prime, am planning to replace my iPhone/Windows desktop with Graphene/Linux, respectively and will be replacing Microsoft Office with LibreOffice, Gmail/Outlook with SmartMail and am using a VPN all the time. I\u2019m exploring Open Source tech and it\u2019s applications to anarchism and am finding it really exciting so far!\n\nAll in all trying to use these uncertain times to better myself, help my community and cut capitalism out from my life as much as possible.
