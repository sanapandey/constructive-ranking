            "body": "1) Makhno and Arshinov created the Platform after what they saw as the failure of anarchism in the face of Bolshevik vanguardism. The main issue they noted was a lack of organization and coordination on behalf of the anarchists. The Platform seeks to be a blueprint for tactical unity among anarchists without falling into the authoritarian pitfalls of vanguardism. Both a vanguard cadre and a platformist org seek to train dedicated political militants to participate in (and in the former\u2019s case seize control of) mass movement organizations. Usually the goal of a Marxist vanguard is to infiltrate these groups and take any positions of leadership to steer these groups along their lines. Platform anarchists do not seek to take control of other groups, but instead influence them by demonstrating the efficacy of anarchist tactics and prove the discipline and reliability of anarchist militants (\u201csocial insertion\u201d in the especifista tradition.) Another major difference is a vanguard usually receives their orders and their \u201ccorrect line\u201d from some central committee or authority over them. Platform anarchists come to their agreed upon tactics and analysis collectively through the participation and discussion of all its membership. There are many other differences, but these are two of the biggest imo.\n\n2) It\u2019s arguable that much of the early criticism to the Platform was due to poor quality translations from the original Russian and a lot of interpersonal beef within the anarchist movement at that time, particularly among many Russian/Ukrainian anarchist exiles (chief among them Mahkno and Voline.) Synthesis anarchism seeks to build a \u201cbig tent\u201d style anarchism that brings all flavors of anarchism (communist, syndicalist, individualist, mutualist, etc.) under a single banner. This was created in reaction to the Platform\u2019s call for a more unified anarchist organization that had a limited, but agreed upon set of tactics and achieving this through a democratic process when consensus was not possible. Mahkno argued synthesis anarchism watered down the efficacy of anarchists by trying to fit so many conflicting schools into a single group. He would argue that if you have 10 different factions within a synthesis grouping that have 10 different tactics in a given situation (some of them contradicting others) then you\u2019re not making any serious impact in any one direction. Famously, Malatesta initially disapproved of the Platform, but after many of the translation issues were worked upon and a more nuanced form the Platform was understood Malatesta came around to support the project. Seeing as how synthesis anarchism has dominated western anarchist spaces for almost a century, and the sad state of the anarchist movement in the west, I\u2019d argue Mahkno\u2019s criticisms were valid.\n\n3) Alongside Fauer, the other principal author of synthesis anarchism was Voline, a long time comrade who fought alongside the Mahknovists before he was eventually captured by Bolshevik forces. Mahkno and Voline famously had a bad relationship at this point and openly attacked each other in publications and at public meetings. Other famous anarchists like Berkman actively tried to get them to squash the beef to no avail. Mahkno accused Voline of being an armchair anarchist, while Voline called Mahkno an authoritarian. While I\u2019m sure there were theoretical differences between Voline and Mahkno I do think interpersonal differences were sadly a much larger contributing factor to their falling out. Same with Arshinov, though for more pragmatic reasons. Arshinov\u2019s family was very unhappy in exile in Paris and his wife urged him to reconcile with the Bolsheviks so they could return home to Russia. Some argue that Arshinov\u2019s disavowal of anarchism entirely was to this end. Arshinov was finally allowed to return home to Russia where he worked with the Bolsheviks until being purged by Stalin in 1925.\n\n4) Platformism is more relevant than ever today and is on the rise globally. For the past 100 years the majority of anarchist activists have embraced a synthesis model and balked at any serious and dedicated organizing structures. (At least that is my experience here in the US.) This, along with anarchism being relegated to mostly subcultural spaces, has meant anarchists have had very little visible presence in mass social movements for a very very long time. Sure you can point to anarchists being involved in most major public upheavals but this rarely goes beyond spectacle to the more serious, and less sexy, work of slowly building lasting mass movements (which have to include everyone, not just anarchists.) Not every anarchist needs to be in a Platformist org, but we do need orgs with the goal to train serious political militants in anarchists tactics, who can then teach these skills to and build relationships with other anarchists and the masses of people generally.\n\nEdit: grammar",

            "body": "generally speaking, a vanguard party's goal is more to control the movement, while platformism is more about influencing it.\n\nVanguardism has led to hierarchical leadership and authority over the proletariat, their goal is to seize state power through democratic centralism, which has led to the ruling of the party with very little participation of the masses. \n\nPlatformism on the other hand tries to promote participation instead, coordination is supposed to be done voluntarily and the goal is the abolition of the state and self-managed communes / federalism instead, as to promote participation and collective decision making in a more horizontal way. \n\nThe similarities is more that they both see the need for an organised and coherent (disciplined) group of people to guide the revolution, and they usually aren't very fond of spontaneity.\n\nGenerally speaking, anarchists of many tendencies criticise platformism because... well, the Bolsheviks also claimed it would be voluntary and everything would be fine, so many anarchists are very wary about platformism leading to the same kind of problems. Even without a formal hierarchy, the theoretical homogeneity they promote *could* still lead to a form of authoritarianism where some elite can impose their own vision of what's \"best\", it can also exclude other anarchist organisations and lead to a form of sectarianism instead of cooperation, and it reduces the potential for more creative or even spontaneous approaches when facing new challenges. \n\nBasically, it could prevent you from thinking outside the box, it could lead to a form of conformity, a new status quo, and it could open up the door for co-optation and opportunism. Those are mostly speculations but I think they make sense. Some are also broad generalisation since neither vanguardism nor platformism is a monolith, many of these groups recognise the historical problems and potential issues so they try to address it through different approaches. \n\nI am not familiar enough with Sebastien Faure so I don't want to give you false informations, but a quick skimming through his work makes me feel like he is mostly criticising the sectarianism he's perceiving in the anarchist movement, and he's promoting diversity of tactics instead of a more disciplined organisation like platformism. Again I'm not familiar with it though so I might be wrong. \n\nI don't have enough confidence in my own knowledge to reply to point 3 and 4 in an insightful or accurate manner either, I wish you luck in your search for informations tho!",

                            "body": "Allegedly, but that isn't what a vanguard party actually does. I'll speak from experience here in how a vanguard and a specifically anarchist group operate.\n\nA vanguard party will typically come into a mass organization, such as a union, and try to seek officer roles within it, or get their party cadre hired as staff so they can have the membership's dues pay for one of their people to be a full-time activist. Vanguards typically do not do deep organizing of the rank and file, and instead just mobilize the membership for this or that action. When they do bother educating the rank and file, it is typically by treating them as an empty vessel to be filled with the right political line, or among the more advanced Maoist sects, to engage in some form of \"mass line\" with, but not actual reciprocal, conversational methods of co-learning. Often, the disengagement of the rank and file is advantageous to the vanguard, because it allows them to pass all sorts of very radical sounding resolutions with the voice of the union- though, these resolutions do nothing, just as most of the actions they mobilize people to (rallies and marches) do nothing. Because they don't actually organize the rank and file into a militant, radical, self-organized force, vanguard parties can't usually win an actual confrontation with the state or the boss. So, they have to constantly walk a line between semi-radical rhetoric, and action that is radical is aesthetic but liberal in form: Lots of red flags at rallies and marches, but no direct action, no plan beyond marching from point A to point B, no real political vision. They tell themselves they are radicals pretending to be liberals. They are actually liberals, pretending to be radicals, pretending to be liberals.\n\nThe vanguard parties of the contemporary left are essentially parasitic organizations (I mean this as material analysis, not slander- this is how their orgs relate to mass orgs) within the broader mass organizations of the class, taking spots within the bureaucratic layers in order to eat up dues money and take up positions of power. They also like to take over smaller community organization and turn them into front groups, but in the process usually drain the democratic vitality and member engagement out of those groups. It is essentially predatory behavior. In their political vision- which they can never reach because they don't actually organize, just mobilize- they would be the leaders of the revolution and the ruling party after the revolution, which would enable them to continue their bureaucratic role.\n\nA specific anarchist organization, on the other hand, generally will have our membership be in the rank and file of a union or be regular participants in community organizations. We do not try to take these organizations over by seizing positions of power within them, and then implement anarchist ideas. Instead, we try to win the rank and file of the organizations over to an anarchist analysis and normalize anarchist methods of struggle such as direct action. We work to create a leadership of ideas, not of people. One little-covered fact about this in recent history, is that it was largely anarchists and especially anarchists of color in Minneapolis who normalized and spread ideas of abolition and militancy in the community in the years before the Uprising in 2020. It was also anarchists who popularized the term \"community self defense\" or \"community defense\", and the idea of a general strike (both in general, and in various specific cases, such as the time we almost got one to happen in Wisconsin in 2011 before the Dems outmanuevered us in the institutions). Anarchist concepts and practices get spread far beyond our small numbers, and our position in the rank and file rather than in the bureaucracy actually helps, rather than hinders, this spread.\n\nWhen anarchists lose a vote in a big, democratic mass organization, we don't try to stuff the meetings, capture offices, and figure out bureaucratic work-arounds to the members' will. We take it as a sign that our ideas aren't popular yet and we need to organize harder and convince more people, or demonstrate the value of our ideas by acting autonomously (such as through shop floor direct action, or an autonomous demonstration). We try to make the organizations we are in more democratic/horizontal,  more friendly to autonomous action by workers, and know that in such an environment, our radical analysis and our militant tactics are likely to spread and be adopted by more and more people.\n\nVanguardists view the masses as people who need to be led by them, shaped by them, and disciplined by them once they are in power. Anarchists view ourselves as a militant part of \"the masses\" who are spreading militancy, radical analysis, and a revolutionary will through our relationships, our organizing, and our actions. When our vision of revolution happens, we won't be leading it- we will have been superseded by the self-organization of this whole ecosystem of relationships and organizations and projects around us, ready to burst through the shell of the old world when that shell is weakened by the recurring crises it faces.\n\n  \nEdit: For disclosure and clarification, I am a current member of an anarchist collective that isn't officially platformist, but is functionally especifist. I'm also a former member of a synthesist anarchist alliance that had collectives in several Rust Belt cities, where we were for a number of years fairly influential in labor, tenant, and CSD work. Neither one of these collectives self-identified as platformist or especifist, but in a lot of ways, our work came to organically evolve into a sort of especifist praxis.",

Perhaps, the anarchist organizing of a vanguard is completely different? if it's not wrong to assume?, because from what you have stated, the primary function of a vanguard in terms of organization is to simply make partial members into full time, committed members of that local org or activist grp, rather then regulate the entire structure.",

In power, a vanguard party makes a claim to represent the masses, to speak on our behalf. It operates under a top down approach and pushes centralization. This makes the \"actual existing socialist\" state not terribly responsive to complaints and demands for reform from below, which makes it much harder for it to actually address the internal contradictions of the society it governs. It also leads to the growth of a self-interested layer within the party itself, who typically come to the realization that they could be even more powerful if they sold off the state's industries to themselves and their buddies, and called it \"Socialism with \\[Insert Country Name Here\\] Characteristics\". \n\nThe anarchist organizing of an anarchist group is definitely completely different. We make no claim to represent anyone but ourselves, we operate within \"the masses\", we build from the bottom up, and we encourage the growth of distributed networks of resistance where many people can take coordinated action not through a top-down leader, but through many poles of initiative.\n\nIn the contemporary west, though, vanguard parties are not in power, and have basically no viable way to get into power. Instead, they eke out an existence attaching themselves to the unions, devouring small local community groups, and never building the power to actually decisively break with the liberal/center-left and take revolutionary action.",

Anarcho-communism has federative organizing as one of its main organizational principles, and platformists are by definition anarcho-communists. The differences between platformism and democratic confederalism are more wide ranging.   \n  \nDC does not generally put the working class or the workers and peasants as the main agents of revolution, as platformism is more wont to do (though that has developed in other directions, with less strict class focus, in the decades since Makhno). DC is the specific political tendency of the Kurdish revolutionary movement around the PKK, and is informed by Bookchin's communalism but not simply a copy-paste of it. Platformism, on the other hand, is not specific to one context or group or struggle, but is a proposed set of common principles for anarchists around the world that has been used as a reference point for decades. DC also has a lot more to say about ecology and feminism than platformism does. I mean, I could list a lot of differences, but the two are just sort of different beasts overall. DC is a system of social organization, a new social order that is being constructed (under siege) in Rojava. Platformism is a method of anarchist organizing- not a prescription for how the anarchist society should be structured, but a strategic orientation for how to build our movement and carry out revolution.   \n  \nDC is broadly within the libertarian left, and many platformists admire and defend the revolution in Rojava, though it is generally \"critical support\", meaning support that comes with some caveats and criticisms.",

Because voline believed unity among anarchists to form a synthesis of anarchism, which will need Constant self-criticism from different anarchist schools of thought within an organization. \n\nI think i explained it's criticism on 2. But biggest problem is, platformism restricts anarchist organization to have one school of thought and makes anarchist organization way more smaller. Which is bad, since you need a good amount of people to actually have direct action.\n\nAlso bad translation and bad word selection in original text was responsible to the huge criticism at the time. \n\n4.
