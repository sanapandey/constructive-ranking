Im degrading people who promote boycotting rather than switching to vegan and going car free and shopping exclusively local. It is literally not that hard. ",

Eat healthy less as a form of boycot and more for your own health. Anarchists do tend to prefer more direct methods of change",

If someone rides their bike most of the time but drives a car to get groceries during a storm are they awful? I used to buy gas once a week and now I buy it once a month or less. People can make choices that are less than complete abstinence and make an impact.",

            "body": "Because TARGETED boycotts can be effective. It's not about refusing to buy a broad category of products indefinitely, or for a specific defined period of time as a symbol of protest, or anything like that. It's about targeting a specific company and putting economic pressure on them so that they have to listen to the demands of consumers. Ideally a boycott has a lot of people behind it who are all refusing to buy one specific product, even better if it is something they buy often and would in theory go back to buying if the company in question corrects the problem that spurred the boycott. The demand should be clear and resolvable and the boycott ends when the demand is met.\n\nIf you want to personally avoid purchasing an entire category of products because of environmental concerns or anything else, that's not a boycott. That's simply you deciding not to support a certain industry or type of product that you don't think should exist at all. Vegans aren't \"boycotting\" meat. That would imply that there is some demand that meat producers could comply with that would make vegans decide to start buying and eating meat again.",

You make think that any support of capitalism at all is unethical but that is irrelevant to what a boycott is and does. A boycott is pressure from people who would otherwise be customers of the company being boycotted. The whole point is that there is an incentive for that company to change something in response to the boycott. The group calling for the boycott WILL go back to purchasing those products when their demands are met because it's not the product that they see as unethical, it's something specific that the company is doing. A company will never respond to demands from people who aren't buying their products in the first place. \n\nYour belief that no one should ever buy gasoline, or a car, or order from Amazon. or whatever it is, is your political belief, and could be debated, but it has nothing to do with boycotts. If you aren't a consumer, you also have no consumer power. A boycott is a tool of consumers.",
