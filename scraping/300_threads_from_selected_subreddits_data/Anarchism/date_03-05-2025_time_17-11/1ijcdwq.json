It's hard to tell from the Wikipedia description whether it is sarcastic or sincere:\n\n>American democracy is a failed experiment that should be replaced by an accountable monarchy, similar to the governance structure of corporations.\n\nWhile I can't see this happening in reality, I could seriously see Americans liking it. It feels like so many people here, both USians and middle class Latin Americans, are quicker to fear or demonize the \"other\" than to elicit any kind of deeper commitment to the greater good, even though they may be \"charitable\" as long as it doesn't threaten power structures that keep them segregated. \n\nAnd on an interpersonal level, organizing people here without a pay-based structure is nigh impossible. It's nearly impossible to get anyone, particularly bosses, to move toward collaborative decision making models.\n\nOk, I'm done venting my frustration with US politics. \n\nThe other thing your post made me think of is [Stafford Beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Beer?wprov=sfla1), the British systems guy who nearly set up a communist digital governance platform in Chile. It was being implemented when the US carried out the 1973 Pinochet coup.",

A hundred thousand is already a lot though, so I'd strongly suggest you make a backup plan for what all those people could do, if you don't reach your target number of sign-ups. I'd also suggest (if you haven't already) you make some back-up plan for if your website is taken down, discord blocked, etc. That kind of thing also happened to us around 2011 when planning action against austerity. They will cut off your comms at the worst possible moment for you, so be prepared\n\n\n\nAlso, the research quoted on that website re \"We need 3.5% of the population...\" has been quite widely debunked in leftist circles, so you might want to re-word that, see - https://libcom.org/article/has-xr-successful-strategy-save-planet\n\n\nThe fact is that the ability of a general strike to affect change isn't based on numbers alone but on whether critical industries continue to function. A strike of 1% could win, if that 1% was mainly in the logistics industry. A strike of 10% could fail, if it's in non-critical industries\n\nIt's also not clear how long the strike will last? In the UK we once had a general strike of 9 days (in 1926). Then the leadership called it off and it ended without winning *anything*. Imo you need to be clear to people that this isn't just a one-day thing. It could be a rolling strike for example - if one day doesn't work, wait a week, then go indefinitely. This would make it significantly more likely for the rich and powerful to concede, prior to any action taking place\n\n\n\nIdk if the history is useful to you? It might be helpful, so I'll share it. The first time anyone wrote about general strikes was on 1832, in this pamphlet by William Benbow https://www.marxists.org/history/england/chartists/benbow-congress.htm . It's a bit archaic but he writes about the logistics of it and how it could work. This idea got a lot of traction and in 1839, it was actually attempted. Unfortunately it didn't work out - https://libcom.org/library/chartiist-grand-national-holiday-general-strike-1839 . The end of that article also has a very good discussion of Rosa Luxemborg's 1905 article The Mass Strike, which might give you some useful things to think about. Even if your current plans don't work out, it's still quite possible there will be strike waves under Trump - the infrastructure you are building now could be used to support and spread such strikes, turning them into a \"spontaneous\" general strike, IF you can organise well and keep people on board. Hope that helps!",

            "body": "You don't need 3.5% of the population. That's a number that keeps getting bandied around and has no basis in reality. What you need is organized workplaces, in key sectors such as transport, steel, and energy, with a tradition of militant struggle and robustly democratic unions. Failing that, the best you can hope for is a spontaneous, viral, wildcat general strike, which- and I must emphasize this- is not something you can organize. \n\nThose of us who come from the syndicalist tradition have been trying to lay the groundwork for this kind of strike forever, but that groundwork involves actually organizing at the point of production, as rank and file workers. The vast majority of the left is unwilling to do that, preferring instead to ambulance-chase picket lines, to play entryism into the union bureaucracies, to pass resolutionary-socialist statements with minor committees within the unions, and to do every sort of protest, action, and mobilization except for organizing at the point of production. So, big surprise, we don't have the ability to throw the glorious punch to the boss's face that is a general strike, because every generation of leftists for the last 80 years has been trying to throw these wild haymakers without putting in the work to build up the muscle to land it.",

Now, I want to share an experience we had when, in 2020, people called for a general rent strike in our metro. There was a ton of energy around it, and most of that energy was focusing on making art and social media content about it, on gathering people into big social media groups, and trying to figure out what the critical mass was of people who needed to go out on rent strike for it to work. A lot of people wanted to go on rent strike, but none of their co-tenants were on board, and so they were scared of taking action if they were going to be the only one in their building going out.   \n  \nA handful of people were insistent on saying, \"We need to build committees. We have to organize company by company and neighborhood by neighborhood. We need to talk to our neighbors who aren't activists. We'll figure out grievances they have and add them to demands. We need to do a less escalatory action than a full strike at first, to show that we have the numbers and support and get people ready for a full strike. If rent day comes and we're not organized into committees by company, people are going to cave, and pay their rent\".   \n  \nSome people listened to the committee-builder folks, and started building committees. A lot of people didn't. It sounded like a lot of work, and besides, who were these people with their ideas about committees and talking to neighbors, to come along and tell everyone what to do? Some people got really mad at the committee-builders and said we needed to stop taking up so much space with our efforts to organize a rent strike in the rent strike social media groups.   \n  \nAt first, only one or two committees got built, while the energy of the first big, excited wave dissipated. Rent day came and most people paid their rent, because making social media posts about a rent strike and organizing a rent strike aren't the same thing.   \n  \nLater, a handful of committees got built, and started trying to federate. It was hard, because most of the people who were excited about a rent strike had drifted away now and were excited about the next big mobilization everyone was talking about. Eventually, the effort petered out.  \n  \n If you want a rent strike, you have to organize tenants in their apartment buildings and neighborhoods. If you want a general strike, you have to organize workplaces. At the point of production.   \n  \nThis is not a call to abandon the idea of a general strike. This is a call to say, \"If you're serious about wanting to do this, let's do the serious work it requires\".",
