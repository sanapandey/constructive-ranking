Leftists have been outraged for centuries. Leftists understand that Trump will make things worse faster, but also understand the situation was already abysmal and would continue to be if Harris won. They understand both parties really reflect the interests of one group; the bourgeoisie. \n\nSo they\u2019re \u201cjust vibing\u201d the same way they were before the election. It\u2019s emotionally unsustainable to be overwhelmed with anger your entire lives; most leftists are outraged, as they are with the genocide in Gaza. Or as they were with the war in Afghanistan, or the detention centers on the border, or the war in Iraq and the torture camps there, or in Afghanistan, or with Guantanamo bay, Korea and Vietnam, Panama, etc etc; leftists are outraged, but it\u2019d be unfair to expect them to be incapable of experiencing joy literally their entire lives - they find ways to be happy despite the awful reality. They get used to being outraged the best they can. This political anger is new to liberals as it was in 2020, but it isn\u2019t new to leftists. \n\nDespite this, for centuries, leftists have been partaking in meaningful activism, mutual aid, organization, for centuries, no matter who was president at the time. Don\u2019t get the idea they don\u2019t care or have given up. They just don\u2019t *stop* caring when a Democrat is president and *start* caring when a Republican is president. They\u2019ve been battling deportation under Obama and Biden just as they did and are under Trump; were liberals? \n\nI\u2019d be less concerned with leftists not being angry 24/7, than I would be with the idea Liberals were going to *celebrate* the election of a President who partook in displacing 2,100,000+ civilians in Gaza for capital interests, who let Roe v Wade be overturned and didn\u2019t codify anything to replace it (despite promising to), who didn\u2019t give appropriate aid to those *still* suffering in North Carolina, etc etc etc. They were ready to pop the champagne.\n\nThere were calls to action and activism and protests and aid groups and organizations before Trump got elected; they still exist. We\u2019re continuing to do what we were doing before.\n\nMany of us saw trump getting elected from a mile away. It was upsetting but not surprising. Our strategies and goals are pretty much the same as they were beforehand. Deportations and the stripping away of rights and concentration camps and billionaire corruption were all happening long before trump.",
