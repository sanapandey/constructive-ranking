    "selftext": "I had a dream last week. I was a child, and in the center of my childhood bedroom there was a rattlesnake coiled up and waiting. I called for mom. Someone came but it wasn't my mom. My real mom had killed rattlesnakes when I was a kid to protect us. One time, she sliced one into pieces with the blade of a shovel.But this imposter mom was worried about the snake's health. It used a roll of paper towels to gather the snake up. \"No,\" I complained, \"it'll bite you through the towel, what are you doing?! Why?!\" But she didn't listen. This was not my mom.  \n  \nShe took it out the front door and released the snake not ten feet from the door in some misguided catch-and-release nonsense. The snake rushed toward me and I woke up screaming.My therapist thinks the 'mom' in this dream was my perception of the DNC and oppositional establishment in the US. I agree. I am a politically disenfranchised person and only have one vote. I rely on broader civil society to protect me from discrimination and harm. They seem to have failed me, lately.My real mom just spoke to me today. She shared a dream she had on Wednesday. She dreamed of a giant Trump head in a MAGA hat attached to the body of a giant snake looming over her in darkness. At her side was a female family member, maybe me, maybe her sister, or my sister. My mom shouted \"GRAB A POLE!\" and together, she and the other woman started bashing the snake.  \n  \nMy mom said she saw the face's cheeks puff up and distort and then she realized that's where she had to strike. She smashed through it with the pole, describing it to me on the phone as 'that grisly resistance feeling you get when you cut through an animal' (I love my mother). Then the snake dissolved.  \n  \nWe then talked about meaningful action, and how the destruction of this evil has to come not from our American left, but the world, because if it comes from only us, they will continue to denounce and deflect and lie and claim conspiracy.  \n  \nThis is a global threat. And I love my mom. And I know she, a woman of influence and consequence, is connected with men, women, laborers, and policy makers here in Washington who all despise this administration and are committed to real action.  \n  \nMy mom is contemplating actions I've never heard her discuss with a real fire. I'm proud of her.  \n  \nAnd I feel a lot better about that fucking snake, now.",
