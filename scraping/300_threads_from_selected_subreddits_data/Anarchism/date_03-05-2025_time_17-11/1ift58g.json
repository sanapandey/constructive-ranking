Liberals and \"moderate\" conservatives are alleged of \"communist sympathizers\", and [the riot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Seoul_Western_District_Court_riot) already did occur.\n\n[\\(From top left: Holodomor, Khmer Rouges, Cultural Revolution, 1989 Tiananmen Massacre, 2019 Hong Kong Revolution, North Korea, Congress of CCP, Soviet nostalgic sympathizers in Donetsk, and Hezbollah militants\\)](https://preview.redd.it/fpj9khdqsoge1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdc99f99384d32e9d2dac7715d4a8d47d11872e4)\n\n[\\(From top left: Paris Commune, Ukrainian Makhnovists, Kronstadt sailors, Korean People's Association in Manchuria \\(KPAM\\) politicians, CNT-FAI workers, Black Panther Party, Zapatistas, Kurdish YPJ, and Syriac\\/Assyrian HSNB\\)](https://preview.redd.it/5t8rjpr4toge1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=497fb92e573d69cc67bb934252b66e0a7fece6d7)\n\nThese incidents are, of course, because fear of \"communist\" states such as NK and China taking over South Korea.\n\nWhen I say the word \"socialism\" in South Korea, most of my compatriots think of Aoji Coal Mine in North Korea, Gulag, or Tiananmen Square. Such fear and bias are often affiliated with anti-Chinese, anti-Taiwanese and anti-Singaporean racism (because China is a Dengist \"communist\" country), thus fueling far-right politics in my motherland.\n\n(Sigh) You might feel as if my motherland is irredeemably reactionary. However, trust me - I have a cool idea or two of even I, as a teenager, can re-educate my compatriots from \"Red Terror\". Though we might be segregated in South Korea, North Korea, China, Japan, Russia, Uzbekistan, etc. we Koreans are as strong as steel and as resilient as rubber bands. We will overcome McCarthyism, topple down conservative and liberal reactionaries, revitalize the spirit of [KPAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_People%27s_Association_in_Manchuria), and free ourselves and our motherland!",
