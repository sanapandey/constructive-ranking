Is this something a hobbyist with a soldering iron (me) could do without electrocuting themselves or breaking the law (since there might be laws about keeping video if the camera can see into a neighbor\u2019s property from the angle it\u2019s at)?\n\nThanks!\n\nNEXT DAY EDIT: Thank you all so much for the great suggestions! I think I\u2019m going to set up a hardwired system like one of the ones suggested. Now I just need to research the best one.",

The control box will link to any computer monitor/tv and will record either everything with a self rewrite over a given period of time, or it can record events (adjust sensitivity) such as movement etc.\n\nIt\u2019s really easy and not expensive. Hardest part is fitting the cameras, but they can also be inside (though be wary of reflections from windows)",

            "body": "It's been a while since I looked but there are some off brand systems that use a sim card (basically a stationary pre-smart phone cell phone built into the control pad) to call preprogrammed numbers and deliver (at least) audio of what's going on in your house after the alarm's been tripped. So iow there's no monthly fee or monitoring service as long as you use a prepaid sim -- so no cops involved. These are generally modular kits that include window and door sensors, movement sensors, glass break sensors etc. And I would imagine higher end ones have cameras too. There are even systems that include the option for networked fire and/or flood alarms which can be useful. And of course the audible alarm part. Some of them include the option to remotely talk to or yell at the person who broke into your house! \n\nI'm including an [example](https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Security-Detector-Notifications-Compatible/dp/B09SZG3DC4?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=A1039P2GNFPVKE&gQT=1) but there are a lot of other options out there and I can't specifically vouch for this one. This is a giant rabbit hole that can eat up hours or days looking at all the options, so be aware of that.",

Wireless can get drowned out by jammers and never report an intrusion. \n\nI created my own security system using [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/). Hard to get better than that in terms of data privacy. It's definitely not for everyone though. It's a good route to go if you already have some IoT stuff.\n\nFor cameras: [Frigate NVR](https://frigate.video/). You can route lots of brands video feed into this, and it has the capability to detect pretty much anything from cars to insects to peeing dogs, but for the special stuff you need to train the recognition engine, which is an involved process if I remember correctly. \n\nFrigate has a Home Assistant integration so once you wire cameras up and send them through frigate, you can monitor those feeds through home assistant from your phone or even wall-mounted tablets, get notifications when the cameras identify something, run automations based on detections, etc. It's a fun tech stack. Vast majority of the coding is YAML with a sprinkling of Python, so it's simple to set up. And these days, pretty much everything in both systems can be done via the UI. \n\nYou can run both systems 24/7 on the same machine if you use a hypervisor like Proxmox.",

You can order them online and set up your own system. \n\nIn any decent sized city there are probably at least a few security system contractors left. You can get them to install a whole system, and simply leave out the part where it automatically dials them or the police if there's a break in. In old school security systems, all they used to do is simply dial their home office, and then their home office would call you and make sure that it wasn't a false alarm, and then call the police. But, you had to have an actual phone line for that. \n\nAnother option is to have an alarm system essentially have a cell phone built in that merely calls your cell phone. But, I don't know of any of those exist.\n\nSource, I used to work for a burglar alarm company. Essentially, it's nothing but an electronics circuit board that connects to a bunch of switches, and then sets off alarms if those switches aren't behaving the way the electronic circuit board expects them to. What those alarms do is kind of up to you.",
