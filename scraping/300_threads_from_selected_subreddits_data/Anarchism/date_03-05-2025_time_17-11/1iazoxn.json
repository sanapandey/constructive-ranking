    "selftext": "I keep an eye on this forum. However I see flaws in Revolutionary and Radical thought here. \n\nMost revolutionaries still have this ideal of a revolution being about Anarchist, Anticapitalist, Antiauthoritarians, overthrowing the system of State and Capitalism overnight through vanguard militarized action. When this is not only a power fantasy but it wouldn't be useful or effective on actually changing our material reality. It would only reproduced a Capitalist and Statist system.\n\nA revolution is a series of uprisings, resistances and revolts against current political system that exist which don't work or serve in favor of the masses. While we can't plan an Anarchist society, because it would be a finality, a revolution does take strong horizontal power structures and planning  and proper self-defense against Fascism and Statism. \n\nI feel as though it's easy to talk about revolution online and discuss theory, but it's takes more energy and effort to put in the praxis. For many people whether you're a radical or not, we often love the idea of community but lack motivation, energy or time commitment to craft the society we want to build, mostly due to a hyper individuallist society we already live under, we tend to pay attention more to our personal issues, which is valid. And revolutionary action isn't going to look the same for everyone, internationally we all deal with different varying degrees of oppression that need different solutions. When it comes to praxis there isn't a formula that fits everyone.\n\n\nIt's easy to be lazy in thinking and praxis about revolution especially for those that are already dealing with hyper individuallism and isolation. Which is my case as well. It's especially more of a challenge when there's a task of educating people on Anarchist views, the bedrock of revolution is people recognizeing their dialectic material conditions, learning about the oppressive institutions they must eradicate, and educating other people in the processes, forming mutal networks etc. However class consciousness, comes from societies having to experience the destructive natures of a system.\n\nIn the case of the American Empire it is in major decline and has been for decades, economic crisis, environmental crisis with climate change and illnesses, inflation, etc. it's an Empire that's in denial, and it's the working class that will suffer from the decline, not the Demagogues or the Capitalist. The problem is that many people still buy into the Electoral system every four years hoping for change because that's much easier than the effort of direct action for some. \n\nAnyway a bit of a rant, but I just find it weird and irritating how many people still have this belief that a revolution will happen overnight through militarized vanguard action when it's more complicated than that, and revolutionnary action isn't the same for all of us across the globe. I also find it extremely weird how some people believe the State will \"help\" in the  Anticapitalist and Antistatist revolution. History has shown that when there's any opposition that is a threat to the State that it will eliminate its opposition through force and coercion. ",

                    "body": "Let me copy an explanation of my anarchism here that I've just posted elsewhere, and see if you can get anything from it.\n\nAlright! It's a pretty expansive topic, so this will necessarily be oversimplifying a lot.\n\nTo start with, there are a few principles that any committed anarchist should hold on to, no matter what, to whatever degree is at all feasible under the circumstances they find themselves in. Those principles are:\n\n - means-ends-unity, aka the way you achieve your goals should be in line with the goals themselves. If you use violence to enforce non-violence, you've just become the new source of violence, and once that's a hammer you're willing to pick up, you'll start seeing nails everywhere. Not that most anarchists are categorically opposed to violence, it's just an example. A quote I really like by Malatesta goes something like \"if you set out on the high road, and take a wrong turn, you won't arrive at your destination, but where the road leads you.\"\n\n - free association, aka nobody forces anyone to be part of any particular group. Whether someone associates with a group is up to them, and the other members of the group. Pretty self explanatory.\n\n - consensus decision making, aka unlike majority rule, which fucks over the minority, in consensus decision making systems everyone has a veto right. Consensus is sought through discussion, and within groups of people who actually want to work together, so the incentive to find compromise is pretty high. Should it be impossible to find a solution everyone is alright with, a permanent split in the group may be necessary.\n\n - prefiguration, aka building the society we envision in the here, and now, or \"building the new in the shell of the old\". Means we don't just theorize, and pine after whatever wishful thoughts we've cooked up, but we build the institutions, and structures we want to the extent possible.\n\n - mutual aid, aka help where you can, and expect to be helped when necessary. Don't help others because you expect to benefit, but because it's the right thing to do, and you too will be helped because it's the right thing to do.\n\n\nThat's as far as many anarchists are willing to prescribe. I personally find it's a good foundation, but insufficient by itself, so let me speak on two social structures I believe to be crucial for the anarchist struggle.\n\n1st Communes: groups of up to a hundredish people who live together, share their day to day, share communal resources, and all their material wealth, and do a measure of economic activity together. Food, and artisan production, as well as childcare, and elderly care as well as housing of course are probably best situated in the context of the commune, though not all communes will be able to cover all these points.\n\n2nd Co-ops:  Currently also known as \"worker owned businesses\". What I have in mind goes a bit further than that. Where the commune provides the basic necessities, co-ops as I envision them are groups that form to address specific interests, and can, thanks to being single purpose, accommodate far greater numbers of people than communes. Co-ops are responsible for many things, from running rail networks, and factories to universities, and hospitals.\n\nSociety as a whole works via alliances, and confederations between communes, and co-ops. Free association both within, and between both entities result in an ever shifting tapestry of life that can provide a place for everyone. \n\nEveryone gets to be part of a real community with people who genuinely have their backs, and the work we do is self directed, and thus fun, rather than a chore most of the time.\n\nNo hierarchies mean that mutual distrust is low, and conspiracy theories will slowly die out. Genuine community means people develop real empathy, and bigotry will recede.\n\nSo how do we get there?\n\nAction, and patience. Join a commune, or found one, if there isn't one around. If there are multiple communes in an area, start networking. Between them, and look into founding co-ops. The goal isn't to be completely independent from capitalist society from the get go, but to work towards more, and more independence over time.\n\nBesides that, be kind to those not part of the movement. Help them, too, where you can. They'll remember it, and it might just give them the push they need to start looking into anarchism too.",

But on the topic of individualism I mean how Capitalism isolates us in a way that we are not focused on putting our energy in community, because we are focused on our individual well-being under Capitalism, and focused on trying to survive the system while putting in revolutionary praxis, which can be energy draining. I'm not saying people in this case should not be focused on surviving  the system or building horizontal networks, but that it takes balancing doing both at the same time. And yes in order for a community to work it takes the people within the community to work and focus on their well-being to help  others and their well-being within the community. It's why it takes balance without tiring ourselves out and giving into Capitalist individualism. But if we are to focus on revolutionary action for all of our communities we need balance of managing our health first, aka revolutionary self-care before we can give our energy to a community on a collective level. If we all experience burnout on an individual level, we can't be helpful to each other. \n\nAnd I agree with you on the topic of guns, there will come a time where militant revolutionary praxis is needed, but now is not that time. And I also believe it is foolish for anyone to accelerate conflict with the State and Fascist when it brings no fundamental change to the systems that currently exist, because it would just weaken the revolutionary movement. It's good to own firearms and know how to use them safely but not recklessly, or create unnecessary conflict with them. The purpose is only for self-defense in dire situations.",

The elitists using our government to maintain their wealth and power is capitalism. \n\nWe live in a capitalist world and the hardest thing to do is change the laws from private property ownership into protecting life. It's quite simple to the point they only allow the elect people who want to promote their hording of ownership. \n\nIn the history of humanity it's always the capitalist system that uses violence to get what they want. \n\n  \nWe are all born with ignorance and we need to help by getting word out of what government is and how to have a proper governance. Though we know that there are lots of failings in mob mentality it's also just apart of our human nature, socialism is already here but it's running on capitalism instead of anarchy. Capitalism is about control of ownership where as anarchy is about promoting the lives we're living. I really want to see a better foundation than that of capitalism.",

Additionally I think i see a lot of anarchists talking about strategizing and coordinating with other anarchists on a major scale - i think this just isn\u2019t possible or feasible. It goes against what makes anarchism works - the autonomy and freedom to practice the anarchy you believe, and having a unified front of anarchists would both remove this freedom and make resistance easier to crush by the state.",

Knowing how to better your workplace is tough, there is push back. Training on this can be good to even be able to know your own rights and advise others. If you live in an apartment complex... Invite tenants to a tenant association mtg and feel like you can build a sense of trust in your neighbors... Those are some strategies I think make it easier to get to know people from all backgrounds, it's true we must reach to all our people under the throttle of this state and ask them to question the logic of it as being necessary.\u00a0",
