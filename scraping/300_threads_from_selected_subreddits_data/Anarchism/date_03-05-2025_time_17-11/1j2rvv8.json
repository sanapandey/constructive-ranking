    "selftext": "I just had a thought that I need to have a bunch of anti-fascist, pro lgbtq, pro-immigration/anti ICE, pro choice, anti war, anti trump, anti corporation stickers & posters to put all around town. I\u2019m not an artist\u2026 but I do have a printer and a laminator. I\u2019d love to spend time riding around by bike and distributing this stuff around town. \n\nI\u2019m also down to spread some zines around and stash them in little free libraries and community hubs. \n\nAnyone know of resources that anyone might already have and could share/allow access to the material? I can print any digital files. Or if someone has a bunch of great zines I could consider purchasing them (limited funds though)\n\nI know I can make my own and I think the task feels a bit daunting. I want to do what I can in a cost effective way. \n\n\n*I\u2019m located in the U.S. in a small liberal city in the south in a right wing state. My city is surrounded by rural conservatives. In one day alone, I\u2019ve seen that there have been reports of ICE raids, nazis walking around in full uniform, and anti gender affirming care church meetings. And this was just from one mutual aid group I\u2019m in. Obviously there\u2019s more going on here than just what I mentioned. It\u2019s feeling dire.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m actively engaging with my community and politics in other ways. I\u2019m just thinking creatively about other things I can do ",
