    "selftext": "I am a disabled, trans, and queer adult living in the US right now. My parents recently brought up us leaving due to the recent election. Part of me agrees because we don\u2019t want to be those people who get stuck in a dying country, but the rest of me feels it\u2019s wrong, that we should stay here and fight for our rights and against the oppression of the government we\u2019re seeing right now.\n\nBut, I cannot physically go to protests or sit ins. My health is deteriorating, and because of the way insurance is here, I can\u2019t get it right now so I\u2019m just not alright, basically. I\u2019ve done everything I can think of (signing petitions, sharing information, sending letters, etc.) that doesn\u2019t put my health at risk. Beyond that, fucking hell, rights are being taken away left and right.\n\nIs it cowardly to consider leaving? To leave for the sake of keeping myself and my family safe, and abandon everyone here to the wolves?\n\nEdit because I realized this wasn\u2019t specified: This is 3/4ths pipe dream. We aren\u2019t very privileged people, we aren\u2019t rich, but the thought of this makes me feel wrong even if it never comes to fruition or turns out impossible.\n\nEdit two: I can\u2019t respond to everyone, but damn, thank you all for taking the time to respond. I\u2019ve read all of them. I think this is also a great post for people who have been struggling with similar feelings. Keep fighting, everyone.",

Lenin's idea of dual power has supplanted Kropotkin's idea of mutual aid for the platformists, they are more concerned about their own organizational staying power than the staying power of anarchism and anarchist principles. \n\nThe fact that people chose to model their organizations around such a defeatist document as the Organizational Platform... a document that has produced nothing of substance to anarchist organization is also just weird. Even Makhno himself did all of his major anarchist organizing before he became a platformist. It was rightfully condemned by Malatesta, Faure and others. Even Maximoff  became disillusioned with the idea. The platform was written at a time when it seemed like the principles of Bolshevikism was inevitable; those of us who have lived beyond the fall of the U.S.S.R. can easily see the flaw in this rationale -- indeed it was that very organizational structure that led to the ultimate collapse of the U.S.S.R. \n\nIt saddens me how many organizations are built around platformism, it makes them unable to be relevant in our times when decentralization and meeting people where they're at are whats necessary to grow anarchism beyond some niche subculture and into a movement that is relevant to peoples lives.",

It also defines how the group plans to federate to create a wider network of autonomous groups coordinated by using the same platform. \n\nA platformist organization is built on those four basic principles: Theoretical Unity, Tactical Unity, Collective Responsibility, and Federalism.\n\nIn the first meetings of writing the platform, the group will make fundamental decisions that will focus the group and its resources exclusively to certain tactics. This narrow focus avoids the problem of spreading too thin and creating confusion about what the plan is. I call it the too many cooks (tactics) in the kitchen problem.\n\nFor example: whether to pursue the tactic of radicalizing unions to usurp the control of capital. It is a tactic aligned with the group's unified goal of overthrowing capitalism. But, for example, let's say that in this group's theoretical framework that they've agreed that private capital and the state have and will inevitably co-opt all unions because negotiating power with capital validates capital. So, syndicalism and any other form of radical trade unionism is probably not going to be a tactic that their platform will support. So now that discussion is over.  No one will waste future meeting time arguing about whether to pursue that tactic of organizing unions.\n\nThe group can edit the platform if they collectively decide to do so.  But, the goal is to get everyone on the same page to achieve a goal, not to debate on best ways to do that every meeting.\n\nPlease let me know if you have questions",

                    "body": "Beyond just \"it's not a good idea,\" it's also incredibly unlikely to work out if she wants to be able to legally live and work in another country. \n\nThat means you don't need to discourage her - just encourage her to do some research into exactly how to immigrate to the countries she'd like to move to. How do you apply for a long term visa or a residency permit? What do you need to do, or have, in order to immigrate? After all, this is not like moving from one state to another in the US - this is something she has to apply for.\n\nShe will soon realize that unfortunately, the chances aren't great for someone with little formal education and few job skills to immigrate legally to many countries. (If she's monolingual, her choice of countries is also already pretty limited.) \n\nCurrently, there's also little chance of being granted asylum because of the persecution of trans folks - but again, you don't need to be the one to tell her that. Instead, suggest that she look into what it would take to make a successful claim for asylum. If she thinks immigration laws are restrictive she's going to be even more appalled at how hard it is to prove you are being persecuted enough to receive asylum. (The other reason to encourage her to do this research is because it is entirely possible things will get worse, and they may even get bad enough that other countries will begin considering trans people from the US for asylum. If that happens, she'll be ready.) \n\nFinally, if she is thinking about doing something like overstaying a tourist visa, make sure she gets solid information on what that would look like in reality. It is not easy to do. Remind her of all the situations where she's going to need a valid ID - for a job, for an apartment, etc. How is she doing to manage that? (This is where her lack of \"a village\" in the host country is going to be most significant.) \n\nBasically, the process and the facts are going to discourage your friend enough that you don't need also need to discourage her. If you're telling her it won't work, she's going to perceive your dynamic as \"you vs. her dreams\". If you pursue information together and that information is discouraging, then the dynamic will feel like \"us against the system.\"\n\n(If she's unwilling to do the research, then you know it's just talk, a way to pretend she has more options than she does - which might well help her mental health, so I'm not knocking that option. It also means you can respond to it with the understanding that none of this is realistic and she probably knows that on some level. Escapist daydreams don't have to be a bad thing.) \n\nSo I think you can support your friend in finding information on immigration, and then support her further as she finds out how difficult it is, and how unfair. (Occasional conversations about the oppressive nature of states and borders are also not wrong!) \n\nShe needs to feel supported right now, and you can give her that without giving her false hope or unreasonable optimism.",

N\n\nThis is the thing about anti-authoritarian and non-hierarchical pedagogy : initially it takes so much longer, because you can't just say \"look, trust me, I've read all the relevant material - this isn't going to work.\" It can be so frustrating watching someone make mistakes you *know* are avoidable. \n\nBut if you step back and help her develop the tools and the desire to figure this out for herself, you're not just changing her mind, you're giving her a new and more empowered way of interacting with the world. You're also helping her to develop another critical, creative, and unique perspective, and maybe she will end up finding things we've all missed before. Antifascist pedagogy is how we change the future. \n\n(Well that and punching Nazis.)\n\nSo don't think of her as primarily young and na\u00efve - even though she is!! Think of her as someone who's never been taken seriously, and who's been taught not to think deeply, and has been trained to follow. That's how most of us are socialized. You are someone who could change that for her, if you take her seriously instead of being frustrated at her na\u00efvet\u00e9.
