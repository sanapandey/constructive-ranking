The only reason I feel even remotely Italian, other than the fact that I've only started to deconstruct the modern Italian identity fairly recently, is the fact that I do identify a bit with the larger group of cultures which have been thrown in the \"Italian culture\" cauldron, especially those from the south. But in the first place I'm not Italian, I am Roman and \"Ciociaro\". And even then, I don't see Rome as \"muh beautiful country\", I don't feel patriotic about it. I love the culture and I love the people first and foremost. \n\nPatriotism as we know it is a fairly young modern concept which, to this day, is not taken into account by some populations, not only nomadic ones. I dare to say that some movements that are trying to carry on revolutionary experiences despite difficulties, like Rojava and the Zapatistas, do not follow a classic \"patriotic\" line, there are similarities but patriotism as we conceive it most of the time is something else entirely. More often than not, patriotism is just the tamer version of nationalism, the lesser evil between the two. And whatever the case, it is not a concept that goes well with anarchism. An Italian anarchist song has a few lines that go \"Our fatherland/homeland is the whole world, our law is freedom\" and this is, in my opinion, one of the core principles of anarchism, whatever label you decide to use. \n\nPatriotism may be a tool for some forms of revolution and a powerful one, I'm not denying it, but it is not the only tool nor an essential one.",

Your definition of patriotism is not accepted by the vast majority of people, including those who would agree with your principles. I can also use \"pig\" to mean \"picture\" if I want to, but if I say \"I need some nails because I want to hang some pigs on the wall\" most people would probably look at me weirded out and ask me what is wrong with me, no matter what I truly mean. Words have the meaning that people, not specific individuals, attribute them, it is a collective process.\n\nI have gripes with inclusivity because, TLDR of a really complex reasoning, it presumes the existence of \"normalcy\" first and foremost, the norm, and then there's \"un-normalcy\" which theoretically should be \"included\", and assimilated when possible, into normalcy. It is a concession that the \"majority\" concedes to the \"minority\" without truly dismantling the status quo, a compromise. It is a reformist concept, not a revolutionary one. I'm not saying that promoting the representation of marginalised communities, being also non-binary and neurodivergent myself, is bad, but I don't wanna just see more queer people \"included\" both in the capitalist society and left-wing movements without a concrete change in the system, I want to take back the spaces for myself and my siblings wherever people like it or not.",

Patriotism, much like you said, is an internal pride in one\u2019s culture, community, and ideally its compatriots without conflicting itself to other countries. Patriotism, ideally, would also own its perpetrations to communities and people while seeking to make amends and reparations to those perpetrated. Nationalism emphasizes a pride in one\u2019s government, self-interest, and/or its moral compass over that of other countries. Nationalism\u2019s belief in the superiority of its state to that of other countries develops into closing its self to the rest of the world that does not morally or politically align with it. It also projects outward into conflicts with other countries under the belief that another country\u2019s ideology is a threat, or the belief that its morally superior beliefs should be spread to align a global community under its superior moral belief. \n\nI imagine we could agree that contemporary American patriotism does not acknowledge the entirety of its compatriots, nor does it seek to make amends with or include them. I philosophically believe patriotism is not  possible considering the cultural makeup of any country. Given those circumstances I believe patriotism can easily give way to nationalism and then fascism. This disconnect of patriotism and the consideration of entire communities is exactly what leads to division and revolution where the revolutionaries no longer own patriotism. \n\nYour belief that patriotism is the back bone of revolution is extremely warranted and ideal but requires a unified conglomerate of communities against the state which we simply do not have and will not have based on differences of ideological beliefs. We\u2019re turning to a civil war over a revolution. \n\nDo I have a solution? Fuck no lol",
