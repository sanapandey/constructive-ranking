They just hope someone else does something?\n\nI mean your president outwardly admitted he rigged the election, his tech billionaire buddy is throwing up nazi salutes, and they\u2019re pretty much pulling out of and removing anything that made the US salvageable. Please calm my mind and tell me there is some sort of anarchist/leftist/proletarian resistance to these parasites, that\u2019s just not being covered in media? \n\nResistance doesn\u2019t have to be violent so hope this doesn\u2019t break rule #4, thank you",

And this could have been partly for that reason.\n\nThis was also likely an action to shake off the rust from the 2020 uprising, and work with newly established crews. It was also a wakeup call to the DHS who instead of spending the night cheering on trump, had to fight anarchists, which led to one getting pepper sprayed. There was also physical damage done to their target, ICE. This was a signal that there will be resistance to trumps second term. \n\nBut beyond all that, who fucking cares.

I mean, The largest protest in United States history was the Women's March during Trump's last inauguration. We barely remember it. \n\nWe don't advertise our actions across the world. You will see them happen, though. It's only the fourth day. Nothing much has really happened yet on the ground re:Trump. \n\nBut yeah, we are all working against his policies. They haven't affected my community yet. We will block things we don't want. We are training and preparing. For example, tons of people are training for this organization in my community right now. https://www.northbayop.org/nbrrn. Another example: people flooding Trumps \"tips\" hotline with fake tips. He set it up for National Parks workers to report DEI. Also, National Parks employees are building a coalition, nearly 3000 employees right now  to protect the national parks (85 million acres) and resist Trump. While not a people's movement, California has budgeted tens of millions of dollars to fight Trump. \n\nMost believe that Trump will lose favor over the next year when its obvious he isn't making things better for anyone, so we are building resistance and training, etc. I think it's important to be strategic. \n\nHe only has 4 years, and if we can get the fascists out then, then a lot of the damage will be reversed, especially in regards to international thingslike the Paris Accords.\n\nWhat do you think we should be doing right now?",

Yea, not every union is perfect, especially government unions like the postal and teachers unions, but to say they are worthless is ignorant of history. \n\nIf your union isn't doing what you want, then organize a new one with your fellow workers. Collectively withhold your labor, regardless of what the law says. The original union movement didn't have legal protections but they were still able to make strides that we are still to this day taking for granted.",

Do you not know what syndicalism is? There is a reason that prominent anarchist philosophers from Kropotkin to Lucy Parsons to Malatesta and more all espouse the importance of unions. \n\nYea, the modern labor movement is full of reformist bullshit, weighed down by shallow electoralism, bureaucratic proceduralism, and liberal collaborationism. That still doesn't change that we need unions, and we need to bring them back to their radical roots. That means leaving the ones you can't fix and starting new ones. \n\n\nSo quit with the defeatist bullshit. There is shit we can do, and that is bringing unionization back to its roots. We need the radical, militant unions of the past and that starts with organizing them with your fellow workers.",
