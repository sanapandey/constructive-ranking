Please hear the cries of your disabled, cripple, immune compromised ppl as well as the non-disabled ppl in your communities (online and off) who understand covid and its body-devastating consequences- and tell your community members. Show them this zine. Hold your leftist groups accountable and demand covid safety at gatherings and demonstrations (and as the zine says, refuse the accusations that such demands for justice are \"policing\" our communities.)\n\nWe must continue to keep the conversation about this going like every other struggle. Covid hits all areas of leftist struggle, there is no reason a single leftist should not be masking save for medical concerns, or real risk of losing income/housing/food or something of the like.\n\n**WE NEED YOU.**\n\nother links:\n\n[Trans people more vulnerable to long covid](https://usafacts.org/articles/who-has-long-covid-heres-the-data-by-gender/)\n\n[What is Long Covid?](https://www.thegauntlet.news/p/what-is-long-covid?r=1lesf)\n\n[Covid \"weather reports;, resources, guides](https://peoplescdc.org/)",
