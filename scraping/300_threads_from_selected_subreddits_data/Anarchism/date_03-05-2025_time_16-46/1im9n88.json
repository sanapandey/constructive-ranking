    "selftext": "I am definitively anarchist, have been for as long as I could hold a political opinion, and have been active in it. I\u2019ve slept on streets, been kicked out of public spaces by police for sleeping in the open, and put a lot of effort into homeless outreach. I\u2019m not just here to put bricks through windows- even if that is fun- but I genuinely struggle to stay engaged and hopeful when I feel like there is no way to connect now.\n\nI get Op-Sec is important- the most important- but fuck, the right wing with their weird hardline groups like Atomwaffen or Combat-18 can recruit fairly fucking easily- why can\u2019t we? Why would it hurt us to take the risk and sometimes actually organise publicly and hurt our enemies directly? \n\nThis is half a rant and half me asking as to why we seem to be so passive now. I still see the endless fucking \u201cpunch Nazi\u2019s\u201d comics and slogans and everyone talking a big game- but most people seem to be just doing nothing. I help those in need and have been those in need, and have been to protests to counter right wing stuff in the UK, and if I could find a group of people willing to help and cover certain things- I would happily burn down a house or two (I even know how to due to having a lawyer in the family). But I can\u2019t, and it pisses me off.",

Unfortunately it was ran by a liberal group that is more interested in getting a Democrat in the White House in four years than they are with the issues they organized a protest for (immigration).\u00a0\n\n\nA lot of us have tagged along with liberal groups for a long time because they were the ones doing a lot of the organizing. That's why we weren't working nearly as hard as we should have been during the Biden administration. The liberal groups slept, and we didn't know how to organize anything ourselves.\u00a0\n\n\nWe really need to learn how to do all this ourselves. Liberals have pretty much pissed away what little trust we've had in them the last four years, which hampers organizing efforts.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm not sure where to start on that, though.\u00a0",

I have a history of aggression and poor mental health for which I receive disability payments from social security. I have been problematic before in organizing. If I want to be effective, I need to listen, keep my mouth shut and a lid on my ego and stifle all the rage that demands immediate retribution for injustice no matter the fallout. I put energy into trying to advocate for the unhoused where I live right now. I was sitting in city hall with them before, but now I'm about to see a different side of them on the 13th. I don't really have what it takes right now to start anything. If I did, something very stupid would probably still happen right away. \ud83d\ude43\nRecognize your limitations, consider others, and have a rough idea of what you're comfortable doing as an organizer. I forgot a lot because of trauma, but it's kinda coming back.\n\nThere is one definitive victory I can remember from organizing in the mid '00s. My chapter of ARA organized an action wherein we countered a hate rally in TX using puppets and street theater. We were prepared with literature and had answers for the students walking through from the college in the town where the thing was taking place. Nobody arrested, not even a nazi. We sure made them cry, though. That group of NSM nazis went home and whined on a hate website, proceeding to implode fantastically in front of the whole internet. \n\nI hope to emulate the formula one day but I don't actually know if I can stand other antifascists anymore.
