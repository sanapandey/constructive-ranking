So, basically, they took a coffee house and inverted it into exactly the opposite of what people like about coffee houses. Corporate thinking at its best.",

For unionizing at a leftist magazine.\n\nStill a great article.\n\nEDIT: oops didn\u2019t realize it was the magazine itself posting this lol. Sorry Nathan you\u2019re doing a great job.
