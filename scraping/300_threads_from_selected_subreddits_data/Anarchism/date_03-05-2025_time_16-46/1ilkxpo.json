No. There are other ways that violence is enacted and when many of our \"comrades\" insist that only one axis of oppression matters they are doing the work of the enemy.",

            "body": "It's also a war on working class people\n\n\n\"The stereotypical white male worker is actually in the minority. The working class is DIVERSE. It includes everything from extreme poverty and hardship, people who must break the law just to survive, all the way up to people who have fought for decent wages and won. Just in England alone, the working class includes people from a hundred different cultures and traditions from all over the world. We aren\u2019t all walking around in flat caps, emerging through the smog of some 1970s industrial town! (Although that is nothing to look down on either) We are not a caricature or a demographic we are real people with thoughts and hopes and lives that go well beyond what class we are in. More than 50% of us are women. About 15% of us are disabled. In the UK at least 13% of us are black or people of colour. Globally speaking, there is even more diversity than that. Most working class people are not the white European man so often pictured as our representative.\"\n\n\n\"The most important thing is this: an injury to one is an injury to all. So long as one working class person is oppressed or exploited for any reason, their struggle is part and parcel of all our struggles.\"\n\n\n- from: https://theotherleft.noblogs.org/post/2023/07/09/class-and-oppression-an-injury-to-one-is-an-injury-to-all/\n\nI also don't think for example that ableism is best understood as abled people as a class oppressing disabled people. It's more complex than that, I feel the majority of ableism I experience comes from the owning/ruling class. They're the ones making it impossible to claim disability benefits, who allow work and community spaces to be inaccessible, who profit from rigging the medical system etc. Fixing this wouldn't directly cost the majority of working class people, who are also exploited, but rather it would make our whole class more difficult to exploit as a whole - it's in their material interests to *support* us, imo. Not to mention a lot of them will become disabled at some point in their lives",

That needs to be recognized or we fall into a reductionist fallacy. Like yeah, your average leftist doesn't care about the color of someone's skin, because that would be silly. However, there are people who do and those people can and will work to harm people of color using institutional power.\n\nSo leftism is about dismantling those harmful institutions, and building protections to deal with the cultural entrenchment of bigotry.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with using class warfare as a vehicle for this concept.

It being a specific focus of the right wing as an election issue, yeah, that's strategic, but it *is* also just an answer to the fact that the number of trans people globally is very rapidly growing due to growing access to information and medical treatment.\n\nThis isn't just the Republicans doing this. The liberal population of the UK for example, is pretty famously not supportive of our cause as trans people. This isn't strategy from nothing to divide, it's division as ideology. I think op is coming at this in just too literal of a sense, but us literally fighting for our lives as trans people is not 'just a distraction,' it is an essential part of the class war.

Second. Intersectionnality is a theory about how gender, race and class intersect with eachothers resulting in differences in people's oppression depending of where they are on the venn diagram. So ignoring class is not intersectionnality. Also now people use intersectionnality to describe intersection of any oppressions despite the fact that it as nothing to do with the original concept.\n\nThird. I don't subscribe to class reductionnism because it focus only on economics and tell people who are oppressed by other form of oppressions to shut up. I as almost all anarchists consider that we will not be free until everyone is free. So it's impossible to achieve anarchy by ignoring any systemic oppression and telling people oppressed by it to wait the end of capitalism. Also the person you were responding too isn't a class reductionnist. And you accusing us of being class reductionnist just show your bad faith arguing.\n\nFourth. i don't subscribe in pseudo instersectionnality because it's an essentialist liberal ideology that only focus on identity and hyerachize people's oppression based on how many oppressions you have. It invisibilize class struggle and ignore the fact that even the less privileged bourgeois will always be more privileged than the most privileged worker.\n\nFive. I don't subscribe in real intersectionnality too despite having respect for it. Because i don't consider that systemic oppressions are separate. I subscribe to consubstantiality wich basically consider that all systemic oppressions are different faces of the same system and they are all intertwined with eachothers. You can't fight against them separately.\n\nSix. Nobody on this post is making the apology of class reductionnism. They don't advocate to ignore other systemic oppression to focus only to end capitalism. You are just making bad faith accusations to people who rightfully critize OP on their essentialist liberal stance. Because no systemic oppresion have ever been institutionnalized and made by anyone than the rulling class and the upper class. All actual systemic oppressions are a direct consequence of class war. Wich btw isn't specific to capitalism. It's a more than 5 000 years old war. Saying that isn't class reductionnism. And it's not saying that people should ignore or put aside other systemic oppression until capitalism is down. It's just politicai historical facts.\n\nRacism, Patriarchy, Ageism, Ableism, Specism, Elitism, Classism etc, are all tools people in power use to keep their power, justify it and justify the exploitation of other people for their own benefit. Giving privileges to exploited people over other people is another tool and strategy of the people in power to keep it. While the starved fight each others for scraps, the masters dance. This statement isn't class reductionnism and isn't in contradiction with pseudo intersectionnality and real intersectionnality. In fact intersectionnal feminists like Angela Davis say it too.",

I explicitly said that what the person you responded to meant what you said. So that's not reducing your argument because it remained untouched. You were accusing someone to do things they didn't do and correct them by saying things they said. And you are denying that.\n\nThe irony of the projection here is amazing. In fact i first respond to you because you were exactly doing what you are accusing me of to the other person. You reduced theur argument to something it wasn't so that you could shadow box with some other take instead of trying to understand what they said.\n\n>Deeply ironic for you to come in and try and advise others of not reading.\n\nLmao. How that's ironic? You don't know what i've read. You just assume that because i disagree with you then i must be ignorant and not understanding. You can't conceptualize the possibility that it's possible to think differently than you without being ignorant. You think exactly like upper class liberals.\n\n>And then to cite Angela Davis as to why we should make all discussions of marginalisation about one single vector of oppression above all is not something a serious person would be doing.\n\nLmao. You continue with your strawman. I'm not saying or even thinking that in the slightiest. In fact i've stated and precised the exact opposite multiple times. You keep proving that you argue in bad faith.\n\nI cite Angela Davis because she is saying exactly the same thing the person you were responding to and i were saying. Wich is not class resuctionnism or any bs you accuse us of. But the fact that racism, sexism and classism are tools of the bourgeoisie and it's capitalistic system.

I do not see anarchism as a subset of anything, and as a political and organizing philosophy based on ending hierarchy and domination, there's no real anarchists that would purport to be a subset of or under anything. Anything other than free association is antithetical.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's socialists who are constantly trying to big brother/son anarchists, and we don't need to be lectured about the real definition of socialism to understand that the core tenets of anarchism. Do some anarchists also identify as socialists bc they understand the capitalist system is one of dominance, oppression, usury, and theft? Sure.\nBut that's them chosing that at times they center economics and class systems in their anarchism.\u00a0\n\n\nThat's fine for them.\u00a0\nDo I want to end capitalism? Sure, but to me it's not more important than ending racism and natalism and forced birtherism and colorism and misogyny and nonrepresentative electoral politics.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd to the socialists who see this as an opportunity to be class/economic reductionists and argue that they're all part of the same capitalist superstructure, I say \"\ud83d\udc4fthis is why we're not your subset\". Our goals are both broader and simpler (all systems of oppression need to go) and more nuanced and contextual (priority of what systems need to go first are based on the contexts and needs of th community).\u00a0\n\n\nI know socialists think they can brow beat folks with their book learning, but i don't see many socialist motivated movements making traction anywhere (other than individuals talking online and in electoral politics both competing and spoiling). There's plenty of successful movements with anarchist labor and principles underpinning them, so I\u00a0 get why claiming anarchism is in socialists best interest, but it's not in ours.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur wider communities want clean water, free movement, abortions, food, educations, health, families, to live their lives, and to explore. And socialists telling them, 'sure you'll get all that after we seize the means of production, so stop your feeding people and securing abortion access and unionizing to focus on the real problem' my response is four fold:\n\n\na. Our needs are always the first thing on the cutting room floor, pushed to the next release, less important pawns in an economic chess game so miss me with that \"later\" bullshit.\u00a0\nb. We don't trust you enough with the actual information about how we organize bc you'd try to apply it to capitalist super structures when it wasn't built for that, eff the things we have going on, and give up the game to actual fascists and police to target us.\u00a0\nc. Identifying as prole first and a gendered, racialized, indigenous, sexualized, abused human second or third or not at all, is the privilege of someone who can afford not to be aware of their race, gender, sexuality, physical ability, skin color bc you haven't been hurt by it before. Are there people who identify first as proletariat or vanguard who hold other identities? Sure but then they have the power and or privilege to mitigate the risks.\u00a0\nd. Run along and have your debates, there is real work to be done.\u00a0\n\n\nSo do I care what someone's definition of socialism might be or how mine is odd or whatever you called it?\u00a0\nNah, unless your definition includes me needing to be subject to your priorities and philosophies. Or if, like in this post, on an *anarchist* subreddit where socialists astroturfed the comments section with class/economic fetishism and literally tone and grammar policed a racialized person for daring to say culture and class are equally important, linked, synonymous.\u00a0\n\n\nThe irony is just too much, and that self defined socialists don't see that, and see that yelling about us not understanding you is the most ridiculous fucking unself aware thing ever.\u00a0",

The rulling class always started the culture wars to make the oppressed fighting eachother instead of them. It's the divide and conquer strategy.\n\nThe culture wars are not oppressed people fighting for their liberation. It's the rulling class making up social groups and promise to one of them that their life would be easyer if they ally with the rulling class against the other one.\n\nTo fight the class war and systemic oppressions is to refuse to engage in the culture war. It's to show to people that the only real enemy is the rulling class so they stop to fight the culture war with them and join those who fight against them. It's to fight against the rulling class and the bastards (social traitors) who chosed to sign the racial/patriarchal/ageist/ableist pact with the rulling class to fight the class war on their side by engaging in their culture wars.\n\nFighting against racism, sexism, ableism, ageism is fighting the class war\n\nOppressing people based on the made up social groups the rulling class made is fighting the culture war\n\nOpposing people against each others based on the made up social groups the rulling class made is fighting the culture war.\n\nWe need to fight side by side and not face to face. That doesn't mean ignoring systemic oppressions to fight together against the rulling class. It means fighting together against systemic oppressions is fighting against the rulling class.\n\nRacialized people vs white people isn't fighting against racism, anti-racists vs racists is. Women vs men isn't fighting against sexism, feminists vs misogynists is. Trans vs cis people isn't fighting against sexism, feminists vs transphobes is. Able vs disable people isn't fighting against ableism, anti-ableists vs ableists is.\n\nWhat OP is doing here by opposing people based on their race/gender/ability is fighting the rulling class war and so doing the work of the enemy",
