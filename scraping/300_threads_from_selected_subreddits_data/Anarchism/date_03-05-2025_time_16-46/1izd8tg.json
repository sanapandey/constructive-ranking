    "selftext": "Just got back from mandatory military service.\n\nSince then, I've been helping people dodge the draft, talked to a few people online and talked five friends through it. But honestly... Me, and the people who have been, we've been chewed up and spat out.\n\nHow do you take something back, after that? The military completely soured how I feel about Greece. Destroyed any sense of patriotism I might have had. I'm not satisfied with people saying, \"Well, it's over now, you can move on.\"\n\nNo way. I gave my time and autonomy for what, a cold war with Turkey? There's a lot to be said about their government but I haven't got any beef with Turkish people! So I'm taking something back. By force, if necessary. And I want to send a clear message that this won't go unchecked. This isn't over. I just don't know how.\n\nAnd by the way, I burnt the uniform. If they want to fine me for not showing up to reserve drills, be my guest",

Collateral damage caused by their tactics throughout the war is undeniable, to the point where some of their tactics are unjustifiable. It's also important to mention that they were funded and are backed by the US. \n\nIt is a fact that Kurdish people are facing oppression from different states in the middle east. I highly doubt, however, that democratic confederalism holds the capacity to deconstruct systematic oppression, as it was seen during the detention of unarmed protestors a few months ago. \n\nI see Rojava as a quasi-state, while what is needed is the total abolition of the state. The true liberation Kurdish people deserve comes from Anarchism, not democratic confederalism.",

Worse than slavery in some ways because most slaves could at least appreciate all the real goods and services their exploitation produced... whereas the Greek military service produces next to nothing, even in terms of geopolitical security.
