(Read the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1ex7boc/request_for_farsi_speakers_for_a_translation/) here.) We had a few interested folks reach out but unfortunately nothing stuck.\n\nIn short, we urgently need someone who can help with an English translation of an interview we conducted with anarchists in Iran and Afghanistan. If anyone's able to lend a hand, hit me up in the DM. All of us over at [*The Commoner*](http://thecommoner.org.uk/) would really appreciate it!",
