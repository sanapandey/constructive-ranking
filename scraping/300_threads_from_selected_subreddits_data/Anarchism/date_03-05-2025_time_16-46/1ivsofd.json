    "selftext": "Has anyone done any thinking or work on using AI created agit prop on Facebook? Essentially replicating the right wing bot strategy but with anti-capitalist messaging. I would guess it is simple enough to build a bot army to spam incredibly emotionally charged, algorithm refined propaganda videos outlining hierarchical structures within capitalism and society and the effects of these structures on the everyday person. The videos obviously work to a degree, and they don't seem to have effect on the right's level of credibility amongst the masses. Obviously, something like this shouldn't be the sole messaging effort, but I cant imagine it would be a bad thing for at least slightly shifting the minds of the underclass. Objections around energy use are unfounded, the majority of water and electricity spent is during the training of these models so it is an already sunk cost. Why leave use of these models only to the fascists? The other objection would be that things should be crafted by humans, which I would agree with for things like actual theory, or art, but for slop agitprop I think its a reasonable use. Any thoughts?\n",

I don't think that throwing AI slop at people serves that purpose or makes people more capable of independent thinking.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you and some like minded folks create agit prop, you do increase your skill and capacity for talking about politics and expressing yourself artistically.\n\nPut another way: the world I want to see is one where more people are more engaged in creating art. AI slop doesn't move us in that direction.",

If you want to make content that's supposed to make a change or radicalize people you should just make genuine content. What the left is actually lacking is easily approachable content that's still educational and well informed. I don't see how producing garbage is beneficial",

Something like calling attention to an easily digestible stat to show the ill-effects of capitalism. Im not saying we make insane reactionary style dog shit. Maybe I should have said slightly better than slop tbf. \n\nOn the subject of legitimate genuine content, do you see enough talented graphic designers, video editors, directors, actors, animators, etc. to make high quality genuine content? I agree this would be best, but we really don't have the resources to compete on that front currently in my opinion. Propaganda isn't just about having a good message, it takes effort to make things both digestible and conveyed in a way to elicit an emotional reaction that is capable of shifting someone's perspective.",

Do you think they stop and wonder if mass-producing propaganda is ethical? They flood every platform with bots, AI-generated lies, and emotionally charged garbage that drowns out real discourse. And some of you want to fight that with one hand tied behind your back?\n\nThis isn\u2019t about replacing human creativity or genuine organizing. It\u2019s about survival. It\u2019s about making sure our voices aren\u2019t lost in a sea of reactionary manipulation. AI is a tool, just like a printing press, a radio broadcast, or a protest chant. The right uses it to push their agenda, and if we refuse to adapt, we are choosing to let them win without a fight.\n\nPeople are out here treating this like a classroom debate when it\u2019s an information war. AI is already more convincing than most human debaters. It can break down complex ideas, respond instantly, and never get tired. The opposition is relentless. They have money, they have platforms, and they have no shame in using every dirty trick available. If we don\u2019t evolve, if we don\u2019t match and surpass their efforts, we will be talking to ourselves in an echo chamber while they take over every space that matters.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about moral righteousness. It\u2019s about power. It\u2019s about who controls the conversation, who shapes public perception, and who wins the future. If we don\u2019t use every weapon at our disposal, we won\u2019t have a movement left to defend.",
