            "body": "My thought? Not so bad. PKK had enough result in drawing the worldwide attention. After the ceasefire, PKK affiliated parties such as YBS/YJ\u00ca and SDF (not only Kurds but also Yazidis, Assyrians, Arab Syrians, etc.) can focus on combating Daesh fascists, while PKK, now legalized, can work on \"symbolic resistance\" like Zapatistas are doing. Demands of left-leaning parties (ex: cultural autonomy of Kurds and Yazidis, rights to return of 1915-displaced Armenians and Syriacs) can be achieved in long term, and in short term we can restore the war-torn society.\n\n\nHowever, the same process happened in 2013, and it didn't go well. I doubt Turkey & Azerbaijan and their allies (Qatar, Israel, NATO, etc.) would have enough morality and conscience left to make such a deal.",
