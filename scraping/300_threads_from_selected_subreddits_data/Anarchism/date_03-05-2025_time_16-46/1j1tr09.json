    "selftext": "The time is nearing for cataclysmic collaspe, possibly the global civ ending in nuclear armageddon and there being a mass culling.  All the evidence suggest that collapse is coming, the civilization has nothing going for it anymore, it's running out of steam and the technology has come to a complete standstill.  Regression has happen on a lot of fronts, particularly the Arts, since the middle class no longer exist.  I predict within this century collaspe occurs possibly in the next 70 years.  This is not a time  looking forward but rather the general atmosphere is one of pining for the past and nostalgia. The end is nigh. ",
