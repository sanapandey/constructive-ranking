            "body": "Not really.  It is useful in high density environments. Good for commuters in places like DC, Boston, NY, ect.  Not helpful for me to bring groceries home.  I like my suburban home at the edge of suburbia.  I would not trade it for anything less than full rural.  Running a bus to my neighborhood makes no sense.  \n\nHigh speed rail is a decent concept.  But again, I think it best in high density areas.  NE Corridor is a good use case.  But implementation is hard.  And it is not going to be self supporting.  I do not see nationwide HSR as being viable and I did not support Biden's plan for it at the beginning of his term.  I do think there are corridors where it can work.  But putting NY to LA is not worth the cost.  Maybe in 50 years or more. But not today.   \n\nNYC seems to be the best implementation but they have crime issues.  And crime does plague public transport.  I rode Denver's buses to downtown a couple times.  I stopped because I don't like stepping over crack pipes and having homeless sitting next to me.  I do think homeless is an issue, and big cities are not going to keep homeless of systems.  That will keep people from riding.  Safety and security, perceived and real, matter.",

                            "body": "Both seem like viable corridors.  I know there is a lot of traffic between LA and LV.  But can be be built competitive to airlines?  Because that it what I think the competition is.  I do not see it pulling cars off the road. To pull cars, it has to be made cost competitive. I do not see that happening.  One of the reason people drive is to have a car at the destination.  Rentals are not cheap.  So I see HSR as competing more with air than auto.  And that begs the question, should the government fund competition with private?  Airlines are private, though regulated and dependent on government support (ATC, airports).  Does it make sense to subsidize competition to airlines? I do not think so.   \n  \nHave you priced Amtrak between DC and NYC?  It can be more expensive than airfare.  In that corridor, I do think HSR can provide a superior service because it can bring people from city center to city center (DC Union Station to Pennsylvania Station). Both cities have decent non-car based transportation.  I do not think many propose corridors can say the same.   \n\nFor Dallas to Houston, that is getting pushed hard.  I would like to see it succeed.  But I am not convince it is viable.  There is a lot of business traffic between the two. The drive is just long enough to be annoying, and the fight time is just short enough to be annoying.  Which sounds weird, but I think flying gets weird when you spend more time going through TSA and waiting in the terminal than you do actually in the air.  But neither Dallas or Houston have non-car based options that are worth a dime.  Even though billions are spent on them, they are not great.    Neither also have the same density of NYC and DC.  So HSR would have to go city center to city center.  Not sure where they would put it.  The Houston Amtrak station is at the edge of downtown in a crowded area.  To get the same transportation services that an airport offers would take a lot of space, which is not there.  Need lots of parking for travelers, support of auto rental, similar to what an airport offers.  And again, its public money supporting competition against a private company.  So I do think it comes down to weather or not existing options, such as air, can support future demand.  Airports do have capacity limits.  So are larger metros, it may start to make sense to have HSR.  But I really think the best use case for HSR is in high density environments, and I don't think the US has much.  Tokyo is a very different place than DFW.",

But having it end in Rancho Cucamonga is really inconvenient. I mean on a Friday afternoon for a weekend trip trying to get too Racho in traffic is a disaster.",

All the existing rail networks are prioritized for cargo and are maxed out in capacity, not to mention they aren't built for high speed trains. So would a dedicated high speed rail line be profitable anywhere in the US? I doublt it. They would have to serve distances that are too far to drive comfortably and be cheaper than flying without being much slower than flying. \n\nPersonally I looked at amtrak tickets for my family when my child was born because I thought it might be less stressful than flying. Turns out the train would take twice as long to get their than driving and was more expensive than flying.",

No, it'll never be where I live nor would it make sense.\n>What do you like and/or dislike about it?\n\nI think that it's great as long as it makes sense. Some places have a high enough population density where it can significantly reduce traffic and enable greater accessibility.\n>What are your thoughts on high speed rail?\n\nThink it's good too. I'd love to see some system that connected city's together like it used to be with the railroads. I think that Amtrak may not be the solution, it needs to be something where the leadership at least makes an attempt to make it as revenue neutral as possible.",

Its great when I visit a city that has it working well.  The only city close to here that has reasonable opportunity for mass transit is Honolulu - which is  a 230 mile plane ride away - and their \"The Bus\" almost works, and the rail project has been an embarrasment to Hawaii.\n\nIf I visit a downtown metro area (something I try to avoid whenever possible) pubic transit works in many cases.  It works really well in Europe when I traveled there - train from city-city, country - country, undergournd and trollies around town was nice; but again much higher density to life out there than where I want to live.\n\nSo IMO public transportation is nice to visit when it works - but beyond that, really not important to me until you want to raise my taxes for it.",

Cities here are made especially dense so it makes sense.\n\nI like to say \"In Europe, things cost the same, but you get half as much.\" This includes living space, appliances, small cars and parking spaces, jobs pay half as much (but I get 40 days paid vacation and 40 hour work weeks!), etc. Many people still dry clothes here by hanging it all over their apartment instead of having a dryer. Do not even get me started on AC.\n\nI have been here for 8 years, traded in my Texas drivers license for a German Fuherschein (took 30 minutes), and have rented cars in the US when I go back.\n\nBut I have never needed a car in Europe. Ever. In 8 years. The public transportation is THAT GOOD. Hell, I will even take a long distance train over flying. The seating is spacious, WIFI included, big walk in bathrooms, and a bar and restaurant!\n\nHaving said all that, Americans value things like a BIG house, a BIG back yard, a BIG garage, multiple vehicles, rentable storage space for all our extra shit, etc. We value buying 2 weeks worth of groceries for our family and taking it home in our car (I still do the same as a single man, but have it delivered). We do not want to have to plan around public transportation.\n\nAll the Americans I know (yes this is anecdotal) cannot make it here past 2 years. We live in a very different life of convivence and having \"stuff\". My friends from Europe who visit friends in America are always amazed at the amount of things we have.\n\nIn conclusion, we as Americans are often too far spread out, and those in rural communities could never realistically use public transport. Our car centric transportation system makes absolute sense in the US.",
