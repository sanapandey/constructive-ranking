Bibi Netanyahu.\n\nBut no, let's continue to ignore that and just continue parroting the talking points of Muslims being radicals and where they live is terrible because their values are bad and isn't Israel so good for being a beacon of light there?

They might be a lost cause. \n\nBut the MAGA base is larger this time around and it\u2019s not all a monolith. You think the minorities Americans that Trump won over by a increasing margin including myself are far-right white nationalists? \n\nIt\u2019s possible to unite with the people who are independent thinking and fight for the policies we can both agree on, but you have to actually try and have a good faith discussion instead of accusing everyone to be in a cult.",

Ha, it is quite literally comparable, Israel is talking about annexing the West Bank and Gaza, which in your words be a territorial expansion for lebensraum.\n\nYeah the minorities and dissidents in this case are Palestinians. In their eyes West Bank and Gaza is already there, so they view it as an internal conflict. It\u2019s similar to China view on Taiwan.\n\nIsrael is multi-ethnic, but they believe that Jewish lives are far superior than Palestinians lives. If one Jewish hostages is saved, it\u2019s worth killing 10k Palestinians.",

Just from what I know and what I\u2019ve seen, completely outside of the human toll inflicted on both sides, supporting Israel is in our best interest.  Among other things, Israel helps us develop weapons, they give us a faithful, powerful ally in the region, and they don\u2019t persecute Christians in the region like the islamists do.  Look into what happened in Lebanon after \u201cpalestinian\u201d refugees were allowed into the country.  Almost half of the population was Christian.  They were all either forced to flee or subjected to violence from the Muslims.  If Palestine really was the Palestinian homeland I\u2019d feel different about it, but it isn\u2019t just their homeland.  They\u2019re just what we call the Arabs who lived there, while there are also non-Arab Jews, Christians, and Muslims who have also called it home for thousands of years.  Many \u201cPalestinians\u201d were Arabs who moved there to try to counter the influx of Jews 100 years ago, but have less ancestral tie to the land than the Jews there.  Unlike the Jews though, the Arabs have a long history of outright ethnic cleansing and actively trying to conquer all of their neighbors.  They invaded Europe multiple times, they\u2019ve killed or subjugated native populations from Mumbai to Cordoba.  They continue to persecute religious minorities even in the more \u201cprogressive\u201d Arab nations.  It\u2019s just a totally different beast than Israel or even Iran itself.  Hamas and Hezbollah are both basically ISIS lite.  They won\u2019t stop at a Palestinian nation.  They want to eradicate Israel and move on to Europe like the Ottoman Empire and Umayyad Caliphate before them.  Israel keeps them in check without having to involve the US or Europe directly.  But make no mistake, if Israel were to collapse tomorrow, either the US, Europe, or Russia would be the next target.",

The US flattened cities during WW2 to break their enemies and in every other war in history the populations of large cities like Gaza either fled, were massacred, or were removed.

I'm assuming you're asking in good faith and not expecting a full plan but a reddit level answer so a few things:\n\n\\- not funding/supporting Hamas in the first place like Netanyahu did\n\n\\- actually being the \"most moral\" army and not committing war crimes pretty much daily for 70+ years to radicalise Palestinians and perpetuate the cycle of hate. \n\n\\- prosecute soldiers who commit war crimes, remove them from service, and actually operate within the standards of international law\n\n\\- not run an Apartheid ethnostate. this is a bit of a no-brainier.\n\n\\- Actually prosecute settler terrorists, cease their illegal colonisation and literally move them both out of harms way back into Israel AND thereby reduce tensions. As a MAGA supporter, I'm sure you see illegal immigrants who steal land and are violent as a bad thing, and you can see how if a government is supporting them by having the army protect them literally as they commit violent crime, it would radicalise a population and build support for the more extreme groups within it.\n\n\\- not kidnap and murder children, even for minor offenses. Not shooting them for playing in the dirt being a really easy example.\n\n\\- Not deliberately using excessive force and targeting refugee camps etc. Or always opting for the option that will cause the highest loss of life/infrastructure. \n\n\\- not using torture on hostages and other torture/terror tactics against civillians (drones playing baby crying, taking hostages to use as human shields etc)\n\n\\- actually engaging in ceasefire talks and not deliberately postponing them in order to cause more death and destruction (the current \"ceasefire\" is literally the same deal as 9 months ago)\n\n\\- not engaging in collective punishment\n\n\\- not openly spouting genocidal rhetoric and actually prosecuting those members of parliament who do\n\n\\- allowing in aid, not deliberately destroying it, allowing settler terrorists to destroy it, and deliberately holding it off so long that much of the food is rotten\n\nIs that enough?\n\nFundamentally:\n\n\\- not do things that will radicalise and antagonise the oppressed Palestinian people so that they are encouraged to turn to or sympathise with Hamas, reducing recruitment capabilities and increasing the likelihood that Palestinians will fight back against them.\n\n\\- actually act in good faith and cooperate towards peace rather than lying about it and using it as a false pretense for colonisation\n\n\\- generally not also act like terrorists by committing atrocities on par with and worse - and always at greater scale - than Hamas. By actually being the \"good guys\" rather than being the \"even worse guys but with a bigger marketing budget and US support\".\n\n  \nWhich of these things do you not feel is reasonable/doable and why?\n\nOther than the obvious \"Israel doesn't actually want peace and just wants to wipe out Palestina\" answer.\n\nTo quickly address your other points:\n\n\\- We aren't opperating in WW2. Things like ICC/ICJ, Geneva Convention etc are all to prevent WW2 and WW1 levels of suffering etc. \n\n\\- Palestinians can't integrate into Israeli society because they are literally prevented due to the Apartheid there. The few you see are, as you are aware, propaganda and a facade. Of course they allow a few so they can say \"see it's not an apartheid\" and only those who are totally ignorant to the situation believe this.\n\nAre you aware of the group Breaking The Silence? Composed of former IDF soliders who share their stories and evidence of all the war crimes and such that Israel has committed? B'Tselem?",

Israel military is far superior than Palestinians military. Why are we so worried about their ability to defend themselves? Dragging the war on as long as it has is only making the conflict worst and radicalizing more innocent Palestinians to support Hamas thus continuing the cycle of violence. My contention is that it needs to be Israel who breaks that cycle.\n\nBtw there is a video tape about Bibi wanting to prop up Hamas. They wanted them to be charge as controlled opposition in order to steal land.\n\nTimestamp: 11:55 -> https://youtu.be/2PeYDphtHYo?si=06PRdD5lVVuT7MaF",

Do you recognize that women might not share your view of feeling completely \u201cat home\u201d in Saudi Arabia and others? To what extent does this matter to you?\n\nYou are completely right. Women are fine in Kuwait, Bahrain, and the UAE, and should cover their heads in Qatar, Oman, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nOther than that, in companies all regions of that area, women hold very high positions. They just have to wear a scarf over their heads. But that is only because they use slave labor from other countries such as India.\n\nBut lets worry about women wearing scarves who employ slaves.\n\n51% of labor in these countries allow corporations to recruit labor in developing countries for $20 a day knowing full well that will not house or feed them in their country. They come from countries where they make $5 a day and $20 sound like a fortune. When they arrive, their passport is taken from them, LEGALLY, and they must serve out their 3 year contract.\n\nYes, tell me more about the oppression of women.\n\nNow that you know about having a slave underclass in the gulf states, tell me more about how you feel about illegal immigration in the US. Its the EXACT SAME THING.",

You would be floored as to how the economies of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain operate. If you do not understand what modern day slavery is, visit the middle east.\n\nWhat Trump is offering is WAY better than what that region would ever offer.",

I somewhat support Ukrain in their defense - Russia attempting to forcably take terratory was somthing worthy of defending against.  The inital support to Ukrain was worthy IMO, but in this case might (Russia's) makes wrong, and challenging Russia and China here may not be winable.  The history betwewn Russia and Ukrain is also a bit merker to me - I've researched it a lot less.",
