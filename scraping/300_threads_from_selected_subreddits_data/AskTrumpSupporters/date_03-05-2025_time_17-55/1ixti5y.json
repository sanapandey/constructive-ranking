In my view, the national parks we have in the USA are our crowning jewel and their preservation is possibly our greatest achievement as a nation. In the scheme of the federal budget, the parks are basically free, and the parks are far more important than the vast majority of functions of the federal government. They actually offer tangible value to every American (anyone who doesn\u2019t go to them is fucking up). My visits to a national park are always some of the best parts of the year. On a per-dollar-spent basis, I can\u2019t imagine anything the federal government does comes close to the value of the parks. All this is to say optimizing the parks budget should be the very lowest of priorities. \n\nI\u2019m sure to some extent there is budget optimization that can be done without impacting the efficacy of the NPS, like hiring some workers seasonally. But I would hope it would be done very carefully. Preserving the parks and keeping people safe when they visit actually matters unlike so many other federal government functions.",

I also think it's probably something that should be done with more care. \n\nI don't know how national parks work so I can't really comment on their needs, but they are national parks and therefore important so I'd treat them more sensitively.",

Collins (or Murkowski) isn't enough to call something bipartisan\n\nFor more laughs, this was the 2nd sentence in a WaPo article on the matter--\n>He was the sole employee with the keys and the institutional knowledge needed to rescue visitors from locked restrooms.\n\nSole employee with the keys? Like he can't just give them to someone else.\n\n'Institutional knowledge' to unlock a bathroom door?? lmao\n\nand how are people getting locked in the bathroom so often that it's a problem? Is the guy with the keys locking the bathrooms at night without checking if anybody is in there? If so, all the more reason to fire him\n\nIf this is what the media is leading with, I'm gonna guess that there's not really a problem. Sucks for the people who get fired.

Is it a reading comprehension issue?\n\nI don\u2019t know if the rules of this sub allow me to answer that question, but I\u2019ll offer one perspective and then ask you about yours. \n\nI think that many people have the impression that government agencies are bloated and inefficient. A private business might use one guy to do a job where a government agency might use five. The private business could argue they\u2019re doing the job more quickly or cheaply; the government agency could argue they\u2019re doing it more thoroughly or safely; I\u2019m not trying to argue either side of it. I\u2019m just saying that this is the impression \u2014 the government is doing things one way, but a business would do the same job for less money because they\u2019re operating under different incentives. \n\nSo therefore, the perception would be that if you ran the government more like a business, you could do the same job for a lot less money. I think this is what people understood by cutting the federal workforce: you reduce wasted or duplicated work, cut down on inefficiency, but the job is still getting done. \n\nWith all of that out of the way, here\u2019s my question to you: how does that perception compare to your own?",

Very simple word, groceries. Like almost \u2014 you know, who uses the word? I started using the word \u2014 the groceries. When you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time, and I won an election based on that.\u00a0We\u2019re going to bring those prices way down.\"\n\nThis is not left leaning media, this is literally from his mouth.  \n\nWhen judging prices, you need to look nationally.  Since Trump took office they have increased about 18% nationally.   Glad they are down near you, but that is not what the nation is seeing.  That matters.  \n\nSo we are clear.  Trump never said he was going to fire national Park employees and close parks.  Which he did and you claim was part of his open plan.   He did however say he would fix pieces starting day one and hasn't passed a single thing to do so.  Yet you claim that it's just left wing media claiming he said that.  \n\nWhy?

Egg prices specifically now are different than everything else, though, because of unforeseen necessary culling of much of the stock meaning demand is much higher than supply.

Hell, as late as the fucking 1970s, women could be denied private bank accounts and business loans without a man to cosign. \n\nNow, your answer suggests that the movement away from those past discriminations was a good thing, since you decry \"discriminatory hiring/promotion practices based on race/gender/disability\" (we haven't actually gotten past the disability category, but that's not my focus for purposes of this question). So, I guess what I want to know is, to what point in the past would you recommend we regress (because, despite your bizarre conflating of \"regressive\" and \"progressive,\" that's what \"MAGA\" means - it's an acronym that preliminarily concludes that our past was better, and we need to go back to it; movement backwards is literally regression)?",
