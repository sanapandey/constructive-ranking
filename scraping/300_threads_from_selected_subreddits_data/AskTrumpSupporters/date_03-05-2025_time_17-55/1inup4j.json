    "selftext": "I spent my morning watching Forbes\u2019 unedited press conference footage of Elon Musk and Trump yesterday. Throughout the entire press conference, Musk and Trump make some pretty big claims of things they found but provide no evidence. They say they are seeing payments to the deceased, payouts long past contract expirations, and foreign corruption. I believe that all of this is alarming, but why not show the people any of it?\n\nI, then, decided to go into the comment section and saw a ton of people praising the press conference as transparent and open. Thanking Trump and Musk for telling it to them straight. And that only confused me more because I felt like they showed nothing. I mean, the other day Musk said that he saw 50 million in condoms sent to Gaza and in this same press conference admitted that he misspoke and that he will make mistakes.\n\nSo, it made me wonder\u2014as a TS, do you just take Musk at his word when he says he\u2019s seeing this stuff? Would you want to see evidence of said corruption? What kind of evidence would you want to see? \n\nhttps://youtu.be/RncK73kM_FM?si=H5TV38n_wWxfraDr",

It's the 2nd largest entitlement and line item for the feds therefore there is a ton of lobbying money making sure no change happens to the status quo.\n\nThat's why the best way to tackle this multi decade issue, start exposing clear corruption (thousands of 120 year olds collecting social security) and then the country can have a conversation of how to prevent this from happening again.\n\nYou know how people like to fear monger the military industrial complex, in reality it's the healthcare lobby. We spend 1.6t on medicare and medicaid but .8t on defense. So any attempts to reduce spend will enrage the largest and most politically active lobby groups in the nation (the health care industry).\n\nThere is a lot of money in maintaining the status quo so prepare for a lot of money to flood into activists to stop any reforms.

Are you so easily satisfied when it comes to millions of dollars or your personal information?",

Think this way,  Musk is Trump's subcontractor.  When you buy a product, do you research all their subcontractors? maybe you do, then you shouldn't buy if you don't like them. Like don't an iPhone because they abuse those African kids for the minerals.  Don't use reddit because it uses AWS, etc. \n\n So in this case, you shouldn't vote for Trump.

And the current president is doing it. Want to know why the Democrats are not fighting it? Because the next time they are in power, they want to be able to do things like forgive billions of dollars in student debt. Its the same reason they did not get rid of the filibuster. Because they know, likely, in 4 years they will be back in power.\n\n>Some respect for the separations of power in a democracy? If congress approved a budget and a spending, shouldn't this money being spent until congress decides otherwise?\n\nI 100% agree actually! If money is allocated by the Legislature to an Executive agency, the Executive can absolutely decide not to spend it, and that money is simply not used. This is just ridiculous thinking. \"We allocated your agency 100 billion, and by God, you better use it all!\" Which is the reason our government is so bloated and useless.\n\n>Who should be able to make such decisions?\n\nUltimately, this is a Supreme Court decision in the making. As much law is made, someone has to test the law and see how the Supreme Court rules. There is nothing illegal about that, it is simply how our legal system works.\n\nEOs that where the Biden administration tried to eliminate student loan debt was struck down. It will be interesting to see how the Supreme Court rules regarding using the fully allocated monies by the Executive, even if it is obviously wasteful. This is the rule of government (and departments in corporations!) where if you do not use your entire budget you will only be funded that much next year. This sort of mindset needs to go.\n\nI predict the current administration will win this argument.",
