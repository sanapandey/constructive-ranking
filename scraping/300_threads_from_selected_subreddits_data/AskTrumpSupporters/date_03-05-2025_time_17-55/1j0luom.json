Whatever Israel needs to do to defend itself from Iranian-backed terror proxies, like Hamas and Hezbollah, is fine by me. As to what the future looks like, I\u2019m partial to [the plan laid out by Jordan\u2019s President](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-hamas-gaza-egypt-arab-post-war-counterproposal-trump-plan/) when he visited the U.S. recently: let\u2019s meet in Saudi Arabia and work on a deal that leverages the position of regional powers, like Egypt, to find a solution. If Trump\u2019s rather colorful suggestions push those regional powers to take being at the table more seriously, then all the better. At the end of the day, this is a regional issue. The solution should largely come from its members and the responsibility should largely fall on their shoulders. Obviously, we\u2019re going to support Israel at the end of the day, but our role in talks should be to help all sides reach a consensus. \n\nNow to the Russia question. The idea that Ukraine started this war is ludicrous, no matter who says it. Russia is a tyrannical state with a long history of 21st century expansionism that threatens the sovereignty of our allies in the region. That should be unequivocally stated. At the same time, the relationship between Russia/Putin and Trump is as overplayed now as it was in 2016. I think Trump views all of this as an unnecessary distraction, rooted in Obama\u2019s failures to counter Russian expansion into Crimea in 2014 and Biden\u2019s strike restrictions that pushed this into a war of attrition that Ukraine cannot win. It isn\u2019t some offense to acknowledge that reality. Like he said yesterday, he\u2019s trying to get both sides to the table. That\u2019s a fine position, but he\u2019s in too big of a rush to make it happen. \n\nAs much as I\u2019d love Crimea + Eastern Ukraine back into Ukrainian hands, it\u2019s unlikely. I\u2019m fine with American security guarantees being given to solidly their sovereignty over the rest, so long as something like a mineral deal (or something akin to a destroyers for bases deal) is included. I\u2019m even partial to giving them NATO membership. Expanding tf out of NATO is a great way to counter future actions against Poland or the Baltics. Turkey makes this difficult, even when the U.S. was theoretically open to the idea, though.",

I definitely do not support the U.S. financially sponsoring or leading that effort. \n\nMore specifically, this will require other regional powers to get more serious about combatting Iranian influence in the region. Most of the problems in the region are fueled by Iran, and it is in their interest, especially the Abraham Accord nations, to join Israel in that effort, as the Israeli PM has said since October 7 and reiterated after the fall of Assad. Hamas, as it exists today, must be eradicated, yes. There is no peace with it at the table. \n\nBeyond that, the rest is up to them.",

                            "body": "It\u2019s limited strategic import and capability, longstanding hostility from the population, diverging geopolitical interests, and recent political spats. \n\nFirst, Canada\u2019s strategic importance vis a vis the U.S.\u2019 foreign affairs is limited. Most of our concerns are in Southeast Asia, the Middle East/North Africa, and Eastern Europe. Canada\u2019s force or diplomatic projection abilities in those regions is low, unlike the listed major allies. At the same time, and by your military\u2019s own admission, [Canada\u2019s military capability does not inspire much confidence](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.7135390) or bring much to the table. Over half of the Air Force and Navy\u2019s assets are undeployable or unserviceable due to manpower issues, shortage of parts, or limited/no ammunition. Over half of your armed forces, across the branches, are undeployable. In the words of Canada\u2019s former Ambassador to NATO, Kerry Buck, \u201c[this] means that Canada\u2019s falling further down the rank of allies. It means that the gap is growing between our international commitments and our capacity.\u201d Ambassador Buck is correct, and that is a big reason why my ranking is what it is. The fact is America cannot reliably expect Canada to play a major role in any hot conflict we may find ourselves in, at least for the foreseeable future. \n\nSecond, the Canadian population has had a negative and condescending view of America and its people for quite some time. A recent CTV [poll](https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/article/new-poll-says-27-of-canadians-view-the-united-states-as-an-enemy-country/) found that 27% of Canadians view the U.S. as an enemy, while only 30% viewed it as an Ally (the rest were neutral). As The Maple [points out](https://www.readthemaple.com/canadian-views-of-the-u-s-have-trended-negatively-for-decades/), Canadians have viewed the US increasingly negative for over thirty years; it\u2019s a much larger issue than \u201cTrump bad\u201d. As Canadian historian Jack Granatstein said, \u201cAnti-Americanism is Canada\u2019s secular religion\u201d. So my assessment is more generous than how most Canadians evaluate it. FWIW, this road has never gone both ways. Americans routinely hold Canada and its people in high regard, [often ranking the highest in the world](https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/most-americans-view-canada-favourably). \n\nThird, the U.S. and Canada find each other in friction, or straight out opposition, on key geopolitical issues. We saw a lukewarm response from Biden when Canada wanted us to put pressure on India following the Khalistan assassination debacle, and [growing appetite to side with India among our political establishment](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-us-must-stand-with-india-against-canada/) due to its strategic importance. When push comes to shove, many (including Democrats) simply do not view Canada as worth risking the alienation of our Eurasian partners. Canada, at least under its current government, [is increasingly anti-Israel](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/canada-supports-another-un-motion-critical-of-israel), and the U.S. often has to heavily cajole Canada to take a harsher stance on China. \n\nThe recent political spats worsen all of these issues, making it increasingly unlikely that America can rely on Canada to come to its aid in a time of need as a major ally would.",

The 51st state stuff might be a joke, but if it is it's not being taken as one by some people and is at the very least not the kind of thing you would say to an ally. Then there is the constant trade war and tarrif efforts. Canadians feel attacked by the Trump administration,  and I don't think these feelings are completely without merit, are they?\n\nAs for the anti americanism being Canada's religion, is hear Americans say that sometimes as an example of hatred that Canada feels for the US, and as a Canadian I can confidently say that that's not what that means. It's been something said for a long time, but the anti American idea does not refer to being against Americans. It refers to a cultural identity of being not American. It's not controversial to say America has a large cultural influence, and I don't think it's wild to say that Canada and the USA have fairly compatible cultures in many ways. When people say that Canadian cultural identity is anti American, it's not about hating Americans. It's about resisting being lumped in with American culture and defending the small differences that make Canadian culture distinct. It might be hard for an American to understand, since there really isn't a much larger cultural force that often threatens to overshadow your own. The closest example I can think of is that movies and TV often depict america as California or new York, and people in the Midwest might push against that cultural identity by saying \"no, were not like that, we do this thing\". Is that anti California? Yes... but no.",

If Canada and Mexico would ask for an alliance without very good reason it would be an act of aggression that needs to be dealt with.

Russia is and has been invading its neighbors  and will continue doing it. The only thing that has stopped them so far is NATO article 5. Russia knows that NATO will not invade Russia as it is a defensive coalition of many countries and its members would never agree on that. Russia's wet dream is to dismantle NATO so they can start expanding again. Putin has said on many occasions that he wants to rebuild Russia to its former glory. Why didn't Russia react when Finland joined NATO recently, they have a huge border with Russia?",

Why is it bad? European leaders are clearly willing and ready to pick up the slack to continue pushing back against russia. Ukraine is also on the path to joining NATO.\n\nI guess the real question in that regard is, why isn\u2019t it bad for the US to rollover against an adversary on the world stage?\n\nYou keep mentioning Obama. Is Obama involved in negotiations here? Is he siding with putin? Has he been credibly accused of benefiting from an attack on an American presidential election?\n\nAside from that, nobody is suggesting returning Ukraine to pre 2014 borders. They are suggesting restoring the border to the day before russia\u2019s invasion in 2022.\n\nWhen did it become my job to propose solutions to attacks by American adversaries on their neighboring nations?

Just think of before they invaded, we all thought they were on a first world level in terms of military strength. We now know they are weaker than anyone expected.\n\nYour other point I will disagree with. The problem with what Trump is trying to do, is that he's trying to end the war in a way that would benefit Russia and put Ukraine on their back foot.  \n\nLets say your house gets invaded, they take over one of your rooms but are still trying to push in, now someone from across the street comes over and tells you both to stop fighting, and to just let the home invaders keep the one room and they will play nice. \n\nWhy in the world would you ever give up part of your home?",

They have interests.\n\nDo not get me wrong, there are countries that have sent men and women to bleed and die for American interests, and I will not say they did so foolishly, but I don't buy into the whole \"let's hold hands and sing some sappy song\" ideal of alliances.\n\nLikewise, I don't think we have enemies, until we do.  And those enemies are potentially everyone, because let's be honest, every country is out for their best interest, and that's entirely understandable.\n\nBasically, I view the whole thing as transactional.  When it is in a country's best interest to be \"allied\" to America, they will do so, and when it is not, they will form their own alliances.  Therefore, I think it is in America's best interest to convince other countries that it is in their best interest to be \"allies\" with the US.\n\nDo not get me wrong here.  Firefighters from Mexico and Canada (that I know of--please feel free to add other countries to the list) came to fight the California wildfires, and I sincerely respect and appreciate that.  NATO countries stepped the heck up when America invoked Article 5 after 9/11 and they did their best to help deal with terror in the Middle East (whether or not we were right in that is a whole other subject, but I don't want to argue it here).\n\nI think it's best to be friendly with everyone, but not to be friends with everyone, if that makes sense.",

I just don't think it should be classified as \"waste\" to me at least waste is when you are paying too much in pursuit of a goal. This is a difference in what our goals should be. Do I think there is plenty to fix domestically? Of course! But I also don't think that <1% is going to do anything to help our problems. Personally I believe the US is able and capable of doing more than one thing at once, and I also believe there is benefit for the American people from being involved in foreign affairs. HIV/AIDS, for example costs the US $30 billion a year on domestic healthcare costs, this isn't even accounting for the economic cost of decreased productivity. US foreign aid for HIV/AIDS is 6.5 billion a year. Each year we get closer to eradicating the disease. But that needs to be a worldwide venture. Which if achieved could save the US at least 36 billion a year.",

I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy. I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed in their genuine sense. But, in my opinion, it is unnecessary and would be unwise to extend them.\" - George Washington\n\nI believe in preserving cooperation efforts between us and all of our current \"Allies\" - or otherwise known as the Liberal World Order. I believe in improving relationships and being crystal clear in our negations with our so-called \"adversaries\". I do not believe we have any enemy except any who would set themselves against us, and I believe if that were to happen, should destroy them utterly or until they make an honest attempt for peace.\n\nI believe many of our \"allies\" have taken advantage of our generosity or have been unfair trading partners. Some of our allies enjoy social programs that they feel makes them superior to us, programs I believe they would not afford had they not had the security we've provided along major global trading routes, or our efforts to stabilize regions for global access to energy resources, or our significant investments in research and development for technological or pharmaceutical innovation, our overwhelming military and antiterrorism contributions, our leadership during responses to global crises, our humanitarian missions all over the globe, or our influence on global monetary systems. \n\nI believe that US foreign policy has neglected many of its direct neighbors in the western hemisphere in favor of globalist aspirations across the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. I personally think, Canada, US, Greenland would all mutually benefit from merging our economies to a specified extent and combining our strategic assets into securing our western hemisphere and arctic borders. I believe this can be done in a similar fashion as the European Union, so long as the United States maintains its dominance and the other countries maintain their sovereignty and identity (unless they voluntarily join the US). I would extend the North American Union down to Panama so long as all the countries in between meet strategic goals that benefit their own country as well as the North American Union; including rooting out corruption and eliminating criminal and terrorist elements within their borders.\n\nWe need to create a pathway to mending America's relationship with Russia. We need to give them incentives to open their economy, abandon expansionism, to be more democratic, to ensure protection of human rights. An improved American and Russian relationship makes the entire world a better place, unquestionably. \n\nAmerica, EU, Canada, and Australia need to work together to dismantle the cancer that has been the deep state.",
