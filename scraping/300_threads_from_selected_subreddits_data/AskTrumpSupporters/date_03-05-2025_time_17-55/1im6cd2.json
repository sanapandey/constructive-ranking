    "selftext": "So i'll preface and say I am a moderate/center leaning democrat. In a vacuum I'm not against things that Trump is doing because some of them make sense. For example things that DO make sense:\n\n* Looking into Gov agencies for corruption\n* Limiting immigration\n* Getting our debt under control\n\nHowever I don't agree with how he's doing them, but that's not really the point. The big problem I see is something Trump himself brought up during his campaign which is \"Price of groceries\" etc. I mean how many times did Trump/Vance bring up grocery prices but now all of a sudden they've kinda gone quiet about it. Heck even Trump himself said \"Well it's hard to bring down groceries once they are up\" (You can literally youtube the clip of him saying this)\n\nSo to me it's pretty clear that was used to get votes, with no actual plan to fix it. A general response to this is a lot of times \"He just got in office give him a chance! He's got to weed out corruption/DEI/etc...\"\n\nHere is my problem with that though:\n\n* DEI is sort of annoying in SOME ways, I don't think DEI in itself is \"bad\". I think some corporate executions of it is like annoying and yeah some people have def. been pushed aside job wise for \"Diversity\" which sucks, but in itself I don't think is a big of a deal as Trump and Conservatives have made it. In that sense.......I don't really think it's having a large effect on the lower/middle classes problems right now. Also honestly they are probably going to be spending a lot of tax dollars on \"weeding it out\" which just IMO is not worth it (I'm willing to be proven wrong here)\n* I agree we should be looking into Gov agencies, but I don't like how Musk is doing it which is basically \"burning it to the ground and starting fresh\". There is no denying there is corruption but some of the agencies do a lot of good and use very little money (like NOAA for example has a TINY budget compared to others). I'm not saying don't look at them but I think what they are doing is dangerous (And really Musk isn't exactly qualified in the sense that he doesn't really obviously understand everything the agency is spending money on)\n* I've seen no indication of a tax code that actually helps the middle/lower class. I know it's still in progress but whether people want to admit it or not, the 2017 Trump Tax law skewed towards the rich and we added something like 8.3 trillion to the national debt which sorta goes against everything conservatives want. I haven't seen anything that actually helps average americans out.\n* A lot of conservatives have talked about declining birth rates......but i've again seen nothing coming out to actually help that outside of banning abortion. People aren't having kids because they literally can't afford them.\n\nSo I guess what i'm asking is. What ACTUAL plans are out there that is going to help the lower/middle class. Because If there is something I'd love to be informed of what it is.",

            "body": "Phenomenal question! Just to cover one item up front, the cost of food, it's too early to tell what direction the prices are going to go in the near term. Egg prices will take time to come back down regardless because of the elimination of many flocks due to bird flu culling, this has nothing to do with Trump. However, one thing that the president does have the ability to affect the prices of is fuel, I believe that fuel prices should come down relatively fast over the next three to six months, this should directly lower food prices due to reduced transportation cost.\n\nI think some things coming down the pike pretty soon to help lower/middle class are:\nNo taxes on tips\nNo taxes on overtime\nReduced regulation in many aspects of commercial activities leading to broader price reductions, some of these will happen relatively fast. Some will require infrastructure investment to bring to fruition (oil, gas)\n\nThere are some headwinds though:\nBroader inflation still seems high and with the fed not continuing to raise rates, this is highly inflationary \nTariffs, they will be passed onto us. In his first term tariff money was used to assist farmers, I think this term some will be used to help lower our tax burdens\n\nI'm sure I'm missing some things but I'm very hopeful that the overall trend will be to lower prices. I think Trump's rhetoric around prices was for his hardcore base who need a strong leader, the rest of us (and you included!) know that the reality can't match the promise.",

So if those things are cut, industrial output goes up (and the taxes that go with them), there may be a lot of opportunities for new social spending.\n\nTo answer your question though, I think if the government used a hybrid approach where large businesses paid the cost directly and the federal government covered the small businesses that it would be a rounding error in the federal budget. By that I mean they wouldn't have to increase taxes. I don't think such a hybrid approach would be supported as both sides of the aisle are largely in the pocket of the Chamber of Commerce. Knowing the group we have in congress if they ever chose to support something like this they'd fund it using the Social Security Trust Fund.

Vance, on the other hand with the \"want more babies\" comments bothers me.  Most of the abortion and birth related statements don't seem to be commig from Trump directkly, but even if they did, its a small issue compared to so much good.\n\nOther hlelp comes from gutting waste in various agencies, moving governing of education to the state level, and deregulation of various industries (from farming, to energy, to banking to real estate) defintiely helps the middle class, and certainly doesn't hurt lower middle or poor people either.

I wonder what you mean by \"the rich\". are you talking about people who have made success for themselves, or strictly billionaires?",

Or 100 people coming out of poverty? Its return on investment, and the highest change in quality of life for the most citizens will be spending it on those who need it for basic survival.",

Most people I have seen include Social Security when complaining about government spending and a lot of the problems could be fixed by raising the contribution limit. From what I can find, only 28% don't pay federal taxes when you include FICA.",

            "body": "Let's replace a single word (bold text) on the first bullet point to make clear how this reads to non-Democrats:\n\n* **Racism** is sort of annoying in SOME ways, I don't think **Racism** in itself is \"bad\". I think some corporate executions of it is like annoying and yeah some people have def. been pushed aside job wise for \"**Racism**\" which sucks, but in itself I don't think is a big of a deal as Trump and Conservatives have made it. In that sense.......I don't really think it's having a large effect on the lower/middle classes problems right now. Also honestly they are probably going to be spending a lot of tax dollars on \"weeding it out\" which just IMO is not worth it (I'm willing to be proven wrong here)\n\nOutside the Leftist bubble, DEI ***is*** racism.  In reality that's what it actually boils down to, ugly plain old bigotry.  The Left can play all the smokescreen definitional word games they like, but the truth is self-evident.  DEI = **D**idn't **E**arn **I**t.  I'm not going to try and persuade you it is racism, that's not what this sub is about.  But you should know that is the common received understanding, and why the Left cannot make any headway polishing that turd.\n\n>I've seen no indication of a tax code that actually helps the middle/lower class.\n\nReally?  Would you say most middle class taxpayers are tax net positive (receive more than they pay) or tax net negative (pay more than they receive)?  Is there a crossover point between net positive switches to net negative, and if so, what household income does that occur at (approx $ value)?\n\nIt's been my experience that those opining on the subject often don't know the answers, because the media hasn't told them the inconvenient truth.\n\n>A lot of conservatives have talked about declining birth rates......but i've again seen nothing coming out to actually help that outside of banning abortion.\n\nYou've got a point there because there is a political problem that neither party can tackle.  The answer is actually well known, but it can't be talked about publicly without political fallout, except in the negative.  Since I'm not running for office, I can spill the beans:\n\nAs everyone knows, The Left are pro reducing birthrate in a multitude of ways.  But one of their repeated talking points about the third world says (to paraphrase): 'we need to educate women to lower the birthrate'.  This begs 2 questions:\n\n1. Does birthrate increase when there's a reverse educational shift in a country and women become less educated?   Spoiler - it does in every case where it's happened.\n2. Is there any other proven effective means besides less education?  e.g. financial incentives.  Spoiler, no.  At best they bring the timeline forward for births, but don't increase the total births.  There is no demonstrable exception in the world.\n\nThis realization is one (note: but not the only) reason why Europe decided on mass 3rd world migration to increase the population.  Uneducated third world women have a lot of kids.  Unfortunately they're typically not high quality kids and leech off the welfare state and drive 'trucks of peace' into people etc.  Who could have seen that coming?  Oh yes, The Right did.\n\nSo yes there's an answer with proven results.  It's just an answer most dislike (me included) and is politically unviable outside of certain orthodox communities that notably have no birth rate problems.\n\nHowever, in a few generations, this problem will resolve itself one way or another.  Of that we can be sure.",
