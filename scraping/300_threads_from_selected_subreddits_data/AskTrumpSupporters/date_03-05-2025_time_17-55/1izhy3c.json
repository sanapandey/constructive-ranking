Like in casual conversations between peers.\n\nB) But it's surely wrong in other cases. Like when an authority issues an official statement of some kind: executive orders, papal decrees.\n\nHarping on what people say in group A is often anti-social, or rude. But people have different standards obviously.\n\nHarping on what people say in group B is a necessary and important part of democratic deliberation.\n\nSo my question is this: how do you think about all of the cases that are in between? Do you think there are any general rules to follow?",

Otherwise, they are seen actively censoring their opposition as well.\n\nBecause of this inherent bias in humans, it is much safer to protect democracy by allowing people to say whatever they want, whenever they want\u2013 even if it hurts.",

Post mean tweets, AI videos, anything to distract the left, and meanwhile make policy decisions without scrutiny.\n\nAnd the \"left\" falls for it Every. Single. Time. Look around Reddit. 99% is \"Trump or some conservative said this. What do you think?\"\n\nMeanwhile: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/02/remarks-by-president-trump-before-cabinet-meeting/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/02/remarks-by-president-trump-before-cabinet-meeting/)\n\nFor example, with Ukraine, there are really only a few options:\n\n1. We send American forces to retake all of Ukraine. Europeans will send token forces to say \"they participated\". Meanwhile, all of our American families who have send people to WW1, WW2, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War, etc. have family members who come back in body bags, missing limbs, or PTSD. Nobody comes home unscathed.\n2. We negotiate a deal where the new borders are somewhere along the front lines. Bonus if we can make trade deals that ensures Ukraines security. But the idea of punishing Russia when they hold all the cards (nearly unlimited men to fight compared to Ukraine), or insulting them is not how you make a deal.\n3. We say fuck it, let Ukraine fight to the last man. They will not win this way, at all, and they know it.\n\nBut see, nobody really wants to think this through. So distraction on a level of mean tweets, memes, AI videos, etc. keeps you all distracted. That is all you want to talk about. Real policy requires thinking and is difficult, and sometimes there is no solution that everyone would think is great.\n\nPlease, leftists, we need real engagement on policy decisions.

I do not think there is enough support for that in the US. I personally am biased since I have 2 nephews in the military and I would not want them sent there.\n\nI have been living in Europe for over 7 years. There is absolutely no will here to fight on Ukraines behalf. Europeans talk a big game, but I know absolutely no one that would be willing to send their children to fight for Ukraine.\n\n>Why do you think that it's strategically sound to take a soft approach with Putin, when Trump's typically negotiating strategy (as described in the Art of the Deal, if I recall) is to take a hard initial position then compromise from there?\n\nBecause we spent all our \"human war capital\" fighting in Iraq and Afgahnistan. The US is war weary. Now, if we had not had of those wars since Vietnam, perhaps the public would be more willing.\n\nAnd Europe is in no condition, nor do they have the will or armaments to do anything except peacekeeping after a deal is struck.
