Excerpt below:\n\n\u201cThe site published data about the National Reconnaissance Office, the federal intelligence agency that builds and launches U.S. surveillance satellites, HuffPost reported. The NRO\u2019s budget and headcount are classified but continue to be accessible on the site as of this article\u2019s publication.\n\n\u201cDOGE just posted secret NOFURN [not releasable to foreign nationals] info on their website about [intelligence community] headcount, so currently people are scrambling to check if their info has been accessed,\u201d an unnamed Defense Intelligence Agency official told HuffPost.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.yahoo.com/news/doge-website-posts-classified-information-215218305.html",

This, if anything provides details on what other countries should expect to pay out when contracting Elon Musk, or DOGE at this point.
