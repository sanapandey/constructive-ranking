How does that allow for impartial advocacy and decision making?\n\nI find their statement to be completely ridiculous. There were certainly better ways to go about this than to use their platform to spread misinformation. \"It may appeal to a few\" - how is that so, when Trump had nearly 80 million people vote for him? I hope the White House can respond to this on behalf of many conservative attorneys and judges who are feeling blackmailed by this unnecessary statement.",

I agree that you shouldn\u2019t be able to fire somebody just because they were assigned to investigate you or your allies.  That\u2019s an outrageous overreach of presidential power.  It sets a precedent that DOJ officials should just flat out refuse to investigate politicians on either side because it will put their careers at risk if the opposing party comes to power.  It hurts all of us.  Whether it\u2019s as simple as dropping charges on a congressman for drunk driving or an outright act of treason, the DOJ should have the freedom to investigate and prosecute in a fair, ethical, and legal manner.  Now if wrong doing can be proven, then not only should those DOJ officials be fired, they should be charged and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  But political witch hunts have no place in modern American society.  As for DEI programs, they should be terminated in accordance with whatever the terms of their employment were.  If they\u2019re due a severance package they should receive it.  \n\nAs for the role of the judicial branch, it exists to make sure that a party with a simple majority can\u2019t over exert its power.  They need a free hand to do that without threat of repercussions.",

The tone of the statement sounds like they are attempting to discredit attorneys who simply are in support of dismantling USAID, DEI, etc. It also read to me as essentially blackmailing attorneys and judges into agreeing with them by stating their legal conclusion to issues that aren\u2019t objective. And many liberal attorneys see this statement as further support for disrespecting their fellow colleagues on the basis of political affiliation. \n\nAnother problem to me is the lack of transparency from ABA. Their top source of federal aid comes from USAID, raking in $22M of their $43M federal aid from USAID. They additionally filed a lawsuit yesterday against the Trump administration about his attempts to dismantle USAID. Their \u201cconcerns\u201d about immigration, DEI, and the \u201crule of law\u201d seem more like fluff to garner support from liberal attorneys, when really I feel they just included all of it to cover up the fact that what they\u2019re actually mad about is someone\u2019s pay check is getting cut.",

Basically the Department of Education overseas them as an accreditation agency and NACIQI (National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity) advices the head of the DOE to give them the authority to operate as such.\n\nThis means that the ABA basically controls what schools can produce lawyers in the USA, and by extension can then control the entire legal profession. \n\nHere's another fun part. Through the DOE they control which schools receive billions upon billions in federal student loans, that we as tax payers front the bill for. \n\nThey set the standards which influence and inflate tuition, they decide how many schools are in circulation, who gets money and where, and who gets to be a lawyer.\n\nThat's a lot of power for a bureaucracy that answers to no one and can make blatantly political statements like this.\n\nI would probably guess they don't like the idea of the DOE and their monopoly being interrupted. In any case, maybe this could be yet another great argument for removing the DOE and rethinking the accreditation process.",
