Embarrassing!\n\nImmigration rhetoric keeps amping up wrt pathways to citizenship (H1Bs, newly announced \u201cGold Cards\u201d)\n\nSome eerier and more deeply concerning things:\n\nThe alliance with sectors of Silicon Valley that are (or that work with) defense contractors benefitting massively from hawkish attitudes (see the significant associations with Peter Thiel)\n\nThe onboarding of Musk who has over-exaggerated or outright lied about the cuts of wasteful spending, or mischaracterized what that spending was for (cutting NPS funds? Seriously?), while he simultaneously develops policies that shield his companies \n\nThe weird and deceitful aspects like the complete failure to deliver on the Epstein files (because of course Congress and/or their PACs and donors would be implicated). This is a big one. If Trump wanted to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d these files are his golden ticket. We could genuinely begin a new episode of American history *tomorrow* if those names were made public. But he won\u2019t, and I didn\u2019t expect that he would. \n\nAnd of course the deepening of our pledge to Israel.\n\nMost of the policies so far just seem like rabble rousing and not truly substantial. We\u2019re really not dealing with the Rs version of FDR here despite the image both sides are trying to push. Just another DC pushover, however cantankerous and frustrating.",

If you no longer trust the USA it's probably because you have been indoctrinated by liberal media. \n\nWhat I find incredibly sad that an Aussie needs faith in the USA. That's speaks volumes for Australia.  \n\nNo it doesn't concern me that other counties might form an alliance excluding the USA. I would actually welcome that. Aussie's are misguided if they believe the USA wouldn't assist Australia. We have give Ukraine $66B in military aid. What makes you believe we would turn our back? Regarding the Trump, Zellinskyy meeting. The USA has no skin the that war other than humanitarian. We can't support them eternally. \n\nWhat invasion? Are we being invaded or are we invading another country? Regardless, frankly, if we were invaded we don't need the rest of the world. A great percentage of Europe and other countries have scaled back defensive spending. We're more than capable of defending ourselves. Russia's military has exposed itself as inept. Plus, they're in no military position to invade us. Militarily they have been decimated. \n\nThe more important question is if Australia was invaded your country would be incapable of defending your country. Australia spends $37B on defense spending. We spend more than 25x that amount. \n\nBritain $75B. France. France $61B. Germany $67B. Is their defense spending budgets. \n\nThe answer to your last question. No, it wouldn't bother me that we're on our own. We wouldn't need the help of Australia or Europe. Their military capabilities are a fraction of America's.",

So Mike Lee is pretty much saying what I was saying, and even pointing out how dangerous it is to even bring it up because everyone is will take it as a blanket screwing of beneficiaries. What he\u2019s saying is it is redistribution and an entitlement which it absolutely is, albeit maybe not the worst version of it. If it were just a forced retirement account for individuals and not paid and shared from others, that would be different. He\u2019s saying it would have to continue towards current beneficiaries and be fair to others that have paid into it already as well, so yeah it\u2019s not JUST end social security without any other details a but he does indeed call for ending it.\n\nPersonally, I know I would be able to do a lot more for my retirement if I didn\u2019t have to contribute to social security so I would be in favor of not having it but we live in a society that it\u2019s so engrained at this point that I\u2019m not sure of any ways to realistically do it well. As he says, there would absolutely be growing pains.\n\nAs a conservative myself, I\u2019m of the mindset that I want the government not to be involved in anything it absolutely shouldn\u2019t have to be. If social security didn\u2019t exist I would be 100% against creating it. As it stands, it exists and I\u2019m hopeful it can sustain but because it\u2019s the government we\u2019re talking about, my faith in it is very low but it\u2019s far from a top issue for me or for a majority of republicans.",

Which is something I strongly agreed with (though tbc if his approaches - like that with Ukraine - will actually achieve this goal).\n\nThe tax payer spent $2-3 trillion in Iraq. It feels like if that had been spent on American healthcare, infrastructure, energy or indeed anything else that would have helped the economy double. As it was boosting American jobs, and was creating something tangible citizens could use, not just a bomb that's whole purpose is to destroy itself. That's my take anyway.",
