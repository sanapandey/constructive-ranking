I am a center-right wing populist. There are two political spectrum. The right and left. Populist and establishment. Right and left is cultural issue. Populist and establishment is on economic and systemic issues that rig the system in favor of the wealthy. This system is facilitated by the swamp which are the big donors and special interest.",

I'm personally economically center-left and I voted for Trump solely because of immigration. It's always nice to come across other people who have shown that they can compartmentalize and prioritize their beliefs instead of aligning themselves with the platform of just one of the two parties.\n\nThat said, I am a bit confused by this person calling themselves center-left but saying that healthcare, education, and worker's rights should not be a priority of the federal government. Isn't a centralized, expansive, and powerful bureaucracy a core part of leftist ideology? Isn't welfare considered to be one of the most highly prioritized issues by Democrats today? \n\nAgain, I'm actually all for decentralization in certain areas\u2013 I didn't mind Trump wanting to get rid of the DOE, for example\u2013 but I just found it interesting that they also diverged from the historical/standard liberal ideology on this issue, and I would like to know more about that as well.",

            "body": "Probably anarcho-libertarians who believe in a full-fledged 'no government, no rules, no laws, no state' situation and no, definitely not among them- they're... a lot. That's \"maximalist individual rights & liberties\" which I think goes all the way right on the left/right spectrum from an economics and power perspective. I guess Nazis and the Klan sit in here too *sorta*, but given there's like 10 of them I don't really think that matters to the discussion at the 30,000ft level; and given their whole thing is utilizing the state to oppress people they don't *really* jive with the left/right axis.\n\nIf we ignore size and scope of government and freedom though, then we're talking 'neocon' vs 'neoliberal' and the far right is 'maximum neoconservative', so probably the evangelical right taken to the extreme: utilizing federal power to achieve their social missions. No gay marriage, no abortion, no equal protection clause applications, repeal the Civil Rights Act of 1964, no Harry Potter books in your school library or you don't get federal dollars, etc. They have a lot in common with the far-left though obviously (more on this later). I clearly also don't consider myself among them either; but I used to since they were the closest to my fiscal viewpoint and I just accepted that you've gotta take the whole bundle of sticks- I knew the pendulum was moving left on social issues whether they liked it or not, so I was fine with knowing the social right was going to peter out.\n\n> where they might place other groups so far as Right, Moderate, Left, Far Left, or whatever other classification you might have.\n\nEh, the left/right spectrum doesn't do us a ton of good if you ask me.\n\nYour modern democrat party apparatus is a left to far left organization (it spans the gamut from folks like Manchin to \"abolish private property and shoot CEOs\", so it's a big tent): they believe strongly in using federal (and state/local government) power to achieve their social and economic goals (eg. authoritarianism and strong centrally planned government), they're big fans of growing federal power to ensure it touches as many aspects of individual life as possible, and detractors/alternate viewpoints should be silenced or quieted to prevent spread of their dangerous/harmful/hurtful ideas.\n\nThe problem here is that the modern (or at least pre-2020 Trump) republican party has/had the same problem, it's a right to far-right organization (spanning the gamut from \"90s democrat\" to \"abolish the government, don't tread on me, come and take it from my cold dead hands\"): they believe(d) strongly in using federal (and state/local) power to achieve their social goals (eg. evangelical conservatism), they're big fans of shrinking federal power but growing it in specific sectors to ensure you can avoid most facets of individual life but grow the federal system where it doesn't necessarily interact with people directly (eg. MIC/big business), and they believe detractors/alternate viewpoints should be silenced or quieted to prevent the spread of the devil (eg. dangerous/hurtful ideas).\n\nIt's why the populist movement (eg. Trump) is such a boon; because it seems to sit smack-dab in the middle of the political spectrum where *most* Americans actually are- because the furthest left and right of the spectrum are outliers in their parties. The majority of folks grab a little bit from the party closest to them and hold onto that as their reason for being a \"registered X\", but truth is most Americans [broadly agree on big picture issues and resolution paths for them](https://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HHP_Feb2025_vFinal.pdf) which really explains Trump's appeal.\n\nPut another way, a pro-choice, pro-LGB, anti-war, not *anti-*gun fiscal moderate, social moderate who is a big fan of creeping power but loves slashing expenses (in some places) who reminds you of a blue dog democrat in the 2000s is kinda where most people are. *Significant* progress on the left side of the social scale since the 80s/90s, but measured and reasonable smack-dab somewhere in the middle of the spectrum.\n\nIt's why the neocon right got mad at Trump in 2016, it's why they stayed mad until they gave in and realized the country was moving with him, and it's why the liberal and far-left got mad at Trump and stayed mad.",

They're stopping objectionable and inappropriate material from being placed in school libraries and/or educational material. Parents are more than welcome to go buy [\"Lawn Boy\" by Johnathan Evison](https://proteacher.net/discussions/threads/lawn-boy-by-jonathan-evison-graphic-content.656913/) and let their elementary school child read it. But public schools are government facilities, and the government\u2013led by its elected representatives\u2013is free to place reasonable restrictions preventing erotic or inappropriate materials from being provided to children on the taxpayer dime. There are all sorts of material that School libraries do not have and that curriculum doesn't cover. An item being excluded from a finite selection in a public institution designed for the education of children isn't a \"ban\". I do oppose challenges to non-school libraries  offering suggestive or elicit materials, however. I definitely oppose challenges to the private publication or sale of books, though I haven't seen any attempts on this front in America. \n\nJust so I am clear on how you conceive of restrictions and attacks, can you provide an example or two? \n\nI did have an issue with the vague and seemingly-broad reach of the original bill, yes. Students and teachers should absolutely feel comfortable to open up to each other towards building interpersonal relationships before and after the bell, in after-school activities, or in other non-instruction interactions. At the same time, schools and teachers do not have much reason to be discussing such topics in formal education, especially to the ages initially covered (K-3). I know the application is now K-12, but state standards allow \"age-appropriate\" formal instruction; I would need to dig into the standards to determine my view on that. I am fairly comfortable with the amended language [reached through a settlement ](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/what-floridas-dont-say-gay-settlement-changes-and-what-restrictions-remain)that clarified the personal/formal-instruction distinction, and finds a happy medium that allows individual expression while keeping subjective and personal views out of formal instruction.",

And honestly, the GOP has moved so far left that they have become even more liberal than the Democrats were in the 2000s. So I can also tell you now that most people in this thread are going to say no, they are not far-right (and they'd be correct), and that the far-right is really [insert nasty insults].\n\nThe reason I said this was a complex question is because it is hard to define what makes someone far-right because there is not really a far-right platform to refer to. Theoretically, the far right should describe anyone who is significantly further to the right than the GOP, which is supposed to represent the center-right. Or, perhaps, it is simply someone whose ideology is significantly further to the right than the average person.\n\nI can answer with certainty that I consider myself to be politically extreme because my ideas are unpopular with the vast majority of Americans, because there is not a politician in office who I feel even nearly represents my beliefs, and because some parts of my beliefs are incompatible with the current structure of our government to begin with, and would therefore require radical change in order to implement. Thus, my beliefs would be considered part of a relatively \"radical\" ideology from where we currently stand as a society (though perhaps I would be considered a centrist in the 17th century, lol)\n\nAccording to horseshoe theory, which I actually do believe in, the extreme left and the extreme right are much less different from each other than they are from the centrists and, often, can even be indistinguishable from each other in their ideas. That said, I consider myself to be, specifically, on the extreme right (far-right) because I believe in blood and soil nationalism, and because I believe in legislating against certain social freedoms\u2013 and those ideas are currently perceived as being far-right...despite every practicing far-left government having established the same exact policies. \n\nReally, I think such ideas are simply characteristic of extreme authoritarianism. I'd argue that there is no such thing as a socially liberal authoritarian government, whether LW or RW. But I digress.\n\nThe political spectrum is flawed, but if I must describe my views in the least nuanced way possible, then I am economically center-left and socially far-right. And, yes, I still voted for Trump, whose platform is economically center-right and socially center-left (almost the opposite of me, in many ways), because I was a single-issue voter...lol.\n\nI also think I align with the far-right, despite holding center-left opinions on the economy, because I do care so much more about social issues than I do about the economy, and because I honestly wouldn't truly support any kind of leftist economy until we can sort out our border and immigration problems.\n\nBut I hope I answered your question and explained my thoughts well enough! Have a great evening :)",

                                    "body": "I appreciate the honesty in laying out your perspective, but I\u2019d like to understand how you justify these positions in a broader historical and practical context.\n\nYou mentioned supporting bans on interracial marriage, yet you also claim this isn\u2019t a racist position. Given that such laws were historically designed to enforce racial segregation and hierarchy, how do you defend the idea that government should have a say in personal relationships without it being a form of social engineering? If people are freely choosing to marry across racial lines, why should the state intervene? Wouldn\u2019t that contradict the principle of individual liberty?\n\nRegarding sodomy laws, you admit that enforcement is nearly impossible, so what is the purpose of legislating something that can\u2019t realistically be enforced? Is the goal simply to send a political message, and if so, doesn\u2019t that turn the law into a symbolic tool rather than an effective mechanism for governing? If the government is given power to regulate private relationships, where does that authority stop?\n\nOn immigration, you argue that certain cultures cannot assimilate and that restrictions should be placed on groups that don\u2019t share common values. But haven\u2019t we seen these same arguments made throughout U.S. history - against the Irish, Italians, Jews, and Asians - only for those groups to integrate successfully over time? If assimilation depends more on opportunities and integration policies than on racial or cultural background, why assume that modern immigrants are fundamentally different? Wouldn\u2019t restricting immigration based on broad cultural assumptions be more about exclusion than practical governance?\n\nYour position on women\u2019s voting rights also raises some important contradictions. You argue that women are too influenced by social trends to make rational political decisions, but isn\u2019t that an argument that could be applied to large segments of the male population as well? If social pressure and propaganda are the issue, why not advocate for a political literacy test for all voters, rather than singling out women? If testosterone alone determined rational decision-making, why have male-led societies still produced dictators, corruption, and populist movements? Wouldn\u2019t a fairer system be one that evaluates individuals based on knowledge and civic engagement rather than gender?\n\nMore broadly, you argue that extreme positions challenge the status quo, but don\u2019t you think there\u2019s a difference between rethinking societal norms and simply reviving ideas that history has already shown to be deeply flawed? If banning interracial marriage, excluding immigrants based on ethnicity, restricting personal freedoms, and limiting voting rights were truly effective policies, wouldn\u2019t they have led to long-term stability and prosperity rather than social unrest and economic decline? If these policies didn\u2019t work in the past, why do you believe they would work now?",
