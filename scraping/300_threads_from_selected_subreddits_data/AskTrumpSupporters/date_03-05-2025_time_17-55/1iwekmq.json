    "selftext": "Since the election, we\u2019ve had a large increase in the number of posts that are submitted daily. Each post is manually reviewed prior to going live or being rejected. You can view a more in depth submissions style guide at the link provided but we just wanted to pin a refresher post for any new comers (or old hands who have forgotten). A couple quick points that will dramatically improve your post\u2019s chances of being approved:\n\n1. Include sources in your post body to relevant information, preferably as hyper links in appropriate places. Link to sources with as neutral a tone as possible, factual context is what we\u2019re looking for here. BLS >> Mother Jones etc\n\n2. Providing lots of context in the question body is encouraged. Providing lots of opinionated rhetoric that you think is context is discouraged. If you are not sure of your ability to distinguish between those two things, it\u2019s best to keep your question short and sweet. A short and pointed question with even a single citation for additional context will always do much better than a long question that reads like an activist speech. \n\nWe tend to approve about 5-8 topics per day in order to keep conversations directed. There is room for variation there but that\u2019s the typical range. If you see that your post was rejected please review it and compare it to the posting guide to see where it may be deficient and try to improve it before trying again. It may be true that it was just a busy day and a total resubmission might work on another day. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read and participate. ",
