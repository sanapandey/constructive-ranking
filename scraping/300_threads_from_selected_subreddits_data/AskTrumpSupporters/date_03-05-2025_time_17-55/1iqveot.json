One is the r/Afrikaans sub and the other is r/SouthAfrica - Afrikaners are SA people who were raised speaking Afrikaans and not English. Afrikaners are never black. Some are Boer, or farmers who had land through apartheid, but not all of them are Boer. It\u2019s actually incredibly controversial in South Africa that some white farmers are targeted and asked to leave farms because they treat farm hands very well and often provide education for their family and housing. But statistically, in rural SA, among black and white both, there is significantly lower murder rate in comparison to urban areas where black saffas are disproportionately killed much more due to crime, poverty and lack of education - 3x as much.\n\nAfrikaners\u2019 lives would not be better here if they came as refugees though. SA education is subpar to American education and so they would not be able to compete at a job that would allow them to survive (I interviewed and hired South African citizens while abroad, had SA business partners, they just don\u2019t have the same level of education and so I would need to train them - of course they\u2019re just as intelligent as anyone else though). The Afrikaner response in their sub is that why would they leave their property to work someone else\u2019s lands and struggle to live? It\u2019s a very small, small amount of people who desire to come to the US on these terms. But by all means, go ask the Afrikaners their opinions yourself. You can find out from the source rather than from secondhand opinions.\n\nI also dated a Boer once. They\u2019re super manly and put American men to shame. Just tbh.",

Take Orania for example. If that became fully independent, you'd be okay with that? (Because you wouldn't have to kick any black people out; you'd just have to leave the people there alone). Asking that as a hypothetical as I am not saying millions of people could live there.",

Crime in South Africa is a widespread issue that affects all racial groups, and while farm attacks are brutal, they aren\u2019t exclusive to white farmers. The land reform debate is about addressing apartheid-era land ownership imbalances, not about targeting people based on race. Typically, asylum is granted to those fleeing state-sponsored oppression, not social tensions or general crime.\n\nNow, you\u2019re saying you\u2019re afraid that white people in the U.S. will be treated the way white South Africans are\u2014where they still own a disproportionate share of the country\u2019s wealth, control most major industries, and have full political rights? South Africa has racial tensions and economic disparities, but white South Africans aren\u2019t being systemically oppressed or stripped of their rights.\n\nIf white South Africans qualify for asylum due to discrimination, wouldn\u2019t the same logic apply to Black South Africans who still face economic and social hardships due to apartheid\u2019s legacy? And if that\u2019s what you\u2019re afraid of, are you actually worried about discrimination, or are you just scared of losing the unearned advantages that came from historical inequality?",

That framework would allow Bulgarian or Serbs to seek asylum just because they are negatively impacted by the historical ramifications of living under the brutality of Ottoman occupation. That seems unreasonable to me. \n\n\n\n> And if that\u2019s what you\u2019re afraid of, are you actually worried about discrimination, or are you just scared of losing the unearned advantages that came from historical inequality?\n\nI am afraid of political opportunists who want to use White people as scapegoats in order to enrich themselves. The political elite in South Africa uses racially charged rhetoric to justify their extreme corruption. South African politicians aren\u2019t passing laws that take land from Afrikaners to fight against injustice. They want to take land so they can give it to politically well-connected friends in exchange for favors. I assure you the land taken from Afrikaners will yield no tangible benefit to 99.9% of South Africans. Framing the expropriation of Afrikaner land as anything besides corrupt politicians picking on a small minority group to enrich themselves ignores the issue at play here.",
