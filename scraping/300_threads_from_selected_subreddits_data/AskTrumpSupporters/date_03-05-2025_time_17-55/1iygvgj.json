Some cringe and superficial \u201cle epic memes to trigger the libs\u201d rhetoric but fundamentally not right-wing.\n\n2016 Trump was electric xenophobia. 2024 Trump is \u201cGold Cards\u201d and H-1B streamlining. A big reason for the change is the reorientation of some Silicon Valley types to the Trump circle, Elon chief among them. They don\u2019t really care about America in the real, complete sense. They see it as an abstract liberal zone where anyone can come work and make the line go up (this happens to enrich them tremendously). They seem to genuinely believe in America as an \u201cideeeaa mannn,\u201d and not what it really is, a discrete group of actual people who do concrete things as part of an inherited culture and custom just like any other country. \n\nSo, to answer your question, Elon should stick to exploring fanciful tech ideas, not acting as Trump\u2019s vizier and cutting the *National Parks Service*",

There's a very important difference the left likes to gloss over because they want to portray a specific narrative and ignore any and all context wherein it's inconvenient.  Trying to muddy the waters is not fighting against injustice.\n\nAs for the Haitian immigrant thing, you'd have to point out to me where he said he wanted to deport LEGAL immigrants.  Last I checked, the Biden administration had been literally letting in a bunch of illegal immigrants unvetted for years by that point, and if I recall, that was around the time they were forced to admit that they may have accidentally let people with ties to anti-American groups into the country.",

But it was always meant to be a Muslim ban. \n\nAs for the Haitian migrants, Springfield was experiencing a worker shortage and Haitians were granted temporary protected status to work there and fill empty positions to improve the local economy. Trump then [vowed](https://youtube.com/shorts/whF2H7s1WE0?si=7pHhHlo_D73yxHkG) to remove this temporary protected status based on a complete xenophobic lie that, again, painted the *legal* migrants as pet-eating savages. A lie that Trump himself parroted and never clarified, corrected, or apologized for. \n\nDo you think any of this is xenophobic?",

If I were to go make a purchase and supply them with your membership number but still gave my name, that system would now have two records with the same unique ID. One under my name and one under yours. Now, I would never be able to claim the benefits as validation is done at that time, but I could still contribute. Does that help clarify my position?",

VIN number are HEAVILY regulated at the Federal level.  VIN numbers are include in trade agreements, export controls, law enforcement.  Even the glowing ink on the vin number sticker stuck to the bottom of your hood is inspected with a black light.  If there is an indication it's been moved or altered, the car cannot be sold.       \n\n>What if we think about it this way... say you have a unique membership number at starbucks or something and every 10 purchases you get something free.\n\nStarbucks isn't spending my money.    \n\n10 years ago:\n\nIn 2015, the\u00a0[Social Security Administration](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/fox-news-social-security)\u00a0(SSA) and its inspector general looked into the number of people in the system with no death record who were listed as being over the age of 112. **SSA found 6.5 million numberholders aged 112 or older with no death information in the system,** but noted that other **records suggested** the majority of them were deceased.\u00a0      \n\nSocial security is a 1.5 trillion dollar agency.  21% of the federal budget and they have \"no good data\", running ancient software, with no data control.    \n\nThey are not following any accepted accounting practices placed on the rest of the world.   \n\nIf you had a small business making $10,000, you would be shut down for what they are doing.     \n\ntell your auditor you don't know who you are sending the money to, if they exists, why you are sending it, payments are based off age, but you don't know what they are, and there's no process in place to make sure you're not sending out money you're not supposed to.     \n\nYou're only justification for this disgusting mess is that you don't like who pointed it out.   \n\n\"Do you have any evidence\".. It's a bullshit question.  You can't have evidence, because you don't have ANY good data, none.  This is not a database, it's a flat file spreadsheet that random shit has been added to for damn near a century.",
