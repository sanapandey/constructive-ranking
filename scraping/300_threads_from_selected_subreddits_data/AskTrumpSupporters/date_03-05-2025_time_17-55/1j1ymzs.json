The administration lies about something. Some mid level staffer knows that they are lying and wants to expose the lie, but is afraid of losing their job so they don't want to go public. They contact a journalist in order to get the story out.\n\nSo far we're talking about a factual situation wherein a journalist has a legitimate source claiming something truthful, just so we're all clear that's *not* what Trump is talking about in his [Tweet](https://meidasnews.com/news/book-ban-trump-floats-law-to-target-books-critical-of-him). So already this journalist and his/her source are in the clear because we're assuming this hypothetical journalist and source are *not* peddling in lies. Here's what I think should happen in that instance:\n\n> Is the journalist going to publish the truth knowing that the only way to prove it is to expose their source? \n\nYes, because that's not the only way even presently. Under *Sullivan* Trump should file suit for defamation claiming actual malice which then has to be proven- Trump first needs to prove the claim isn't true, then Trump needs to prove that the journalist knew the source's information was false (or didn't bother to try to check if it was true; eg. reckless disregard for the truth). Revealing the source isn't necessary, and there's no mechanism to compel the journalist to do so here unless they want to and agree to do so with the plaintiff in order to avoid the messiness of discovery and a trial.\n\nIf this \"new case law\" Trump wants to generate somehow forces reveal of the source, then the same pathway applies: Trump's legal team needs to prove the claim is false, then prove that the journalist knew it was false or expressed a reckless disregard for the truth. The easy way to make that impossible to prove is, as a journalist and a media outlet, to ensure your reporting is nonpartisan- 'we thought it was true and because we report equally on the left/right there's no reason to suspect we'd have a disregard for the truth.'\n\nIf Trump's legal team can prove both prongs the journalist themselves should be liable if they refuse to reveal the source- since the original 'whistleblower' is who a plaintiff wants to be responsible for the claim, anyway.\n\nBut there's no way to compel speech. This is still the journalist's choice: you can be on the hook for whatever the big defamation judgment is or you can settle with the plaintiff for reveal of your source since that's probably who the plaintiff really wants to sue, anyway. If you're a big media organization you settle for a big figure. If you're an independent journalist you give up the source to prevent being financially ruined by reprinting their lies with your reckless disregard for truth.\n\nHere's the best news: if you're a journalist who tells the truth and vets information before printing it and ensures you've got a story cold before you potentially defame someone; this will never be an issue for you or your sources.",

I mean I take serious issue with the lack of media literacy in America already, but since our schools are run by liberals/leftists who teach that heterodoxy is evil, there's limited chance of this particular facet of the world getting better before it gets worse. I'm fine with it getting a *lot* worse in order to make it better, just because we're already pretty damn close to rock bottom.\n\n> I am more inclined to trust the journalists, you are more inclined to trust Trump.\n\nOh I don't trust Trump at all- except that he'll do what makes him popular and generally will say what makes his supporters happy. To suggest I 'trust' a politician is something wildly outside my comfort zone, frankly. Politicians are liars professionally; and that's okay but that's their job. It's *not* the media's job however, but they do it anyway.\n\nI do think trustworthiness is a two way street and the media has taught us how much they have disdain and hatred for Trump and his supporters; so their word isn't much better than his on anything related to him, if you ask me. I think putting faith in today's journalists is just as silly as putting faith in Trump, if not moreso- they have a profit motive to make you pissed off and tuned in everyday, after all.",

Trump picked up on it later.\n\nI don\u2019t think it was covered in the MSM, but just this year it was proven beyond reasonable doubt that Barry\u2019s birth certificate presented by the WH at the time was a forgery.  They found the source documents the forgery was constructed from.  I saw the 1hr presentation of the evidence (corroborated by two independent forensics analysts) and it left no doubt in my mind it was a forgery.    The evidence was compelling.  \n\nDoes that prove Barry\u2019s not a US citizen and all kinds of other stuff.  No.  It only proves the Obama WH provided a forgery.  Anything beyond that is speculation.  However, it does make me less inclined to give the benefit of doubt when they\u2019ve been caught lying. \n\nAs such, I would not be inclined to convict anyone of slander.  Since no official evidence has been produced showing his birthplace.  Coupled with fraudulent evidence being passed of as genuine.",

Isn't the whole point of making them go through legal immigration to track them in the first place to have them pay taxes and receive those benefits? For example, if I applied for welfare right now, they wouldn't just give it to me a blank check, no questions asked, they'd ask for id and other identifying characteristics, including birth certificate. This just doesn't seem like a thing that's happening. Or is there a massive forgery operation supplying fakes of these documents or smth, and if so, where is the proof?????

If someone went to your employer and lied and said that one of your coworkers told them that you said some truly awful remarks, leading to hostile behavior towards you from your entire workforce. Would that be acceptable considering the damages to your personal life and the impact that would have on your daily work. Or should they perhaps have to prove that someone did, in fact, tell them that. \n\nThis is a personal attack, not a statement of opinion or disregard for an organization.\n\nLastly, I thought it was the longstanding belief that misinformation must be fought against.

They don't even require voter id in some states.  Why not just ban Americans from voting and let Mexico decide your next president? That's what they're pretty much trying to do.

People will say that's insane or I'm trolling but I've seen what happens when they are in charge and it's nowhere NEAR good. Therefore everything the left says is wrong is now correct.

If you would entertain me here, I'll give you a quick summary of the IRS thing I was referencing and you tell me if it seems like brainwashing to you.\n\n\\- A Treasury study was done that said the IRS could hire 87k employees over the next 10 or so years if they were given a bunch of money. That amount of employees included IT staff, agents, customer service, etc, and covered some amount of new employees and replacing employees that would retire over the next 10 years. \n\n\\- President Trump and numerous Republicans put out that the IRS was wanting to hire 87k armed IRS agents.\n\n\\- The IRS never stated anything about hiring 87k IRS agents nor was that specified in what was in the bill that supplied them with more funds. \n\nLike or dislike the IRS, I get it, but President Trump and Republicans continually seemed to be lying about these 87k IRS agents.\n\nWould that be an attempt to brainwash people with inaccurate information? \n\n[https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/605107/new-irs-agents-and-the-inflation-reduction-act](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/605107/new-irs-agents-and-the-inflation-reduction-act)",
