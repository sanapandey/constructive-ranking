    "selftext": "**Context:** [Perception of Trump as a successful businessman](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-gave-americans-business-trump-giving-businessmen.amp ) has drawn support. It\u2019s fairly common to hear Trump supporters express confidence in his (1) good business acumen and/or (2) his ability/intention to promote efficiency and reduce FWA in the government.\n\nBut asking, \u201cDo you think [specific action/EO] was efficient? Why or why not?\u201d won\u2019t provide me a shred of clarity if I have no idea what you think is efficient, etc.\n\n**Question:** If you voted for Trump because of the reasons above: How do you define good business acumen, efficiency, fraud, waste, and abuse in a government context?",

Everything government does costs at least 3 times more than if someone in the private sector did it.  A good example is the whole \"this meeting could have been a email\" thing. A decision that could have been made and communicated in 1 or 2 emails is turned into a 2 hour meeting involving thousands of dollars an hour in wages sitting around listening to 2 people discuss where a printer needs to be placed in an office. \n\nI was on that phone call and the US government paid me $360/hr to listen to it.",

To clarify, am I summarizing your perspective accurately with the following bullet points?\n\n\u2022 Efficiency in government = employee pay comparable to employee pay for the same services in the private sector, and the elimination of committee decision-making for investments below a certain financial threshold\n\n\u2022 FWA = employee pay that is significantly above the private sector, and committee decision-making for small dollar investments\n\n(Please correct me if not\u2026 I want to make sure I\u2019m understanding you before I dive into follow up questions.)",
