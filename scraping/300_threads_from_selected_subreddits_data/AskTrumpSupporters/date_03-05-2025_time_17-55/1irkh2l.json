We want competent, good people in our workforce. But right now we are cutting people willy nilly, with no consideration for what roles are crucial or which people are high performers. Look at the nuclear security administration. \"Accidentally\" fired mission critical staff, can't get them back easily.",

Why would any highly skilled person want to work for a government and a society that 1) hates them, 2) thinks they are rats or the \"deep state,\" 3) harassed constantly and called low productivity, and 4) has openly admitted that the goal is to cause trauma and make the workplace as unliveable as possible? What skilled person with options could possibly want to do that?\u00a0\n\n\nThis admin is creating a huge brain drain of the civil service. For all the talk about \"restoring merit,\" it appears to have been a lie. I would have CHEERED for layoffs of people who failed their annual performance review. I would have CHEERED at tenure being revoked for low performers. But that's not what they are doing. They are dismissing anyone they can, and they're not checking performance reviews, their duties, or their public safety mission.",

I think there is appetite even on the Democratic side for some reform of a lot of these offices and agencies as we all acknowledge that they don't work as intended. I think there is even some appetite for some reform of the civil service entirely and there was an opportunity for a bipartisan win for Trump. But they obviously have no intention of trying to engage Congress for anything. If you don't believe that there was an appetite for this on the left, go listen to Ezra Klein who I would say is as close to a voice for mainstream Democratic thought as you can find these days. He's been saying for years that there is obvious room for reform for a lot of government agencies and that things aren't working like they should. \n\nThe Democrats' biggest criticisms of this whole DOGE thing from the beginning has been that there wasn't a coherent plan. It was born from a contempt for civil service and that it was always just going to be a wrecking ball, and that seems to be exactly what we got. Musk, Trump and their associates have been open about saying that skilled employees should go work in the private sector, are you surprised that they are pushing people in civil service to do exactly that? Are you surprised by any of this?",

I believe if we actually went to the core of issues we\u2019d find a lot of common ground and could work towards real bipartisan solutions to issues, but instead it feels that so much of that potential common ground gets eaten up by tribalism and having to win against or \u2018own\u2019 the other side. It is refreshing and encouraging to see that a non-straight across the line TS opinion can arise here, so thank you. \n\nI am curious though, I don\u2019t know exactly how much of this approach towards federal employees was included in project 2025 or not, and it certainly wasn\u2019t something Trump campaigned on. Much of it feels like the same approach that was used for Twitter->X, so it feels very Elon driven, especially with him in charge of DOGE. Do you differentiate this between an Elon approach versus Trump driven, or are you feeling that if it\u2019s under Trumps\u2019s administration he owns it? As so many claimed it was people behind the scenes doing things in the Biden admin, I\u2019m just curious if that same perspective is being seen here or not. Does this give you a sense of Elon running the show versus Trump?",

In a nutshell, Trump wants to push Canada (and Mexico) to the negotiating table on various issues. \n\nHere\u2019s a link to the article (https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/trump-aides-want-to-hit-mexico-canada-with-tariffs-before-talks-3ff27f14?st=awscZp&reflink=article_copyURL_share) but there\u2019s likely a paywall so I\u2019ll paste the most relevant paragraphs below:\n\n>The president has tangled with both countries before and doesn\u2019t feel that Canada and Mexico are taking his threats seriously, some advisers said. He wants to hit them with tariffs first to prove he isn\u2019t bluffing, these people said, and to drive them to the negotiating table on a number of issues, from migration to drug smuggling and reforms to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement to encourage more manufacturing in the U.S.\u00a0\n\n>Trump on Friday reiterated his desire to make Canada the \u201c51st state\u201d\u2014saying that would save them from any tariffs\u2014and waved away any potential trade disruptions that could arise from increasing duties in February.\u00a0\n\n>\u201cWe don\u2019t need their cars. We don\u2019t need their lumber,\u201d Trump said of Canada. \u201cWe don\u2019t need their food products because we make the same products right on the other side of the border.\u201d\n\n>The U.S. imports billions of dollars worth of crude oil, lumber, passenger cars and bakery products from Canada. Economists say that adding tariffs to those items will cause prices on many basic items to rise for U.S. consumers. Trump and his advisers believe it will bring in more revenue to the U.S. and motivate more domestic manufacturing as well.\n\nMy additional thoughts if you got this far: The \u201c51st state\u201d comment was hyperbole, telling Canada the only way you\u2019ll avoid tariffs is to become the 51st state, or in other words, these tariffs are happening, period. It\u2019s kinda like saying, you\u2019ll avoid these tariffs \u201cwhen pigs fly\u201d or \u201cwhen hell freezes over.\u201d",

Tax cuts are stimulative, but never once \u2014 ever in history \u2014 do they stimulate enough growth to outweigh the reaction in revenue.  That is, yes, tax cuts spur growth, which in turn leads to a slight increase in revenue on that growth, but that increase never outweighs the lost revenue; hence tax cuts always massively balloon our deficit \u2014 far more than spending does.  So how are you ok with the tax cuts?",

I think ultimately it\u2019s hate towards Catholics that is causing this whole anti-immigrant attitude in the US, at least at its core.  There are a lot of Protestant, Republican, Christian conservatives who either outright dislike/distrust Catholics or who know that Catholics tend to vote democrat so they want to limit immigration of the predominantly Catholic Hispanic peoples to the US.

Article III of the U.S. Constitution establishes the judicial branch as one of the three separate and distinct branches of the federal government.\u00a0 I know its hard to deal with when your almighty leader decrees from on high that he can do whatever he wants with congressionally approved funding and he's stopped with the stroke of a pen from a judge - but thats how and why this system works.  If the judiciary does not have that power - who does?  The legislative branch?  Whoever is in control will either abuse that power or ignore, depending on who is in the White House.  So who's left to reign in a president who's off the rails? The answer is no one.\n\nImagine if Biden signed an EO banning private gun ownership.  I bet you would have no problem with a District Court Judge in Texas staying that order and declaring it unconstitutional.",
