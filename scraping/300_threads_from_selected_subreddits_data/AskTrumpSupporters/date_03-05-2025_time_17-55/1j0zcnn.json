It's short-term, but it pays well, and it's for a respected (heh) company.  We will see what comes from that.  Right now, I'm doing housework and cooking and all that, so it's pretty nice.\n\nWent out and played Magic yesterday.  I don't like Friday Night Magic in theory, because I don't like going out on Fridays (too many people over-indulging on the roads), so I left early and came home and snuggled my dogs and my wife.  I have a new deck coming in, which will let me play dogs and cats and I have my custom proxies for those counters, which are all my dogs and cats.  Well, all the ones I have pictures taken of.\n\nGetting laundry done right now.  I know, it's super-important.  Basically, when my wife is sleeping and the MIL is working, I am doing housework.  Gotta go check that in a minute so clothes are ready for next week.\n\n**Question:**  I refuse to answer.  Generosity and charity should be done anonymously and without bragging about it.  I think anyone who brags about how generous they are is not, in fact, generous.\n\n**Recipe:**  So, I went and got my hair did.  I look like a new man.  The salon I went to was right by my wife's office, so I met her for lunch and her friends were all asking for me to make this again for them.  I'm not one to tell a lady no.\n\nBrisket.\n\n* One full brisket.  Don't trim it, screw that.  Do not cut it.  You're paying for that meat, why are you throwing it away?\n* Salt and pepper, a lot of each\n* I like a mix of hickory and mesquite, but take your wood chips and soak them\n* Chimichurri (see later), fish sauce dip (maybe later, but it's just fish sauce, Thai chilis, and garlic), and Sweet Baby Ray's for those who think they need it.\n\nSo, beforehand, you're going to want to season your meat and soak your wood.  It's pretty easy, really.  Just put the salt and pepper on the brisket and let it sit at least overnight.  Put it on the smoke at about 200F and let it go until you can't take it anymore.  If you want a mop sauce, take equal parts cheap beer and apple cider vinegar with a big splash of paprika and garlic powder and mop it on every two hours or so.\n\nSlice thin and serve with pickles, onions, jalapenos, and bread.",
