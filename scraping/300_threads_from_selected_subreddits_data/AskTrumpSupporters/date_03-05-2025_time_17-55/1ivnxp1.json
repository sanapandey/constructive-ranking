Gender dysphoria is a very complex issue, you can\u2019t expect people to change their views overnight.

I do think gender and sex are different, personally, but I\u2019m not going to disown everyone who says different. That\u2019s not really how attitudes are changed.

I would prefer to not do that... I would instead ask: would you feel safe around the people who are attracted to Trump's rallies? Despite whether or not you think Trump is racist, birtherism/nativism is a strong component of the MAGA ideology, which DJT is the head of currently. Folks like Laura Loomer, Nick Fuentes, etc, have been in close proximity and in some cases amplified by DJT, and very much believe in racist/nativist ideologies.\n\nAs the old phrase goes (which has some merit): you are the company you keep.",

This disingenuous rhetoric helped us steamroll you in 2024, so you're going to have to collectively evolve into a party that's less insufferable - and it's laughably apparent Democrats don't have it in them.

Most people outside of Reddit and BlueSky experience this phenomena..... boy that cried wolfs, people just seem to don't believe people when they say X person is a Nazi because of lousy usage of the word Nazi. People use this word lightly and for really stupid reasons, so people stopped believing when someone says Nazi, they just ignore it as noise. You are contributing to it too, so don't be surprised when people outside of Reddit will not believe you. You don't believe me that this is the case? Then why do you think Trump won despite NS calling him a Nazi on every corner? Because people DO NOT BELIEVE IT, and it's your fault for that.\n\n\"Nazi salute\" means nothing, it was nothing like the stuff in WWII, he moved his hand at the side. This shit means nothing, just media fear mongering. You know what means something? Hasan Piker saying that Jews should be raped. Or racial tier list on Twitch Con with Jews at the bottom. This is real Nazi shit.\n\n\\> Again I ask, why do you think nazis and racists nearly unanimously support Trump?\n\nThat's simply not true, I know for a fact that Nazis hate the Jews with a passion, if you missed holocaust....... then....... eeh. And I know that Nazis HATE how Trump supports the Jews. You know who HATEs Jews? The left, the woke, Twitch, Amazon, BlueSky, Reddit, anti-Trump people, pro-Palestine crowd. All those are MUCH closer to Nazis than Elon Musk or anyone else really.\n\nCheck this out [https://behorizon.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nazi-salut-in-houthi-controlled-ares-1.png](https://behorizon.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/nazi-salut-in-houthi-controlled-ares-1.png)\n\nCompare their stance with Elon's. You notice they do it nothing like Elon did and pretty much exactly like Nazis did it? It's no coincidence because Muslims hate Jews, and hence, use Nazi shit like this. After all, their slogan is \"Allah is the Greatest; Death to America; Death to Israel; A Curse upon the Jews\"\n\nBut you know what? Hasan Piker that invited their member on the stream and who praised that member, who showed that he support them. Who said, and I quote, \"I see no problems with them\" referring to houthis.\n\nYou know what? People aren't going to whine about this shit and cancel like they do with Elon Musk calling him a Nazi, etc. You know why? It's simple, really. Because you are controlled by media propaganda. Reddit is full of hate on Musk on EVERY subreddit. For what, Musk a gesture that slightly resembled Nazi salute? Really? When Hasan Piker, the biggest political streamer on Twitch, calls for extermination of Jews, shows terrorist propaganda, shows how he supports a LITERAL video with houthis pirates hijacking a ship with innocent people, and then getting them as hostages.\n\nYou people are just led by a political party to hate on their opponents, you call out people for some stupid shit when there are REAL Nazis who do REAL Nazi salutes, who support slogans like \"Death to America, curse upon the Jews\". This is why YOU lost support and Trump won. Please, fix those things and then people will consider you to be good to vote for again, as simple as that. Twitch staff is antisemitic, we all know that. No one of you for some reason cares about it, you don't call Dan Clancy a Nazi and the dude is probably the closest thing to a Nazi, lol. For some reason people are excusing and protecting Twitch's Nazi politics. They banned the country of Israel, lol. They celebrate birthday of the rapist apologist, Hasan Piker. Dan fucking Clancy sang happy birthday to Hasan personally, the same Hasan who calls Jews pig-dogs, in-breads and calls for their complete annihilation\n\n\\> racists\n\nWho are those racists? People who say they want illegals deported? Those are not racist, those are \"criminasist\". They hate criminals and invaders and they want laws enforced. I was called racist by NS because I don't fucking want illegals in my country. Do you understand how crazy this shit is? NS use both words in the most light, most disrespectful and meaningless way possible, making light of those words, robbing them of any meaning. What did we come to? The world is crazy!",

And just view them as barbaric. I have nothing against the individuals that don't force their woman in weird attires and who do not want to partake in this Islam thing. I have a college from Iran and I don't hate him, he doesn't hate Jews, he doesn't make women dress funny, he is smart and is a good engineer. He is also not an illegal.

Just imagine how frustrated you get when you are doing everything right, and you are still called racist for the stupidest shit by the people who DO NOT KNOW YOU. I'm like the most chill person who speaks reason, and all I get, Nazi, Nazi, Nazi, racist, racist, racist. It's like a mantra or a slogan at this point, it get really tiring.

Actually, I saw people like that, most of them would be people that would be killed by actual Nazis in WWII.\n\nIt is dumb really, but IF there is a REAL Nazi. It should be German, and no other than German. Because........ Nazism is ethnic cult of revanchism of German peoples who blame Jews and believe in magical Aryan blood. That person HAVE to use \"Mein Kampf\" in a similar way as disgusting Marxists use \"The Capital\". And they would want to establish the Fourth Reich in Germany.\n\nThis is pretty much it. Most people who \"appear\" to be Nazis are just internet trolls and edgy teens who just use edgy symbolics for lols, because people get triggered.\n\nSome people like Nazi drip, because it's quite stylish. Just look at what Nazis and Soviet soldiers wore and you'll see why people like Nazi uniform, it's just considered to look cool, that's all.\n\nPeople who you want me to refer to, are most definitely wouldn't be Nazis, they would be fascist. There is literally pretty much zero reason to be a Nazi in 2025 even if you are evil and authoritarian or something. Nazis are too....... German, it's German centric and German esthetics. You most certainly want to refer to modern fascists. Because Nazis were most only in third reich. This all German stuff and Jew hate doesn't make much sense in 2025. Most extremist people choose Islam for similar purposes. They hate Jews and they are EXTREMELY traditional and the religion isn't centered around magic Aryan blood, but on faith in Allah.\n\n==================\n\nFor instance, I'm a hard core right-winger and my circle consists of mostly right wing leaning people.\n\nMy gf doesn't like trans stuff and views pride month as a clown fest. She is a hard worker and a person people rely on, she is the type who was a student council president at school (she indeed actually was, lol). And she dates me, who is not white. Well, my skin is pretty whitish, but ethnically I'm not white at all. My friends and I hate the Nazis because it's a stupid cult of magic blood that hyped on socialist populism. To be honest, I don't know any right winger who unironically thinks Nazis are right-wing. We mostly view them as far-left losers and people similar to communists in almost every way, except for a couple of things. I can say for sure that my family suffered DIRECTLY from communist and nazis. And I mean....... physically........ like war physically, because my family is from the Soviet Union. I hate both with passion. Sadly, I see a rise in Marxists extremists nowadays. People who unironically quote \"The Capital\" are the common place, while the people who quote \"Main Kamf\" are nearly non existent. Or just some edgy randos",

Hasan Piker is definitely the closest thing to a Nazi in 2025 when we are talking about public figures, he calls Jews in-bread and pig dogs and puts them at the bottom of racial tier list and you are okay with it, but when Elon moves his hand to the side (absolutely different gesture from houthis and Nazis), you freak out\n\n\\> Just because he acts exactly like one and his family were nazis doesn't make him one, because his personal and political beliefs do not match that of a nazi\n\nHe doesn't. Elon Musk is like the farthest thing from a Nazi just from his vibes alone, let alone things he does and say\n\n\\> I spend extremely little time on reddit, can you point to something I've said that\u00a0*objectively*most people disagree with? I haven't given any opinion, only relayed facts and made objective statements?\n\nUmmmmm, most things you said were opinions, and unpopular opinions I would say. Like Elon making a Nazi salute which looks funny but when you compare it with picture of actual Nazis and houthis, it looks nothing like a Nazi salute. I unironically downloaded them when you gaslighted me and were thinking you are trolling me by saying (it's exactly what Nazis did) because I'm pretty sure Nazis didn't move their hand at the side while having Elon's weird body posture. And I still would consider it weird to freak out because of gestures, because I'm freaking out from Hasan Piker that calls for holocaust 2.0 and people on the left seem to be okay with it. People on the right and centrists totally hate Hasan tho",

It's more like \"oh no, evil Nazis came and burned all the stuff, especially the Jewish things first and things that weren't in German and that were non-German-like, that goes against their values\". Which MAY include some trans stuff, but in reality, just read the list of things they burned.\n\nIf we were to ask ChatGPT to say what books were burned by Nazis, it will say:\n\nThe Nazis burned books they considered \"un-German\" or ideologically dangerous. These included works by Jewish authors, political opponents, and writers promoting liberal, pacifist, or progressive ideas. Some prominent examples include:\n\n1. **Political and Philosophical Works:**\n   * *The Communist Manifesto*\u00a0by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\n   * Works by Rosa Luxemburg\n   * *Mein Weg als Deutscher und Jude*\u00a0by Jakob Wassermann\n2. **Literature by Jewish Authors:**\n   * Works by Heinrich Heine (ironically, he once wrote,\u00a0*\"Where they burn books, they will also burn people.\"*)\n   * Novels by Franz Werfel\n   * Works by Stefan Zweig\n3. **Progressive and Liberal Literature:**\n   * *All Quiet on the Western Front*\u00a0by Erich Maria Remarque (anti-war novel)\n   * Works by Thomas Mann (Nobel Prize-winning author critical of fascism)\n   * *Berlin Alexanderplatz*\u00a0by Alfred D\u00f6blin\n4. **Scientific and Psychoanalytic Works:**\n   * Writings of Sigmund Freud\n   * Works by Albert Einstein\n5. **Cultural and Artistic Works:**\n   * Plays by Bertolt Brecht\n   * Modernist works by authors like James Joyce and Marcel Proust\n\nThe most infamous book burning occurred on May 10, 1933, when Nazi-led students burned thousands of such books across German universities\n\n========================\n\nTL;DR\n\nNazis were burning whole lots of things, those things were VERY diverse, they burned almost everything and lots of foreign sources. Especially the Jewish ones. Books on trans research WERE burned too. But when almost EVERYTHING were burning with influence outside of Germany, it doesn't make trans research something special, it was accompanied with diverse variety of such a huge amount of random stuff, that I would be surprised they weren't burned.\n\nI also wanted to post some links, to wiki and not only wiki, but Reddit doesn't allow me to post them. So I had to use ChatGPT that gave me pretty much the same stuff. Prompt was \"examples of books nazis burned\"",

Where did you even get that? What is the source? I was trying to find it, but every single source doesn't confirm what you say. For instance, I'm reading United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Nothing about them targeting or singling outing trans research over literally everything else. I saw things like \"They burned 25000 books and like few of them were trans research or something\". Can you provide a source?",

One of the first and biggest moves they made on that front was the destruction of the Institute for Sexual Research in Berlin which held a treasure trove of research, studies, and medical documentation on transgender individuals. \n\nAs for the words you're putting in my mouth, I never said they singled out targeting trans research over literally everything else \u2014 I said it was the first thing they did, and they did so explicitly and immediately.\n\nIf you want to start learning the fundamentals about what happened regarding the nazis and trans research I'd suggest starting with learning about the institute I mentioned.

Institute for Sexual Research in Berlin was JUST one of like all the universities, libraries, bookstores etc in like 34 university cities where books were burned on May 10. It was one of many and not even the primary target, the thing you don't understand is that Nazis don't like Jews. Compared to trans people, they were treated just like any other mentally ill people, like schizos, etc, no unique feeling. Their priority was Jewish sources, communist shit and then other un-German stuff.\n\nJust write in Google search \"the first books nazi burned\", the answer for me is from Wiki:\n\n\\> The initial books burned were those of\u00a0**Karl Marx and Karl Kautsky**, but came to include other authors, including Albert Einstein, Helen Keller, writers in French and English, and effectively any book incompatible with Nazi ideology\n\nThen I visited all the links on first page of Google. And NONE of them confirm what you just said. They all say what I'm saying, that university was just one of the things, like many other things, nothing special. The institution isn't even mentioned much. Special were Jewish and communist materials and expectedly, every source mentions that.\n\nAnd also, about Institute for Sexual Research, while transgender research was\u00a0**an important focus**, it was\u00a0**not the majority**\u00a0of the Institute's work. That institution was critical of fascism and was opposing Nazi things like forced sterilization and stuff.\n\nGive me a source that states what you claim because I found NONE",

Who on the Right wants an \"egalitarian\" white ethnostate? That is nonsensical and the are zero examples of anyone wanting egalitarianism on the Right. Right = Hierarchical. Left = Egalitarian. Woke = Zealously Egalitarian. \n\nEven before the Right started using \"woke\" as a pejorative, and the Left used it in positive terms, what the Left meant by the term was \"awake to injustices\" which the Left strictly defines in egalitarian terms. So, whether used positively by the Left or negatively by the Right, \"woke\" has ALWAYS been about egalitarianism. \n\nFor you to point out that the far Right and far Left both become illiberal and tribal is fine. But trying to say \"woke\" means illiberal and/or tribal is stupid because that's not what anyone has ever meant by the term. That's like saying that during the cold war that avid Reagan supporters were really \"communists\" because Reagan supporters really loved America and communists really loved the USSR. \"Do you not see the parallel!?\"",

The far Left believes everything is malleable, and subjective. Take LGBTQ nonsense - something we all recognize as \"Woke.\" The entire belief system of Woke is that gender is NOT immutable. It's something fluid, and malleable.\n\n>They are awake to the injustices of minorities for the left and for the majority for the right.\n\nUmmm... everyone is concerned with Justice, unless they're like a sociopath. You can't just blanketly say being concerned with injustice equals \"Woke.\" The distinction is in \"HOW\" injustice is defined. The Left does so in terms of hyper equality and universality - if anything is unequal, then it's inherently unjust. This is what \"Wokeness\" is. The Right, by contrast, defines injustice in terms of hierarchy and distinctions.\n\nI'm not sure how you'd define \"injustice\" unless you believe there is no such thing as Justice? Does belief in any system or understanding of justice make one \"woke\" in your view? It seems like you're saying simply placing value in anything makes something Woke.\n\nAgain, with my earlier example: Just because Soviets loved the USSR, and Americans loved the USA, doesn't make the Americans \"Communists.\" This would be taking one thing - \"allegiance to country\" - and saying that because both have that, then they are the same thing and thus both must be Communists. It's a really bizarre logical and semantic error which is exactly what you're doing by trying to say there's a \"Woke\" Right. Woke is the egalitarian belief and value system of the far Left, which is diametrically in opposition to the Right.",

He stated something obvious which is that no country refuses to accept their best people when you try to send them home, as just happened when he tried to deport criminal illegal migrants back to Mexico. Surprising, I know, but many people who break the law to sneak into another nation are criminals in other ways. All? No. Many? Yes.\n2. Trump asks why we are letting Haitians in and not Scandinavians\u2026(shithole comment) - He did not say Haitian people are all bad people. He said Haiti is a sh\\*thole country, meaning it is a disaster and not a first world nation. If he was wrong about some nations being sh\\*tholes then people would not be so angry that USAID won't be sending money to other nations. They can manage by themselves, if they are not a mess. Why are people sneaking into the U.S. illegally or for refuge if their nations are not sh\\*tholes in comparison to the U.S.? It is not politically correct. That's why it bothers you. It's not racist. \n3. Trump hates dei - DEI is racist and gives unfair advantages to people based on race. Plenty of white people grew up poor and struggled to get where they are and so did some Asian individuals, but according to DEI we need a quota for other races and if we have someone more qualified who is Asian or white they get sidelined to meet the quota. It's racist and sexist. Hiring should be based on skill and merit only. \n4. Trump appointment Supreme Court judges that got rid of affirmative action - Affirmative action was unfair and about equity, not equality. Equality of outcome is not fair in any way. Some people are naturally more intelligent and more skilled than others. This is not based on race, but fair is allowing people to advance based on their abilities and contributions. Equal opportunity over equal outcome is the ethical approach. \n5. Trump said their were very fine people on both sides fiasco (Charleston) - This has been debunked many times. You are leaving out the part where he said \"*I\u2019m* ***not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally*** *\u2013 but you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay?*\" Here is one Source: [Trump Has Condemned White Supremacists - FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/02/trump-has-condemned-white-supremacists/)\n6. Trump told women of color in congress to go back to where they came from. - This comment was towards multiple Democrat members of Congress and the exact quote is \"Why don\u2019t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came\" which is a damn good question when they were criticizing the United States harshly while benefiting off of tax payers and some of them are immigrants, such as Ilhan Omar, and others are first generation American, such as Rashida Tlaib. Don't claim you want to serve the people if you want to trash talk our nation while being angry a third world nation we financially support was called a sh\\*thole because that is beyond hypocritical on their part.

In our timeline, assuming we live in the timeline where Musk was not intending any Nazi related imagery, this not-crazy layperson   minority person could accurately observe that Musk has yet still made no attempt to clarify or make clear it was not a nazi salute. A not-crazy average minority voter perhaps could see it as a Nazi salute (even mistakenly) because he has only seen it used like that by Nazis, and he does not have access to Musk\u2019s not-Nazi thoughts, but has observed no retraction, apology, or a clarification that Musk was not doing the Nazi thing and assumes it must have been the Nazi thing. Could it be reasonable, even if mistaken, for a minority average busy layperson person to feel uncomfortable at an event, such as CPAC, where that salute (whatever ostensible meaning it may have to the maker of the salute) observed it has again been employed? I\u2019m not saying that person is right, but would you say they could in good faith mistakenly see it as a Nazi salute and be nervous about participating in a group, such as CPAC, or the Office of the President, who tolerates the gestures use?",

Trump also said California is the worst state. Does that mean he is a stateist? Trump also never got problem with high skill Indian or Vietnamese immigrant (H1B visa war). He however considered 3 white nations of Denmark, Canada, and Ukraine as his worse enemy if you follow the news \n3. Asian also hate DEI. Many black male also hate it.

Trump also said to Liz Cheney to stand in front of the gun. Does that means he is racist against white or stateist against Wyoming? \nOf course, I found the minority of Trump fan that openly racist to be problematics. And as a former Trump supporter, I do think his side should do more to eliminate these.

For instance elevators, access ramps, and accessible parking? Furthermore, do you find that somebody in a wheelchair or without a limb which causes no direct effect on their output of work somehow unequal to an employee without? Additionally, are you opposed to veterans applying for positions in the federal government or Veteran Affairs since it so closely relates to being a DEI hire? And finally, if DEI is systematic racism, is someone physically disabled holding a federal job considered racist in your opinion?",

Disabilities have nothing to do with race, how can this be racist?\n\nWell, having a blind person in charge of budget OVERSIGHT is extremely fraudulent , retarded and stupid (the dude is clearly EXTREMELY restricted to effectively OVERSEE ANYTHING, let alone fraud), but it's not racist, if you feel better for me to acknowledge it :)",

I felt like Obama started off as this unity candidate,  and society was pretty racially unified at that point anyway. 1980s style pop bigotry was back in the mix to some degree in the 00s, just like now. But it wasn\u2019t a big cultural ideal. So maybe it was just easy for Obama to promote that vibe.              \n\nIn any case they somehow evolved into racial grievance hustlers. It\u2019s awful.                   \n&nbsp;\n\n\n[Here\u2019s Michelle Obama at the DNC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgJBFBwRXvc) talking about how Black people will never benefit from generational wealth (she and Harris both did) and how most *us* will never benefit from failing forward (which Harris did), and...         \n\n\u201cwe\u201d don\u2019t have the luxury of whining or cheating others or changing the rules so \u201cwe\u201d always win.

I\u2019d say that\u2019s true for a huge segment of TS. Maybe even most, though many conservatives will just vote whoever\u2019s Repub. A huge amount of drama online is Supporters showing how they\u2019re moderate or even liberal, and Anti\u2019s just refusing to believe it.                \n\nI don\u2019t think Trump is very conservative at all, except that he\u2019s wildly pro business across the board.             \n\nI\u2019m not and I have big environment/ national park  concerns with Trump. It\u2019s a hit I had to take.  American jobs are a high priority for me.                      \n\nAnd also, I basically feel like Democrats hate America, men, and white people at this point.                     \n&nbsp;\n\n>how we can get back to more balanced journalism.              \n\nPeople gotta realize it\u2019s not an institution.

With jobs.                        \n&nbsp;\n\nIt is utter division-hustling for her to pretend like this wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s point\u2026 that instead he\u2019s using some racist term for manual labor  like he\u2019s from the rural South circa 1955.                         \n&nbsp;\n\n> when do you see our country truly shifting towards a \"race blind\" society?                \n\nPeople often present \u201crace blindness\u201d sarcastically.            \nIn the past ten years or so they\u2019ve been conditioned to think it\u2019s absurd.              \n&nbsp;\n\nI think the opposite: It\u2019s absurdly privileged to think most people have the luxury of caring about race. I think that mostly comes from a suburban childhood to safe college to cushy office job pipeline.         \n&nbsp;        \n\nDealing with people, I have to scan for traits that affect me. Karens at work, frat guy types, boomer biker dude, crazy homeless person, teenagers, urban thugs and gangsters\u2026 the list goes on. Skin color doesn\u2019t make that list.                 \n\nIn my teens and 20s, \u201cnot seeing color\u201d was the cultural norm for young people. I am incredibly race blind. I\u2019m not especially great, so I tend to think all the people saying the same thing are also not lying.            \n\nThere will always be some racist people. But I\u2019ve heard   people say \u201ceveryone is a little racist\u201d and such\u2026 no they\u2019re not. It\u2019s actually ridiculous.                            \n&nbsp;\n\nAlso worth considering that the Civil Rights era was when our society reacted *against* regional racism. It\u2019s easier for you and I to go to Puerto Rico now than it was for most people to go to somewhere like Mobile in the 1950s and 60s. The highway system didn\u2019t even exist. Train tickets cost a $1000 in today\u2019s money.            \n&nbsp;",

Instead, I'll provide an anecdotal account and ask if this is \"normal\". \n\nI immigrated from India and have lived in the U.S. from a very young age. I have experienced my fair share of racism from all groups (white, black, asian, hispanic, etc). However, by far the most amount of racial encounters have been unprovoked and have largely come from white americans. The mildest being mean stares. However, I've had many negative interactions simply by existing in a space with predominately white individuals. This has happened in restaurants like Cracker Barrel Chick Fil A, or at events like Gun Conventions and the only Trump rally I've ever been to. I've also predominately experienced this kind of racism in Red states like Alabama, Tennessee, both Carolinas, Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, and even my home state (Florida). In the end, I try to be the better person and fight this racism with kindness.  \n\nMy own friends who are either Indian immigrants or are Indian but born in the U.S. can corroborate some of these experiences themselves. All I ask is, do you believe that this constitutes as \"Normal\"? In 99% of instances, simply existing in white-dominated spaces is enough to get stared at despite no negative behaviors from myself. I've tried to be open-minded and dismiss the stares as \"curiosity\" but even then, it gets to me sometimes. I personally don't receive this treatment in liberal spaces (colleges, densely populated areas, etc). What are your thoughts?",

We know the anxiety of an ex-Democrat or new voter who is minority, legal immigrant, gay, or even female is probably high coming to a MAGA event due to the labels put on Trump voters. Since we know those people may feel uncomfortable, we go out of our way to make them feel more welcome than we would a life-long conservative. The labels are put on us by the media as well as the far left and far right. Believe it or not, we are not the far right. The Nick Fuentes types are and they are a minority of us. A lot of Trump voters can't stand them. Anyway, my ADHD has veered me off course, but my point is it is likely just human nature to gauge how friendly we need to act for a new person to be comfortable. We can normally tell by body language or from questions like this that a new person needs extra love to feel comfortable so we do our best to provide that. Sorry this is so long, but I hope it helps.

And I am not aware of any minorities reporting being mistreated at these events.\n\nThese events focus on populist themes.  They feature entertainment: music, stories, jokes, which is why they've had good attendance.\n\nPlenty of famous minority folk that like Trump.\n\n[https://www.essence.com/celebrity/black-donald-trump-supporters/#79389](https://www.essence.com/celebrity/black-donald-trump-supporters/#79389)",

And Jewish!\n\nHe was more of a \"kin-type\" White nationalist, to be honest, and he had some land he was developing to create a place for him, his family, and those of his friends who shared his views to live.  He was also an outdoorsman and wanted to be as self-sustainable and off-the grid as possible.  That's where I came in.  I have about 15 years experience, as a hobbyist, really, in self-sustainable projects and food preservation and so I assisted him in creating a viable aquaculture system, developing a proper smokehouse and dairy, selecting animals to raise on his land, etc.  He was very interested in solar power, but that was outside of my experience, so he went with someone else on that one.\n\nHe developed a nice little \"compound\" for his group out in the middle of nowhere, and while I am not exactly invited to gatherings or whatever, we stay in touch.  His money was, and still is, green and what he wants to do on his land is my business only if he's paying me.",
