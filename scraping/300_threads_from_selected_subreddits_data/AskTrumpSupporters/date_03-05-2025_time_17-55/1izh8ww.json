There's also leaked texts from victims where they detail having to lie to the Tates in order to get a hold of cops to escape the violence and abuse, a transcript that Tate's team then went on to edit by rearranging and removing parts of it to make it look like they said they're lying to cops, which Tate fans like you latched on to without ever looking at the actual officially released transcript.\n\nWhat do you think about these?

To me, there's little difference between these guys, Diddy, and Epstein. They're all guilty of the same crime, and they all had the same lack of remorse. If anything, Diddy and Epstein seemed to have more remorse than the Tate brothers... but I won't waste time convincing you of what you probably already believe.\n\nTo continue answering your question... last I checked they're on extremely bad terms with Trump, so the idea of the Trump administration being behind this would be very surprising and confusing to me. (Like, they openly campaigned against him and continue to voice disapproval of his actions.) So... idk. If this is true, and if this is a political move, I think it's sick. There's not even any benefit to the Trump administration for doing this, seeing as the Tate brothers have no sense of loyalty or gratitude, and are hated by the vast majority of Americans.

The report, which cited unnamed sources, noted that the issue was first raised by U.S. officials on a call with their Romanian counterparts and brought up again by Trump\u2019s special envoy Richard Grenell at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month. In a post on X, Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said the U.S. had not \u201cmade any requests\u201d or \u201cdemands\u201d regarding the \u201clegal situation of well-known foreign influencers investigated by the Romanian authorities.\u201d The country\u2019s foreign minister Emil Hurezeanu confirmed having a discussion on the matter with Grenell, but told reporters that the conversation was \u201ccordial\u201d and he did not perceive it as an effort to pressure Romanian authorities.\u201d\n\nIn other words: \n- The article cites no evidence that the Trump administration did what the post\u2019s title claims. \n- Its whole thesis is that the decision came after an anonymously sourced report dropped by a Democrat press operation. \n- This theory has been directly refuted by both the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Romania. \n\nInnocent or guilty of these specific charges, the Tate Brothers are really bad guys \u2014 no question. That Grenell discussed them at all is inappropriate. Beyond that, the story has no legs \u2014 it isn\u2019t journalism. It\u2019s Reddit-style commentary in article format.",

If this is a Britney Griner situation and they committed crimes in Romania they should *probably* stand trial there, especially if the crime is a crime in the US also (eg. sex trafficking). If they've been charged with rape in the US though they should've been extradited by Romania ages ago and brought to the US to stand trial- so dunno why they had a 'travel ban'? If they're Romanian citizens though it is even more confusing why they'd be extradited.\n\nThis is a very weird article that doesn't provide a ton of background so I'm at a bit of a loss as to what we're supposed to care about here.
