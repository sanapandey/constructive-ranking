They proudly referenced it on their enrollment applications. For example, I have a niece who just applied to a University that specifically said they were looking for DEI students. This is illegal now so the school said are adding a place on the application to include a letter about people's diverse background as a work around.\n\n\n\" Do you think the government should be able to dictate what someone studies?\"\n\nA government with trump at the helm yes especially with Elon involved.

We're giving huge loans to students who choose majors that don't lead to lucrative careers. Who's pocketing all that money? The universities. If it weren't so easy to get a loan, tuition wouldn't have increased so much in recent years. Federal loans create induced demand and lead to a system where the universities pocket ever more federal money and university students are saddled with crippling debt. Discontinuing federal loans will be a shock, but tuition will come back down to earth and students who need loans will choose majors that lead to careers that will help them pay off their debt.\n\nUnlimited loans for sociology majors is just terrible policy.",

I'm not gonna give you that 'pay back what you owe' schtick because you know as well as I do half the people who say that shit would jump at the opportunity for free money even if they insist otherwise.\n\nNo, my reasonings are many.\n\nFirst off, it doesn't equate to your college tuition disappearing.  It's still being paid for, it's just now it's being paid through taxes.  Now you might think that's no big deal - your college tuition being spread out over the millions of US citizens, that's pennies to the person right? Yeah.... except.... wouldn't you know it... EVERYONE ELSE whose student loans are being forgiven are ALSO being tacked onto that.  In 2023, 4.1 million college students graduated.  I don't know the number for 2024, but presumably, it's similar.\n\nSecond off, related to the first, you're not the only one who has to deal with that - you're effectively shoving the burden of your taxes off on people who didn't ask for it, didn't try to convince you to go to college, had nothing to do with any of that, and condescending to them, telling them that they are morally obligated to pay for your education.  That's simply not right.\n\nFinally, it doesn't actually tackle the real problem with college tuition.  Colleges make unreasonable demands from students in terms of tuition, demanding an absurd amount of money, and wringing college students of everything they have.  Then, they have their teachers look at you and speak to you in support of politicians who promise forgiveness for college loans - but NEVER for any sort of reformation and making college tuition actually cheaper.\n\nSay you forgive student loans for one year - then what? The colleges don't stop charging an arm, a leg, and a firstborn child for your education.  Next year, you'll have people demanding the same thing.  Then again, and a gain, and forever until either college reform happens, or we go bankrupt - whichever goes first.  Student Loan Forgiveness solves nothing.",
