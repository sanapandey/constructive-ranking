That\u2019s why there\u2019s this general consensus that we must get behind whomever the media is attacking the most. \n\nYou and I might disagree with that logic and think it\u2019s flawed, but we should at least be understanding of why they think that. Remember, your boy Bernie got a character assassination too. \n\nOh regarding the Super Bowl, you are right. I think Trump should have used his own money to attend especially since he\u2019s a literal billionaire.\n\nThe lock her up, yeah that is hypocritical for them to hold the other side accountable, but not their own. But hypocrisy is a two-way street. MAGA would argue that there\u2019s a double standard for Trump and Democratic politicians. \n\nPlus, two things can be true at the same time. Trump could have done something wrong, and at the same time some of those charges were trivial and the primary motive for those charges were to hurt Trump politically which backfired on them. \n\nAll I can say for Hunter Biden is that yes it was wrong for the intelligence community and the outcome of the 2020 election might have different had that story not been censored.",

What will be the best, lead to the least suffering, & is the least evil action? Leaving Gaza to fester in extremity is just going to create another situation like this where war breaks out again. Last time Egypt offered to take in Palestinians the Palestinians then attacked Egypt as well. We cannot avert our eyes & naiively think things will just work out if we leave the people in the same situation that started this mess. It will be even more brutal the next time then. Having existentially opposed populations next to each other is not working.\n\n\nI do not know what the solution is, it is a terrible situation. I would rather it all be kumbaya but it isn't, it isn't going to be. If you can find some brilliant navigation through that Hell then by all means tell me.\n\n\nAs far as I can see there is no better alternative, only equally bad ones. This may be the best possible option for both populations, terrible as it is, because otherwise, eventually, one will exterminate the other.",

I have a sincere question that I hope will elicit variety of you perspectives.\n\nBelow is the full introduction to the .[Wikipedia article about Ethnic Cleansing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing). Nothing has been changed or omitted except for the citations for readability\n\n###Ethnic Cleansing\n\n>Ethnic cleansing is the systematic forced removal of ethnic, racial, or religious groups from a given area, with the intent of making the society ethnically homogeneous. Along with direct removal such as deportation or population transfer, it also includes indirect methods aimed at forced migration by coercing the victim group to flee and preventing its return, such as murder, rape, and property destruction. Both the definition and charge of ethnic cleansing is often disputed, with some researchers including and others excluding coercive assimilation or mass killings as a means of depopulating an area of a particular group.\n\n>Although scholars do not agree on which events constitute ethnic cleansing, many instances have occurred throughout history. The term was first used to describe Albanian nationalist treatment of the Kosovo Serbs in the 1980s, and entered widespread use during the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s. Since then, the term has gained widespread acceptance due to journalism. Although research originally focused on deep-rooted animosities as an explanation for ethnic cleansing events, more recent studies depict ethnic cleansing as \"a natural extension of the homogenizing tendencies of nation states\" or emphasize security concerns and the effects of democratization, portraying ethnic tensions as a contributing factor. Research has also focused on the role of war as a causative or potentiating factor in ethnic cleansing. However, states in a similar strategic situation can have widely varying policies towards minority ethnic groups perceived as a security threat.\n\n>Ethnic cleansing has no legal definition under international criminal law, but the methods by which it is carried out are considered crimes against humanity and may also fall under the Genocide Convention.\n\nMy questions: \n\n1. How closely do you think that a hypothetical forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza and seizure of the territory by the United States and/or Israel would resemble the above description of ethnic cleansing?  \n  \n2. Do you think it's possible that, even if this scenario was an act of ethnic cleansing, in this case it could be morally justified? If so, how?",

The Palestinians don't want peace.  They have demonstrated that with their actions for decades.

No amount of concessions from Israel, other than complete removal, will ever be enough.  If they left their settlements, there would be new demands for additional concessions.  And Israel at some point would have no choice but to hold it's position, then we'd be back to where we are today.\n\nIt's unfortunate that we've come to this point.
