    "selftext": "I just watched James Klug's video of visiting Long Beach State (video of the title is \"Long Beach State: Did This Debate Warrant Assault by Students?\") and I really think influencers like James, Brett Cooper, Amala Ekpunobi, Brad Polumbo, Blaire White, Buck Angel, etc. are who is changing the woke game and waking people up. They definitely woke me up from how I was raised as a liberal.",

What?\n\nThat said, yes just as Ben Shapiro was a gateway drug to conservatism beginning around 2016/2017, a new crop has arisen though I'm not sure I'd put Buck Angel in that list.\n\nShame on you for not mentioning Scott Pressler.",

Idr when he said he started to be one but he\u2019s a huge advocate in preventing men being women\u2019s sports and transitioning children. I\u2019ve never heard of Scott Presslar. I\u2019ve been finding conservative influencers based on who YT recommends me to watch. It started with Ben Shapiro, then the other Daily Wire shows (including Brett Cooper before she left), Amala Ekpunobi, Blaire White and I just kept going down the rabbit hole from there.",
