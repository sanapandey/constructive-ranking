    "selftext": "I've seen Trump threaten numerous things over the years, tariffs, attacks on enemies, etc, but, to me the first month of this administration has seemed quite over the top as compared to last time. We are getting ready to sanction Canada, and Mexico, and some weeks ago he had said he'd do that, and then we pulled back. \n\nHe had also insinuated that 'all hell would break loose' if Hamas didn't release all the hostages by a certain date, and that day came and went and at least from the reporting I've seen 'all hell' hasn't broken loose. \n\nI feel like it might be leading to a 'boy who cried wolf' scenario where Trump keeps making threats and then no one believes him anymore. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this and how it might change the geopolitical landscape regarding the United States and the world?\n\n[https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87d5rlee52o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87d5rlee52o)\n\n\"Trump agrees to pause tariffs on Canada and Mexico but not on China\"\n\n[https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-threatened-hell-hamas-free-hostages-happened/story?id=118932854](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-threatened-hell-hamas-free-hostages-happened/story?id=118932854)\n\n\"Trump threatened 'all hell' if Hamas didn't free all its hostages.
