    "selftext": "I\u2019ve noticed a lot of criticism toward Zelensky and a lot more sympathy toward Putin (less so but more than I\u2019d expect) coming from a lot of MAGA accounts on X, but I wasn\u2019t sure how much that was representative of the greater movement so I\u2019m curious what this sub thinks. What are your thoughts on the two leaders? Not just asking about them in the context of the war but obviously that will understandably be the context that a lot of us know and view them through. ",

While I don't like the US funding Ukraine in its efforts against Russia its getting to a point where I'm like just go for it because Russia needs to be defeated and Ukraine must win so I will applaud Zelensky standing up to Putin and not capitulating into Putin demands.\n\nAnd for anyone reading this You may be confused as I am a trump supporter so I will say this I may support him but not 100% I like his policies but I'm not loyal so I will have disagreements and the way he has been handling the Russia-Ukraine situation is embarrassing and showing his weakness to not standing up to Putin.",

It isn't meant to be, but I'm going to go stand out in the cold and collect my thoughts.\n\nSo first off, we have absolutely no idea what is actually going on in Ukraine right now.  Many stories have been proven false in the past, and I'm at the point where, sincerely, I don't know what to believe.\n\nI think Zelensky (should the y be doubled?) is a man who has proven himself pretty well in a situation I would not want to be in, at all, but I don't necessarily agree with all his actions.  That's okay.  I don't think I would ever agree with every action taken by a leader whose country is being invaded by a so-called superpower.  I'm not saying he's in the wrong here, and, as I've mentioned, I managed to raise a small amount of money for aid in Ukraine with a gaming group, but I'm not a political leader and I do not know all the reality of the situation there.\n\nI think Putin has a legitimate reason to attack Ukraine, at least in his eyes.  I don't agree with it at all, but I can understand it.  Historically, Kyiv is the heart of Russia.  It's where the Kyivan Rus came from, and that's where Russia got its name.  I understand that's not what he's arguing, but that's what I see behind it.  I, personally, think it's a garbage reason, but I can understand why someone might think otherwise.\n\nNow, I admit I'm a little biased here, as my only real interactions with Russia was having a Russian pen-pal in second and third grade (I would send them candy and stuff, they would send me nesting dolls and likewise).  I sincerely believe that, at this moment, the war is Russia's to lose, but I think that Ukraine is basically messed up no matter what.  And I hate that.\n\nI think Zelensky has done an admirable job trying to defend a small nation against a, well, MASSIVE one, but I think he needs to think more about losing less than winning.  It sucks, but unfortunately, it's reality.  Russia is going to gain land and access and all that, and it's a horrible thing, but it's also geopolitics when a nuclear nation attacks one that is not.\n\nI just wish it wouldn't be the case, but basically, THEY HAVE THE BOMB, and until something is done about that, Russia can keep biting off pieces of whatever they want, and that's the way the game is played.  We don't like it, we don't want it, but it's just the way it is.",

If the answer is fight for them, do you understand how frustrating it is for other countries to finger wag at our wartime leader then lecture us about how we should cede our land for the sake of peace and how countries sending us arms and helping us fight our invader are merely enabling the conflict and contributing to the death of Americans? There\u2019s peace and there\u2019s justice. Ukraine wants justice and so would we. Am I making sense?\n\nThis is why these talking points delegitimizing Ukraine\u2019s need for arms and aid, criticizing their leader, and saying how Russia\u2019s invasion was merely defensive and how it\u2019s Ukraine\u2019s fault that the war is still ongoing, are all considered anti Ukraine sentiment.

Most people don't question that he does horrible things.\n\nThe context is the role that western intelligence and warmongering play in this scenario.  Putin would be viewed quite negatively if not for the vibe this conflict gives off of another attempt to destabilize a nation that we don't control.  It gives the impression that both the West and Zelensky have willingly sacrificed many Ukrainian lives in the attempt to turn this situation into an attempt to depose Putin and gain more influence into Russian affairs.  So instead of ending the war earlier and negotiating.... They continued to throw more lives into the furnace to gain that leverage.\n\nThis side mostly didn't feed into the propaganda of the Ukrainians always winning.  Sure they might have some wins.  They could even win 2 to 1.... But they pretty much needed to win 9 to 1 to succeed without bringing other armies into the fight.  So to us, it just looked like international intelligence was just urging Zelensky to sacrifice his population to destabilize Russia.\n\nThis perception shifted an otherwise completely negative leader like Putin into someone whose negative aspects aren't as relevant in the present situation.",

A military organization is a very different story. Secondly, Brics is geographically scattered all across the globe. NATO, while spanning multiple continents, is a military organization that makes up the bulk of Europe and the majority of Russia's European borders. The organization was created for almost the sole purpose to oppose the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union dissolved, NATO should have dissolved. Instead it expanded eastward despite requests from Russia to stop. NATO needs to fabricate an enemy to justify its existence. \n\n\nSo your analogy falls short because of the very different purpose, nature, and geography of the different organizations.",

And it seems like Ukrainians feel the same way and is the whole reason they were willing to fight against the odds as much as they did. \n\nIn my opinion, the west needed to either put everything they had into Ukraine early on or surrender them immediately. I appreciate the Biden admin for leading the charge and essentially giving NATO a new energy and purpose that they haven\u2019t had in years, but it needed to be all or nothing, and Biden, understandably trying to avoid escalating tensions with Russia too much at once, didn\u2019t give them all.\n\nYou can understand why people are frustrated with the narrative you laid out right?",

So the US under Trump and the backing of other countries of the world is going to go to Putin and try to strong arm him into agreeing to terms, and then go to Ukraine and say you can keep fighting or agree to these terms Putin already agreed too. It's a hostile negotiation so having the 2 parties in the same room isn't productive. \n\nNot saying I agree, or disagree, global peace negotiations are way above my pay grade. That is the summary I extracted from the brief video and the history of Ukraine's rejection of negotiations thus far.",

I took Russian in college in the early 00\u2019s and my Russian prof was an American who lived in Russia post Perestroika in the Peace Corps (very crunchy, granola liberal type) and she was a Putin super fan (odd now, all things considered) \nI think he genuinely wants what\u2019s best for Russia, but I also think he has imperial aspirations and because of his love of Russia he\u2019s obsessed with restoring what he thinks is Russia at its peak, as the Russian Empire. You could argue he acts as a tyrant to achieve those goals and has kept himself in power because he thinks he\u2019s the only one who can achieve that goal.  \nThat said, I\u2019m not terribly interested in motives, and CS Lewis said it best when he argued that \u201cthose who torment us for our own good will torment us without end, for they do so with the approval of their own conscience\u201d. Regardless of his motives, he\u2019s killed, imprisoned, likely tormented, violated human rights merely to retain power. He\u2019s ignored US intel that led to his citizens being murdered by terrorists for his own ego. He\u2019s a tyrant, and as an \u201cex\u201d KGB agent he\u2019s not trustworthy. His friendships with China and N. Korea are also of great concern. Russia is a highly complicated country, and there\u2019s been very little, if any, part of its history that wasn\u2019t marked by some sort of dictatorial regime. \n\nZelensky I\u2019m also not a fan of. His cancellation of democratic elections should have been condemned by the media and international community but instead he\u2019s referred to as a \u201cshining example of democracy\u201d. If Trump did that of course that likely wouldn\u2019t be the descriptor used. I don\u2019t like how he\u2019s been in a stalemate war with NATO support and US support and then has the temerity to intimate he\u2019ll accept no deal that involves a loss of Ukrainian land, which is fine if you\u2019re funding your own war, but a little like saying you won\u2019t accept a job offer until they offer you $100k a year while your parents are funding your unemployment and you dropped out of high school. \n\nAll in all I have to say I\u2019m not a fan of either one. I wish Russia had a leader with a respect for human rights and focused more on making Russia great instead of making Russia an empire again.",

I know most people on the left is bias against Russia and supportive of Ukraine, but I think Putin did what was right for his own country. Putin felt that the threat of NATO influence was jeopardizing his own power, and wanted to stop that. I think for there to be a long-standing peace deal, both Russia and Ukraine need to give concessions because there is blame to go around.\n\nCall me a Russian puppet or asset all you want, but what\u2019s the point of constantly antagonizing Russia. That\u2019s the neocons who want that. They want to escalate tensions, so in the future we have a reason to be in a direct confrontation with them. For the people who blindly support Ukraine, I wonder if you will have the same reaction when Russia drops a nuke on America.\n\nThe correct framing is I\u2019m just America First. For the people who said we can do both, I have yet to see any evidence of that. I think we should normalize relationship with Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\n\nChina is a bit tricky because I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s any other way around of getting out of a Cold War with them. China wants to topple the American Empire, hard to talk them out of that. But I\u2019m still supportive of Trump plan, to denuclearize and have Russia, China, and U.S. cut defense spending by atleast 50 percent.",

From my understanding, Ukraine gave up its nukes in the 90s in exchange for recognition as a country and also military protection by the US.  If the US leaves Ukraine to die,  doesn't that send the message that nuclear disarmanent is a bad thing, that those with nukes can bully those without, and the only way to protect yourself is by acquiring nukes? Won't that risk increasing the number of nukes in the world and increasing the chance of nuclear war in the future?",

                                    "body": "I am not naive to expect no concessions. Since we have been effectively tying one of Ukraine's arms behind it's back by forcing it to fight only on their own territory for most the war, unless the US and European allies are willing to send the resources needed to actually push the tide back and take risks escalating the war to actually try to defeat Russia, I don't see an outcome where this doesn't continue to drag on without both sides giving concessions.\n\nIf Trump can end this in a way that favors both sides and brings peace to the region, then my hat will be off to him for that. However, am I wrong to be worried that Ukraine might get back-stabbed by Trump trying to force a deal on them that overwhelmingly favors the Russians and is effectively a defeat for Ukraine? Meeting with the Russians to discuss a peace deal without the Ukranians involved, claiming the US wants closer ties with Russia, Trump trying to spin the war being [Ukraine's fault](https://fox59.com/hill-politics/trump-says-zelensky-should-have-never-started-war-triggered-by-russian-invasion/) and that [they shouldn't have fought back.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-suggests-ukraine-not-fought-back-russia-rcna189071) These don't exactly inspire high confidence for me in the outcome.\n\nAs I said, my concern is that every other country is looking to what happens here to determine their own future actions. We've been living in a retaliative peaceful and stable world as of late because most countries can expect the US and it's behemoth of a military to step in if things get too out of hand. If they can't trust the US to have their backs, they will turn to other countries that can, AKA China, or start massing their own weapons, which only weakens the US's influence globally and amplifies the risk of more serious wars in the future. Looking towards America first is a great thing, but not if it weakens us due to no one being able to trust us.",

Putin is not a suicide bomber. He\u2019s got kids he adores and he lives a very comfortable life. If he nukes Europe, Moscow to Chita to Serbia to North Korea is turned to glass 7 seconds later.\n\nWhen did you come to fear him?",

That\u2019s not defense\u2014that\u2019s imperialism.\n\nSupporting Ukraine isn\u2019t \u201cantagonizing Russia\u201d; it\u2019s pushing back against authoritarian aggression. If we let Putin succeed, what stops him\u2014or China\u2014from doing it elsewhere? Wouldn\u2019t pulling back signal weakness and invite more conflict long-term?\n\nI get concerns about endless wars and military spending\u2014those are fair. But how would cutting defense by 50% with Russia and China actually work? They\u2019re authoritarian powers that expand when they sense weakness. Wouldn\u2019t that just embolden them?\n\nBeing \u201cAmerica First\u201d should mean strength and smart alliances, right? How do we stay strong globally without giving countries like Russia and China a green light to expand their influence unchecked?\n\nCurious how you see that balance. What would a realistic path to peace actually look like to you?",

Putin felt that the threat of NATO influence was jeopardizing his own power, and wanted to stop that.\u00a0\n\nUkraine getting closer to the West is indeed threatening Putin's power, but not Russia as a country. These two things are very very different. Putin didn't attack Ukraine because Russia was in danger (it has 5000 nukes, it will never be in any danger), he attacked it because western influence in Ukraine would erode his power. Don't you think you are conflating things? \n\n>I wonder if you will have the same reaction when Russia drops a nuke on America.\n\nThe chance of Russia dropping a nuke on America is just as big as America dropping a nuke on Russia. Almost zero. But only americans got scared of this empty threat, russians didn't. \n\n>The correct framing is I\u2019m just America First.\n\nI am an eastern european so I might sound biased. Sure, I understand your point. But the thing is letting Putin get  the upper hand in Eastern Europe is just a short term monetary gain for USA.

I'm assuming you're citing the Cuban Missile Crisis as starting the Cold War (which is wrong). Even in that case, considering that we put nuclear missiles in Turkey first, would you agree that we didn't really have a position to be pointing fingers?\n\nb.) Russia signed the Charter for European Security in 1999, which stated Ukraine, as an independent nation, could join whatever security alliances they wanted. They could have joined the \"Vladmir Putin Can Lick An Unwashed Day Laborer's Taint\" alliance, and been in agreement with the terms. Ukraine decided not to pursue the NATO option and remain neutral to avoid antagonizing Russia, up until Putin decided to occupy and annex the Crimea in 2014. \n\n\"Ukraine's terms were \"we'll give up our nuclear weapons and not join NATO if you don't invade us\", and Russian invaded them multiple times. Since Russia didn't hold up their end of the deal, why should Ukraine be forced to hold up theirs?",

If Russia gets it's way, Zelensky will likely be jailed or killed when everything's said and done. Do you think that might have a bigger part to play than money?\n\nAs for Russia feeling threatened by Ukrainian missiles: What damn missiles? Ukraine didn't even start thinking about a domestic ballistic missile program (Hrim-2) until 2007, and considering the shenanigans during Ukraine's 2004 election, they had good reason to want weapons systems that weren't 30 years old and dependent on Russian parts and servicing. Putin threw a stink when 2021 when Ukraine was considering [ballistic *defense* systems](https://www.cidob.org/en/publications/putins-red-line-over-ukraine-new-test-european-and-transatlantic-resolve) (Patriot SAMs) in response to, uh, Russia stacking a [bunch of missile systems](https://www.csis.org/analysis/moscows-continuing-ukrainian-buildup) on their border. Ukrainian missile programs *still* aren't producing missiles, and if Ukraine was stockpiling them in preparation for their apparently obvious neo-Nazi invasion and genocide of Russia, why didn't they launch any missile strikes until the US approved ATACMS use 3 months ago?\n\nAs for the land \"belonging to Russia\": What the hell does that even mean? We've had very clear borders established since Ukrainian independence, signed off on *by Russia* in the various agreements they broke. Ethnic Tatars in Moscow don't get to claim the city for Turkey, why should ethnic Russians in Donbas get to rewrite borders? Does Russia have a right to reclaim all of the USSR states? Does Mexico have a right to claim half of the US back since there's a bunch of Spanish speakers?",

                                    "body": "This is a myth used by Russia to justifiy their expansionist foreign policy. It is regularly debunked.\u00a0\n\nYou can read more about it here,\u00a0https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/china/disinformation-about-russias-invasion-ukraine-debunking-seven-myths-spread-russia_en?s=166\n\nAnd I copied the main parts here as well:\u00a0\n\nMyth 6: \u201cThe current crisis is the fault of NATO and the West. If they had honoured their promise not to enlarge the alliance, Russia would not feel threatened.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSuch a promise was never made, nor was it ever asked from NATO. Russian state-controlled media have often claimed that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was promised \u201cverbally\u201d that NATO would not expand beyond the reunified Germany. In fact, Gorbachev himself denied this claim in a 2014\u00a0interview, saying that, \u201cthe topic of \u2018NATO expansion\u2019 was not discussed at all, and it wasn\u2019t brought up in those years. I say this with full responsibility. Not a single eastern European country raised the issue, not even after the Warsaw Pact ceased to exist in 1991.\u201d\n\nNATO members never made any\u00a0political or legally binding commitments\u00a0not to extend the alliance beyond the borders of reunified Germany.\n\nThe claim alleging that NATO promised not to enlarge fundamentally misrepresents the nature of the alliance. NATO, as a defensive alliance, is not \u201cexpanding\u201d in the imperialistic sense. Decisions regarding NATO membership are up to each individual applicant and the current 30 NATO allies. Every sovereign state can choose its path and bordering states \u2013 in this case Russia \u2013 have no right to intervene.\n\nMyth 7: \u201cBecause of NATO\u2019s aggressive expansion, Russia is now \u2018encircled by enemies\u2019 and needs to defend itself.\u201d\n\nNo country or alliance is plotting to invade Russia. No one is threatening Russia. In fact, the EU and Ukraine are staunch supporters of the established European security order. Remember that Russia is the world\u2019s largest country by geography with a population of more than 140 million and has one of the largest armed forces in the world with the highest number of nuclear weapons. It is absurd to portray Russia as a country under acute threat. In terms of geography, less than one sixteenth of Russia\u2019s land border is with NATO members. Of the 14 countries Russia borders, only five are NATO members.\n\nThere is also no argument that would suggest that military force is the only solution. There are several international organisations, bilateral agreements, and formats where Russia can engage in a collaborative and peaceful dialogue \u2013 for instance in the OSCE framework and arms control regimes. The EU keeps channels of communication with Russia open as an integrated part of the EU\u2019s Russia policy of five guiding principles. There is no shortage of established formats for communication. However, as a sovereign country, Ukraine has every right to choose its policies and alliances. The notion that Russia should have a veto power over Ukraine\u2019s sovereign decisions is baseless. In this regard, neither the EU nor NATO claim to have a veto on which states may be a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), because the EU and NATO are not party to that treaty.",

So much for being a puppet of Putin btw\n\nTrump said, on live television that Zelensky shouldn't have started the war with Russia. He also stated that he(Trump) would have struck a deal with Putin that would have prevented the conflict. He elaborated on this by saying he'd just give up the land in said deal, effectively forcing Ukraine to be absorbed into Russia. Nevermind the fact that Ukraine wasn't even invited to peace talks *concerning their sovereignty*\n\nDoes this change your view about him being Putin's puppet?",

It very much feels like trump leans into American imperialism rather than away from it. \n\n\u201cEspecially now that we now know that WMDs were a massive hoax\u2026\u201d\n\nI\u2019m also curious to know how you can rationalize your concerns here, given that some of the main proponents of the WMD claims, people like John Bolton, were hired by the trump administration in his first term? Bolton was also a huge proponent of striking Iran, which trump ultimately ended up doing with his assassination of Soleimani.",
