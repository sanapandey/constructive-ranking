On top of the data he\u2019s already centralized over the last few weeks. Does this seem smart? Part of the problem with centralized data like this is security, where the data goes, who has access to it, what they\u2019re using it for, etc. Elon has talked in the past about wanting to run the government with AI, do you think this is what they\u2019re trying to do?",

We send American forces to retake all of Ukraine. Europeans will send token forces to say \"they participated\". Meanwhile, all of our American families who have send people to WW1, WW2, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War, etc. have family members who come back in body bags, missing limbs, or PTSD. Nobody comes home unscathed.\n2. We negotiate a deal where the new borders are somewhere along the front lines. Bonus if we can make trade deals that ensures Ukraines security. But the idea of punishing Russia when they hold all the cards (nearly unlimited men to fight compared to Ukraine), or insulting them is not how you make a deal.\n3. We say fuck it, let Ukraine fight to the last man. They will not win this way, at all, and they know it.\n\nBut see, nobody really wants to think this through. So distraction on a level of mean tweets, memes, AI videos, etc. keeps you all distracted. That is all you want to talk about. Real policy requires thinking and is difficult, and sometimes there is no solution that everyone would think is great.",

Because that requires no education or thinking at all. Its like visiting a relationship sub on Reddit.\n\nThis is why the vast majority of questions all over Reddit are \"Why did Trump say this?
