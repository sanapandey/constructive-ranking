Again, 4 years to do that. No Congress required.\n\nBut now that DOGE is looking to cut waste, Dems are like \"Hold on, we need to take our time! What about if we CUT TOO MUCH??? You don't want to SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT do you???\"\n\nIt just reeks of insincerity to me- Dems want to pretend they are interested in making cuts, so they can kick this to a congressional committee, to produce a report, to present to another committee, who might draft legislation that Dems will just vote down in Congress. \n\nIt's like Dems just haven't read ANY of the recent audits done of government spending when they already found billions in waste and billions more they couldn't verify. The accountants have already spoken - now is not the time for research, now is the time for action!",

Why are programmers and hackers the ones tapped for the job?  \n\n\"Consultants\"? Seriously? They're literally a money pit. [NYC paid consultant McKinsey to tell them to use...garbage bins for $4M](https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-hired-mckinsey-to-assess-the-citys-waste-needs-2024-7)...rats [chewed through them anyway](https://nypost.com/2025/01/30/us-news/rodents-apparently-gnaw-through-dense-rat-proof-trash-bins-mandated-by-nyc/).  \nAccountants are familiar with corporate tax code and company law...what familiarity do they have with the legacy systems in use by the government?   \n\nYou use the word \"hacker\", seems like you are a non IT person. I believe most of the people working at DOGE would be suitable for the role of a \"Data Scientist\". They hired \"Data Scientists\" not \"hackers\".    \n\nDo you have any knowledge about Elon's hostile takeover of X and the engineers who helped X on a path to profitability in just 2 years? They're quite literally the most qualified people for the job because they don't just have the skills but most importantly they have experience on taking over unfamiliar systems rapidly.\n\n\n> Do you agree with Yarvin that \u201cdemocracy is done?\u201d\n\nThe essay sent by your friend says a lot of stuff like \"Government functions that once belonged to democratically accountable institutions are already being transferred to proprietary AI systems\" without any proof or citations to back the statement up. I thought Democracy was done as early as 1913 when the Fed was created.  \n\n\n\n> Do you find it at all worrisome that the vice president has publicly expressed alignment with Yarvin\u2019s ideas? I get that he isn\u2019t the president, but he\u2019s a heartbeat away.\n\nLove it, can't wait for the transformation until 2037. America endured 12 years of FDR, 8 years of Clinton, 8 years of Obama, 4 years of Biden, 4 years of Carter, etc. so it can certainly ensure 8 years of Trump and 8 years of Vance.  \n\nWhen the right wing complained about Big Tech, we got told to go fuck ourselves, that Section 230 protects them all. Now Big Tech is with us and all you have left is Bluesky and Reddit. Good luck!  \n\n\n> Do you believe that perhaps some elements of governance should be refined or outsourced to AI?\n\nAgain, it seems like you're from a non-tech background. The term AI has been in use all the way back to the 20th century when they called any new revolutionary robotics or voice/vision technology AI. I think computers should replace most of the government desk jobs because all they're effectively doing is moving files from one folder to the other. I don't think jobs that require investigations or field visits will be replaced by AI - but even those jobs should be augmented by AI. Those employees who cannot use AI to double their productivity should be replaced by those who can. \n\nIf the smart employees were aligned politically, it would be good news for them. GitHub Copilot has been multiplying my productivity many times for the past 2 years - now everything else is getting a \"Copilot\". But that doesn't work if the employees themselves do not use the AI or work at all. We need both, \"copilots\" to assist employees to be more productive and AI embedded in all analysis and data systems.  \n\nThe only people I do not want being influenced by any LLM potentially trained on far left material is the judges and to an extent the judiciary as a whole, or just the idea of a bit of code deciding if someone gets a life sentence or not - that is dystopian indeed. But the Democrats have put in activist judges so it won't be any more dystopian than communists running the government.\n\n**Libertarian techbros taking over the government won't be any more dystopian than Marxists, socialists and communists running the government.**  \n\n> Any other general thoughts and/or takeaways from the essay?\n> A friend in Germany\n\nNot one of the questions you asked, but I felt the need to mention that Europeans enjoy American protection (all of the other NATO countries together don't even add up to American contribution), they [laugh at America when we complain about them buying energy from the very nation America spends billions to protect from](https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/currencies/trump-lashes-germany-over-gas-pipeline-deal-calls-it-russias-captive-idUSKBN1K10VH/) and enjoy trade deficits and tariff advantages (US has no national sales tax; EU has VAT which effectively acts like a customs duty). Then they use their position to take in millions of migrants and subsidize their welfare instead of funding their own defense.  \nBut when we pull out of their unfair deal - they come on Reddit and complain about American politics and healthcare, mocking America and politicians that align with \"America\" instead of a bland globalist state. In 2024, Reddit's users finally became majority non-American. I hope that trend continues - Reddit should not influence Americans at all but just be a laughing stock for all of the users on Instagram, Threads and X. Like how Discord is a laughing stock.  \n\nCanada and the EU as a whole are on a decline. I believe Trump knows their position and does not want to bail them out for nothing in return, hence all the mockery of them as the 51st state and so on.",

The one thing that AI will allow, is centralized control over the AI systems themselves, where a government of workers (people) allows for distributed (democratized) work. Eliminating the people now puts the entire government apparatus in the hands of just a few people who control the AI, and that is very anti American, and anti democracy. Which is exactly what Yarvin, Thiel, and Musk have spoken about. Why would we be cheering on the installation of a fiefdom, where the ones creating it have openly talked about their plans to use mass surveillance, AI, drones, crime prediction, etc to manipulate and control people into subservience? Isn\u2019t that exactly what the 2A folks said they\u2019d fight against?",

I think they'd hopefully have some foresight to not give give a future Democrat something that is more powerful than the nuke codes.  \n\nI think the new \"AI\" systems will do fine for many decades, then a century later my grandkids will fight in the Butlerian jihad. I don't know if anything can change that. But I'm in my early 20s and I want a better life, which I'm sure most of the people approving the creation of the Federal Reserve also did.\n\nWe will see what has been done on July 4, 2026, when DOGE expires. Whether it is LLMs replacing government employees or literally bog standard \"AI assisted\" analytics being provided to auditors like the OIG (aka huge IF ELSE alarms manually coded in by data scientists).  \n\n\n\n> distributed (democratized) work\n\nThat's where you're wrong. It's not distributed. It's controlled by the Democrat Party. Just like Big Tech was in 2020, before Musk bought Twitter. What did you say to us when we uttered the forbidden words - \"S*ecti*n TWO THR33 Z3RO\"? (Had to avoid a direct mention - there's a lunatic on Reddit who will reply to you if you dare to mention that section's name in full)  \n\nIt is a fact that the Federal workforce and the DC population in general is highly partisan:\n\n* [Majority of their political donations are to the Democrat Party](https://www.fedsmith.com/2021/02/12/political-donations-and-federal-employees/)\n* They [subverted Senate-confirmed political appointees to prevent Trump from implementing his agenda in his first term](https://americafirstpolicy.com/issues/20222702-federal-bureaucrats-resisted-president-trump)\n* [43.4% of the DC population works in the gov, actual number likely higher due to NGOs with majority government funding](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-many-people-work-for-the-federal-government)\n* [DC votes 92% Democrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_the_District_of_Columbia), is one of the most partisan districts in America\n* Along with the NGOs, a significant chunk of the news media [is in bed with the Democrats](https://nypost.com/2023/04/26/biden-cheat-sheet-shows-he-had-advance-knowledge-of-journalists-question/) too, with [just 3% of journalists identify as Republican](https://www.allsides.com/blog/just-3-journalists-identify-republican-how-can-newsrooms-mitigate-bias). And [the remaining 3% are still less partisan than the Democrat media when their party is in power](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/12/14/american-journalism-sounds-much-more-democratic-than-republican).  \n\nDOGE is more than just replacing the gov. with big tech. It's also draining the swamp in DC. That's what I love about it, and I hope Musk acts even more aggressively in the limited time he has as a SGE.      \n\nWhat is simply happening is that [bureaucrats who subverted the chief executive officer of the US](https://americafirstpolicy.com/issues/20222702-federal-bureaucrats-resisted-president-trump) are getting checked and removed. Just like what what happen to you if you swore at your company's CEO during work hours in work meetings.",

I go on subreddit after subreddit seeing a bunch of federal workers planning resistance against the elected administration that has a popular mandate. Assuming you are correct, which I don't think you are, I would rather have a 3 headed hydra than one with 300 thousand heads. At least you can keep an eye on 3. \n\nAs for AI, this is probably going to be an inevitable progress and if it is going to be effective, it can't and won't be beholden to specific interests. We have been spending increasingly more and more on government and have seen nothing but shrinking returns. Science isn't progressing proportionally to the number of scientists. We spend more on health than ever before and Americans are sicker than ever. We spend more and more on military contractors only for them to ship jobs overseas. How many invisible generals over the years have there been handing over ludicrous sums of taxpayer money over to defense contractors only to retire and start collecting paychecks from those interests? We spend 200 thousand dollars on each new Stringer missile that cost us only 35 thousand in 1991. Has inflation been 500 percent? Has the cost of manufacturing really gone up that much? While I'm on the topic, how about the fact that NATO expansion has been fueled entirely by special interests in weapons manufacturing so that when new countries join they can be paid enormous sums of money to sell weapons that will bring the new country to the same military standard. Where has what you call democracy been during all of this? Is this democracy to you? It isn't to me. Institutions that once upon a time sprang forth from some democratic process are not holy or to be revered, they ought to be judged the same as anything else, and if they are rotten they should be cut out without remorse.",

                                            "body": "> What do you think of this\n\nI could explain my argument to a reasonably smart 6th grader - the hoops the article goes through to explain Why Orange Man Tariffs Bad is insane.\n\nFirstly, the article is talking about something purely hypothetical. Most states do not have a deliberately pyramiding sales tax nor do the sales tax rates in the US match the EU VAT rates. There are laws that dictate all items being resold shouldn't be taxed again - and that manufacturers are exempt from paying sales tax on raw materials.   \n\nThe US does not have the sales tax system that they are using as an example. Besides, it's not like the EU is overly friendly to manufacturers with their oh-so-generous VAT system, they have [crazy taxes on producers too](https://thefishsite.com/articles/norway-sets-salmon-tax-at-25-percent). The system is designed to extract the maximum possible money, not to be generous in avoiding double taxation.        \n    \nAnd even IF the US had a system like they are proposing, the raw number I quoted in my previous reply makes it quite clear that the US does not tax consumption as much as other countries do.\n\nTaking an extreme example, Alaska's 1.82% sales tax would need to be applied 10 times over to match a 19% VAT rate in Germany.  There's a reason why they need to quote hypothetical examples instead of real numbers - the real numbers would likely increase support of the Trump tariffs.  \n\nIf a state has poor sales tax law (still not even close to the extreme proposed in the article) that makes it even slightly harder to avoid such double taxation - there are 49 other states for a business to move to, to keep that state in check. Precisely what's happening with the exodus of businesses from California.  \n\nIncredibly poorly thought out piece of EU globalist propaganda. Anyone with a brain should be able to sniff out that neither of their comparisons are anywhere close to reality.  And we haven't even talked about the lopsided regulatory burden preventing the entry of American companies in these countries.\n\nThe most ironic bit of the article is them admitting that the businesses will pay any part of the tariffs at all:\n\n>  any increase in US tariffs will ultimately be paid by US businesses and consumers\n\nIt has basically become a Democrat talking point that tariffs will be solely paid by working class Americans. It's the first time I've seen them admit the cost to businesses in one of their fugazi astroturfing articles.    \nThe point of the tariffs *IS* to make the businesses who don't manufacture in America pay more, to incentivize them to manufacture in America. The tariffs do not discriminate on whether the beneficial owner of the US importer is US based or a foreign company. \n\nSame with illegal migrant labor - hire Americans at American wages instead of. hiring illegals and using government welfare schemes to sponsor the rest of the living costs for the migrants and the Americans with displaced jobs.  \n\n   \nWith the tariffs being reciprocal in nature, there's a double incentive for the opposing country to lower their tariffs or domestic incentives as well. The US fought hard for Boeing when it came to the A220 (result: they're produced in Mobile, AL now) - so it can certainly do the same for smaller manufacturers.  \n\nThank you for proving Trump right.",

And it is a big if they move to the US, it might be not economical. \n\nHowever way it turns out,  this will result in the same product becoming more expensive.

But in some cases it is in fact deliberate.  \n\nAt the end of the day, states have their own budgets to balance, their own debts to pay. They're basically like individual EU countries.  \n\nA low but non zero sales tax in the state of manufacture hardly makes as much of a dent in the price as the high sales tax in the states of consumption like California.\n\nIf all states had a free trade agreement with California, what would happen is that instead of the smaller state taking 2% of the final sale price and the bigger state taking 12%, California would simply increase its taxes to be 16%. There's a certain incentive for the tax hungry consumption states to not be too greedy with pyramiding as an option.  \n\nBigger states often force other states to follow their law. California has Prop 65 and CCPA which basically all other 49 states must work with. There are also income tax reciprocity agreements. But so far the system has been self regulating. States like NY and California really got too big for their own good.   \n\nAs I linked, the VAT system does not always avoid countries from wanting their hand in the jar. Norway's salmon tax is basically a sales tax on the salmon imported to EU countries. They charge for the land instead of on the goods directly. But the land is required to produce the goods.\n\nALSO, the Federal government allows deductions for state and local taxes (SALT deduction) up to a capped amount. Do the EU states allow VAT deduction on income tax?",

                            "body": "From Grok\n\n\nSummarize \"The fall of complex civilizations\" by Joseph Tainter\n\n\nHere\u2019s a summary of The Collapse of Complex Societies by Joseph A. Tainter, based on my understanding of the work:\n\nJoseph Tainter\u2019s book, published in 1988, explores why complex societies throughout history\u2014such as the Roman Empire, the Maya, or the Chacoans\u2014eventually collapse. Tainter argues that collapse isn\u2019t primarily due to external factors like invasions or environmental disasters, but rather an internal dynamic tied to the nature of complexity itself. He defines a complex society as one with centralized decision-making, social hierarchies, and specialized roles, all of which require energy and resources to maintain.\n\nTainter\u2019s central thesis revolves around the concept of diminishing returns on complexity. As societies grow, they invest in problem-solving mechanisms\u2014bureaucracies, infrastructure, military, agriculture\u2014to address challenges like population growth, resource scarcity, or external threats. Initially, these investments yield high returns, improving stability and prosperity. However, over time, the benefits diminish while the costs (in energy, labor, and resources) increase. For example, adding more administrators or building bigger irrigation systems might solve immediate problems, but each additional layer of complexity becomes less effective and more expensive to sustain.\n\nEventually, this leads to a tipping point. When a society can no longer afford the escalating costs of its complexity\u2014especially under stress like drought, war, or economic decline\u2014it becomes vulnerable to collapse. Collapse, in Tainter\u2019s view, is a rapid simplification: a reduction in social stratification, economic specialization, and centralized control. He sees it as an economizing response, where people abandon unmanageable systems for simpler, more local ways of living.\n\nTainter examines historical case studies, like the Western Roman Empire, where he argues that overexpansion, heavy taxation, and reliance on conquests led to unsustainable complexity. The empire\u2019s collapse wasn\u2019t just barbarian invasions, but a breakdown of a system too costly to maintain. He contrasts this with societies that avoided collapse by adapting or staying less complex.\n\nThe book challenges romanticized views of collapse (e.g., moral decay) and catastrophic explanations, offering instead a rational, economic perspective. Tainter suggests modern societies, with their reliance on technology and energy, face similar risks if the returns on complexity keep declining. It\u2019s a dense, academic work, but its core idea\u2014complexity has a price\u2014resonates as a warning about sustainability and resilience.\n\nI will say that we have seen this trend in research. Specifically we spend increasing more money on science and there are increasingly more scientists, but annual advancement seems to stay at a constant rate. https://youtu.be/QtxjatbVb7M?si=rD3rApBZjhdNNOYb\n\nA good isolated example of this is in the field of \"clean hydrogen\". We keep spending more and more money on this stupid method of energy storage, it employs increasing numbers of people, does nothing for the environment, and we are no closer to solving its fundamental problems than we were 30 years ago. Biden before leaving office threw billions at the industry, the US should demand a refund, it is a scam.",

The website is not exhaustive, things have been cut that do not appear on it. It also consistently uses yellow journalism tactics . For instance, they will take a quote from a white paper and characterize it as the entire purpose of that grant. If it contains anything relating to DEI, the word \u201cempowerment\u201d, or a few other buzzwords, that quote is pulled and held up as the mission statement of that program. I would expect a transparent government to say something like \u201cthis is our interpretation of this program, here is a link to their white paper.\u201d Cherry picking quotes and misleading the public, while leaving out tons of information, is not transparency. \n\nThere is also nothing about the associated cost of cutting some of these contracts and programs. Just scrolling through the last few post, the ONLY \u201csavings\u201d that are over a million dollars come from either cutting contracts, or cutting funding to the IRS. Cancelling a contract generally has associated cost, why are these not enumerated? If it makes sense, if the cost of completing the contract is greater than the penalties, than great! But we aren\u2019t being given that information. As for cutting IRS funding, the IRS takes in 7 dollars for every dollar we spend on it. That could be restructured to both decrease cost AND increase that return per dollar, but I\u2019ve seen nothing indicating that\u2019s the plan, not even a claim that that\u2019s the plan. \n\nYou could see how I would be wary to trust an organization that claims transparency while only posting a marginal amount of information, right?

Pretty much every scam involves the first part, that\u2019s why people call it a \u201chustle\u201d. The second part only comes into play if some sort of return is promised. \u201cYou just need to send me $500 dollars, and you\u2019ll have ten grand in a week.\u201d Then a week passes, and they need three more, and another 500 for some processing fees that came up. I\u2019m very worried that in our case the next \u201cprocessing fee\u201d will be cutting services to the elderly and the infirm. Cutting employees in the already woefully understaffed social security department is already pretty much doing this, there is no way to slice it where that doesn\u2019t lead to more delays in a system that is already rife with delays. People paid taxes their whole lives in exchange for those services, they don\u2019t deserve financial hardship, or in some cases disaster, due to unnecessary delays. Those are also some of our cheapest federal employees, we could have taken 5000 jobs that legitimately were wasteful and hired 8000 more people for that dept, and broken even.\n\n2. Lies of omission. Doge is a small part of the story of what\u2019s changing in the federal budget. If somebody presented me with a contract, pointed out all the good clauses and was like \u201cthere\u2019s no downside!\u201d, but when I looked closer it was much less in my favor, that person would lose my trust. Even if they said \u201cOK, well, I guess it has a few problems, but it\u2019s still pretty good overall!\u201d I would still assume they weren\u2019t telling me everything.\n\n3.Actions and words not lining up. By this I mean the aforementioned tax cuts that mainly go to wealthy earners, combined with raising the debt ceiling.\n\nWe both care about this country and are deeply concerned about the direction it\u2019s headed in.

Even the grimmest predictions of the debt crisis project it becoming an irreversible problem in about 12 years, if we stay on the current trajectory. And even in that timeframe, we could have done a six month audit and had 12 months to enact this. You said it yourself, maybe not the smartest way to do it. Why wouldn\u2019t we do things in the smartest way? \n\nYou say they wear their heart on their sleeve, and maybe they do. But to my mind, even than Musk is at best someone who gets overexcited about a new idea, overestimates his own capability to execute, and than moves on to the next shiny new idea. I get it, I do that. People like that can be good to have on a team, but they shouldn\u2019t be leaders.",

It's basically impossible to get into a funding round with a project he is starting - I know, I've tried.\n\n2 - You might be seeing with negativity bias here. I agree in some cases  he has over promised (i pre-bought a roadster... i know) and under delivered. But look at all of the ways he has insanely over delivered. People looked at the tesla battery tech and thought it was designed by aliens. It literally birthed a whole industry when he made the patents open source. There is 0 competition with spaceX, it's in a league of its own. Starlink is about to put telecoms out of business. Grok set the bar for no bullshit, thorough AI responses. I could go on and on. \n\nedit: and the reason why he didn't stop and set expectations I blv is because so few people actually understand where we are at in terms of a complexity/ bureacuracy tipping point and possibility of hyper inflation. It's just not talked about at all as it's so politically toxic to even bring up. No one likes to be the bearer of bad news. The US (and many other nations) have to go on a diet if we want to stay afloat. There is no other way around it. \n\n\nIn short - he's not perfect.

If the fed was going to invest in a single company to encourage electric car's, they were 100% the best choice at the time. Besides that, almost no company gets their first round of funding from the public, and characterizing it as \"People he trust\" isn't really accurate. These are the same types of investors anyone would court for a startup. Beyond that, he has used the public to fund the actual manufacture of these cars in the form of, as you said, customer preorders. It has been years since one of the projects that used preorders to jumpstart manufacturing on has lived up to it's promise. So the initial investors absolutely got what they wanted, a high stock valuation. The normal people who put their faith and money into the company got delays, unfinished products, and insane wait time's for repairs. \n\nWhich leads me to the second point. Characterizing Musk as some sort of Patron of open source tech is not exactly accurate. They could have provided a license/cert for other companies to repair their cars, as well as a requirement that mechanics be required to finish training to allowed to work on them. But, this would have required them to compete in cost with independent repair shops, which would drive the cost of repairs down and necessitated timely repairs. Of the Tesla owners I know, the number one complaint is expensive and slow repairs. \n\nTesla helped lobby for laws that curtailed hobbyist from modifying their own vehicles and electronics (and sued a couple of people who were doing interesting work that I was following), which had echoing, innovation stifling effects. This ones big for me, this is where I decided i didn't like the guy. People should absolutely be free to tweak products they own, so long as they don't try to turn a profit off their discoveries. The battery is also only kinda open source, if you use it you have to turn any related patents that your company creates based on that tech over to Tesla. It's a smart move business wise, but it sure as hell isn't charity, and the associated risk is why many EV manufactures don't use teslas tech. The current longest range car from Lucid does not, for instance. And \"Designed by aliens\"? come on man, it's got a neat cooling manifold but it's nothing revolutionary. I'm sure there were people that said that. He's good at getting people excited. But that's not really a good metric.\n\nI could go on, but the rest of my points would boil down to he doesn't make this tech, engineers do. He strikes me as now too unstable for leadership. An excellent start up CEO is not necessarily the best long term CEO. I'm excited about satellite networks and getting to mars too, like extremely. But people are cancelling starlink contracts because of his instability and signalling that he will abuse his authority (like trying to disrupt service to Ukraine at the beginning of the invasion). Other companies are getting to a point that they can compete in this field, which is good for consumers. SpaceX is great, but if it follows the same pattern as his other ventures of over promising and under delivering, it's going to curtail the public's already extremely low appetite for space exploration.",

Well, let\u2019s look at the situation:\n\n1. Every **non-Doge** person with system access has, at best, been complicit and, in many cases, actively worked to maintain a system built from the ground up to prevent accountability.\n\n2. Every agency involved has refused to provide the information required for oversight\u2014either out of malice or because point #1 shields them from having to do so.\n\n3. When given any warning or opportunity, these agencies have demonstrated that they will actively attempt to prevent meaningful oversight\u2014shuffling programs around, misleading about expenditures, etc.\n\nThese realities demand a **hostile approach**. So yeah, I think the best solution is close to what we have: an outside team granted sweeping access (which, thanks to an Obama-era authorization, is already on the books) moving quickly to secure control. Then, given the massive extent of waste and abuse (fraud is a legal definition best left to the courts, in my opinion), you shut everything down and only restore programs that can be cleared.\n\nWill it cause some chaos? Sure.\n\nWill there be mistakes? Sure.\n\nBut any softer approach will prove useless because these agencies have effectively made themselves immune to conventional oversight or audits.",

But the way people on Reddit are threatening Elon's life - is multiple orders of magnitude more risky than what he did when he took over X.   \n\nHis own companies and his SGE status will be a conflict that I'm sure Ds will abuse, despite his companies almost always being the most efficient and cheapest option.   \n\n> that fraud the air traffic control\n\nhttps://www.yahoo.com/news/diversity-hiring-cost-job-faa-081042821.html\n\nThe fraud was done by the FAA, not the individual ATCs. If they were not hired due to merit, they should be let go. It's not anything like working at the DMV.  \n\n> the park rangers\n\nhttps://www.eenews.net/articles/burgum-promises-to-hire-5000-temporary-park-workers/\n\nFully support that too. Almost everyone on social media complaining about being fired was someone with incredibly partisan politics, pronouns on profile and so on. We cannot have these \"resistors\" in govt any longer.   \nFire them all and rehire MAGA rangers. It's what every Democrat has done - where were you when people got fired after refusing the jab? You didn't care? Why should I care, then?",
