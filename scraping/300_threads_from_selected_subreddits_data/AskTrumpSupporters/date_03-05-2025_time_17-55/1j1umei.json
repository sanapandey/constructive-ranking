    "selftext": "Democrat and New York City Mayor Eric Adams was investigating and indicted on major corruption charges last year. There is credible evidence of impropriety between Adams and foreign governments and officials (primarily from the Middle East, namely T\u00fcrkiye), where Adams allegedly took foreign money and committed wire fraud. The investigation led to a slew of resignations and another indictment of Adams\u2019 top advisor. It certainly seemed like a cut and dry case of corruption on the part of a democrat. \n\nThen Adams meets several times behind closed doors with Trump, and Trump\u2019s AG orders the charges dropped (without prejudice, meaning he can be charged again). In the wake of this, *seven* prosecutors have resigned in protest\u2014most of whom were republicans and most of whom support Trump, which I only mention to highlight that the opposition to this is not politically motivated. \n\nThe following article details the events more thoroughly: https://www.nytimes.com/article/eric-adams-indictment-timeline.html \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this situation? Should we ever not investigate legitimate concerns of corruption, particularly when foreign influence is a factor? \n\nHow do you reconcile these events with Trump\u2019s pledge to drain the swamp?",

Let's take of of the OP's examples and focus on that so we don't get distracted.\n\nThere is - right now - evidence in the public record that the Trump campaign lied and cheated in trying to win several swing states in 2020. Instead of trying to show the world the evidence is not what it appears to be, Trump instead tried to delay the proceedings as long as possible, then complained that the trial was interfering with his choice to run for president. His campaign attorneys illegally accessed the hardware and software of voting machines, and then tried to lie about it after the fact. Can you clarify if you're aware of these facts?",

If Trump pushed the DOJ to investigate her for any crime under the sun, that would be much closer to what Letita James did, and that would pose the same issues.\n\nIf Trump ordered the DOJ to investigate her email issue, which was already public information, then thats much less of an issue.\n\nAlso as a bonus point, Lock her up was a small part of his campaign, Letita made investigating Trump the central point of hers.",
