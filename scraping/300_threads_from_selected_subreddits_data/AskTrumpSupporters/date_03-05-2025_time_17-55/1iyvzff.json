However, what they are claiming does not match the receipts they are showing. \n\nAs of Feb 24th, they claimed $55 billion has been saved, but a deep dive one team did found the number is closer to $7 billion assuming 100% accuracy in DOGE's receipts: https://thepreamble.com/p/has-doge-actually-cut-55-billion\n\nDOGE website: https://doge.gov/savings\n\nAdditional source on receipts not matching claims, article is from Feb 26th: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doge-wall-of-receipts-more-discrepancies/\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these discrepancies?",

It's just like how they all act surprised the Elon is not a DOGE employee, even though that was clear all along. Now they act surprised when a contract identified by DOGE as wasteful isn't eliminated the same day it's identified - totally ignoring how the process actually works. When there is a wasteful contract that can't simply be removed, it won't be renewed for next year. That is still the listed savings amount. The linked article snarkily says\n\n>you can\u2019t save money on contracts that weren\u2019t canceled or that we are legally obligated to pay.\n\nYes you can. Yes, yes, yes you can. \n\nThe next example is even more blatant. A $99 million dollar contract is canceled. It is already obligated to pay out $37 million. DOGE lists this as a $62 million savings. Again with the snark, the article says,\n\n>The math does not math.\n\nBut, we can see that $99 million allocated - 37m obligated = 62m saved... exactly what DOGE claimed. Apparently the author thinks readers are too lazy to do two-digit math themselves, and will just trust his conclusions instead. \n\nDOGE can't win with mainstream media, that's why they go direct to the people.",

Legally obligated funds cannot simply be canceled - besides the fact that contracts have termination clauses, if you were under contract for $37 million worth of work and the government decided it was just going to stop paying, would you not take every legal remedy to ensure that the goods or work you were legally contracted to provide was paid for in full?\n\nAre you expecting the government to suddenly stop paying for millions in goods and services they legally obligated money to in order to match DOGE's savings claims?  Do you realize the impact that would have on the economy across the entire US?

It's disingenuous to claim that list is supposed to add up to the $55B, when it's supposed to come from far more than contracts.  \n\nThis behavior has become pretty standard for the media.   Demand more transparency.  When you get any, ignore what's actually said, lie to your readers that something else has been said.   Then argue against that.  \n\nThis is why the media is dead.

Regardless if Trump has the power to do so or not, shouldn't they make sure what they are working to shut down is properly accounted for before making such grand claims of savings?  I don't even have confidence they are being mindful of what they are even shutting down, considering they accidentally fired nuclear stockpile monitors and ebola prevention, do you?",
