So if he was cleared to be on grounds already, and to be in the general press areas, just like say, AP is (another hostile organization, not on the list to go into The Oval), then this is just a matter of them being supposed to stay in the bigger press areas but they tried to push it and sneak directly into The Oval. Something AP could do too, and would rightly get escorted out.\n\nSo no, it's not acceptable if orgs like AP, or TASS, abuse their general access privileges to sneak into The Oval without invitation.",

This could be a phenomena of a far left view, mistaking the center for \"far right.\" A very common thing the past decades where-in Trump:\n\n- a post-boy for 1960s Sexual Revolution play boy lifestyle\n- big fan of empowering women, gays, non-Christians, Democrats to top positions in his businesses and in politics \n- huge fan of MLK and Civil Rights believer\n- huge anti-war voice\n- supporter of Three-Branch model of government\n- known gay marriage supporter\n- left of Europe on Abortion\n- Big time Free Speech supporter\n- All around generally some sort of Libertarian-Liberal approach to most things\n- Mostly focused on individual State power and decisions during both a year of Covid and a year of National rioting\n- Barely distinguishable from 1990s Bill Clinton on many things including reducing government, technology and immigration\n\n... is some how supposedly \"far right.\" It's lunacy and totally distorted sense of the political spectrum to conclude the man and his administration is \"far right.\"  And yet, so many voices think Trump is \"far right\" and so too Fox.\n\nIt's just not honest, striving, sincere, nor objective thinking. For many, actual rightwing thinking isn't even on their map. Much more their spectrum. So anything right of far left is \"extreme\" to them.",

It's a leftwing worldview and Trump has long been the veritable post-boy for that NYC playboy lifestyle. It's leftwing. Count 1.\n \n>> huge fan of MLK and Civil Rights believer\n \n> Trump has repeatedly tried to claim he is more influential than MLK and held bigger crowds. Do you not think this is disrespectful and akin to almost desecration of an idol?\n\nSo what. He also widely glorifies him, literally built a statue to him, and lauds him and Civil Rights idealism as good. It's leftwing. Count 2.\n \n> He was sued for discriminatory rental practices against black people.\n\nDemocrat twist and talking point about some off-hand thing from 30 years ago with no proof Trump had some personal rule or involvement as a statement against black Americans. Totally irrelevant campaign spin that does not disprove my point whatsoever.\n \n>> huge anti-war voice\n\n> He is threatening to invade Canada, Greenland and Panama. \n\nFalse, false, and more false. He's never promoted war against Canada, Greenland, nor Panama. No need to spread falsehoods. He's literally the most anti-War leader on the World stage right now, and his record is one of wars reducing, not expanding, during his terms. Count 3.\n\n> He is also trying to blackmail Ukraine into giving up its earth minerals instead exchange for military support instead of the morally correct choice of providing the support\n\nUSA gives hundreds of $billions and the President seeks accountability toward his own people to get some sort of fair return, and your words abuse English (as if your country has an excuse for doing so) by calling it \"blackmail.\" Also, don't tell me what's \"moral\" to do with my country's money. It's my country. Not yours.\n\n>> supporter of Three-Branch model of government\n\n> He and his advisors (I believe republicans accept this is Musk\u2019s role) believe that the courts are tyrannical and \u201ccrooked\u201d.\n\nHe has advisors that believe the Executive Branch should be ruled by The Executive. And not be subservient to a thousand low court activist political operative judges. Wow, so shocking. /s He's not advocating for abolishing the other two branches of the Supreme Court and Congress/Senate. In fact, he supports that model. That's leftwing. Count 4.\n\n>> left of Europe on Abortion\n\n> Europe is a big place filled with different countries. Which country do you mean? The UK for example is more relaxed about abortion that the US. Italy is not.\n\nAdd them up and divide by the number of them to get an average. Trump pushed the Republicans left on abortion. Moving it to a state matter. And if you listen to him, it's obvious he just doesn't hold anywhere near rightist beliefs. He's left on abortion. Count 5.\n\n>> Big time Free Speech supporter\n\n> Is he? He seems to expressly dislike any speech which isn\u2019t a direct compliment to him.\n\nHe's literally going balls to the wall against Europe right now calling them all out on their wanna-be China Police State against free speech. He unleashed his VP to say it to Europe's faces, then called out Brit-Boy to his face just this week by cornering him in the Oval Office on it. It's a primary plank of his platform and alliance with Big Tech and MAGA body politic.\n\nFurthermore, freedom of speech is not freedom from the other person using his back. Trump loves the fight that comes from free speech. Count 6.\n\n>> Mostly focused on State power and decisions during both a year of Covid and a year of National rioting\n \n> Seems like it\u2019s states rights for some things and not others? He recently intervened to block NYC congestion pricing implementation. Whether you agree the policy is right or wrong, NY as a state implemented it.\n\nPiddly matters versus when it matters in big things. The latter defines. Trump de-centralizes powers under big emergency scenarios, instead of seizing them. \n \n>> Barely distinguishable from 1990s Bill Clinton on many things including reducing government, technology and immigration\n\n> When did Clinton fire entire departments of government?\n\nClinton literally cut 400,000 federal personnel and had his own DOGE type thing called REGO. \n\n> I think you\u2019re being quite dishonest here. \n\nThink that then. \n\n>Trump is quite clearly right to far right by most spectrums of political ideology. Almost no one who isn\u2019t a republican would even remotely consider him centrist. It\u2019s even evident by the leaders he praises such as Kim Jong Un, Putin, Netanyahu.\n\nWest Europe is so far left, so childish and petulant after decades of the USA under-writing their nanny states, that they've lost all perspective of real politics and the political spectrum. They think the entire political spectrum is defined by what happens between the bounds of Ireland and Italy circa 2025. The arrogant solipsism is astounding. I thought scientific thinking was birthed there, but apparently they've lost the ability to think empirically about anything at all.",

They can serve that audience from outside the oval office. They chose that.\n\n>Why do you view it as a \"protest\" against the administration?\n\nBecuase they deliberately did it?

CBC and BBC both use \"Gulf of America\" only in context of the US decision, not as their identifier. They're quite clear in that respect. AP does the same; their style guide explicitly states \"The Associated Press will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen\". That same guide also explains their rationale for keeping \"Mexico\" (international waters) versus \"Mount McKinley\" (exclusively US territory). Does this change your perspective?",

If you Google \"The Associated Press...Trump has chosen\" (the sentence I quoted) you get the AP's announcement entitled \"[AP style guidance on Gulf of Mexico, Mount McKinley](https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/announcements/ap-style-guidance-on-gulf-of-mexico-mount-mckinley/)\". Quoting that document:\n\n> **President Donald Trump** has signed an **executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America**. The body of water has shared borders between the U.S. and Mexico. **Trump\u2019s order only carries authority within the United States**. Mexico, as well as other countries and international bodies, do not have to recognize the name change.\n> \n> The Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years. **The Associated Press will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen**. As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences. \n> \n> The AP regularly reviews its style guidance regarding name changes, in part to ensure its guidance reflects common usage. We\u2019ll continue to apply that approach to this guidance and make updates as needed.\n\nThere's more, but this is the relevant part for the Gulf; I've highlighted portions in bold for clarity. The AP's announcement does use \"President Trump\" *in the first sentence*. It indicates that the change comes from an executive order, and they explain how he has the authority to do that in the United States. As for your concern about \"Trump\", that is also fully consistent with the style guide, which states \"The second time you refer to the titled person (and going forward), **refer to the individual by their last name only**\". That applies to presidents, prime ministers, and all other titled positions.\n\nAP's approach to the Gulf is consistent with the BBC, CBC and other news organizations. The BBC's article leads with \"Google Maps has blocked reviews for the Gulf of Mexico, after criticism of its decision to label it \"Gulf of America\" for users in the US\". CBC uses \"America\" in the article title because it is referencing the practice of using different names, not as a reference to the Gulf itself.",

In a hypothetical scenario, do you think Neville Chamberlain (western leaders) would concede Czechoslovakia (Ukraine) to Germany (Russia) if prior to that the Czechoslovaks (Ukrainians) pushed the German (Russian) army back from the gates of Prague (Kyiv) and then bogged them down in a bloody attritional war in the Sudetenland (eastern Ukraine)?",
