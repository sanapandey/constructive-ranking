So if you have a passport and a driver's licence with different names or differently spelled names, you can't vote. (Or if you bring a gas bill to prove your residence, etc.) \n\nBut of course, when women marry, the process of changing your name is both expensive and time consuming. So there are a ton of women who have their married name on their driver's licence, because that's cheap and easy, but not their passport, because it's expensive and they rarely or never leave the country.\n\nI'll also just note that when someone immigrates or is the child of immigrants, their original name may be spelled in a different script- for example, Chinese characters, Hebrew or Arabic letters. Transliteration isn't always perfect, so I have a friend (who is an American citizen) named Winnie who equally spells it Winne, because that's how her family's always spelt it and she really doesn't care. I've also known immigrants who spelled their child's transliterated name differently in exactly the same way. For example, Mei/May or Lin/Lynn. (Heck, my own Nana had a nickname that she spelt multiple different ways.)\n\nSo tightening this up could be a real issue for all of these people. It seems silly not to just use unique voting identifiers like social security numbers. What do you think?",

The pieces were already in place thanks to Obama, so Biden\u2019s administration didn\u2019t need to do shit. They could just sit back, poor a whisky, light a cigar, and watch the West burn.\n\nTrump\u2019s mission is to undo all of the Leftist garbage of the past decade, hence his no-nonsense approach to getting shit done. This has been *long* overdue, so Trump\u2019s administration isn\u2019t wasting any time in fixing America.",

Common mistake for progressives who both hate Christianity and deeply believe that Jesus Christ was a 21st century western liberal progressive. Did Jesus chastise himself for not feeding the money changers that he whipped at the temple. Did he not routinely send sinners away from him. Did he not distinguish between the religious and the political without diminishing the correctness of political rule? You have to think a bit more deeply about things than just cherry picking something that you think sounds vaguely liberal\n\nYour argument is that your cursory review of cherry picked scripture fed to you by people who hate Christians to justify your own worldview makes for better theology than that of Aquinas and a long line of church fathers.",

Do you believe you have a political duty to take personal pleasure from the misfortune of illegal immigrants?\n\nJesus didn\u2019t judge people based on how well they fulfilled local laws. The merchants at the temple weren\u2019t chastised because they weren\u2019t following local laws. They were chastised because they were making the same mistake you are now, focusing more on your wealth and wellbeing in this life instead of on our duty to our fellow man and to God so that we can enter his kingdom in the next.\n\nDo you also believe in prosperity gospel nonsense?",

Not trying to be evasive, I just find it tedious. You have incredulity that someone could believe the things that basically every Christian believed until your grandparents' lifetimes and potentially even more recent than that.\n\nFrom my perspective, you're saying \"you don't agree with 1960s radicals on race and immigration? how do you reconcile that with views that predate them?\". Easily! There's literally nothing to reconcile. I just think liberals are wrong!\n\n> What should happen to Americans who don't follow your strict guidelines for acceptable American citizens?\n\nWe can start by shutting off immigration, deporting the people here illegally, and bringing back freedom of association.",

If you want a thorough answer based in scripture, I'm sure you can find one if you look, but I personally don't find it to be an interesting conversation because I've seen how it always goes. This is getting kind of repetitive already. \n\nDo you genuinely think America just completely dropped the ball and we didn't have any real Christians until at least the 20th century? For me that proposition is ludicrous so there is no point even entertaining it.\n\n> Furthermore, if white christians wanted to immigrate to america would you be ok with that?\n\nIt would be odd for me to embrace a principle whose acceptance would make the country impossible to found in the first place. But I don't think that we should have open borders even for White Christians. Ideally, it would be low in quantity and high in quality (not massive numbers of unskilled workers, even if they are a demographic fit).",

What the illegal immigrants are doing isn't 'bad' per se, it's just that they're not following the law.  I don't think that should be sufficient cause for these people to be treated the way they currently are.  It's possible to enforce the law without dehumanizing the very people that are being arrested and deported.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the current situation in general regarding deportations?  Are you satisfied with the way things are currently going or would you prefer to see further actions being taken by this administration?",
