    "selftext": "Fuck you Mr. Smith. \r\n\r\nI was a fan. Your entrance into the \u201cIndie\u201d scene was as eloquent as it was brief. With the sale of \u201cClerks\u201d you were truly no longer an \u201cIndependent\u201d film maker. This was not a shortcoming in my opinion.\r\n\r\nDialogue being at the heart of every flick, there always being a glimmer of your own heart in the process, it kept me coming back for each successive \u201cSmith Flick\u201d. \r\n\r\nYou were the \u201cClerks\u201d guy! \u201cSilent Bob\u201d! You were approachable, you appreciated your audience and unlike so many other characters in Hollywood, you did not speak through a publicist, it became a perpetual flood from your mouth to the worlds\u2019 eyes and ears. \r\n\r\nThroughout my enjoyment as a Fan, on thing always carried well in my mind, if I were so motivated, I could make a film. \r\n\r\nYou presented that fact at what seemed every opportunity, if someone wanted to be a filmmaker, a writer, a director; they need only decided they WERE such a thing. \r\n\r\nThis brings me to my viewing of \u201cRed State\u201d, a flick that can be classified as nothing less than a true independent film. I had some expectations; there had been some buzz, so I believed I was in for a different kind of \u201cKevin Smith\u201d film. This is what was promised, except that was not what was delivered. \r\n\r\nWhat was delivered was something else entirely. The story unfolds at first in a very device like fashion and a little bit of clunky exposition to allow for the main elements to be outlined. The first ten minutes read like a beginners guide to filmmaking checklist. \r\n\r\nYou know where the flick is headed and with this genres tank coming up on empty, there is just nothing new to offer. \r\n\r\nUntil about fifteen minutes in, then much like the feeling you get when a small child falls from a piece of playground equipment, the world slows a little and things become very, very surreal. \r\n\r\nMoments ago you were reading your book, looking up and giving a smile, now you are locked in you seat, watching, powerlessly as the world folds in on itself. \r\n\r\n\u201cRed State\u201d does break traditional rules of filmmaking, it simply ignores them. It sidesteps perception, it takes a meandering trip through moral implications, right and wrong, good and bad and leaves you breathless, spent and wondering what the hell just happened. \r\n\r\nMichael Parks gives a powerful performance, a performance that burrows its way into your skull and refuses to leave. John Goodman is the everyman, and brings nothing but grace and gravitas to his own role. \r\n\r\nThere was such honesty and subtlety to each character, every cast member took their moment of film, and owned it.  \r\n\r\nIn the end the truly horrifying thing about this little tale, is how possible it really is.   \r\n\r\nSo, until this moment Mr. Smith, I have always felt like I could be a filmmaker. That dream, is now fractured. \r\n\r\nWhat I experienced was a shocking reminder that as the credits rolled, it clearly said \"Written and Directed by Kevin Smith\" and until that moment, since my world began being twisted this way and that, I had forgotten. \r\n\r\nThere will be many to say this film \u201cRedefines\u201d Kevin Smith, personally I think that we have all been \u201cDefining\u201d him wrong to begin with. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
