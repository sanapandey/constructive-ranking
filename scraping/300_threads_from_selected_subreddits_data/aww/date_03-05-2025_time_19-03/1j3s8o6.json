A lot of cat HATE that and will send you to the hospital (I have scars).\n\nTry petting her from the other direction, not by reaching over her stomach and face. A lot of animals get headshy because of people or animals attacking them from the front. Try petting her cheeks and the top of her head.\n\nFor more interesting information about how to have a great relationship with your cat, try watching jackson galaxy on youtube or his show My Cat From Hell on animal planet. He's a cat behaviorist and i've learned SO MUCH from him.",
