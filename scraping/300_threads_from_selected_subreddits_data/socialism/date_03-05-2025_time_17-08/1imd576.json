    "selftext": "With China creating Deep Seek they have thrown a serious wrench in the US AI market. There is no way for Open AI to compete with with a free open source AI that was significant ly cheaper to make. This isn't me saying AI is good or bad but what this shows is a market for Chinese tech. \n\nUS tech has become increasingly hostile to consumers lately. It has been frustrating to see features that were once a given for tech get taken away and resold to us, often as a subscription. For China there is a huge incentive to release tech that is consumer friendly and cheaper then US tech. I think this could be a serious control to our tech oligarchs control over the world.\n\n I don't think this would make Elon Musk broke  but it will be very hard for companies whose goals are to maximize profit to compete with China's goals of efficiency. I know this isn't revolution in a classic sense but if that does happen will this be an opportunity to take power while the oligarchs are licking their wounds? Will unionization be much easier in this time or will we get cracked down by our god emperors? ",

It's the same ploy, just a different color on the package.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, it's a dotcom style grift, as with a lot of US tech today. China releasing deepseek won't affect that aspect. The US gov't is going to let Musk & the oligarchs drain it's coffers & the working class regardless. The $500B gov't AI fund has been pushed since way before the election.\n\nDeepseek shows a lot of the cracks in US tech & that US hegemony here isn't unbeatable. It creates lots of opportunities outside of the US. Within the US, it's causing a tripling down around this space. Especially investors.\n\nWill that cause more USA workers to start to gain class consciousness? IDK. In my lifetime we've seen an endless march of market booms, then bust, then massive government bailouts. Each time legislation moved to not prevent the busts but just institutionalize the losses. This stabilized markets at the expense of the working class. Further alienated the market economy from the average working class person's economic experience. \n\nThis cycle is obvious to all but few actually accept this is the only way capitalism can work. \n\nInside the USA, China's success creates a cold war style antagonist, which has always been an easy & highly effective tool for blocking class consciousness here. The USA seems to be going that way again. Manipulators are always going to manipulate.\n\nAll we can do is have the difficult conversations, talk about what everyone sees happening & very few Americans are emotionally capable of acknowledging. Things are going to get worse for the majority of the working class. This will drive people further left or further right but reactionary leftism is real. We need to focus on creating class consciousness for those pushed our way while we have this opportunity.",

            "body": "At this point in time China has no intention of helping leftists \"movements\" in the United States or elsewhere. China is building socialism in its own country but it's not interested in exporting political revolution. Their main foreign policy is fostering global development and cooperation through trade. In Xi Jinping's Governance of China Xi says the Belt and Road and other initiatives will eventually bring about a new international order as countries in the global south becoming relatively stronger compared to the imperialist powers. What this new order will look like and whether it will lead to an increased socialist presence around the globe is difficult to say. Xi is also vague about this in *Governance*. \n\nChina has directly supported leftist and leftish governments through aid but the current party position is to not back any movements that topple governments because they view this as a form of social imperialism. However, I believe the US is on a collision course with China, though this isn't a sure thing and it's just my opinion. I think the US will becoming increasingly belligerent towards China and may do something brazen like assassinate top party officials, become more bold in their attempts to foment unrest, and send more troops to the pacific. If this happens China may strike back and support leftist movements in the US, or at least movements that destabilize the country and weaken the US's capacity to undermine China. \n\nAs for your question about AI specifically I do not think so. I think AI is a bubble and that bubble was inevitably going to burst. AI has its uses but it's not going to totally change the world like its proponents often argue. Deepseek just provided some hard evidence that it's overblown and Sam Altman and company are taking his investors for a ride.",

From my personal experience, most leftists in the Western Hemisphere are knowledgeable about the Soviet Era but usually have very little clue about anything Chinese-related, usually espousing whatever anti-Chinese sentiment is popular at the time. \n\nYou can see the root of the problem from how many people have an encyclopedic knowledge of Roman history and events on English-speaking websites. However, when you offer Chinese history, which has a similar depth of complexity, organization, and strife, there are just crickets all around and quotations from the same few articles from the early to mid-1900s that uphold current anti-Chinese propaganda. So the issue isn't the volumes of fascinating history, the reading part, the wars, or the organization. Hmm, what is the difference?\n\nAs an ethnically Chinese man who was born in Hong Kong with one side of my family from Taiwan, my experience in Western countries (degree in Sociology, among others) has been an eerily lack of any curiosity, much less bare minimal effort or work put into seeking out cultures or things outside of the Western world for the vast majority of my peers. \n\nThe amount of disdain I've gotten from just saying I'm Chinese from both Americans and American-born Chinese individuals in the West has been staggeringly overwhelming into weird ethnic purity dick-measuring contests heavily insinuating that I'm not \"not Asian enough\" to actually know, unlike them despite being born and growing up in East Asia. It feels like I'm living in a bizarro world.\n\nNo one I've talked to in the past decade in the US would even believe me when I said that Chinese cities were much more technologically advanced and had high mutual trust that some people finally saw with the recent exodus to Chinese social media. Instead, much more prefers to blanket label an entire culture as some weird Dances with Wolves-esq, \"Honor Obsessed Savage.\"",

From [Terms of Admission into Communist International](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/jul/x01.htm), as adopted by the First Congress of the Communist International:\n\n>18 - In view of the foregoing, parties wishing to join the Communist International must change their name. Any party seeking affiliation must call itself the Communist Party of the country in question (Section of the Third, Communist International). The question of a party\u2019s name is not merely a formality, but a matter of major political importance. The Communist International has declared a resolute war on the bourgeois world and all yellow Social-Democratic parties. The difference between the Communist parties and the old and official \u201cSocial-Democratic\u201d, or \u201csocialist\u201d, parties, which have betrayed the banner of the working class, must be made absolutely clear to every rank-and-file worker. \n\nSimilarly, the adoption of a wrong name to refer to the CPC consists of a double edged sword: on the one hand, it seeks to reduce the ideological basis behind the party's name to a more ethno-centric view of said organization and, on the other hand, it seeks to assert authority over it by attempting to externally draw the conditions and parameters on which it provides the CPC recognition.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
