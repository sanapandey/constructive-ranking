I think that anarchism is widely misunderstood by many of its critics, even in the broader socialist movement. From my years of being an anarchist, I have noticed that many of the critiques of the philosophy from people outside of it are lacklustre. The main reason being that they often don't come from a place of constructive good-faith critique, but instead with the intent on discrediting anarchism and pushing further into the margins. A lot of the arguments against anarchism (especially from Marxists) rely on whatever clich\u00e9s and talking points stem from what Marxist theoreticians (like Engels, Lenin, Trotsky, etc.) have said about the anarchists of their time, a lot of which are useless and don't adequately address anarchist ideas.",

                    "body": "That's because a lot of anarchists (and marxists) have a base level appeal to classical anarchism and Marxism. They become attracted to anti capitalist or anti authortarian slogans but never delve deeper.  How many young anarchists will quote bakunin but ask who's that when talking about Lorenzo Kom\u2019boa? Anarchism in America, if not for black anarchists and PoC would be nothing more than a white social club using the imagery and slogans of historic anarchism whilst being disconnected from the class struggle they took part in. The only reason American anarchists began to get their shit together as a movement was the black organizers critiquing their praxis and theory",
