    "selftext": "Inspired by this post -> https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/s/gE7EameVwY\n\nRegardless of which varient of socialism you support, I think we can all agree that Trump and the Republican Party are antithetical to our ideals. As such, I believe our top priority as socialists and members of the broader left should be to oppose them however we can. The following is some ideas I have to go about this. Please give constructive feedback and any other ideas you may have.\n\n1. Get involved.\n\nFind a local org and join it. I don't care which, personally I'm a fan of DSA, Working Families Party, and Food Not Bombs, but to each their own. Stay in the loop of meetings and actions. Participate in as many as you can. Try to make friends in these as well. Not just for political reasons, but it's good to have friends. Also, try to organize your workplace if you don't already have a union. Here is a link for assistance -> https://workerorganizing.org/support/ . Also check out r/union if you have any additional questions about this. They're very helpful. If someone here has experience with workplace organizing I'd love to hear what you have to say.\n\n2. Solidarity.\n\nLet's not bicker amongst each other about theory specifics during this time please. It feels like arguing about what colors the walls should be painted while the house is on fire. Instead we should show support for other orgs, spreading information on their actions as much as possible. Additionally, we should show support for unions and other organizations as much as possible. Show up to their demonstrations; find links to support funds, donate what you can, and spread them as much as possible; even doing something as small as giving people demonstrating food or other basic supplies helps.\n\n3. Advocate.\n\nNot just in official demonstrations but to whoever you feel would be receptive. Obviously not everyone is going to be receptive, in which case this probably isn't worth the time unless you enjoy arguing. Try to be as respectful and patient as possible. So long as someone is willing to consider that \"Orange Man bad\" and something ought to be done about it, I think this is good enough for our current situation. We can cross other bridges when we get there.\n\n4. Keep up with the news.\n\nEspecially your local news. I'll admit I'm not always great on this and I need to improve, but I think it's important to be aware of the goings on in your area and how the administration is handling it. Also people are just naturally more concerned with what's happening around them than what's happening on the other side of the country or the world. We have to make sure people know how they personally are getting screwed.\n\n5. Vote.\n\nI know this might turn some people off here, but hear me out. There are some people in Democratic primaries who are more sympathetic to our goals than others. I think they should be supported. Additionally, depending on where you live there are ballot initiatives either in motion to be on the ballot or are being petitioned to be on the ballot. I think these should be looked at and supported. After all, ballot initiatives seem to do better at advancing working class interests than politicians. For instance, in the last election Missouri not only voted to secure abortion rights in their constitution, but also passed a measure that would increase the minimum wage to $15/hr and require paid sick leave for many businesses. I agree with most of the criticisms of our electoral process, but it's nonetheless something we ought to be involved in.\n\nAlright I'll end it here. Would like to hear other thoughts, suggestions, and things we're doing.",
