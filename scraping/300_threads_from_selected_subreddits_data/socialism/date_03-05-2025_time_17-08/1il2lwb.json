    "selftext": "I recently finished Blackshirts and Reds, as my first peice of Socialist literature - it was fantastic, definitely a book I'd recommend. But in one of his chapters, 'Communism in Wonderland' Michael Parenti brings up very valid critiscisms and issues with economics in existing/existed Socialist countries, such as Rewarding inefficiency, 'minding the store', etc. - I'm interested in a book that can explain socialist economic methods and policies which circumvent past issues within these economies.\n\nAnd, though I haven't read it, I'm pretty sure Capital won't answer my questions, as I'm pretty sure its an more an analysis of Capitalism + it has no/very few communist examples to base itself off of.",
