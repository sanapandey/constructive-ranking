            "body": "Turkish backed groups was not only backed by Turkey, they were created by the US to begin with, and Kurds shouldn't have got too comfortable with the US support, it was very obvious they were gonna be dropped soon or later. US utilized them and their mission is over now. \n\nPlus those turkish backed radical islamists now run Syria anyway which means SDF doesn't have any chance integrating without sacrificing it's freedom.\n\nDespite this obvious ending, YPG was very comfortable with US aid and they were Pro Israel throughout the war which made them arrogant to the point that they refused to sit down and talk qith Assad many times. More and more reasons to pity this movement. It shouldn't have ended like this. Such great potential to fade away because of wrong choices.",
