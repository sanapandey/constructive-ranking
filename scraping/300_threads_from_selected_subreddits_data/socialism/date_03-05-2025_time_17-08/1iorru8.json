    "selftext": "I\u2019ve thought this for a while and pls give me a chance to explain. Just to start I\u2019m NOT a crypto bro by any means.\n\nFor several reasons it feels some leftists take an anti-tech stance. Nuclear power is a big example where even though it is a finite resource that creates waste, the payout is more than worth it. At the same time we 100% should make our foundation sustainable energy. \n\nUnder capitalism I can agree there is lots of pointless \u201cinnovation\u201d that exists purely to be sold and make profit. Such as a million different phones, and pointless gadgets. Capitalism also perverts lots of technology and uses it to exploit people such as social media and surveillance.\n\nAt the same time it\u2019s really confusing seeing how anti-AI many leftists are. I can understand the argument that it consumes lots of energy doing things humans can do themselves and that search engines are already capable of. My response to that is that the cost to run these models significantly drops over time. These models are not forever expensive to run. We\u2019re already seeing the cost to run them drop significantly as they are open sourced and refined. Plus the payoff is 100% worth the cost even now. Millions around the world have already benefited from its existence, and use it daily. While they are wrong about lots of things sometimes this is the very first iphone version. As they perfect the technology the cost goes down and its ability, skill, and knowledge goes up. Were already seeing them rapidly become the best programmers on earth.\n\nAnother argument thats made is that AI art steals from artists which makes no sense at all to me. All art is inspired by other art thats kinda the whole point. Humans \u201csteal\u201d and build on each others art all the time and theres no issue when a human does it. Art is similar to science where people release their work for others to use and build on. Considering leftists are anti private property I would expect us to also be anti intellectual property. You can\u2019t own an idea, technology, or art. The second you release it you forfeit any money you would\u2019ve made selling it. What artists should really be upset about is the fact they depend on making art for survival because of capitalism which brings me to my next point.\n\nAnother argument is that they will cause mass layoffs which is the meat of my argument. For one we have to ask why is that a bad thing? The only reason mass layoffs are bad is because under capitalism people depend on their job to survive. Without a job you starve, but thats not a technology issue thats a political issue. If something can do a job for cheaper and more efficiently theres no reason not to use it. Under socialism this technology would free people to focus on other important things than working a job. But under capitalism its used to save money on labor and further increase profit. The same argument goes for artists, AI doesn\u2019t prevent a single artist from creating art, the logic of capitalism does. AI art enables millions of people without skills to also create their own vision. And again the quality of the art is beside the point because these are the very first versions and they will rapidly improve. I literally just saw an 11 minute fully AI generated star wars film, this was physically impossible just last year. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the majority of media in the future is ai generated.\n\nBut even bigger than that this was always the inevitable outcome of technology, it all started when we made the first tool that freed time for others things. From rocks, to tools, to factories, to robots, to ai. We naturally create things to do the things we dont want to do. What these AI companies are attempting to create is a fully digital worker. A fully digital worker can be scaled up infinitely, your only restraint is physical compute. An army of digital workers can be tasked with anything, automated research, automated labor, use your imagination. A socialist implementation of these technologies could revolutionize the world. If we had an entirely automated economy we could meet everyones needs globally for little cost. We could guarantee everyone a high standard of living. We could fully separate work from access to resources because the AI handles it all.\n\nNow how AI will accelerate the transition to socialism imo is this. We will start seeing mass layoffs in the near future due to AI and robotics, no one can deny it atp. When that happens most people will be moving towards poverty as they spend their last dollars trying to survive. Many people will fight over the last remaining jobs, and resentment will start to build. Once billionaires fully employ AI and robots, and while the majority of the population is unemployed, people won\u2019t just sit and starve. Liberals are already advocating for UBI and similar programs but we as socialists have to take it one step further. Getting handouts from billionaires isnt enough, we have to seize the robots and AI for ourselves. Only then can we have true freedom and liberation. I believe the contradictions of capitalism would be too blatant to ignore. People will see themselves and their families hungry, while the rich profit off AI. The argument that they worked hard for it would no longer be realistic because AI does all the work. Once people have no other choice besides revolution to feed their families thats what will happen.\n\nTLDR: Robots and AI will lead to mass unemployment, with a massively unemploymed population people will have no other choice but to seize the means of production for themselves. Liberals are already advocating for halfway socialism with UBI and similar programs because people will have no other way to feed themselves, but we have to take it further.",

            "body": "Ok the problem with this is capitalism does not work this way. Capitalism extracts all profit from the unpaid labor of its workers. If you get rid of all the workers you get rid of all of the profit. People in the past thought we would have automated everything already, and we could have if we weren't under capitalism.\n\nThink about it this way. With every thing you automate you reduce the wages of the workers. So at a certain point the reduced wages of the workers will be lower than the cost to automate more. The capitalist will stop automating at this point because they just want the most return on their investment.\n\nThis is why socialism is better. Socialism cares about the labor hours required to make a good, not the profit you get for doing it. This means automation would always be chosen, as automation always reduces the amount of labor hours to do something. We will only manage to truly automate everything under socialism/communism.",

At the same time capitalists are looking in the short term. If Im trying to make more money and I can pay less for more work every capitalist would make that decision unless humans are somehow cheaper than AI.\n\nThis would also mean because there are no consumers theres no production, even though we have all the tools to produce, further incentivizing political change imo.",

While a socialist society might abolish intellectual property in its current form, that doesn\u2019t mean artists shouldn\u2019t be recognized or compensated for their contributions under capitalism. The core problem is that artists, like all workers, are forced to commodify their labor to survive. AI doesn\u2019t liberate them under capitalism... it just threatens their already precarious existence.\n\nCapitalism has always found ways to adapt to technological advancements, often by forcing workers into new, even more exploitative forms of labor. We\u2019ve already seen how the gig economy was created as a response to automation and deindustrialization. AI won\u2019t automatically \u201cforce\u201d socialism...it will force a crisis, but whether that leads to socialism or a more repressive form of capitalism/fascism depends on class struggle.

But yes I agree artists should be compensated, I don\u2019t think that takes the form of intellectual property though. Under socialism work would be detached from pay, everyone would already be guaranteed a standard of living so using someones art should be no problem because it doesn\u2019t affect them at all. \n\nUnder capitalism all technology hurts workers, that doesn\u2019t make the technology bad it makes the system bad. I see lots of leftists directing their hate specifically at AI though.\n\nBut I do agree with your last point AI wont necessarily force socialism but it will create a crisis, possibly the biggest crisis and depression in all history. Personally I believe that capitalism is developing all the tools needed for communism, which will make communism undeniable in the future.

Trees can perceive their environment and make decisions, does that give them consciousness and subjective experience? We have no idea.

With AI this is no longer true. After AI is capable enough theres no more roles for workers to fill globally. That means possibly billions of people out of work.

The oligarchs of this country already have data on everyone, and with robots and AI they could weaponize that autonomously. We could reach a point where using AI they can make their class positions unchallengeable. I think the only 2 outcomes are automated surveillance capitalism, or communism.

Many of your arguments about AI were made, essentially identically, about previous advances in labor automation.\n\n\nYou see it all the time in the modern world with, for example, farming in the former third world, where imperial capitalists separate millions of farmers from their farms every year. Any organized oppositional activity the farmers engage in as a result is either ignored or brutally suppressed. Either way, nothing changes for the better for them. All that wealth stolen from the farmers, year after year until they are committing suicide in the hundreds of thousands, is used to research and implement new tools of oppression - more advanced weapons for cops and military, for example, or more pervasive and stealthy spyware to disrupt left organizing attempts.\n\n\nThe primary historical lesson here is this: Relying on technology to drive revolution is always a mistake. It is a tool, not a cause. That tool can be used by anyone, yes, but the more that tool is consolidated in the hands of an oppressor - as with current AI - the more dominant its use against rather than for revolution. And as a fallback, the empire always has good old-fashioned genocide to rely on. Some savvy socialist-built AI is no defense against indiscriminate bombing and gunfire.\n\n\nI hold a separate set of disagreements with your point about AI art but I'll put that in a reply to this comment because it is ontologically distinct.",

                    "body": "Regarding your point about AI art\u00a0being no different than human art because each builds on other human art, my disagreements are less about revolutionary material dialectics and more about a logical fallacy and what I call the principle of being an asshole.\n\nI'll discuss the logical fallacy first.\n\nHumans can and regularly do make art that stems from states of consciousness an AI (at least in the way they are currently created) fundamentally cannot replicate. These include (but are not limited to) dreams, near-death experiences, flow states, drugs, conscious construction of a new principle from the combination of known principles, and individual spontaneous bursts of determination and other inspirational feeling.\u00a0These kinds of mental phenomena are what put the oomph or spark in art: They are what make it so inspiring, subversive, repulsive, or whatever other strong resonance it achieves in us. They are the core of art as a form of emotional and spiritual communication between minds.\n\nNote that I don't mean \"spiritual\" in some denominational fashion; I'm an atheist, so please don't get hung up on this word. I'm also not limiting this concept to human minds. Apes, for example, make art that we find breathtaking, that grow our sense of the world even though a human child might do some specific technique \"better\" and merely get some smiles. We get this feeling because we are connecting to another mind, or to something deep within ourselves or far outside of ourselves that changes our perception about existence on an instinctive level.\n\nAI is not making those connections because it lacks any access to the phenomena I described. All it can do is mimic what is fed to it and generate statistical mashups. It is not a musician, it is a mixtape artist mashing other artists together without any purpose until it finds something that gets it more positive feedback. That is exactly how corporate \"art\" works and why people hate it. It's the crux of most artistic criticisms of, say, Netflix executive decisions. It's why \"focus grouped\" is an insult in art discussion. The AI is doing algorithmic focus grouping on a profoundly distilled and expanded level.\n\nThe other components of art, the ones that can be deliberately mimicked and which can be fed to an AI - individual plot points in a novel, say, or the structure of what constitutes \"good\" writing in a particular context - those things are constructive techniques, not motivating phenomena. It's the difference between a tech demo and a heartfelt videogame made with that tech. None of these techniques are, in themselves, art - at least not in the way that anyone means it when they get mad at AI creating art. No one's mad because an AI draws some white dots on a blue background, they're mad when that AI does this in van Gogh's style and then some asshole human says \"Look this AI made art\" or, even worse, \"Look I made art!\" No, you copied van Gogh. Rote plagiarism, however technically sophisticated, is different than communicative inspiration. It's a scientist doing original research compared to someone who sends you a million Wikipedia articles stapled together.\n\nHere's where we get to my second point, the principle of being an asshole.\n\nWhen an executive producer on a movie butchers a beautifully written script and says \"I funded this movie, I'm the reason it exists\" we might hate that executive for being a capitalist. If they did the same thing but said \"I *wrote* this movie, I'm the reason it exists\" we would still hate them for being a capitalist but we'd *also* hate them on sheer principle. Which principle? That they're obviously an asshole. I'm not sure how much analysis this really needs - it's a lie, it's cruel, it's superficial, it's a hundred other things that humans of any culture generally agree constitute assholery.\n\nAn AI is that executive but now they're superhuman. They're so much faster at reading and writing than every human writer that they're butchering *millions of scripts at a time.* Humans infused those original scripts with communicative meaning based on the mental states I mentioned earlier. They may have influenced each other in countless ways, but they were still communicating something about reality. The only thing this superhuman executive is communicating is: \"Look how well I focus group, I'm the same as all these writers, I'm an artist!\" Meanwhile they are drowning out all the artists who labored to communicate something and who, because of the AI, are directly blocked by sheer volume from one of the greatest natural rewards of art, which is *knowing that other people have received your inspired communication.*\n\nHope that helps you understand an alternate perspective.",

What I don\u2019t get is why AI isn\u2019t seen as just another tool\nin combination with the hundreds of other tools. Whether is specifically using the mushy AI style for artistic purposes, or generating a scene so you don\u2019t have to create it physically. AI art doesn\u2019t make itself, its still someones expression, your just stacking your specific expression on top of all the data its trained on. \n\nIm not saying people fully rely on AI for artistic expression Im just saying add it to the toolkit when needed. Like you said a child scribbling isnt considered art, art is the effort put into something. AI is just another medium for artistic expression the same way any other tool is. Most people who use AI tools aren\u2019t taking the raw output and calling it art, you take the generation, add sound effects, edit it, color grade it, and lots of other things. If art is defined as human effort put into creating something, the same applies to AI just in different ways and to a lesser degree. While prompting an AI is not in the same category as making a painting, the same can be said about 3d modeling, or sculpting, or any other form of art. AI is just another medium for human expression. Why should someone be required to go through years of art classes when they can get the same output using an AI? Sure you can call it more meaningful, but not everyone cares about meaning, some people just want to materialize their vision with the least effort needed.",

Automating the latter is generally viewed with much less antagonism than the former, as I already discussed, though it is often viewed with less respect.\n\nThink of James Patterson ghost writers following a standard template vs Ishiguro Kazuo writing wherever his fascinatingly weird heart takes him. The latter absolutely holds more artistic respect, tied in part to the way he pushes the tools themselves forward through sheer craft, but not everyone cares about that and it doesn't mean plenty of people don't enjoy the former author more. It's a matter of taste and desire.\n\nOr think of the minor uproar that happened when Ghibli first started using CGI to automat some aspects of their art. Those stylistic disagreements still exist, but generally not that many people care anymore. The tool issue has morphed into a style issue. If that's all you're using AI for, go nuts, just be prepared for that stylistic disagreement to persist forever from some quarters. This is an issue all artists face with their chosen tools.\n\nIt's when you start trying to automate the spark, the oomph - that is when people will instinctively take much stronger Issue. Try an AI mashup of the artistic *themes* from, say, Totoro and Kiki, and try to claim it is *equivalent* to those movies and that *you* \"made\" it, and you will receive a deep swell of hatred that goes much farther and deeper than stylistic disagreement, and that hatred isn't going away with the mere passage of time. Same with an AI mashup of Ishiguro and Patterson - hilarious as a meme, sure, but seriously claim it as your own equivalent work of art and that tone will change real fast.\n\nSo it sounds like maybe we're kinda on the same page.",

If AI causes a depression because no one has money to consume, the only thing left to eat is the rich. Once we reach that point revolution is the only answer.

Those hundreds of thousands of suiciding farmers *already had no money to consume.* The only thing left to them clearly was not to \"eat the rich\". Suicide under insurmountable conditions of subjugation was also left to them, and *that's what actually happened.* Revolution doesn't automatically occur just because a critical mass of people get mistreated to death. A history of genocides disproves this possibility. Those farmers weren't ignoring or failing to see blatant class contradictions - they saw them far more clearly than you or I, who are still alive and having this conversation in the abstract. This is literally what I meant when I said relying on technology to drive revolution is always a mistake.\n\n>But at the same time I think AI is fundamentally different from previous technologies.\n\nThis has been said many times about many technologies throughout history.\n\n>AI is the epitome of technology, theoretically it can replace the jobs of everyone and be scaled up infinitely.\n\nThis is wrong on several levels.\n\nFirst, no technology can be scaled up infinitely. The first and second laws of thermodynamics demonstrate this quite clearly. Entropy is the ultimate villain of much classic scifi for a very good reason. For your statement to be correct, you need to invent a new understanding of physics. Infinite scalability is not only universally destructive, it is one of the core flawed logics of capitalism.\n\nSecond, AI is not God. Neither existing forms of it, nor any possible theorized future version of it. Not even AIs based on quantum computing, or even a higher-dimensional holographic principle, is this universally purposable. All things must specialize. Evolution itself is a good natural clue to this. There is no \"best\" or \"perfect\" evolution, whether natural or artificial. Everything is a tradeoff.\n\nThird, if an AI *could* do everything, then it would actually be a god and suddenly we've moved from discussions of dialectical materialism applied to human economic models right back into fundamental theological questions about our relationship with a god or gods. This might be me going out on a limb here but I don't think that's the kind of change I nor any other communist is looking for.\n\nI do not mean to sound harsh, but I really suggest you read more history, physics, math, information theory, the nuts and bolts of neural networks, maybe biology, definitely socialist theory, and even some scifi (why not it's fun) before trying to push the ideas you've presented here.",
