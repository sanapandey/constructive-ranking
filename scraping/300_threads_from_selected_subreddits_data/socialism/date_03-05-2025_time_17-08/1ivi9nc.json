    "selftext": "With China becoming close to the hegemony, it could use this moment to culturally liberalise like USSR under Kruschev. \n\nThe West fears apps like Tik Tok because of it's potential as a spreading of Chinese culture. At the moment China seems to very much have a kind of trade deficit in regards to art in spite of it's massive economy and huge population base, very much due to state repression and hyperfocus on controlling narrative.\n\nYet the West is also in a massive state of cultural decline because of neoliberalism which has led to the homogenisation of art in the mainstream (and low quality art by the upper and middle class 'radicals')\n\nAs Mark Fisher outlined in his K Punk writings, British social democracy in the post-war period led to a flourishing of art because of state funding  for the arts. Working class cinema and music flourished in this time which gave rise to a lot of experimentation with genres like Post-Punk. \n\nGeorge Lucas correctly pointed out that in many ways experimental films were easier to get made in the more liberal USSR periods (as long as they did not criticise the state) compared to the Hollywood system. If China did something similar it could create a revolution in art, and that pluralism could lead to a revival of social democracy in the West to counter it (but also violent reactionaryism is likely too considering the state of things in the US)\n\nAt the moment too there is growing pressure in China because of mass unemployment of graduates who are unable to find work leading to a lot of frustration too because of the intense study and high work culture that is affecting it's domestic stability. Artistic liberalisation could provide people with outlets as well as a kind of pressure valve for this kind of unrest.\n\nAll this is speculation and I don't think it'll happen anytime soon as China seems to be in a space of doubling down on censorship, but I can definitely see it as being a good move to do at some point.

China has a very rich and vibrant artistic and cultural landscape inside China. The West having prevented you from accessing it from this side by keeping it away by banning Chinese apps and games when they become popular or by making an inane amount of noise with its own cultural industry does not mean that China's does not exist. Like how a lot of Westerners who signed up with Rednote after the Tiktok ban discovered...\n\nWere you aware that Historic Han Chinese style weddings are the most popular among historic style weddings in China right now? Nope. Have you heard how Wukong kicked the ass of all other games and broke to the top of even the Western charts? Are you aware how the Western gaming industry and leaders are whining about Wukong's \"authoritarian influence\" (well, just 'because')? Nope. Have you heard that China has its own anime sector that has its own style? Nope.\n\nMaybe the censorship is not on their side but is on your side instead...",
