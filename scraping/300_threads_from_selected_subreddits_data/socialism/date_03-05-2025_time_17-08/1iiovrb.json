    "selftext": "While it is probably irrelevant to bring up the \"Alt-Right\" in 2025, it can not be denied that Trump's political ascendance in 2015-2017 was inextricably bound up with it, at least in the mainstream mass media,\u00a0which gave Trump essentially infinite free publicity for ratings. A major component of the \"Alt-Right\" & so-called \"Alt-Lite\" in 2015-2018 or so was the \"Counter-Jihad\" movement, which is almost exclusively controlled by Zionists. One can criticize Islam, obviously, but \"Counter-Jihad\" is largely not really about criticizing Islam as a religion but using a hyper-aggressive criticism of not only Muslims but virtually all Arab culture as a vehicle to shill neoconservative and/or Zionist talking points to defend American imperialism and Israeli settler-colonialism.\u00a0\n\nOne major force in the \"Counter-Jihad\" movement is Daniel Pipes, who is the son of a man named Richard Pipes. The elder Pipes was handpicked by George HW Bush to head \"Team B\", a group created by Bush to challenge pro-detente positions within the CIA by scrutinizing legitimate reports that the Soviets were not a major nuclear threat and publishing disinformation cooked up in think tanks full of feds and corporate elites like the Committee on the President Danger (CPD), the American Security Council (ASC) and the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). This network of disinfo/psywar specialists was associated with another network of think tanks and NGOs which formed an early wave of what is today known as the \"Israel Lobby\" or \"Zionist Lobby\" in Washington, DC. These include the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA) which, as Ed Hermann writes in\u00a0*The Terrorism Industry,*\u00a0was full of \"\u201cReagan administration officials as well as members of the Committee on the Present Danger and Committee for a Democratic Majority\", the latter of which was more or less the Democratic Party branch of the CPD, started by Senator Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson, whose Congressional office was like a\u00a0[bootcamp for many of the most influential neoconservatives of the last 30 years.](https://jewishcurrents.org/henry-scoop-jackson-and-the-jewish-cold-warriors)\n\nAt this time, Donald J. Trump was[\u00a0following in his father's footsteps in becoming a major friend of Israel.\u00a0](https://www.israelhayom.com/2020/10/16/fred-and-donald-trumps-jewish-connection/)He befriended Roy Cohn, a lawyer for the National Crime Syndicate as well as the American intelligence community, who rose to prominence as an ally of J. Edgar Hoover and Joseph McCarthy during the Second Red Scare following World War 2.\u00a0[Cohn was honored in 1983 by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) & B'nai B'rith,](https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Cohn-Dinner.pdf)\u00a0a Jewish fraternal lodge that technically pre-dates the Zionist movement but became one of its most ardent supporters not long after Theodore Herzl birthed it. Cohn was also a part of the \"Jewish League Against Communism\" which emphatically stated that \"Zionism and Communism are incompatible\" and worked hard to help what is considered the modern Israeli right-wing usurp power from the Labor Zionist coalition that controlled Israel's government.\n\nTrump and Cohn\u00a0[became thick as thieves:](https://forward.com/opinion/351591/roy-cohn-and-the-shocking-jewish-mentorship-that-created-donald-trump/)\u00a0\"Cohn would use his connections in government and the mafia to garner massive tax abatements, zoning variances and mob-controlled concrete work, without which Trump\u2019s Grand Hyatt Hotel, Trump Plaza and Trump Tower projects never would have been possible...Cohn would advise Trump in every aspect of his life, business and personal: for years, they would talk on the phone up to five times a day.\" Cohn introduced Trump to another good friend of his, Rupert Murdoch, who, as he was becoming a member of the American power elite,\u00a0[used his sway over mass media to help make the Trump brand into what it is today.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/16/donald-trump-rupert-murdoch-friendship-fox-news)\n\nIn the the late 1980s, Trump met another of his best friends of all time through these same circles, who happened to be another member of not only the American elite but the Zionist Lobby named Jeffrey Epstein, who got his start as an investment banker managing the portfolio of Edgar Bronfman Sr, a member of\u00a0[the criminal Bronfman wealth dynasty](https://artvoice.com/2018/03/the-true-history-and-sinister-origin-of-bronfman-family-wealth/)\u00a0and a the President of the World Jewish Congress, one of the predominant international supporters of Israel. Not long after befriending Trump, Epstein joined his mentor Les Wexner and his former client Edgar Bronfman, as well as Robert Maxwell, the father of his literal partner-in-crime Ghislaine Maxwell,\u00a0[at the Mega Group, on of the biggest Zionist Lobby organizations of the 1990s and early 2000s.](https://mintpressnews.cn/mega-group-maxwells-mossad-spy-story-jeffrey-epstein-scandal/261172/)\n\nTo return to Daniel Pipes and the \"Counter-Jihad\" movement, Pipes started a think tank in the early 2000s called the Middle-East Forum (MEF) which became one of the founding nodes of a new neoconservative/ultra-Zionist network that included the Freedom Center (FC), the Center for Security Policy (CSP) and the Gatestone Institue (GI), founded by Nina Rosenwald. There is\u00a0[\"hardly a single major pro-Israel organization that does not provide Rosenwald with a seat on its board of directors.\"\u00a0](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/sugar-mama-anti-muslim-hate/)The FC was founded by David Horowitz,\u00a0[a friend of Epstein's pal Alan Dershowitz](https://lobelog.com/alan-dershowitzs-deep-ties-to-trumps-biggest-donors/)\u00a0and a major supporter of Trump. CSP was started by Frank Gaffney, the top aide of Richard Perle during the Reagan administration. Perle is a descendant of Scoop Jackson's office and a member of the Project for a New American Century, the most well-known neocon think tank which gained infamy for calling for \"a catalyzing event\" and \"a New Pearl Harbor\" to justify expanding military spending and invading Iraq\u00a0*before*\u00a09/11 happened.\u00a0[Gaffney set up a group he called \"Team B 2.\"](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/center-security-policy)\u00a0During the first Trump campaign,\u00a0[all of these think tanks worked directly with the Mercer Foundation, owned by major Trump patrons Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah Mercer](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/07/tommy-robinson-global-support-brexit-march).\n\nIn 2018, Rosenwald's Gatestone Institute was led by John Bolton, yet another major neocon. That same year, Ezra Levant\u2019s\u00a0*Rebel Media*\u00a0partnered with GI\u00a0[to produce anti-Muslim propaganda.\u00a0](https://lobelog.com/bolton-led-group-partnered-with-racist-anti-semitic-website/)Levant's media company, which soon became a pillar in the \"Alt-Right\" despite its leader being both Jewish and an open Zionist, hosted several figures who were also supporters of Israel, including Faith Goldy ([\u201cI am on the record in favor of a one-state solution. I love Israel](https://ravingcanuck.com/2018/09/01/qa-with-dark-horse-toronto-mayoral-candidate-faith-goldy/)\u201d), Sebastian Gorka, who later joined the Trump administration (Gorka has been referred to as a \u201ctrue friend of Israel and the Jewish people\u201d by journalist Sarah N. Stern, an ardent Zionist, as well as \u201cthe staunchest friend of Israel and the Jewish people\u201d by Israel Allies Caucus Co-chair Trent Franks), and Tommy Robinson, who received $60,000 from Daniel Pipes and thousands more from an Israeli-American billionaire named Richard Shillman (yes that's his real last name). Shillman, who donated over a quarter of a million dollars to Trump in 2020, sits on the boards of two of David Horowitz\u2019s organizations and funded Project Veritas. When George W. Bush visited Israel in 2008, he personally asked for Shillman to escort him through the Zionist settler-colony.\n\nSteve Bannon\u2013who describes himself as[\u00a0a Christian Zionist](https://www.timesofisrael.com/at-zoa-event-bannon-asks-jews-to-join-his-war-on-gop-establishment/)\\-was, when accused of anti-Semitism by liberals in 2016, defended by a plethora of Israelis as well as American neocons,\u00a0[including David Horowitz](https://theintercept.com/2016/11/16/steve-bannon-made-breitbart-space-pro-israel-writers-anti-semitic-readers/). Yossi Dagan, an Israeli politician,\u00a0[also rushed to Bannon\u2019s defense](https://theintercept.com/2016/11/16/steve-bannon-made-breitbart-space-pro-israel-writers-anti-semitic-readers/). Another major ally of Trump\u2019s, tech capitalist Peter Thiel, is, like Bannon, an elitist friend of Israel who calls himself \"anti-establishment.\" Thiel was supported by Irving and Bill Kristol, the father and son neocons,[\u00a0as far back as his days at Stanford University in 1987,](https://www.capitalism.com/serial-entrepreneur-peter-thiel-became-billionaire/)\u00a0and has repeatedly appeared alongside Bill Kristol at speaking events. Thiel is also a major investor in an Israeli surveillance company founded by Amir Elichai,\u00a0[\u201ca former Israeli army officer who served in different positions in the special elite forces and the intelligence corps.\u201d](https://t.co/BkRa3onB4Q)\u00a0An early board member of this company, dubbed Carbyne, was Pinhas Buchris, a former leader of\u00a0 Unit 8200, a special military intelligence unit in Israel. Unit 8200 has a special relationship with Silicon Valley, where, similar to the CIA\u2019s In-Q-Tel, it funds\u00a0[thousands of tech start-ups and contributes innumerable members of staff to American tech companies](https://www.wsj.com/tech/silicon-valleys-hot-talent-pipeline-is-an-israeli-army-unit-e8368b4d)\u00a0every year.\u00a0\n\nJared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, is part of a family that has historically been close not only to the Trumps,\u00a0[but also to the Netanyahus and Israel in general.](https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/americas/137466-170212-nyt-report-reveals-netanyahu-and-kushner-have-long-history-of-friendship)\u00a0Kushner has suggested\u00a0[\"Gaza's waterfront property could be very valuable.\"\u00a0](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/19/jared-kushner-gaza-waterfront-property-israel-negev)The Kushner Foundation has given\u00a0[hundreds of thousands of dollars to Chabad Lubavitch,](https://forward.com/news/359482/kushner-foundation-gives-342k-to-chabad-still-surprised-about-jared-and-iva/)\u00a0a doomsday cult masquerading as a Jewish civil society organization controlled by one of the only groups of Hasidic Jews to be overwhelmingly supporting of Israel rather than either critically supportive or outright hostile to its existence. Chabad Lubavitch are major supporters of Trump and seem to be an agent of Israeli soft power that operates across the world, even in countries at war with each other,\u00a0[including USA, Russia and Ukraine.](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/the-happy-go-lucky-jewish-group-that-connects-trump-and-putin-215007/)\n\nBefore Trump was even sworn-in the first time, his decision to pick Mike Pence as his running mate raised some eyebrows among the \u201cAlt\u201d-Right. While Pence seems to be a good fit for Trump considering he holds one of the most socially conservative voting records in recent Congressional history, he is also a hardline Zionist and unapologetic neocon who seemed to contradict some of Trump\u2019s rhetorical gestures toward \u201canti-interventionism\u201d on the campaign trail. In 2003, Pence, a major ally of Bush Jr. in the House of Representatives,[\u00a0voted for the resolution authorizing the Iraq War](https://www.cnn.com/2016/07/15/politics/mike-pence-foreign-policy-vp-pick/). \u00a0In 2014, Pence visited the Zionist settler-colony, and in 2016 made it illegal for his home-state of Indiana to make deals with companies that boycott the Israeli occupation of Palestine. In 2015, Pence told the Republican Jewish Coalition:[\u00a0\u201cIsrael\u2019s enemies are our enemies, Israel\u2019s cause is our cause. If this world knows nothing else, let it know this: America stands with Israel.\u201d](http://www.reviewjournal.com/politics/presidential-candidate-cruz-others-speak-adelson-primary-vegas)\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump gave the neocons virtually everything they wanted regarding Israel. In 2018, Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and opened a new US embassy there.\u00a0[As\u00a0*Vox*\u00a0reported,](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/14/17340798/jerusalem-embassy-israel-palestinians-us-trump)\u00a0Trump did this in the middle of protests organized by Palestinians at the Israeli border with Gaza: \u201cThe embassy opening also comes right before what Palestinians call Nakba Day, or the Day of Catastrophe, where Palestinians commemorate lands they either fled or were evicted from after the creation of the state of Israel. Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, also begins this week.\u201d\n\n[All of this was likely the result of Israel's \"interference\" in the 2016 presidential election, which was blamed on Russia.](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/trump-israel-collusion/)\u00a0In exchange, Trump gave all of these Zionist/neocon forces a return on their investment in him.
