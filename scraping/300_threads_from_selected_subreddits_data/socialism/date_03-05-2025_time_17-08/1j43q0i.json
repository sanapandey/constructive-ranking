Those can be about socialism as a political movement, about shared struggles, or about anything else related to it.\n\nDo you run a YouTube channel aimed at propagating anti-capitalist ideas? Recently watched a video greatly explaining historical materialism? Looking for video dealing with decolonial feminist theories?\n\nPlease share it with us!\n\n*Please note: if sharing videos, it might be useful to add a short input on what the video is about and why you think it will be of interest to others.*\n\nYours in solidarity, until the robots rebel.\n\n\\- Automod",

I also really love how she connects the culture war issues liberals have been obsessed with back to the class war, and how the freedoms people think they will get from the culture war are unattainable within capitalism.
