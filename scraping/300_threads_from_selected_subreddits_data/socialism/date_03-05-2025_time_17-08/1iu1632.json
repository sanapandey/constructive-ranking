[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq-WbXY9K3E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq-WbXY9K3E)\n\nThey will never show the real reason Somalia was invaded in 1992-1993. It was because of oil. US continued to destabilize Somalia 2006-now through the fake \"war on terror\"\n\n4 oil giants, Conoco, Amoco, Chevron and Phillips carved up Somalia for themselves. They \"owned\" 2/3rds of Somalia\n\nSource: [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-01-18-mn-1337-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-01-18-mn-1337-story.html)\n\nEdit: sigh before the burger army finds this post this invasion was not about \"peacekeeping\"\n\nThe civil war was a direct result of neoliberal policies imposed on Somalia by the IMF that essentially destroyed and deindustrialised the country throughout the Reagan Administration. [https://twn.my/title2/resurgence/2011/251-252/cover06.htm](https://twn.my/title2/resurgence/2011/251-252/cover06.htm)\n\nThe US backed dictator at the time Siad barre sold most of Somalia's land to US oil companies and Bush Sr. invaded Somalia in 1992 to protect these oil interests.",

There are degrees of severity to be aware of. \n\n*Top Gun* is one of the worst examples of military propaganda ever, but hot damn if it isn't entertaining as hell. Peak 80s action, one of the best soundtracks ever, amazing cast, horrible dialogue... And it's basically just a Navy recruitment commercial.\n\n *Blackhawk Down* can be just a good ole fashioned action war movie; there's no story or plot, just a bunch of shooting and explosions, with a shockingly stacked cast. And yeah, they don't get into the complex geopolitical situations in Somalia, they barely even explain the politics from the Americans side. \n\nIt was nowhere near the America-wank-fest that was *American Sniper*. \n\n**Be your own filter**. Enjoy what you want to enjoy, and be aware of who is pulling the strings while you do it.",

I mean, Netflix honestly has a decent documentary crew of we're just talking about production but this docuseries in particular was mostly well done imo.\n\nI feel like the scope of the documentary wasn't really on a macro political scale. They asked the soldiers \"why did you go to Somalia?\" and they all responded with the same canned reason top command gave them which was to protect a UN peacekeeping mission.\n\nBiggest takeaway for me, on top of being disgusted by the US for the nth time, was how little time it takes for the military to murder civilians like it's nothing. They fuck with the locals unprovoked. They assault women and children for nothing. They raze neighborhoods to dust to try to find one militia leader in the name of the mission. I don't think any of them even questions why the Somalis hated them, they knew. \n\nIf they were just there donating food and handing out American flags to kids, they could've kept the initial good will going. Of course, that is fantasy - eventually they'll start killing people once provoked even a little, but still.",

Industry sources said the companies holding the rights to the most promising concessions are hoping that the Bush Administration\u2019s decision to send U.S. troops to safeguard aid shipments to Somalia will also help protect their multimillion-dollar investments there.\n\n>Officially, the Administration and the State Department insist that the U.S. military mission in Somalia is strictly humanitarian. Oil industry spokesmen dismissed as \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cnonsense\u201d allegations by aid experts, veteran East Africa analysts and several prominent Somalis that President Bush, a former Texas oilman, was moved to act in Somalia, at least in part, by the U.S. corporate oil stake.\n\n>But corporate and scientific documents disclosed that the American companies are well positioned to pursue Somalia\u2019s most promising potential oil reserves the moment the nation is pacified. And the State Department and U.S. military officials acknowledge that one of those oil companies has done more than simply sit back and hope for peace.\n\n>Conoco Inc., the only major multinational corporation to maintain a functioning office in Mogadishu throughout the past two years of nationwide anarchy, has been directly involved in the U.S. government\u2019s role in the U.N.-sponsored humanitarian military effort.",
