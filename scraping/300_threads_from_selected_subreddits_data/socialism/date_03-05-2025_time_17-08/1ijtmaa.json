    "selftext": "Hello, I have found a few posts regarding books in this sub but I am interested in both books and other forms of media, like film/show/graphic novels (or even games, I suppose?).\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be straightforwardly leftist (although things like Disco Elysium are always welcome, of course) but at least just devoid of liberal centrist bullshit. The more I started to analyze media I consume the more I realize just how much I have been brainwashed all my life so I am both repulsed by those liberal rhetorics quietly sneaked in and concerned with how much of it I subconsciously take in again. Like I cannot treat Arcane seriously anymore, despite originally enjoying it, because of how painfully centrist it is.\n\nAlso, asking not only for leisure but I am an artist and writer myself and I have found it hard to find good stories and works of art to learn from that don\u2019t perpetuate ideas I am trying desperately to avoid or condemn in my own work. \nThank you!",

            "body": "I\u2019ve always liked Richard Wright\u2019s *Native Son*, and even the more recent posthumous release, *The Man Who Lived Underground* was really good. *American Hunger* is about Wright\u2019s eventual disillusionment with the Communist Party, but still a good read. I wouldn\u2019t watch the HBO film based on *Native Son*\u2014they took out the communism and replaced it with a trade union, so a lot of the politics got neutered. Wright became more of a critic of the communist organizing in his day, but was still a life long leftist and had a lot to say worth considering. \n\nOh, and for a contemporary novel, I highly recommend Ryan Lee Wong\u2019s *Whose Side Are You On?* where the author fictionalized his own story, having been raised by parents who\u2019d been part of the Korean American peace movement and trained him as a Marxist revolutionary growing up. The novel goes through his struggle with his parents who try to bring him back to reality when he gets motivated to leave college in order to devote himself full time to the cadre like they had in their past, while they try to show him that long-term revolutionary struggle looks different from what he imagines in his head, and he needs to prepare to fight in the future too, not just now. Absolutely brilliant discourse on praxis in today\u2019s age, told through a very humanizing story.\n\nSome other great leftist/Marxist novels\u2026 \n\n *A Tale of One January* by Albert Maltz was just released two years ago, after having been banned in the US for 70 years due to the author\u2019s communism. \n\nRalph Ellison\u2019s *Invisible Man* is a must-read, if you never have. \n\nClaude McKay\u2019s *Amiable With Big Teeth: A Novel of the Love Affair Between the Communists and the Poor Black Sheep of Harlem* is incredible\u2014check out his earlier work too.",
