    "selftext": "Hi. I was terminated by a railroad transportation service which shall go nameless. I was a shuttle van driver for them, and had a minor solo accident with a crew on board. I had just entered the freeway when I clipped the right side wall. There was damage to the right front wheel and axle. Then I was put on HR hold. At the time, the crew said they were OK, but it's my understanding they claimed they were hurt later. The company denied my 3rd step grievance today and now I want to escalate it and take it to arbitration. The company clearly violated the union contract by taking so long from the date of the accident (12/25) to when they termed me (1/7). They had 5 days to issue discipline from the day of the accident. My union is UE. It's my understanding that 5 members of the union have to agree that they wiil take it to arbitration. What are the odds that they'll agree, and do I have a case for reinstatement? I've been with the company for 13+ years of loyal service, minus 2 years for the Covid-19 pandemic. Thanks for reading.\n\nEDIT: I'm from California. I work in the private sector.\n\nEDIT 2: Would my question be better asked in another subreddit?",
