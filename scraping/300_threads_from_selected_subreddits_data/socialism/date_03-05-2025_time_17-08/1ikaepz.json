    "selftext": "Hi !\n\nI am interested in the state of political struggles and the figures of subjects that are particularly close to my heart, socialism but not only, feminism, the fight against the harmful effects of capitalism on the environment, the contestation of the pre-established social or political order more generally, in favor of human rights... in different countries and places in the world.\n\nAs said in the question, I am seeking to better understand these struggles and their major figures in the different countries of the world. Can you give me examples and names ?\n\nI am French (yes the state of politics is not great at the moment) so I know a little about the state of the struggles and the major figures in France and in the surrounding countries.",

She wasn't exclusively organizing about feminism, but her work \"Philosophical Trends in the Feminist Movement\" is a very important book in my opinion. There's a French translation here https://foreignlanguages.press/colorful-classics/philosophical-trends-in-the-feminist-movement-french/",
