    "selftext": "I live in the Czech republic and everyone I talk to is terrified of the next election. It looks like Babi\u0161 (basically their trump) is gonna win their next election. Everyone seems sick of the current center -right government and wants something different, but none of the left wing or even center-left parties got a single member in parliament and are currently polling just as low. Does anyone know what happened? This seems like a perfect opportunity for a left-wing populist party to take control. The closest thing they have is the pirate party, which is barely left of center, and even they only got like 2%. I'm trying to familiarize myself with the political situation here but nobody that I've talked to has given me a real answer.",

A relatively new organization- by which I mean it was founded in 1990 and is NOT the same as the KS\u010c, which was the actual ruling party of Czechoslovakia.\n\nAlthough electoralism is situational and its usefulness can be debated, the KS\u010cM's very open and positive attitude towards and collaboration with liberal parties makes it a very bleak, poor choice, and it's basically the only thing we've got.\n\nOn a more public, broad basis, we got the shock economy treatment, privatization of industries, absorption into NATO. The other commenter's mentioned of V\u00e1clav Havel and our current president are spot-on. Attitudes towards communism are incredibly skeptical at the very best, and the KS\u010c are often believed to have been as bad as the Nazis. It's a mix of propaganda, misinterpreted truth and facts stripped of context. We try our hardest to suck up to the US, distance ourselves from our past, and it's reflected in the public reaction to any on-going geopolitical issue, from Ukraine to our media and politicians' utter silence on, or open support of the Palestinian genocide.\n\nTo say the KS\u010c was perfect would, obviously, be an exaggeration. I have my reservations about several actions the party took, but the Nazi comparison is dishonest.\n\nAll that to say, there isn't really a left here. We have the Greens and the Pirates, and we have the anarchist orgs, all different flavors if liberals. It's bleak.",

They've been disbanded, merged, split and reformed a couple of times. They used to work with/be a part of the KS\u010c, having supported the 1948 seizing of power in Czechoslovakia before being officially merged with the KS\u010c. They were subsequently officially reinstated in the 90s with Milo\u0161 Zeman, our previous president, as their head. If you know anything about him, this isn't a good sign.\n\nThey're very much capitalists, working towards a sort of free market capitalism with a certain extent of government regulations and strong welfare state. If we're going to accept that one branch of capitalism can be preferable to another, then yes, they are a greater alternative to Babi\u0161, however they're far from what we need.",
