    "selftext": "Hey hey!\n\nI like learning about history and theory, but I find myself struggling with reading theoretical/ abstract books. I can much rather connect the dots when I'm learning of the first hand experience of someone. So I am looking for recommendations of biographies/ autobiographies/ memoirs/ published journals / first hand accounts of leftist political activist, revolutionaries, guerilleros/-as etc. I'm open for fictional aspects, as long as it's transparent.\n\nE.g. I know of\nDreaming of Another World - Subcomandante Marcos\n.\n\nSara: Prison memoir of a Kurdish Revolutioary - Sakime Cansiz\n.\n\nNo Friend But the Mountains - Behrouz Boochani\n.\n\nAre we the guilty ones?  (Sind immer wir schuldig?) - M\u00fcjgan G\u00fcvenli\n.\n\nAngela Davis - autobiography\n.\n\nMalcolm X - autobiography \n.\n\nDick Gregory - autobiography \n.\n\nRigoberta Menchu - autobiography \n.\n\nVictor Serge - memoirs of a revolutionary\n.\n\nSix Months in Revolutionary Russia - Louise Bryandt\n\nI am especially curious about diaries of guerilleras.\n\nHappy about any recommendations:)",

Great to read with Louise Bryant, as the two were partners at the time.\n\nMuch less well known but also an excellent read, written by a Left Social Revolutionary, is *[Five Days Which Transformed Russia](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2359249.Five_days_which_transformed_Russia)* by S. D Mstislavskii.",
