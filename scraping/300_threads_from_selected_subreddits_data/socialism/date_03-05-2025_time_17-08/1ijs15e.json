There are a lot of problems and errors in some of their policies. \n\nHowever, China has never claimed that they have reached a fully \"communist\" stage. As far as I'm aware, no Communist party has ever claimed to have actually achieved a classless, stateless society like that. It is a lengthy process, not an immediate transformation.\n\nChina does have a mixed economy where a lot of private property has been brought under state control. Immediately abolishing private property in one swoop is rarely a realistic idea, especially for a country as large and as economically underdeveloped as China was when the revolution occurred. They have gone a long way toward seizing the means of production. They still have a long way to go. Whether they will ever get to a totally communist society or whether the capitalist elements of their country will co-opt and infiltrate the movement is certainly a matter of debate. It is a constant struggle. They have made some really amazing achievements, yet there are also many reasons to be skeptical and concerned about some of the choices they have made.\n\nBut simply dismissing their achievements because they aren't a totally communist system already is sort of missing the point IMO.",

You are the one missing the point, relying on the most superficial and vulgar twisting of Marxism, turning it into its opposite. Whether socialism is advancing or has been defeated is a scientific question that you can\u2019t brush away with this liberal nonsense. You talk as if socialist hasn\u2019t already been constructed and the means of production seized before being privatized in the 80s.\n\nThe foundation of socialism is the proletarian-peasant alliance and collective farming, which was created in the PRC during socialist construction pre 1976 and was dismantled by the revisionists in the early 1980s. Your \u201cexplanation\u201d doesn\u2019t even attempt to account for the line struggle between Mao and the likes of Liu Shaoqi or Deng Xiaoping on this essential question, why collective agriculture was developed and why it was destroyed. \n\nYou also equate state ownership with socialism when there is state ownership in capitalist countries all the time, and if the law of value drives production in a state owned entity (which the SOEs in China are), it\u2019s qualitatively indinstinguishable from private capitalist entities. Do you know what m-c-m\u2019 is?\n\nThis conditions for socialism have existed since at least 1960. The proof of this is the fact that socialism existed in 1960s.",
