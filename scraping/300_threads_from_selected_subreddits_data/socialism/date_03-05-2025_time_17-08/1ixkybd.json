    "selftext": "New to subreddit not new to socialism. Recently I have been studying lots of linguistics and geography in college (philosophy major) and reading more and more I realize that I have major knowledge gaps and I feel as if it holds back my understanding and worldview. Anyone have any good recommendations for reliable history books that I can learn from? Even my history classes in college don\u2019t teach me enough. I lack knowledge specifically on South America, Africa(old and modern history), and I only understand a little about middle eastern and south west Asia. If someone could help me or other people fill in this blind spot I would be very grateful.",
