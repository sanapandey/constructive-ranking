            "body": "German here. There's a lot to be unhappy about with this result. AfD and CDU support are terrifying, and the bourgeois \"centre-left\" parties are going more right wing all the time. 8.8 per cent for die Linke is a very welcome surprise, though. They were at 3% in the polls just a few weeks ago and the energy around them recently has been very intense. They just outright won young voters too. And, barring the others voting with the AfD, there can be no changes to the constition without Linke votes this time around. Centrists are already panicking about that, since it'll make it much harder for them to amend to German constitution to just spend extreme amounts on war.\n\nI mean, for as long as we care about parliamentarism at all, Linke is as good as it gets in Germany, and especially this time around their programme and messaging were actually quite good. Especially Ines Schwerdtner, the co-party head, is a real comrade. She's just extremely smart and well informed and there's some signs she's actually way more left even than she publicly performs.",

A few days before the election Scholz again excluded any coalition with Linke, mostly due to foreign policy differences. For their part, Linke has historically oscillated between saying their end goal is to build coalitions with SPD and Greens and being more opposed to it and effecting the changes the can by being an opposition party. At the moment they strongly tend towards the latter. After recent weakness there was an idea to \"rebuild the party from the ground up\", which explicitly included making it a home and power base for the German left in more ways than just explicitly in parliament, becoming a home for activists, having better cooperations with unions and so on. So if any change is gonna come from die Linke, for now it's going to be from the opposition, using the parliament and structure and money the party provides as just \\*some\\* of the ressources a broader left can have to exert power.",
