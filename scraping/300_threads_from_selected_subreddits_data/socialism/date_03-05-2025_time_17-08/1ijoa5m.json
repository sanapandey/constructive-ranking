    "selftext": "\u201cFrom two co-founders of the largest tenants union in the country, this deeply reported account of the resurgent tenant movement centers poor and working-class people who are fighting back, staying put, and remaking the city in the process. Authors Tracy Rosenthal and Leonardo Vilchis take us to trilingual strategy meetings, raucous marches against gentrification, and daring eviction defenses where immigrants put their lives on the line. These are the seeds of the revolutionary movement we need to make our housing, our cities, and the world our home.\u201d\n\nHere is a link to buy the book for 50% off from Haymarket: \nhttps://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/2443-abolish-rent?discount_code=AbolishRent&link_id=1&can_id=c797e55d16a81c86f7dc4852679ab633&source=email-introducing-new-steering-committee-and-planned-activities&email_referrer=email_2603781&email_subject=introducing-new-steering-committee-and-planned-activities\n\nEvery day, the conditions for tenant organizing become more favorable. The housing crisis worsens, and the tenant class grows. We now have a landlord-in-chief. As the empire weakens, real estate profiteering must increase to satiate the ruling class, driving deeper immiseration of tenants. We need a union at work and a union at home. \n\nIf you want your community to be organized and prepared as possible for whatever lies ahead, you NEED a tenant organization. If there\u2019s already a tenant organization in your community, join it! They probably need the help.\n\nIf there isn\u2019t, start one! Don\u2019t worry about doing everything perfectly. Just start learning, build a social media presence, and start canvassing your building or the buildings of your worst local slumlord. Your first time canvassing might be shitty and that\u2019s fine, you\u2019ll learn a lot very quickly. We started our city\u2019s tenant organization about 8 months ago and we still feel like we don\u2019t know shit, but at least we\u2019re finally putting theory into practice. \n\nReach out to tenant organizations in your state or neighboring states. They will be excited to meet you and share advice along the way. Start checking out organizations like the recently formed Tenant Union Federation and the older Autonomous Tenants Union Network. \n\nHere are some great podcasts: \n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/revolutionary-left-radio/id1218054701?i=1000443268388\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-dig/id1043245989?i=1000598078582\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/revolutionary-left-radio/id1218054701?i=1000670687732\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/revolutionary-left-radio/id1218054701?i=1000674859721\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/revolutionary-left-radio/id1218054701?i=1000552966791\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-dig/id1043245989?i=1000685780571\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-dig/id1043245989?i=1000687926384\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/srsly-wrong/id872292891?i=1000676563326\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rent-strike-podcast/id1741048740",
