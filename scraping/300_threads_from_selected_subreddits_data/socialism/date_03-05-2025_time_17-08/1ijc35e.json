    "selftext": "I recently watched a documentary by a Korean American Filmmaker that follows two North Koreans who were tricked and imprisoned by South Korean officials. They ultimate were coerced into giving up their North Korean citizenships and become South Koreans. One of the North Koreans was a woman who desperately attempted to go back home to North Korea but the South Korean officials were always there to stop her and constantly monitored her. The film is in Korean but I can\u2019t seem to locate it anywhere. Any information about the Filmmaker or the Documentary would be very much appreciated!",
