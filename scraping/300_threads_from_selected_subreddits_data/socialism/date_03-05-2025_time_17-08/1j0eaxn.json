    "selftext": "I believe class solidarity requires mutual support among workers to fight against exploitation. Yet, throughout U.S. history, the white working class has overwhelmingly prioritized racial hierarchy over class unity, repeatedly siding with white elites against Black workers and other marginalized groups.\n\n**Labor Unions and Racial Exclusion**: White-dominated unions often excluded Black workers, even using violence to protect \"white jobs.\" From the late 19th century through the mid-20th century, many labor movements actively fought against integration rather than capitalists. Even the New Deal labor protections largely excluded Black workers to appease white Southern Democrats.\n\n**Jim Crow and the Working Class:**\u00a0The white working class overwhelmingly supported segregation, voting for politicians who upheld Jim Crow laws. The civil rights movement wasn\u2019t won through class solidarity. it was achieved in spite of white workers, many of whom violently resisted desegregation and resisted MLK's class consciousness by race alone.\n\n**Modern-Day Economic Populism:**\u00a0Even today, when class consciousness should be rising due to corporate exploitation, many white workers are more likely to blame immigrants, DEI initiatives, or \"woke capitalism\" rather than the billionaires actually profiting off their labor. When presented with multiracial labor movements, many white workers still retreat into reactionary politics rather than uniting across racial lines.\n\n**Conclusion:**\u00a0The history is clear: Most of the white working class has consistently failed to choose solidarity when given the option. Their racial biases have been weaponized to keep them in line with the very elites they\u00a0*should*\u00a0be fighting against. Until white workers reckon with this reality and actively dismantle their ingrained racial resentments, true class solidarity will remain impossible.\n\nCan anyone give any further context or significant examples toward the contrary?",

Racism and other racial hierarchies are built upon the ultimate division of class under capitalism. You\u2019re looking at white workers as a class in and of itself when you should be aware that no matter the skin color, all workers are the same working class.",

            "body": "In modern times we\u2019re not seeing a reaction to equality in the workforce, it\u2019s backlash to targeted equity programs. I should say perceived equity because so many DEI policies aren\u2019t leveling the playing field for historically marginalized groups, so much as opening doors for the most economically sound within those groups.\n\nAnd I would even say that the modern obsession with identity on the right is a reactionary repackaging of the course identicist rhetoric that splintered the progressives from much of the social left in the 2010\u2019s. Unfortunately, the results will likely have implications for the visibility of many historically marginalized groups.\n\nMy point, which I\u2019ve nearly lost, is that identity based equity is a perpetually dividing factor in the working class, no matter who is leveraging it. Whether it be race or gender or sex or ethnicity. Those topics are important for visibility, but from a policy standpoint, they inherently faction the working class.",
