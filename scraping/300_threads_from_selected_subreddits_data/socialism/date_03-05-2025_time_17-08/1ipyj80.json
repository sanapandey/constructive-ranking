However, they were stopped by the people of the area, predominantly Irish and Jewish, who in solidarity fought the fascists and cops (as if there's a difference) until they turned back in defeat. That was the Battle of Cable Street, and it effectively ended the wide-scale threat posed by British fascists, at least for that generation.\n\nSo yeah, it *is* worth it. Lincoln Heights is the oldest independently governed black neighborhood north of the Mason-Dixon, which is likely why it was targeted.
