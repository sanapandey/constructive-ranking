    "selftext": "In capitalism, people who want to buy businesses sell ownership of their venture to get the initial capital. If they take a loan, the bank owns future earnings and can take the assets if not repaid. If they give equity, the shareholders literally own the means of production.\n\n  \nSo, if that wouldn't happen in socialism, how would people acquire the money to start the business? I imagine that it could be given my the local community, however that's essentially the same thing as saying the government and the definition of a command economy. Command economies run into problems with inefficiencies that are beyond the scope of this question to go into. Is there a better way this could be done in socialism?\n\nAnd in socialism, how capitalism be prevented from re-existing? What would prevent someone from giving a loan or selling equity to start a business and hiring workers?\n\n  \nThis is not meant as a critique or takedown of alternative economic systems. I'm asking out of genuine curiosity and an open mind.",

            "body": "It is a fundamental misunderstanding that a community equates the state. \n\nIndeed socialism is a planned economy. The community creates businesses to cover their needs, not to extract profits and become wealthy in the expense of another community. \n\nI am not sure that you understand what socialism is. A person creating a business and hiring someone to work for them is not socialism. \n\nI definitely disagree that planned economies are inefficient. In fact they are way more efficient when compared to free market and the existence of China  should be enough of a proof (not socialist but still planned economy at large). \n\nI do not see how we are more efficient when we sabotage each other in the name of competition and free market. \n\nI have worked for many years on innovative technologies and you cannot imagine the harm \"competition\" has done to our progress",

Or a loan, but that doesn't mean the bank (which is also socialist) owns or control anything, there's a debt, with terms - and if that debt is serviced then the creditor has no say, and if the debitor wants different terms - they can look for another creditor with other terms.\n\nMaybe the future users of your services or products will provide a loan to get a local supplier - the only restriction that I see is \"no ownership without labor.\"\n\nHow to prevent somebody from selling equity and hiring workers (presumably without giving them equity)? It's a bit of moot question; how do you prevent somebody from hiring children to sell heroin? There's no answer. It's illegal and it is dealt with when it happens. That's how you prevent things - \"oh, so you're telling me you own 'equity' and therefore can syphon off the surplus value created by those workers over there? well, that's not allowed, so you don't and you can't.\"\n\nI hope I didn't misunderstand your questions.

            "body": "As someone else pointed out, capitalism is horribly inefficient. I spent a long time in science and engineering where everyone is constantly forced to drop long projects, or experienced team members are fired and replaced with cheaper temps who need to be trained up to basic proficiency, all on the whims of clueless greedy investors, short contract cycles, grant review committees, and executives who don't have a clue what their employees actually do but get to order them around anyway.\n\n\nSome other huge sources of inefficiency are rent and land hoarding. The former is often one of a business's biggest expenses and is one of the main reasons local businesses in particular have to shut down with such regularity: They just can't afford to keep paying the unproductive leech who \"owns\" the land. The latter prevents people with new ideas from opening businesses with any land needs at all. This all stems from the capitalist (and feudalist) obsession with treating land as \"capital\" to be stolen, hoarded, and rented out exorbitantly to the people who actually do meaningful work. Socialist systems eliminate these massive inefficiencies when they eliminate concepts like rent, \"landowner\", and of course, capital in general.\n\n\nFor a general intro to some relevant concepts, I recommend David Graeber's books *Bullshit jobs* and *Debt: The first 5,000 years.* He was an anarchist, not a socialist, so I disagree with some of his conclusions, but his reasoning covers many of the same basic critiques a socialist would make and are very accessible and pleasant to read.",
