Too many associate it with cracking rocks and eating rations.",

That's just to start. I think what Christians do well is work across sects on issues instead of obsessing with demanding everyone be Catholic. They decide they want to go after trans people for instance and put divisions aside to work on that issue. If all the assorted socialist sects focused on a living wage, for instance, that might unite them just enough to accomplish something.",

When push comes to shove, they capitulate to the GOP, especially with the current HoR configuration, meaning they serve no purpose other than to demoralize workers in the face of the corporatists who finance and lobby both parties equally.\n\nIn practical terms I would say _maybe_ they can more accurately be described as a conservative party, in that they envisage a slower implementation of essentially the same policies as the Republicans, who have become rabid accelerationists. But make no mistake, the American electoral system ultimately only decides what scope the  - sorry for the tired clich\u00e9 - imperial machine will operate with.",
