From March 10 to March 19, the US and South Korea will be conducting Freedom Shield, their massive annual springtime joint military drills on the peninsula.\n\nWhile the South Korean masses are battling the ongoing political crisis and chaos created by the Yoon impeachment, the US is taking advantage of this moment to escalate hostilities against North Korea, endangering millions of Koreans and pushing Korea closer to the brink of war.\n\nThe people of the US cannot afford to stand idly by as the money we need for housing, healthcare, and education is squandered to restart war in Korea. Join us as we say NO to US War Threats & CANCEL Freedom Shield!\n\nImages Source: \n- https://www.instagram.com/p/DGgK1xmR0RQ/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet\n- https://www.instagram.com/p/DGOOEfAxalI/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet\n- https://www.instagram.com/p/DGLxLF8x6ii/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet\n\n*\u201cWhile some may believe Trump could put a stop to the growing risk of war on the peninsula, we reject this as an ahistorical and misinformed position. In 2017, President Trump threatened to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d Korea with \u201cfire and fury\u201d, and imposed the most punishing sanctions regime against the DPRK that our people have ever faced.\u201d* -Nodutdol https://nodutdol.org/nodutdol-statement-what-does-a-trump-presidency-mean-for-korea/\n\n**Listen to the Blowback Podcast Season 3**\n\nNorth Korea Truth & Lies: Challenging the Propaganda, w/ Ju-Hyun Park: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=acZVbISIZg4\n\nHow South Korea Enslaved Women for U.S. Troops for Years: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oRr5t9kw2C4\n\nCold War 2: US officials call to overthrow China\u2019s gov\u2019t, expand military budget to $1.4 trillion: https://youtu.be/Q3RMl33SqNE?feature=shared\n",

I\u2019ll avoid mass gatherings of people on the weekend during my only time to rest and recharge from the fucked up weeks I have. I\u2019m so done risking my health. Maybe if people masked again I would go but it\u2019s just too much considering what I deal with every day and that the pandemic never ended.",

There are many other people in the same or similar situations as me who would love to do things like this and be involved but they can\u2019t because of everyone out and about spreading disease (including Covid-19, bird flu, RSV, norovirus, flu a) like we aren\u2019t in an ongoing pandemic. \n\n\nBut go ahead, be needlessly rude and aggressive.\n\nYou\u2019re in socialist and communist subs - aren\u2019t you for community? Anti-capitalism? Disability justice? No pandemic denial? Or did you vax and relax + listen to Biden and the CDC when they told everyone to unmask if they wanted and you\u2019re still in denial? What is the problem? Why are you so angry, defensive and mean? \n\nInstead of acknowledging this very real and shitty problem I brought up in my comment, you take a stab at me?? \n\nI don\u2019t know what your problem is, but for people who call libs bootlickers there sure are a hell of a lot of so-called leftists who are perfectly fine with the pandemic that was prematurely \u201cended\u201d all for the capitalist agenda. The hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance is astonishing. So much for being for community. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re just f-cking rude and nasty, for no reason. Messed up.",
