In a few years they may rule many more countries than they currently do.\n\nDo you see socialism rising and having a comeback as a reaction against fascism?",

We have to be the reaction. \n\nA really problematic shift in the internet age is that people now hold their image of the future based on what they think others will do rather than on their own actions. We perceive our actions to have limited effect (which might be that we have a more accurate perspective of it) and then do not act. \n\nRattle your chains, throw sand in the gears, and most importantly try to organize others to do the same. Don't sit back waiting for \"the inevitable revolution\" because it's only inevitable if we all stop waiting.\n\nRattling your chains doesn't have to mean pulling a luigi (although that is amazing if you have the guts). It can be as small as organizing a free breakfast program. Capitalists need the threat of starvation to survive, if you can find a way to feed and house people it throws sand in the gears and can change people's lives.\n\nAny successful movement will need to also serve it's community. The Black Panthers had clinics, breakfast for children, jobs, and did all kinds of other things to build their communities. Not only is this important just because of what it is, but it also builds the image of the revolution and shows people what communism is about.",

The result is that the right wing usually wins the propaganda war. It's totally possible that people never realize that the right wing isn't on their side or that every socialist movement just gets astroturfed or destroyed. We can't just sit around and hope that people are going to come over to our side when there are incredible forces trying to stop them from doing that constantly.",

Too bad it was squandered by oligarchs who funneled all of their money into bribing churches and pastors to teach \u201cProsperity Gospel\u201d (God rewards good people with money, tithing is mandatory) instead, which dissolved the movement by the 40\u2019s.

There is no difference other than the amount of contradictions, the core contradictions remain they just look slightly different over time as no system remains the same through time.",
