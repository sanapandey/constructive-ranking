It was disturbing enough under Biden, and I knew it\u2019d get worse under Trump, but even still I didn\u2019t predict they would be so shockingly brazen about conducting a genocide.\n\nSo, I know I\u2019m late, and I know I should\u2019ve done more sooner\u2014but I\u2019m here. What can I do to fight this abhorrent bullshit that my fucked up government is doing? And just as, if not more importantly\u2014what can I do that\u2019ll actually help the people of Palestine who are suffering?\n\nThank you for any advice.",

Personally I\u2019m just waiting for a serious movement to get behind.",

I also am waiting for a movement, but can we wait that long? Can we sit back and wait for someone else to do the work? As people who know what's at stake aren't we responsible to be the leaders in a such  movement? Especially when the people of this country won't mobilize until it effects them which is still so far off. These are the questions I wrestle with constantly",

Getting rid of medicaid would cause millions of americans to lose their healthcare and the families of those people will probably end up having to help foot the bills. As much as I hate the current administration, they\u2019re doing more than anything we can do to expedite the timeline to large scale revolution. When people start losing family members due to the obvious greed it will hopefully make them realize what\u2019s happening. I think we\u2019re a lot closer than you believe. I don\u2019t want people to die but it\u2019s going to happen if they keep going the way they are.",
