    "selftext": "# The titles changed, but the power structures remained.\n\nThe **lord** became the **landlord**.  \nThe **knight** became the **police officer**.  \nThe **priest** became the **psychiatrist**.  \nThe **manor** became the **bureaucracy**.  \nThe **serf** became the **tenant**, the **debtor**, the **\u201cclient\u201d of the system**.\n\nIn medieval times, serfs were bound to the land. Today, people are bound by **credit scores**, **leases**, **insurance policies**, and **medical records**. Instead of being **born into servitude**, you\u2019re **processed into it** through **paperwork, debt, and diagnosis**.\n\nFeudalism was always about **control disguised as protection**. That hasn\u2019t changed. The **crown** is now a **corporate logo**, the **castle** is a **government office**, and the **church** is a **credentialing body** that declares who is **worthy of autonomy** and who must be **\u201ccared for\u201d against their will**.\n\nEven the **concept of ownership** is feudal in nature. **Renting?** You\u2019re a serf, paying tribute to the landlord. **Mortgaged?** You\u2019re a vassal, holding land only by permission of the bank. **Freehold?** Even then, **property taxes** ensure you\u2019re never truly sovereign.\n\nAnd the **psychiatric-industrial complex**? That\u2019s the **new Inquisition**. Once labeled as **\u201cmentally unfit,\u201d** you\u2019re stripped of rights, much like being branded a **heretic** in the old days. **Resist the diagnosis**, and it only **confirms their judgment**.\n\nThe **night raid** you witnessed? **Straight out of the feudal playbook**:\n\n* **Darkness for deniability.**\n* **Swift, overwhelming force.**\n* **Removal of the \u201cproblem\u201d before anyone can intervene.**\n\nThe system **never truly changed**\u2014it just traded **iron shackles for institutional ones**, and **overt violence for procedural suffocation**.\n\nThe **illusion of progress** is the **greatest trick feudalism ever pulled**. It convinced us we were **free**, while the **infrastructure of domination** grew more **efficient, polite, and sanitized**.\n\nSo the question isn\u2019t **\u201cDid feudalism die?\u201d** It\u2019s **\u201cWhen did we stop recognizing it?\u201d**",

The source only becomes relevant when investigating motive... in this case, motive is as obvious as one can be... it's purely out of self interest... as that's what justice is... a selfish desire, without exception.  That's not a bad thing. It's just a fact.\n\nIt's a derivation of what's good for the goose is good for the gander.  In other words, morality.\n\nThere's wanting justice for others... but the idea of \"justice\" as a generalized concept is about the self, in how we might be abused by a system or by others. So your point is what? If the issue is the words came from a printer... I think we have a much bigger problem on our hands then this one post... or did you forget, AI is literally spitting out ideas and concepts it learned from... oh wait... what was it again? That's right... LITERATURE WRITTEN BY PEOPLE.\n\nThis is elementary, my dear...",

Under capitalism, we work for wages, selling our labor power for a certain amount of time and are payed via accumulated capital. Under feudalism, serfs grow crops and give a certain amount of it to their Lord. Also, under feudalism, production of goods is invldividual and goods are produced to be used. Under capitalism, goods are produced socially to be sold as commodities.",

The lie we're so often told is how anyone can 'climb the ranks of society'... through their own merit...\n\nBut with a hidden bureaucracy we can't challenge the credibility of... we're left with serfdom.",
