Of course labour is necessary somewhere in the chain, but for the most part they are hoping to draw on *historical* labour to drive AI, removing the need for current labour in many (not all, especially at the everyday manual end) cases.",

Human labour is incredibly useful, that's why they want us cheap and in high numbers, with a lot of social and cultural divisions and economically of course, that's why the engineer feels superior to the janitor, despite both being labourers. \n\nThese divisions exist for many reasons, one of which is to make it harder for workers to stand together and organize.",

That is, it INCREMENTS the tensions inherent to capitalism. Technology under capitalism does NOT reduce necessary labour time, but merely redoubles the goals of pursuing the maximization of benefit. That is, if a company gets rid of X workers due to the adoption of new technologies, this provides it with a temporal benefit only. A temporal benefit which will eventually be overtaken by competing corporations (which will adopt the same or better technologies), as a result recentring the need for labour as the irreducible and unavoidable element of production.\n\nThe only scenario where labour could be replaced in the long term (and not just as a temporal stage) is in a context of imposition of planetary biophysical limits over productive dynamics. That is, where the increase of the rate of exploitation was materially unsustainable. And even in this case, as we see every year when we go beyond planetary boundaries in 1/3 of a year, this will not happen under capitalism. Capitalists would prefer to perish in their roles than to go against the interests of capital.\n\nOn Marx(ism) and technology: \n\n- https://mronline.org/2021/05/07/marx-on-technology/\n\n- https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/05/28/marx-grundrisse-ai-artificial-intelligence-china-david-harvey/",

These large tech companies are pressured to innovate the next big thing to keep up with the demands of capitalism.",
