Are there any guidelines or recommendations for these types of workers?",

I\u2019m going to start feeling out coworkers today. It\u2019s scary because our census is low right now, so I\u2019m not sure if they would use this as an excuse to try and let some people go?

There\u2019s always ways to contribute.  My current hospice doesn\u2019t have a union either, but at least we are locally owned so I feel like my bosses will understand where we are coming from.
