    "selftext": "Hey all, I am an Environmental Studies student and my class asked us to create a fake urban planning project that would solve problems in urban societies. I have already completed it (I discussed community gardens growing free produce) but was curious on if there was any other socialist urban planning and sustainable infrastructure ideas that others may have or readings/resources to learn about them. I hope to maybe have a spot in local government where I can implement some ideas!\n\n\n",
