    "selftext": "North Korea is consistently rebuffing Trump\u2019s attempts to restart dialogue. Why? The reason has a lot to do with the recent history of US negotiations with North Korea, and the Trump administration\u2019s actions.\n\nSince the 1980s, the US and North Korea have entered dialogue four times, most recently during Trump\u2019s first term. Each time, North Korea expressed openness to denuclearization, and even took concrete steps to achieve this. The US, however, did not reciprocate by ending its hybrid war on North Korea: the military exercises, propaganda war, and sanctions regime that keep North Korea under siege and economically isolated.\n\nAfter decades of trying, North Korea\u2019s position has changed. North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal is no longer up for negotiation, and it sees deterrence as the only way to prevent further US aggression. In spite of this, Trump has based his cals for diplomacy on the idea that North Korea should still denuclearize. Nevermind that the US has over 100 times more nuclear weapons than North Korea.\n\nWhile all this talk about peace and dialogue emanate from Washington, the US military in Korea is sending a different message. In February alone, the US has sent a nuclear submarine and B-1B bombers to Korea, and US occupation forces have staged multiple war drills, including live fire exercises along the DMZ, heavy bombing drills, and even Space Force exercises. In March, the massive Freedom Shield war games will take place on schedule, and this time with 70% more war drills than last year.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions show his goal is not peace, but to strengthen US imperialism\u2019s hold on Korea and the region. This policy is no different than Biden\u2019s, who also begged Kim Jong Un for \u201cdialogue\u201d while ramping up war threats in Korea. The empire may have a new salesman, but its basic character remains intact.\n\nImages Source: https://www.instagram.com/p/DGixDwKuCwK/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet\n\n*\u201cWhile some may believe Trump could put a stop to the growing risk of war on the peninsula, we reject this as an ahistorical and misinformed position. In 2017, President Trump threatened to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d Korea with \u201cfire and fury\u201d, and imposed the most punishing sanctions regime against the DPRK that our people have ever faced.\u201d* -Nodutdol https://nodutdol.org/nodutdol-statement-what-does-a-trump-presidency-mean-for-korea/\n\n**Listen to the Blowback Podcast Season 3**\n\nNorth Korea Truth & Lies: Challenging the Propaganda, w/ Ju-Hyun Park: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=acZVbISIZg4\n\nHow South Korea Enslaved Women for U.S. Troops for Years: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oRr5t9kw2C4\n\nThe US government\u2019s talks with Russia are more about China than Ukraine.
