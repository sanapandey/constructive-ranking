The victims of cointelpro had to commit a bne to get the files to for sure prove what they felt. Keep your cameras out when something odd occurs near you or your community. Fascists and police have likely tightened their networks, and we don't exactly have access to the details. With that being said, remain vigilant, and do not let strange things occur in secrecy. Noticed how the car ran off our friend said \"I'm filming live btw\". He wasn't even live. This was a smart lie that could have very well saved his life.  Many people who film demonstrations or police abuse know to do it live, because if police get it they are known to delete footage or destroy cameras/phones. We will be doing the best to protect the anonymity so this is currently being widely shared but without details on the individual or neighborhood. Thank you. ",

There's public evidence to back they are moving in this direction, but it's also important to note that before fascists were entering into street brawls with protestors their militants had wrapsheets for anything from murder, to armed robbery and kidnappings/trafficking. I noticed in a video of the SRA being interviewed, they said a comrade of theirs was doxed in a militia telegram they got access to and saying things like \"got info on another\". Definifely keep your head on a swivel. \n\nThis was from cointelpro in the 60s and 70s\n\n\"The ACLU has claimed the FBI supported an extreme right-wing group of former\u00a0Minutemen, transforming it into a group called the\u00a0Secret Army Organization\u00a0that targeted groups, activists, and leaders involved in the Anti-War Movement, using both intimidation and violent acts.\" \n\n\"According to the ACLU report, Lincoln Bueno, a member of the left-wing\u00a0Chicano\u00a0organization\u00a0Brown Berets, and Bohmer were to be lured over the border to a remote location in\u00a0Tijuana, Mexico, where they would be murdered by\u00a0Mexican Federal police\u00a0over a contrived cache of smuggled firearms.\"",

They roll the window down and ask about a converse store (there are none). He tells them to back off saying he don't know shit and he sees them following him. That's when they reverse with intent, and say nothing. The driver and passenger were both in military fatigue.  When our comrade said he was live streaming to friends, the vehicle peeled out.",

They operate in secrecy when they need to so documenting these things is important. \n\nhttps://itsgoingdown.org/fbi-intimidation-continues-olympia-wa/\n\nhttps://itsgoingdown.org/a-note-on-recent-fbi-visits-in-seattle/\n\n\n\"\n\u2014 Puget Sound Anarchists\n\n\nShare This:\n \n \n\"The following article was originally posted on Puget Sound Anarchists.\nThis morning, Friday April 27th, FBI agents visited at least three houses in Seattle and left business cards with the names of individuals they wanted to talk to written on the back. At one house the agents picked packages up on the porch and pretended to be delivery people in order to confirm the identities of those living there. When it became clear they were not delivery people the door was quickly slammed in their faces.\n\nThese visits have become a yearly ritual. In the week before May Day, the feds do the rounds to make sure that everyone knows they are watching. We should see this for what it is \u2013 an intimidation tactic and part of a strategy of repression designed to scare people out of organizing. It is important to take visits like this seriously, but their predictability also makes it fairly clear that they are mostly intended to make people feel afraid.\"",
