    "selftext": "Good companions.\nI have decided to make this post since I have been dissatisfied with \"my party\" for some time.\n\nFor a few years now I have been active in the Spanish Socialist Workers Party. Which in its origins was really socialist, with some ideas and a desire to really fight for our class. But today it is nothing more than a shadow of what it once was.\n\nLike most socialist parties I know, it has \"sold out\" to social democracy. And the truth is that I don't know what to do.\n\nI officially joined the party because of my desire to help my city, where they have governed since I can remember. And my colleagues in the local group, the majority are really socialists but at the national level things change a lot.\n\nSince I was 18 years old I have been voting for this party, more than anything else, out of inertia. Since the only party that could \"stand up\" to him has gone down the drain after years of ineffective policies and the persecution of the right-wing media and the press.\n\nYears later the so-called \"Workers' Front\" appeared. A political group that claimed to be really left-wing. Which, in the end, have ended up being damned Islamophobes and red-browns (Red Fascists) like the German BSW party.\n\nI really believe that neither in Spain nor in Europe is there a good socialist option. And I don't know what to do about it, I don't know whether to stop voting for the Spanish Socialist Workers Party, or to cast a null vote directly.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you think there are any good matches currently? Does anyone believe that all these social-democratic parties will return to their origins?",

Now, the way of doing politics is different, and social democracy will have to fight hard to continue existing within the political space.\n\nAs for the Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE), I would reflect on whether it was ever truly socialist, at least in its post-Franco era. That party has had some highly questionable figures like Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez or Garc\u00eda Page, and they have implemented measures more aligned with liberalism than socialism.\n\nFrente Obrero is not left-wing; they\u2019re just a group of thugs who pretend to be left-wing but are just as fascist as those from Desokupa because they share the same rhetoric. I\u2019m not sure why you mentioned them.\n\nBut with other left-wing groups in Spain, are you really going to cast a null vote, effectively paving the way for the right and far-right to enter the next Spanish government? Think carefully about it.\n\nHonestly, I'd rather a Pedro S\u00e1nchez, Yolanda D\u00edaz or a Ione Belarra than a Feij\u00f3o or a Fachascal.",

I did not live through the transition, but it will always seem like a mistake to me that the leftist sectors did not fight \"truly\" and we ended up settling for this so-called (I think) democracy and being governed by a Brother-Killer and his royal offspring. Really, what I can't stand about the PSOE is that they say they are the brakes on the fascists, and the next day we have the Minister of Housing saying that the housing issue will be solved by talking to the landlord vultures. But hey, I guess for now we'll have to make do with what we have.\n\n>Frente Obrero is not leftist\n\nNow they obviously aren't, and it makes me angry. Because if they hadn't ended up becoming what they are, maybe it would have been a good match, wanting to fight in the street, etc. But instead all they do is blacken the name of Socialism and Communism, and indirectly agree with the fools who say that communism and fascism are the same.\n\n>Are you really going to vote null?\n\nI have never really considered voting null, since I think the same as you. I simply raised the idea, to see if someone thought it would be a good idea.",

However, your efforts may be better served by working at a grassroots level within your community. Lots of change and influence can be had at the community level.",

                    "body": "Politics in Spain is a joke in itself. Few people take it seriously, and those who do and acquire a certain amount of public power expose themselves to being torn apart by the media beasts. \nTo give you an idea, the main Spanish Communist Party (there are several, one may seem like a joke) has openly renounced the seizure of power through the revolution of the proletariat. \n\nAs a quick summary of Spanish Politics:\n\n -Popular party: It is the main rival of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party. Founded by Francoist ministers with a supposedly \"moderate\" ideology. Even though they are \"moderate\", their pulse does not tremble when it comes to agreeing with the main far-right party (Vox), which has caused many cities and regions to regress enormously due to their shitty policies.\n\n-Spanish Socialist Workers Party: Originally it was a split from the Spanish Communist Party. Today it is the ruling party, with a supposedly left-wing ideology but they end up being stale social democrats.\n\n-We can: After the events and protests of 15-M, this party appeared with fresh ideas and a great desire to fight. After a coalition government with the Socialist Party, which I don't know if I benefit from them, they have ended up marginalized and with a split that left them without strength or thinking heads with which to continue putting up a fight. I have to say that its main leader, Pablo Iglesias, has suffered a lot of persecution by the media, to the point of harassing him in his own home and accusing him of new shit every month. Seriously, it's not a joke, I encourage you to look for information about this.\n\n-Sumar: The split that buried Podemos. They were supposedly going to change things (like everyone\ud83d\ude02). But it has ended up being the Socialist Party 2.0, more modern and with a Galician woman as leader.\n\n-Vox: The latent cancer in the congress of deputies. Currently it is one of the great political forces, unfortunately. I honestly don't know how to classify them, something obvious is that they are ultra-right but I don't think even they know what the hell they are. They are patriots, defending what is ours, blah blah, but then their leader, Santiago Abascal, does not hesitate to lick Trump's ass, who does not hesitate to publicly affirm that he is going to raise tariffs on our country's products. See if their leader is ridiculous, he is against divorce and in favor of La Mili (compulsory military service), and he himself is divorced and at the time he did everything he could to avoid doing military service. They were and are financed by the Mexican fascist and ultra-Catholic collective El Yunque.\nAmong their ranks they have numerous personalities from the Spanish ultra-right. At their rallies it is common to see the Franco flag and \"nostalgic\" people singing Cara Al Sol, when supposedly both things are \"illegal\", and no one does anything to prevent the exaltation of Francoism.\n\nAnd to finish, we have a batch of the most curious parties, such as the La Falange party and its splits. Which is literally the same party that governed civil life during the dictatorship. During that time they were dedicated to maintaining tight control over civilian life. Did you want to be someone or get a favor? It would be better for you to belong to the party or know someone important within it.\n\nRegarding what you have told me about helping at the community level. Currently this is what I am trying to do, I would like to one day have some position of responsibility in my city council and be able to make my town grow with good policies.\n\nThanks for reading it, and I'm sorry for the piece of text I wrote. I hope it doesn't get too heavy\ud83d\ude05",

Most states have both a state Senate and a state house of representatives. Each county has an equal # of Senate seats, while the house is divided up by population. So, New York City has more house reps than a rural county due to population.

As a libertarian socialist (a.k.a. anarchist), I personally oppose subsidized unions, such as UGT, CCOO or CGT, and I believe that their impact is very limited \u2013and often against the workers' own interests\u2013. CNT-CIT and CNT-AIT work for me, the former being bigger than the latter, but also less radical. Both accept anyone who wants to join, with the exception of \"**empresari@s, rentistas, ejecutiv@s y altos directivos, cargos pol\u00edticos, etc. Polic\u00edas, militares, seguridad privada y cuerpos represivos en general,**\u00a0por ser el brazo armado de nuestros explotadores, tampoco pueden afiliarse\". You could also join demonstrations and other acts of solidarity and direct action without being a member, and the same goes for political organizations such as the antifas. I encourage you to do some research and find what suits you best.\n\nIf you're looking exclusively for political parties, I suggest trying out the smaller ones and seeing for yourself.
