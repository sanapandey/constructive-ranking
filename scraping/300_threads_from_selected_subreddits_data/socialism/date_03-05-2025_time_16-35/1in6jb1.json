Not only is it false that capitalism rewards hard work and merit, it is an *inverse meritocracy* where the *least deserving* are rewarded. The sociopaths, the ones who actively harm people, are the ones that usually become wealthy. This means that society in general evolves to becomes more and more sociopathic and hateful. Bullying is encouraged more and more, and so is fascism. This is a dark future for all of humanity unless American-style capitalism is resisted.",

It is paradoxical as the message given to their slaves/employees is to have feelings and emotions for a humanless entity that gives 0 fucks about one's well being. And those who make it to the top of this hierarchy, fascistic by definition, are sociopathic and psychopatic.\n\nThere is a reason they are also called \"intra species predators\". A cat can't have compassion for a prey it will east but this is needed for survival. Here degenerates member of a species prey upon their own with absolutely no compassion. And those are the CEOs and Politicians that lie every word they utter from their pie holes. And unlike Ted Bundy or other notorious criminals they are not only functioning but highly successful, at the cost of society in general.",
