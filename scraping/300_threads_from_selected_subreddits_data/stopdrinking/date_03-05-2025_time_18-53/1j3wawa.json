    "selftext": "I feel better, I look better, and im really proud of myself. I can't say that im really struggling with quitting drinking, but it's been on my mind constantly. Not in the sense that im thinking about wanting to drink, but that I want to keep NOT drinking. It's more of an obsession with the task at hand if that makes sense? \n\nMy friend that's been coaching me through this keeps talking to me about the \"Ah-ha!\" moments that come as your body heals, but honestly I just feel normal? I feel like im waiting for lightning to strike. Im not at all considering going back to drinking, I want to see this through, but I have to ask: does anyone have an enlightenment moment? Like you wake up one day and it's just \"holy shit THIS is what I've been missing!\" Or is it a just a gradual thing where you realize you're actually present for those good moments?",
