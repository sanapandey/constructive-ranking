But if we just focus on the day at hand, or sometimes the next hour or the next 10 minutes, the rest will take care of itself.\n\nIt also shows the solidarity and support of the StopDrinking sub. Knowing you\u2019re not alone in your struggle with drug and alcohol addiction is extremely powerful, and to also know you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s committed to getting through the day sober can be comforting. \n\nWe\u2019re in this together.
