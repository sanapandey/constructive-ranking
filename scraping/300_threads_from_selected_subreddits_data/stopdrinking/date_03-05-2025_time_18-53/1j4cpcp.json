    "selftext": "Hello folks. Reposting this, as my previous post got 0 traction. 32 year old alcoholic here.\n\nI was pretty much a daily drinker from the first time I started drinking, nearly 10 years ago. I proceeded that way for 7+ years until I started having real health issues from my drinking. When I decided to quit, I was unable to hold food down and would be routinely vomiting. I was also drinking throughout the day, including at work. I finally had put my mind to it and stopped drinking for 429 days. I didn't go to AA, but I did join some Zoom AA meetings here and there. I also went to one on one counseling regarding my drinking for a while. Unfortunately, I did not change anything else about my life. I'm still working a job I dislike and do not work out, meditate, or have other hobbies besides video games. Initially I had relied heavily on cannabis to hold me over,  but I had eventually quit that for 6 months too. I think even though I was on a good streak, the thought of eventually drinking was always at the back of my mind.\n\nThen about 4 months ago, in mid November, I strained my neck and was at home doing nothing for a week. I found myself walking to the liquor store, despite the pain in doing so. Now 4 months later, I've been drinking nearly daily again. So far, I've been able to contain it to the evening hours. I would like to quit again, and the feeling to do so is strong throughout the day. But when I get off of work, I find myself at the liquor store, despite my conscience yelling at me. I know it's only a matter of time before the health issues start again, I mean I already wake up with some stomach pains some days. But I'm back in this cycle and part of me clearly doesn't want to stop.\n\nAnyone got advice for me?",

            "body": "You need to break that cycle. The beginning was tough for me. I had to basically do the things I didn't want to do in order to stay sober. I went to support meetings consistently for the first nine months. I didn't test myself at places where drinking was prevalent in the first several months. There were times where I just had to white knuckle it and let the moment pass. I wasn't the most pleasant person to be around at times. \n\nYou must have picked up some tools in the 429 days you were sober. Have you utilized those? Maybe try a program that they offer in the side bar of this community? \n\nIWNDWYT",

Maybe partly due to feeling some level of shame, but I think it's secretly because telling these people will mean that there will be people expecting me to be sober again. And whatever this demon inside of me that picked up the bottle after such a solid sober streak, isn't ready to let me put it down. I think I may need to attend some in-person meetings because while the online spaces are great, I think I could benefit from some more personal connections. I should probably also add exercise to my daily routine. It's a thought I've had in the back of my mind the entire first go around of sobriety,  but I never implemented it. Thank you for the reply.",

                            "body": "I relate with the whole telling people and them expecting you to be sober again. For the first year on here I didn't use the sober days counter under my name. I think I was afraid that if I mess up I would carry some shame to come back. There was another part of me that sort of felt like I had to fully commit to sobriety, even though I did when I decided to stopping drinking almost two years ago. \n\nI will say that picking one side and sticking with it, whether stopping drinking or continuing drinking, is much easier than doing both simultaneously. The last time I woke up to my apartment a complete mess AGAIN, I decided that I no longer wanted this anymore or anything related to it. Sure, since then I've had thoughts of drinking but it was just moments of me romanticizing the good times without the bad. I got through it by using the tools that I picked up to get through those tough times. \n\nI'm going through a breakup right now and it's hard. I find myself wanting to numb the pain and just check out from my brain. Just an hour ago I was romanticizing alcohol but I played the tape forward and know that the pain will be there when the alcohol wears off. I know that I'll do stupid things when I'm drinking and I'm bound to get in trouble. I know I'll feel like shit physically and mentally for giving up my sobriety. It's too much to sacrifice for just a couple hours of a buzz.",

I think I'm making this post now because I'm already feeling a back slide from the mental and physical gains I had made from quitting. I've tapped back into that instant gratification rewarding loop and have been avoiding taking any personal responsibility to stop myself from doing so.",
