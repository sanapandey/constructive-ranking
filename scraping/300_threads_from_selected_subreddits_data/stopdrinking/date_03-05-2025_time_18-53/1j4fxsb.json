    "selftext": "On July 8th, 2024 I was sitting in my car during my lunch break after drinking alcohol everyday for the past three years. There I was on the phone with my dad when I started crying about my drinking. I told my dad I really wanted to quit, I wanted to be a better mom for my daughter. I was tired of being sick and tired, letting alcohol control my every single move and thought. I remember right before quitting I had a hair appointment right after work and stopped at a liquor store and drank in the parking lot before my appointment because the thought of sitting through the appointment without booze was excruciating. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy but it has been so worth it. My anxiety was so freaking bad and today I can say that it manageable. I am a better parent today, more present, calm, happier, responsible. I have been able to focus on my health and get my finances in order, pay off debts and started therapy. My marriage is better than it was when I was drinking. I\u2019ve been able to make and actually go to doctor\u2019s appointments. I\u2019ve taken up actual hobbies like reading, cross words, walking. I\u2019ve just been able to enjoy life and the little things. My anger is under control. Quitting alcohol gave me the strength to quit nicotine and more recently weed. \n\nI\u2019m just grateful for my sobriety and this community. I am living now. Thank you all for your courage and strength! How lucky are we to have a platform to reach others struggling and to support each other, it\u2019s awesome! ",
