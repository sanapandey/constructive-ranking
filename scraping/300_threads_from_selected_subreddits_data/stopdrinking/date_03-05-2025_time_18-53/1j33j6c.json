On day 57 today. \n\nHe\u2019s the sweetest boy in the world, he\u2019s still trying to protect me cause he can sense I\u2019m anxious. \n\nThey just took him in to be sedated, run blood work and do more tests. I don\u2019t even know what the best case scenario is right now. \n\nIf folks could send prayers or positivity to him, I\u2019d appreciate that. \n\nAnd IWNDWYT. \n\nEdit: thank you so much, everyone. We are back home, safe and sound. He\u2019s got a bit of a road to recovery ahead but I\u2019m so glad to be home and sober with him. I really appreciate your thoughts and prayers for him. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\u2764\ufe0f",
