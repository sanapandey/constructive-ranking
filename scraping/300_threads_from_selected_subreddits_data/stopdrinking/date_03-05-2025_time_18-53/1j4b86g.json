    "selftext": "These monthly check ins have helped me, so paying it forward.\n\n**What I came from:**\n\n\\-Nightly mom wine time that ranged from 3 glasses of wine to 1+ bottle, more when I was pouring from the ol' box of ros\u00e9.\n\n**Why I quit:**\n\n\\-I know my drinking was 'not a lot' by some standards, but it was certainly more than the 'recommended amount'. \n\nI finally became tired of myself. \n\nTired of feeling tired and puffy faced. \n\nTired of lacking motivation during my work day. \n\nTired of numbing out during my precious time with my kids. \n\nTired of running to the store to 'grab some ingredients' when really the only ingredient I wanted was alcohol.\n\nTired of hiding wine in my room so my kids/guests/partner couldn't see how much I was drinking. \n\n*Tired of thinking I was so weak I couldn't quit.*\n\n**What's going well:**\n\n\\-I genuinely don't desire to drink anymore. When I would read people saying that when I was only a few weeks in I wanted to call them big fat liars. But it's really true, and it's possible for literally all of us. \n\n\\-When out ordering drinks with friends it's easy to grab a mocktail, and it's easier to swallow the $10-13 cost, because I know I'll truly be just having one. \n\n\\-Not distracted. I no longer plan what event I'll go to and what I will skip based on alcohol. The other night I could have ran out to an evening event that I really didn't want to go to. In the past I would have said yes just so I could grab some free drinks. Instead I am now free to check in with myself and notice what I authentically want to do.\n\n\\-My stomach is flatter and I'm seeing the results of my workouts much more. I probably only had an extra 5-10lbs on my body, but those pounds are significant and losing them makes the difference between a fit looking body, and an 'almost fit' body.\n\n\\-Cheekbones. Jawline. Bright eyes. Clear skin.\n\n  \nThat's what I have to say for this month. Thank you to all of you who share your stories and comments here. I read them every day and am so grateful for the reminder to not only be alcohol free, but in pursuit of the best life possible during this slice of a lifetime we get.\n\n",

It was when I was seeing my habits accelerating and the middle-of-the-night moments of clarity and deep guilt that made me really work on stopping. Alcoholism is in my family as well, and that\u2019s frightening. \n\nI saw this recovered alcoholic on Instagram that really made me look at myself. He said to answer these three questions if you think your drinking is getting out of control: How often? ( weekends? Everyday?  In the evenings? All day? How much?  (One or two drinks? 3 or 4? Several?) How fast are you drinking? (Are you sipping slowly or knocking them back in quick succession?) I don\u2019t know..this resonated with me. I had to face that I was on my way to a big problem that I would soon be unable to control.\n\nI\u2019m happy for your progress and find it inspiring \ud83d\udc4f.",
