I then proceeded to ignore all the warnings my body was sending me and decided to start something important anyway.\n\nSo as expected, I made a very dumb mistake, which resulted in losing my entire afternoon, and my work day tomorrow will also be dedicated to fixing what went wrong. \n\nI make a lot less mistakes now that I'm sober. But it still happens. Don't be me : accept that some days, we gonna be stoopid. And it's ok. Sobriety won't make us superheroes. \n\nJust cracked opened a NA beer to ease the frustration. Let's focus on not making anymore mistakes today. Drinking would be a huge one.\n\nVent over, byeee",

But what I\u2019m also expecting is that I\u2019ll be able to handle and recover from my mistakes a lot more productively and without panic because I\u2019ll be of a clear sober mind. Sobriety doesn\u2019t make us super heroes but it definitely makes us a lot more capable of handling difficult situations! IWNDWYT.",
