    "selftext": "I\u2019m (33m) a year sober.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, it\u2019s not been easy but it\u2019s also not been that hard. In the sense that I really was so unwell. 24/7 drinker, physically I was ruined, mentally and emotionally destroyed.\n\nI couldn\u2019t get sober for the week or two requirement to get into a suicide prevention facility - couldn\u2019t stop drinking for a single day - and ended up in rehab. Relapsed out of rehab and another suicidal moment (blacked out in bed with razor blades) 10 days later.\n\nThen I just did the work, day by day, and I got better. I\u2019m not gonna harp on about 12 step recovery - because I get people can get well different ways - but for me it\u2019s totally transformed my life.\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling right now, I promise you it can and will get better if you put everything into your path for recovery. I am the worst of us, I really am right up there. But now I\u2019m so happy and life is better than it\u2019s ever been.\n\nIf I can do it, anyone can. Be kind to yourself, take it one day at a time, be patient and work on yourself.\n\nMuch love!",

If so, your gift to yourself is a gift to me, and maybe others here, to learn from you and your experience, BEFORE it gets that bad, cause maybe it just could, for some of us.\n\nThank you deeply.\n\nIWNDWYToday\n\nLove.",
