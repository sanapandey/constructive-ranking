    "selftext": "38 days free of booze and I have never felt better and proud of myself in the last decade than I do now.\n\nI'm in Australia, specifically Brisbane, Queensland and if you haven't seen the news recently, we are expecting to have our first cyclone (hurricane) directly hit our city since 1990 and it has been an immensely stressful time for almost everyone in our city, me included.\n\n2 months ago, if something stressful like this was occurring, I would have been downing wine like it was medication for a coma patient, but in a way, this incoming event has made me realise how much easier life is to deal with without alcohol.\n\nNormally I would be apathetic to the news that there was a potential that my house could have its roof taken off of it or have it flood but all throughout the past 48 hours I have been preparing non-stop with a level of drive that I once would only imagine of. \n\nThank you r/stopdrinking for your help with me finding a way out of my drinking purgatory and back into a sober life. \n\nEveryone stay safe out there, I will not be drinking with you tonight.",

I'm so proud of you.\n\nAs a quick but relevant side note; as someone who grew up in Florida in the U.S.A for the first 20 years of their life, where hurricanes of any category are both a regular and expected occurrence, follow all the necessary precautions that are being put in place, and then some. Hell, I'd recommend even googling Florida hurricane prep news articles, since it's basically professional standards at this point lol. Better to be over-prepared than under. And if you haven't already, pack a go-bag (clothes, toiletries, snacks, etc.), and make sure to get any important documents and things in another bag, just in case you have to pick up and leave in a blink. Even Floridians make those mistakes (of not doing it) and it can cause even more problems down the line in the worst case scenarios.\n\nStay safe, to both you and your city.\n\nIWNDWYT \ud83e\udd0d",
