I tried to fix it and I think I made it worse, my bad)\n\n- I'm forever envious of those who are able to lose weight immediately after quitting. I'm probably making up for the missing calories plus some in carbs lately, I'll probably get heavier if I keep this up tbh. Which is upsetting because I'm already technically \"obese\" and really would like to lose weight, but right now it's either alcohol or pasta so \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\n\n\n- My sex drive is absolutely non existent. For one reason or another, I've always struggled with the idea of having sex while sober. This week isn't much different, except now even when I'm high (I still take edibles, the world sucks too much right now for me to be 100% sober) there's practically nothing there. This does actually upset me some, as I have a really high libido naturally. I hope this changes the longer I'm comfortable without drinking. Thankfully my partner's hardly sexual at all so it's not impacting anything in that regard at least. \n\n\n\n- Every time I feel like I'm craving a drink, I realize that I don't actually want a drink, I just want something to do. Boredom is a huge trigger for me, and taking shots in the kitchen while making dinner or in my bedroom while watching TV has just become a regular habit over the last couple years. However, the idea of taking shots, or even tasting vodka in any capacity, makes me feel sick. I don't know if I could even swallow it if I tried now. I won't try, obviously. But still. \n\n\n\n- I'm so, so, so, so tired. 24/7 sleepiness. I've never wanted to sleep more in my whole 24 years of life lol \n\n\n\nHowever, I have absolutely 0 regrets in trying sobriety this time around. I'm so happy to no longer have two day long hangovers, no longer making myself throw up during a binge just so I could \"afford\" two or three more shots. I'm so happy to no longer get into such dramatic and explosive arguments with the love of my life and be too fucked up to even remember what the argument is about. I don't miss working my customer facing job while sick out of my mind, or constantly worrying about if I smell like booze or not. \n\n\nThis isn't my first attempt at sobriety, far from. But this is the first attempt I've had that actually feels hopeful and realistic. I wanted to get myself a slice of cheesecake to celebrate one week but I'm broke lol so maybe I'll get that slice at the one month mark. But for now, one day at a time and IWNDWYT ",
