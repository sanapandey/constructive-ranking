    "selftext": "I am still sober (24 days now) and we have been working on our marriage, and things were going very well (so I thought). We have been married for 4 years in 2 weeks. He told me yesterday that he wants to divorce me still, and he cannot convince himself that I am capable of being sober long term or being okay with me. We have been through a lot of things with mental health, and my rock bottom was 2 years ago/1 year ago when I went to rehab(2x). I haven\u2019t stopped trying to be sober and working through my mental health issues. I have a therapist that cares now, I am more confident in my sobriety, and I am stronger than I ever was. I have taken accountability for all of my actions, I have put my ego aside, made a lot of sacrifices for our marriage and for my mental health. I have made a lot of mistakes and I have realized that being sober is what is best for me. I love him very much and I can\u2019t hate him. I don\u2019t have anything bad to say about him. I\u2019m losing my best friend and my husband. I don\u2019t even have a desire to drink right now, and I just feel broken. \n\nJust yesterday, he said he wanted to work this out with me, that he would be with me no matter what as long as I allow him to be as my husband, not even 2 minutes later when I was processing this information was when he read me a letter he typed titled \u2018goodbye\u2019. I am not gonna type the whole letter out, but it was painful and really hard to listen to. I tried to reason with him but he said to me that he wouldn\u2019t let me talk him out of divorce again, even though he realized that he wants to be with me anyways. I just need comfort and I guess support. I don\u2019t want to lose him but I think it\u2019s too late. IWDWYT. ",

            "body": "First of all let me say I'm sorry you are going through this. It would be nice to have support, especially when you are going through early sobriety. It's heartbreaking when our partner wants to walk a different path than us, especially when we could use some help.\n\nMaybe he's scared of getting his hopes up and being let down? Maybe he's afraid you will actually change and leave him behind?\n\nOne thing I have learned on this sub is \"I am not responsible for what someone else says, does, thinks or feels\". I had to concentrate on my sobriety and recovery, sometimes at the expense of losing relationships. You can't control how he feels, you can only control yourself.\n\nMaybe he ends up leaving, maybe he leaves and comes back, maybe he changes his mind again tomorrow. The only thing you can control is not drinking today. And I'm so proud of you for doing that in spite of this hardship. Keep taking it one day at a time and making a new life for yourself.\n\nI will not drink with you today",

But regardless of what happened, I needed to be my strongest, healthiest self when the time came. So i commited to staying sober, getting a new job, new therapist, new apartment. Essentially build a new life after 10 years.\n\nSix months later i was blessed that she reconsidered. But only because i made myself the focus, i did things for me, not us. And that was the only way she could know it wasn't codependency or bargaining.\n\nI hope you can stay strong. Regardless of the outcome, you'll need your best self going forward. Good luck",
