We were hosting a watch party and by the end of the night I had a nasty fight with my wife and woke up to my bed sheets completely soiled. I decided than and there i was done. Its been so nice having energy and motivation throughout the day. And I've dropped 15 pounds! From drinking 6+ 8.0% IPA's a night to zero. Anyways. Just wanted to share! IWNDWYT",
