    "selftext": "It\u2019s already 8pm where I am and with such a busy day, I almost completely forgot!\n\nOn March 4, 2024 I took control of my life and said I would stop drinking and do the work to be sober. I am here! I made it! 1 year down. \n\nTo be honest I don\u2019t even think about drinking. It\u2019s been so long now that it doesn\u2019t cross my mind and I have zero problems being around people who are drinking. I cringe at the thought of even sipping it - it almost brings me to a point of immediate nausea and / or reminds me of all the times I spent throwing up and laying on my bathroom floor. \n\nIn the last year I have finished my first ultra marathon (50 mile race) and become an ambassador for a very notable trail running brand. I have been offered a promotion at work. I moved into a townhome with a garage and I bought a new truck. \n\nI feel so incredibly blessed for what sobriety has given me. \n\n\u201cI dedicated myself to sobriety and God told me that I would be rewarded and that I would see just how good it can get\u201d -Doechii (accepting her Grammy this year)\n\nHappy 1 year or 1 hour or 1 day or whatever it looks like for you. Sending lots of love to everyone ",
