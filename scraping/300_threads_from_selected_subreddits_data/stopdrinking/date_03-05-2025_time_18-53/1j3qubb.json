    "selftext": "Been mentally not great today. Been off the sauce since 1/12. Had a great success this past weekend, surrounded by heavy drinkers, drinking games, cocktails, beer, wine etc, I even tasted a cocktail, but I did not drink! I had one THC seltzer each night, and took a gabapentin on Sat as well, so not totally sober, but being basically immersed in drinking culture, & I had a fabulous time, which I think is a big success. \n\nBut today I want to escape. I don\u2019t want to feel these negative feelings. I have a very dire outlook towards the future and hell, the present is getting pretty damn terrifying as a United Stadian.  \n\nAlso I didn\u2019t buy ice cream at the store earlier, cause I feel like I\u2019ve been gaining weight. Boo, all I have are these healthy fruit popsicles. I\u2019m just so sad. Everything is so fucking sad. \nI feel helpless, powerless & hopeless. \nI feel isolated and alienated and I hate the culture I\u2019m a part of. Hate hate hate.\n\nRant over.\n",
