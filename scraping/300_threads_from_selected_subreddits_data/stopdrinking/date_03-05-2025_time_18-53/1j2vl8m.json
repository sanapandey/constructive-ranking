    "selftext": "I told myself I was done two months ago. I went out with some old coworkers last night. We used to work at a restaurant that has a bar and it was common for people to buy us drinks after our shift. I was a little worried about the reception from my friends and the regulars but everyone was really nice and no one tried to pressure me to \"just have one\". They offered to buy me food instead! Deliciously cold water for me all night and no feelings of regret this morning! I'm now confident that I can keep doing this! IWNDWYT!!!",
