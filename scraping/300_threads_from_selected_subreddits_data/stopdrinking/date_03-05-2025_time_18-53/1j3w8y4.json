    "selftext": "hey everyone. i\u2019ve lurked on here for a long time, but i feel like i might as well be apart of it. i (24F) have actively dealt with addiction for about 5 years now, and it has completely ruined my life. i used to be in college and in nursing school- now i don\u2019t recognize myself. i\u2019ve been to rehab 3 times in 4 years, arrested once in 2022, even broke my leg last june bc i fell while drunk. this is not who i am. the thing is, i\u2019ve tried everything i know to do. i am once again in my first couple months, i\u2019ve had longer stints in the past (14 months was my longest)- so i know it\u2019s possible. i guess i\u2019m looking for tips on how to make the most of my life sober. i have never really connected with AA as much as i wish i did- but again i\u2019m willing to try.\nthank you:) \n",
