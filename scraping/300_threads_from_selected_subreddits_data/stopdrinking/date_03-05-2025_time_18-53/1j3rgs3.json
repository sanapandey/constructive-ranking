A lot of the time I've kept it to myself because I don't want to give them added pressure.\n\nIf you'd like to share, what's your experience of telling your parents? Or even being a parent hearing this?\n\nI know everyone's experience will be different taking circumstances into account but I dunno what to do and I feel like I'm at rockbottom or close. \n\nThank you.",

Just be honest with them- try not to worry about making it \"a thing\" or increasing their anxiety- now is the time to focus on you. It's impossible to predict how they'll react without knowing the relationship you have with them, but If they love you, they'll be relieved you're being honest and will only want to help. They may ask how they can help- be honest that you don't/may not know the answer to that yet. It will likely be emotional, but that's ok. \n\nMy parents knew I had a problem before I did. Their sense of relief when I finally realized it and became willing to accept help was palpable. Even through my (many) relapses since then, they've been nothing but supportive and loving. I hope your experience is similar to mine.\n\nAdmitting it is the first step- just be as open and honest as you can. Best of luck- you can do the hard things!",

It also gave me more accountability.\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy conversation to lead up to, but for me it was so worth it. \nI don\u2019t live in the same city as my parents, so I think it was also a relief for them - they knew I had a drinking problem so for me to acknowledge it and ask for help was better than worrying sick about me all the time. \n\nI hope you also find relief when you tell them.
