It wasn\u2019t a conscious choice but I usually found myself in the company of heavy drinkers. It was good cover and an excuse to stay out later to drink more. Most people in my life were either too caught up in their own issues, too polite or too smart to get into it with me. It\u2019s not like I made it easy or was going to admit to anything anyways. I don\u2019t blame anyone for not trying to say anything but I took it as a sign that I was getting away with it. Now, I can spot a drink on someone a mile away and I\u2019m sure I deal with drunk people the same way they dealt with me: smile, nod and bounce. That may also attribute to how I seemed to find myself with other drinkers. Less judgement and more bullshit. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting that whats helped me the most is being around other alcoholics in recovery. There is a real connection there from shared experiences and I don\u2019t feel the need to hide, pretend or bullshit. It can go either way but now I really don\u2019t have much of a reserve to deal with big drinkers. It has nothing to do with them, it\u2019s just embarrassing to be reminded of how fucking stupid I acted. How I believed I was living some secret double life is beyond me but I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not pretending anymore",

I do not hang out with people in active addiction. I don't need that influence in my life.\n\nOr, are you asking if I hang out with other alcoholics who are working on recovery? Absolutely. The fellowship of recovery is supportive and fun. Having sober buddies on speed dial is essential if I get triggered. That's why I go to meetings. Fellowship and support.",
