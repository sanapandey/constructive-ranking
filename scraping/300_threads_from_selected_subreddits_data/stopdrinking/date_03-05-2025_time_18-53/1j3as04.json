    "selftext": "About 3 or 4 days a week I am in the pub. I love the pub atmosphere, the drinks at the pub and it feels like home to me. \n\nThe issue I have with this obsession, is it affects my sobriety goals because going into pubs makes sobriety a lot more difficult than staying clear of them. Also even alcohol aside, pubs are very expensive these days and that\u2019s another issue that came from this obsession.\n\nIf I was to ask myself why I am obsessed with pubs, I would say I have been socialised to. My father took me in the pub every single day I grew up with him, even when I was 4 years old. I would drink soft drinks but I was taken in the pub every single day of my childhood I spent with him, unless he was broke or hungover. On my mothers side of the family, my mum never went to the pub but her father did and I used to go to the pub sometimes after school and have a few soft drinks. Even at age 10, I would get disappointed if I wasn\u2019t allowed to go to the pub to see my grandad. At school I would say to other children and teachers when I grow up I want to own my own pub. \nAt age 15 my father moved a 4 hour drive away from me so I visited the pub less because of this. \n\nThen came the alcohol. At age 16 in the UK, you can have an alcoholic drink with a meal. I tried this a few times but generally preferred to drink coca cola back at that age because I didnt like the taste of lager back then. Plus I wasn\u2019t that bothered about getting drunk. Being drunk seemed like it was a nuisance. \n\nAt age 18 I was allowed to drink alcohol in pubs without needing to eat a meal and be accompanied by an adult. Also instead of going to the pub with my grandad, I was 18 and my friends were too so I could see them at the pub. However one month later Covid-19 lockdowns started so pubs were pretty much shut for a year. I was pretty much alcohol free during the lockdowns apart from the brief periods we were allowed to see friends and so I had some canned lagers at the park a few times. \n\nPubs reopened and I had saved up a lot of money during Covid by not going out anywhere. I visited the pub at least once a week accompanied by another day of the week smashing cans of lager at a friends house. When seeing my grandad, lager replaced soft drinks at the pub.\n\nThe yearly visit to see my alcoholic father was always be in the pub every single one of those 14 days I spent with him. By his choice because any suggestion about going to the beach or doing something else would result in him moaning and unwilling to do that. But going to a new area to go to new pubs he was fine with. Most importantly he wanted to spend most of the time in his dusty rundown local pub. \n\nFast forward to 2024 and I got permanently banned from my friends house by his mother for being a very badly behaved drunk. That meant we could now only drink together at my house or the pub. However my house is a lot smaller and less ideal than his so we stuck to drinking in pubs. I noticed I was spending more money than I was earning mainly due to my pub habit. \n\nPubs became a hobby. I would hit up my friend and say lets spend this Saturday going into London and trying new pubs we have never drank at before. This became a monthly occurrence. I loved the vibe of being drunk in a nice overpriced London pub on a Saturday night. I loved the decor and vibe to a lot of these London pubs. \n\nI loved the pub in the summer, I loved the pub in the winter, I loved the pub when the sun sets at 4PM, I loved the pub when the sun sets at 10PM, in the rain I loved the pub and on a sunny day I loved the pub. \n\nA hard day at work couldn\u2019t be rewarded unless it was a cozy evening with some drinks at a nice pub with a friend. \n\nDuring the times I was heavily against alcohol, I would still go to the pub, I would order non alcoholic drinks and still have a good time. But even these NA beers would ruin my wallet. \n\nIf no one was around on a Friday or Saturday night, I would call an uber and travel to a new pub I hadn\u2019t been to before and have 3-5 drinks and have a good time. Expensive but I am in a brand new pub right? \n\nUltimately I believe this obsession is linked to my childhood time spent in pubs. It is also heavily linked to alcohol as alcohol is addictive and the main part of pubs is the alcohol. My biggest challenge is the pub because if I quit going to pubs, I am 90% of the way there because I never drink at my home. Im not the kind of drinker who cracks open a beer at home after work. Since being banned from my friends house in early 2024, every single alcohol beverage I have consumed has been inside of a pub which is crazy to think. There is some huge link for me between pubs and alcohol. I never go clubbing because I am not the biggest fan of the clubbing vibe. ",

In my experience, alcohol free beers have not been much cheaper. On a typical night at the pub I will buy about 6-8 pints of Madri lager for about \u00a36.50 per pint. On my alcohol free nights at the pub I will buy two bottles of Peroni 0.0 and pour them into a Madri glass (to make me feel like I am having a Madri). These peroni bottles are 330ml and cost \u00a34.65 per bottle. Per pint that works out to be \u00a38.00. I drink less of them but thats more because my sober mind cant justify me spending that much on beer but my drunk mind doesn\u2019t care.

If you go Fridays and Saturdays, your budget per visit is 25\u00a3. Only spend cash at the pub; no digital payments. Say you have 30\u00a3 left at the end of the month, roll it over and only take out 170\u00a3, so you're topping back up to 200\u00a3. The money you're saving can go towards a vacation, or a down payment on a house, or any number of things that aren't booze. Maybe even towards owning your own pub with fantastic food and only NA drinks?",

In that time I've been in the pub no fewer than 5 times, once on my own to watch the football and 4 times with my wife or with friends.\u00a0\n\n\nPersonally, and we can only ever speak for our own experience, I've enjoyed the company as much as I always have, and have been on the Brooklyn 0% lagers which are as good as an alcoholic pint. I've found the atmosphere a little different though, everything is a little louder and slightly less welcoming without having the edge taken off by a couple of pints.\n\n\nWhere am I going with this, then? Well 2 places I suppose. Firstly, if you still enjoy the pub, nobody is stopping you! I wanted to share my experience of still enjoying the pub whilst sober. But, if you find your enjoyment waning, are there other third spaces you could make use of which serve a similar social function, perhaps the beach, or a picnic in a local park?\n\n\nWishing you all the best.",

            "body": "Therapist here. This is just like someone who can\u2019t lose weight because they have an obsession with sweets due to sweets being linked in their mind to a happy time in childhood with a parent. Yes, sweets taste good and the majority of people love them for that reason, but what the person actually saw subconsciously every time they saw a piece of cake in a bakery or opened up a pint of ice cream, was love from mom or dad. They craved the connection that came from going to the ice cream shop with mom or the bakery with dad, sitting on his lap and eating cake.\n\nThis is so deeply programmed during childhood that they end up using the sweets to fill a subconscious void of wanting to connect to others and feel love and acceptance. Rationally they know that this is bad for them and causes unwanted health issues if they don\u2019t stop, yet they keep doing it because it fills an emotional need. \n\nWhen this really clicks, they realize that as adults, they can heal the unhealthy association between the \u201cthing\u201d and the \u201cfeeling\u201d they want, and it becomes pretty easy to stop the behavior. \n\nAs adults we can learn new ways to feel that love and connection we crave in childhood by loving ourselves and finding healthy environments and behaviors that align with our values *now*. The key is to know you\u2019re not losing anything by leaving old associations behind, because what they represent to you is a feeling, and the feeling can be found in many places and many ways. \n\nThrough curiosity and excitement for all the potential you have for a great life ahead, try out new places and behaviors that make you feel happy and connected to yourself and others who care. May feel really weird at first, but keep with it until you find something that makes you come alive! I hope this helps",

I know when I go now I'll be ordering a non alcoholic beer and I'm used to it and looked forward to it!\n\nnot every alcoholic can go to bars and be okay so you have to see what's right for you, but it's not a trigger for me at all these days. I order my NA beer the second I sit down and don't even think about ordering something else. I also put it in a glass so I don't have to see the 0 percent and people dont mention it.
