However it didn't work out that way. I didn't really feel good at all and drank too much till black out. The next day i couldn't get out of bed and was mentally unwell for at least a week. So it's up to you but if your mind is talking you into thinking you will have a good time then just know that that is not necessarily going to be the case.",

            "body": "I used to think boredom was a form of punishment. When in reality it's the best motivator to get me of my butt and go experience life. And not just the good fun things, but challenging things, even failures to learn from to get better at. However at some point in my life I got the taste of effortless dopamine via ethanol. And suddenly I felt alive, felt like everything was great, and I was living life to the fullest. And over decades of drinking, I did nothing but sit at bars, get drunk every weekend, and mainly focus on activities that involved get drunk (not having a drink and enjoying my time).\n\nCravings is just brain asking for dopamine in ways it knows how. Also it doesn't help that the brain is very good at evaluating which is the most optimal way to get large amounts of dopamine while doing the least amount of work. And alcohol is a perfect substance to flood my brain with dopamine, while I do absolutely nothing. It makes boring things fun, makes annoying people seem amazing, and that dopamine works by making me believe that it was the correct choice. \n\nWhen I quit, I thought my life was over and I'd just sit at home and re-watch The Office for the billionth time. But then I thought about it. What would I be doing if alcohol was never a part of my life? Would I be just chain smoking, while sitting in my room starting at a wall? I don't think so. So then I just let the natural curiosity drive me, during COVID I got into 3d printing, gold panning (pay dirt) and eventually once they lifted \"quarantine\" I got into motocamping, photography, and eventually started running to the point that I ran the LA Marathon which evolved into me running an ultra. I started running at 37, as a smoker. \n\nIn past 5 years I have experienced more life than I have in over 20 years of drinking. My schedule is so busy that I crave a moment of time where I get to be bored. And when I get there, I usually get up and go for a run. It's as if the runners high is my dopamine source, so now my brain craves that route instead of thinking about drinking.\n\nIWNDWYT",

When I look back at what I did in the past year, I don\u2019t want it to be that I mostly just sat on my couch or a bar thinking I was doing fun things and realize I actually did a whole lot of nothing. I want it to be full of trying new hobbies, accomplishing goals I never thought possible, and exploring new places that aren\u2019t within the 4 walls of a bar or my living room. For me so far in my short stint of sobriety, that\u2019s looked like me finally enrolling in a program for a group fitness instructor certification, trying out hot Pilates for the first time, and having some of my best laps on the mountain skiing. Thank you so much for sharing your story and inspiring me today!",
