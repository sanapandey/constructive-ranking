    "selftext": "I drank a lot for like 20yrs. About 7-10 beers a day everyday and I drank for a variety reasons and a lot of them seem to be common. I was unhappy with myself, where I was at in life and I had debilitating anxiety and very bad depression. \n\nSo I used to drink when I was anxious which tbh that did help a bit but I never realized how much it was much worse it was making it.\n\nAnd I drank when I was depressed knowing it\u2019d make it worse but I didn\u2019t care I wanted to feel bad anyway. I was a classic self loathing drunk. \n\nWell today isn\u2019t going well and I\u2019m far enough along in my recovery where I dont want to drink to cope with my depression and anxiety. The only time I\u2019ve thought about it was when I noticed I wasn\u2019t tempted to grab a beer.\n\nAnd I\u2019m proud of this. I\u2019ve been intentional about not drinking and I\u2019ve had the belief that if I stick with it there will be some worthwhile award. And this is one of those.\n\nSince December I have 63 days sober according to my  journal. So not perfect sure but I\u2019ve stuck with it through the bad days and have known I no longer wanted alcohol to play a role in my life.\n\nI may be a lot of things but I was determined to no longer be a drunk and not drinking to cope with negative emotions has been a significant part of that.

Either for a cope or to have fun with friends. I\u2019m learning I can do just fine without it now. Congrats on your recovery.

I want to break those neural pathways.\n\nI had an abusive childhood and don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever experienced happiness, so when I first swiped a bottle of booze at 12 or 13, I mistook that feeling for happiness, and haven\u2019t been able to break the habitual drinking since.\n\nI\u2019m not drinking myself to death anymore, but I\u2019m definitely a \u2018high functioning\u2019 alcoholic. It\u2019s pretty much every day.\n\nGood on you!",
