    "selftext": "Edit: for context I initially wanted to stop drinking for good (after 7 years of problematic drinking) on January 6th and I had 24, 1, 10, 8 and now 10 consecutive days alcohol free, so it\u2019s safe to say I\u2019m still struggling but I really want this and as I said in my last post this time feels easier) \n\nSorry for spamming this group, but it\u2019s so helpful. I started smoking nearly 15 years ago but was a social smoker (not everyday, only with others). Now that I stopped drinking I smoke so much, even alone, even in the morning, even two cigarettes directly after the other. I told myself it\u2019s fine, on thing at a time, but it\u2019s not really true as one addiction got way worse after I quit the other. Any help would be greatly appreciated in how to go from here! Thank you \u263a\ufe0f ",

Some used smoking as a coping mechanism others just cut it all out entirely because they didn\u2019t want to replace one addiction with another.\n\nI am not a smoker myself so I don\u2019t really know which is the better path but I can at least say both can work.",
