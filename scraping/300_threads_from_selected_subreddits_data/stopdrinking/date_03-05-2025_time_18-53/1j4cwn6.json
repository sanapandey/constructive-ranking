    "selftext": "I always justify my drinking. I always find a way to let this thing destroy me. \n\nRecently I have become a lot more active, back in the gym, deadlifting and eating a lot more in order to get strong. \n\nIt allowed me to reframe my drinking as not a big deal. It's just a few extra calories.... A few beers here, no problem! Heck I haven't even had a hangover in a while!\n\nBut, I am drinking more than ever. My mental health is down the pan, my obsessive thoughts are killing me. It's insidious..... It finds a way to adapt and dominate. \n\nPlease guys and gals. Did you ever get back in the gym and keep on drinking? Did it ever allow you to justify more alcohol? How do I break free from this? I know it is tied into testosterone and sexuality. ",

            "body": "A little different, but running was my bargaining tool. 15 beers? I\u2019ll run 15 miles tomorrow. The truth is that alcohol hinders gains and fitness. Like a shitload. I *always* used running as an excuse to drink more. It never paid off.\u00a0\n\nOnce I quit drinking, I got astronomically better at running and my fitness skyrocketed. I fell in love with it all over again in a brand new way. My running is also tied in a bit with disordered eating and severe body dysmorphia, so I get the multi-faceted aspect of what you\u2019re experiencing.\u00a0\n\nI broke free by accepting that I could not quit by myself and I asked for help. I asked anyone who I thought could get me off the sauce. And I got help and it stuck with me, because I brought others into the fold. I met a lot of really great sober people and having that support makes sobriety easy and liberating.\u00a0\n\nWithout booze, your body will thank and repay you in spades.\u00a0",

I blew blood vessels in my eyes. \n\nNow, when I quit drinking and got serious in the gym, that's when the gains came. Being swole feels better than any drink tastes. Plus, people don't question why I don't drink. They can see the transformation.  \n\n>I know it is tied into testosterone and sexuality.\n\nThere's also a ton more to learn.",
