    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m once again on a mission to de-alcohol my life. I read this post https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/s/RulnqGkVwA yesterday, and seeing how much I related to so many peoples\u2019 symptoms inspired me. So I made a list of every single symptom I\u2019ve been dealing with lately, including both physical and mental health symptoms. I\u2019m curious to see which symptoms go away once I\u2019m farther away from my most recent drink. I\u2019m only on day 2 at the moment so I think there will be lots to discover as time goes on! Has anyone else ever done this? If so, I\u2019d love to hear about it! ",
