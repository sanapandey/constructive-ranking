    "selftext": "I (17f) have been drinking about 400ml of vodka or a 12 pack of beer/seltzers everyday for the last 2 years. There was a point last year that I joined the program, and became sober for about 2 months because of the constant support from my group. Everyone was all over me trying to help because I was so young (15 at my first meeting). I then had a pretty terrible breakup with my boyfriend(25m) who constantly wanted me to be or act like an adult when legally I am not even one. I became very depressed and stopped going anywhere, even the meetings. Ever since then I haven\u2019t stopped drinking. The sole reason I wanted to get sober was for my boyfriend. (We got back together a month ago) I have recently been scared about my health. I have been having horrible repeating pains in my right upper abdomen, I have also been having frequent stomach pains and am constantly feeling nauseous, sometimes throwing up. I\u2019ve played hockey my whole life, and only recently in the last few months I\u2019ve noticed I have many bruises on my body, which has never happened before. Any physical activity I do ends up with my body full of bruises, even if I didn\u2019t think I hurt my self. I know this is a lot, but I am at a loss right now and really need some help.  ",

This is \"real doctor\" territory and possibly \"real therapist\" territory.\n\nIt isn't really the sup to get into this on but a 15 year old drinking and dating a 23 year old and having physical pains in WAY outside of normal, even for us.\n\nWe care, but this is above our pay grade",

Please, reach out to your parents or another trusted adult for help. You're far too young to deal with this alone, and asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Medical supervision is crucial for your physical and mental health. Once you're receiving proper care, incorporating holistic practices like exercise and yoga can be incredibly beneficial, but these should be done with guidance. You absolutely can overcome this, and you deserve to be healthy and happy.",
