But does the sneak usually refer to the effects of alcohol coming on someone in a moment in time like a binge, or drinking too much over many years, or the literal try to hide one\u2019s alcohol or alcoholism, or something else? Alcoholism runs deep in my family, but never heard about the \u201csneak\u201d ",

I can\u2019t tell you when each transition happened, but it did. Alcohol lowered my inhibitions slowly, until eventually the only way I could function was with a drink in me. Once I was at that point I was entirely physically dependent on alcohol and had to drink to ward off withdrawals. \n\nIt took me over 15 years to get to that point\u2014 the vast majority of that time I wouldn\u2019t have considered myself to have a drinking problem. Sneaky.",

It started with a few wines out with friends and then I quickly ended up in a place where I was drinking a bottle a day starting in the morning before I knew it. I got to a place where drinking was normalized and I kept drinking more and more until I realized I was digging deeper and deeper. But I kept rationalizing it by saying it wasn\u2019t as bad as other people, or that I was drinking the same amount as my peers, or I needed it for social anxiety. It definitely felt like it snuck up on me and I lost control while telling myself I was in control.",

When I do, its frequently sneaky. On a day where I'm feeling good and nothing remarkable is happening. Then the thought just creeps in out of nowhere, like it was hiding somewhere in my memory.
