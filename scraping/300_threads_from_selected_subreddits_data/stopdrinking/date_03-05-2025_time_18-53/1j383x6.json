    "selftext": "I\u2019m so angry with myself. I stopped drinking 30th September 2024, and made it alllll the way to 31st December. 94 days. I thought I was cured. I didn\u2019t even think of alcohol anymore. Went to numerous parties over Christmas, birthdays, funerals, loads of occasions and ordered water with no issue. \nMy father in law gave me a beer New Year\u2019s Eve, and I decided to drink it because \u20182025 will be a sober year, so here\u2019s one last one\u2019\nFast forward 2 months, I\u2019ve gone straight back into my old ways. Drinking every day after work, hiding in the garden so my Mrs doesn\u2019t see me downing the wine. \nThe health issues I previously fixed have come back. I feel unhealthy and look tired all the time. \nToday is my birthday, and when I set a date to quit, I find it helps so, I want my new age to be a sober one. My mother in law has bought me cans for my birthday, but I\u2019ve already decided who I\u2019m going to give them to in work. \nI need to stop drinking forever, but most importantly, I won\u2019t drink today",
