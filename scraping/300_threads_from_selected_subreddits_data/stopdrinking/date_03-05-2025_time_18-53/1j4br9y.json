    "selftext": "Title, it was easy for me tbh. I never really enjoyed drinking. When I am sober, I am already \"free\" or low inhibition (in a good way) or without worries that need escaping from, or at least I can deal with my problems in my own sober head. I'd only drink at parties, social events etc, one time I decided to drink alone and it just felt depressing. When I would drink at parties sure I would get drunk but I would actually tense up (idk why, anyone else have this happen and know why? Maybe the parties just sucked lol). So yeah, where I live alcohol is drank more than water and it's embedded in it's tradition and culture. Nothing against people that drink, if you can control it and wanna have a good time every now and then so be it, but everyone around me seems addicted? \n\nEvery weekend or every few days they go out to the club and wobble around like penguins with fake smiles, fake attitudes, trying to release their \"demons\". I think clubbing is pathetic tbh, or drinking in general. I think the only reason as to why it's so common is because people cannot relax while sober or \"let go\" or be \"free\" or \"loose\" while sober so they rely on alcohol, further reinforcing the habit in their brains. Every \"clubber\" or drinker I know, when sober, seems to be out of it or not really there like they have problems, they can't look me in the eye and they just seem off.\n\nWhat are your experiences with alcohol?",
