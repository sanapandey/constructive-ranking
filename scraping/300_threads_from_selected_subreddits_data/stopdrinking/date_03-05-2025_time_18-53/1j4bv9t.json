    "selftext": "I needed to go to the supermarket today and the thing I needed to buy was literally right next to beers. I said fuck it, bought a pack of cheese and beef jerky and devoured them like there is no tomorrow.  Normally I would definitely go for the beer because \"it is more healthy than unhealthy snacks\" but reality is if I start drinking i will not stop at the healthy limit. I will drink to get drunk ans I am sure it is not more healthy. Anyways, this was todays adventure. IWNDWYT.",
