    "selftext": "a few months ago me and my boyfriend got into a fight. i was downtown drunk with my friends when i got the bright idea to go to his car and slash his tires. i drove 45 minutes there (drinking more on the way). but when i got there, no knife. only an itty bitty show knife on my keychain. well i didn\u2019t come here for nothing. i went to his tire and tried digging the knife in only to look down and realize that not only was the blade in the wrong direction, but i had been sawing through my finger. there was blood all over his car, tires, dripping down my arm, and a pool at my feet. couldn\u2019t feel a thing. as i walked back to my car, i thought, i cant just not finish the job! i turned back to try for more but was, obviously, unsuccessful. i drenched an entire towel trying to stop the bleeding. i went home to make a sandwich and go to bed, unknowingly bleeding all over my sandwich, my mom walked in and freaked out. i told her it was fine and to go to bed. i woke up with little memory, and instead of praising to god i made it home safe i wanted to drink off the pain of my odd finger wound. (i needed stitches and still have no feeling in my finger) \n\nshortly after i was getting drunk at work (bartender) and of course i blacked out nearly my entire shift. at the end of my shift i lost my keys and couldn\u2019t find them. my phone was on 2% so i couldn\u2019t call an uber and nobody was answering the phone. i was prepared to sleep outside my car when i noticed a customer in the parking lot. he was passed out in the front seat. i knocked on his window and asked if i could drive myself home in his car. he said yes. no idea how i made it back but i did. i walked in, my hands bleeding from cutting myself at work on accident, no bandaids or anything (gross). he said i had completely lost it. i told him to get out of my house or mind his business. we fought all night and then i called out of work the next morning because i was too sick. a couple days later i was fired. i worked there for less than 3 months. my boyfriend wouldn\u2019t take care of me and i was so upset with him. couldn\u2019t he see i was a victim? its not my fault i had a problem. but it is my responsibility. i drank a few times after that, racking up some days and then relapsing. then went through the whole maybe i can drink responsibly phase. \n\ni\u2019m going to aa every day. just picked up my chip. god is in my life again. i never want to have to deal with drunk me\u2019s consequences ever again. my birthday is on monday and i can not be grateful enough that i will be spending it sober.
