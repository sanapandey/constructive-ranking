    "selftext": "The hardest part of my sobriety has been the admission to myself that I am an alcoholic. Some days, I still struggle with the idea. I\u2019m young! In 10 years I\u2019ll be able to drink again! This is NOT true. I spent so long trying to get my drinking down to a science just to have it go down the drain after the first drink. I would plan to not have any hard liquor, or just one drink an hour, etc etc etc. it never worked, and I would wake up with crippling anxiety, and a few more awful stories in my arsenal. But how could I be an alcoholic? It couldn\u2019t be. I don\u2019t drink every day, I don\u2019t hide my drinking, I have friends, a job, and a stable life! I would look at others doing much worse off than me and think: well I\u2019m not that messed up so I\u2019ll just keep drinking. The things I do drunk are normal for my age, no one is mad. Anything I could say to justify it, I would. However, much to my chagrin, the stuff I did drunk was not normal and in fact very concerning. I wish to god i had come to this realization earlier, before my drinking led to the serious upheaval of my life. Now thankfully, I know I am an alcoholic. When the idea of drinking comes to mind, I have a multitude of stories that will snap me right the fuck out of that line of thought. Im still new to long term sobriety, and the idea of relapsing is utterly horrifying and I have every reason not to drink. The scary part is awaiting the moment I begin to convince myself to. I would always stop for a while after anything bad happened, but after a while those experiences don\u2019t seem as bad and my resolve would crumble. I guess I\u2019m scared of trusting myself. One day at a time  i suppose. Sorry if this ramble did not make a ton of sense. Iwndwyt.",

When I drank too much one day I would make sure not to do it the next time I drank.  I would drink normally around some people and let loose around others.  It seemed like I was always plotting and planning my drinking to make it look and seem like I had it under control.  I was stuck here for a while. Letting go of me wanting to be a drinker helped make it easier - some days are still a battle but they seem less and I can power through them   - this place helps me everyday.  Let\u2019s keep grinding. Iwndwyt",
