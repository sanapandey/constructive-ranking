    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been reflecting on things I\u2019ve experienced this year without alcohol, and it\u2019s kind of blowing my mind. Some of these things I had never done sober before, and others were challenges that in the past I would have used drinking to cope with. But I made it through all of them clear-headed, present and actually living them. And the best part? I\u2019ll remember them.\n\nHere are some of the big ones:\n\nMany ice fishing trips - something I had never done sober before.\n\nWatched the Super Bowl sober - for the first time ever.\n\nCelebrated my youngest\u2019s birthday party and was fully present - It felt good not having to worry about other parents smelling alcohol on me.\n\nCelebrated my own birthday sober - probably the first one in 21 years.\n\nDealt with work stress without numbing it with alcohol - I used to love my after-work beers, but I got through the tough days without them.\n\nWent out to a sushi dinner and didn\u2019t have sake while everyone else did - This one was tough. I love sake, and my brother even ordered me one before I arrived. I told him he could have it.\n\nHad a celebratory toast with bubbly water - still felt part of the moment.\n\nBeen bored, lonely, and depressed... and still didn\u2019t turn to alcohol.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t always been easy, but I\u2019m sticking with it. And I know I\u2019ll keep stacking up more moments like this.\n\nFor anyone out there struggling, keep going. It\u2019s worth it.",
