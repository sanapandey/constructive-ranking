    "selftext": "I\u2019ve decided to quit drinking. I\u2019m 35 years old and have drank on and off since I was a teenager, but it\u2019s been particularly regular (daily) for about 6 or 7 years. It\u2019s gone up and down over time, but lately I usually drink a bottle of wine each evening, or about 4 pints of beer. \n\nI have what most people would consider a very, very stressful job (and one with a high rate of alcohol use). Due to my job, I already go 1 week out of every 6 completely alcohol free, as I\u2019m on-call that week. I\u2019m hoping that has mitigated some of the damage. \n\nDrinking is something I enjoy, I really like the taste of a good IPA, dry red wine, or glass of local mead. In the future, it would be nice to be able to have a glass of wine with dinner, or a beer when out with friends, actual moderation. But for now, I\u2019m quitting completely to focus on my health. Drinking to the point of a buzz has become too much of an after work ritual.\n\nI want to lose weight, I want to have a healthy liver, and I want to be there for my family. I\u2019ve seen a number of alcohol related deaths first hand and I don\u2019t want to go down that road. \n\nSaturday evening I got a slight discomfort on my right side and immediately panicked, looking up symptoms to do with the liver. I don\u2019t have any other symptoms whatsoever, so I probably just overreacted. But that overreaction told me immediately that I knew deep down that my habit was bad for my health. I poured out my glass of wine and haven\u2019t had any since. At the end of this month I\u2019m going to get a physical and make sure my bloodwork all looks good. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. \n\n",

Not being hungover getting more steps in. Better sleep more productive. Give it 2 weeks no alcohol. See how you feel",
