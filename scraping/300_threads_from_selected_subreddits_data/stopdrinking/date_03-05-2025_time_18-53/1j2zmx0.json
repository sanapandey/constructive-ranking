    "selftext": "Hi all!\n\nI cannot seem to find the mental strength to make it more than 3 days without a drink. I\u2019m so good Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, but as soon as Wednesday rolls around, I\u2019m drinking. Then I make it through Thursday, drink Friday, make it through Saturday, and the cycle continues. \n\nThe longest I\u2019ve been without a drink in 4 years was 6 days. Not even a week. I don\u2019t know why I cannot get it to click! It\u2019s odd too, because on the days I don\u2019t drink, I feel great! I feel so good without it, I don\u2019t know why I keep going back to it. \n\nWhat helped you eventually get it to stick? I\u2019d love to hear your stories. I\u2019m a looong time lurker of this sub, and decided today is the day I need to put myself on the spot. I just can\u2019t seem to be stronger than that voice in my head telling me that a few drinks after work sounds pretty good. ",

Do whatever it takes to just push it off and then all of a sudden it\u2019s 8PM and you might as well just get cozy for an early night of good sleep.",

Setting up a hangout with sober friends, signing up to clean at the AA meeting, telling people I would see them tomorrow. We have to do it for ourselves, but until I no longer hated myself on a daily basis, I needed external accountability. I wanted to show up for the people who were relying on me.",
