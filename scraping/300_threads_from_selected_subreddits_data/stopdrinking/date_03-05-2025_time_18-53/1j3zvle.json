And lost a baby probably from alcohol and stress. \n\nIt\u2019s been the worst year of my life. Opening up to people I\u2019m not sure has helped me because my loved ones at the end of the day don\u2019t understand. \n\nMy therapy and groups just remind me that I\u2019m an addict. \n\nI understand things get worse before they get better. But how much worse\u2026\n\nI\u2019m scared. For reference I am a 30f and alone. ",

            "body": "I can relate\u2014not to your particulars (43m) but the overall sentiment. I often feel it\u2019s made my life worse\u2026 but then, at least in my case, I need to remind myself that I have no baseline for adult life. I don\u2019t actually know what it\u2019s like without booze\u2014by my late teens in already had a drinking problem. And then I need to remind myself of my last few years drinking\u2014obese, organs hammered into near collapse, so sick and drunk that half the time I threw up immediately\u2014yet kept drinking because I \u201cneeded\u201d to. \n\nI note that you say you asked for help a year ago, and your counter says 31 days (genuine congrats). I\u2019m not much further along in the big scheme of things, got months not years. I didn\u2019t really get started until I asked for help: big ego.\n\nThat said, I started my recovery years before\u2014trying and \u201cfailing\u201d (or: learning) to stop drinking. I read books, did online meetings under a fake name, but didn\u2019t really \u201csurrender.\u201d So I didn\u2019t make much progress but instead circled the whole issue multiple times, and got a lot of chance to observe how all these ideas worked, in my head at least. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of different ideas and approaches to addiction and recovery. Ideas that come from different times and places, often intertwined. So intellectually we might believe and understand addiction as disease of some sort, while emotionally we\u2019re still in a much older framework that sees addiction as a personal moral failure. \n\nAnd sometimes there\u2019s bad ideas in what are supposed to be good places. It\u2019s a real conundrum because, in my opinion, some sort of \u201csurrender\u201d really does help a hell of a lot but you still need to be discerning. Sometimes people who are supposed to be helpful just miss the mark for lots of reasons. I try to strike the balance by trusting \u201cthe process\u201d overall\u2014no one process, actually, I do AA and Refuge Recovery and therapy and journaling\u2026 not necessarily the individuals, not even any particular ideas\u2014at different stages I needed different ideas to stay sober. I \u201csurrender\u201d not to any individual idea or person or group of people, but to the fact that the way I was living my life just was not working, and I couldn\u2019t do it on my own. \n\nI wonder if there might be something like this in play for you? Like, I find meetings to be really different town to town and meeting to meeting. Some can be really\u2026 dogmatic. I\u2019m not really sure why though I have my suspicions\u2014it does seem to be what works for some folks, but others need a different framework. I don\u2019t think a meeting that just makes me feel bad would be very helpful, personally. I think good meetings do bring up challenging emotions, but that\u2019s different than just making you feel bad. \n\nOr maybe it\u2019s competing ideas in your own head? I still TOTALLY have this subconscious feeling that I was an addict \u201cbecause I\u2019m a piece of shit\u201d while I understand the reality is far more complex, and I think some kind of disease/disorder model (stripped of moral connotations) seems most useful for recovery. Like\u2026 I\u2019m not really a piece of shit. I was a kid in a tiny rural town when I started drinking\u2014I barely had a chance! BUT that\u2019s a thorny idea too\u2014I think for a year or so I basically used that idea as an \u201cexcuse\u201d to keep drinking. I went through a lot of \u201cexcuses\u201d that I picked up in my start/stop period of recovery. I maybe didn\u2019t have a chance then\u2014but I do now\u2014and so do you.\n\n31 days is huge. It\u2019s enough time for a solid foundation, for your brain to start rewiring\u2026 but I know it\u2019s hard to trust. But here\u2019s the thing\u2014I bet the majority of people who have a lot of sober time went through a lot of \u201cfailures\u201d (learning experiences) over a course of years. Some people manage to stop, and stay stopped (or that\u2019s the story) and that sticks out to us because we struggle with it\u2026 but I suspect that\u2019s more the exception than the rule.\n\nWhen I think about the people I really respect at meetings, and what I\u2019ve heard of their stories, it seems most people don\u2019t realize it\u2019s their \u201clast drink\u201d until years later. Or rather they don\u2019t believe it. Even now I have a hard time really believing I\u2019ve had my last drink\u2014but I do believe I WILL have a last drink. \n\nYou will too! You might have already had your last drink! WE might have! Just gotta take it one day at a time to make sure. \n\nIf none of my rambling (sorry) is helpful just know this: you\u2019re not alone in what you\u2019re feeling, and you can do this! 31/31 days is proof you can make it another 24 hours.",
