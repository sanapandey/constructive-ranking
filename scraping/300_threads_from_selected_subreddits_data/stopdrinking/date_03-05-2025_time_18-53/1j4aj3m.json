At least one of them is not to be mixed with alcohol, so of course my rationalization is to stop taking my Rx so I can drink \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\n\nI\u2019ve been wanting so badly to get back to the gym and on my Peloton, but I\u2019m scared to do it if not properly taking care of my self. \n\nToday is day 3 of no alcohol and day 2 back on the pills. I feel like absolute poop the first couple days getting acclimated to the meds, I\u2019m working through it and can\u2019t wait to get to the gym this weekend. IWNDWYT",

I did the same thing with Lexapro and booooyyyy was that a shitty choice.  \n\nOn another note, I\u2019m also starting back at the gym this week! Gotta have something to fill the time that I would have spent drinking at home.",

I unfortunately don\u2019t know anything about your medical condition and would never comment on it or the medication to treat it\u2026 but I\u2019m newly sober myself again (235 days today) and both discovered and fell in love with Peloton!!! \n\nIf not drinking alcohol, so that you can take your medication properly allows you to get back in Spin- it is so WORTH the trade off. The treadmill bootcamps, outdoor runs, Tabata spin classes, Core workouts\u2026 it\u2019s changed my body and life. \n\nI just wanted to remind you that alcohol really is no match for the stress relief, self care and dopamine that Peloton provides.  I know you know this from your own experience- and you\u2019ll never regret not drinking and doing a great workout, I promise.",

I\u2019m slowly becoming proud of myself again- and as trivial as it sounds, consistently working out lets me feel accomplished.",
