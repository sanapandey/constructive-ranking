It\u2019s about figuring out how to manage those emotions and feelings. \n\nAlso some of us have genetics that code for addictive behavior and poor impulse control. It\u2019s a multi layered problem but the drinking is a symptom of something much deeper. \n\nAlso never forget that the booze and the feelings you get when getting buzzed or drunk are just an illusion. It\u2019s not real. It\u2019s a trick our brain is playing on us because it wants more. \n\nMy recommendation is exercise more, eat some candy when you start to crave and in time the cravings will subside. \n\nThink about your life and your future and all you have to live for. Alcohol will indeed kill you if you can\u2019t manage it.",

Mine weren\u2019t related to family and friends, but more so to my body and how it was suffering and falling apart. I also made a list of what would likely happen if I kept drinking. Then I read these lists every single time I had those damn urges to drink. Just keep going. The more days you accumulate the prouder you will feel. That combined with just feeling better in general will start to overpower the urge to put this shit in your system. It\u2019s not easy. But if you don\u2019t keep going you\u2019ll never get to the point where it does become easier. You can do this!",

I tried so many times to give up or moderate drinking on my own and was unsuccessful.  I went to AA and was welcomed into a community that completely understood my struggle to get sober and was willing to help me in any away possible.  I don\u2019t happen to agree with a lot of the AA program, but I don\u2019t have to benefit from it.  \u201cThe only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.\u201d. You have that desire.  Check out AA and see if it can help you.",

I was ignorant to the fact that my drinking life was in fact unbearable, lonely, boring, joyless AND unhealthy. \n\nMy sober life has its ups and downs, but overall it is fun, exciting and so worthwhile. I have lost many friends but gained a much better connection with people who I truly care about and vice versa. \n\nI wish I had found AA earlier, the people there live good really good lives. I recommend reaching out to them. \n\nIWNDWYT",
