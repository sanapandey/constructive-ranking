I hate that I let down myself and my loved ones; I hate the apology tours and the anxiety, I hate that I can\u2019t just be normal. I had about a week back on booze, but I\u2019m starting back at sobriety today. I am planning to look into some outpatient treatment or therapy to help with dealing with this loss while navigating sobriety.\n\nIWNDWYT\n\n  \nEDIT: Thank you all so much for your kind words and love. It has really helped me get through the last 24 hours. ",

I think it's a good idea to seek out some professional help like you mentioned, but can you do something in the meantime to comfort yourself? In times past I have done things to comfort myself, like sitting in a church (I'm not religious but the peace was helpful) or lie on a park bench and look up at the sky. You know best what will with for you, but some loving self-care would be good for you right now I think \ud83e\udd17",
