    "selftext": "I have managed to ruin so many things in my life through alcohol and I\u2019m at the worst I\u2019ve ever been. I have 3 days before I\u2019m evicted for turning my apartment into a squalid hoarder nest, have a DUI, ruined a 10 year relationship, countless friendships, can barely keep a job and don\u2019t even recognize myself. I\u2019m seeing an old friend who just got 9 months sober and he dropped me off at a meeting yesterday morning. I laughed and cried and met a lot of lovely supportive people but got back and drank to stop the sweating and shakes. Today feels infinitely worse but I won\u2019t take that drink, I\u2019ll stay with him to keep myself honest and plan how I\u2019m going to attack the mess I\u2019ve made. I will not drink with you.",

Keep going to meetings and coming here, your first priority in life right now is to get sober and figure out how to stay sober. It can be an amazing journey that you will never regret. Try watching \"Sober Leon\" vids on youtube, they may help put things in perspective. Good luck. IWNDWYT",
