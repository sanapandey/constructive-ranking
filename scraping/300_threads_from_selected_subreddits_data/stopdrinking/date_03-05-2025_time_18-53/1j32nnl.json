    "selftext": "After four months of sobriety and feeling GREAT, I decided to drink. Last week was ROUGH and for the first time in four months I struggled for 3 straight days. On Friday, I decided to give in and wound up chugging any liquor I could until 7am with friends, had the worst hangover to date and my youngest son ended up moving out to his other parents. I am just so disappointed in myself. I was doing so well and set myself back so many steps. Here's to day 2, I guess....",

All the usual sly remarks: \u201cIt\u2019s been a hard day.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s your day off.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019ll be different this time.\u201d  \n\nIt\u2019s been a while so it caught me a little off guard.  I logged it in my journal and reiterated why that voice was wrong. I read through my list of reasons not to drink to remind myself of the mess I was in before I stopped. Then I came here to read some posts.  I am the company I keep.  Reading here leaves no space for that lying voice. Every time it shows up I\u2019m better able to recognise its hollow promises.  Having my journal as a record of previous run-ins helps me a lot. \n\nFour month sober is great! That\u2019s yours forever. Practice makes perfect. \n\nIWNDWYT",

So i thought it was okay. It was the little voices all along and having this strategy could help identify and challenge those",

None of us know where or when the next self destructive thought will ambush us. If I want I can write longer or more detailed ideas on the laptop but I rarely do. \n\nThe most recent journal entry is at the top.  I open it and start writing while it\u2019s fresh in my mind. I don\u2019t want those slippery thoughts getting away before I have time to interrogate them. Once I\u2019ve got the thought down I pop the date and time above it. Sometimes there\u2019ll be a few on a day, sometimes none.  A few days without means I\u2019m winning. A few times a day over a few days means my guard is up and I\u2019m learning. \n\nI don\u2019t edit previous entries. I don\u2019t want the fading affect bias to water down entries. If I don\u2019t have a clear snapshot of what I don\u2019t want I might fall into the \u201cit\u2019ll be different this time\u201d trap.  \n\nI\u2019m not allowed to edit my list of reasons I am choosing sobriety. If I don\u2019t like one I\u2019m allowed to move them to the bottom. \n\nThis might all seem a little strange. I trade shares. A concise set of rules is a must. I used to use this habit of making rules to try to find the perfect way to drink. Finding ways to not drink is a much better idea.",
