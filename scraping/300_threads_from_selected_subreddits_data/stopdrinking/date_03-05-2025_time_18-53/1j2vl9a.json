    "selftext": "In 2.5 hours I\u2019ll officially have made it to day 5, which hasn\u2019t happened in nearly a year. Of course while I\u2019m grocery shopping after a good gym sesh the cravings hit, and it\u2019s a gorgeous warm day out. But I didn\u2019t cave nor do I want to!! I\u2019m feeling more determined to make it the whole month. I want to be the fittest happiest healthiest version of myself. Super excited for a good dinner and then watching the new episode of white lotus with my husband, a poppi, and some popcorn :)",
