    "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019ve been a binge drinker for the better part of 10 years. I\u2019ve tried to quit multiple times with the longest stint being about 5 months. \n\nI\u2019ve tried AA, currently seeing a counselor, I\u2019ve tried sober apps, Naltrexone and nothing seems to stick. I would go to inpatient rehab but I have to take care of my mom and I can\u2019t leave that responsibility on my wife. \n\nI just turned 36 and I had made a vow a few days prior that I would not drink after that because I\u2019m getting too old for this crap and I\u2019m beginning to really worry about my health and definitely don\u2019t want to end up in a position of my wife having to take care of me for my dumb decisions. \n\nWell, what do I end up doing yesterday after having a great birthday weekend\u2026 drank 12 shots worth of liquor over about 7-8 hours. I feel miserable right now and am so anxious and shaky. My heart is beating out of my chest and I unfortunately still taste the remnants of that poison. One would think all the reasons I mentioned would keep me from drinking but nope, I can\u2019t seem to think of those things before consuming it. \n\nMy wife is so mad at me, rightfully so, because of all I\u2019ve put her through over the years with drinking. This is essentially my last chance to stay sober before I get kicked out or she just shuts down for good and we end up as nothing more than roommates. \n\nI\u2019m jeopardizing my job that I fought so hard for as well. Why is it I don\u2019t think of all these things before caving in to demon of alcohol??",

I know that if I have that first drink, I'll have all the ones behind it.  I can't resist the second drink, but I can resist the first one.\n\nI tell that voice to fuck off.\n\nBest wishes, friend.  I will not drink with you today.",
