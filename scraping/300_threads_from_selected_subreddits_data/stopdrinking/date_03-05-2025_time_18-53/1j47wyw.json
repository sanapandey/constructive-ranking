I woke up two hours away from my home with no recollection of how I got there and why I was even there in the first place. I don't want to drink again; it always ends up like this. I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm scared that something happened to me while I was unconscious.",

The driver would NOT have seen me.  \n\n\"Why do I keep doing this to myself?\"\n\nProbably cause alcohol, as wonderful as it can be, is for some of us an ultra-dangerous monster.  The deeper it gets its claws in, the harder they are to pull out, I swear, it was for me.  \n\n\"I don't want to drink again; it always ends up like this.\"\n\nGood.  Remember this feeling as if your life depended on it, cause it just might.  And beware, the monster's best trick is to keep convincing you he's no monster at all, not for you.  Or he makes you not care.\n\nOnly you can know.  You probably do already.\n\nSending you good vibes Rice.\n\nLove.",

I wish I had a splitting headache and couldn't remember how I got here and couldn't remember if I said something or did something to hurt someone!\"\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way! Reach out if you need help. For me, AA worked. The Big Book is available for free online and on apps. Please reach out if you need someone, you are not alone! I will not drink with you today.",

Not the cool sexy werewolves of today, but the troubled and out of control ones.  When I was drinking, I was so afraid I would do something terrible while blacked out.  So many people have committed murder during a blackout, even of the people they love the most.\n\nThe only answer is to stop the transformation before it happens.  Refuse to drink before something truly terrible happens.",
