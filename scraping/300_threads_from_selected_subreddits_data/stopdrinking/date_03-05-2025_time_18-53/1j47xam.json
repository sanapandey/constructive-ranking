    "selftext": "So I'm just over a week without drinking. Last night I was on the phone with my wife, who is in a different city while we situate our move there. She went out to a work event and had some cocktails, she was overall in a great mood and sounded like she had a great time! I was so happy for her.\n\nWell, I'm watching our son, and he wanted a treat. So we went to gas station around the corner to get him some gummies. I spent probably 2 minutes or so staring at the liquor behind the counter, saying to myself that I had earned it and it wouldn't be an issue to get a half pint and have a few drinks while I play KCD2. \n\nThe lady asked me if I needed anything else, clearly seeing me eyeing the drinks. I said \"no\" and paid and left. I was honestly upset that I wasn't going to drink. Like it sucked. But hey, I went to bed early, woke up and went to work today. And I'm pleased with my resolve to not give into myself.\n\nMy goal right now is to get to 90 days. I feel like if I get there and see all the benefits that I know exist, it'll be hard for me to want to go back. But after one week it feels like the internal pressure to drink is higher than ever. I'll push through though. I owe it to my son. To my wife. Honestly though, I owe it to myself. \n\nLFG. IWNDWYT.",

Everyone is different but after a couple of months I started hitting the gym and my life has completely changed and each day seems to get better and better.  Keep at it and stay disciplined!",

Because it was a turning point in my journey, and I hope it will be one for you too.\nI had grabbed beer from the gas station after doing a long drive with kids in the back seat who were grinding my gears. I chatted with my SO as they were out of town after getting the kids to bed. I ended up pouring the beers down the sink, grabbed a sparkling water and watched some TV before going to bed and waking up with a clear head and more patience.\nAt that point I was only 2 weeks in and I am now over 6 months.\nYou can do this! We are all rooting for you!",

            "body": "The first 3 months were definitely the hardest with deciding whether to have a drink or not. But after that I felt it became much easier. \n\nIt's weird how your brain actually rewires to not really consider booze a possibility after a certain amount of time. It's not like I'm actively resisting it anymore. I just don't crave it and almost never feel like I'm missing out - in the beginning I felt like I was missing out at every dinner, party, function, etc. \n\nI agree, if you can just make the mental commitment to get to 90 days, I think you'll find it a lot easier to resist in the future. At least, that's how it's been for me.",
