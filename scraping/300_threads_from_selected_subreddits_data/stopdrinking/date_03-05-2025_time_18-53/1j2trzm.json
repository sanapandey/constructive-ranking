    "selftext": "Half a year ago, I wasn\u2019t sure if I could do this. Sobriety felt like this impossible mountain, like something meant for other people but not for me. I thought I\u2019d be miserable without drinking, that I\u2019d be missing out, that I\u2019d feel empty. But here I am, six months later, and I can honestly say, I feel more full than I ever did before.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been easy. There were hard days. There were nights when I craved escape, when I had to sit in my feelings instead of drowning them. But every time I pushed through, I proved to myself that I could. I gave myself a future that isn\u2019t dictated by a bottle.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve gained in six months:\n\n\u2728 Mornings without regret\n\n\u2728Mental clarity I didn\u2019t even realize I was missing\n\n\u2728Relationships that feel real, not just fueled by booze\n\n\u2728Trust in myself. I keep my promises now\n\n\u2728The realization that fun, joy, and peace exist outside of drinking\n\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling, if you\u2019re on day one or day one hundred, know this: every single day without alcohol is a win. Even when it\u2019s hard. Even when it doesn\u2019t feel like it. The life waiting for you on the other side is so much bigger than the one you\u2019re leaving behind.\n\nTo everyone walking this path, keep going. You\u2019re stronger than you think.\n\nIWNDWYT. \ud83d\udc9b",

It\u2019s been a really satisfying journey of building trust and reconnecting with myself, healing little by little, and feeling overwhelming gratitude for the peace that not drinking has brought me. \nI think the hardest part of this journey was acknowledging/accepting I had a problem and the preemptive grief I experienced when, like you, I was still in the mindset that I would be sad/missing out on fun without alcohol but KNEW it was time to change my thinking/habits around it. It was not only a break-up with the substance but with an old way of thinking and it\u2019s been so rewarding creating a new path in my brain!",
