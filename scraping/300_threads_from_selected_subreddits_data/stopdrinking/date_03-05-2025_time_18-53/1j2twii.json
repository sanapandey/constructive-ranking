    "selftext": "So I\u2019m 54 I struggled with alcohol. Most of my life\u2026I went to treatment twice once when I was 19 once when I was 38 both times I was using cocaine with alcohol. Finally stopped doing cocaine 10 years ago. Was sober for 3 years then got \u201cbored\u201d in my sobriety and started drinking again. I was successful for the first time in my life with my career and only would drink beer.. then in 2022 I got sick over Christmas and beer tasted like shit so I tasted some whiskey. Of course I loved it and got into \u201cgood\u201dwhiskey. I\u2019ve been going through a lot since the first of the year but I had quit drinking on December 24, 2024 and stuck with it for close to 60 days then I decided one day I would just have one glass of whiskey well that one glass of whiskey has turned into 8-10 straight days of one glass of whiskey and in the last three days it\u2019s turned into two glasses of whiskey. Of course over the last days i wasn\u2019t drinking I got into incredible shape was going to the gym every day, working with Buddism and members, feeling very connected to life! I went to the gym this morning. Last night at the Laker game I had a whiskey on the rocks. But I had had some earlier in the afternoon too. I haven\u2019t gotten drunk so to speak\u2026but my attitude has, of course shifted more thinking about me more thinking about whiskey and how I can drink, where I can drink it, what kind of whiskey I\u2019m gonna drink\u2026blah blah..it just starts to completely take over my mind again on top of that. I went to work out this morning and every part of my body was sore. Things were now starting to hurt that had finally gone away.. I mean the shits just poison so I\u2019m on day one again. I will not drink with you today . It\u2019s so much easier to just say no to the first drink. This stuff is so sneaky. It\u2019s unbelievable. Just wanted to share this. I honestly hate alcohol and all the pressures to drink it and everybody thinks it\u2019s so fucking great. I\u2019m so over it. The problem is I still have to go to parties with my wife I still have to go to bars sometimes with my wife to meet other couples and the bottles look all shiny. The lights are on them. Everybody\u2019s sitting there drinking their drinks smiling And I just feel so left out sometimes.. I\u2019m determined to stop this goddamn cycle of beating myself up, haven\u2019t had a hangover forever, but all the little shit it brings, the little aches and pains, and all the thoughts that I have, I just get so self involved. Alcohol shuts me off from so much shit It\u2019s just insidious anyway thanks for reading it\u2019s really not worth it.",

My wife and I have a pretty robust social life and lots of parties we attend for work and believe it or not our son\u2019s catholic school has galas and events. The booze is flowing everywhere. It\u2019s an integral part of our family functions as well. I\u2019ve been a very heavy drinker for the last 15 years (41M) and I\u2019ve just recently decided I\u2019m done. It\u2019s not easy. I started going to AA and have a sponsor. I\u2019m 67 days sober today which is a record for me. The magnetic pull of the booze is for the most part gone. I\u2019m a little worried about when summer rolls around and the sun is shining and the food is on the barbecue. That\u2019s a big trigger for me. Anyways, I just pop zyns throughout the day and especially at parties and I\u2019m finding the nicotine is helping. Not a great substitute but better than drinking myself to death. Which several of my older family members have died from alcoholism. In fact my 42 year old sister just died in 2023. It\u2019s indeed a very insidious substance and nearly impossible for me to stop once I start. I agree with you regarding the amount of time planning and building my life around booze. Making sure I have enough left when the party is over to keep drinking. Or planning recovery days around it. It\u2019s fucking stupid and life is a million times better without it for me.",
