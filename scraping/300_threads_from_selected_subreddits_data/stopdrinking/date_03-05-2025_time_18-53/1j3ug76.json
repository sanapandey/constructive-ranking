    "selftext": "I had a date this weekend. Blacked out. Drove home and couldn\u2019t get into my house because my garage door battery died. I climbed through the doggie door. Phew! Made it. The look on my dog\u2019s face should have been enough to sober me up. I then drunk text my date again and again. I even called him a few names, because drunk me is very irresistible. How could he NOT come over?\n\nI then drank low sugar, low alcohol percentage wine. Disgusting. Still finished it. Opened champagne and stayed up until 4 am. He never came over. Shocker. \n\nFast forward to the next morning. So much regret. Living alone is dangerous because no one is there to call you out. I have a kid and I wait until he is fast asleep most nights. It was my \u201cme time\u201d! You just keep drinking\u2026 1 bottle of wine a night turned into 1 and 3/4. I told myself it\u2019s not 2. It\u2019s fine! Then I realized \u201cwhat if I don\u2019t wake up one day?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m 2 days sober. About 30 hours now and I feel like this is it! I have no desire to drink. I hope this isn\u2019t delusions and I stick with it! ",

I\u2019m wrapping up Day 29 and one of my favorite things is not hearing empty bottles in the trash can. Turns out \u2018me time\u2019 with a Diet Coke or a collagen water is a good time too!

I\u2019d wait for the kid and wife to go to sleep for the real \u201cme time\u201d drinking, although I also drank a bit earlier in the day to fight the hangover from the previous night\u2019s drinking. \n\nOne thing I didn\u2019t anticipate when I quit that turned out to be incredibly motivating for me was the mental freedom I experienced. By that I mean- I didn\u2019t realize how much of my brainpower was devoted to drinking and dealing with the consequences of drinking. Worrying about physically cleaning up the actual messes I made, worrying about if I hid my empties well enough, worrying about when/where I was going to get booze for the day, worrying about how much I have left, worrying about the metaphorical messes I made by texting, using social media while drunk, worrying about whether my wife would believe my lies- I basically had no brainpower left to actually enjoy life. \n\nThe craziest day for me when I got sober was the first time I made it until the afternoon without thinking about alcohol- and my first through about alcohol was the realization that I hadn\u2019t been thinking about it. Incredibly freeing. Not only could I focus on more important things, I could literally just think about nothing- let my mind wander- and it wouldn\u2019t wander immediately to booze. \n\nKeep it up. It\u2019s hard at first, but it gets easier and you will see some benefits immediately, and more and more as time goes on!",

I know those bottles in me-time too, and I live alone with zero kids. Apart from not having a doggy door, or a dog, I have probably tried all the other stupid drunk stuff you seem to know too. That's a great thing about this subreddit: No matter what you have actually done drunk, and you sometimes feel worse than the main character in \"Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas\", there's always more than one other person in here who can totally relate to it, and understand how you feel.  Eventually all those crazy things made me serious about sobering up. Texted my ex not a date. The first few days on this sober streak the hangover made me feel bad enough not wanting any drinks. Then I had some cravings. Not any major physical discomfort, but that habit of always drinking at any possible occasion. After 5-6 days it was a lot easier. \n\nSomeone told me to \"play it forward\" - imagine how I will feel tomorrow if I drink vs if I don't. I also know it's not the first drink I want. I want it all. Not able to stop. But I do feel play it forward helps a lot. And when those thoughts about having a drink shows up in my head I have now officially named that addict voice in my head a troll. And I speak back to it as to a troll. \n\nYou got this! IWNDWYT",

Honestly it\u2019s not that good. And I have every reason to stay sober. Guess it\u2019s like that for everyone who doesn\u2019t manage moderation etc. Still it\u2019s been years since I should have just quit. Had so many stupid excuses. But the more I think about alcohol without the obvious lies I always used to quit another day, the more scary it gets\u2026.",
