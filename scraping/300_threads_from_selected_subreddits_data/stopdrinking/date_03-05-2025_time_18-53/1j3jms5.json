    "selftext": "Hey all! As the title suggests, I\u2019m a bar manager. I was doing fine (on day 3) but today is the day I\u2019m supposed to debut cocktails to staff. How do I navigate the feeling of being a failure when it comes to not drinking, as well as tasting cocktails for accuracy/flavor? Is swish and spit okay? Does that depend on my own level of addiction/discipline? \n\nThe main reason I wanted to stop drinking was because on the days I work, I drink to excess. I got a DUI when I was  21 (28 now) and my whole adult life since then has felt like I\u2019m chasing this dragon away from me constantly. \u201cAm I drinking too much, do I have a problem? Is this normal for adults to drink like this? It\u2019s just beer it\u2019s fine\u201d This leads to a week of hangovers, anxiety, reliance on weed to get through the day, which has caused its own host of problems.  \n\nIWNDWYT ",

The last drink I ordered, he said \"no alcohol\" and smiled before I finished ordering. I answered in Spanish today I don't drink alcohol, to which he told me he doesn't either because he had health reasons. It can be done, but I don't doubt it's hard to do without the right supports in place. I can't say I would've been able to do that early in my recovery. At the end of the day, you need to find what's right for you. I wish you luck and iwndwyt.",

I'm not going back to my old life.  \n\nI feel like I have superpowers now!  Meaning, I can be around thousands of people that are getting hammered and I don't have any cravings.....because I QUIT.
