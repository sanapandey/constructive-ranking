            "body": ">At one point, Musk, who has endorsed Trump's 2024 presidential bid, mentioned his desire for a potential second Trump administration to form a \"government efficiency commission,\" which he has volunteered to join. The former president then praised Musk for his handling of employees.\n\n>\"I love it,\" Trump said. \"You're the greatest ... I mean, I look at what you do. You just walk in and you just say, 'You wanna quit?' They go on strike, I won't mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say, 'That's OK, you're all gone ... Every one of you is gone.'\"\n\n>\"You are the greatest!\" he added after Musk chuckled. \"You would be very good [on the proposed commission]. Oh, you would love it.\"",
