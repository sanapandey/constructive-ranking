Or when they uncritically accepted the accounts of the police following any altercation? Or when they called Vietnam war protesters \"unserious hippies\", or MLK some words I don't think I need to repeat?  \n\nThe news has always been biased, and has always served an agenda. You are just paying more attention now.",

News(papers?) are performing worse, economically in the internet era. \u00a0Now, the news is what fits the algorithm of social media sites like Facebook, and Reddit. So they focus more on inflammatory or addictive content. Now they are truly captured, not just by the powers that be, but the economic system we live in.",

The GOP primary is showing a collapse of support for Trump but it's being misrepresented. Every single primary completed so far has had Trump polling much higher than the actual results. Late deciding voters are breaking heavily against Trump.  In Michigan alone he ended with 11 points less than his polls predicted and Haley benefited. \n\nBiden on the other hand gets lambasted with over hyped negatives and yet he's consistently over-performed his polls.  In Michigan the polls showed a 77% result, but Biden pulled 81% and that's despite the much reported and highly exaggerated protest vote. Sure, Biden would be wise to pay attention to the protest and address the issue, but it's hardly the internal schism presented. \n\nAnd Trump is a criminal with the dominoes falling one by one. Even the GOP faithful are flaking away.",
