The spreme Cort Jason said states and prople under the state control must abide by the federal constitution. State and federal officials and rlected officials take an oath. This creeps power may be void. I would question any arrest he makes. Any law contrary to the constitution is void. His oath is good or not. If not, his power may be void.  He needs to be in front of a judg for sedition and the sedition act. U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court said in\u00a0Cooper v. Aaron\u00a0(1958) that Article VI requires state government officials to enforce the Constitution\u00a0as interpreted by the Supreme Court. With due respect, and oath. Any laws contrary to the 14 may be invalid.  He is an obstructionist and pushing sedition. A guy who disrespects his oath has no power or gets no respect.",
