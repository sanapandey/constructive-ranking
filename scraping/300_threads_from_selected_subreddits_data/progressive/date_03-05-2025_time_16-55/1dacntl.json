I don't know about other states but in mine you don't need a prescription, just make the appointment with your pharmacy.\n\none of the few good things about getting older is getting my shingles vax so i'm not one of the 1/3 of people who get it. I have hear too many horror stories from people who got it to delay. better a sore arm and being tired for a couple days (even yearly flu shots drain my already limited energy) than potential agony that can last months!",
