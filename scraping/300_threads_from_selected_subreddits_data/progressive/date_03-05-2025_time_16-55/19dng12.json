The issue that is actually at the forefront is whether or not the federal prosecutor for that district is a human fucking being or a Republican. Considering how often the Republican menace has stolen judicial seats under the guise of \"we have no idea what we're doing, so here's a couple of judges to lose your mind over\" it is likely that this decision will sit until the Supreme Court gets expanded and we enact a policy to ensure  term limits, proper representation, and anti corruption policies.",

That one is a license to kill too. All you need is to say you felt threatened and you can shoot. There is no obligation to attempt to walk away.

If someone tries to pick your pocket, for example, it would be reasonable force to grab them, grab your wallet back, maybe wrestle them to the ground, but you couldn't just shoot them because escalating to deadly force is unjustified because you weren't confronted with deadly force first. \n\nThis law doesn't change the wider rules around use of force, it just enables people to use a reasonable amount of force in a situation where force might not have otherwise been available because there was not an imminent self-defense justification.",

People who didn't need to die, who didn't deserve to die, who did nothing to warrant being murdered.\n\nThe existence of the law alone, should it pass, will get someone killed. Whether or not the killer gets prison time matters far less to me than the life they took that they wouldn't have felt as emboldened to take had that law not existed.",

Claiming you were afraid or even actually being in fear for your life but without good cause aren't enough. Self defense to the extreme of lethal force is only justified where a reasonable person in the circumstances would conclude that it's necessary to avoid grave bodily injury or death.\n\nThe law doesn't want people going around using lethal force, so self defense is hard to qualify for. It really needs to be necessary, at least according to the law as written and as it actually should be enforced. Sometimes that has not been the case, such as with Rittenhouse or police officers.",
