            "body": ">The Cult of the Lost Cause had its roots in the Southern search for justification and the need to find a substitute for victory in the Civil War. In attempting to deal with defeat, Southerners created an image of the war as a great heroic epic. A major theme of the Cult of the Lost Cause was the clash of two civilizations, one inferior to the other. The North, \u201cinvigorated by constant struggle with nature, had become materialistic, grasping for wealth and power.\u201d The South had a \u201cmore generous climate\u201d which had led to a finer society based upon \u201cveracity and honor in man, chastity and fidelity in women.\u201d Like tragic heroes, Southerners had waged a noble but doomed struggle to preserve their superior civilization. There was an element of chivalry in the way the South had fought, achieving noteworthy victories against staggering odds. This was the \u201cLost Cause\u201d as the late nineteenth century saw it, and a whole generation of Southerners set about glorifying and celebrating it.",
