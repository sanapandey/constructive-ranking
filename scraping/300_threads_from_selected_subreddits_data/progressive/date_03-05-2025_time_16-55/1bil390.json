Fact checks are a waste of time.\n\nRepublican voters can be led around by the nose, and facts are not as important as supporting the team. It's not debatable. \n\nAnd because nothing is as important as the team, nothing is less important than the opposition team. This is why collaboration with Democrats is anathema to Republican voters; they see the opposition as an enemy. Why would anyone collaborate with an enemy?\n\nThey are not American voters anymore. They vote against America. Look at their words: they absolutely hate America and most Americans. Ironically Republican leadership hates Republican voters most of all. Republican voters are totally clueless to how much the leadership hates them.\n\nGOP GPS says to drive into the pond, Republican voters are going to drive straight into that pond. If you say \"look out for that pond!\" they'll respond \"Eat shit, libtards!\"\n\nI'd be fine with them all ending up in the pond.",
