Biden may not be my favorite but he\u2019s way better than Trump. It shouldn\u2019t be that way, having to pick lesser of two evils, and in an ideal world it wouldn\u2019t be but this is the world we live in now.",

The LGBTQ, black people, and women of child bearing age will SUFFER IMMENSELY under another Trump presidency.  Under Republicans in general.  This is why I vote blue.  Not because they're the perfect candidates, but because they're the only viable choice and I'm an an adult enough to realize that 3rd party votes are pointless in our 2 party system.  Until we get ranked choice,  that's how it's going to be.   It sucks, but it's reality.  Too bad & grow up.",

                            "body": "So, there's this one old white guy, who opposed school bussing and desegregation because he didn't want his kids \"to grow up in a racial jungle.\" This same guy wrote the crime bill that caused the explosion in mass incarceration in the US, and who said in 2006 \"We've all voted [and] I've voted, and others have said, look, marriage is between a man and a woman and states must respect that.\" He also said that \"poor kids are as smart as white kids.\" That person is Joe Biden.\n\nEdit: Biden is so often on the wrong side of history, even when he was young. What are the odds that he suddenly did a 180 as an old man?\n\nAs for women's rights: it's really unfortunate that states have cracked down on abortion, but the president isn't going to do anything about it. Trump is strongly supportive of states rights in practice (see by his lack of intervention into state drug policies, state abortion laws, and different covid responses). Biden hasn't done anything against the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v Wade, and it doesn't look like that's going to change. If you don't like your state's laws on abortion, you have 2 options: vote out your state legislature, or move. The whole country is absolutely not going to agree on this issue, as both sides are just digging their heels in.",

It didn't make sense when I first learned about it in school, and it still doesn't. The only reason it still exists is that, were it eliminated, republicans would never win another national election (the horror!). And voters in solid blue/red states could feel like their vote might actually make a difference.",
