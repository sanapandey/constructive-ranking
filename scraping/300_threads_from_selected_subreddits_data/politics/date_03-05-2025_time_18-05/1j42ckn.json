He and his people all remind me of that type of supervisor.  Hired and promoted above their skill/knowledge level, but they are able to BS their way up the ladder, while you have to work extra hard to do your job in spite of them, because you care about doing a good job/providing good service.",

It is just like the wall that Mexico is going to pay for. It is just a fucking soundbite.\n\nAs for its origin\u2026.it is likely because he thought NAFTA was due to Obama, even though it started with Reagan.\n\nRemember with Trump the soundbite comes first.

He's not one of the ruthless tech bros or industrialists who have spent decades building sprawling empires of expansions and acquisitions. He's never seemed to care that much about money, more about the appearance of having it and the accompanying notoriety. He honestly seemed to enjoy the attention he got when losing it almost as much.\n\n\nIf I had to guess, DT has heard \"hail to the chief\" playing in his head every time he walked into a room since he was a kid. I don't think he wanted or cared to win his first election, just enjoyed the trolling and thought he could make a quick buck off his voters after. But once he got into office and that started happening in real life along with people standing, saluting, applauding, he liked THAT. In his mind, the presidential pomp is how it always should have been and should be for him.\n\n\nHe's not one of the hyper capitalists, he just desperately wants their validation as one of them without doing the work, which is why Elon running the country doesn't bother him at all. He's always made his money via marketing: NY tabloid developer, reality TV star, top twitter troll shilling branded products, candidate.\n\n\nI think the people running the show are the same and it's not about the money for them anymore either. It's about power and domination. They don't like what they've seen from a large, educated middle class in Europe that demands thing. The shift in the power dynamic after covid infuriated them. It's not about them getting more, it's about us getting less. Thats why markets are spooked outside the federal sector. It's a war on workers, OSHA, benefits and the safety net, the 40-hour work week, child labor restrictions, etc. The rhetoric is all about lazy work from home leeches. Now even having a job doesn't shield you from being a taker, it has to be the \"right\" kind of job, ie. A blue collar dirty job. Nobody else deserves what they're making.",

He looks terrible. He often looks confused about where he is or what he\u2019s doing. His handlers push papers in front of him to sign. Someone agitates him and he spews off a firestorm of incoherent nonsense.\n\nHis followers then eat this up because that\u2019s the Trump they love! Sure, he doesn\u2019t make sense most of the time, and he\u2019s even more crude now, somehow. (That\u2019s not his fault, it\u2019s probably dementia finally taking over.) His handlers smile knowingly; they know they can\u2019t do this without him. He\u2019s a puppet and nothing more.\n\nWhen he dies, his fanfare will die with him. The dust of his presidency will settle. Americans will finally start to pick up the pieces. JD Vance is not well liked, even by his own party. \n\nYou\u2019re seeing a fragile old man fight his way through cognitive decline, heart disease, and rampant narcissism (the latter of which has existed for decades). \n\nAmerica will heal, I have faith in her.",

A lot of the rich get richer off a a recession. \n\nBut a majority probably don't want to decimate it and create something like the Great Depression. Some did get richer during the Great Depression. Other of the wealthy got poorer. Too much unpredictability as to how to end up on top from an economic apocalypse. \n\nThat being said, Musk and some of the other fascists probably also want a global recession for another reason.

He has been truthful about wanting tariffs, but certainly not about what they actually are and what effect they might actually have.  He continues to lie about who is going to pay them.  Prior to the election he didn't mention that there would be some amount of time where things will get bad, but then will get better.  He waited until he won the election to drop that little nugget.  Instead, he told them he'd be fixing things on day 1 and that he'd wave his little magic mushroom and everything would be 'great again.'  Yes, they're idiots for believing him, but I'm not going to let him and the GOP walk for their lies, manipulation and deception.",

I think what is much more likely is that US companies will raise their prices and increase their profit margins to continue to make record profits while foreign companies raise their prices to cover the tariff.  So, the price difference between the two products (US v. foreign) may not change much if at all.  The foreign producer might lose a bit of demand, but probably not enough to warrant building production plants in the US.  Meanwhile, the US consumer will pay higher prices regardless of the point of origin of the product.    \n\nThose that move some production to the US likely already had plans to do so and aren't going to be forced into it by tariffs.",
