Over the past two decades, the disparity between Western (particularly French and American) equipment and Russian equipment has only widened. Add to that Russia's limited ability to supply and export arms in light of the Russia-Ukraine war.  \nFurthermore, The SU-57 is not a true 5th-gen- it does not have the exceptional stealth attributes that the F-35 (or even the Chinese J-20) possess.\n\nI find the insinuation that India would leak the tech to Russia bizarre- Russia and India are nothing more than partners of convenience, we perceive the Indo-American relationship as far more consequential. Perhaps someone could shed light on this?",

That's a good friend to have if your adversary is the most populous communist country in the world.  Their economy could rival China in a few decades.  Their science  and technology could also rival China or the United States in a few decades.\n\nI'm sure JD Vance's Indian wife has nothing to do with it.\ud83d\ude09",

That seems bonkers to me, bit while I still see them as the US's biggest foreign adversary right now, I am not as worried about them as I once was.\n\nAnyway, if we want China to be kept more in check, we need allies in the region to be a little more powerful. India isn't a perfect ally, but it is one. These are the only two nations with over a billion population.\n\nI imagine when selling such products to another country, there can be care taken in altering the product such that it doesn't have all the proprietary advanced tech in it that we don't want to fall to the enemy. That's purely speculation, but it's not without precedent.",
