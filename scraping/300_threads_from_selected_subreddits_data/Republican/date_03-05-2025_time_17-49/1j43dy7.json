The whole demisexual and pansexual business is just how one wishes to engage and develop attraction. \n\nA dude putting on a dress and having sex with another dude is homosexual sex, and the need to lie and say otherwise is just internalized homophobia to me and most unfortunate. A dude can express themselves as feminine or their conceptualization of feminine but it's still homosexual sex. \n\nGay sex happens, and I think Republicans have learned to largely tolerate that fact if not accept it.",
