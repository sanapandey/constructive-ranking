The user does not appear to be a concern troll, but just didn't flair properly and has a suspicious account (not all suspicious accounts are indeed trolls).\n\nThat said, I would still rather us post good article than fake news. Please, if you post what you can reasonably argue to be fake news, contextualize it beyond just flailing it fake news. Otherwise it just looks like your troll posting.",
