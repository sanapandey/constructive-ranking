The hope is by cutting spending and promoting business these people will be able to transition to more productive sectors of the economy. There was a huge post COVID federal hiring boon and that needs to be reversed. It makes the unemployment numbers look good but kills productivity which is why we've been having to keep interest rates high, which mask the insane inflation numbers we are producing trying to run the economy on dust.",

In fact id question why you wouldnt? These people have been shit talking Republicans since the internet was a thing. Fuck em if they can't handle their own medicine. I say keep rubbing their nose in it, otherwise you turn into a spineless piece of shit like McConnell.  \n\nAlso, it's totally red pilling the entire generation z and alpha who eat memes up.

Most of them aren't worth even addressing, but I like to make comments to some and even keep some up to show why we take some of them down. Especially when we have to take so many down in a single thread.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure that all of this is astroturfing. That term implies (to me at least) that this is coordinated in a way that the users doing it are at least a little bit aware of what they are doing. I don't think that that's the case. If it's astroturfing, it may just be because someone else is encouraging them to check out our sub and then these users just feel the need to comment. And the could be done simply by someone at reddit making sure a few more of our posts show up on r/all than normal in the algorithms. That is purely speculation though.",

And if the leader hasn't, his inner circle most certainly has. \n\nThe examples you cite about Trump, and what makes him successful are Machiavellian. \n\n- Trump's \"America First\" policy aligns with Machiavellian realism, focusing on national interest and power rather than moral imperatives. This approach emphasizes achieving the best outcomes for the nation, even if it involves actions considered morally ambiguous.\n\n- Trump's use of unpredictability as a strategic tool mirrors Machiavelli's suggestion that feigning madness can be advantageous. By keeping adversaries uncertain of his next move, Trump aims to gain leverage in negotiations and deter opposition. \n\n- Machiavelli famously posited that it is safer for a ruler to be feared than loved if one cannot be both. Trump's rhetoric and policies often project strength and a willingness to confront both allies and adversaries, fostering a perception of dominance.\n\nSo when you're done telling me how you're the \"decent adult\" in the room, crack open The Prince and learn something for a change.",
