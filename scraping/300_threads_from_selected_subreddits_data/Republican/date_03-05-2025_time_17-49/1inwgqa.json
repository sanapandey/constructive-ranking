If they can do that, I believe they will, they\u2019ll win big again. Setting themselves up for failure is a liberal tradition.",

It does usually involve a powerful charismatic leader. People might debate that Trump is charismatic \n\nI think we throw out labels really quick these days. The American people and electoral college made a strong statement for change..\n\nI don't always agree with Trump's choices or his style  people need to think about the last 4 years and whether if they were better off in regards to safety and money. \n\nUnfortunately, the Democrats weren't listening to the people. and what they needed. Because of this Trump's approval rating right now is twice what it was in his first term.\n\nYou would think Democrats would be happy that we are eliminating wasted dollars. This is our money. I do believe that some of the decisions of eliminating this waste hurts helpful grants and has caused significant numbers of layoffs. This sucks that there is collateral damage \n\nI have voted democrat and republican, so i'm not trying to grandstand. I hope the Democrats learn from this and come back strong but right now their leaders are not doing this  Biig Mistake!!!!! Dei seems to be a big subject and I don't want to argue it. I do believe we have laws in regards to discrimination. Nobody should be discriminated agains but sexual orientation should not be the reason they are hired. A person should be hired their because of their ability to do a job. This should be the reason \n\nCalling people names like Hitler can radicalize people to do evil things. Misguided souls thinking they are doing good. We need to stop!\n\nA a small number of americans seem to have the loudest voices, but they're saying a ton of wrong things. Let's be a nation that practices civil discourse. We will never all agree on the same things.\nCaring and compassion for our fellow Americans would be nice. \n\nPRIORITY ONE CANCEL THE VIEW!!!! THOSE LADIES ARE SERIOUSLY TOXIC AND UNINFORMED!!!!\n\nI should have made this a Reddit post instead of a response. My bad.",
