            "body": "It\u2019s because the United States is a nation for the people, not for a religion. Although many of the foundin fathers were Christian, they were of different denominations- and back then, not being the same kind of Christian led to some pretty nasty bigotry, especially in England. That\u2019s why freedom of religion is in the constitution, to originally protect different denominations of Christianity and then of religions of the people who immigrated here. The article doesn\u2019t talk about nuclear family really- just that the mainly Protestant idea of Christianity and virginity should be maintained. I\u2019m all for teaching abstinence in schools and all that but we need to make sure that it\u2019s both girls and guys who get those lessons- this article seems to blame everything on girls. \n\nOn nuclear families\u2026 it\u2019s called nuclear for a reason: the Cold War. Guess what\u2019s not happening anymore? The Cold War. We\u2019ve moved beyond an era of nuclear families- society has changed, and always will. Life isn\u2019t the same as it was sixty years ago when the idea of the nuclear family was a thing. So it\u2019s not right to say it\u2019s under attack when it was always meant to fizzle away.",
