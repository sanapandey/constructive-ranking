Of course I did some research on my own, and like Wikipedia says the Republican Party is pro-business.  Supports lower taxes and deregulation.  Opposes socialism, unions, and universal health care.\n\nThat\u2019s not a very big list, so I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s not everything?  So do you all mind if I ask what the Republican Party is about? ",

            "body": "The policies you support are going to be reflected by your representative in congress and locally. \n\nRepublicans and Democrats are amorphous balls of policy due to our two-party system. The parties have multiple 'factions' that center around different ideas on how our party should implement policy. Currently the Republican leadership, at least federally, is populist and are led unilaterally by Trump. While Democrats essentially are running on, \"I'm not Trump,\" but have a whole host of issues as well.\n\nThe party does shake things up every few years. Once Trump is out of office the GOP will likely change again. \n\nI suggest you look into how your district of voters is organized. I'm in a very red area, so I attend my local meetings for Republicans physically and Democrats at least digitally via recording.\n\nThese are the links you should check out:\n\nHouse Website: https://www.house.gov/leadership\n\nSenate Website: https://www.senate.gov/committees/membership_assignments.htm\n\nTrump Platform (Agenda 47): https://www.donaldjtrump.com/platform\n\nYou can look up your senators and house rep on these sites. I strongly suggest you do a quick google search or even an AI prompt to ask about controversies and platforms. Then go to your state websites and familiarize yourself with key issues your state is discussing via PA. Also, can be an AI prompt, just ask for sources.\n\nLast piece of advice, your party can be wrong. Don't be afraid to not vote or vote against your party's candidate, that's democracy.",

To a much smaller degree, they want to let an individual be an Individual. Make your own choices and live your life as you please, but within the confines of the law.",

In 2007 the government told banks to give out low or no interest loans and the government would pay them if the people defaulted. Then it didn\u2019t work and the government blamed the banks and tried to back out of the deal. It was all started while Clinton was in office and masterminded by Andrew Cuomo and then Bush tried to undo it but the damage was already done and his administration wasn\u2019t able to stop the resulting economic collapse. Plus the democrats constantly stonewalled because they wanted the collapse to make republicans look bad. This caused tons of financial issues and lots of people to lose homes, jobs and even their lives. Just for political power.",

The government should not be all powerful with its tentacles in every pie. That's what the concept of small government is about.\n\nFor business in particular, let the free market reign. If a company is harming the environment by dumping forever chemicals into waterways, they should be punished and forced to stop. If they're not harming anyone, let them do business.\n\nIn my opinion, no monopoly exists without government intervention. Take the major Internet companies, who started as cable TV companies. They have agreements with local municipalities that no competitors can use their infrastructure, their wires or their poles to offer competitive pricing and services. Those rules, enforced by government, prevent us from having the free market competition that gives us better pricing and services that other countries enjoy. \n\nThis is one example of dozens, hundreds of ways the government over reaches and controls us. These deals are usually in exchange for under the table money or promotion to lucrative positions once politicians leave office. \n\nThere's a concept called The Revolving Door, where officials in charge of regulating a certain industry are given cushy jobs once they're out of office in exchange for favorable regulations. Then the other way around when board members of big companies are hired to run the regulatory agencies for that very business. That's what leads to corruption and the crony capitalism we see in our government today.",

But then the unions wanted more power. They required workers to have payroll withholdings of dues, and required membership on some states. They bankrupted companies to prove a point, they even today will strike to prevent automation at ports. So they often now raise the price of goods, to guarantee their jobs and stifle innovation and automation. They have a place, but as with anything else, they often abuse their power.",

The individual wields the most power and authority over their lives with the distribution of governmental authority growing out from the individual through community platforms, mayor's office, state legislature with the federal government being the last rung on the ladder and having the least authority and impact over the individuals life. This allows the individual to be as close as possible to the policies and regulations that influence his life. This structure would allow the government to grow out of the greatest level of power derived from the masses. Opponents to this (i.e. liberals) generally want power distributed down to the masses from a large centralized government.  In this model the individual becomes the smallest cog in the machine. Obviously there is a lot more to this but that sort of spells out the fundamental difference, philosophically anyway.   Try reading Thomas Sowell.",

Also, agricultural dollars end up on plates across America, and the places with the highest populations benefit from those dollars much more than the lower population centers that supply those resources.

You can even raise your kids according to your own interpretation of biology and gender, you can assign sex and gender at birth and force them into the roles and behaviors you see fit for them.

Everyone who is not an Indigenous Native American whose ancestors were here before Columbus and European colonization is either an immigrant or the descendant of one.\n\nThe republican party stands for white supremacy.

There's people with xx chromosomes who have testes. There's people with xy chromosomes with ovaries. There's many other animals that have a diverse array of sexual and reproductive expression. Clownfish all are born as male and turn female when it's they're needed to reproduce as such. Sea horse males carry the offspring and give birth. \n\nhttps://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/animals-that-can-change-sex\n\nhttps://www.aquariumofpacific.org/onlinelearningcenter/species/clown_anemonefish\n\n>Clownfish are protandrous hermaphrodites, meaning that they all mature as males but have the ability to change their sex to female. A typical harem living in the host anemone consists of a breeding pair and up to four juveniles (non-breeders). The larger fish of the pair is the female. She controls the dominant male from becoming a female while he controls the juveniles from becoming mature males. Should something happen to the female, the male of the breeding pair changes to a female, rapidly increasing in size. The next largest male usually becomes the breeding male.\n\nhttps://www.hudson.org.au/disease/womens-newborn-health/intersex-conditions/\n\n>What is intersex?\nIntersex is an umbrella term for people whose reproductive organs, sexual anatomy or chromosome patterns differ from the biological definition of male or female. There are many ways someone can be intersex as it involves a spectrum of reproductive characteristics. Being intersex is a natural variation in humans, it does not mean there is something wrong. \n\n>Intersex traits can relate to\n\n>Genitalia\nInternal anatomy\nHormones\nChromosome combinations different to XY (male) and XX (female).\nSome intersex people have both ovarian and testicular tissue, while others have atypical female or male genitalia, or male/female genitalia with variations in their internal organs and/or hormones.

In this study, we explored whether the concept of gender varies as a function of different cultural and linguistic norms by comparing communities that vary in their social treatment of gender-related issues and linguistic encoding of gender. In Study 1, Italian, Dutch, and English-speaking participants completed a free-listing task, which showed Italians and Dutch were the most distinct in their conceptualization of gender: Italian participants focused more on socio-cultural features (e.g., discrimination, politics, and power), whereas Dutch participants focused more on the corporeal sphere (e.g., hormones, breasts, and genitals). Study 2 replicated this finding focusing on Italian and Dutch and using a typicality rating task: socio-cultural and abstract features were considered as more typical of \u201cgender\u201d by Italian than Dutch participants. Study 3 addressed Italian and Dutch participants\u2019 explicit beliefs about gender with a questionnaire measuring essentialism and constructivism, and consolidated results from Studies 1 and 2 showing that Dutch participants endorsed more essentialist beliefs about gender than Italian participants. Consistent with socio-cultural constructivist accounts, our results provide evidence that gender is conceptualized differently by diverse groups and is adapted to specific cultural and linguistic environments.",

            "body": "The short answer is one what 'reddit' doesn't want you to know.  We are for democracy.  Democracy is I think 'for the people'.  While many democrats think democracy is not cutting programs because, they provide services to the public, many services dictate what/how we should run our lives, and become a crutch for others, leaving people to depend on them (instead of trying to run independent lives).  Our government should be there to assist us.  Healthcare for example is great, and I'm thankful I have it.  But some people don't believe in it, and they forced everyone through Obamacare to take it (or pay a penalty).  When Trump (Republicans) tried to get rid of it, it was undemocratic because 'everyone has that right' not forgetting that religious/personal values were affected.  So to the democrats (and liberals) more services is democratic because we are giving them more services, whereas really, because we are leaving it up to the individual or states, it's more democratic.  \n\nIt's also about lower taxes too.  We have a current tax freedom day on average of...tax day (which is April 15).  It might be before or after that, but very close to that day.  That means, if you were to pool all your income together in a year, all of that money right now (you can look this up) will go towards your yearly state, federal and local taxes.  It's insane.  That's not counting sales tax or other taxes from goods or services produced (I don't think, but I could be wrong).  So cutting taxes is important as well.",

Isn\u2019t it better that everyone has access to the same services, so they have the freedom to choose where they want to live or how they want to live?  \n\nPoorer states would always have fewer services available, basic items like roadways if it was left to the states right?  For example, I live in Oklahoma, which ranked 10th in receiving federal funds vs taxes paid. \n\nhttps://okpolicy.org/facts-and-figures-on-federal-grant-dollars-in-oklahoma-2024/\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that there isn\u2019t much going on in eastern Oklahoma where I live, but without the federal funds, for transportation, healthcare, childcare, etc I think it would be a pretty dystopian location.  \n\nWouldn\u2019t that make people move to more affluent state because they would be able to afford proper roads which limits what people could do?",

We want the government out of our business, but at the same time we want the government to stay logical and fight for the ideals that we believe in, we\u2019re hard working, and only want what\u2019s owed to us, nothing more, nothing less. We dont want free hand outs, but at the same time we want to be able to afford basic necessities for ourselves at a fair price\u2026 unlike when Biden gave out free $1,400 checks to people, left out some, then allowed rich California Liberals to move to our states, buy up all of the rental properties and raise rent from $756 to exactly $1,400 a month.",
