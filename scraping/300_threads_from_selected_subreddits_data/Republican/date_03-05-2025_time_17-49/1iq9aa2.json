That's it.\n\nHe doesn't have power to cutoff anything. Nothing that gets cut off is cutoff by him. He reviews iformation and makes recommendations of what is wasteful to people who legitimately do have the power to cut it off. The people who the only reason they didn't cut it off already is that they didn't know about it. \n\nHe let's them know about it.\n\nShould he only be allowed to look at information curated by the very people who don't want to lose thier wasteful programs? Is that the oversight he needs? His hand held so he doesn't look in the wrong places for what corrupt politicians are hiding?\n\nOr in other words, he needs oversight so he can't find exactly what his job is to find.",

                            "body": "For one thing, he has a history of lashing out against his critics by violating their privacy and disclosing private information. Most famously, the utterly absurd case of him leaking the DM he had with someone who called him out for lying about being a pro-gamer, pretending was uncovering some \"concpiricy.\"\n\nThat's not the sort of person who should be trusted with sensitive national information. Next time he decides to lash out against someone who is calling him out over something more serious than a video game drama, he might be able to a lot more damage to both the US government and the individual as punishment for critisim. \n\nOn that note, DOGE also seems unqualified with cyber security affairs. Not only is there no oversight on Musk to take adequate security measures to prevent leaks of national data, but there is also no reason to believe a malicious party won't alter data Musk has, which could result in bad recommendation or manufactured sacandle.\n\nOn the note of the manufactured scandle, Musk and DOGE also seems grossly unqualified to give out any sort of recommendation. We can't go a week without Musk or someone on the DOGE telling some utterly nonsensical review of the data, which points him as either incredibly stupid or an incredibly dishonest person. To me as a tech person, this is most obvious when he does \"tech commentry\" of the US databases, which might sound impressive to a non-tech person, is actully just nonsense to people who know tech. Like his comment about SQL serves or non-unique social security numbers in database tables.",

Democrats counter argument is \"well the money still needs to be spent.\" They are fighting it in the courts to make the payments happen despite Trump EO.\u00a0\n\n\nSo essentially they are admitting to the frauds and claims the money still should be spent for these programs. The other argument they made, is \"rich guy shouldn't have access to out privacy\", despite Trump running a campaign for this. The irony is that Democrats want to hire more IRS's to audit us taxpayers, yet the taxpayers cannot do the same.\u00a0\n\n\nDemocrats are on the losing side of this. And they have NO PLAN how to fix the Federal debt. They actually don't care if the federal deficit goes even higher. Hence why a good reason Trump approval rating is up while the Democrats rating is at an all time low.",
