What part of that said fire all DEI ATC employees and create a shortage of already shorted ATC employees because of DEI. \n\nAnswer non of it the EO was to stop the shortage by allowing 1000s of qualified people to be hired that weren't because of DEI standards that prevented it.\n\nBut yet what happened in stead is the lunatic left saying OK all you DEI hired are fired blame Trump.",
