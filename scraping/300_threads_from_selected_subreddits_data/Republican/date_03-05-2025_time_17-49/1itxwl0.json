    "selftext": "More than US $50 billion worth of lumber and other forest products could get much more expensive after Donald Trump announced plans for a global tariff of 25% on all products imported into the United States \u201cover the next month or so.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said the tariffs would take effect from April 2nd \u2013 in time for the start of the Spring season \u2013 and will concinde with others duties placed on imported cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.\n\n",

What if he lifts sanctions off of Russia? What if he clears out of Europe and tells Putin that Eastern Europe is Russia's sphere of influence? What if he succeeds in rolling back birthright citizenship? What if he ignores judicial rulings? What if he weaponizes the DOJ to remove judges who rule against him, regardless of party affiliation? What if he invades Canada or Greenland? What if the stock market crashes and you go into an extreme recession?  Where exactly is the line for you?\n\nIs all that fear mongering? Because I can support everyone one of those with statements made by a) Trump, or b) Musk, or c) the cabinet.\n\nThe fact that he is calling Zelensky a dictator and making deals with Putin and you guys are fine with that is absolutely mind blowing. We are living in a bizarro-world.\n\nHe's going to cut/or has cut government services, consumer protection agencies, commercial and industrial oversight, is in the process of gutting the department of health in favour of a non-science based approach to medicine.\n\nAll those cuts and they don't even come close to making up for his 4.5 trillion tax cut for the rich.\n\nYou all are the biggest suckers I've seen in my life.\n\nRead up on Curtis Yarvin\n\nRead up on Project 2025\n\nRead up on Christian Dominionists\n\nOr just delete this and ban me like you do to any dissenting voice. Even your fellow conservatives if they don't agree with you 100%.",

Reported it to my states attorney general and got a resolution in like 2 weeks. It's a useless agency that is suing businesses. Their name isn't accurate to what they do.\n\nAs a matter of fact, thinking back, it has been like 3 years, and I still haven't gotten a reply from them.",

Reagan, Clinton, and Obama all made cuts or reorganized agencies to increase efficiency. It\u2019s about prioritizing where taxpayer money goes. If it negatively impacts essential services, then it\u2019s fair to criticize, but making government leaner isn\u2019t inherently bad. Let\u2019s look at the actual outcomes rather than assuming the worst.\n\n2- Recent discussions about the DOJ under Trump suggest concerns about its independence. Attorney General Pam Bondi established a \u201cWeaponization Working Group\u201d to review alleged politicized actions within the DOJ.  Additionally, FBI Director Kash Patel initiated significant personnel changes within the bureau, actions some view as politically motivated.  \ufffc \n\n3- \ufffcWealth doesn\u2019t determine a person\u2019s character. actions do. Success should be celebrated, not demonized. Targeting people simply for having money is class warfare, plain and simple. It\u2019s not about defending billionaires; it\u2019s about defending the principle that hard work and innovation should be rewarded.\n\nYou see cuts as breaking up democracy. We see it as streamlining the one of the largest bureaucratic apparatus in the world. Every dollar the government doesn\u2019t spend is a dollar that more productive citizens can use to make their lives better.",

It takes years and year to build factories and supply chains for saw mills and steel plants. During his last term, his tariffs on steel shot the price of a sheet of 16ga hot rolled mild steel from $95 to $236 in my area. It shut me down. If he does this stupid shit again, I\u2019m sunk.",
