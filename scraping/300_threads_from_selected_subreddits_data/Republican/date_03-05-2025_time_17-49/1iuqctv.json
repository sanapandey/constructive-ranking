The constitution existed before Zelensky was elected. Even his two main political opponents have said it makes no sense to have an election while in the midst of a war.\n\nhttps://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/ukrainians-are-proudly-democratic-but-resoundingly-reject-wartime-elections/\n\nGoogle for other links (there are many) if you don't trust this one.\n\n> that he could have negotiated out of years ago,\n\nSays who? What Trump really means by this is \"why doesn't Ukraine let Putin have what he has already taken in exchange for security guarantees\".  When Putin has shit on security guarantees and Trump has turned his back on US promises.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum\n\nGoogle for other links if you don't like that one.

So, it could have been over, but Britain just had to get involved; kind of like the way the Brit\u2019s turned what would have been just another franko-Prussian war into WW1.\n\nThe war never would have started if the last administration hasn\u2019t thought it a good idea to poke the bear by pushing to put nato right up against Russia\u2019s borders, and Harris had kept her mouth shut. \n\nI\u2019m fine to let Ukraine fight this war as long as they want to\u2026just without US help.\n\nIf rational negotiations, based on realistic expectations, are not acceptable to them, and they think they can beat Russia, they can decide to go for it. I\u2019m not standing in their way. ( Maybe the Azov Battalion will see them to victory, where the original Nazi forces failed. )\n\nBut, they aren\u2019t entitled to have us continue to equip and fund this war. Let the European countries help them, if they like. It\u2019s not our war, and we have our own problems to deal with ( a big one of which is run away government spending and immense national debt ). \n\nIt\u2019s not in our best interests to continue to pump more money and equipment into this war. It never was. Then again, maybe I just feel that way because the profits of this huge money laundering operation weren\u2019t going into my wallet.",

And, while we are forced to fight for our constitutional right to keep and bear arms, at least we still have one. It\u2019s illegal to even defend yourself in the UK. Sounds like a real bastion of liberty to me /s\n\nSo, the Zelensky was ready to negotiate peace with Putin, and the prime minimum of the UK tells him not to do that, to keep the war going, a few years ago, and you don\u2019t think the UK bears any responsibility for the fact that the war is still going on? No blood on their hands at all? \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not absolving the previous administration of all blame. If Harris hasn\u2019t have indicated that the Biden administration was fully in favor of making Ukraine a part of NATO, putting NATO military forces and weapons on Russia\u2019s border, knowing that Putin was dead set against that, the same way we were against Soviet missiles in Cuba, Putin would never have invaded; as evidenced by the fact that he invaded right after that. However, once both sides were ready to negotiate peace, no one should have done anything to prevent that. It\u2019s not like Ukraine ever had a chance of winning. If we hadn\u2019t have been propping up their war effort ( more blame for Biden for the continued death and destruction), the war would have been over a long time ago.",

You act like they\u2019re a tyrannical autocracy or banana republic. Imperfect, but so are we in our own areas. \n\nI\u2019m no certain how willing Zelensky was to negotiating any peace deal given yah know, they want Russia gone and Russia isn\u2019t willing to give up anything. And I\u2019m unsure of how much influence the UK had on him. You keep talking about peace but let\u2019s call it what it really is: capitulation. What else do you call rolling over and letting Russia keep what it stole? And let\u2019s go off the assumption that they did get Zelenskyy to keep going, their is blood on their hands but it\u2019s drops of blood compared to the Russians who\u2019s hands are dripping with blood, are you really that unable to just fucking blame Russia? \n\nThe idea that this war was started over wanting Ukraine in nato or over nato weapons is laughable. There was hardly any in Ukraine before 2022, limited to numbers and javelins etc, and no one was really seriously considering nato and merkel iirc had said as such. Especially since part of joining nato iirc you can\u2019t have an ongoing dispute or war, which was indeed still ongoing prior to the invasion in 2022 so they couldn\u2019t join even if the rest of nato really wanted that. And you seem to forget that Russia had already invaded twice already, you do realize that right? And they already had a history of starting wars lol. Just looking at their post Soviet years alone shows a history of unjustified wars. Moldova in \u201892, Georgia in \u201808 (also they basically were involved in the civil war in the 90s iirc), and as I said they\u2019d already invaded Ukraine twice FFS. Ask yourself this, why did the former Warsaw Pact nations rush to join nato and not just trust that Russia wouldn\u2019t try anything again\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s unbelievable that you can blame anyone but Russia and just be so willing to let them get away with this. Do you really think they\u2019d stop? That they wouldn\u2019t invade again?",

You could have saved them the bother of having an obviously unnecessary revolution, and we could all still be British citizens. \n\nYou certainly remove any mystery as to how we went from a country based on limited government and individual liberty to people living under the biggest government in history, with a fraction of the liberty we started out with; down on our knees begging for scraps of freedom from our government masters.\n\nFrom an article dated Feb 14, 2022:\n\n>The main issue highlighted by the crisis on the Ukraine borders over the past few months has predominantly focused on the role of Nato and the friction over the eastward expansion of the alliance. This has been a constant message emerging from the Kremlin: that the Nato membership of many parts of the old Soviet Bloc, and the prospective membership of Ukraine to the alliance, poses a threat to Russian sovereignty.\n\nIn fact, VP Harris gave a speech at the DNC winter meeting implying that Ukraine was a part of NATO, and quoted that speech in a Twitter post on 2/19/22. Russia invaded 2/24/22.\n\nThe Twitter post was deleted 3/15/22. \n\nBut, of course, none of this could possibly be related or indicative of a reason behind the invasion /s\n\nAs far as the UK\u2019s role in preventing a peaceful resolution to this war, years ago:\n\nhttps://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/05/06/boris-johnson-pressured-zelenskyy-ditch-peace-talks-russia-ukrainian-paper",

When we got things started most of the population didn\u2019t have anywhere near equal rights lol. African Americans were owned as property. Women didn\u2019t have equal rights. And not even all white men had equal rights lol, as there were property requirements to vote for the first 50 or so years! That\u2019s not to bash the founding fathers or anything, especially given things were as bad or worse in the rest of the world and it was simply how things were and we can\u2019t fully apply our modern values to people 250 years ago, but FFS to say we have less liberty or anything than back then? Fucking ignorant when if we applied how things were done and what rights we all had in the early days, there\u2019d be little to no rights or liberty for most people and a small fraction of us would be able to vote. Yeah, we definitely have less than we did back then\u2026what the fuck have we lost lol.\n\nSo some vague discussions, comments really, about such a thing, which wouldn\u2019t even be possible for the reasons I noted, are valid reasons to invade\u2026sure.

Perhaps recent history has taught them the Russians can\u2019t be trusted lol. Especially when Russia never stopped its aggressive tendencies and desires to influence and rule others. You act like they didn\u2019t invade Moldovan in \u201892, totally weren\u2019t involved in the Georgian civil war in the mid 90s, invaded Georgia in \u201808, crimea and the Donbas in \u201814 and 15. Yeah. Definitely on Ukraine. Not because Russia has imperialist tendencies, and very Ultranationalist/ jingoistic propaganda, and doesn\u2019t even recognize Ukraine as existing really. Do you also someone for getting mugged lol? \n\nSo they influenced them to do this becuase they don\u2019t trust Russia. I can understand that. You can\u2019t trust Putin, what worth does his words have?

Those are powers the constitution forbids.

You say we had more liberty then, I point point out most didn\u2019t have much if any liberty, and then you pivot to try and say it was a societal problem. Ignoring the fact that the constitution literally defined African Americans as 3/5s of a person. Or that there were requirements by the government to keep people from voting or having equal rights? Like keeping poor whites from voting via property laws. Does Jim Crow ring a bell? Or how even non slave states had laws about escaped slaves? What about how women didn\u2019t have equal rights either, not able to vote nationally till barely 100 years ago and there were legally enforced barriers to them doing simple things like owning property or starting a business except under certain circumstances like widows. Natives weren\u2019t even citizens till 1924 and had laws that fucked them over too. To act like our government was perfect and free back then, that we had more liberty, is false. It was how things were and that\u2019s not to say our founding fathers were evil and all that crap progressives spout, but we were imperfect and our nation unequal, with only a few enjoying all the liberty endowed to them in the constitution.

But what do you even mean about most thinking the government should be the master not the servant, most of us dislike and mistrust the government to varying degrees (especially when we don\u2019t like the party in power) and don\u2019t want them telling us how to live our lives. What do you consider them acting like our masters and what do you mean by them being the servant, what do you consider that to look like? Honestly you throw words like tyranny and authoritarian around as easy as the left does. \n\nlol, your condescending attitude and words don\u2019t make you smarter, you do realize that right? Acting like you\u2019re more intelligent doesn\u2019t actually make you more intelligent. If you\u2019re going to debate someone and try and supposedly educate them then drop the snobbery. It is not helpful or respectful at all. I don\u2019t claim to be the smartest fella around, or the most educated or anything of the sorts. Nor am I unwilling to change views when provided the evidence to convince me. I do not limit myself to sources that confirm my opinions and tell me what I want to hear. And I quite enjoy reading about history, from the early days of sumeria, to the Bronze Age collapse. From the epic 2000 year journey of Rome, from kingdom to empire, from Scipio Africanus to Augustus to Diocletian to Majorian to Basil the bulgar slayer to Constantine XI. To the age of exploration and world wars etc etc etc, I will not claim to know everything, but since I was young I have had a great passion for the past. Do not patronize me and act like I\u2019m some uneducated fool. Fuck off with that egotistical energy.",

Tyranny is the action of government; or more correctly government usurpation of power. Things like racism or sexism are flaws of society. There is a difference, and I\u2019ll explain that as I respond to your comment.\n\nSecondly, I wasn\u2019t being snobbish or condescending. I was being serious. You are a victim of our failed education system and of an agenda that seeks to invalidate the constitution, and thereby get people to willingly give up its protections.\n\nHowever, I will admit to being a bit too harsh. But, you need to understand that you get the type of response that your own words inspire. The tone of your original response to me was extremely condescending and derisive. To be honest, until your most recent response, I was almost sure you were just a left wing troll. I\u2019m willing to give you the benefit of the doubt, though, because of this last response. So, I apologize for my harsh tone.\n\nIf you\u2019re serious about having a valid discussion, let\u2019s restart this without the attitude on both sides of the conversation, and I\u2019ll address all your points. \n\nYou bring up a lot of different, yet related issues, and you\u2019ll have to give me time to address it all. I don\u2019t spend a lot of time on Reddit, and I do have life obligations that take my time.\n\nFrom everything you\u2019ve said, there are a few main points I feel I need to address:\n\n1) the actually history and accurate perspective of it. Your misunderstanding of the 3/5 rule is a good example of this. So, I\u2019ll address the historical questions, you present, first.\n\n2) the next really important element is what is liberty and what constitutes tyranny. The fact that you say the only thing your older family members can think, of that you could do but can no longer do, is drink at 18, illustrates one of the great dangers of incrementally increasing tyranny. If you slowly chip away at liberty, one cut at a time, people acclimate to it, and don\u2019t really see what\u2019s happening; while a sudden massive tyrannical power grab is likely to meet with strong resistance. The founding fathers actually warned us about that.\n\nI\u2019m only 54, but I\u2019ve seen a massive loss of liberty, just in my lifetime. So, I know they did, too, but it happened gradually, and they probably never even realized it happened. If you put a frog in a pot of water, and very slowly turn up the heat, he\u2019ll never realize he\u2019s being cooked until it\u2019s too late.\n\n3) our system of governance, as established by the constitution, and the fundamental principles that are its foundation.\n\n4) the final thing is examples of what liberty we\u2019ve lost. That\u2019s actually an easy one. \n\nIf you *are* actually interested in having me answer these points, I\u2019ll gladly do so. I\u2019ll do my best to keep it as short as possible, but these aren\u2019t really short reply kinds of questions. Like I said, you\u2019ll have to be patient. I only have time to write sporadically, throughout the day.",

Both countries leadership are evil. \n\nAs for the negative things said about Putin, these are just the ones I remember off hand... Just a month ago he said Putin is destroying Russia, he rules Russia with and iron fist, told him not to meddle in US elections at the g20 summit, told him Russia is in big trouble, called them out for killing thousands of people in Ukraine, he reminded Putin of the sizable US force in Europe and not to escalate things in Ukraine, he is threatening sanctions and tariffs on Russia, etc. \n\nKeep this in mind as well... One country (Russia) is a decent size and actually poses a small threat to the US. One country (Ukraine) is a small country and poses absolutely zero threat to the US and would not exist without US help. The leader of Russia is getting along with the US at the moment and the leader of Ukraine is stalling peace talks, demanding more help, and criticizing the country that literally kept his country alive. At this moment, it makes sense to be tough on Ukraine and easier on Russia because Russia is actually complying with what the US wants.",

Treaties with Russia quickly drew those nukes back within Russian territorial boundaries.\n\nUkraine was a very different story.  Ukraine was a technological and manufacturing powerhouse from the former USSR and had both manufactured most of those nukes and missiles, but also was the primary source of trained personnel to maintain them and build new ones.  In fact, Russia actually had to conclude a later treaty with Ukraine to provide skilled labor to maintain those nukes that Russia had.  But that is another story.\n\nKnowing Ukraine had the know-how and capability to posess nukes, but also knowing Ukraine, at the time was hopelessly corrupt and did not want to spend money on those nukes, the US, UK, Russia and Ukraine entered into nuclear non-proliferation talks with the goal of de-nuclearizing Ukraine.  Those talks succeeded, and became UN Treaty Registration Number 52241, colloquially known as the Budapest Memorandum.\n\nIn agreement to return the nukes to Russia, Russia, the US and Great Britain gavce vague security assurances which boiled down to two concrete treaty responsibilities.  First, none of the signatories would invade Ukraine (ha!) and in the event of invasion, the signatories would be required to meet and determine a course of action to support Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty. \n\n\nFast forward, and in the mid  2010\u2019s Russia both invaded Ukraine, starting an eleven year period of hostility and violence, mostly through proxies but exploding to the full scale war we know today.  UK and US met, as per the our treaty obligations and determined to support Ukraine through arms, training and humanitarian aid.  In addition to our treaty responsibilities, the US, under Joe Biden, also convinced many of our European allies to support Ukraine in a similar manner.  This was due to intelligence that indicated Russia was planning additional quick invasions, with Moldava scheduled to be invaded the first week of March, 2022.\n\nIt was a lot easier to perform our responsibilities because a popular movement in Ukraine had existed for years combatting corruption, leading up to the creation of an immensely popular Ukrainian TV show, Servant of the People, where a high school teacher became president and cleaned up the corrupt government.  This series so resonated with the reform minded psyche of the Ukrainian people that the star of that show, Volodymry Zelenskyy, an accomplished actor, was drafted into politics and in a stunning upset, actually elected President on a reform platform very similar to what his TV character championed.  Certainly an example of life following art.\n\nBut it boiled down to the fact that a pro-democracy, anti-corruption government in Ukraine made performing our treaty obligations an easier pill to swallow.\n\nIn 2025, the US had repudiated our treaty obligations and are refusing to continue to support Ukraine, as agreed in our required meet and confer.\n\nNow, this is a good deal of history and we approach our real point.\n\nUkraine is, to date, the only country in the world that has given up nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees.  It is also the only country in the world to be invaded by one of those guaranteeors, and also the only country in the world to have another one of those guaranteeors refuse to abide by their treay responsibilities.\n\nOther countries are watching this, and weighing the value of developing nukes and retaining them, vs the value of negotiating away their nuclear armament.  And they overwhelmingly see that giving up nukes results in existential threats to their sovereignty and existence as a culture, and that the most powerful countries in the world are either doing the invasion, or standing by while it happens.\n\nThe conclusion is that if Ukrain falls, there will be significant increased nuclear proliferation as a result.  No one will, ever again give up so much as a single nuke.  And if nukes proliferate, they will eventually be used.\n\nThis boils down to one idea:  If we do not support Ukraine, eventually millions of people, possibly people you know and love, will die in nuclear fire.",

Zelenskyy didn\u2019t do what Trump wanted so he\u2019s bad, Putin has realized that Trump will give virtually anything you want if you flatter him so Putin is good. This is all personalist nonsense.\n\nI voted for the guy twice including this time, but his petty whiny vindictiveness continues to get in his way and leads to some really idiotic positions.\n\nUkraine needs to accept a deal, they no longer have a path to victory. Do you think Trumps schoolyard insults help or hurt the effort to make that happen?\n\nNow go back to Moscow.",
