This country is hanging on by a thread and this is your attempt at starting a serious discussion? I\u2019m all for rooting out waste. I\u2019m all for getting independent auditors (after legitimate background checks) into every one of our agencies and finding waste/fraud. I also expect a detailed report sent to Congress so they can do their Constitutional duty of appropriating funds that cuts out waste/fraud. It\u2019s how our government is set up.",
