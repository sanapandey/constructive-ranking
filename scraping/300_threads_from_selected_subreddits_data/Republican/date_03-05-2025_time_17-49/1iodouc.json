When I go into this community I feel like every comment section I see people spouting hate not even on just the democrat voters but on all of those who oppose our thinking in the political landscape. I don\u2019t understand why we feel the need to do all of that I have seen some community members say downright repugnant stuff. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to work towards helping them see the error in their ways through calm and calculated discussion? Shouldn\u2019t we try to put America first together? This level of animosity was not the norm before the 2010s I just don\u2019t get why we need to keep at the arguments and yelling. Should we not try to get back to working with our fellow Americans if your family members were to have a different political party and ideals than you do how would you honestly react. I bet it wouldn\u2019t be on par with the stuff I see on here. I would like to start a serious discussion about this.",

And you know what after he let me and my community down I did some digging and yeah I do think he\u2019s on that list and I do think it would have been better if we had JD as president because I think JD would\u2019ve stood by the working American. Another reason I voted for trump was I thought he would stop the bloodshed happening in the Gaza Strip and he has now talked about sending our troops in their and into danger to secure \u201cprime\u201d real estate but that\u2019s not the point of this post I wanted to start a discussion on wether we think it\u2019s worthwhile to return animosity with animosity my maw maw would say an eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind.",

The spending freeze was not for contracts that have already been fulfilled and I guarantee you definitely were not a part of them but are just pretending to in order to gain some sort of authority on the subject just like pretending you voted for him, he hasn't sent troops to the Gaza strip, and the whole eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind is a Gandhi quote that people constantly hold up as some sort of argument even though it doesn't hold up to minor scrutiny. If someone attacks you, would you attack back or just sit there? You didn't vote for trump and are just regurgitating leftist talking points that are just plain wrong and missing context.",
