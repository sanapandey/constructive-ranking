Similarly, we are all bound by the social contract from birth. If someone in a position of duty betrays their responsibility by refusing to help in a crisis, that is, in essence, a form of betrayal. In the case of an environmental disaster, their negligence is equivalent to abandoning their post in a time of war. Such betrayal should carry the ultimate consequence.",
