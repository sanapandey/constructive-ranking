The \"massive payout\" to people who long dead and 150 didn't exist, it was just inexperienced coders not understanding Cobol, aka the coding language that is basically extinct but which most of the government runs on because the systems were built back in the 70's and 80's. \n\nTry this: Take the total cost of the US government payroll ( publicly available info) then multiply that by the percentage of people he's claimed he's laying off. that's roughly $300M dollars per year \"saved\", without counting the added facilities costs, etc. \n\nThen subtract: \nThe cost of Trump's golf trips during his Presidency - $60M per year. \nThe cost of the sporting events he's gone to so far - $38M. \nThe cost of the emergency food supplies abandoned at docks and warehouses: $480M \nThe cost of unplanned de-mobilization of over 4000 federal staff overseas: $210M \nThe cost of US equipment left overseas as a result of \\^ : $90M \n\n\nThen add in the cost of the Private contractors that have been hired to replace the government employees, the added facilities contractors to expand facilities for the \"return to the office\"... There are over $40M/year in contracts just for leasing parking lots near federal buildings because they don't have the capacity, and the new/upgraded facilities like the \\~70 new detention facilities and upgrades and Gitmo: Roughly $3.4B.",
