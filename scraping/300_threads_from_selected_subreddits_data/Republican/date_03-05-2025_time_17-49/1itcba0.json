I had a very successful carreer, and my federal job is the exact same thing as my military job. That being said, I\u2019m probationary until May and they are probably going to lay me off. My bosses are all trying to find a way to keep me because they need me and it\u2019s not a job someone can just go do, so it\u2019s usually critically manned. \n\nThis whole thing has been reckless. I voted for Trump, and I don\u2019t regret it, but he\u2019s not doing himself or his voters any favors by doing stupid things like firing our Nuclear employees or people dedicated to the bird flu. \n\nThis isn\u2019t twitter. This is government. My job has a direct correlation to military readiness, and some of my coworkers took the buyout. If we lose them, and then we lose me, we are gonna be hurting at my organization. \n\nI\u2019m telling y\u2019all, we need to call good good and bad bad. This is bad.",

                    "body": "But Trump was clear about his intentions when running: retribution and getting rid of the \"deep state.\" In your mind, what did you think he meant by the deep state? He meant more than just the \"normal\" Republican idea of reducing taxes, shrinking the government and reducing regulations; he said his goal is to stop the \"steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and wealth of the people.\"\n\nAnd just rememer that Trump has never been a fan of \"suckers\" who serve in the military. As far as DOGE is concerned, YOU are deep state. Here you come, all fresh out of the military, so sure of yourself and your value to the country, ready to jump in and suck on the teat of the government as a military contractor. So ready to drain tax dollars as you join the creep of government bureaucracy. \n\nI'm not saying I disagree with you. I would at least hope that Trump's team has a plan OTHER than just shock and confusion, fire everyone and then patch the biggest cracks. But clearly it's been decided there just isn't time for deliberation, it shoot first, don't try aiming.\n\nTrump is impulsive. But you knew that, and that's part of his unique charm!\n\nHe impulsively, immediately, freed everyone jailed for the Jan6 Capital event, not wanting to waste any time to sort them into violent offenders versus non-violent. He put Musk in charge of blanket firings, stopping payments, and reducing our federal workforce. They are shutting down government departments like the Department of Education, US Agency for International Development, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and considering shutting down the FBI, IRS, and several other agencies. They've already fired many in these agencies.\n\nSo I wonder where you got the idea the dismantling would be careful, fair, or involve any weighing of consequences? That was never the plan. The plan was, and still is, do it quick and make it impossible to fight against. Make it painful for anyone to fight against so people go along with it.\n\nWe were told, before we voted, exactly the plan. We voted for this! And, anyone with any financial sense understands we must get a handle on our ever-expanding bureaucracy. It's time to cut out a huge portion of staff and programs and we haven't even started on cutting military, social security and Medicare yet.\n\nThis is just the beginning! \n\nPeople need to stop complaining when the cuts hit them personally. We voted for this. It means people we care about will lose their jobs, and many their careers. It means health insurance is going to be more expensive for most people. It means childcare will no longer be subsidized. Special education is going to be changed. Lots of things people have gotten used to counting on will have to be eliminated.\n\nAnd there is not much time, so this is all going to be fast and furious. If the bulk of the layoffs and budget cutting isn't done before midterms, the opportunity could be gone. So by voting to put Republicans in power, we voted for exactly what we are getting.",

IF they lay me off, they are going to be scrambling to bring in someone active duty or they will try to convince me to go back to Active Duty, or they will try to rehire me immediately (as they did with the Nuclear workers).",
