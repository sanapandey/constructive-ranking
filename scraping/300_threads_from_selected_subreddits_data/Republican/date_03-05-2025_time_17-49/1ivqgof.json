I understand it was never going to happen on day one.  But he has done nothing to even begin curbing it.  Some might say he has made it worse.",

I'm guessing that you're one of those people who think the lunatic lefties are correct in thinking that the plane crash in CANADA was his fault, too. Then again, I think those lunatic idiots, need to start eating their crow anytime now.  The newscaster who was interviewing the head of the FAA asked him If it had anything to do with people that President Trump fired; he said, \"Absolutely not.\" \nI can't remember what he said verbatim, but the employees were not in those positions! \n\n[Blaming President Trump for plane crashes ](https://www.newsweek.com/bakari-sellers-donald-trump-american-airlines-plane-crash-2023597\n\n\n\nIt's no secret that the lefties have no brains, but anybody with even half a brain would know that this man could not do everything overnight! He's only been in office a month and has done amazing things so far. No one should expect him to do everything overnight. If one was listening, he did say prices will spike for a minute, but then they'll go down. \n\nHave you been watching anything that he's doing with Putin and Zelinsky? Do you realize that the reason he hasn't blown Hamas to smithereens, is because he would kill our hostages as well? That's why he's accepting the way they're coming back, and they are coming back slowly but surely. \n\nHe re-closed the border, thank God. This was his first and foremost campaign promise!\n\nHe stopped the handouts to the ILLEGAL ALIENS, and that means more for citizens who need it. Some people are seeing it, and some are not yet. Getting rid of ILLEGAL ALIENS has a domino effect; for instance, if they have a farm job illegally, that's a job for one of our citizens.\n\nSpeaking of prices, locally, our gas went down a few cents on January 21st, and it's been going down. In fact, at some stations, it's gone down to a total of $0.60! \n\nYes, He's doing things at breakneck speed; maybe people just can't keep up with him and miss everything that he's doing!\n\nGood God give the man a chance to do his job.",

Be better!  \n\nYes, when a leader makes promises, there needs to be results. I am simply expecting the same thing he would from his own staff. If he can't do it then he should have kept his mouth shut and ran on a different platform. \n\nHe claims to be the best President in the history of the United States, but so far he is just another 10,000 pound gorilla beating his chest.    \n\nI hope he proves me wrong and he really does Make America Great Again, but so far it has just been another episode of the Apprentice.",
