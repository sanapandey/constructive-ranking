You have to apply for it to start\u2026\n\nMost of this is probably data entry and database management issues.\n\nSomeone is born in 1900, gets a number in 1940, dies in 1950. Their family doesn\u2019t notify the office, and it wasn\u2019t all automated. They never started their benefits. In the 1980\u2019s their data shows up with no death date and just gets entered as is because #NotmyJob. Now 40+ years later they still show up as alive because they never got reported as dead when it was all on paper. Their benefits never started and it\u2019s just a data issue.\n\nNow if there are benefits active for some of these going places, then yes\u2026 it\u2019s an issue. But what\u2019s been presented so far is just indicative of poor database management/data entry/data collection. An investigation would still need to occur.\n\nEdit: my own comment copy/pasted as another response on another thread",

They will only justify their infiltration. We should demand the same integrity from our republicans as we do democrats. In this case,  young programmers / coders are pulling reports the wrong way. Just like in Quickbooks, you can pull Inactive Accounts in your current customer list, because a setting for \"include inactive\" was selected. Only, in the government systems, it's way more complex with acronyms. Sensational results of fraud are more likely related to programming coders accessing a system they do not know and integrating it with Musk's xAi collossus program that has never been tested or validated or presented to our Republican Congress. These are not accountants who know these systems. \n\nAnd who will be blamed for this? Republicans. Who will lose all the future elections. Republicans. This is not going to end well.",
