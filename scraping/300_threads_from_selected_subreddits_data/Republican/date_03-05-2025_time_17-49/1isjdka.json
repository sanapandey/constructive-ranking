They must have realized, prior to getting asked to quit, that it was going to happen, so there is no excuse for losing attention at work. \n\nStress is no excuse for doing a bad job at work! And, quite obviously, the danger of working distracted in this job can mean people die! \n\nSwalwell must be wrong. These crashes must just be flukes. If we can go without any more crashes for a year, that would go a long way to show how WRONG Swalwell is, correct? Just wait and see!",
