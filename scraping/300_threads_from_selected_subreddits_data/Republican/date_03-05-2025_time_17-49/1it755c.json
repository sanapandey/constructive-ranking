The underlying government report (primarily the CBO\u2019s budget outlook) does reveal that the national debt is at a record high and on an unsustainable path\u200b[crfb.org](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/cbo-releases-january-2025-budget-and-economic-outlook#:~:text=CBO%20Releases%20January%202025%20Budget,or%20118%20percent%20of%20GDP)\u200b[gao.gov](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-25-107714.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20GAO,than%20the%20economy%20each). It also shows that recent years\u2019 policies \u2013 including those under Biden \u2013 have added substantially to the debt. However, the report itself is not \u201cshocking\u201d in tone and does not explicitly pin the worsening debt solely on President Biden. The \u201ccrisis grew much worse under Biden\u201d phrasing comes from political commentary, not a neutral government conclusion.",
