My wife works for a state-level anti-violence non-profit, which, essentially means that she works for an organization that provides resources to people who undergo violence, whether physical, domestic, sexual, etc. They received an email from the administration saying that they have to change the names of different kinds of violence to terms that are deemed ok by the administration. One example is that the org is no longer allowed to say \"gender-based violence,\" even if a specific case of violence that occurred is clearly based in gender issues. During the first Trump organization, they were being policed by members of the administration to make sure they were using terms that the administration deemed ok.\n\nBeing an anti-violence organization, they regularly speak out against all forms of violence, no matter the political situation or \"side\" of the spectrum. However, they have to be very careful now if they say any kind of violence against right-leaning figures/organizations, because they could lose their funding, and they have been threatened in the past by the Trump administration that they could pull funding if they do not comply with how the organization presents itself.\n\nLong story long, Trump and the right in general all are not for free speech. Only when it fits their perspective. Same with the left.",
