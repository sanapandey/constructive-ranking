That being said, when you embrace a toxic ideology, you\u2019ll either 1. Attract the weakest of people who cannot make you a better version of yourself, or 2. Be alone with your 10 cats. \n\nThe only positive part, is that men get to see the toxic traits in these women before they decide if they want to engage in any type of relationship with them.",
