But neither will happen because half of the country is completely fine with Judicial Activism. Wisconsin Supreme Court is controlled by activists who said in the campaign trail that they would overturn abortion laws, without even seeing the case arguments. (They did). This is happening everywhere. As the left loses legitimate power they turn to the only power they have left. Judicial Activism/Legislation. As Elon said, if one Judge in a Blue State can overturn a President, we don\u2019t have much of a Democracy.",
