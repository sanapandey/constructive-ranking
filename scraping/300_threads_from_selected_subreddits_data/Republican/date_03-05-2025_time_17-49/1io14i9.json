He\u2019s childish,  that is very obvious, but he is doing what he was hired to do and he is pull the curtain of all that hidden and red tape that we the people deserve to see. He\u2019s a means to an end, if he does it right then I have no complaints. Also it\u2019s just very ironic that liberals even bought a Tesla in the first place when it actually costs more oil and lithium mines of child labor in most places. But now that he is doing his job and actually exposing the spending people hate him more than ever, which is weird. No one hated Kamala, we just literally said she did nothing for 4 years and came from a very weird background.",

Whether that be claiming he is a founder of tesla (a lie) claiming he personally works on the rockets at space X (a lie), claiming he is an ardent supporter of free speech (a lie), claiming he was legal citizen (seemingly a lie), claiming he is doing audit for the Americans and not a clear power grab, and of course, stretching the truth about what he is finding so far through DOGE in an effort to divide the people.\n\nYou can disagree and thats fine, but i think hes a lying, entitled sack of shit who only cares for himself and has zero interest in helping the American people beyond some cursory items to limit bipartisan backlash. The simple fact that he effectively bought his position only makes it even worse. Why not put someone in charge who has significant corporate turnaround experience, not someone who has only been successful because he over promises, under delivers and take government handouts? (remind you of any particular party?)",

I just assume this is Reddit, and if you're dislike this or that then I can basically know where you stand politically, most people here are cookie cutter. I appreciate your view. I never really had a problem with Elon. I never saw him as our savior like a lot did just a few years back. (I always thought Tesla was going to bomb out, but nope he kept finding people who loved him and would invest). HOWEVER, I also didn't really change my view when he kinda flipped sides and bought twitter and became the move evil man alive. I guess my point is, he was meh then and is meh now to me. He has some great companies and he did gut a lot of twitter employees so I'm hoping he is the wrecking ball that we hope he will be. I don't have to like the person to appreciate the work they've done/doing.",
