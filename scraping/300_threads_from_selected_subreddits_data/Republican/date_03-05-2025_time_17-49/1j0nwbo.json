When's the last time a VP has been this involved in every day events?\n\nSeems to me, they ALWAYS seem to slip into the background out of sight, and out of mind.  In fact, I've heard a lot of \"conventional wisdom\" almost implying that is what was expected of them.  \"Stay out of the way, and wait your turn.\"\n\nYeah, Vance is definitely the successor if this ends as a successful Presidency.",

I\u2019ve voted Republican my entire life (Trump three times), and seeing how Trump is unilaterally purging the government, forgoing any sense of international diplomacy, and handing over the reins to an unelected billionaire is leading me to seriously consider voting blue. I really need the Republican Party to stand up to Trump and create some barriers to what is going on - he is acting like a dictator at this point, and our government structure was set up to stop this but it requires leadership with a backbone.\n\nI\u2019m not saying Trumps actions are all bad; some are common sense. However, I do feel like his actions and behaviors to this point aren\u2019t particularly appealing to many Americans and his \u2018progress\u2019 isn\u2019t being received the way many MAGAs might believe it is.\n\nUnless we see the price of goods drop in the next couple months, and don\u2019t see unemployment dramatically increase, a blue wave is coming. Trump won this last go round because Dems couldn\u2019t get a viable candidate to get people off the couches. That likely won\u2019t happen next time, and people will have an incentive to vote. BTW - Republicans would do well to find a leader not attached to Trump if they want a shot in 2028",

Chamberlain gave into Hitler's demands for the sudentanland, and for his part Hitler promised not to invade the rest of the Czechoslavakian nation. If you know anything about WW2, that was the biggest blunder for Chamberlain, trusting a dictator to hold up his end of the bargain.",

Additionally they would have a strong US business presence in Ukraine, far greater than when Crimea was taken, and more importantly much more public.  That is itself a de facto guarantee, just look at the first Gulf War, Iraq invades Kuwait, where we had large oil and sea travel interests.  Without the US there is no Ukraine, plain and simple, it would absolutely be in their best interests to cuddle up as close as they can with America.  Even if the EU went full bore into Ukrainian support, they simply do not have the military stockpiles the US does and it would take them decades of insane spending to try and close the gap.  If anything the real WWII lesson to take away from here is that Europe once again refused strength and left themselves with their asses hanging out and weak.",
