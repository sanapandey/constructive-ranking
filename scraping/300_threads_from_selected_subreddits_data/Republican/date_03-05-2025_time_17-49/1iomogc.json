Patel said the program has been misused, but he does not support making investigators go to court and plead their case before being able to wiretap any U.S. citizen. \n\nStraight from the article. It appears to me, that Patal believes the program has been misused but and this is critical, he doesn't support having investigators go to court and plead why they should wiretap Americans.",
