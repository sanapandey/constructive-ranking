The Democrat sub has like 30000 upvotes on average.\n\nThat's not by accident. That's by design.  A simple picture of Trump winking with a subtitle \"Trump is eyeing some woman.\" gets 40,000 votes easy. \n\nIt's actually much worse than you think. It's mot merely Democrats controlling Reddit. It's massive domestic bot farms and foreign adversary bot farms.\n\n80% of the Democrats you talk with on Reddit aren't even real people. Look at their comment history patterns. With chat gpt, it's childs play to get millions of bots on Reddit when you're phony and fake, and have no morals.\n\n\"Ask a Trump Supporter\" sub was ran by non Trump supporters. They are meant to look like Trump supporters. It's controlling the narrative on many levels.\n\nThe good thing is that 99% of the US doesn't use Reddit more than maybe once a month. I don't know anyone aside from myself who uses Reddit at the frequency I do. Coworkers, family, friends. Unfortunately, Reddit is the tip of the iceberg.",

Some right wing parents are running for board because there's graphic Woke trans content in the library, which is assessable to 10-13 year old children. There's also a trans club that teachers are persuading children to join, and the parents had no knowledge of this. One student ended up in this trans club instead of Lego club which they intended to join. The parents had no idea, so they were pretty upset when they found out teachers are trying to switch kids into that club. Anyway, the far liberal parents were calling them \"Stupid uneducated imbiciles\" on a community FB group. Then would later go on to preach kindness. Unbelievable.",

For something to be an echo chamber, it means you have no opposition to any of your political ideas and don\u2019t have any different opinions than everyone else, which is FAR from being the case on Reddit if you\u2019re on the right lol. Maybe it could be considered a Republican echo chamber if someone never left conservative subs, but you are constantly inundated with left wing propaganda everywhere else than those handful of subs. \n\nAlso, there are only just a few subs that aren\u2019t dominated by the left on here, but you\u2019ll notice that even in right wing subs, there is plenty of disagreement among people who have the same political leanings. So even if you didn\u2019t ever leave a right wing sub, you\u2019ll still find plenty of differing opinions in those subs. Not quite what I\u2019d call an echo chamber, but hey, what do I know.",

And when it turns out that they only want \"great\" for those that think in lock step with their agendas, and you disagree with their exclusion, you're the enemy.\n\nNever mind that my observations (it's not even a position but rather simply knowing our country's history) are based on history and how we got to BE great.  But these are often the same people that believe that their dogma is better than other people's dogma and that's all that is necessary to hold the moral high ground.\n\n\\#Depressing\n\nIt's late and I'm tired, but I seem to recall a Who song that says something similar; that the (extreme) left and (extreme) right are the same but wearing different makeup, but both are bet on destroying the reasonable people.\n\nFortunately there are more in the classic conservative camp than in the \"lets let government assume all responsibility and control\" camp.\n\n\\#GivesMeHope",
