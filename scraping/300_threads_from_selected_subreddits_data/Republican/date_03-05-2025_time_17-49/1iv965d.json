They would both arguably be \u201cthe mother\u201d so this clarification can be useful in cases like that. Doesn\u2019t seem to be much of a trans issue at all afaik",

So, if a woman, who is in a lesbian marriage sleeps with a man and gets pregnant, the biological father doesn't automatically become the legal guardian of said child. Seems to be an idea to safe lesbian couples some money and headaches when they want a child but I see potential to abuse this law to rob men of their rights as a father.\n\nOh and the wording of the \"inseminated person\" seems to be about trans issues. Otherwise it wouldn't have been necessary to change that.",
