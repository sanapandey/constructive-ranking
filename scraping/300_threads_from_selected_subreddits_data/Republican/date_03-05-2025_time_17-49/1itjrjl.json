There\u2019s little ability for many on either side to compromise or moderate. And even worse I see a lack of tolerance on other side, anyone who isn\u2019t agreeing with you is an enemy.",

It's very misleading. The malcontents on both ends of the spectrum live on social media and while they are *very* \"loud\" they are not a good representation of where the country really is politically.",

Over the ensuing decades though America has kept its doors wide open while other countries have slowly been shutting theirs. Here is where the Democrats were in 1996:\n\n>In the last four years, the Clinton-Gore Administration has signed over 200 trade agreements, including NAFTA and GATT, **to open markets around the world to American products, and create more jobs for the people who make them here at home. We have put in place the most sweeping agreements to lower foreign trade barriers** of any administration in modern American history\n\nOn Education:\n\n>**We restructured federal education programs and eliminated federal regulations to give local schools, teachers, and principals the flexibility and help they need to meet those standards.** In the next four years, we must do even more to make sure America has the best public schools on earth. If we want to be the best, we should expect the best: We must hold students, teachers, and schools to the highest standards. They should be required to meet high standards for professional performance and be rewarded for the good jobs they do. **Schools should be held accountable for results. We should redesign or overhaul schools that fail. We should expand public school choice**\n\n  \n(Looks like I am gonna have to divide this....)",

The violent crime rate and the murder rate had climbed for seven straight years. **Drugs seemed to flow freely across our borders and into our neighborhoods.** Bill Clinton promised to turn things around, and that is exactly what he did. \\[...\\]**to answer the call of America's police officers and pass the toughest Crime Bill in history. The Democratic Party under President Clinton is putting more police on the streets and tougher penalties on the books**; and it is making a difference. In city after city and town after town, crime rates are finally coming down. **The Crime Bill is putting 100,000 new police officers on the street.** We deplore cynical Republican attempts to undermine our promise to America to put 100,000 new police officers on the street. **We pledge to stand up for our communities and stand with our police officers by opposing any attempt to repeal or weaken this effort.**\n\n  \nOn Immigration:\n\n>**We cannot tolerate illegal immigration and we must stop it. In 1992, our borders might as well not have existed.** The border was under-patrolled, and what patrols there were, were under-equipped. Drugs flowed freely. Illegal immigration was rampant. Criminal immigrants, deported after committing crimes in America, returned the very next day to commit crimes again.\n\n>**President Clinton is making our border a place where the law is respected and drugs and illegal immigrants are turned away.** We have increased the Border Patrol by over 40 percent; in El Paso, our Border Patrol agents are so close together they can see each other. **Last year alone, the Clinton Administration removed thousands of illegal workers from jobs across the country.**\n\n\n\nOn DOGE:\n\n>The American people have a right to demand that responsibility is the order of the day in Washington. **The mission of today's Democratic Party is to expand opportunity, not bureaucracy.** We have worked hard over the last four years to rein in big government, slash burdensome regulations, eliminate wasteful programs, and shift problem-solving out of Washington and back to people and communities who understand their situations best.\n\n>In the last four years, President Clinton, working with the National Performance Review chaired by Vice President Gore, **has cut the federal government by almost 240,000 positions, making the smallest federal government in 30 years. The federal government is eliminating 16,000 pages of outdated and unnecessary regulations, has abolished 179 programs and projects, and saved taxpayers billions of dollars.** \n\n>Over the next four years, the Democratic Party will continue to make responsibility the rule in Washington: cutting bureaucracy further, improving customer service, demanding better performance, holding people and agencies accountable for producing the best results, ensuring all Americans have access to high quality public services",

The Administration defense plan reverses the downward trend in procurement with a 40% real increase for weapons modernization by 2001. **At the same time, as part of its reinventing government program, the Administration has fundamentally reformed government procurement rules in order to get the most for our money.** \n\n\n\nOn an Iron Dome:\n\n>The Democratic Party is committed to a strong and balanced National Missile Defense (NMD) program. The Administration is spending $3 billion a year on six different systems to protect our troops in the field and our allies from short and medium range missiles. **To prepare for the possibility of a long range missile attack on American soil by a rogue state, the Clinton Administration is committed to developing by the year 2000 a defensive system that could be deployed by 2003, well before the threat becomes real.**\n\n  \nOn Religion:\n\n>Today's Democratic Party understands that all Americans have a right to express their faith. The Constitution prohibits the state establishment of religion, and it protects the free exercise of religion. The President fought for and signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, to reaffirm the great protection the Constitution gives to religious expression, and to recognize the historic role people of faith have played in America. Americans have a right to express their love of God in public, and we applaud the President's work to ensure that children are not denied private religious expression in school. Whenever the religious rights of our children -- or any American -- are threatened, we will stand against it.",

That is why President Clinton and Vice President Gore took action to order all federal agencies to make sure everything government does for children promotes responsibility from\u00a0all\u00a0parents, fathers as well as mothers.\n\n  \nOn Israel:\n\n>The Democratic Party remains **committed to America's long-standing special relationship with Israel**, based on shared values, a mutual commitment to democracy and a strategic alliance that benefits both nations. The United States should continue to help Israel maintain its qualitative edge. **Jerusalem is the capital of Israel** and should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths. **We are also committed to working with our Arab partners for peace to build a brighter, more secure and prosperous future for all the people of the Middle East.** To that end, we seek to further and enhance our close ties with states and peoples in the Arab and Islamic world committed to non-aggression **and willing to take risks for peace.**\n\n  \nOn the FAA:\n\n>President Clinton asked the Vice President to chair a commission **on the future of air traffic security and safety**. We will work to increase the security of our air travel system, the safety of our airplanes, **and the safety and security of our air traffic control system**.\n\n  \nOn Ukraine:\n\n>Four years ago, the forces of reform in the former Soviet Union were embattled. Today, U.S. initiatives are helping democracy and free markets take root throughout the region, **Russian troops are out of** **~~Ukraine~~** **the Baltics, and democracy has triumphed in** **~~Ukraine~~****'s Russia's elections.**\n\n  \nThe Pitch:\n\n>Now we must move forward, and we know the course we must follow. **We need a smaller, more effective, more efficient, less bureaucratic government that reflects our time-honored values.** The American people do not want big government solutions and they do not want empty promises. They want a government that is for them, not against them; **that doesn't interfere with their lives but enhances their quality of life.** They want a course that is reasonable, help that is realistic, and solutions that can be delivered -- a moderate, achievable, **common-sense agenda** that will improve people's daily lives and not increase the size of government.\n\n  \nHonestly, I think Trump just remembered the 90s and was like \"holy fuck why don't we just go back to doing that\".
