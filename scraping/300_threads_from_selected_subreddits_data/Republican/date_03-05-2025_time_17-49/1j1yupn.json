I think the root cause of 'bejng able to afford foreign aid before we give it' is a big factor. People who can afford homes, cars, medical care, vacations, etc, dont mind sharing the wealth. But when people are working 2 jobs and renting a shitty apartment, can barely keep fed or the lights on and pray daily nothing happens bc they cant go to the doctors, replace a flat tire, etc.. people are much more critical of what their moneys being spent on. A strong economy makes for strong foreign policy.\n\nRemember reagan cut a lot of domestic spending *first*",
