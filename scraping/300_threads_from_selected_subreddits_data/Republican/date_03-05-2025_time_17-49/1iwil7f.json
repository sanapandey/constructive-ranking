            "body": "Best news of the month!\n\nShe is one of the few openly nasty, rude, lying, and racist pieces of \ud83d\udca9 on TV! I'm not saying there aren't any others, but IMO, she and the same type of human pieces of \ud83d\udca9 on \"The View\" are the absolute bottom of the \ud83d\udca9 barrel. \n\nThe funny thing is when I used to watch Whoopi in movies like \"Sister Act,\" I never thought she would turn out to be a person like she is. I don't know if she's always been like she is now, and I just never saw it or saw her in interviews or anything enough to see it, but it sure did shock me When I first saw that show. I've never watched it, but back in 2017-2020, as a live-in nurse, I took care of an older lady who watched it every single day \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0fNow I could never so much as watch one of her movies, knowing what I know about her and how racist and nasty she is!\n\nAt 66, I have four grown children, ages 46, 43, 41, and 31...girls in the middle, and five grandchildren. As a single mom after the early death of their dad, we taught....then it was on me to teach my children to *Know no color in humans,* they are now teaching their children, the same morals and values as they were taught growing up; I also was taught the same.\n\nThere are/were also no *slang* names/terms allowed to be spoken in my home, such as the *N* word, the *F* word, slang for a gay person, and the *R* word, which is now considered derogatory and hurtful but unfortunately, was originally the actual term, for a mentally challenged person.\n\nDuring this day and age, I sometimes wonder, what if I hadn't taught them this way? What if I hadn't been taught this way? Well, I would be so ashamed of myself for being that way or allowing that offensive filth in my home! Part of how I taught them was telling them that if it's something you wouldn't be comfortable saying in front of Jesus, then it's just not right!\n\nMy oldest daughter has been married to an African American man for eight years, and my youngest daughter has one of my two grandsons, who has mild Down syndrome. How hurtful would it be to have my 11-year-old grandson or the others hear someone call him the *R* word? I'm afraid that Gramma-Bear would come out and give him/her a *Come to Jesus* meeting, and then I would end up in jail for knocking the *speaker of the offensive word* out with my cane! God, I'ma die in the meantime...they gonna kill meeeeee, as I'm hitting the floor...but for a good cause \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nSeriously though, no matter where I go or what I'm doing, if I hear somebody using a slang term like that (of course, there are more than the ones I pointed out, but those just stand out as the most used) I have and will call somebody out over that. I detest people using those words because it's just plain wrong. \n\nNow am I wrong, or being hypocritical, for saying that these females *are nasty, rude, lying, and racist pieces of \ud83d\udca9?* I don't think so; there's a huge difference between hurting someone's feelings with words and telling it like it is! I don't know y'all can call me out if you think so \ud83d\udc75\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude01",
