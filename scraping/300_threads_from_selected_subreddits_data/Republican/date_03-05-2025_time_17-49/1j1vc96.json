The fact they think that for this to work they don\u2019t have to sell this idea to Ukrainians. They\u2019ve only been antagonistic with Ukraine on this matter. If the table is US and Russia its not going to do anything. When i hear the president its seems the peace plan is to give Russia what it wants and for Ukraine to give up. Maybe if he would sell it better to Ukrainians, Zelenski would be forced to accept? Right now they must think the US sees peace only happening through capitulation.\n\nB. Why does this admin does not seem to think Ukrainians are 100% morally right in their defense of their full sovereignity the same way Israel is? I think Israel is completely in its right and i don\u2019t see why Ukrainians would not be.",

This however, is better than Ukraine as a whole falling due to an eventual lack of manpower or the start of WW3 because of NATO troop mobilization in the Ukrainian/russian front\n\nB. It\u2019s not about who is morally right or wrong. Trump can\u2019t say whether he thinks Zelensky is in the right or wrong- that would potentially ruin relations with Putin and make a ceasefire deal much harder to initiate. Also, in the case of Israel and Pakistan- neither is a major world power, much less a nuclear power. The issue with this is we are playing with Russian imperialism and Nuclear war, we have to be much more careful.",

That this is win-win-win for Ukraine, Russia and the US.\n\nThat\u2019s what i mean by \u2018selling them the idea\u2019.

Sign a mineral deal\u2026it\u2019s not for the money\u2026.we don\u2019t need his minerals. But what that does is give us leverage with Russia. Because we now would have a vested interest in Ukraine not being overtaken by Russia. This puts Russia in a tough position. Then what. You need to give the Russians something to save face. You have to give some of the bordering property to Russia that they have old claims to. Yes people will be displaced but you get the Russians to pay for the re-location. You divide a new border. You build a wall paid for by Russia. Russia provides much needed oil to Ukraine. You sign a deal with any future advancements beyond the wall that it is an act of War whereas the US and our weak EU friend commit to. This isn\u2019t that herd folks. Did the Russians invade them.? Yes they did. Should they have? No. Did we have a President (Biden) who was an idiot and woke? Yes. Fact is it happened. Know there is a new negotiation. If your wife does something wrong in your opinion do you keep bringing it up over and over and hold the line. No you both agree to move on even if you think you\u2019re right. It\u2019s frustrating to me how dumb people are in general.",

Even our Congress has referred to the Ukraine as ' NATO+' and has foolishly taunted Russia with NATO membership for the Ukraine. Perhaps a compromise would be the establishment of a 'EU police force' to provide security to the Ukraine without NATO involvement.",
