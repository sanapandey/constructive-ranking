Being a solider while being blind or having schizophrenia or something like that... yikes, nobody should have to experience that. As someone with a certain genetic condition which doesn't seriously impair me but would still require me to get a waiver if I wanted to enlist, I wouldn't want to be in the military anyway. I'm on a med to manage my genetic condition, and when I don't have access to the med for longer periods of time, it starts causing issues, and I'm at risk of actually being seriously impaired, like as in paralysis from the waist down, or worse.",

People with gender dysphoria are 80% more likely to have suicidal ideations (this is a fact). In the military, we call them Suicidal Related Behavior (SRB). If you have an SRB, you are no longer in a deployable status and it can take months or years to clear the individual. In the cases I have seen (which is sadly more than I care to have seen), we have needed to medically process out these sailors for SRBs. \n\nI do not doubt their resolve and or their commitment to serve.",

Most of the pencil type jobs are filled by civilians (GS employees) not soldiers (or airmen or sailors or whatever your flavor is)\n\nRegardless of what your job is, the military is a constant stress pool. There\u2019s a reason that the medical standards exist. It\u2019s also not so much that we can get soldiers to join, it\u2019s that we can\u2019t get them to stay in",
