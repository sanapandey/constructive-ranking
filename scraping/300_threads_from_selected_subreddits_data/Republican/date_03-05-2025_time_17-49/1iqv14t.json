(Sorry in advance for my formatting I\u2019m on my phone \ud83d\ude05)\n\n\u2022\t\u20601973: The US DOJ\u2014 under the Nixon administration, out of all administrations \u2014 sued the Trump Management Corporation for violating the Fair Housing Act. Federal officials found evidence that Trump had refused to rent to Black tenants and lied to Black applicants about whether apartments were available, among other accusations.\n\u2022\t\u20601980s: Kip Brown, a former employee at Trump\u2019s Castle, accused another one of Trump\u2019s businesses of discrimination. \u201cWhen Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt was the eighties, I was a teenager, but I remember it: They put us all in the back.\u201d\n\u2022\t\u20601989: In a controversial case that\u2019s been characterized as a modern-day lynching, four Black teenagers and one Latino teenager \u2014 the \u201cCentral Park Five\u201d \u2014 were accused of attacking and raping a jogger in New York City. Trump immediately took charge in the case, running an ad in local papers demanding, \u201cBRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE!\u201d The teens\u2019 convictions were later vacated after they spent seven to 13 years in prison, and the city paid $41 million in a settlement to the teens. But Trump in October 2016 said he still believes they\u2019re guilty, despite the DNA evidence to the contrary.\n\u2022\t\u20601991: A book by John O\u2019Donnell, former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, quoted Trump\u2019s criticism of a Black accountant: \u201cBlack guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. \u2026 I think that the guy is lazy. And it\u2019s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It\u2019s not anything they can control.\u201d Trump later said in a 1997 Playboy interview that \u201cthe stuff O\u2019Donnell wrote about me is probably true.\u201d\n\u2022\t\u20601992: The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino had to pay a $200,000 fine because it transferred Black and women dealers off tables to accommodate a big-time gambler\u2019s prejudices.\n\u2022\t\u20601993: In congressional testimony, Trump said that some Native American reservations operating casinos shouldn\u2019t be allowed because \u201cthey don\u2019t look like Indians to me.\u201d\n\u2022\t\u20602000: In opposition to a casino proposed by the St. Regis Mohawk tribe, which he saw as a financial threat to his casinos in Atlantic City, Trump secretly ran a series of ads suggesting the tribe had a \u201crecord of criminal activity [that] is well documented.\u201d\n\u2022\t\u20602004: In season two of The Apprentice, Trump fired Kevin Allen, a Black contestant, for being overeducated. \u201cYou\u2019re an unbelievably talented guy in terms of education, and you haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d Trump said on the show. \u201cAt some point you have to say, \u2018That\u2019s enough.\u2019\u201d\n\u2022\t\u20602005: Trump publicly pitched what was essentially The Apprentice: White People vs. Black People. He said he \u201cwasn\u2019t particularly happy\u201d with the most recent season of his show, so he was considering \u201can idea that is fairly controversial \u2014 creating a team of successful African Americans versus a team of successful whites. Whether people like that idea or not, it is somewhat reflective of our very vicious world.\u201d\n\u2022\t\u20602010: In 2010, there was a huge national controversy over the \u201cGround Zero Mosque\u201d \u2014 a proposal to build a Muslim community center in Lower Manhattan, near the site of the 9/11 attacks. Trump opposed the project, calling it \u201cinsensitive,\u201d and offered to buy out one of the investors in the project. On The Late Show With David Letterman, Trump argued, referring to Muslims, \u201cWell, somebody\u2019s blowing us up. Somebody\u2019s blowing up buildings, and somebody\u2019s doing lots of bad stuff.\u201d\n\u2022\t\u20602011: Trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that Obama \u2014 the country\u2019s first Black president \u2014 was not born in the US. He claimed to send investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama\u2019s birth certificate. Obama later released his birth certificate, calling Trump a \u201ccarnival barker.\u201d The research has found a strong correlation between birtherism, as the conspiracy theory is called, and racism. But Trump has reportedly continued pushing this conspiracy theory in private.\n\u2022\t\u20602011: While Trump suggested that Obama wasn\u2019t born in the US, he also argued that maybe Obama wasn\u2019t a good enough student to have gotten into Columbia or Harvard Law School, and demanded Obama release his university transcripts. Trump claimed, \u201cI heard he was a terrible student. Terrible. How does a bad student go to Columbia and then to Harvard?\u201d\n\nHow do these things make you feel confident he isn\u2019t a racist?",
