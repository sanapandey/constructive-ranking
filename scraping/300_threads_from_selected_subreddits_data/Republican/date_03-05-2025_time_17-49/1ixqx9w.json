It was a stalemate at best either way with continuing casualties on both sides.

Optics wise, it would have looked like the Trump administration had no position or interest in this conflict. Which could be interpreted as a sign of weakness as opposed to taking any other stance. Either way, optics wise the criticism against the US would have sustained either way. Both Obama and Biden took a similar position, not wanting to engage in Ukrainian NATO membership. Even prior to the full invasion.\n\nOnly Former President Bush Jr. suggested a NATO membership in 2004. But it never happened.\n\nThe US and most of our Western allies do not trust the Ukrainian government to be allowed into NATO due to major corruption issues. This has been going on since 2008. Zelensky has made this clear that Trump did not start this issue (I mention this because of bias political articles that will spread here within the US). \n\nAdditionally, and arguably more so, the diplomatic language of a NATO membership in Ukraine would allow NATO forces to push towards Russia\u2019s borders. This language, by Russia, would then be interpreted as an act of aggression. At this time, beyond the US contributions, the European NATO allies combined have matched the totals given by the US.\n\nSo why attack Ukraine and how to justify this unjust and violent campaign against it? Beyond the rhetoric campaign launched against Ukraine by Russia, which is comprised of the Russian view that Ukraine is part of Russia historically, and an intention to defeat \u201cneo-nazism\u201d in the Ukrainian region. There has been a desire to access the waterways around Ukraine, part of which were obtained by the capture of Crimea in 2014 but the full intensions were ambiguous and never fully explained. We can only speculate on Putin\u2019s ambitions.\n\nI agree with the tone of frustration in your questions. This should had never of happened. This is why I hope Trump can leverage the situation and maybe provide proposals that will be mutual to a ceasefire and then maybe a withdrawal from all regions capture post-2014. I do believe that Crimea is officially off the table.",

Let's quickly remind ourselves of a couple of key points:\n\n* Zelenskyy was at the heart of Trump's impeachment case in his first term with the F-16/Hunter Biden boondoggle.\n* Zelenskyy was openly critical about what would happen to Ukraine if Trump was elected.\n* Zelenskyy is openly critical of Trump's dealings with Putin and Russia.\n* Zelenskyy flat out refused the mineral rights deal that Trump put in front / demanded of him.\n* Trump immediately posted a hate filled rant about him after he refused the mineral deal, but before the UN vote.\n\nWe already know Trump is soft on Putin and was pretty openly hostile to Zelenskyy over the years (calling him a beggar and all that), and he now feels Zelenskyy was and is *personally* attacking him and openly defying him...something that frankly, Trump simply cannot abide. Zelenskyy is Trump's bad apple that he just can't seem to get rid of.\n\nThe mineral deal was a test...either prove your fealty or face the wrath, and Zelenskyy defied him. His angry post about Zelenskyy being a dictator, etc. afterward was, in my opinion, the indicator that Trump was going to start hammering on Zelenskyy.\n\nCombine all that together and I think it's pretty clear why the UN vote went the way it did. Trump is emotional and leads by his gut, and his gut is pretty damn angry with Zelenskyy at the moment. I'm pretty sure it's going to stay that way until Zelenskyy capitulates to Trump on *something*, war with Russia be damned.",

There\u2019s a world where Joe Biden or a Democrat does the same thing and it\u2019s just not a big deal\n\nThe problem with Trump is that while younger republicans are 100% pro-isolationist. A lot of older maga folks, as much as they hate the democrats. Just cannot reconcile this cozy-ing up to Putin. Especially because it\u2019s not masked with half truths or nuances. But instead our right, preposterous lies. That only he can get away with for himself, not for the other dictators\n\nThere was a similar \u201cevil axis\u201d when it came to the Palestine/Israel stuff. The people were wrong and the US was right to vote with Israel then, and I\u2019m not mad that they did with Russia now. But if the end is total surrender and abandonment similar to Afghanistan.

Their economy cannot sustain indefinite war. Russia wants this war to end so that their economy doesn't collapse, but they can't end the war from a position of stalemate or defeat as that would mean the end of Putin. Trump is giving Russia a lifeline to end the war from a position of strength and help repair their economy - do you understand how rewarding Russia despite them being the aggressor in this conflict would set a terrible precedent for Russia's future actions?",

Not to mention Russia continued support for countries that remain highly critical of the US. \n\nIt's not your fight? Well, Trump believes the US is responsible for starting the war. His own words. \n\nWorld police? That was a propoganda Bush invented to invade Iraq for WMDs. He was also the one to invent the whole \"they criticise us, so they must be false allies\" in response to France rejecting to join invasion of Iraq.(remember the \"freedom fries\" nonsense?) Even though France was among the first nations to come to US's aid when US triggered article 5 after 9/11.\n\nDo you think Ukraine has been a bad ally? A country that has been involved in helping US and was present in most of US interventions post cold war?\n\nYou don't want to be a world police? That's fine. But US as a country that has enlisted international aid numerous times for it's own idiotic wars such as war on terror, war on drugs, etc, the absolute bare fucking minimum that most countries should be able to expect of US is not blatantly spreading misinformation(like saying Zelensky has 4% approval, a lie not backed by even Russian sources) and side with the aggressors! It literally cost the US tax payers 0-cents for Trump to not say Russia had the right to invade Ukraine. It might even expose Americans to more risk if Trump continues to insist on saying shit like the US created ISIS or NATO caused Russian aggression.",
