I wonder how all the Muslim Americans and others who listened to her irrational babbling who didn't vote, or voted for Trump are feeling now. And do we hear anything from Tlaib about this? Of course not! She did it to please her Muslim-American base to insure her re-election. I'm sure she cared about Palestinians, but her behavior was reprehensible and she should be held responsible for it.",

Then the worsening conditions in the US will force American Jews to 'flee to safety' in Israel, where the only places for them to live are now Trump owned. And at the same time, this fits the Evangelical narrative of the second coming if the Jews return to Israel, so it's win-win for the Christian Nationalists, too.\"",

Con's literally control all three branches of government, AND the supreme court, they have total control of the country, and yet it's still somehow democrats fault. Ignore the fact they have literally 0 power to \"fight back\", we as a country made sure that was the case when we voted in the conservatives to the house and senate, and gave Trump another term. A dem tries to stand up to him? Get's removed from Congress and censured. Dem judges try to stop him? He ignores them, and the supreme court does nothing. But yup, it's dems fault, you're right.\n\nWriting articles about this isn't about \"people who support trump\", they're all lost and in a literal cult, they will NEVER change their opinion of their god-emperor. It's moreso important for the LARGE majority of the country who are politically checked out, and spout the \"both side are the same\" narrative, it's helping these people understand how deranged Trump is, and how much of an actual threat he is, and how no democrats are the \"same\" as republicans, especially the MAGA freaks currently in control of the country.",

Considering nothing will actually happen when Republican control all three chambers of government, and the Supreme court. \n\nWhat do you want Dems to actually do outside of what (most) of them are doing now? (Calling out trump, trying to raise alarm bells that this isn't okay/normal, judges trying to block illegal orders that Trump just ignores, trying to block bills in Congress which is almost impossible considering they hold 0 power there with reps controlling both the senate and house by a pretty big margin, etc.).

But I was not the president or vice president of the United States who directed American foreign policy up until January 2025. They had a different opinion and clearly believed that supporting Israel in its endeavors was worth the risk of turning the country over to Trump. Perhaps you agreed with them or naively believed we could enable this  and only the Palestinians would pay the price. Whatever guilt you\u2019re feeling for your part is yours and well deserved.",

This new poll confirms the ineffectiveness of these attacks.\n\n> Nationally, 64% of voters recall seeing an anti-trans attack ad against Kamala Harris. But just 4%\u2014dead last on this list\u2014 identify opposing surgeries for trans people and trans kids\u2019 participation in sports as issues motivating them to vote. (This aligns with research Gallup found in September). In fact, when asked directly which candidate \u201drepresents your views on transgender people,\u201d voters pick Harris (52 to 40 percent).\n\nSo no, the GOP wanting to kill us didn't win them the election. Kamala saying \"I will follow the law\" didn't lose her the election. Don't just give up ground to nazi rhetoric. If they can get you to believe that trans issues lost Harris the election, they can convince you that we're not worth fighting for.\n\nThe democrats actually had an extremely easy choice to make: Support trans people and lose 0 votes, or waffle about whether 1% of the population is really worth defending and gain 0 votes from doing so. So they chose the less humane option and now we have redditors equivocating about whether trans rights are really worth defending on the public stage.",

The world as a whole should be fighting against what is occuring in Ukraine and in Gaza. Why has it always been the US's responsibility? I am a liberal through and through, but also a centrist. I am also a citizen born New Yorker. When I became homeless even with a job, I was denied services and was not given resources. I was turned away when I went to shelters and gov't agencies. When we were inundated with immigrants in NYC, they received housing in luxury hotels and food cards & paid meals. Can you imagine how much that hurt me? I can imagine why so many people suddenly had hatred in their heart for illegal immigrants. I love all people & have no hate for people I don't know. They needed those services and I am happy to have some of my taxes help them. But where were these services when I was \\*still actively paying taxes\\*? This is why \"America first\" won. But it was a complete ruse to those who can't see behind the veil. He had no intention of making America first. Trump is like that abusive boyfriend who promises you the world. He gives you flowers, tell you you are beautiful, says you will be the most important thing in the world. Then you marry him, and he isolates you from all of your family & friends. He tells you they have it out for you, that only he can protect you. And guess what? You stay with him for the better half of your life because he does rpotect you...by following you, by putting tracking on your phone, & deciding your every move. The United States is in an abusive relationship with Trump.",

And that would be a majority of the Jewish community because Jesus never fit the criteria for the Jewish Messiah and never will to Jews (except if you\u2019re a Jew for Jesus I suppose).\n\nIt\u2019s ironic how much Trump and the Christians are suppressing others for their antisemitism, when they wouldn\u2019t touch their Fundamentalists or Evangelicals in their ranks for believing way worse (though the antisemitism is just a piss poor dictatorial excuse to crack down on the free speech the Right doesn\u2019t like. What a fucked up timeline we live in).\n\nAnyway, I always post [this Vice video on the topic](https://youtu.be/Fo77sTGpngQ?si=5ezsf6iPbdSe5p9I) if people wanna learn more.

That's not how any of this works and it's actually you who isn't going to change electoral reality no matter how much you stamp your feet and insist you must be allowed to nominate fascists.

Voters didn\u2019t have a choice of who the dem leadership put up. What we did have a choice on was to allow another Trump presidency. I notice you completely glazed over the privilege portion, seems I was right on that one. Looking forward to more legal citizens getting disappeared? Go out there and protest!\n\nAgain, you will NEVER make changes if you don\u2019t start from the ground up. Instead, you\u2019ve sacrificed American citizens AND accelerated the genocide all for\u2026 the moral high ground? Hope you feel proud I guess.",

Ergo, neither is much better than the other. It's a wash. \n\nUnless you're going to argue that Trump is secretly good for Palestine, in which case, I yield the floor for you to make your case. \n\nOtherwise, if both are equally bad, then other issues need to be considered. \n\nAre you happy with the Trump Presidency?   You good with his position with Ukraine? Are you in favor of the expanded fossil fuel use he's promised? Are you good with LGBTQ people being erased from society? Are you good with the military and law enforcement rounding people up to be deported even when a U.S. judge tells them to stop? Are you in favor of Trump's trade wars and threats to annex Greenland and invade Panama?\n\nBecause you must be okay with ALL of these things in aggregate, in fact they must be a bonus, for you to pick him over Biden-Harris.. especially since you believe they all were pretty much equally bad for the Palestinians. \n\nAre you happy with what people who think like you wrought on the world? Did you make the wise choice, or just the one that flatters your ego?",

The whole city's been destroyed, it's nothing but rubble for miles on end. Saying that Biden wasn't great with that issue is an insulting understatement of a momentous proportion. \n\n>Trump has publicly called for the United States top annex Gaza and forcibly remove all Palestinians, ffs. From the White House.\n\nThe Israelis were likely going to do the same under Kamala, just with more subtlety. \n\nI never said that people should vote for Trump or that I would have. But I understand why people on the left, particularly Palestinian Americans didn't vote for Kamala. Both candidates were dark horses when it came to the Issue of Gaza, but atleast Trump was offering a ceasefire. I can see why they went for him for the sake of their family's lives in spite of all the policies they don't agree with. Similarly, you voted for Biden depite his policy on Gaza. \n\nAlso, I disagree with this notion that no matter how bad a candidate is, they deserve your vote simply because the alternative is worse. By your logic, people should still vote even if the Democrat was only .1% less evil than the Republican. How can you expect your nation to improve with this line of thinking, by telling the dems that as long as they're not quite as bad as the opposition they get the votes? \n\nThe dems should not have backed a genocide, and they should run on promises that actually resonate with the left. It's their own fault that they lost, so don't blame the Arabs or more fringe leftists just because they could not stomach voting for the party that aided a genocide.",

It is perhaps the only issue in the US that is wholly bipartisan, where both parties will outdo each other trying to prove they are more loyal to Israel than the other.\n\nAt this point. Seems like Americans seem happy to blame their domestic Trump situation on Muslim voters in the US, and revel in the punishment of Palestinians as some sort of payback.\n\nAnd you wonder why even if and when Trump is gone, even if and when a Democrat is back in power. You will still be reviled by many countries. Both on the border and much further afield.",

And if the media knows that the way the current at the time protests would only damage Biden or Harris not actually move policy then why did the folks organizing them not know?\n\nAnd where did I say I was ok with this happening? I said that a) this was a nearly obvious outcome of Trump got elected and b) any attempt to say that the heavy handed tactics of the trump admin towards protesters to not go with the same frequency or intensity as was done under the Biden admin shows the belief to the importance of the cause was waffer thin at best.",

Withholding your vote for a candidate most aligned with your viewpoint gives the candidate least aligned with your viewpoint a decisive edge.\n\nYou can certainly be displeased with Biden/Harris for not doing enough, but you also have to realize we live in a world of political realities. If Biden/Harris swung so hard to the left on this issue, they risked alienating the center, pushing those votes towards Trump, enthroning him as the savior of Israel.\n\nBiden wasn\u2019t insensitive to the Palestinian cause, too. He\u2019s been in favor of a 2-state solution and tried to reel in Netanyahu diplomatically. Perhaps he could have done more, but Biden\u2019s instincts were not to escalate the war in Gaza, and was trying to limit it. Hamas has also been a bad actor. Hamas and Israel were brought into the same room multiple times trying to hash out ceasefire agreements Hamas walked away from or didn\u2019t negotiate in good faith. Of course, same with Israel.\n\nBut in no reality is any American politician going to take a militant pro-Palestinian position. Especially with the rhetoric Hamas, the governmental authority in Gaza, spews. It\u2019s not politically defensible in the US. It\u2019s not going to help you win national elections.\n\nThat\u2019s what I don\u2019t get about the anti-Biden/Harris vote on Palestine. You have to jump through so many illogical hoops to withhold your vote. Politically, you\u2019re weakening your position and standing when the other guy, Trump, gets elected.\n\nAlso, look. I\u2019ve voted for several Democrats I don\u2019t agree with across the entirety of their policy positions or platforms. We all don\u2019t get what we want. And while I completely agree progressive tax codes don\u2019t inspire the same sort of passion as vulnerable populations getting slaughtered, you could still vote for Harris and openly protest her administration\u2019s inaction.\n\nAnd look what\u2019s happening now. The Trump administration is leaning hard against any pro-Palestinian protests. He\u2019s seeking retribution against anyone anti-Israel using the guise of \u201canti-semitism\u201d to lean on institutions amenable to pro-Palestinian causes.\n\nAs painful as it sounds, by withholding your vote, you voted for this. This should be a lesson learned moment. Like when the GOP kept promoting fringe whacko nut jobs in winnable Senate and House races because they were ideologically pure, and lost miserably in slam dunk races they should have won if they put up a normal candidate.\n\nThis is just how politics works. And the Pro-Palestinian crowd played their hand extremely poorly, losing whatever moral high ground in the \u201cprimary\u201d, and ending up in a much weaker position in the overall American political narrative.",

Not voting in an election with stakes this high or voting third party when you know who will probably win because of that is a choice, you do not get to escape responsibility for your choice, now we have a trump presidency and have to deal with the consequences to that. Voting for someone who inspires you is detached from reality and often not the case, it\u2019s immature to thnk of it that way. These same people are probably otherwise totally uninvolved and then just complain when things aren\u2019t perfect for them, totally immature.",

Good luck with the orange man, he is indeed one of the most vile people alive today, but that does not mean the previous administration was not commiting atrocities, at best it means they had a better facade.\n\n  \nMaybe if they put someone like Bernie Sanders or Dean Phillips for campaign the Democrats could have swindled those votes, but they dug that grave themselves",

If information presented on a reviewable site cannot be confirmed nor refuted, what happens to that information? Absolutely nothing. Just because something is published on a peer reviewed site does not mean it has been reviewed and just an FYI that is the same journal site in which an article was published showing correlation between vaccines and autism which remained for over ten years and was sited thousands of times before being redacted as unsubstantiated. \n\nFour of the authors own sources state the initial estimates we are seeing are accurate. One states war deaths can be underestimated if not accounting for indirect deaths and from that they deduce \"such indirect deaths range from three to 15 times the number of direct deaths. Applying a conservative estimate of four indirect deaths per one direct death to the 37\u2009396 deaths reported, it is not implausible to estimate that up to 186\u2009000\" which you take as fact. I personally estimate the deaths are 15 times the number of reported deaths by Hamas, so it's actually 720,000 dead Palestinians. Now it's a fact, source that going forward.

It sucked out the air of media coverage at the end of the campaign, and Trump could promise everything to both the Palestinians and to the Israelis because be was not in power and wasn't forced to make any decisions. He played the salesman and y'all bought into it.\n\nFFS Arabs for Trump was putting out targeted ads attacking the Democrats before the election.

How can you not see this?\n\nWhere are the Palestinian protesters on campuses now? Trump green-lights attacks that left 400 Palestinians DEAD. And now people like you don't care. They take zero action.\n\nThe Trump administration announces it will tolerate no Pro-Palestinian demonstrations, deports prominent members, and target universities that allowed those protest with loss of federal funds.\n\nAnd the anti-Harris, pro-Palestine movement is again, strangely silent.\n\nif both parties are 'equally bad', why does that not translate into an equal protest response?\n\nPalestinians and the pro-Palestinian protesters were callously used by the conservative movement, and now that those protesters are not longer needed, they've happily been but back on the shelf. They stay home, write an article here or there, and post online... but the death toll in Palestine is still rising.. 400+ just today.... and you all aren't doing DICK to protest the Republican party, which now has the ACTUAL power to back Israel or back peace.\n\nIf you cared, you'd still care...  you'd still be doing something about it.\n\nYou don't, and you aren't.  You don't care about the people of Palestine now. Perhaps you never really cared about them.  if you did.. that would not have melted away after an American election.\n\nTrump signs off on an Israeli attack that kills 400+ Palestinians.   \nWhat are you going to do next to prevent that from happening again?\n\nI bet nothing at all.",

Its about of the two options, who do I think would handle the situation the best? The \"own the other team\" trolls on both sides are idiots whos opinions can be ignored. They are a loud minority. The exceeding majority of both parties do not care about \"owning\" the other team.\n\nNo one has an answer for the middle east. At this point both sides have *for centuries* committed horrible atrocities. At this point everyone is in the wrong. Israel 100% had the right to defend themselves after 10/7. You dont get to kill 1200 people as a state body and not see reprisal. I support Israel going to war with HAMAS. \n\nThe issue I and most other people on the planet have with the situation is *how* Israel has gone about conducting that war.  \n\nThe middle east is a shit show that no one has any kind of clue how to handle. \n\nTrump/biden/obama/bush/clinton/bush/regan/carter/ford, ad nauseum. None of them had any clue on how to actually bring meaningful peace to the middle east. Chances are no one ever will. \n\nRadical Islam is incompatible with any kind of other culture. Even if we pushed a button and gave all of the land Israel has away. All that would happen is the Caliphate would look outwards. Radical Islam doesnt stop until the world is all under Sharia law. Then they just turn on each other for not being true believers. Its another flavor of dictatorship. They need to be eradicated. Its only end game is tribal warfare and the collapse of society. \n\nAt the same time the west just decided at the end of ww2 that this land smack in the middle of the predominantly muslim region. Is jewish land. If tomorrow where you live was declared at gunpoint to be the land of another peoples and get out or die. You would be pretty upset about that and many would rather fight and die. Which while simplified has led to the current state of affairs.\n\nOf the two choices we had this time. Its pretty clear, while she had valid criticisms of Palestine Kamala was the more level headed. There is a reason why Israel *dramatically* escalated their tactics and aggression once trump got into office. \n\nHAMAS doesnt get to get away with killing innocent 1200 people. There are consequences for that. Israel doesnt get to get away with killing and unknown number of tens of thousands of innocent people. There are consequences for that.\n\nedit: I hit send way before I was ready too.",

I think you and I agree on a lot more than you think.\n\nIf that is something you want to do, have an adult conversation where people can make mistakes. See their mistakes and change their stance and that is not only allowed. But a good thing. Not a gotcha that \"dunks\" on the other. Im here for it. I would like to reiterate my point while also directly addressing, not avoiding yours. Then recenter at the end.\n\nI was directly addressing people who abstained on moral grounds from voting for kamala. With very poor emotional and reactionary word choice. To me it was pretty obvious if you cared about Palestinian lives. Of the two choices Kamala was the better choice. Even if it was not a perfect choice. I stand by that. Not voting for the lesser of two evils is wrong. Fuck the DNC as a whole and fuck Biden for not stepping down so we can have a proper primary. You vote your heart in the primary. You vote with your brain in the general. Its bullshit we didnt get a primary. But this is the real world and you dont let trump into power because you dont like the dramatically lesser evil. Thats letting the greater evil into power. Which is objectively worse.\n\nWe are getting pulled in 9 directions and having several conversations at once and its causing a lot of confusion. I would like to separate them and respond to them to straighten my stances out and you can understand my intent better. Not that you have to agree with it. But lets get rid of assumptions.\n\n-------\n\n\nWe are having a \"Who is at fault\" conversation. At this point there is no innocent side. Regardless of who committed the first wrong. Even if we had a magic ball and could see the first transgression. If we are talking about the conflict as a whole that has spanned generations and involves multiple cultures and multiple different peoples and governments and militias and armed nation states. It doesnt matter. The justification of the original transgressed party is so far beyond meaningless at this point its irrelevant. In that regard no party involved has any kind of valid casus belli in the grand scheme of things. So unfortunately there is no clear ethical choice here. Im not saying in anyway that is justification for any party to continue. I was merely stating that no party can claim moral high ground and thus just cause at this point.\n\nWe are also having a \"Is criticism of one side, implicit approval of all actions of the other side?\" conversation. Just because I support a military response for 10/7 does not mean I am ok with dropping jadams on apartment buildings. Or starving people to death. Or any of the other awful tactics some of which are objective war crimes that Israel has taken.\n\nI could really expand on my objections to Israel  on the topic of the conflict going from 10/7 to today if you want. Its long. But if not the short version is at this point Israel's actions are by far and away worse than 10/7 many many times over. Saying retaliation for 10/7 was justified is not automatic and implicit approval for any and all actions ever taken or to be taken for the rest of the conflict. They are the aggressor at this point and should not be supported.\n\nWe are also having a \"Yeah, we\u2019re not going to agree on the lack of culpability in the Israel-Gaza conflict you\u2019re attempting to ascribe to present and former US Presidents when we\u2019ve directly funded Israel\u2019s military for decades\". Which **ironically I think you and I agree very strongly on this point.** I strongly object and have called my senators over the decades on this topic many times. I dont support arms of any kind going to the Israel. Honestly not even defensive munitions like the iron dome at this point. Israel has an awful apartheid history. They have arguably committed some forms of genocide. They use support from the west to bully those around them in an offensive (as in offensive/defensive, not stinky or uncouth), antagonistic manner. They have long lost any kind of moral grounds to stand on to ask for lethal aid. \n\nWe are also having a \"Is not voting for Kamala on moral grounds and making it easier for trump to win ethical?\" conversation. Which I have made my stance clear on this.\n\nWe are also having a \"If you\u2019re happy being the type that throws their hands up in the air while saying \u201cit\u2019s a bloody history, nobody knows how to solve it!\u201d while your government directly funds the deaths of thousands of civilian men, women, and children on a specific side\". Which I have again made pretty clear im not ok with it. My argument of \"You should have voted for harris because trump is much worse.\" does not automatically mean im ok with the military industrial complex making billions off bombing not-white people. I have been very, very, vocal about that on other social media posts and in person which its fair you dont know that. My stance has not been stated until now. Circling back to the \"We are having a \"Is criticism of one side, implicit approval of all actions of the other side?\" conversation.\n\nWe are also having a \"Am I ok with the US sending arms that result in massive civilian casualties regardless of who is president?\" conversation. Which see above. No. Im not ok with it. Who is president doesnt matter. The original intent, with poor word choice was \"Kamala would not have approved this new weapon, the conflict is worse with far more innocent deaths. With trump in power.\"\n\nPlus a few more conversations but honestly but thats the gist of it. All of this crossing and intersecting is making this conversation fall apart and become meaningless. If you genuinely wish to continue a conversation. I am all for it. But as I said above we need to recenter it.\n\nSo in an attempt to do that.\n\n-----------\n\n\nNot voting for Harris on moral grounds regarding the Israel/Palestine conflict was not logical. The two party system sucks. The DNC suck, a lot. I can, and have written essays on that topic. But even with all of that being true. Letting trump into the white house was objectively worse and easily apparent to everyone not in his cult.",

So it's also not impossible.\n\nI think you might be confusing reports of *internal* displacement with people having left Gaza. Much of the Palastinian population within Gaza became displaced refugees during this war (many fleeing to the largest settlements on the Palestinian side of the Egyptian border, such as Rafah), but they're still within Gazan territory. \n\nThe Gazan population at the start of the war was around 2.3 million people. The population today is around 1.9 to 2.1 million people.\n\nAlternatively you might be conflating the Palestinian refugee diaspora in total with this war in particular - there are millions of Palestinians classified as refugees owing to displacement dating back to 1948 and events through to modern day.\n\nIn short - no, it is not impossible, but the vast majority of the population has been prevented from leaving. Many might have looked to escape if it was possible, but they haven't been allowed.",
