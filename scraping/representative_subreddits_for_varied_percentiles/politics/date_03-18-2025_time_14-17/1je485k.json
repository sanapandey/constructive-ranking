To harm others without recourse, even by proxy, is a form of power over them and to a reactionary power and status are the same thing.\n\nIn a zero sum way, they feel better about their position in society if they see people they already look down on being degraded through cruelty and harm, especially if it is done through official institutions. The social hierarchy that they feel exists, becomes real, and so does their perception of being relatively privileged and protected within it. That is the motivation behind the cruelty.",

I think he's absolutely a narcissist and I think his cognitive abilities are in decline but I don't think that explains his behavior really. There are times when he makes erratic posts on social media and erratic decisions that later get ignored or walked back and I think that's all Trump craziness. There are other times, most of the time in fact, that his choices are in line with things that seem planned and calculated. His policies and the things he's been doing since in office seem to be in line with two things imo. Russia and the Project 2025 documents. I think he had/has people in his ear. Everything he's doing is destabilizing and isolating the US. They are destroying every alliance they have, they are destroying their economy, they are destroying all checks and balances that could step in to stop this stuff from happening and ramping up. I don't really think Trump even understands. I think he probably thinks the things he's doing are coming from smart people and he just likes the policies because he's also racist, cruel and a shitty human. I don't think he came up with the plans for all of this, though. You honestly couldn't come up with a better plan if you wanted to destroy the US from within. It's scary.",

But if someone is in a gang and chooses to do a drive by, killing and injuring multiple people some who were the intended targets and others who were just bystanders\u2026 how frequently do they get treated with anger because they are narcissists or that an entire community thinks they are suffering from madness?\n\nWhat I\u2019m getting at is, narcissistic or not, his actions and decisions are his own. Sure, dementia can often make people angry and mean, with tendencies to be volatile in their decision making, but of the people suffering from dementia who I have known, none of them went from being regular, compassionate, empathetic people to suddenly extremely racist, hate fueled, idiots who state made up facts about scientific and medical things. My step dad was a physician, then he suffered from dementia. His knowledge and understanding of medical reason never went from him being a normal, good doctor to him telling someone that in order to cure a disease they should drink disinfectants like bleach. He lost knowledge, memories stopped sticking, and he would wonder off for some strange and illogical reasons. But, he could seriously be an asshole before the dementia and he was an asshole with dementia. Surprisingly, he also became more kind more frequently with dementia.\n\nAll of that to say, it feels like people are blaming his actions on his mental health rather than just on his personality, upbringing, and core belief system. It is what it is, Trump is a person who does not show empathy but knows what decisions he makes. He\u2019s been that way. He is a convicted felon from an event much earlier in his life, was that due to his \u201cmadness\u201d and dementia? Had dementia already set in 30 years ago and that\u2019s what caused him to take many trips with his friend Epstein? Or, is he just a terrible person to other human beings, not because of his mental health? If it\u2019s a mental health problem like narcissistic tendencies, rather than dementia, then most likely there would be some medication and therapy that could be prescribed. If he took the medication and did the therapy, do you think he would come back in 6months with a completely new approach and apologize for his actions and condemn Nazis and Project 2025? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how it works. \n\nI\u2019m sick of blaming his actions on something other than who he is. Call it out, call it by what it truly is. Trump is a tyrant, a traitor, and a terrible person. \n\nNot my king. Not my tyrant.",

In fact I think he will talk about annexing Mexico next. Eventually to dissuade folks over those fears (basically these rants are a test to see how it can be taken) the plan will be more install puppet governments with the end goal of using them for labor and manufacturing hubs. The steps taken will be similar to what\u2019s happening to federal agencies and federal employees here. This is where Peter Thiel/Palantir comes in. Using AI to replace federal employees and advanced software like Palantir to run the day to day operations of the intelligence agencies and armies in those countries (explanation below about the U.S. and UK along with links). The folks behind Trump are Peter Theil/Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the standard technique of privatization: Defund, make sure things don\u2019t work, People get angry, you hand it over to private capital\u201d\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/26/elon-musk-peter-thiel-apartheid-south-africa\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/02/seeing-stones-pandemic-reveals-palantirs-troubling-reach-in-europe\n\nhttps://uwpexponent.com/opinions/2025/03/13/who-is-peter-thiel/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies\n\nSpecifically Trump is throwing all these policies up and Palantir analytics software is see what works/fails and why along with what to change next time. The goal maybe isolationism but the path to it through seeing what works and what doesn\u2019t under trump then refining it for Vance. JD Vance\u2019s benefactor for more than 10 years has been Peter Theil (founder and still majority owner of Palantir, explained with shares and link further down) the 2nd biggest defense contractor for the CIA/NSA handling their day to day operations along with several UK intelligence agencies and armed forces this doesn\u2019t even cover the data Palantir received from Greece at the height of Covid (links above) or that Palantir provides support to the IDF for \u201cwar-related missions\u201d (links above), for the US military Elon Musk provides them starshield (military version of starlink).\n\nhttps://washingtonspectator.org/peter-thiel-and-the-american-apocalypse/\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2009/07/13/106479613/a-tech-fix-for-illegal-government-snooping\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125200842406984303\n\nPeter was born in West Germany and grew up in a South African town that still believes in Hitler. Cantor Fitzgerald lost so many people on 9/11. I think they realized isolationism is the key. Cantor\u2019s chairman is our secretary of commerce. He quit cantor only a month ago and now his son is in charge.\n\nThiel directly own roughly 180 million publicly traded shares which 7%. His investment firm Rivendell 7 owns 34 million publicly traded shares. Other Thiel vehicles own 37 million shares. Thiel entities also own 32.5 million supervoting Class B shares in Palantir. Those class b shares carry 10 votes while public ones carry only 1 vote per share. Now here is the kicker for why he still controls Palantir (link below), Thiel has sole investment power over 335,000 class F shares as part of a trust that has 49.99% voting interest in the company.\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-stock-chairman-peter-thiel-b63415c7\n\nLeaked documents showed Palantir's clients as of 2013 included at least twelve groups within the U.S. government, including the CIA, the DHS, the NSA, the FBI, the CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, the Special Operations Command, the United States Military Academy, the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization and Allies\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2015/01/11/leaked-palantir-doc-reveals-uses-specific-functions-and-key-clients/\n\nIt would explain why Trump ordered hectares of federal land be stripped for timber. It makes sense why they would want to drill and mine federal lands/national parks for oil and metals. Making Canada and Mexico into manufacturing zones. Just a couple weeks ago Blackrock (an American company) bought 43 ports in 23 countries that includes 2 of the 4 Panama Canal ports for $23 billion dollars. Those 2 ports, Cristobal and Balboa, one on the Atlantic side and one on the Pacific side are the 2 most important ports at the Panama Canal.\n\nhttps://www.michiganfarmnews.com/critical-panama-canal-ports-of-entry-purchased-by-us-investor-giant-blackrock\n\nAnother big factor in isolation is now controlling the internet which starlink has started. Starlink has partnered with TMobile to provide service bad connection areas. TMobile announced that it would let rival\u2019s AT&T and Verizon customers use starlink as well.\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/networking/t-mobiles-free-starlink-satellite-service-opens-up-to-at-t-and-verizon-customers/\n\nHaving Israel/Gaza/West Bank as sort of an embassy to the world with Peter Theil\u2019s hooks in the UK because about a year and a half ago they got the contract to manage UK\u2019s health system along with all the work Palantir is already doing for their intelligence agencies and army (links below), the UK is our link to the world. Greenland is the buffer zone with Panama Canal as the border to the south. Tariffs in the short term hurt the economy but long term would force manufacturing to increase within our borders.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2024/07/16/jd-vance-and-peter-thiel-what-to-know-about-the-relationship-between-trumps-vp-pick-and-the-billionaire/\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/07/palantir-delivers-first-two-ai-enabled-systems-to-us-army.html\n\nAn era of isolationism is the goal, there is even a section on it in Project 2025 which was written by Cantor Fitzgerald and the heritage foundation.\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/blackrock-panama-canal-deal-ck-hutchison-trump/\n\nhttps://poorandpissed.wordpress.com/2025/03/07/the-shadow-players-behind-project-2025-wall-street-cantor-fitzgerald-the-heritage-foundation-and-the-privatization-of-americas-public-resources/\n\nhttps://www.westword.com/news/opinion-palantir-technologies-puts-colorado-at-center-of-future-of-ai-23822908\n\nhttps://corporatewatch.org/palantir-in-the-uk/\n\nhttps://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/127784/html/\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/business/palantir-nhs-uk-health-contract-thiel.html\n\nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/article/trump-quietly-plans-to-liquidate-public-lands-to-finance-his-sovereign-wealth-fund/\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5RpPTRcz1no",

These folks are objectively victims, or they will be, and yet they went to the polls with a carnival-like glee.  They frick\u2019n dressed up in trash bags and called themselves garbage to show solidarity with Trump.  \n\nThe only reason a deceptive sales pitch like that can work is if the person pitching it is 100% convinced the claims are real.  This is the psychopath zone.  There can\u2019t be a trace of remorse or ethical reflection or people will catch on that it is a trap. \n\nSo did Trump know that tariffs are paid by buyers in the importing country and not sellers in the exporting countries?  It\u2019s not clear.  \n\nWhat is clear is that he doesn\u2019t care.  He has never cared.  Caring is for suckers.  His psyche is entirely wrapped up in winning the deal at hand.  That makes him a useful idiot. Add to that enough wealth and celebrity to go places and he becomes an extraordinarily useful idiot.  The oligarchs, including Putin, noticed and started grooming him for the spokesman role in their vast right-wing conspiracy. \n\nHe\u2019s a tool, an asset, and he\u2019s fine with that.  Being used  is getting him things that he couldn\u2019t get on his own.  People he doesn\u2019t like get hurt on command.  Crowds cheer him. He\u2019s in the White House.  \n\nThe only open question is whether he is a member of the conspiracy (an agent) or just a dupe (an asset).  We\u2019ll probably never know because he doesn\u2019t seem to care.  He\u2019s having fun being cruel and destructive.",

The plan is cooked up by policy insiders, tech billionaires, foreign influence, and think tanks\n2. The plans are drafted by Trump when he hears them.\n\nTrump is insanely simple in his idiocy, and everyone needs to understand he's not bright but dangerous because of this.\n\nSo:\nPolicy insider says, \"The arctic corridor is going to be important because of the melting ice.\" They believe in US soft and strong power for leverage over Canada and making them wholly dependant on the US in exchange for resources or, if lucky, access to oil and lang in the region. It's complex, requires years of negation, and resource trading. \n\nSomeone presents Trump with this plan.\n\nTrump and all of his yes men look at this and go:\n\n\"TOO HARD! MAKE CANADA A STATE! THAT EASIER! IM SMORT! IM GENIUS! Let's DO IT!\"\n\nSame thing with Gaza. Israel wants the Gaza Strip to be basically vacated. Trump, being the savvy and genius he believes himself to be says this:\n\n\"EMPTY BEACHFRONT PROPORTY!? TRUMP GAZA NEED GO HERE! IT WILL BE GREAT! AMAZING! FANTASTIC! I DO IT!\"\n\nYes. There are very brilliant and nefarious people in charge using Trump as a means to just wreck my country. These people see this power grab as a means to put someone smart in after Trump is gone and then we will see the real disaster. \n\nBut this chaos now? It's cause his ego makes him think he's the smartest guy in the room. Russia strokes his ego like no other and he loves that. \n\nSo we are in this mess right now because some think tank said, \"We got to do something about the Arctic corridor\" and Mr. Mush for brains President believed the solution was too hard and making Canada a state is easier.",
