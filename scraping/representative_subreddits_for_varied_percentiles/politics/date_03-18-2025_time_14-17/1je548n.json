                            "body": "When people talk to me about \"Trump's latest actions\" and how he must be so stupid and how is this even happening? I just look at them like they have 10 heads and say \"Trump is a problem yes, but he's not THE problem. THE problem is America. America is rotten at it's core and refuses to admit it, doesn't realize it, or revels in it... or some morbid combination of the three. The majority of America is lazy, racist, uneducated, entitled assholes who have been handed life on a silver platter and feel that the lot that they've been given is unjust, that they deserve more. They feel that they have experienced hardship where little to no hardship exists. They have a burning hatred for the rest of the world, for no reason other than they've been told to do so, and they follow that blind hatred more faithfully than any religion known to the history of man.\" \n\nThere are good Americans yes. But by the actions of that nation over the past decade or so, and especially in the last few months, it has become abundantly clear that the majority are not - and are either proud of the position they are in or side with what is happening simply through inaction. \n\nAbove all else, America is showing itself to be incredibly weak. I believe that weakness has been manufactured and nurtured over a great many decades, and it is finally coming to the point where those who would benefit from that weakness are nearing their reward. A once great nation, despite its flaws, founded on principles of freedom and democracy, is going to tear itself apart in front of our eyes, and the only people who are going to come out on top of that mess are the ones who are already on top today. \n\nEven if the political atmosphere in the US quieted down overnight to something normal, it would be decades before I enter the US - and that is because of it's people, not just its politicians.",

And that's what the 25th Amendment is about: not using poor discretion in your duties, but being incapable of executing your duties.\n\nBesides, if the 25th Amendment were invoked, he could just countermand it. Then his cabinet can counter that, and it gets punted to Congress, who have a Constitutionally defined timeframe to decide what to do; and if by the end of it, they don't have 2/3rds of both Houses (a higher bar than regular impeachment) in favor of the claims of the VP and Cabinet, then Trump would default back to President.",

When you hear the same thing from all media,  you tend to believe it. So when Trump says that the US was doing research to make mice transgender, and then everyone you listen to says the same thing, that is your truth.\n\nThis propaganda is being designed psychologically to capture people - people aren't being told the conclusions, they are being given information and then they \"figure out\" the desired conclusion themselves. This makes the belief harder to shake - and cements in a world view where everything that isn't in their propaganda network is a giant conspiracy.\n\nPutting aside the various flawed election mechanisms, there are *enough* people who have bought into this to capture the government. There are **tons** of people who don't buy into it, but their influence is muted by those flawed election mechanisms. \n\nThere are also a lot of severely fucked-up people living in the US, people who basically have mush for brains, don't think critically, who don't care to learn or be educated. Those people don't vote, but if they did, they would probably vote for Trump because Trump knows how to appeal to them.

But in both cases, the body refused to remove him from office.\n\nWe would never even get that far now.\n\nThis is NOT a parliamentary system. There is no other mechanism, such as a voter recall or a vote of no-confidence, that can remove a President. I think maybe some other westerners misunderstand this when they say, \"I don't understand how he's still in office.\"\n\nIf Congress refuses to fulfill their constitutional duty that they swore to uphold, then it is up to the voters. But if the voters choose to ignore the problem, or do not participate, or if the vote is sabotaged, then there is legally no other option for removal, and only an illegal uprising could accomplish it.\n\nThis is why people are protesting, to create so much pressure on Congress that continuing to refuse to act is untenable.",

Even just on Reddit I regularly see the sentiment \"I'd rather fight for Canada than against it\" expressed specifically. It wouldn't be because they're flocking to our aid, it would just be the catalyst that finally pushes a split in their military between the people who meant their oaths and the people just following orders. Replacing all the top generals isn't anything like as effective in the US as it would be in Russia. The US military is centralized, but not THAT centralized. The moment an actual military attack is ordered on us, it's going to cause people in their military to go, 'hey, what?' and that will be the start of it. Will it be universal? No. Of course not. There will be units that just do whatever. But if you think the entire US military would just go along with it with no pushback whatsoever you're fooling yourself. Soldiers don't fight for their country, they fight for each other, higher ideals don't mean quite so much while bullets are flying all around you. That's not even getting into the fact that if they did invade it would start a guerilla warfare campaign that would make Iraq look like a childrens sandbox. Both our countries would be leveled by it. They _know this._ Anyone who knows literally anything at all about Canada knows this. Just because our military isn't frothing at the mouth doesn't make us incapable. It's a hundred times worse than that because we look and sound exactly like them, know their culture. These insurgents won't be color coded.",

Rather, it\u2019s all a rhetorical exercise of sorts, by which Trump is looking to explain why Russia might feel justified in looking to annex Ukraine.\n\nAnytime Trump makes a statement about how Canada doesn\u2019t work as an independent country and should not be a sovereign state, try and substitute (in his statement) Ukraine for Canada and Russia for the US.  Suddenly, it should be clear that Trump is really just parroting Kremlin talking points about Ukraine again.  Trump is indirectly setting up the rhetorical framework for why the US should support Russia\u2019s claim to Ukraine.\n\nIt\u2019s the long game (provided no doubt by Putin) for when Trump eventually cuts Ukraine loose.",
