It's also why the FBI agents DOGE brought just...went away.

You're ignoring that board members must be confirmed by the Senate. Also that the president fired **11** (let me repeat: **11**!) senate-confirmed board members and left three (repeat: only three!) loyalists to dismantle the organization. I also can't find any info on whether these three were actually confirmed to the board or if they're just \"acting\" as they await Senate confirmation.\n\nAs for independence, they're explicitly set up so they don't have to answer to the executive *or* legislative branches. It's a non-profit dedicated to peace and is **supposed** to be staffed by experts, not cabinet member lackeys. They submit reports to **both** the president and Congress. \"Submitting reports\" does NOT equal \"feel free to force your way inside and interrupt our activities.\" And being independent means they're free to fulfill their mission as they see fit, which is the exact opposite of DOGE actively looking for contracts to cut, projects to end, and \"waste\" to eliminate.",

NYT has more details:\n\n> Department of Government Efficiency officials first tried to gain access to the agency\u2019s headquarters, just off the National Mall, on Friday afternoon, but representatives for the institute turned them away.\n\n> Mr. Musk\u2019s team showed up again around 7 p.m. on Friday, accompanied by two F.B.I. agents, and showed the institute a document signed by the remaining board members that removed the institute\u2019s acting president. But they left after a lawyer for the institute told them it was an independent agency outside the executive branch, Gonzo Gallegos, an institute spokesman, said in a statement on Saturday.\n\n> Over the weekend, the F.B.I. threatened institute employees over the lack of access to the building, Ms. Lin said.\n\n> She also said that Jonathan Hornok, the new chief of the criminal division of the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the District of Columbia, called George Foote, another lawyer for the institute, on Sunday night and made requests on behalf of Mr. Rubio and Mr. Hegseth to gain access to the institute\u2019s \u201cbooks and records.\u201d When the institute resisted, he threatened a criminal investigation, she said. A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n> By Monday afternoon, signs newly posted to the doors of the building warned against trespassing and appeared to have been hastily created. One informed readers that the building was \u201cclosed until furthr notice.\u201d\n\n> Musk representatives arrived on Monday afternoon in a black S.U.V. with government plates and were escorted by what appeared to be private security who arrived in separate vehicles and were dressed in street clothing.\n\n> They tried one entrance, but could not seem to find a way inside and instead circled the building before getting back into the S.U.V.\n\n> After several minutes, two lawyers for the institute emerged from the building and approached the vehicle. What followed was a windowside negotiation: Mr. Musk\u2019s representatives in the car, including a man who identified himself as Mr. Jackson, the State Department official and newly installed agency president, appeared to ask the lawyers to get in.\n\n> \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going to take us,\u201d Ms. Lin said, declining.\n\n> \u201cWe don\u2019t want to sit in here,\u201d added Mr. Foote, the second lawyer for the institute, in a mellow, coaxing voice. \u201cWe can take a walk. We\u2019ll take a walk, come on. It\u2019s a nice day.\u201d\n\n> Behind the car\u2019s tinted windows, that offer appeared to be declined, and negotiations continued as rush hour traffic backed up behind the stalled vehicle and drivers laid on their horns. The parties appeared to agree to hold a meeting over a video call.\n\n> **Mr. Musk\u2019s team did not get into the building until officers from Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department showed up**, Ms. Lin said. **Institute officials had called the police to report that Department of Government Efficiency members were trespassing, she said, but the police instead cleared institute leaders from the building.**\n\n> A police spokesman, Tom Lynch, said that officers were called to the scene on a report of an unlawful entry and said the police left after the people who were seeking unlawful entry had left. He did not say who those people were or provide more information on what happened at the scene aside from the fact that no arrests had been made.\n\n> https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/doge-musk-institute-of-peace.html\n\nit sounds like they did everything right, except that they called the police and expected police to side with, you know, the law.",
