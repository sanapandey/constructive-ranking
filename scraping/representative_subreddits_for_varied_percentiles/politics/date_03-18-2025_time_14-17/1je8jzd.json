It's complete and total lies, told in the most blatantly obvious ways. And yet, they're the most watched network on television.\n\nPlenty of people have very little in the way of critical thinking skills. It's how we ended up with Republicans controlling all three branches of government. It doesn't have to make sense, it's only what you can make people believe. And MAGA has done a good job of making people believe in lies. The lies are the truth now.",

I feel pretty confident that the drop to 47% *is* the \"delulu copium\" drying up.\n\nHere is the difference between 2020 and 2024:\n\nIn 2020 people were tired of Trump because the entire year had been absolute fucking insanity. A pandemic virus, national lockdowns, mass protests, business shutdowns, broad layoffs. People were pissed off, and it didn't feel like Trump took it seriously.\n\nSo the swing vote went against Trump. People hit the \"Change Route\" button.\n\nIn 2024 people were tired of Biden because prices had been insane since the pandemic. He broke his promise to be a 1-term POTUS, and when he did step back from re-election he helped to make sure it was his own VP who came out as the nominee. And both Biden and Harris told people \"Actually you are wrong to be upset, because the economy is great. Please shut up and look at this chart we prepared.\"\n\nSo the swing vote went against Harris. People hit the \"Change Route\" button again.\n\nSo where we are right now? *This* is the point at which all of those people, the ones who plugged their nose and held their breath and prayed that Trump could - by choice or by accident - make things better for them, have come back to earth and said \"Well this sucks.\"",

Were all Germans as evil as Hitler, Himmler, and Goebbels? No, most Germans most likely were not evil  murderers deep down. They were conditioned over time through propaganda, and led to believe by their leadership that the enemy needed to be wiped out. The process was dehumanizing certain groups, and over time escalate to bigger numbers and different groups. It didn\u2019t happen overnight, it was a long process where every day normal people became complicit with genocide, murder, and cruelty.\n\nWe are on dangerous path right now. Trump and his administration are setting in the groundwork. Dehumanizing marginalized groups, immigrants, LGBTQ+. Even Democrats are being dehumanized as a group by claims of them being groomers, and having no morals due to no religious affiliation.\n\nYour MAGA family are completely capable of falling into the same trap as the every day Germans. MAGA supporters refuse to believe reality, facts and science. And are being constantly fed brainwashing propaganda via Fox News. These people are extremely paranoid of \u201cthe enemy\u201d, and will be prone to accept heinous crimes against communities they believe are destroying their country. \n\nMany times Trump has showed these people who he really is. They continue to move the goal posts and continue to support him no matter how gross, corrupt and disgusting he is. These people are supporting a rapist, and a felon. And you think his supporters will stop supporting him if he suddenly kills a group of people that they hate?",

But there is no election. They should be polling the general makeup of the electorate, because anecdotally, we are seeing some regret from people who decided not to vote. Trump's egregious behavior tends to change the makeup of voters (see 2020).",

A huge proportion of the country wants to hurt people they deem as the \"other.\" Many Americans have been struggling for a long time now and coupled with a failure of an education system, the country is easily controlled by directing hatred and anger towards the \"other.\" This includes minorities (hatred of DEI and trans people), public servants (cheering on DOGE), and scientists particularly at this moment those working on vaccine hesitancy and mRNA vaccine research. Once the intelligentsia flees, with MAGA world cheering it on, America is officially fucked and will back slide right into the 18th century. Russia and China will be so happy.",
