Schumer has been in a leadership role within athe party that lost to Donald Trump when he was the most unqualified candidate ever in 2016 and again when he was even more unqualified as a felon last year. His response was \"Trump will screw up\". Its easy for him to say with his healthcare and benefits and ability to pay for things not at risk. Screwing up is screwing regular Americans and the regression it entails may never be gained back. \n\nSchumer keeps running the same play that leads to a fumble over and over and over again.

It's much like when either retired or former republicans speak out about Trump. No one listens unless they are in their political bubbles. \n\nA better headline than using the progressive label is to say \"A Top Democratic Group Says...\". \n\nWe had 90 million sit out this election. Some of them perhaps would listen more if it was not so compartmentalized. Thanks to the years of work by right wing groups thru media, using terms like \"liberal\" or \"progressive\" have become triggers for many. I don't have the answers why... But I know it exists. I told my neighbor I support the views of Bernie Sanders and AOC. He then retorted that I must support communism then. That's a huge problem.",

This article is an interview with the founder of a progressive group about why they think Schumer should resign.

I am not positive trump would reopen the government and it would have given the executive branch that wouldn't have been shut down supreme authority to do as it pleased.  Sure I would have liked more push back then just folding.  Next the democratic party is dead along with the republican party, we need to torch the current two party system and implement a multiparty system, hopefully this will encourage continued discourse to push in that direction.  Next is to primary every centric democrat and push a progressive workers party, figure out a way to combat the republican monopoly of information decemination and hit the streets to protest to force a message to the people.
