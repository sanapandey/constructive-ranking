He wasn't remotely bothered about the violence on Jan 6th.  If anything, he seemed to relish it.\n2. His connections with the likes of Epstein.  You don't maintain connections with someone like that unless you've got a damn good way of shutting people up.\n3. He was a real estate developer in NYC in the 1980s.  (The building trade - particularly in NYC at the time - was pretty well known for connections with organised crime.  How do you make a habit of not paying your contractors in that world and not find yourself with fewer fingers?  Answer:  you're a much bigger bastard than any of 'em).\n4. He released all the people involved in Jan 6th even though he didn't really need to.  In fact, it would have been more sensible not to - why would you want a bunch of loose cannons who are prepared to storm the Capitol wandering around free?  Unless, of course, you think you can find a use for them.\n\nIf I'm right, it's only a matter of time before he finds a way to invent an officially-sanctioned goon squad.  He can't do it now - there's far too many would consider that a step too far - but once he's confident enough he can, he will.",
