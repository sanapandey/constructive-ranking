Congress is pretty heavily influenced by lobbyists on both sides, and they're able to get policies passed with and other branches as well with enough pressure. The only thing they care about is making more money and being able to do so. \n\nTrump is the worst businessman and is plunging our economy and has ruined all confidence in the US monetarily for at least a decade, especially abroad. No one wants to deal with us and won't be eager whenever he's not the one in charge next. \n\nThese are conflicting roles, and I'm wondering how long both sides can coexist. Yes Republicans provide great tax breaks and incentives for billionaires but what happened to Musks net worth and Tesla sales across the board proves that just being close to Trump isn't enough to stay wealthy. He's lost billions of dollars in a couple months, and it only seems to be getting worse. MAGAs can't bail him out when the recession tanks their own spending ability as well.\n\nPolitics aside, I'm very curious to see what happens when Trump keeps hurting the economy and costing all these billionaires so much money. He's creating a problem beyond his own ability to fix and take credit for, and I'm not sure how long he'll be able to stay friends with them. They clearly don't like him for most MAGA reasons and it seems like his deranged choices are even going to turn them against him soon.",
