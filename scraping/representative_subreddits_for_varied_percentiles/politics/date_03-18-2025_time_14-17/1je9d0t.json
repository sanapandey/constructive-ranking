So....once people try that, they are not going back to that industrial solvent you have to kill with Coke.\n\nThis is just false. Many US bourbons and whiskeys are absolutely top shelf and win many international competitions. It's just factually not true to claim that it's all \"industrial solvent\".\n\nThat having been said, despite several Kentucky distilleries making excellent bourbon and rye, I'm sticking to Canadian, Scotch, Irish, and blue state produced products until we actually do something about the orangutan in chief. Good whiskey isn't as important as my values, and besides, Canada, blue states, and Europe (and Japan) make some excellent whisk(e)y anyways.",
