The national security has nothing to do with the environment, it has to do with how to deploy a trillion dollar military into dangerous locations for long and short term missions.  No Admiral is going to deploy his/her ships and subs for 3-6 months without knowing how the ocean will be.  No General is going to send planes out without knowing the forecast.  Literal trillions of dollars on the line and all of it kept safe by knowing the FUCKING CLIMATE AND WEATHER.  \n\nThe only one who benefits from this is Putin.

We might be able to stop or reverse some of the worst offenses, but underneath it all, our administrative state which we spent centuries building, is being torn down, to be replaced by a Bioshock-esque ancap Rapture, the wet dream of the Broligarchs. From ethics, to environmentalism, to social welfare and justice, to political rule of law and due process, to humanitarian projects, to democratic broadcasting, all is being torn down day by day, and we will not see the true effects of the damage until it is too late to reverse.\n\nA dog-eat-dog world only benefits the biggest, most vicious dogs.

I would love to personally get involved locally, but I don't hear anything, I can't find anything on Google either. If you search that one major protest movement or even type it on reddit, it hides the content. You have to know already what to look for. America and subsequently, every media outlet operating here is colluding facts and hiding the goings ons of the protests. My local news station (a memphis station) has only covered them 1-3 times and not before they happen. In terms of in city spread, we could totally spread flyers or have people set up some in a public place to get people registered for the protest/sign petitions, but that would only spread by word of mouth essentially. The protest isn't led. We don't have anyone to gather the roughly 200 million Americans to protest. I live 2 hours from my capital, 3 from the next closest and 13 from the nation's. I do not have the ability to travel to any capital, and I'm assuming others wouldn't be able to either. So we need to have a grassroots movement where people don't get word of mouth but can spread through the masses and quickly inform, which I don't see happening.",
