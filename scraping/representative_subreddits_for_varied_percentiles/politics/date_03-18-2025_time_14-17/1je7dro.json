The US isn\u2019t even a true democracy, it\u2019s a representative democracy, we vote for representatives who the are the sole people who have an actual vote. \n\nThis is what the EC serves as when voting for a president and was designed so that the EC could override the population if they voted for someone insane since they didn\u2019t trust rural uneducated farmers to directly vote for president.\n\nCapitalism is similarly not inherently about inequality, in a true capitalist structure everyone is meant to have equal opportunity to incentivize hard work and productivity and reward that. However, we don\u2019t live in a perfect world or a perfectly free market. We have barriers of entry for every industry and the rich can afford to pay for things to give their kids an advantage. These things are why libertarians are so dumb and why regulations are absolutely necessary for a functioning capitalist society in the real world. It\u2019s been the tearing down of regulations and taxes on the rich that have pushed us to be more unequal, not capitalism itself.",

Like democracy, it was originally intended for the Elites. Regulate it as much as you want, but under Capitalism, the poor are always fighting a class war against the rich.",

Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don\u2019t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don\u2019t want to \u2018go out of your way to make trouble.\u2019 Why not?\u2014Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.\n\n...\n\n\"But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes.\u00a0*That\u2019s*\u00a0the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked\u2014if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in \u201943 had come immediately after the \u2018German Firm\u2019 stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in \u201933. But of course this isn\u2019t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\n\n\"And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying \u2018Jewish swine,\u2019 collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in\u2014your nation, your people\u2014is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.\"\n\n\\- [They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-1945, Milton Mayer](https://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/511928.htm)",

Trump keeps seemingly having Freudian slips about it. And maybe that's just his swiss cheese brain unable to stop firing about \"rigged elections\" like he did for the past 8 years, but again, I'd say equally possible they cheated. \n\nAlso they cheated out in the open by openly suppressing voter turnout and saying out loud that they were trying to do that so that Democrats will lose. And that's without even taking into account the electoral college, voting day bias, and all the other things the GOP has done to stack the deck. \n\nSo either way, they cheated. Doesn't really matter like you said, we could have a perfectly clear video of Trump and Elon on a computer changing votes, and nothing would happen to them. But for the centrists and neoliberals who will be against violence because of the \"duly elected\" part of this Executive branch...not only is that not how the executive branch legally works, but also they weren't duly elected.

It is officially nonpartisan and independent, receiving funding only through a congressional appropriation to prevent outside influence. The institute is governed by a bipartisan board of directors with 15 members, which must include the secretary of defense, the secretary of state, and the president of the National Defense University. The remaining 12 members are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Institute_of_Peace\n\nIt's board members are officers of the US and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThis is the exact same argument that Trump's admin has made against other agencies that are classified as \"independent\". His Administration's argument is that if it was created by Congress and it's board wre Officer's of the US then it isn't independent.\n\nSCOTUS effectively said in Seila V. CFPB the President had unlimited power to fire officers of the US. Humphrey's was the only exception. This means that the agency in question has to \"look\" similar to the FTC in 1935 to be exempt. It's very narrow to the point of practically being useless.\n\nThe new question before the courts is if the President can fire statutorily mandated positions.",

But if Congress does nothing, does it actually matter what umbrella it falls under if the organization still receives funding from the federal government? I guess I'm just confused why this is surprising that DOGE is targeting it if they still receive government funding? Isn't DOGE supposedly looking at all federal spending? \n\nTo be clear, I'm not trying to be devil's advocate and I think what Musk is doing with DOGE is alarming. I know he's corrupt and has zero qualifications to be making an assessment on government spending.

That's just 90% of the leadership of both organizations that will be replaced.  It's a good delaying tactic, though, and they should absolutely do it.  \n\n> And no, something silly like asking them to use a couple of military planes instead of civilian planes to move a few deportees is not going to get dissenters to tip their hand\n\nFacts.  Hopefully, it'll be a slow grind of outward obedience along with stubborn resistance rather than people loudly resigning in protest by the dozen.",

Police and FBI entered Congress funded NGO at request of DOGE?\n\nIf I'm wrong I'll join the criticism here, but it's clear these NGOs are part of a broader scam of government. They're either CIA fronts or vehicles for theft and corruption. I'm expecting there will be incriminating evidence gathered here and it's likely there was already evidence of crime before they decided to enter the building.\n\nFrom mediabiasfactcheck.com rating on newrepublic.com:  \n\nThese media sources are moderately to strongly biased toward liberal causes through story selection and/or political affiliation.
