I am a vendor for the landscape industry so I have tons of contracts and can always get good pricing for high quality work, so we are going to get this done now.\n\nWants that we are going to put on the back burner for now: Tearing out and re configuring the kitchen island, new kitchen counter tops, possible master bath remodel, possible upstairs bathroom refresh, re-doing the living room fireplace wall to add mantle and remove cutout for old style tv, sanding and refinishing hardwood floors (foyer, hallway, kitchen) and new paint for the main level and upstairs common areas (Foyer, family room, dining room, kitchen, living room, powder room , hallways, stairwell)\n\nDepending on how bad things get we may prioritize some of these things and start chipping away at the list if there are deals to be had, but none of the wants are things that we can't live without, or would affect sale value of the house.",
