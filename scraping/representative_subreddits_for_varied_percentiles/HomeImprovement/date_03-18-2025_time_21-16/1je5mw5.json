    "selftext": "I came home when the first long side wall was mostly up and noticed there was no house wrap. When asked why he insisted these 40 year old insulation panels would be plenty. I'm looking at these panels and they're about as haphazard, misshapen, and ratty as you can imagine 40+ year old insulation to be. Multiple inch gaps between panels etc.\n\nSo I literally went to home depot and bought a roll of house wrap. He did use it on two sides of the house. Pretty sure not on the corners. But when I peek into the siding of the garage, no tyvek. Just plywood. Even after I asked. He also didn't do any flashing around the windows. He just literally slapped new siding on top of my house.\n\nSo do I get him to redo the garage? This was done after I asked him to use it. Do I get him to redo anything that doesn't have tyvek? Or redo everything missing tyvek and flashing?\n\nThe thing that gets me is first reaction was \"oh did you want tyvek?\" as if it was my fault, then suggesting time pressure with the extra hired crew. We're in the deep south - Louisiana, tropical rains, lots of humidity. I thought it was standard and required.",
