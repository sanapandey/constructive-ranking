    "selftext": "Hello! I'm in a weird pickle that I have never experienced before. I'm in Central Florida in a home that is below grade.  I'm a fool for buying a house like this but live and learn.  This house floods fairly often and I've been working to come up with a solution to prevent future flooding from occurring. The problem is, every time I have a contractor come out and look, they completely ghost me afterward. \n\nThe first time it happened, the contractor came out, and we had a great appointment.  He explained to me a solution and said he'd get me a quote that night.  I never received a quote, so I called the company and the owner of the company answered and said that he'll reach out to the contractor for an update. Crickets.  The following week I called again and did the same thing. \"I'll call the contractor and let them know to get the quote out to you tonight.  Even if I have to write it myself.\" Once again, no quote.  So I call again the following day and it goes straight to voicemail and continues to go straight to voicemail for a full week.  So then I get suspicious and call from my wife's phone and lo and behold, the owner answers and when I explain who I am, the owner gets frazzled and says he'll call the contractor to see what's going on.  I also asked if he blocked me and if I did something to upset them, I'm sorry. The owner swore he didn't block me and is unsure what's going on.  So I said I'd keep an eye out for a quote.  Unsurprisingly, the quote never arrived. This time I hid my caller ID and called again and the owner answered and said \"Look, it seems like the contractor may not want to work on your project\". Then I said, \"That's fine! I just wish you guys didn't wait this long to tell me, so I wasn't spinning my wheels with you all.\" Businesses have the right to decline services, so I'm not going to argue with them.  I'd rather have a business that wants to work with me. \n\nSo then I moved on to the next company. The guy who came out was awesome! He understood the problems and how to fix them. He offered multiple solutions and said he would write me up a few quotes to see which works best for me financially. They were also going to replace my flooring as well. Because the company was essentially a \"jack of all trades\" he said it would be a few days before they could get the quote for everything out, which was fine. After about a week I called up and asked about installing drywall as well and he said to send him the dimensions and he can see how much that would cost. He also apologized and said he didn't forget about me, he's just waiting for all the quotes to come in so he can send them all in one. So I sent him the dimensions a week ago and went to call for an update to find out that I've been blocked from them as well. \n\nWhat gives?!  All of these appointments have been pleasant and friendly.  I've been very direct with them and each appointment gave me confidence that we can solve this house's problems. Why is everyone blocking me? ",

Despite what some people will tell you, climate change is real and your problems are probably only going to get worse. Insurance companies know this. Serious business people know this.

They have an interest in selling as fast as possible for as much as possible, so they are not neutral. If you fail to disclose or under-disclose, it falls on you. Not the agent. At best, if you have written communication that your agent tells you not to disclose something, then they have some liability.\n\n\nI say all of this having just gone through this process. It was rough and I'm really glad that I disclosed as much as I did and even then it almost wasn't enough. It was costly.\u00a0",
