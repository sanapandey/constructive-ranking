    "selftext": "I recently started painting my cabinets, starting with zinsser cover stain primer. It was good quality but resulted in orange peel texture. I did my best to sand it down to minimize that texture.. but it\u2019s still there. I then decided to go with Sherman Williams Emerald Urethane Enamel. I painted the first coat on and you can still see the orange peel texture from the primer. If anyone has a similar experience, do you think 3 total coats of the enamel paint has a shot at smoothing out the texture? ",
