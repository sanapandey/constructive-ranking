    "selftext": "Hi Reddit. \n\n\nWe paid a deposit ($7k) for $20k of siding work on 12/27/24. \n\n\nWe were assured we would be scheduled for installation by the end of January. \n\nI\u2019ve followed up every other week asking for updates and get one of three: we\u2019re having a production meeting, it\u2019s been ordered but on back order, we will have a date soon. \n\nWell it\u2019s almost been three months and I\u2019m getting the run around by the salesperson.\n\n\nIs this timeline remotely acceptable or normal in today\u2019s climate? I\u2019ve tried to be reasonable but this is getting ridiculous.",
