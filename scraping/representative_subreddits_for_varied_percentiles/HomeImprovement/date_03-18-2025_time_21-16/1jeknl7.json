    "selftext": "I have a 6' wide laundry room with my washer/dryer/utility sink and cabinets above on the one side.  For whatever reason they chose the opposite side of the wall to have the laundry chute exit into a cabinet.  I've hit my head on this cabinet multiple times and I'm trying to eliminate using a cabinet but I'm looking for a creative way to either make it look nice.  Ideally some creative way to open/close it or something else as it's currently a 9\"x9\" square hole up into the ceiling that is basically just ductwork up to the next floor.",
