    "selftext": "We recently bought a home with an open-ish floor plan. We currently have an OTR microwave with a recirculating vent. I find that it isn't that useful, and would love to install a vent that goes outside. However, I am struggling to see where it would go. \n\nThe wall behind the stove is the dining room area, and to the right is the garage. It's a two-story home so our bedroom is above. The only thing I can think of is send it right, out to the garage, then through the garage roof. I am not sure if this is possible, viable, or safe. Does anyone have any advice? Anything would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\nHere is a (very badly drawn) layout of what we have. [https://i.imgur.com/vhOGmNC.png](https://i.imgur.com/vhOGmNC.png)",

An easy way to figure that out is to use a stud finder or remove a light fixture and look/feel through the hole.\n\nDo you have soffit/overhang around the exterior of the house by the garage or dining room above the first level?",

We have decently tall trusses in between our first and second floor, so I'm planning on running the duct parallel with them and out the exterior wall of the house.",
