    "selftext": "The title says it pretty much. \n\nWe want yes's, no's and why's if you are able! \n\nInitial thoughts: I think we should try making them focused topic. There's too much chaos and literally hundreds to thousands of comment chains. \n\nThere's also a big attitude problem. We want to allow everyone to have an opinion in these threads and legitimately have conversations - but the overall toxicity is through the roof. If you didn't get a chance to see the last one - [here's what I mean](https://x.com/rcondiscord/status/1897764626957209775). It may be possible to set up a flair specifically for people who are able to keep their cool and discuss issues. In this case it would only be for the debate threads. This makes it possible for us to devote more time to moderating the thread while worrying less about established posters. **Not for conservative only threads!**\n\nNot all conservatives want to participate. That's fine. If you don't want to use the thread that is different than the thread existing to begin with. If you *also* don't want it to exist - let us know. We run the sub based on all of your feedback. I'll do my best to explain any and all challenges faced.",

            "body": "I like the left to be able to see we are not afraid to debate them, but I also believe that they should cede ground in the neutral subs for this rather than bring their commentary to partisan subs. I hear so many lefties and moderates saying they want good faith discussions, but their less friendly peers either filter in with them or just mess with the voting. If they want good faith discussions, they should be helping clean up the vitriol and extremely biased moderating on purportedly neutral subs rather than flocking to our subs.\n\nEven some of the well meaning lefties and moderates have this condescending tone a lot of times, like we're a zoo exhibit for them to ponder but never take seriously. The hatred I'm more okay with, but the condescension of people who think we are pitifully ignorant is harder to deal with. As nice as they can seem, underneath is a lack of good faith, underneath is a belief we are at best stupid, deceived animals, and at worst, racist monsters. If they didn't ever so sweetly hate us, they would agree that the bias in the neutral subs is a problem and respect us enough to defend the reasonable thing, which is that we should be able to speak there without being trashed and without mods being sent after us in these neutrally titled spaces.\n\nAt least the mean ones are honest.",

And sometimes there are folks that behave that way and have some studies or something that seems like a mic drop in the moment, and then upon looking deeper they were wrong or grossly overstating (either on purpose or unintentionally) the veracity of the evidence they're putting forth. I can't tell you how many times I second guessed myself about an argument thinking the other person had the goods and then come to find out they were using bad research or a faulty statistic that their argument hinged upon.\n\nThe condescension can be the propaganda itself. Listen how confidently so many people were when they told us the covid vaccines worked, even now many do with the same absolute assuredness they had 4 years ago.",

I'll see it all week on wider reddit.\n\nThen, out of the blue(I don't read all /conservative threads) I'll see it as the top voted comment in some topic posted here.\n\n\"Fellow conservative\"?

Seems pretty run of the mill conservative, not even TDS...\n\nI understand having different or nuanced views, I've got a couple views myself that some people would swear aren't conservative.  But even then, it's still nuanced, it's *not* some copy&paste bizarre NPC leftist talking point that gets defended by NPC defensive rationale that looks exactly like bad faith arguing.\n\nAnd of course, it gets voted straight to the top.  Maybe over 1k upvotes, which kind of stands out on this sub, all while vanilla conservative takes are controversial.\n\nHow can anyone tell the difference between a bad actor and a conservative that's, well, a little insane when it comes to that one topic?\n\n______________\n\nAs to the original post this is in reply to.\n\n>if only to see who the 'flaired' conservatives are who being toxic\n\nI'll admit, I get 'toxic' when It seems like someone is arguing in bad faith, ignoring typical conservative rationale as if the whole thing is a foreign concept to them.\n\nI'm maybe a bit quick on the \"fellow conservative\" claim...but, like, if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and argues like a duck....\n\nI wouldn't ban or remove these flairs / users.  Maybe just a report feature along the lines of \"Copy&Paste NPC talking point\"(or whatever terminology) and delete the comment if there's enough of them to trigger a review?  Then maybe a 3-5 strike review, user gets 5 deleted  comments?  Then consider a ban?\n\nI'm not privy to what mod capabilities are(eg user tracking), and you guys have probably thought about all this extensively.  I'm just killing some time really.

I routinely see comments that spin a topic for the left upvoted into the thousands here. Anyone with flair who provides material for the left to upvote in these brigaded threads should be removed. Offer them a chance to earn it back if you must but the fact these comments sit there at the top with no repercussions is why this sub has become controlled opposition. It attracts the left and drives conservatives away, since you are rewarded for posting the left wing anti-conservative spin and punished for posting the actual conservative position.\n\nThe mission statement says this place is to \"discuss political and cultural issues from a distinctly conservative point of view\". That's not at all what the most popular threads here are doing. I think it's pretty funny that the mods are trying to determine how to bring more left wing positions into this sub rather than how to get them out and stop driving conservatives away.\n\nObviously the answer here should be that NO we don't want the open debate threads because the last thing we want to do is attract more of the left here. We should do the opposite and allow less left wing takeover over flaired threads which apparently nothing is seriously done about. TD didn't have this problem because they routinely suspended conservatives who made concern troll posts and the left never had anything there they were interested in upvoting so they mostly stayed away and we could actually discuss things from the conservative point of view.

On that one we 'walled' a bit harder against insults.\n\nI'm thinking perhaps we sit down, drawing board it out, then do one with a tight ruleset that isn't based on any particular philosophy and ideology. If we dedicated several mods to it for a given time period (Hard to do, but possible on occasion) I believe some value is to be had there. \n\nSpecifically - I think when it's not a shit posty conversation or insults we can actually flip quite a few people.

I just see a problem with the citation\u00a0rule as it might be exploited by asking for citations for everything, regardless of how stupid it is. Due to the asymmetry there are many more outsiders than we are here, so we can get bombarded with citation requests but in turn cannot really stop outsiders that much as if someone's comment gets deleted for not providing sources, their place can be taken by hundreds of others. Maybe it can get thinned out enough by giving outsiders a several months long ban (i.e. deporting them from this sub) if they fail to provide a source or alternatively to admit that they didn't have one. It could make us look bad though, if you are that quick with the ban hammer in this open discussion setting.\n\nI definitively see the necessity of having some rule that is intended to steer the discussion towards being factual, so the citation rule may still be the best option.\n\n  \nEdit: I had an idea how one could approach this problem in an additional creative way: You could try to make one of these threads strictly policy focused for experimentation purposes. This would mean that it is forbidden in any first comment (or first two or three comments) that starts a chain to mention any politician by name or even if a policy is left or right wing. You only say what the general (or also very specific and detailed, because why not) idea is and discuss it. This would be a pain to moderate initially, but could take a lot of the emotion out of the discussion about \"trump bad\", \"Elon bad\" etc. \n\n  \nThis could look like:\n\nA: \"I am in favor of X under the conditons Y\"\n\nB: \"but did you consider case Z?\"\n\nA: \"I did indeed not consider case Z\"\n\nB: \"Well, politician A did and this is because he is against it.\"\n\n  \nThis moderation strategy would try to exploit that many of the more unreasonable people have no idea about who stands for which policy and tend to just repeat whatever the news told them. If they cannot say \"Trump stands for bad policy X\" but only \"what do you think about bad policy X\" The discussion will likely quickly reach an agreement that the policy is indeed bad. Then the question why \"you can support this, because Trump\" is only asked afterwards and can more easily be defended with \"you see, Trump does not actually support this \\[source\\]\". Otherwise people are baited into trying to explain why the one asking the question is wrong and trying to defend Trump at once, which often goes poorly.",

Well? Why don't any conservatives want to debate in the open thread?\". It's probably impossible to moderate that kind of avalanche and the good faith questions from people who want thoughtful dialogue will never be surfaced on their own.\n\nI gave it a try by answering this question and offering to dialogue (https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1ipnl42/left_vs_right_battle_royale_open_thread/md344ik/) and it was ok but just not as engaging as I'd hoped. Personally if I'm going to make the time to address a question thoughtfully then I want a really thoughtful dialogue in response as far as why someone thinks the way they do, what kind of supporting data or material they've seen that made them think as they do, etc. I really didn't get out what I put into it. So there's a risk of just wasting time. At the very least I think I got honest answers without venom but just not as deep as I'd hoped.\n\nPicking a specific topic could be good, for my part I'm far more interested in the philosophical or ethical side than the media narrative of the day stuff. I spent chunks of time here during the Russian collusion hoax on leftists coming by apoplectic over the latest media \"bombshell\" and it was just a total waste, I don't think trying to engage on that stuff and get them to think critically about it did any of them any good.",

That's in part how we end up with so many \"fellow conservatives\". There are also other conservative leaning subs that have no flair requirement that prospective members here could be posting in before they are flaired in here.\n\nWhich brings me to my next idea, r/Conservative should consider a spin-off conservative debate sub that doesn't require flairs to lure away the unwanted element from trying to influence this sub so much. It can also be used for recruitment once the debate threads are gone.\n\nQuite a few members have expressed disappointment, and are being driven away, by the unwanted liberal influence here, in addition to the gross abundance of it throughout the rest of Reddit.

It was very overwhelming to try and respond then 50 posts explaining why I am an idiot. I think there were people here in good faith , they just get buried by this mass of nonsense. \n\nThe number of personal DMs I got was really bad. I even had users following me to other subreddits to continue the debate that started here. I\u2019m talking corner of the internet obscure stuff like bonsai potting - all the sudden my comments just get annihilated , called a nazi. And I\u2019m just somewhere talking about pottery.\n\nI don\u2019t know the fix to this, but I still think the idea of the open debate is worthwhile , how to clean it up I do not know",
