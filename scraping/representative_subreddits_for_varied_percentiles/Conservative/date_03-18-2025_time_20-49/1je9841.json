If everyone on that plane is a violent illegal alien, no problem, we\u2019re all good. But how do we know that they are? Some government official you don\u2019t know says \u201ctrust me man\u201d? i personally don\u2019t believe in blind trust of government, but you may feel differently. \n\nThe concern for due process here is that someone who *shouldn\u2019t* be on that plane winds up on it. The **only** way to protect that person, who deserves protection, is to demand that due process be followed for all of them. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m not fussed about the people on the plane, good riddance. I think it is important to take harsh actions against illegal aliens to send a message after being so laughably lax on immigration laws for so long. \n\nBut I am concerned about the number of people who seem to dismiss (or not understand) the importance of due process: it\u2019s how we protect people who *aren\u2019t* guilty, and it is a vital cornerstone of a free society.",

The issue isn\u2019t that these people are being stripped of due process based on citizenship status. These people due to other factors meet the due process burden. \n\nFor instance in a lot of cases the US would bar entry for legal applicants due to criminal background history. If the entry would have been rejected before ever reaching the court system to begin with the US doesn\u2019t have to go through the courts to remove. They just have to prove that this person would be rejected entry for x,y,z to begin with. \n\nMany illegal aliens do not have those prerequisite rejection cues and have judicial due process that others are not afforded. \n\nThose who would have been pre rejected naturally would have been afforded all the due process required by determining that they would not have been allowed entry into the United States due to things like criminal background, disease, mental defect, etc.",

And contrary to the Judges comments the Act does NOT require us to be at a state of war.\n\nThe Judge absolutely was infringing on the authority of the Executive. And the SCOTUS needs to get off its ass and do something to bring the lower courts under control. District judges do not have the authority to act on a national level, and the Constitution places judicial power over the Executive with the SCOTUS, as well as law existing that the Court cannot delegate that authority to lower courts.\n\nThere has been a history of the misuse of power and authority by all the branches and it's time to start cleaning it up. That said, I don't think that impeachment, however viscerally satisfying it might feel, is the appropriate measure.\n\nCourts make mistakes routinely, the Chevron deferral to regulatory agencies is a good example. The power to make law belongs to the Legislative and it should not be placed in an Executive agency, nor should any Executive agency have its own 'Judges'. While a Court can rule the Executive actions not in accordance with the law, it doesn't get to tell the Executive how it has to act, that power belongs to the Legislative who creates the laws and has powers over the Executive through multiple means. What I don't see, over than through Trumps and prior Presidents actions, is an Executive power over the Judicial outside of disregarding illegal orders from Judges exceeding their authority.\n\nAnd we elected Trump to clean things up, this is what that house cleaning looks like.",

They are for *exactly* what you say.  His abuses.  Trump has been complying and even appealing plenty of decisions through process.  \n\nIn this case, though, the President believes the judge stepped outside of judicial authority and squarely into executive powers. \n\nThis isn't the only case where Trump has defied the courts, either.  There was plenty in the USAID case under judge Ali, as well.  We just don't hear much about that.  Mostly, I suspect because Ali kept backing retreating.  I can't remember the other case where the formal response from the DOJ was, \"No.  We aren't answering that.\" \n\nI really wish more people understood what the checks and balances are for the third branch.

Should we do away with that too because it\u2019s inconvenient to give people trials?\n\nThat\u2019s a strawman argument and you know it. You\u2019re not debating in good faith.\n\n>How do you even know if that person is here illegally without giving them due process? Next, how do you know that they\u2019re a gang member and should be deported to a slave labor camp in El Salvador?\n\n>Does it not bother you that we could be sending innocent people to this horrible prison in El Salvador? If they\u2019re a proven gang member that\u2019s different, but innocent people? I object to\n\nHow do you think this process works? You think there\u2019s a modern day Gestapo just stopping people to check their papers? Don\u2019t think DHS and ICE are just scooping up every brown person they see? You think they\u2019re just going door to door hunting down neighbors who might be brown?\n\nNo. There are investigations. Investigations where people are not only afforded the opportunity to prove citizenship, but are required to accurately identify themselves, just like American citizens. Things like traffic stops, criminal investigations, other encounters with law enforcement.",

Do we have to have a court adjudicate whether each person who sneaks across the border is actually a citizen or not? I think the executive branch at least has the authority to immediately remove persons who illegally cross the border without first scheduling a court appearance - I think there is a policy regarding being caught within 100 miles of the border, etc. This is what is happening now as far as I understand, obviously it wasn't the policy under Biden.\n\n If immediate deportation in that circumstance is a valid exercise of executive authority, the argument would be what is really different between someone who crossed illegally 2 hours ago and made it 10 miles inland versus someone who crossed illegally last year and made it to Iowa before getting arrested for gang banging? \n\n It's reasonable to expect ICE/CBP to be willing to look up a person/check their verbally declared identity - a real citizen should be able to provide enough information to validate their citizenship even if they don't have a driver's license on hand. But I think border enforcement would grind to a halt if we applied the logic of \"we must ascertain citizenship only via a court hearing of every person who manages to cross.\"",

The biggest weakness of Trump's approach is that a following president could undo his work with an equal stroke of a pen.  \n\nEven better legislation would if Congress were to regulate the court's jurisdiction in these matters.  It's a possibly subtle difference, but a very important one.  It is also directly within their constitutional authority as one of *their* checks on the judiciary.  \n\nPeople keep forgetting that America is not a kritarchy and that the founders were especially afraid of a government descending into one.
