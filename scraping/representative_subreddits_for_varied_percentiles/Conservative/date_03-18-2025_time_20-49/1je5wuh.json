So we need an actual plan that doesn't involve sticking our heads in the sand or simply banning AI and robots.\n\nI don't know the answer, or what the something specifically is, but we shouldn't be reactionary to technological progress in and of itself, rather we should be looking for ways to capitalize upon it to launch ourselves further ahead.",

Yes, for every 10 low- or mid-tier jobs being swallowed up by automation or AI, there will be 2-3 new and potentially better jobs elsewhere, but there will definitely  be a decline in the total number of jobs, at least during the transition period.\n\nJust think of how past waves of the industrial revolution have reduced the number of workers needed in agriculture, and later in the factories. This technological progress increased our productivity and the overall amount of wealth going around, so there was room for new jobs to emerge in the service sector - but a lot of them were of low quality, and many displaced workers never got back on their feet because their skills had become irrevocably devalued. \n\n\nThe big problem with AI is that its infrastructure and IP is so centralized that chances are high that the bulk of the productivity and wealth gains just end up in the pockets of Big Tech instead of being spread out across the whole economy.",

Like I've said, there is a significant risk that this time around, the innovation will only make the Gates, Bezos, Zuckerbergs and Musks of the world richer while normal workers and consumers see little if any benefit. \n\nWhen the assembly line was introduced, or when offices got digitized, every company reaped the gains, became more productive, and was ultimately able to produce the same amount of stuff for a cheaper price, or better stuff for the same price. Everyone grew richer and society as a whole moved forward.\n\nWith AI, the top tier models require such a prohibitively expensive hardware and expertise that most companies will have no other choice than to rent/subscribe them from the Big Tech companies which monopolize this technology. Companies which are going for their own, localized AI models will always lag behind those who rent server time from Microsoft/Google/Amazon.

JD didn\u2019t touch this- probably because he doesn\u2019t want join Trump in dodging bullets from a podium- but Economists like Seymour Melman laid out the problem. \n\nWhile the military industrial ecosystem doesn\u2019t comprise a large part of American GDP, it disproportionately draws the best and the brightest. One economically cannot make \u201cguns and butter\u201d with the best of its economy- choices must be made. When your country\u2019s educated elite work in military industry, the rest of society gets the leftovers. The result is what we see now- firms queuing up to do business with the subsidy-maximizing FedGov and leaving the civilian market entirely. From the American company\u2019s view it makes sense.If you do business in the U.S., deal with guaranteed revenue from the government. If you\u2019re not getting money from Washington, set up shop elsewhere to cut costs. \n\nAmerica used to be great at making cars. Today you\u2019d only buy a Cadillac if you want a truck or couldn\u2019t afford a Mercedes. Ford literally quit making cars entirely besides the Mustang because they couldn\u2019t compete. \n\nIn every industry, market leaders that used to build products and offer services in America either packed up for Crystal City VA (and pivoted to provide military / federal government services) or moved offshore. Some did both. \n\nThe consequences of our bloated Federal Government go beyond broken streets and fat cat politicians. It also means our civilian economy loses the race to nations who aren\u2019t so corrupt and promote civilian sector economic growth. Washington giving more money from the government to boost \u201cinvestment\u201d is just another subsidy. \n\nWhat needs to happen is cutting the Federal Government back in scope and budget, and slowly dismantling the massive military industrial ecosystem. It won\u2019t be comfortable, but it gets the best and brightest back to the private sector vs the Federal subsidy process we have now.",
