If Putin doesn't, and tries to stop all the ways Ukraine pressures it, then it's past time to apply pressure to Putin. He clearly just wants the pressure off in the areas that humiliate his military, and a full ceasefire or peace aren't his intentions.",

It's still a good plan, as long as we in the meantime strengthen and don't weaken Ukraines and therefore our negotiating position. \n\nAlso there is a lot more pressure that Europe and US could put, both through weapons shipments and expanded dual technology sanctions.  \nOne way could be to keep US aid level at the normal level but in exchange ask EU to contribute more then that, EU has been ramping both spending and production recently so it's quite possible they could achieve this. This way we would obtain more pressure without changing the pressure the US has already been exerting since the start of the war.",

And he should remove his military from Ukraine to finalize peace.\n\nHe retreated to Russian border. Once he did, they refused peace agreement and pushed NATO in Ukraine.\n\nPutin is a huge fool for falling for this trap.\n\nMuch less blood would've spilt if he didn't.\n\nAlso no one can explain to me as of why Russian language is banned for many years now in Ukraine, so-called free and democratic country.\n\nNo one can explain the videos from Donbas from many years ago before war, where residents were killed for holding ceremonies and protesting.\n\nKids were killed. How can you not see that? Even if it's a Nazi children, which they were not, they were Ukrainian/Russian children, that were killed.\n\nYou guys say that Russia killed people in DPR. \n\nThen why, explain me why, did DPR still wanted to join Russia or have autonomy? \n\nI'm just saddened by the amount of hatred people have. \n\nNeither leader is an angel, trust me, not Putin and not Zelensky. But how you can be so blind?\n\nI went to Donbas, I did drive through the border during the war where I met all these people from Ukraine and from DPR, who told horrific stories to me.\n\nYou are saying that it's complete fault of Russia, somehow they're the evil in this world. Do you guys not realize that has zero benefit to be a villain in this current world? \n\nPutin is not a madman, he'd be long dead or gone if he was.\n\nRussia didnt ban Ukrainian language.\n\nThey didnt cut electricity and water to any region because they supported Ukraine. \n\nIt's basic knowledge that neither Crimea, or DPR had access to water or electricity, long before Russia intervened in these regions.\n\nYou can't just blame Russia without knowing why they did what they did. Well, you can and you do. But you shoudn't. \n\nBut whatever. Downvote. Tell me I'm heartless or villain, or Russian bot, Maga bot. Whatever.\n\nI'm still very sad for children in Russia and in Ukraine. They did NOT deserve to die, this war could've been prevented if NATO didnt decide to put missiles so close to Russian border.\n\nJust like Cuba missile crisis, it could been prevented if NATO backed down, like Russia backed down from Cuba.\n\nShow some decency instead of hate. As Turkish person that speaks Russian, I get all kinds of hate for saying I speak Russian. But I never hated or have hate towards any kind of civillian, language or culture.\n\nWhy do you? \n\nIs that how it was during Nazi regime? You hated Jews and their language like this? You banned it? I dont know, but it is not right.\n\nIt's not right to have this much hate, it's not right to hate any language, culture or population. You can hate Putin, he is the person that is supposed to bear the consequences of the hard decisions, you can hate him.",

Ukraine tried that. IN 1991 with the memorandum Budapest, it gave away nukes in exchange for promises from Russia, US, France and UK to guarantee it's sovereignity, it failed miserably in 2014. \n\nIn 2014 Ukraine made the Minsk agreement that should have avoided continuation of Russian invasion. Russia invaded nontheless. \n\nThey can't put the lives of their children in the strategy that failed two times before. \n\nThird no where the hell did you think or see or believe that Russia retreated to it's borders? Not once did it make a single step in retreat that wasn\u00ect forced by Ukrainian forces. \n\nFourth THe DPR didn't want to join Russia, or at least you don't usually send tanks and the military to convince people to join you. \n\nAlso all civilian deaths from crossfire in Donbass were 3400 (amnesty data) Russian invasion we are at least 15k plus and counting. \n\nUkraine also didn't ban Russian language, but it did force Ukrainian as the state language, which kind of happens when they invade you with the pathetic excuse that you are speaking their language. \n\nI don't blame Russia not knowing what they did, i know what they did, i saw proof, evidence and documents both Russian and non that detailed the armies crimes. And no i don' thate Russian language or culture, beautiful literature and decent music, but that's not the problem. The problem is their invasion now. Because with all their good literature they are attempting to destroy another culture and especially threaten the US rule based order.",

Which is why I agree the minerals deal would've been good for Ukraine but I think at this point what would be best for everyone is for the U.S and Russia to come to an agreement for positive future relations that has an incentive structure set up in a way where if 1 benefits the other does and if 1 crosses the other it is more harmful to the 1 in breach of the agreement. Particularly in regards to China. And it seems based on what's reported of the call we have common ground regarding the ME",
