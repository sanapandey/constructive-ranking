They have had fiber in powerlines for the past 10 years by now. Starlink is such an overwhelmingly superior product compared to other satellite providers. that its basically comparing a state of the art oven to a \"baby's first toy toaster.\" So how about this.\n\nImmediately give 2.4 billion to starlink to get all of the rural areas connected as quickly as possible. Then after about 3 months of testing, take the remaining 40 billion and try laying some fiber. If they are unable to connect the areas we want within 3 years, They will be immediately audited. If any funds were misused, take it all back.\n\nEither way we spend 40 billion like you want, but at least this way rural areas can get highspeed internet.",

Im just saying giving 40 billion to service providers that cant or have been unable to provide that service is a waste of money. If the end goal is \"connect as many rural american homes to highspeed internet as quickly and efficiently as possible\" Then Starlink is the no brainer solution because they are asking for 2.4 billion, while the competition is asking for 42 billion.\n\nThis is the exact same thing that happened when spaceX was starting out in the rocket industry. They asked for half the amount of the compitition. But we still payed both. It just so happens that spaceX is really good at doing what they do. So we now use spaceX to send up nearly everything. Yet we also still pay other providers too, They just dont get as many contracts because they are unable to fulfill them. I see this as no different. Give SpaceX the 2.4 billion they say they need to accomplish the goal. If they cant, its like 2% of the total 42 billion dollar budget for all rural america.\n\nAbout that last part. Starlink is up there with being the cheapest service while also being the fastest by a stupid amount. Im talking used to be getting 5mbps download to 150-300mbps download.\n\nALSO ALSO. Each starlink satellite has a lifespan of 5 years. They make improvements to the satellites everytime they send a new batch up. Which means, it would take a MAX of 5 years to upgrade all starlink infrustructure. So not only is it state of the art now, it will always be state of the art by about 5 years of the most current mass produced tech. I dont think the government could do such a thing with millions of miles of fiber. at a lower cost than spaceX already does.",

For the last 15 years they\u2019ve wanted to put a man or woman on the moon again, and they\u2019ve made almost no progress. The plan was 2020 and then 2025 and now it\u2019s in the 2030s. Of course they do so much else as well but they are still slacking in multiple departments. So in terms of efficiency, that department is lacking. They don\u2019t need so many workers to do (using the example of landing somebody on the moon again) something that they managed almost 60 years ago. \n\nThe government needs to cut costs, and it\u2019s not like Elon needs the money, he doesnt have a luxurious lifestyle, and his house is very small as he\u2019s more focused on developing products than self-aggrandisement. If you look at his lifestyle choices you\u2019ll find that he is not a materialistic man and doesn\u2019t need the money to spend on himself. \n\nHis main concerns are developing products that can help the wider community following his ideology, whether you agree with it or not. He of course makes some major mistakes and needs to realise that some departments within the government need to be left secure, as unlike his businesses, decisions made in his position can cause catastrophic backlash (nuclear power plant incident). \n\nHowever America needed someone to cut costs, as some funding was completely unneeded or woke. $8m was spent on transgender mice operations (initially this was denied by the media who thought it was too ridiculous, but they themselves corrected their own mistake). Whether you agree Elon was the man there is no denying there are far more urgent issues than ones such as the one above. \n\nFinally, Elons products generally provide good to the world. Neurolink is an exciting development, especially as someone whose father has an illness which neurolink can directly benefit. Starlink is also extremely valuable and can help millions of people around the world who cannot access the internet, especially in remoter locations like Alaska. It\u2019s also aided drones and anti-airstrike machinery in Ukraine for the entirety of the conflict.\n\n \u2018X\u2019 is another example where there is now true freedom of speech. My feed has as much anti-Elon and anti-Trump as it has pro-Elon and pro-Trump and I can speak for many other people who I know when saying this. Unlike before there is unsuppressed information with community notes to correct inaccuracies. Elons posts themselves often have a community note attached. Under the democrats, Twitter and Facebook were notably paid to keep the Hunter Biden situation put of the main streams in the algorithm. \n\nNow I\u2019m not saying Elon is perfect or right about everything, however it is wholly unfair to suggest he is only in a position of power for personal gain.",

Are you confusing them with appointees?  That's a whole other ballgame and it's always been standard for appointees to leave with their appointers.  Good thing that applies to such a tiny slice of positions as to be statistically irrelevant, and also something anyone at that level would expect and prepare for.\n\nYour attempt to go off on an unrelated reasoning tangent really shows you have no idea what you're talking about and seem to get all of your information from clickbait media (who, unsurprisingly, also have no idea what the fuck they're talking about).  Quit adding to the noise.",
