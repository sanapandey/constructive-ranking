I often found it difficult to find reliable, consolidated information about satellite ground stations during my time there, so I decided to build a database: www.find-gs.com It currently has over 650 ground stations mapped, with locations and key details. It's completely free to use.\n\nI'd love to get your feedback! What other information would be useful to include? Are there any features you'd like to see added?\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/noa7bxh2fbpe1.png?width=1889&format=png&auto=webp&s=406e2eaa617a04ff055c83141c8f988eaa925b13]\n",

Would they be of any use to my satellite mission? It's no real use for me to know that someone else has a station somewhere.\n\nThe site doesn't seem to list the DSN dishes, but does include the EStrack network.",

The main audience right now is pretty broad - anyone working with satellites, planning missions, doing research, or even just learning about the space industry. Think satellite operators, researchers, students, etc.\n\nWe're listing all sorts of ground stations: commercial networks, university stations, government ones (like ESA's ESTRACK, which you noticed!), and even some relevant amateur radio stations. It's meant to be a good starting point for finding potential stations for various mission types (LEO, GEO, Earth observation, comms, etc.). Obviously, you'd still need to contact the operators directly to check specific requirements.\n\nYou're totally right about the DSN dishes - they're not fully in there yet. It's a high priority for the next update, though. Thanks for pointing that out! Appreciate the feedback.",

You're hitting on the key areas: physical security (fences, guards, cameras, etc.), cybersecurity (protocols, encryption, whitelisting), and the fact that a lot of this is driven by specific client requirements and security frameworks.\n\nRight now, Find-gs is primarily focused on providing that initial overview - helping users identify potential ground stations and get basic information. We don't delve into detailed security assessments (and we wouldn't be in a position to certify anything). That level of due diligence always has to happen directly with the ground station operator.\n\nHowever, we are exploring ways to potentially incorporate some basic security-related indicators in the future (e.g., if a station is known to be compliant with certain common standards). But the focus will always be on making it easier to start that research process.\n\nAppreciate the detailed feedback - it's definitely something we're thinking about!",

But things get tricky fast when you need something outside the usual network. I saw this at ESA - we once lost a ground station and finding a replacement (a university station, of all things!) took way longer than it should have. That's a big part of why I built this.\n\nThe space industry's changing. More players, more missions, more need for flexibility. This database is a starting point - a quick way to see what's out there, globally. Backups, research, new startups... it's for all of that.\n\nIt's a mix of stations (government, commercial, university, etc.) for comprehensiveness, but you can actually filter pretty granularly already. Check out the \"Advanced Filtering\" under the search - you can filter by institution name, and other criteria. Still improving it, of course.\n\nAnd yeah, contact info is a work in progress. Thanks for feedback!",

They usually rent services from various operators. Even the constellation operators usually have a mix of their own stations and various service providers. Many countries don't allow foreign owned satcomm infrastructure. \n\n> There's not enough data here to utilize other ground stations, or even to contact who's ground station it is. \n\nThat's kind of what op is asking, what else could be in the database.\n\n> What's the purpose of this database?
