The Astronauts were never stranded. They were never needing to be rescued. \n\nnow if that story brings more attention to this OK, maybe something good comes out of that narrative. But they could\u2019ve left anytime they wanted to, but they chose not to because they\u2019re astronauts and their job actually is in space. Their entire purpose in life is to get to space and do space things in space so maybe staying where the space is was not such a big deal for them. One might think they actually want to be there. \n\nThey were never in any kind of danger and could\u2019ve come home the second somebody said hey you know what I wanna go home. But these people had a mission and they were able to extend that mission. Just think of what more was accomplished than had originally been intended. \n\nStill, it was really great seeing them come out of that capsule. The whole thing was freaking amazing.",

NASA did a bunch of tests over several weeks, but decided it was potentially unsafe for astronauts to return home on. \n\n3. The Starliner spacecraft was returned to earth with nobody on board. \n\n4. Rather than sending up another spacecraft to return home on, NASA asked the 2 astronauts to be part of the next regular 6-month ISS staff rotation (known as Crew 9) which was about to begin. They accepted. \n\n5. Two other astronauts who formed the other half of the usual 4 person mission flew to the ISS, their SpaceX spacecraft docked for the duration of their stay, and the 4 of them commenced their 6-month together.\n\n6. Crew 9's 6-month rotation is now over, and all 4 people of Crew 9 have now returned to earth on the SpaceX capsule.\n\nFor clarity, it's standard procedure that the spacecraft that astronauts use to travel to the ISS remains docked with the ISS for the entire duration of their mission. This means that if the ISS needs to be evacuated in an emergency, they can safely take shelter in the spacecraft and potentially return to Earth if necessary.\n\nIn this case, the 4 members of Crew 9 (including Butch and Suni) had their designated Dragon capsule sitting there for the 6 months their mission lasted. It was available to return home at any time if they needed to.\n\nThese people are professionals who have trained for decades to live and work in space. So they finished their 6-month \"shift\" as scheduled before heading home.",

As part of their decision-making process around what to do about the Boeing Starliner issues, NASA contacted SpaceX about the feasibility of sending a SpaceX flight to bring them home. \n\n2. Elon made an unsolicited offer to NASA for SpaceX to fly a special mission to the ISS to bring them home.\n\nEither way, NASA ultimately decided that a special flight was not required, and that Butch and Suni would remain on the ISS and be a part of Crew 9. \n\nSpaceX already had the NASA contract to operate crewed missions to and from the ISS and it was easy enough to make that work.",

They flew on the first crewed flight test of Boeing Starliner capsule, the mission was to last at minimum 8 days, but they were expecting around 30 since it's a test mission and they want to test as much as possible to fulfill the purpose of the mission as best as they can. For comparison, the crewed test flight of SpaceX Dragon capsule, Demo-2, lasted 63 days, although they were extended from their original plan as well due to shortage of hands on the station to perform tasks NASA needed. \n\nStarliner worked fine aside from some thruster issues that were discovered while approaching the station. NASA, Boeing and the crew of CFT-1 focused on testing, analyzing and mitigating these issues. Extensive tests were performed both in space and on the ground, lots of data was gathered that had to be analyzed to understand what is happening with the thrusters and what are the risks for return, which took some time. These efforts significantly prolonged their mission, then NASA management made a final decision to send the capsule empty back to Earth, despite all the technical teams involved in the project being confident about a safe return after reviewing all data, NASA management took the precautionary route. \n\nStarliner returned safely to Earth in early September, without Butch and Suni, who then became part of the regular station crew rotation, effectively replacing two Crew 9 astronauts that were supposed to fly on the Dragon capsule that docked to the station in late September, nearly 4 months after Butch and Suni arrived. Therefore, they were never stranded because Crew 9 capsule launched with two empty seats that were now used to bring them back home after Crew 10 arrived to relieve their duties. They weren't even stranded before that, as they could've, in case of emergency, returned on Crew 8 capsule that was docked there since March, with the difference of being placed on two modified cargo racks since all Crew 8 seats were full. As one astronaut put it, the only astronauts that are stuck are the two Crew 9 astronauts who got their flight canceled and moved to a later mission, they're stuck on Earth and waiting. This is their job and they love doing it, any one of them would love to spend more time in space if they could.\n\nThe plan to send Butch and Suni back on Crew 9 was announced in August, they were originally planned to return in February since that was the original date of Crew 10 arriving to the station, but that got delayed and changed due to SpaceX having problems with the brand new capsule that was going to fly Crew 10, it got swapped out with an older, used one, which was the faster solution than waiting for the new capsule to be ready.",

Not that I don't hate their guts, what they represent and what they did here with this story, but it's simply my observation that the scale and scope of prolonged media narrative probably did more damage.
