And if the demand is there women will supply and extract the money from you. Don\u2019t mean we rely on you. We can just get it OUT of you. Simple. A fool and his money are soon parted. Men will always spend money on women becoz of their weakness - insatiable need for sex and good looks. So becoz of this crippling weakness, their money will always end up with women. We don\u2019t rely on men for money but we certainly can get it out from you, becoz it\u2019s easy. We know your weakness and we go with it.",

At this point it's been like an hour and she's got quite a bill going and we've been chatting so I kinda ask like \"what's going on here\" and she explained that basically she had this exact challenge. Her brother was part of some tech startup that had made it good and he was now suddenly very well off. So for his birthday he flew his whole family to town, picked them up in a limo, and handed each one an envelope with 10k cash in it and said they had to spend it all by the end of the day or they had to give it back, including any they had spent. So her and her boyfriend booked a trip with a chunk of it, hence coming in for the luggage, and was just looking for stuff to buy that she might use.",

I already have games to play on it, don't care past that.\n- Redo the electrical in my house and replace my stove with a gas stove.\n- Buy the nicest fishing equipment I can find, as well as a high-end cooler, etc.\n- Buy various kitchenware I'd like to have, notably a deep fryer and a sandwich press. \n- Be a whale for a day and clear the WoW ingame shop. Just some fun junk for the game I play the most.\n- Buy a nice bottle of wine, some nice cheese, and chicken from an expensive butcher I like.\n- If I have $4000 or more left somehow, which I'm sure I will, discuss spending with my brother over the food.

Investing involves allocating capital into productive assets like stocks, bonds, or real estate that generate cash flow or appreciate base on fundamentals.
