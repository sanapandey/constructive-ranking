Cool stuck around because its use as a word wasnt meant to be hyperbolic, but to instead describe things of moderate...coolness? Words like rad, lit, gnarly, phat, etc  are words created to describe further on the cooler spectrum (cooler than cool), and because theyre used to be more extreme descriptors of things that are great (cool), they lose fashion rather quickly while words that are more moderate in the meaning tend to stick around. \n\nI'm giving a bastard retelling of the article I read, but I think I got the idea across. I'll try to find the article later",
