But ultimately, my cousin was the one to choose to use the drugs. He knew the risks.\n\nIn this instance, the girl was five or six months pregnant and had been sober (to my knowledge) since she found out she was pregnant. The dealer knew the dope was laced with fetanyl and had overdosed on it two days prior as well as had knowledge of others overdosing on it. He delivered not only the drugs but the needle to her in the middle of the night. He texted her hours later to check in and she didn't respond. She's guilty as fuck and ultimately holds the responsibility but at some point there has to be some sort of culpability on the other end also. \n\nKeep in mind I was not a fan of this girl, not trying to speak ill of the dead. Just overall it was a sad situation and the positive note was just speaking of at least this reckless dealer is unable to continue the cycle. Even though we all know he was just replaced in a blink. Idk either man. Addiction is a hell of a drug.\n\nAnd as for a child with a gun, my other cousin committed suicide a week ago today. I guess he wasn't a child, he was 26 but thats still a child. My other cousin hung himself. I guess im saying if there's a will, they will find a way regardless of where the \"weapon\" came from",

                            "body": ">What happened after you saw her?\n\nWell, I was an eight year old kid, so she obviously didn't make a big deal about it. She looked embarrassed, but quickly covered her boobs with her arms and went back into the bathroom to put a towel on. But that was my Stacey's Mom moment, so to speak. The image of her bare tits was ingrained into my memory forever. To date, I still think about them from time to time. \n\n>What was the first sexual encounter?\n\nOur relationship was a summer fling that began right before I left for uni! At the time, I was recovering from a breakup, and since she had been friends with my mother for years, it was never strange for me to hang out with her. I talked about my relationship troubles, and she shared that things hadn't been great with her husband because he was dealing with an autoimmune condition that left him unable to work. We \"bonded\" over those shared experiences, or at least as much as a teenage boy and a 39 year old woman could bond. \n\nTo make a long story short, we spent a lot of time together (in part because I used to play video games all the time with her son), I ended up admitting my crush on her, and she was surprisingly reciprocal. We screwed like rabbits all summer, and it continued when I came home for winter break. She was surprisingly pent up, so I got to try a lot of things that I wouldn't have experienced otherwise. \n\nI spent the following summer studying abroad, so I didn't get to see her. When I came home for Christmas break, I found out their family had moved out of the neighborhood. The relationship ended there. \n\nThe next time I saw her was a few years later shortly after quarantine ended. She and her family were visiting us, but she acted very natural, so I did the same. We had the chance to speak privately, but it was a pretty standard conversation. \"How have you been?\" \"What have you been up to?\" \"Is everything okay?\" \n\nSince she didn't bring up what we did during *that* summer, I didn't either. Haven't seen much of her since, but my mother stays in touch.",

            "body": "I legitimately think one of my cousins was born/is pure evil. Or at least suffers from some kind of undiagnosed sociopathy or something. I cant tell my family or anyone who knows him because they'll look at me like Im crazy. Except his younger sister.\n\nYou probably wouldnt see it yourselves. My cousin is a charming, good looking and at least on the surface nice guy. Animals like him a lot too. He comes from a fairly healthy home environment and his siblings are good people.\n\nBut Ive known him since he was born. We grew up very close. There is something deeply wrong with him. \n\n1. One of my first memories of him is seeing him pinching his own baby sister and smiling when she cried. And him encouraging me to do the same.\n\n2. My grandad was a farmer who did some dog breeding/training as a side hustle. When we were 6 years old, one of our grandfather's dog had a bunch of puppies. He let all his grandkids play with the puppies for a day. My cousin wandered off with one of these puppies on his own. Later I found him strangling it to death. He claimed it attacked him and he was defending himself. My grandfather reluctantly gave him the benefit of the doubt. Although he wasnt allowed near my grandfathers dogs again.\n\n3. At school he was a bully. Not the type to go beat a kid up himself, but the type who would do a mix of inciting others to do so and looking for ways to humiliate people. If this was a highschool movie, he would be one of the bully's gang that watches in the background (although he never really had any close friends to do that). One time he 'befriended' this guy, got him to confess to some embarrassing stuff in private then told everyone about it. Another time he stole someone's belongings and planted them on someone else, trying to incite them to fight.\n\n4. He has weird relationships with women. I dont think hes physically abusive. But from what Ive seen its all quite borderline/are emotionally abusive. I also know for a fact hes cheated on pretty much every girlfriend hes had. And there was at least one girl in highschool whos nudes he might have leaked too.\n\n5. One of his on and off girlfriends has some mental health issues. I dont really know what her issues are exactly, but shes attempted to commit suicide a few times. One time she called him on the phone at a family gathering threatening to do so. His reaction? He laughed and told her to do it. Only myself and his sister overheard that part. He told everyone that she was just attention seeking and not to worry. Despite the fact that he already knew she had attempted at least once before.\n\n6. There was this guy in college he had a big rivalry with. They were both vying for the same position on the soccer team. I think it started as some kind of prank thing, but it escalated. Eventually the other dude lost his shit and beat my cousin up badly for no apparent reason. Getting expelled in the process. I have since spoken to the other guy, he claims he did this because my cousin spiked him on a night out and implied he sexually assaulted him whilst he was blackout to provoke him. This guy never went to the police though so make of that what you will.\n\n7. If you ignore a lot of the superficial elements of his 'charm', hes actually not a particularly open individual. He lies constantly. Pretty much every conversation with him will have him probing to find out as much about you as possible whilst giving very little about himself away. Often times what little he does tell you about himself are lies and half truths. Hes been that way since we were both children, although hes far more polished now. I even remember asking him when we were both kids 'why do you lie all the time' and his response was 'because its fun'.\n\n8. I dont think he ever really has or had true friends. He has people hes friendly with or socializes with, and he has people who are weirdly devoted/dependent on him. He discards both as and when he needs to or just bored of them.\n\n9. There was this month where he sort of just disappeared. Stopped showing up to work, stopped his messages to his mother, told none of his 'friends' or girlfriends. I think a missing persons report might have been filed. He resurfaced eventually claim he had a new job overseas that he had been interviewing/traveling for. He must have had evidence to prove this because it was all dropped without hassle.\n\nThats just off the top of my head. There is other stuff. But I legitimately believe hes a monster.",

I am currently being tried for suspected psycopathy or sociopathy (ASPD), although I personally think I'm the latter eventhough I show promising signs for both. Yes, quite the cocktail. But I've had a lot of work done on myself and have learned a lot about the way my mind works and how to treat others. Also feel like I'm unlocking new emotions as I progress, which is hard to describe but I have been told I've improved as an individual and have managed to build some good healthy relationships. All that to say, he can change and work with what he has if he is willing.\n\nI can only offer my **uneducated** **opinion**\\*;\\* he checks off almost everything that would lead to me to suspect psycopathy. Since I most likely am a sociopath, the certain differences between him and I make me believe so. Whilst most of my violent behavior stems from impulsivity and lack of empathy, I do still have a conscience, though barely. It is hard for me to relate to the pain of others. Your cousin seems to me to have not just a lack of empathy, but close to none at all. His conscience frames all his actions as just and fair, thus leading him to believe he is always in the right. He is also clearly chasing emotional highs, which shows  a certain sense of apathy towards normal emotions, thus him needing to manually provoke something through causing chaos.\n\nOn another note, I feel an odd hankering to meet this guy and see how he tries to play me. With my combination of disorders, I'd see through his shit from miles away. I'd like for someone to give him a taste of his own medicine and I am waiting for someone to treat me like shit so that I can burn them (I probably should work on that). You might need to keep an eye on him from a distance though, he will soon start seeking more adventurous thrills once the mind games and animal abuse doesn't instill the same high anymore. Don't let yourself get caught in the cross-fire though. I know normal minds tend to have a sense of selflessness, but take my selfish advice and self-preserve whenever possible. As it goes, don't set yourself on fire to warm others.",

His response was \u201cyou know more than you think, you\u2019ll be fine once you get started\u201d. Well, I spent about three hours literally just bullshitting to make the word count requirement, figured I totally failed, and turned it in.  When I got it back with an A, I was honestly confused, and told him I literally just bullshitted the entire thing, there\u2019s no way I deserve that grade.  He was amused that I was arguing about getting a good grade, and simply told me\u2026 the subject was so in depth there was no way I could\u2019ve \u201cjust bullshitted my way through\u201d and that I just wasn\u2019t used to trying that hard until that class.

By halfway, I just wanted it to end. Even as an adolescent, I understood that there was no reversal and however painful and sad the situation was, it would only continue to escalate. But the majority of my aunts and uncles were super religious and were hoping my grandmother could somehow regain some of her memory and at least live out into old age.

While I hold no grudges against my family members, I can\u2019t forget the seeing quite literally seeing a person that would otherwise be deceased still alive by chemical means (I love science and medicine but not when used like this).

We tried to extinguish it but no one had brought anything to capture enough water from the nearby water source and carry it over to douse all the embers and flames. So we left for town.

I drift through each day, technically being on the path to doing something with my life, going through the motions of actually trying, all the while hoping I get hit by a bus or something. The biggest thing in the way of me actually following through on offing myself is the fact that it would seriously hurt the people I love. I can't tell anyone about this because I care too much about the people in my life to burden them with this information when they're already dealing with their own shit.",

If anything, the treatement made me feel like I should feel ashamed of these feelings not because of how it impacts me, but because of the abnormality of it. It screwed me up and yet I've been on anti-depressants and have suicidal thoughts often for the last 10 years. It's rough, man. It's difficult for it to ease up, but there's many methods out there that may benefit you. \n\nFor example - I see living as a jigsaw puzzle. Career moves, relationships, aging, finances - these are all puzzle pieces I'm conceptually putting together to see if they fit. If it doesn't fit, I try something else. And I do this every day in hopes that once I feel I've finished that puzzle, I'm happy enough with the details that I want to keep going. If not, at least I can look back and admire what I've been through and done with what time I did have. That way, my death, by nature or by my own hands, will collectively be better than the depression I've carried for now over half of my life. That's what's pushing me forward - trying to finish the puzzle by finding the pieces instead of trying to get rid of the puzzle for good. \n\nI say all this to really say living day to day is cumbersome and I'm genuinely sorry that you have to deal with these thoughts and this mental weight. It's a very heavy burden to carry around and I hope you find your driving force to keep pushing forward - just ensure that the driving force is close to you as an individual and not as part of a familial or relationship network. Families and relationships change, but having a foundation in yourself will always ensure you're supported. You got this.",

The book builds for years and years and years on the underlying sexual tension between each other until sometime in their 30s they say fuck it and go at it all day and night \u201cuntil they are sick to their stomachs of it\u201d so that they can get it out of their systems completely",

You can treasure good memories that have started to be crowded out with bad memories. You can take the things you enjoyed about the relationship, the love and the laughter and the happiness, and acknowledge that and put it on the shelf in your history and move on.\n\nPeople think that the end of a relationship always has to be this traumatic moment. And it\u2019s possible that your breakup will be hard or harrowing. But that doesn\u2019t mean it has to be and if it is, that\u2019s a temporary situation that will pass. Unless you die beside your partner after decades together, there will one day be the last time you think of every single person you were ever with and they never surface to mind again. You can\u2019t fathom that right now with them being such a part of your life, but it\u2019s true. And it\u2019s okay for you to initiate the process that starts that eventual moment even if they aren\u2019t ready to do so.",

I went to her house to drop off something my mom bought for her. Husband was asking me if I had seen his wife with other men or if I thought she would start dating while he was locked up. After about five minutes of this and her going at it, I told him I had to go to work. He asked me to give his wife the phone . I didn't want her to stop until I was finished so I told him she went to get her kid from school and wasn't there. \nThe following week her and I had sex. The blowjob was the absolute best. Had better sex with the wife (separated) of another guy. She was 28 I was still 18. To this day that is the best sex I have ever had. My wife today is really really good but not like that one.\nOk that's my secret",

I had gone through the state Hunter safety course and went hunting using actual firearms all the time. I knew all about gun safety and never shot anything that I wasn't trying to hunt for food. That was firearms, though. I knew they could kill. That pellet gun, while I never shot any living thing with it, I didn't give it the same respect. \n\nWe lived in a rural area with everyone on their own 10-acre plot of land. Gravel road territory if you will. There was an orange cat that would hit up all the houses on the road. Everyone knew him and liked him. He never stayed very long in one place, just making the rounds. One of the older couples would occasionally take him to the vet, and everyone would feed him. He was beloved. \n\nIn the back of our property, my dad had built me a tree house. There was a bridge over a small dry wash leading up to it. I was goofing off with my pellet gun in the tree house and looked out to see the cat crossing the bridge. I took aim, and with the intention of scaring him away, I shot about half a foot in front of him. The pellet ricocheted up and nailed that cat in the eye. He did a flip and took off like his tail was on fire. \n\nHe was gone for a while. So long that people began asking each other if they had seen him. When he finally did show up, his eye was not only gone but the socket was infected. I felt like shit. I never meant for it to happen, and I didn't know how to fix it. The older couple took him and had him put down because he wouldn't stay anywhere long enough for antibiotics to work. He got really bad quickly. \n\nI took that pellet gun and kept ramming pellets into the chamber without firing it. I effectively blocked the barrel and turned into trash. I still hunt and even went into the Army, so it didn't scare me from guns. It did make me very cautious about firearm safety. It also imprinted on me that even a perfectly placed shot can go wrong.",

She just gave him a dirty look and glanced at me but she never told me he tried to hit on her. She was working at my job during covid, but in his department, so they spent more time together than her and I did during the week.\n\nShe ended up cheating on me at least twice with two other random guys (not at work) *that I know of* so I can't be sure she didn't cheat with my coworker. \n\nAbout two years later, after I divorced my wife, my coworker got married and got his wife a job at our place. \n\nI ended up fucking his wife behind his back and causing his divorce. He suspected it but I guess decided he was wrong because we get along great now. Either that or he did sleep with my ex and rationalized it as fair is fair.",

One day he told me that she had applied to a very prestigious job and she believed she was a shoo-in to be hired. What he didn't know was that the guy in charge of hiring people was a longtime family friend. The next day I called that friend and had a brief conversation with him about this woman. She didn't get the job. Several weeks later I played innocent and asked my boyfriend if she had gotten the job and he was sort of vague but said \"she decided not to accept the job\". \n\nZero regrets here.",

When my parents saw the scrape on our car, they asked both of us about it and I denied knowing anything.

I never told anyone, and got sole use of the car for myself (with the stipulation that I needed to drive her to church every week or anywhere else she wanted to go)\n\nThis happened about 25 years ago and she passed a few years later.",

She was around the same age. We talked for a while, and eventually did long distance dating. She lived in a foster home with her 2 sisters. Her foster dad was abusive towards. At one point, she jumped through the 2nd story window of her house, landing on the glass shards. Surprisingly, she lived. Her older sister kept me up to date. One of the shards pierced her lung (I think it collapsed, but I can't remember. Almost 20 years ago). They also found out during surgery that she had tumors inside her chest cavity. She had to have physical therapy, chemo, sessions with a therapist, the whole shebang. A few months went by and things started to look up for her recovery. \n\nOne night, we were talking on the webcam, when her foster dad called for her. I'm sitting there, waiting for her to come back, when I see her shadow appear rapidly from the hall light of her door way. She slams the door shut and locks it. She has a blade in her hand. I ask her what is going on. Her face is just red, tears down her face, and probably the saddest I have ever seen her. She just looked like she was in agony. She started apologizing profusely and said she loved me. Apologized more. This part I am not certain of, but I think she went to turn off the webcam, but you then see the foster dad kick in the door. I believe she panicked and never meant for me to see this. She slit her own throat, fell against the desk, and then to the floor. \n\nI freaked out, not able to process what I just saw, and also terrified. I just turned off my computer screen, held the power on the computer tower, and went to my room for the rest of the day. Couple days later, I get an email from the older sister, confirming what I saw. She told me that her and her sister were probably going to get taken by child protective services as they recently visited and things were being investigated. I lost contact with her after that. Never knew what officially happened to the foster dad or the sisters after all that\n\nTLDR: Watched my long distance gf kill herself on the webcam trying to escape her abusive foster dad",

One day while my parents were home I was in the back shed where my dad kept a .22 rifle. I loaded it and had the barrel in the my mouth about to pull the trigger. All I could think of is what I was about to put my parents through. I backed out and put the rifle away. Since then I have only told my wife and brother. I will never tell my parents what I almost did. I still struggle with depression but not anywhere near where I was back then",

Next thing you know I felt my acquaintances moms foot rubbing on my crotch! Right beside her sleeping husband. She then grabbed my hand and pulled me into the dark part at the back of the yard and started sucking my dick.
