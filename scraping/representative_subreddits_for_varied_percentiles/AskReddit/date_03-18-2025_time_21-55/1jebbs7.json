So she made a sweet-as-sugar note and they wrote back with a sincere apology and have stayed out of our parking spot ever since.\n\nPeople are dumb, not cruel!\n\nEdit: this was bizarre to me because she usually understands people incredibly well. She should have known what they were thinking and how to remedy it properly. She should have been the one telling me not to write a nasty note. But when it comes to traffic, and I guess parking, she becomes incredbily hostile and it clouds her mind.",
