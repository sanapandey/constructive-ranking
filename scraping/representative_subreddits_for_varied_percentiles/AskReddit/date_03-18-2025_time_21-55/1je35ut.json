When you\u2019re having a bad day, you choose not to unload it all on them just because they\u2019re closest. And when an attractive stranger gives you that look, you don\u2019t start mentally drafting your escape plan\u2014you think about the life you\u2019ve built, the kids who have your partner\u2019s smile, the inside jokes, the memories, the times you\u2019ve held each other up when everything felt like it was falling apart.\n\nLove isn\u2019t perfect, but neither is the other piece of ass that\u2019s smiling at you.\n\nIt\u2019s a choice. A choice to endure the bad times and laugh again in the good ones. A choice to water your own grass instead of wondering how green it looks on the other side. So, no, you don\u2019t just know if you\u2019re still in love. You either focus on the flaws and let it slip away, or you choose\u2014every day\u2014to love them through the good and the bad.",

Like, I love my mom in a way I could only ever love my mom, but it's not every day or every second I'm in her presence that I'm aware of some overwhelming love for my mom.\n\nWith my partner, I love him like I've not loved anyone else. But it's true\u2014we have more of a routine now, so I'm not giddy at the mere idea of spending time with him. Which is a feeling I never liked, anyway. \"Butterflies,\" to me, are just anxiety and self-consciousness.\n\nHe just makes me feel better. Comfortable and comforted. If something upsets me, he's who I go to, and it's always been the right choice. He helps around the house, which is obviously bare minimum, but as someone used to living alone or with useless roommates my entire adult life, it is SUCH a nice change of pace. I feel like I keep saying he's my best friend, but he really is. Even moreso than the women I've known for longer than I've known him, but each of my female best friends are long-distance now due to life circumstance, so that probably also plays into it.\n\nAnyway, if I ever start to think I'm taking him for granted because I don't feel some deep, striking sense of LOVE, I feel for it at the edges, as I call it. As in, where does it end? Are there any holes? Easiest way to describe it is I think of leaving him. And in these invented scenarios I immediately feel SICK to my stomach because why??? Why would I do that??? The idea of hurting him makes me wanna vom and it would be incredibly self-sabotaging as well. So then I'm like, well, phew. There's my deep, striking feeling of total revulsion at the idea of ending this relationship, which ends up showing me the love is still there and just as solid, I've just gone a bit blind to it in the daily drudge and comfort. Like when you eat too much of your favorite snack at once and can't taste it anymore.\n\nThis whole ramble probably doesn't make sense, or might even sound cruel, to the people commenting about how they see their partners and want to jump their bones/get the warm fuzzies every time. But I think there's probably quite a few people in the long term who feel this way.",
