                                    "body": "I was the fool that dated one for 6yrs, married for 8yrs, dealt with the tight lipped responses, the continual \"picking\" for answers and info. Quality of answers depended on quality of question. If I never asked, never heard a peep.\n\nOh.\n\nUntil just recently.\n\nWhen she projected onto me that she felt I was going to divorce her. Moped around and felt sorry for herself. I reassured her, countless times, that I love her. Deeply. And that I will not, ever divorce her, and that there's no issue we can't overcome. I asked what she needed. She told me she didn't feel loved. *Sigh* ok... That's, not answering my question... I ask what she needed -to feel loved- (re asking the question again with that new speck of information). \"Quality time\" was the summary of her 3 sentence answer. Good grief. At least I got something.\n\nShe gets a new job. She is home less (not homeless), less energy, says yes to less things. I get creative. Make baths for her when she leaves work. When she comes back from walking the dog (I offer, she says \"no, it's fine. I like the exercise\", more on that in a minute.) I keep the house clean. Maintained the house. Scheduled new windows to replace the ones she didn't like and had broken seals. Install a mesh safety pool cover. Winterize everything. Clean up garage. Bla blah blah. You know, just all the useless meaningless stuff apparently.\n\n3 months later. We talk. She tells me she's hurt. Out comes all this shit about how hurt she feels. How she's been submissive. How she's had to manage and change how she behaves around me. How she's had to manage my moods, and wasn't sure how I was going to react to some things. How our finances are done. How she's kept all this shit in because she was afraid of me. On, and on, and on.\n\nHoly fuck, mate. Uhhh what? You sound pretty fucking miserable. It's pretty alarming and hurtful because just 15 minutes ago, I knew we had to work on things, but holy shit I didn't know that this what you were feeling while we laughed, and snuggled, and kisses each other good bye, and when I greeted you home every day by opening the door and having our dog sit in the doorway and then letting her run out to you when you get out of the car! I ask her about her day, if it was rough, I ask if there's anything I can do... Things seemed like they were on the right track! I don't know how many times, every time she opened up about something, that I said: \"I didn't realize.\" And \"I had no idea.\" And \"I wish I knew sooner.\" I reaffirm my commitment to her. \n\n... then she says she wants a separation.\n\n... and says she saw no change in the 3 months.\n\nI find out later, not through her, that she liked walking the dog, TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE/AWAY FROM ME. ... WHAT!? We were laughing. We are snuggling on the couch. She's falling asleep beside me while I game on mute and I put on her favorite music. It all felt like quality time to me, the most it could be with her lower energy and later working hours, and also the many conferences and traveling for work. So, really, there was maybe 1 whole week of total time that there might have been an opportunity to do something \"impressive\" enough for her to consider it \"real change\". But was she even looking for it? Was it even quality time that she needed to feel loved!? Did she just give me some bullshit tight-lipped half assed answer again? Why did she happily say she likes walking the dog for exercise before, but is now telling everyone she used that as a way to get away from me? FFS! \n\nAnyways. She prefers feeling sorry for herself. Is finding all the validation she wants now by complaining to all her friends about me and how miserable her whole life is. I asked her what she accepts responsibility for as to why we are at this point, and she accepted responsibility for assuming and having the courage to bring up that she felt I was going to divorce her, and waiting all summer and seeing no change. That's it. That's her responsibility. Which, as I stated earlier, was projection. Why? Because her reasoning for why she felt like that, all sounded a lot like things that would make HER feel like divorcing ME. Weird. And as soon as I reassured her, the question of me divorcing her suddnt wasn't the issue. It was something else entirely different. She didn't feel understood. Or seen. Hard to feel that way when, you know, don't open up and keep yourself shuttered because of all this crazy shit you designed to keep yourself away from me. But no matter. Accepting responsibility for that would invalidate your current feelings of hurt and pain and emotional detachment.\n\nI had depression. I told her about it. I admitted to her all of my faults and insecurities. I got a therapist. Now, I'm looking back, and I see why I had depression. I see why I was insecure. I've been left guessing and mind reading, and struggling to get her to open up and be direct and honest and open with me. I thought I wasn't doing anything right. I've been in this continuous state of confusion and doubt this whole time. Trying to slowly piece together this jigsaw puzzle where every piece had one nub and 3 slots. It was impossible. I've been at a disadvantage this entire time because that's where she kept me. And now I'm blamed for it all. And she is out there loving her new freedom and \"stretching her wings\". Fuck marriage.",

I told her my problems to HOPE that there's a solution, because this was going to be a huge problem one day. I just didn't want my problems to hurt her.\n\n  \nGuess what? Couple of days later, it did. Last night when she was sick, I wanted to talk to her because I really liked talking to her and this bothered her. (Yeah, I know I take accountability for that especially when she was really sick and couldn't talk.)  Instead of telling me I bothered her or annoyed her, she only told her friends. On the next day she already lost feelings and interest but wanted to be friends. This INCREDIBLY hurts me a lot as I felt BETRAYED. Couple of days after that I stopped being friends for the sake of my mental health and that I realized I'm better off without her. She likes another guy who's a year older at highschool. (:P)\n\n  \nI learned, reflected, and well obviously cried but I'm doing much better now, I hate seeing her. Especially when she talks about her new crush and how much she likes him literally right next to me in class. Fricking annoying.\n\n  \nI just wonder why? Communication is so important especially when I'm a loyal guy and I loved her so much, no intentions of hurting her or anything bad at all. It was my first time, and I knew problems and mistakes would bound to happen that's just part of life. And being betrayed like this killed me. 2 weeks I was in deep state of pain.",

From my own subjective experience, THAT is what I meant by accommodatimg.  That, for me, was a regular part of a resentment/worry engine that ground all my best efforts to nothing for a couple decades.  I'm still in the process of getting free of it, I'm grateful for all I've got to learn, also still kind of stung - in that end-of-relationship kind of way - by how impersonal it ultimately was... Hope I'm not oversharing, I just wouldn't want to present myself as unbiased.  I recommend you do a search on youtube for \"covert narcissist\" and see if any of the that resonates.  Not because any of us are so easy to label, but because, if you're struggling in this dynamic, a little bit of awareness goes a long way.",

He barely graduated high school and she tried to show him the ropes when it came to college, but he never once listened to her. He had such a huge ego and was so narcissistic that he thought that he didn't need to do anything and good things would just come to him automatically, even though he flunked out of both art school and community college (yet he tells people that the schools kicked him out because he was \"too smart\" for their standards) and is barely literate or past a 2nd grade level when it comes to his math knowledge. And the craziest part of this all is that my friend and everyone else who knew him tried convincing him to go to therapy because he clearly shows signs of some sort of mental troubles, but he said no because he comes from a super religious family who's obsessed with meditation and thinks that meditating enough can cure cancer and mental illness, so he's not gonna get the help he needs. It's been 2 years since she cut him off, but he still accuses my friend and everyone else he used to know of ruining his life and thinks that he'll one day make more money and be more successful than all of us and finally be able to enact revenge, but he's also approaching his mid 20's and he has no job, no money to his name, and spends his days sleeping, smoking weed, or jerking off to porn in his parents' basement. I recently tried to convince him to maybe just get a job in the entertainment industry because he's super into movies and pop culture and wants to become a famous director/producer/screenwriter, but then he immediately got mad at me the second I suggested he get a job and cussed me out. You can't help people who can't help themselves, some people are just born to be fuckups and you can't do anything about it, and that guy's just gonna keep on screwing up and going down further and further while blaming everyone around him.",

Finally, I grew tired of listening to complaining without seeing any action toward resolution. I took a chance telling her the truth, knowing that I was putting our friendship on the line. I told her in his loving terms as I could that I was happy to spend time with her and so on, and I cared about her very much, but I found it too frustrating to listen to concerns about which she was not willing to take any action to her credit, she took this feedback and actually ran with it making huge changes finally, in our friendship did not dissolve.",

Many years after the divorce, he started to grow as a person, and sent me a really nice email stating that he was sorry (for specific things, not just a general apology) and that he wished me all the best in my life. \n\nIt was a welcome surprise. He wasn't trying to get back with me, and he made it clear he wasn't angling for any sort of reply from me. \n\nThis guy NEVER apologized when we were dating/married. We had MANY arguments about why apologies were needed but he just didn't want to even try. \n\nI found it to be a very nice gesture and while we certainly aren't still friends or anything, his email gave me the same feeling I get when I read a nice book and return it to the library. Closure can be done respectfully and bring healing to both parties.",

I\u2019m proud to say that negative experience taught me to be a better husband. \n\nOne of my exes (my biggest drinking partner) was notorious for not taking any accountability and lying her way through the process. Last year she died after yet another relapse. I hadn\u2019t seen or spoken to her in 15 years (and the last time I did she tried to pull some awful fraud with me in the center of it that I wrote about previously), so I wasn\u2019t really invested in the outcome of her life.

An addict can be functional in terms of keeping a job, paying their bills, etc. Their addiction will eventually have negative consequences.\n\nA person who takes medication and lives a normal and healthy life is not an addict in the most popular use of the term.

My dad has been a \u2018functional\u2019 alcoholic my whole life and is very much like your friend when he drinks. My mom spiraled into a case of crippling alcoholism around her 40s and she\u2019s more of a sad, salty blackout drunk. So that\u2019s a small sample alone of two people with polar opposite reactions to booze lol. I guess it really just depends on your brain chemistry\u2019s natural disposition.",

Then again, could be a random occurrence. \n\nIt just hits. No warning, no actual trigger. I blackout and wake up in my bed in absolute fear. What have I done this time? Who was involved? What if I did something extra extra stupid? \n\nI've accepted the simple fact that overconsumption is a big risk and no longer possible. Sure, I could go alcohol free but I had to be realistic and not too strict on myself. I like drinking beer, I like drinking with people and I **can** be a fun person to be around drunk. Setting a boundary like that without fully committing is just preparing to cross it. I just need to manage the risk better. End solution seems to be Alcodroid (app on my phone) and using it when I feel I could be at risk. When it shows me that I'm nearing the red, I start drinking water.\n\nI still feel a lot of shame around this to be honest. There is simply no reason to do the things I've done drunk but I also need to handle them. I talked to all the people involved and made amends. Now the name of the game is prevention.",

Perhaps that is not necessarily the case and it's more of a \"vibe\" thing? If someone is angry as hell when they're drunk, the truth is they are probably bitter and angry all the time and just know how to hide it when they're sober.",

But it is more convenient just to eat plain ass chicken and rice every day",

Much less, but still more than the US.\n\n[Sodium intake Japan](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1003381/japan-daily-salt-intake-population/) Around 4000mg.\n\n[Sodium intake South Korea](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352618115000475) Around 4300mg. \n\n[Heart disease mortality rates by country](https://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/coronary-heart-disease/by-country/) Despite having some of the highest sodium intakes in the world, South Korea has the lowest heart disease mortality rate on the planet and Japan has the third lowest. [Heart disease rates by country](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/heart-disease-rates-by-country) In terms of age-standardized rates of heart disease (disease itself, not death from disease), Japan is fourth lowest and SK is sixth lowest.\n\n[Sodium-potassium ratio](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/sodium/potassium-ratio-linked-cardiovascular-disease-risk) The ratio of sodium to potassium is a much better predictor of hypertension and heart disease risk than either one alone. This is because sodium and potassium displace each other in your cells. An imbalance in either direction can cause heart disease \u2014 but most people are currently imbalanced towards sodium. The other part of that 2300mg sodium recommendation is a 4700mg potassium recommendation, and the average American only consumes 2600mg. So, if the ratio is the most important thing, logically, our current 3600mg sodium intake would be fine if we were also consuming 7300mg potassium *and* drinking enough water to expel any excess.\n\nThe water and exercise bits are pretty straightforward. Sodium and potassium are both carried through water. Exercising makes you sweat, and that sweat contains sodium and potassium that is now leaving your body. That and pissing are the two main ways your body secretes sodium and potassium. So, the more you drink water, piss, and sweat, the more you secrete sodium and potassium, the more you need to intake of each. This assumes your kidneys are healthy.\n\n[Salt hunger](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4433288/) If you are deficient in sodium, you will feel hungry. Specifically, you will crave salty foods. Just logically again, if you are intentionally avoiding salty foods to maintain the 2300mg limit, you will either end up overeating other foods due to those cravings, or you will simply be extremely uncomfortable for no reason.\n\nAnd yeah, there isn\u2019t really any straightforward recommendation for athletes. It would be impossible to make one. [This](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8955583/) study digs into it, but it\u2019s pretty complicated. It varies wildly by the type of exercise and person. If you\u2019re doing an endurance sport that makes you sweat a lot (like running), the average person will sweat about a liter per hour and that liter of sweat will contain about a gram of sodium. So, logically, this average person would need to take in an extra gram of sodium per hour of exercise. \n\nBut both the amount of sweat and the sodium concentration are very different from person to person. Not to mention the effects of temperature, experience in that exercise, amount of effort, etc. \n\nThe reality of nutrition is that if you\u2019re paying attention to your diet, eating things that have a decent nutritional value, getting regular exercise, and listening to what your body is telling you, you are probably gonna be pretty healthy. Unless you have a disease or your blood work/bp readings/whatever are off, it really doesn\u2019t need to be overcomplicated with all of these rules and limits. \n\nYou ever notice how food tastes saltier when you\u2019re dehydrated? Just listen to shit like that. If it tastes very salty, it probably has more salt than you need in that moment. If the same exact food tastes less salty the next day, you probably need the salt. And yeah, for the average person, listening to their body would likely lead to them eating around 2000mg of sodium per day. But certainly not for everyone, and it\u2019s not something that\u2019s worth obsessing over for the vast majority of people.",

Going no salt would make someone look \u201cflat\u201d and actually not as lean because the muscles wouldn\u2019t fill out and press tightly against the skin. It\u2019s equal parts science and art to get it right.",

And spices are another step; cooking is all about doing all the steps in the right order. Precisely weighing becomes the most important step, and when you're skipping steps the spices are a step you can skip and there are no actual consequences other than life being slightly less nice. (But also again sometimes over-spicing food has negative consequences.)",

He had clients who were elderly and needed muscle strength exercises, people who survived strokes and car accidents, people who had had gastric bypass and were being introduced to safe fitness/gym rules for the first time, pregnant women who wanted to work out safely. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe never ever \"one size fits all-ed\" his clients, and he never discussed his shakes or Tupperware of lunch that was specific to his bodybuilding, because he wanted to set the example that everyone had different health and workout goals and food needs. After seeing clients he'd be in the gym doing his hardcore weight programs, but he NEVER looked down on anyone doing their \"own thing\", even if it was 15 min on an exercise bike. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most encouraging fitness-centric people I have ever met, who truly loved making a difference and helping people towards their goals.",

But you can imagine your current strategy as playing a game and never leaving the early area, because you can control the experience, you don\u2019t need to invest time in getting better at the game, etc. you have an issue where you haven\u2019t developed or practice certain skills, because feeling close to others is something that you can practice and is a kind of skill, and you\u2019ve decided that you can never learn those skills, and so have shut off part of the game to yourself. Like if you were playing Elden Ring and just never tried to challenge the first major boss but cruised around forever in limgrave.\n\nAn alternative way of thinking about it that might connect more is how some therapist will explain it, that your brain is a learning system design to keep you alive and healthy, but that it can learn bad habits and then will do it\u2019s best to persuade you that those bad habits are good. So the idea that you are better off without anyone, and better off without learning how to live with people is something that your brain is very certain of because of trauma that has taught it that this is the only way to survive. But it\u2019s important to remember that when you feel very certain that this has to be the way things are, that\u2019s because your brain doesn\u2019t want you trying other tactics, because it\u2019s convinced that the world is a particular way (which it isn\u2019t) and therefore thinks that your approach is the only possible way to survive in the world. That\u2019s why you feel that these characteristics are indelible in you, or are too expensive to change, because your brain is doing its best to persuade you that that is true, including by sabotaging attempts to do different things, All because it is afraid. But you can teach it to think differently, and it is worthwhile, just as if you have a muscle that you have never trained, and you\u2019re always afraid of injuring it, it is possible to start training it and lose that fear of injury.",

Emotional depth and vulnerability don't exist when my need is to \"make sure your needs are met, and the kid's needs are met; then I'll have time to figure out my needs and meet them.\"  I don't know what self-care looks like other than feeling incredibly self-centered and selfish.  Making plans and expressing wants and needs feels presumptive, placing me above others and ignoring others' perspectives, wants, and desires.  I don't ever want to prioritize me over others--not to be a martyr, but because they'll get immense joy and satisfaction from having their needs met, and I haven't had a need met (or identified) in so long it wouldn't be as meaningful for me.  I've been a relentless \"go with the flow\" guy for so long.\n\nRegardless. In therapy rn.  trying to figure out needs, wants, and boundaries.  Good luck to others struggling like me.",

I was so confused when he was really upset when he wanted to end things with me, he even cried and told me I was perfect and he\u2019ll never find someone as special as me, but because he was abroad for several more months after he left for his master\u2019s, he couldn\u2019t handle it, and that he wanted to revisit a relationship with me one day (but have the freedom to date other people in the meantime). \n\nI said hell no. He had already put me through a hellish 3+ years long \u201csituationship\u201d, from not wanting to commit despite having strong feelings for me, flirting with me time and time again when I tried setting boundaries to just be friends cause I knew he couldn\u2019t handle a relationship with me, and having weird things with a few of his girl friends and exes, before I basically gave him an ultimatum that we either date officially or I\u2019m done. I was expecting him to end things then, but to my surprise he agreed because he couldn\u2019t stand to lose me. I figured I\u2019d give it a chance anyway since it\u2019s what I thought I wanted for so long, but I didn\u2019t initially consider is how horrible it feels to have a relationship predicated on an ultimatum, and so it didn\u2019t last long. \n\nI\u2019ve been much more at peace and happier since things ended. At first we were only going to take a month or so break from talking, but I keep extending it because I don\u2019t want to go back to how I felt before. I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s doing and I don\u2019t know if I ever want to know. I\u2019m still so angry. I\u2019m now part of his long list of exes that want nothing to do with him out of resentment, seriously he\u2019s 4 for 4 there. He was supposedly going to go back to therapy, so I hope he can finally grow properly, and I really hope he\u2019s staying single for a long while so he doesn\u2019t continue to fill the void in his heart with unsuspecting victims and leave a trail of heartbreak everywhere he goes, but I don\u2019t have much faith in him. \n\nI do miss his friendship though. He really helped me realize what I value in a friend. Maybe I\u2019ll forgive him once I\u2019ve moved on and we can revisit being friendly one day.",

I don\u2019t feel that us ^((assuming)) guys get nearly enough coaching through these situations and it\u2019s not emphasized how drastically people like this will fuck your life up.\n\nYou have to make sure to be confrontational and real with yourself mentally. For me avoidance kind of became a learned behavior that wreaked havoc on my personal life too. Don\u2019t let yourself push anything off \u2014 try to deal with everything you face and allow yourself to be vulnerable. That is a must in relationships. There is a constant burden of entrusting someone with that who will be fully equipped to use it as a tool against you.\n\nA lot of people will see vulnerability and exploit it, even subconsciously. You need a strong sense of self to be the type of person who can recognize a crossed boundary and say \u201cyou\u2019re not going to do that with me, I can leave.\u201d Manipulative people tend to work with what you give them, and worm their way into your head little by little. They\u2019re looking for someone who\u2019s going to laugh it off, who\u2019ll ask if they can leave. You can think of it kind of like the process of flirting, where there\u2019s a mutual confirmation of advances to establish or do away with boundaries, but instead, manipulators are seeking one sided confirmations that you will allow and put up with advances to see how well you pose like a mannequin.\n\n---\n\nAnyway \u00a0hey, I was where you\u2019re at a few years ago. Ultimately hit a rock bottom ish. Soon after, I was about as undatable as it gets. Chaos ensued, big time. Messes were made, lost a lot of myself. I really feel that my personality changed a lot, not necessarily in a positive way. Ultimately not much has substantially improved, and I\u2019m still working my way back to trying to be healthy and normal, years later. I basically have no life direction, all kinds of issues.\n\nBut in the midst of it all \u2014 undatable, depressed, minimal prospects, just losing across the board \u2014 I found an ***incredibly*** intelligent and attractive person, who shows me every day just how worthwhile the shitshow can be, sometimes when you don\u2019t expect it. It\u2019s not guaranteed, sure. Dating her has changed my perspective. I really wanted things to go back to the way they were before the breakup. Now, I wish I never met that person and that I had understood I was dating a black hole.\u00a0\n\nEnough ranting I guess. Keep yourself moving. Where I come from, there\u2019s no word for winter, just call it a camus summer. Maybe be open to the possibility, or appreciate and make note of the fleeting phenomenon when it occurs, that amidst the chaos, everything just kinda resolves itself sometimes, even if for only brief moments. That\u2019s out there for you too. Very little is permanent. I hope you wake up someday and feel whole as a person, unconditionally.",

We had an apartment (rented) and I didn't got important things for me because I would be back soon.

Went through all stages of grief and it's been a while since he means NOTHING. \n\nInstead of falling into my old pattern of blaming myself thinking I was not good enough, I realised he had a serious problem with attachment and emotional responsibility. I had nothing to deal with it. I left the burden go because it was not mine to carry. \n\nThat's how you cope: you can be the most wonderful person in the whole person but to an avoidant you are not a person, you are means to fill their necessity. When you stop filling whatever is that they need (reassurance, love, sex), they will move on to the next thing because they have a void inside they can never fulfil. Most of avoidant people aren't self-aware. They do nothing to fix it. They need therapy and to stay away from emotionally healthy and available people.",

Everything was great.

Every time I brought it up, she\u2019d just say it was \u201cstress,\u201d and I took her word for it. Meanwhile, she was slowly pulling away, and I didn\u2019t even realize it. It sucks.\n\nSeeing this thread makes me feel less crazy, though. I didn\u2019t make the change either, but it\u2019s good to know what I felt was real.

Then bam, they surprise you with heartbreak. One thing to realize about avoidants is that it's not that they don't like you or something. It's often quite the opposite, actually. When they realize that their feelings for their partner are getting serious, their subconscious fear of that level of intimacy basically leads them to push away and break it off with their partner. They may even intentionally use trivial things that annoy them as their reasoning (you breathe too loudly, etc.). They want distance to cool down. If they really liked you, more often than not they'll be back at one point or another--even if as \"just friends\"--especially if you're the one to break it off with them.\nHowever, unless they've worked on themselves extensively through therapy, take responsibility for their role in their failed relationships, and learn from the consequences of their actions, you can expect them to repeat the cycle.\n\nI used to be secure in my relationships. Then I dated an avoidant (I didn't know at the time). Truly fell in love for the first time. Then got discarded literally out of nowhere. Stayed friends at their insistence and due to my own inability to let go because I was in love. Went through several threats of being discarded and some periods where they \"needed space\". Then felt like we were the closest we'd ever been. Got discarded again... Out of nowhere. Needless to say, the rollercoaster had turned me from being secure to being an anxious mess in relationships.\n\nIf anyone who reads this feels like this is describing their own relationship struggles, I urge you to take a closer look and to seek out therapy (individual or couples). Falling for an avoidant can absolutely be traumatizing. Calling your partner out on this will just lead to them pushing you away. They're hurting too, but instead of facing their emotional problems and personal fears head-on, they seek the comfort of distance (hence the term avoidant) regardless of how it affects their partner and usually paint themselves as the victim. Your best bet is to go full-on no-contact with them. Either way, you have to learn to put yourself first again, and that's where I'm at.",

I would also like to let you know you're not alone and I'm rooting for you as you continue on your difficult healing journey.\u00a0 Reading your post, it's obvious to me that you're doing the work to \"get rich\"...\n\n\nI'm someone who learned about what avoidant attachment was only after I was hurt by (and angry about) the actions of it and left with confusion around the why.\u00a0\n\n\nI had to learn for my own healing sake because I needed to know if this person was acting from their heart or their conscious mind. I've had conversations with a few other people who are self proclaimed avoidants who showed me it was neither of those things - it's all reactions ordered from the subconscious and carried out through the nervous system.\n\n\nTo a logical, non avoidant person, it makes no sense that they would have that approach to intimacy or treat someone who shows them love in the ways they do. Because of that, it's easy to be angry and take an avoidant's actions personally. It's easy to label them heartless narcissists.\u00a0 It's really hard to have compassion for someone that's hurt you.\n\n\nWhile there are avoidants like youself - aware, empathetic, and courageous enough to heal - there are in fact more that are narcissistic and unwilling to heal.\n\n\nThe avoidants like you deserve to have that compassion - you're essentially dealing with some kind of hybrid of addiction and PTSD and that is TOUGH.\u00a0 I hope that you give yourself some compassion and that your future relationships offer you the same.\n\n\nWhat sucks is that the other avoidants are more prevalent, and they are the ones that give the avoidants the reputation they have.\u00a0 Those are the ones that should be ...avoided\ud83d\ude43.\u00a0\n\n\nMy post was about them because that was/is my personal experience with an avoidant.\u00a0",

A lot of avoidants are wonderful, sweet, kind people who are contributing a lot to society and are doing their best.\n\nAnd avoidance is on a spectrum like anything else - avoidants probably make up a third of the adult population.  Some of them are narcissists, some of them are autistic, some severely depressed - but almost all of them are traumatized from life circumstances and conditioning beyond their control.  \n\nMy dad is an avoidant and also an asshole with no self-awareness and it's hard to have compassion for him.  My ex is an avoidant who is a sweetheart who is able to be self reflective and I have a ton of compassion for him.  \n\nBoth hurt me kinda badly but it's a lot healthier for me to forgive and move on and work on my own shit.

It's almost entire determined by one's own parents.\n\nIf the parent avoided the child, blamed the child for having basic needs, didn't hold/hug the child, or otherwise emtionally neglected the child, then AvPD can arise. The entire idea of intimacy is avoided because it is seen as default rejection from the one person who was supposed to love them. Often the parents are sociopaths, narcissists, or full scale psychopaths. Biological programing for the parent failed the AvPD afflicted child before they were even born.\n\nMany people experience trauma in their childhoods. AvPD afflicted people go beyond normal trauma, and basically crawl their way off one of those ancient Greek baby death mountains and raise themselves. They are some of the toughest humans on earth, but part of their core is always trapped as the scared abandoned child, crying for help on a mountain, alone for miles, with no one one caring enough to help.\n\nWhat this means in practice is that the AvPD person feels that love is earned, and that their emotions are a burden on others. AvPD people tend to need reassurance, and to feel they have earned, or traded in surplus, for any affection they get.  \"Everyone deserves love\" is a lie some kids get, not all.\n\nLoads of AvPD guys tend to go the 'mailorderbride' route for this reason. Because if they are not worth a golden parachute (money, a greencard, a house, love, an escape from poverty, and a new life to an entire family unit) then they are worth nothing. They might as well have died on the Greek mountain. Love is not deserved or gifted. Love is earned, or a simulation of love is rented.\n\nIf anyone is hoping to persue someone with AvPD, you basically have to treat them like a scared wild animal or a traumatised puppy mill dog. Affection has to be applied like a sledge hammer because it cannot be processed any other way. Zero hints. Straight up wrap your arms around them for hours at a time for weeks straight, and get ready for an emotional breakdown months later. People reading this think it's an exageration. It is not. You're looking at setting alarms to get a cuddle schedule, and getting a dedicated blanket.\n\nThey're extremely wounded and need extreme measures.",

I dated a man who was EXTREMELY intelligent. We're talking about graduating in the top 2% at MIT type of guy. I truly enjoyed talking with him, and he loved to teach. Any knowledge he acquired, he wanted to pass along to anybody who would listen. He was very much \"golden retriever\" (ugh, I hate that term) energy when it came to passing along knowledge. \n\nThen, at some point, his attitude shifted when it came to me. If I expressed a dissenting opinion, poked holes in his theories/facts, or showed him he was flat out wrong, he would start talking down to me. It was only with me, seemingly. Then I noticed women didn't really talk to him much, not even colleagues. Before the \"shift,\" he was already becoming a bit exhausting because the conversations had to be deep and meaningful/productive all of the time. When I dumped him, I realized he never had a \"shift\" in personality. He was just good at hiding it for a bit and was always like that.\n\nMy son is profoundly gifted and already has elite schools checking on him, and he's only in middle school. I'm trying to teach him not to be this way. Luckily, he's a very empathetic and loving/caring kid, so he does take corrections easier. Now, when you poke holes in theories he comes up with, he will research and test (what he can) to disprove your poking. And that's the way to do it! He just becomes obsessive with it, so we are working on a healthy balance.",

His insecurity pushed him to be hurtful, insensitive to others\u2019 feelings, and overly sensitive to feedback. My insecurity pushed me to be deferential to his desires, uncommunicative about my feelings, and vengeful when he didn\u2019t care. \n\nI clawed my way outta there and within a few months was on my way to healing.  I think it is rare that someone is \u201cbad\u201d. Hurt people hurt people. I don\u2019t excuse his actions, but I seek to understand. I hope he\u2019s healed from his familial traumas and porn addiction. I hope he stayed single for a bit and learned that he has inherent worth beyond the sexual attention he receives from women\n\nI am now a bit smarter and able to discern overcompensation from comfortable confidence. Plus, I have spent years working on my mental health and building up my internal validation; I am missing nothing from myself, so I pursue friendships/relationships out of leisure and desire, not need and desperation\n\nYes, humility may get you taken advantage of (regardless of gender), but that is part of the inevitable risk of love and sex. We keep honing our characteristics through trial and error. My personal values lead me to prefer an error in which *I* get hurt rather than an error in which I hurt someone else.

There was a study which compared experts to laypeople by having them answer questions  and then rate how confident they were in their answers. Laypeople gave incorrect answers more often but were much less confident that any given answer was correct. Experts gave more correct answers but rated themselves as extremely confident when they gave incorrect answers as correct answers.\n\nMy point is that real intellectuals may enjoy learning something new from discovering they are wrong, but the bar for convincingn them of their error is much higher because their experience is being correct most of the time. Also in my experience intellectuals are very focused on the reasoning process so even if you're right and they're wrong your argument may be inadequate to justify your conclusion so they won't accept it.",

Essentially people who are unsure about their accuracy tend to be unsure exactly how unsure they are whereas the less they know the more answers they get wrong in a linear fashion. \n\nThat means it's a mathematical certainty that any model will show the Dunning Kreuger effect which is why the effect has been critiqued as a weak finding. Because the outcome is mediated primarily by how many questions you get correct the effect can be shown by statistical modeling of a purely hypothetical class, who took a hypothetical test, with hypothetical questions, with hypothetical answers, with a hypothetical level of confidence who got a hypothetical range of scores. Because that model has no \"true\" answers (or questions for that matter) it shows us that the only factor mediating the model is whether the answers produce a certain score (higher if correct, lower if incorrect). Because any real world situation with people involves a range of knowledge and capability it is inevitable that a range of scores will present itself. Dunning Kreuger will assign significance to this even if every hypothetical student has the same confidence level and none of it is real. It's just pure math. \n\nIn essence the only thing Dunning Kreuger functionally shows is that some people get more correct answers than others. The rest is just conjecture, and the popular view of it is dumbed down science.",

Men who are not predators filter out what pick up artists call \"victim chicks\" (predator men instead pick those women purely to abuse them. There are even published \"how to manuals\" for pimps on how to find the most traumatized girls to enslave them). Women on the other hand are more attracted to a man showing his vulnerable side and it brings up \"mothering instincts\" and nurturing socialization in many. So yup, like everything else for the unfortunate predator->prey thing that is men chasing women... can be a complete fabrication.\n\nBut I have also known narcissists whose narcissism stems from having smoke blown up their ass their entire childhood.

I'm someone who needs reassurance too and have my own anxieties for sure, but like... wow, it was a lot, and was verging on being controlling. Nice dude overall who oddly was extremely confident/secure in almost every other aspect of life, and will make someone else very happy someday, but I could not handle the anxiety being projected on me all the time when I had other life stressors to worry about too.",

                    "body": "Real quick edit no idea why part of my comment is bold. \n\nI will say this about the subject and I'm only replying to you because it was the original comment. \n\nI've been told I'm like this by a lot of people but there's a few things about it. \n\n#1- As somebody else said, it's a foreign subject to them and myself how some people just wake up happy feeling great about the world every single day no matter what happens. Minds are wired differently and no you don't need to date them but some people have trauma that is irreversible. \n\n#2-People who are overly positive in the opposite fashion are not quite the same but run a really strong parallel in terms of just sitting there listening to these people rolling my eyes constantly. It's not uncommon that their life is in shambles too but yet they want to walk around talking like everything is flowers and bubblegum. \n\n#3-Even based off culture, down to the person perspective is everything. What's positive or negative to some people is normal in different cultures. \n\nBut more importantly I think what a lot of people forget in summary is that positive and negative is a social construct from man. \n\nSome people think that humans are inherently good and some people think that humans are inherently evil. \n\nThese are the two sides of the coin with respective that we're talking about with everything in this situation. \n\nIt really doesn't exist. Humans are animals and they act like animals. We have developed a language that we understand and everybody seems to think that we're so intelligent when at the end of the day we just act like animals. We eat, we use the bathroom all day, we get mad we get happy we react. We have sex, we look for the next thing to consume. At the end of the day it's just vision on how people see all of those things. \n\nHumans are inherently selfish because it's programmed into our biological system to survive and that leads to choices that serve the person first. So from someone like my perspective that I happen to think negatively about most people it's because most people are naturally self-serving and what you call negativity 100% for me is just talking about openly what's factual: people are not walking around looking to be nice or serve others. They only do it when it's convenient and the world is not a positive place. It's not necessarily a negative place either. It's just a place where both things happen frequently and choosing to say it's good or bad it's just something that copes with it the way you feel necessary and is not right or wrong. \n\nAlmost nobody is walking around doing things out of the goodness of their heart and everybody gets something out of what they're doing at all times. There's even psychological data and articles behind people who are people pleasers and who do random acts of kindness It's because they get chemical rewards. It's because they are programmed to do those things not necessarily that they inherently want to even. And because people understand psychology so little they don't even know that they're incapable of not being nice positive people all the time. \n\nSo again as a final thought people are just neutral and if it's draining being around somebody who's negative all day in your opinion then I totally get it. \n\nBut it's just one side of the coin.",

Every\u2026.single\u2026..time. The pans are inside a closed shelf, you cannot see them. And I use the same pan 99% of the time which is right in the \u201cmiddle\u201d size of course. \n\nI just lay that pan right on top of all the others because I use it every day and it\u2019s a fucking pain in the ass to bend down, pull out ALL the pans, place a pan in the exact spot in the stack, then pick them all up and place them back inside the shelf. It makes no sense to me. Eventually she gave up on caring if it was organized and I am much happier.",

I want no part in it.\n\nI think it's somehow childhood trauma related I'm so averse to any of it.

It might be sustainable without kids, but once kids are brought into the household the wife is overwhelmed and overworked. The husband then wonders why his wife doesn\u2019t take care of herself, is always angry or annoyed and doesn\u2019t want to have sex with them anymore. It\u2019s obvious to the outsider that no one wants to have sex with someone they view as a child, but he doesn\u2019t think very deeply. He just thinks that she changed after marriage. He will go on and remarry so he destroys another woman\u2019s life. In the meantime, his ex wife has a glow up and he wonders why she couldn\u2019t do that while they were married. It\u2019s a modern story that repeats itself over and over.",

The guy was problematic in multiple ways including being physically abusive and then blaming me for being violent. He also wanted me to be his mom and solve all his problems. \"Be sweet please; girls are supposed to be sweet\" every time I got upset about something.\n\nThe next fella I ended up with was openly Republican and was raised like that. He didn't hide it from me but he was nice and I decided to give him a chance. I noticed over time that some of his beliefs didn't fit Republican thinking. We could talk about politics and some of the things he said were not senseless tbh. I noticed he did not agree with Republicans on most things especially social issues.\n\n~~Less~~ A little over a year into dating the 2016 election happened. He didn't want to vote for Trump but did because he thought he had to support Republicans, I remember telling him he did not have to but he didn't seem to know what else he could do.\n\nWithin the first part of 2017 he regretted his vote starting with the \"Muslim ban\". Tried the \"maybe I am really a Libertarian thing\" but eventually he tells me that he thinks they are even worse. Now he is a registered Democrat, and is willing to tackle on difficult conversations with his family (unfortunately with no success). We still complain about Democrats together, but I think he wanted to make a statement with his new registration.\n\nHe has turned out to be a great husband tbh. We were younger, and even back then I didn't anticipate that Republicans would go as low as they have.\n\nPoint being: Secret Republicans are the absolute worst. My now-husband wasn't ashamed of being a Republican because of sheltered ignorance. My ex knew he supported unpopular ideas but those ideas were favorable towards groups he identifies with.\n\nEdited: a couple words.",

Spending days messaging someone to try to get their intentions is a waste of everyone\u2019s time, unless you\u2019re trying to trick someone into something they don\u2019t want, which is likely why they\u2019re vague.",

Did we forget to send my nephew a birthday card?\"). It's expected that the Mom figure will take the burden of the daily grind tasks, and if the Mom doesn't, the recipient partner's life falls apart and the house turns into chaos. Dishes don't get done, laundry piles up, food goes out of date, etc etc. The mental burden of tasks are commonly overlooked here. Edit: asking the Mom partner for a to-do list also counts because the burden is now on them to act as a Project Manager and direct the tasks. The Mom partner shouldn't have to make a list; the other person should use their eyes and notice what needs to be done. \n\nThat's where the reciprocity comes into play too. If it's a love language, the acts of service go both ways (even if the recipient partner's love language is not acts of service, they will make an effort to reciprocate by doing nice things because they know it's important to their partner).\n\nTo answer the question directly, I suppose I would draw the line as soon as I felt my partner expected me to do certain acts of service for them, and as soon as I felt it was unreasonably one-sided.",

I had been travelling for work, and found that he'd just let dirty dishes sit for two days without so much as rinsing. Then after reminding him, I'd went to put the dry, clean dishes away and noticed that he'd neglected to clean the underside of the dishes (they'd been stacked on top of one another when dirty).

Unhygienic is a spectrum that people accept at different levels. \n\nIt's unacceptable to argue you're being nitpicky when you simply have different standards. It's still a problem in the relationship, but it doesn't necessarily involve harmful gender expectations. \n\nA major source of this, IMHO, is something I've noticed between the men and the women in my life. Men, when faced with a task they don't want to do, tend to be much more willing to rationalize the task away. They feel that lowering standards negatively affects them far less than a dirty kitchen. \n\nIf a wife/gf is acting as their Mom, it saves them from having to face the consequences of their inaction, making it easier to rationalize the task away in the future. That's not fair or acceptable, but it doesn't mean they are acting this way because they have an expectation of their wife/gf (as you say).\n\nHaving lived with male roommates in the past, this is often standard. The tasks are completed when the task cannot be procrastinated/rationalized away anymore. They aren't looking for a Mom, it just doesn't bother them too much. \n\nI think that framing the problem in this way can be helpful in bridging the communication gap and fixing the issue. Otherwise, the wife/gf's complaints end up being the consequences to inaction, rather than ants/smells/no dishes. It's clearly unfair to the wife/gf, but it's also unfair to cast such a situation as being the man's sexism rather than low standards.\n\nBy bridging this gap with my fiancee, we have been able to center these differences in standards and come to agreements where collectively we work to meet her most critical standards, but for others she can relax her expectations. She is generally less stressed about cleanliness nowadays, and I generally feel that I am not wasting a lot of time doing tasks I feel are completely unnecessary (dusting, avoiding ALL clutter, weekly vacuuming, loading the dishwasher to her exact specifications, etc). \n\nWe are also now more aware when I am doing a task simply because I want to help meet her expectations, and when she is doing a task that I don't feel is necessary but can still appreciate---it has fostered a much more grateful communication style, which, in turn, has helped us keep a much cleaner living environment.",

For me it's a couple things.\n\nFirst, are you capable of doing the tasks?  If the wife/girlfriend is gone for a week, do dishes/laundry/etc. just continually pile up, either because you can't do them or because you won't do them?\n\nSecond, do you notice and appreciate that the chores you didn't have to do were done?\n\nI know a couple where it turned out the dude went directly from his mom to his wife without ever taking care of himself, at all.  His parents, who lived a several hour drive each way away, would come about every other weekend and do all his laundry, dishes, cleaning, yard work, etc. because he was their special boy.  The wife never realized how incapable he was because his apartment/house was never that far off being well taken care of.  When they got married, now this was all her job even though they both worked full time.\n\nHonestly I think she'd still be with him if he showed even a D+ level of appreciation for it, but he still had big \"I'm the main character\" energy even in his 40s.",

She cut off a lot of not great people in her life when she figured out she was having me, and was already estranged from her family of origin. Because she didn't have the skills to build healthy relationships, she didn't try, kind of setting a boundary against needing to have boundaries.\u00a0The end result was that while she didn't model unhealthy social interactions, she also didn't model healthy ones for me. I ended up lacking some of the tools to build my own healthy relationships until I left home and figured it out on my own through trial and error.\u00a0\n\n\nThe fact you know you're autistic is gonna be huge for your kiddo. My mom didn't get diagnosed til I was an adult so she never understood it, and couldn't teach me about my own autism while I was growing up with it.

I can absolutely see myself already going down the path of not having people in my life and can see how that modeling will be important for my son down the line. That is important and I am going to take that to heart. \n\nMan I wish I had never told his father and ran away when he started waving his red flags everywhere in my face. Life would have been a lot easier and better. \n\nIf I hadn't gone through his diagnosing I would have been left wondering so many things about why I am the way I am, pouring over the DSM5 trying to self diagnose. Lol then I started asking my mom questions about my childhood and it all unfurled like a blooming flower. I am trying to remember my challenges as a kid and do better for my kid, the things I needed and didn't get. I hope it works. \n\nThank you!",

Maybe it's time to take a breather, live a bit. Take a sabbatical and re-evaluate work-life balance. Backpack a long trail, travel internationally, work in service or retail related to something you truly enjoy.\n\nThen you ease back into career work and resume working toward FI goals at a more sustainable pace and open mind. Maybe retiring at 35 or 40 or 45 isn't the goal. Maybe it's some form of semi-retirement - part time work or \"fun\" employment. Maybe it's a chance to start your own small business. Maybe you now plan for a sabbatical every 3-5 years.\n\nI think that initial period of set-up is exhausting, but ultimately really helpful.

I patch my socks when they get a hole and I repair anything I can within reason. But if I want a nice vacation or something nice and I have the money, I take it (within reason). \n\nI have a friend who\u2019s so cheap. She penny pinches everything and it always ends up costing her more. She was buying her first place a couple years ago for just her, no partner or kids or even a pet. She had been living in her parent\u2019s dining room with nothing but a twin mattress on the floor for 3 years while making 80k this whole time so it\u2019s not even like she had a great living situation she would have to give up. She is also incredibly indecisive already and has a big fear of commitment. \n\nShe insisted on looking at houses in a pretty expensive area so all she could find her in her very tight budget were houses in terrible shape. Even when you pointed out a place in much better shape thats 10k out of her budget and explained how that works out to only a few dollars difference in the mortgage on a month to month basis over 30 years, she\u2019d never get past that 10k. No matter how ideal it was otherwise. Instead she\u2019d look at absolute shit boxes that were under or at that magic number for her. They\u2019d need a whole new roof (definitely cost more than 10k) and might have plumbing or foundation issues (thousands of dollars there) etc but she\u2019d start considering it because it had central air and that was on her must haves. Never mind that the HVAC was 20 years old and probably needed to be replaced (again, thousands of dollars and would wipe out that 10k savings in a second). \n\n\nMe and her family kept telling her she could easily get a condo, especially because she was very limited on the area she wanted, but she insisted on a house. She is also not handy at all and does not want to learn how to do a lot of these major renovations on her own. After the 10th or more place that she ALMOST put an offer on and agonized over and made me listen to her twist herself in knots about, I was finally like, look, shit or get off the pot. Either put an offer in on a place, or I don\u2019t want to hear about any place you look at until you have signed the paperwork. I\u2019m done. Maybe you\u2019re not ready to buy and that\u2019s fine but if that\u2019s the case either find an apartment or get ready to plan your 40th birthday party in your parent\u2019s dining room. She bought a condo.",

However i wont do Narcissists, Bipolar, or bpd. one you cant reason with, the second and third are not always compliant on their meds and even so its a treatment not a cure, and the last one just triggers me from my mom who had BPD  \n  \nYou can\u2019t love someone back to health. Wish you could.\n\nTW SI, SU\n\nI was actually a therapist for 5 years, and my ex was exactly this. I tried everything\u2014I mean, I set boundaries as far as I could, told him I'm there for him but I\u2019m not his therapist, and he needs some professional help. He later told me that when I said that, he decided he could never tell me anything or trust me again, and it was that moment when he stopped trying in the relationship.\n\nI got him on meds, got him in therapy, supported him unconditionally. I was getting calls from the police saying that they were there for a welfare check and nobody was answering. He told me he was taking out my guns and looking at them with the ideation. I had to take all the meds and guns out of the house. Eventually, we went distant as I got accepted to an academic program near his family (me wanting to be supportive) 160 miles away, and he backed out at the last minute saying, \u201cMy family is bad for my mental health.\u201d I was driving 360 miles every weekend, worried I was gonna find his body.  \nAfter all of that failed, I damn near had to put him on an M-1 hold. I poured everything I had into that, mind, body, and soul. I became depressed myself, gained 30 lbs, and was and am still struggling from a chronic illness I\u2019d had for 7 years by this point. I thought maybe I was asking too much because with depression, even the smallest things were big. He only had to do two things: keep the place clean and go to school.\n\nI was covering my mortgage while he lived in my house and paying my own rent while I let him keep my dog for 6 months because he \"missed me.\" He would occasionally drive down and spend the weekend with his family, and I\u2019d get an hour, maybe 2, if I was lucky. I poured 30k into that man over a year just supporting him.\n\nIn the end, I found out he\u2019d spent basically the past year or two portraying me as some controlling oppressor who didn\u2019t let him do anything, despite us being distant for about 9 months. I also found out he wasn\u2019t going to school and getting high all day while neglecting my dog and letting her get fat.\n\nI gave and gave and gave, and the funny part is, in the end, he broke up with me.  \nWe were actually working on things for about 6 months after, but then his mother had a psychotic break at 3 am on my birthday (I was there for that too), and after she became lucid again, I realized they sounded exactly the same. That is when I knew he was never going to change. His family was a bunch of toxic, druggie, alcoholic thieves and white-collar criminals, or bums with no life, and he worshipped them.\n\nMy entire life has been dedicated to helping others, but this\u2026 this fucked me up. I just passed 1 year broken up, and it still has me fucked up. I cried about it earlier today, actually\u2014just for a moment.  \nGiven my past job, I know the pitfalls I can fall into, and I have a higher level of awareness of my own thought processes, and I recognized that because I can identify pitfalls and maladaptive behaviors, it\u2019s my responsibility to work on them. But fuck, it has been hard. I\u2019ve been incredibly angry\u2014at him, myself, the world, everyone.\n\nIt is a daily task to choose anything but that.  \nOne day at a time.  \nNEVER AGAIN.  \nTLDR: You can\u2019t love someone back to health.",

Some people at least maintain enough motivation to seek therapy, to research it themselves, to experiment a little with their routines, and through these processes they might eventually be able to work there way out. Others completely shut down even from initiating treatment and will only, maybe, emerge from their depression if something external shakes up their life circumstances enough to inject new motivations.\n\nFrom one angle, the difference between those two is in the severity of the depression. From another angle, behind the more severe depression, the second will usually have much deeper, long-term issues, such as lower personal insight, an absence of earlier training in habits of self-care and self-improvement, fewer external sources of support and motivation; they also might be engaged in behaviours that reinforce and sustain their depression, like addictions.\n\nAnyway, as far as this thread goes, that's way, way more than any person should be reasonably expected to deal with in dating. Hell, even a professional therapist is going to struggle with a client who has yet to reach the motivations to book and maintain appointments.",

It\u2019s a vicious cycle.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to diagnose someone with something like narcissism, you should be required to provide a path towards redemption for that person: \u201cif you do this and this and this, I will no longer think you\u2019re a narcissist.\u201d Otherwise, you\u2019re sealing them into a social-psychological prison, and telling them that they are less than human.

I know \"therapy\" is the catch-all remedy these days, but if that doesn't work, or you can't find it for some reason, here are my recommendations (based on living with a covert narcissist for 2 years.)\n\n1. Dig deep and figure out why you want to be with a person. Do you just need a change of scenery? A place to live? A ride? A housekeeper? Stuff you don't have? \n\n2. If an argument isn't resolved, it's not over. Just because you walk away and declare it \"done,\" while the other retreats, they're still wondering what is going on, and how to resolve the issue. Pretending everything is fine, and feigning amnesia after 15 minutes doesn't resolve the issue in your partner's head - or in reality. They may follow your lead and think, \"Oh, all is quiet, so it's ok now\" but it's not. Unresolved issues will arise again and again until they're *truly* resolved, and that means verbal understanding from both.\n\n2a. If you blame your partner solely for a fight/argument they're confused about, examine your role in the fight/argument.\n\n3. Don't gaslight. This isn't the same as lying. Example: my ex would fail to say something, then claim I just didn't hear him because I'm old, therefore deaf (I'm not.) \n\n4. If you're going to cheat, just get out of the relationship instead of lying, gaslighting and manipulating. Ask yourself *why* you would want to maintain two relationships, assuming you're not in an open relationship. Got kids? Believe me - kids are better off knowing you and the other parent are breaking up, rather than be part of your charade.\n\n5. If you become a different person while drinking or consuming substances, stop. If you have trouble stopping, then get help. Another example: My progressive ex became a raging homophobe one night while getting stupid drunk. On another occasion, he became suspicious of our immigrant neighbors. (We were all friends) Many other stories, but if you're told you're a \"Jekyll and Hyde,\" you should seek substance treatment as well.",

The idea of giving someone a bit of space to calm down from their overwhelm is not scary to me, and when someone can't reciprocate my effort in a relationship or communicate in a healthy way, I find it easy to end that relationship and go looking for someone more suitable. It's not damaging to me to experience one or two  instances of someone failing to reciprocate or communicate before I break up with them over it. \n\nBut when someone is clingy and jealous and says things like \"If you loved me you would reassure me when I feel anxious,\" or \"If you loved me, you'd spend more time with me when I am feeling insecure,\" I find that exponentially harder to deal with. Anxiously attached people *hate* that I have healthy boundaries because they feel boundaries indicate a lack of love. And it is quite a lot damaging to me to experience even just one or two instances of boundary violations or privacy violations! Even when I end the relationship, I've still been **violated** in some way and this requires a lot more effort and time to heal.",

She actually touched me affectionately (not sexually) and I immediately had a reaction and was like wow this is new to me and it should not feel that way after a 7 year relationship with someone. It was really nice, but also made me sad.

Some things on this list, like a lack of reciprocity and communication, are things I've learned to demand in my relationships and then leave immediately when there is a 2x failure of either. No third chances. It's possible to protect myself from these behaviors. Some other of these (like ignoring, neglecting, and suddenly dumping) are obviously super painful and devastating when I've fallen for them. Been there, done that, had my heart broken. It hurts to love someone whose boundaries are more like solid rock walls. \n\nBut the experience of heartbreak is *nothing* compared to what an anxious attacher can put someone through. Anxiously attached people's idea of love is parasitical, they will forcibly cling until they have sucked you dry, and then blame you for being too shriveled up to give them anything more. They won't just leave you alone and dump you like avoidants. I wish they would! In fact even after you break up with them many will stalk you online or IRL because of how clingy they are and how hard they find it to let go. It is an altogether different level of terror to date an anxious attacher IME. *They have no concept of boundaries at all.* That is fucking scary!",

If you ever do come into crisis, the value of having an established relationship with a therapist who already knows you and you trust is immeasurable. \n\nYou don't have to do the intense emotional labor of establishing a relationship with a therapist who may or may not be a good fit for you, all while in the midst of a crisis. It can be prohibitively daunting to develop a good relationship with a therapist when you are already psychologically overwhelmed.\n\nI wish that having an established therapist was as normalized as having a primary medical care provider.

People have sex mainly because it feels good. We develop needs, behaviours, and emotional tendencies that emerge influenced by the evolutionary process of course which may a lot to do with social survivability, but you can't call all of these behaviors \"social\"  in origin for this reason.\n\nImo differences in the commonly accepted societal concepts of exclusivity/marriage/monogamy etc. are easier to explain as a consequence of the varied tolerances and needs of people towards exclusivity, multiple partnerships and sexual variety. My intuition is that the societys rules ultimately depend on numbers (put a bit simply majority monogamy-preferers would tend to give a monogamous society) and power (polygamy-prefering leaders and figures would tend to give a more polygamous societies).\n\nRegardless of the origins it is clear IMO that people tend to have different needs for exclusivity/loyalty vs promiscuity which often results in a lot of drama.",

It usually occurs starting in childhood when a parent isn\u2019t getting their emotional needs fulfilled by other adults so instead they turn to a child. They talk to a child about their problems that the child shouldn\u2019t have to deal with. For example when one parent confides in the child about marital issues. The relationship revolves around fulfilling the parents emotional needs instead of the child\u2019s. In adulthood the golden child is too close with their parent and functions as a surrogate spouse.",

Because dogs honestly require more attention (I have had both, trust me on this one).\n\nWildly disagree on that one.  (And respectfully...with a username like that, you *may* not be the most impartial judge on the matter haha)\n\nJust the daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly maintenance of owning horses is dramatically more involved, expensive, and lifestyle defining than having a dog, not even counting any specific shows/events you may want to do with them.\n\nWith a dog, you need food, vet visits occasionally, and maybe some meds on a recurring basis.\n\nWith horses, you need a barn/stable, a fenced field, saddle, tack, dedicated equipment for feeding, bathing grooming, etc.  Vets making house calls, maybe the horseshoe person (forget the occupation name) if you're shoeing, etc.\n\nAnd that's assuming you never take your animals anywhere or participate in any sort of events with them.  \n\nIf you do anything like that, now you're also throwing in a trailer, a truck that can haul it, all the extra gear to travel with the horse, all the specialized clothing that the rider wears...\n\nSimply put, almost anyone who leads an independent lifestyle can be a dog owner.  But if you have horses, being a horse person is likely the aspect that has the most impact on your overall lifestyle.  It drives where you live, what you drive, if/how/when/where you can vacation, what other activities you tend to do...many of the friends you make...and can even drive things like career choices, college picks, school sporting activities, etc.\n\nIt's also going to dominate the decision making factors in your love life too, in some way, to one side or the other.  Either the horse person is going to leave it all behind or their partner is going to have to fully buy into the horse person life as well.\n\nHonestly, after being in a serious relationship with a horse person for like 2.5 years, that was one of the many factors that led to our breakup: basically she was already planning out how we'd marry, buy property adjoining her childhood home, never leave our small hometown, how all of \"our vacations\" would really be driving her and the horses to competitions, how I'd use my skills and training as a side hustle in the horse business to make extra cash...to roll back into the horse stuff...\n\n...you get the idea.\n\nBasically if you make the decision to be with a horse person, you're also marrying that lifestyle, and forgetting about anything else you may have wanted that isn't seamlessly compatible with it.\n\nAnd with all that *it's not a horrible thing*...it comes with the territory.  But let's just not pretend that it's not a massive life commitment.\n\nHell, I really learned so much about the lifestyle and really came to love horses in the time we were together, too...but I just wasn't willing to totally forget about any of my hopes and dreams and fit this role that was already predetermined for whoever she'd eventually get to fill that role.\n\n...and spoiler alert...that was maybe 15-17 years ago when we were in our early 20s.  And while we aren't in touch at all anymore, the last time I bumped into her or got an update, nobody had filled that role.\n\nPart of it was absolutely her personality...but another part is that extra level of giving up whatever you may have wanted in order to be the horse-person-partner that they want you to be.",

I compete maybe 3-4 a year, less now that we have kids. I never made my husband come to a horse show, I go out to the barn 3-4 times a week and spend a few hours there. So 10 hours a week for my main hobby? Doesn't seem too bad. \n\nMeanwhile, my friends buddy had to bow out of a weekends guy trip because he couldn't find someone to watch his dog.",

My mom made a post on social media for my birthday, saying happy birthday OP and happy half-gotcha day to horse's name. Not only did she post about her horse on MY birthday, but she got the math wrong! Also, her horses birthday is my middle brother's birthday. So basically on any of our birthdays it's about us and the horse. \nVery weird. \nShe wouldn't let us get certain things ( like clothes and stuff we needed for school!) because we didn't have enough money, but then spends literal thousands on her horse every month. \nIdk tis very weird.",

                            "body": "Have you gone unmedicated before? I mean after starting, have you ever taken a long term break? My type 2 partner was medicated for years, started an intellectually demanding new job in litigation, and within a few months claimed that he could not be on mood stabilizers anymore because they are a risk to his job, because of their blunting effect on his brain. Said they make him too fuzzy. He was working as an attorney for years with medication, but doing work (probate, contact, copyright, etc) that was less mentally demanding than the litigation job. \n\nMy position since we first started dating (and also before we agreed to move in together and get much more serious about a life together) was that I was there to be a supportive and understanding teammate and could roll with the realities of being with someone with bipolar disorder, with the one requirement that a medication to stabilize mood (whatever form or type that may be) would be part of the regimen. I was clear that a bipolar partner who chooses to be unmedicated, no matter how valid their reason, was not something I was willing to put myself through. I specifically brought this up at the beginning so that this position was very clear, that refusing to be medicated was a dealbreaker. \n\nSo fast forward a year, where he\u2019s a few months into his awesome new job, that he loves and is great at, and he says he can\u2019t take his current med anymore, and wants to try going without daily mood stabilizer med due to the risk to his job; instead his doctor offered him a \u201cbreak glass in case of emergency\u201d prescription med that could be taken to kill a manic episode of one started brewing or was happening. I was against this, but said we could try it if he felt it was necessary, as long as he authorized me to contact his doc directly in the event of concern. \n\nAll was fine until I went out of town for a week, and the evening of the day id left, the manic came on. He tried to hide it from me, finally admitted yes that\u2019s what was happening, 2days later. Missed a day of work because of it. \n\nGot back on lamictal and took it for 5 days before deciding that no, his head was fuzzy again, that wouldn\u2019t work. I said I just want to make sure that you\u2019re still committed to being medicated with something for mood stabilization, which no, your Wellbutrin doesn\u2019t count for this; because that\u2019s for the depression, and the risk (to you, to us, to your job) is the mania. He wouldn\u2019t reaffirm his commitment to that, saying in response, over and over, that he\u2019s \u201copen to medication but not going to take anything that puts my job at risk, being fuzzy is a bigger risk to my job than a manic episode would be.\u201d\n\nI said you know going unmedicated with no intention to get back on one is, and has always been, a dealbreaker for me. We tried it, against my better judgement, because I wanted to be supportive, but it didn\u2019t work, you had a manic episode and lied to me during it. If you can\u2019t commit to medication as agreed in the beginning of this, then I\u2019m gone.\n\nHis response was that that was a toxic ultimatum, that I was trying to force him to be medicated and that\u2019s fucked up. I said it\u2019s not an ultimatum I\u2019m not trying to force you to do anything \u2014 it\u2019s MY boundary/dealbreaker, and I\u2019m the one who will be forced to take an action to protect myself, (leave/break up) if you can\u2019t confirm that you\u2019re still committed to mood stabilizing medication. I\u2019m not forcing you to do anything, I\u2019m saying what I\u2019ve said since day 1, that if you\u2019re not going to mitigate the risk of manic episodes with meds, I will have to exit for my own sake. \n\nIs that how you would see that \u2014 as an ultimatum that is trying to force you to do something (take meds)? Maybe this is a question better posed to one of the bipolar subs, but I\u2019m curious as to just how unreasonable my position is, from the POV of someone with bipolar 2. I realize that\u2019s a long ass comment and if goes unread/unanswered, I totally understand, lol",

For the longest time, I went unmedicated, but I didn't know any better. I thought everyone felt like this: extreme highs and extreme lows. It wasn't until one day, i came home, and it was an amazing day, or should have been? Within 20 minutes, I was on the ground, crying and having a fucking meltdown because it literally felt like everything was too good to be true and the world is caving in on me. I was like, \"This isn't normal, something is wrong with me.\" Saw my psychiatrist and therapist, and was immediately diagnosed.\n\nMy partner, whom I've been with for 10 years, had no idea or ever accused me of being bipolar. He just knew I was this spontaneous, free-spirited, emotional spitfire, and he fell in love with it. That doesn't mean everything is easy breezy between us. When my episodes turn bad (i.e. all of a sudden angry, everything is messy and disorganized and needs to be fixed, \"don't touch me\"), he is literally, and I mean literally, the only one who will stand up to me, and in the softest and kindest voice, tell me to \"knock it the fuck off and calm down.\" \n\nIf anyone else were to tell me that during one of my episodes, I would absolutely flip my lid. But it's him. He has seen a lot of my shit, without batting an eye. When he gives me that look and tells me to knock it off, in the most gentlest manner, a wave of calmness comes over me and reality hits me: \"Damn, I am being crazy and need to tone it the fuck down.\" \n\nI certainly don't deserve him. He knows I need the medication, as well as I do. He would support me in whatever decision I make. I personally feel like yes, the medicine does take away some of my \u2728\ufe0fpizzazz\u2728\ufe0f But it also makes life liveable and helps me think more logically. Trust me, I'm still this spontaneous, free-spirited, emotional spitfire. But I'm not about to go get a new drug addiction, up and quit my stable job, sleep with someone I shouldn't, smoke weed on a university property and almost get expelled (all real life examples from my life). That's just my experience. \n\nAMA I'm a type 2 Bipolar gal. Lol",

I didn't know she had bipolar until the day she was apparently going to write me a text message apologising for accusing me of trying to steal her boyfriend (never tried, never wanted to) and that was the thing that \"tipped her over the edge\" and she was admitted to a psych ward. My friend was going to break up with her a few days before this happened, but then felt bad about it. \n\nShe was in the ward for several months, having all sorts of hallucinations and accusing people of bizarre things until they found the right dosages to get her back to \"normal\". When she was finally released, she was no longer on birth control and convinced him they should start a family, and she got pregnant pretty quickly. Apparently she wasn't able to take her medication whilst pregnant so went off of it again very quickly, and I don't think she has gone back on it since giving birth. \n\nShe claims to not remember anything about the months before going into the ward and whilst she was there, but she still refuses to speak to me and threatens suicide or to sleep with my friend's mates if my friend wants to meet up with me, even when she is invited too. \n\nI know not everyone with bipolar is like that but it's enough for me to not want to get involved.",

Meanwhile metal is my favorite genre out of many,  and they barely knew anything about the bands that were playing, even though I had been listening to them for ages and play guitar in a garage metal band ?  Her friends eventually convinced her to ditch me, all while she insisted that I get a ride an hour and a half away to the concert and she and her best friend would take me back home. That didn\u2019t happen and it was an outdoor arena and started pouring. Before they cast me away, I begged them to tell me what I did and they literally just kept flipping their wrists saying h go away go away. I thought I was freaking dreaming.

If you haven't worked extensively with livestock or been out in the fields dealing with your crops, then you have no business pretending you embody the lifestyle. It's just being fake, which is a huge turnoff. \n\nAnd those that are actually country girls usually tend to be really tomboyish in the least attractive way possible (for a heterosexual man). I'm talking heavy clothes, covered in dirt or mud and when you're working with livestock usually some manure or other fluid from an animal. I have nothing against girls doing traditional guy stuff, like playing contact sports or being a mechanic, but I just feel like the agricultural lifestyle doesn't make that stuff attractive.

Bi men are in a unique situation where they live in both worlds, having access to easy hookups with men while also experiencing the much more difficult hookup culture straight men go through. This leads some bi men to enter a committed relationship with a woman to satisfy the desire for sex with women but still having that desire for frequent NSA hookups with men. Do bi men cheat more often? idk I don't have data on that, but there's a specific kind of pressure to cheat that only bi men will understand and that is what this person is getting at.

That's weird.\n\n\nAnyway, my child is now 18 and at uni, I was married when I had her but young.

Simply put, a dogmatic stance on either side of this topic doesn't make sense, good people can see it very differently and there's no inherent wrongdoing involved with either position.  I will concede though that plenty of people do get it wrong and adopt their position for the wrong reasons, I've seen that on both sides of the issue too.......religion being a prime example on one side, and bad faith operators prowling about on the other.

There these meetings and special steps and if you don\u2019t meet certain criteria, you\u2019re not an addict so you\u2019re excluded. This kind of attitude persists with personal things.\n\nSecondly, Addicts in recovery view every single action and reaction of other people as potential signs for addiction. It\u2019s this constant nagging of don\u2019t this, don\u2019t that. And even when it\u2019s not projected onto you, it exists in their own self. \u201cI can\u2019t this, I can\u2019t that\u201d. Which brings me to\n\nMost importantly it\u2019s a very limiting mindset and worldview to have. There is a lot more freedom in our world than addicts \u201ccan handle\u201d. A formor alcoholic can never have a drink, set foot in a bar or even a food that might taste like alcohol. \u201cIt might be was makes it all topple down.\u201d It\u2019s a fear filled mindset that I think people adopt because they have failed many many times to figure out how the world works and need to be told. They need the rule system to function and outside of those strong boundaries is off limits forever. \n\nNot to mention how many addicts seem to be stuck in the life they were living when they got addicted. The final result is a hallowed out shell of a person who is full of fear and probably still addicted to something, yet they carry an air of superiority because they learned to quit something else.",

            "body": "Type 3 hat guys. In my experience at college, there are three types of hat guys. \n\nType 1) Safe. they wear a hat when the situation calls for a hat. It's sunny, or cold, or Texas, and you need to wear a head accessory to be comfortable.\n\nType 2) Safe (usually). they're balding and ashamed of the lack of hair and haven't bitten the bullet and gone bald. For jocks, this leads to shame and a threat to their masculinity, so they may act out, but usually mellow after a bit. For nerds, it also leads to shame but they usually wear cute hats to hide it and it's like tropical bird mating dances. When a pokemon girl sees a Bulbasaur cotton beanie, she may desire to investigate.\n\nType 3) Not safe. these are the guys who wear hats as a constant accessory and for the sole reason that they think they look good in the hat. (They do not look good in their hats) You will never see them without a hat. For nerdy types, this is usually a fedora. For jocks, it's a baseball hat that still has a sticker on it and never once been sweat on. These guys usually feel entitled to female attention and get personally \"attacked\" when rejected.",

Any time her kids were over her son would never fall asleep and would keep asking for water and calling for his mom.  On top of that her only response to her children was to yell at them. We both worked at the same company and so when the Christmas break came around, where we got almost 10 days off in a row, behind my back she agreed to take her kids for our entire break preventing us from doing anything for ourselves.\n\nWe went to a movie one time with her kids and her daughter tried to grab a woman's hair sitting in front of us in the theater. So after that I felt like we couldn't go do anything with her kids out in public. Her son had issues going to the bathroom. Granted he was like 3 or 4 years old but he would piss himself regularly. His mother's excuse was that their father and step mother would allow them to be around a similarly aged cousin that was still wearing diapers and she thought being around that cousin was causing this behavior.\n\nI told her that she should tell their father and his wife to keep that cousin away from their son to stop this behavior. She was like \"I can't tell them he can't be around his cousin.\" Or something like that. Without discussing with me she agreed to buy a vehicle off of her mother for well over sticker price because her mother was trying to become a semi driver. She was going to be paying a lot of money each month and she couldn't even save any money up. She was living paycheck to paycheck even though we split bills together.\n\nAfter we had our falling out she tried to have an ex boyfriend move into my property with her till she saved enough money to move back around where her kids lived. That was maybe an hour and a half away driving. I threatened to have him arrested if she tried. She moved out and got back together with him but when she came back for her stuff she brought him and threatened to call police on me if I said anything about her kids and their fathers house to DCFS. Their fathers house had padlocks on the outsides of their children's bedrooms. They had a lot of problems beyond just that. The locks on her sons room is probably why he kept soiling himself. \n\n\nLong story short don't date single moms that don't have custody. There's a good reason they don't have custody.",

At the beginning of our relationship, he assured me that it didn't matter and that it would never be an issue, but his parents and siblings abhorred my lack of sharing in their beliefs. They weren't shy about making their suboptimal opinions of me known, and they constantly pressured him into trying to convert me. This affected our relationship in major way, and inevitably, our relationship ended.\n\nI've also met other Christians who are so full of love and embrace the beauty in individuality, so I understand that not everyone is the same, but, based on my own failed experience, I could never again commit to anything more than a platonic friendship.

I initially thought the night was going pretty good, we were all just chatting and enjoying the music. At some point i noticed he went quiet and started acting... pouty? I asked him what was wrong but he just stormed off and left the concert. I followed him to the parking lot and he basically told me he was sad because he felt like everyone was ignoring him. I stayed with him in the parking lot basically the whole night and he just kept complaining the whole time making it worse. He was also pissed my friends wouldn't come out sooner for him? which was stupid because they didn't even really like him and they bought their own tickets. Should've seen this as a red flag but i missed it somehow, he got way worse after ugh.",

However, I've found myself with these folks several times, and I think sometimes this behavior only comes out later on. I'm always grateful when that becomes clear BEFORE a lot of emotions have been invested.\n\nI think there are some people who maliciously pick things apart as a form of begging. Like the guy who I'd gone on 3 or 4 dates with before eden I had him come over to eat a home cooked meal I made for him. He basically started complaining almost immediately and rattling off a laundry list of everything I'd done \"wrong\" or \"could have done better\" with the cooking while we were eating, yet he cleaned his plate. Bruh could have just said \"i don't care for this\" or \"this isn't to my taste\" and we could have moved on from it but instead he roasted me and my cooking skills. I broke it off with him that night, roomies more than happily helped me polish the leftovers from that meal off the next day.\n\nI think there are also people who unintentionally pick things apart, whether out of genuine curiosity or intellectualism or something like that. I still can't handle that sometimes though. Like the last person I tried to date really wanted me to pick apart the reasons why I liked certain movies or shows. While I can be fine with discussions about things I like, I don't anyways want to dig into the minutiae of it, comb over all the fine details of it, and have to explain or defend why I like something. Sometimes I just like things and don't want to have to explain how I connect to every little fractional aspect of it. While she was not intentionally doing this, I constantly felt like she was yucking my yum.",

I have tried and the problem is the depression can be infectious. Trying to help someone at least in my experience was never ending. I say that to mean, we would have a good morning. He would open up and everything would be good. Then after the sun got high and the wind would blow, he would seclude himself in his depression for something else. Then we would talk about it and I would bring him out of it, it was emotionally exhausting and his depression began to affect mine. I'm not a therapist maybe what the westerners call an empath? I have had friends and family who strongly believe I'm an empath, but that does not make me a therapist.\n\nWeeb. I don't know if you consider online dating as a personable experience if you have never met the person face to face. I have entertained one person in a relationship. She was someone who was enthusiastic about Japanese culture. Being half Japanese from Japan that was an experience. Everything had to be explained and defined to the most minute level in meaning and cultural relevance. She had to be constantly corrected because of misconceptions. Which was confusing because as open as she was to learning she was also adamant in what it was she learned despite it being incorrect. The word \"traditional\" was used so often in context and situations it didn't need to be. It was interesting. Somewhere in the world is a girl from New York who has so many video messages, food pictures, and pictures of me in Kimono or Yukata it could make one's head spin.\n\nExtreme Gamers I have dated. I will try not to ever again, Their entire lives revolve around gaming. Their job, their hobby, their entire reason for being is all about gaming. Which becomes a problem when everything they want to do is game. If I'm calling them they're gaming which is bad because they're not paying attention to me. I would suggest calling them back but they want to stay on the phone. Only to then ignore me while I'm on the phone because they're gaming.  Dates are being pushed back because a new game is out. Suggestions of me going over to watch them play. I like my games in the same way that I like sun bathing or long walks. Enough to enjoy but not too much that it consumes my life.",

But he actually told me that the radio is enough and Pandora is one step above that, also just fine. And forget ever going to live shows, festivals,\u00a0 concerts. I think we went to one concert in 20 years? I believe it was The 5th Dimension.\u00a0 I thought they might die on stage. Lol.\u00a0\nMusic is just under where my children are in importance in my life. He pretty much could live without it. Not compatible.\u00a0 At all.",

Why do I have to keep track of their finances so I can prove they're also at fault instead of piling all the blame on me? It's always the same excuse, too, that they don't have money and are going through a hard time, so they need help. Which would be fair, yet they're spending their money on wants like clubbing, eating at expensive restaurants, and going on expensive trips, whereas I can't see my doctors and skip meals to save money. And when I run dangerously low on money and have to press harder about them paying their fair share, they always skip town.\n\nThey also have the audacity to go out of their way to try to make my life miserable when I have to resort to extreme measures to get my money back. Believe me, I tried to be reasonable, too, but they either (1) ignored it, (2) didn't want to hear it so they \"forgot\", or (3) truly started believing the lies they started about me and thought I deserved to be treated poorly.\n\nMake sure you have mature and responsible people in your life to keep your sanity! Heck, even keep that one loyal af friend who keeps their crazy in check unless given permission to go ham to fight for you (figuratively speaking! please don't end up in jail); we all need advocates sometimes.

Sure, I get lonely every now and then and wonder what it could be like with the right person until I remember there is no right person. Just a bunch of humans, each with their own complex issues, problems, annoying habits, etc, and there's no guarantee that it'll work out.  There's no such thing as forever. It just isn't worth the mental/ emotional strain to deal with another human. The only people I'm willing to invest in that way are my kids and myself.
