Destroying property of someone because the brand they own makes you mad is gross. Most of those people can't afford a new car right now or even just like the car for the car. No politics included. \n\nI was called a maga extremist, Nazi, trumper, and multiple other names while being downvoted en masse. Meanwhile people praising it and promoting destroying them and setting them on fire in a super creepy, psycho way were praised and up voted to the sky. \n\nPeople don't want discussion. They want echo reinforcement and if you aren't part of the hive mind you're attacked. Most people don't even engage anymore because they either get banned or trolled and downvoted to hell. The new one is to get called vile things then blocked so you can't say anything back.\n\nMany of the questions posed are exactly for that. They want to attack people that answer the way they don't like while patting each other on the back for getting the bad people that have a different opinion.",

It's always been left leaning but now you can't even disagree with someone left leaning without having hell brought down on you. No matter what side you're on. I've seen them attack each other if they don't agree on something.\n\nI usually stick to my interest pages and even then I've seen people injecting politics into it, whether cars or 3d printing. They look for any chance to attack lately. And viciously. \n\nMy local town page had 3 people recently banned for straight out saying they wanted the president to get killed or Republicans to get gunned down in the streets. Had one guy say he wished people started shooting Republicans and claiming self defense to get away with it because them and their families deserved to die.\n\nIt's getting absolutely horrific here but excused if you're on one side of it.",
