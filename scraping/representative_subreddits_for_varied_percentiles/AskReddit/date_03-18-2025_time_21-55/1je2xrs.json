But when I pointed out it is this administration that is enforcing the takedown he says it's still bullshit and shouldn't happen. When I ask if he would vote for the opposition in response he said no. He will always vote for Republicans.\n\n\nEdit at 722: obviously I don't know the red line is for this guy. He thinks musk is an idiot. And that we are getting close to his red line. If that helps.",

I know, because I listened in the late 80s, early 90s, and it had an impact on me, I regret to admit. At least 3 hours a day, 5 days a week, every week, every year, multiple times during the same show, over and over and over and over and over and over again. You get a song in your head because pop radio stations play certain songs over and over again. Beat it. We built this city. The Macarena. The same thing. Dems took it for granted. Never countermessaged. Just like they never ran for many local offices, leaving hundreds of elections unopposed for local and state Republicans to fill, until Run For Something realized, retroactively, the mistake.\n\n\nAnd then Fox came around and extended the relentless propaganda from 3 hours 5 days a week to 24 hours 7 days a week.\n\n\nNeed a lot more counter-messaging building on top of each other. Not just 2 layers of counter messaging, or 5. But dozens if not hundreds of layers to break the disinformation. I recall a cult expert mention that each hour of brainwashing requires at least an equal hour of deprogramming.",

It was about the economy, not social issues and certainly not protecting democracy.\n\nThis election wasn't lost because of voter apathy.  If every eligible voter voted, Trump likely would have won by more.  The election was lost because Americans from many demographics are increasingly right wing, because they get their news from social media.  Apathy existed, but the bigger impact was people switching from Biden to Trump.\n\nhttps://archive.ph/kbwom#selection-1685.13-1691.277\n\n> roughly 30 percent of the change in Democratic vote share from 2020 to 2024 was changes in who voted \u2014 changes in turnout. But the other 70 percent was people changing their mind. And that\u2019s in line with the breakdown we\u2019ve seen for most elections in the past 30 years.\n\n> ...\n\n\n> There were a lot of Democratic voters who were angry at their party last year. And they were mostly moderate and conservative Democrats angry about the cost of living and other issues. And even though they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for a Republican, a lot of them stayed home. But basically, their complaints were very similar to those of Biden voters who flipped to Trump.\n\n> The reality is if all registered voters had turned out, then Donald Trump would\u2019ve won the popular vote by 5 points [instead of 1.7 points]. So, I think that a \u201cwe need to turn up the temperature and mobilize everyone\u201d strategy would\u2019ve made things worse.\n\n> ...\n\n> The issue that voters cared the most about was overwhelmingly the cost of living. I really cannot stress how much people cared about the cost of living. If you ask what\u2019s more important, the cost of living or some other issue picked at random, people picked the cost of living 91 percent of the time. It\u2019s really hard to get 91 percent of people to click on anything in a survey.\n\n>After the cost of living, it was the size and scope of the federal government, the budget deficit, immigration, crime, and also health care. And people trusted Republicans on these issues by double-digits \u2014 except for health care, where we had a 2-point advantage, which was much lower than our traditional advantage on that issue.\n\n> ...\n\n> On the one hand, voters say they thought that the Democratic candidate was too liberal. But on the other hand, in our randomized control trials, the best testing advertisements were more compatible with progressive critiques of the Harris campaign. The single best testing ad by the Kamala Harris campaign was one where she looked directly into the camera and said something like, \u201cI know the cost of living is too high, and I\u2019m going to fix that by building more housing and taking on landlords who are charging too much.\u201d\n\n> And I think you can get into existential debates about what economic populism really is. But I think that the existing research really pointed clearly toward the idea that the electorate wanted economic change \u2014 and cared more about that than preserving America\u2019s institutions.\n\n\nThe problem is core to the American population.  I don't know how we can fix it.  Americans are less educated and less discerning than they've ever been, and we're headed towards a situation where massive unemployment and climate disasters will rock a huge portion of them, but because they're uneducated they trust Republicans more to help with issues like unemployment.\n\nWhen we talk about **willful** ignorance, this is it.  I don't know how you break through that.  They're not educated and if you try to educate sternly, they get upset that you're being condescending and if you try to educate delicately, they disagree on any point of nuance because to them nuance is weakness.",

Highly recommend.\n\nHere's a brief snippit:\n\"The Republic doesn\u2019t run on moonbeams and magic. It can\u2019t be all things to all people all of the time. The work of maintaining the republic is tedious and boring, if you\u2019re doing it right. Duty very often isn\u2019t glamourous or popular or even particularly inspiring, but that is what holds civilization together. Sometimes, most times, it\u2019s just about showing up and doing what has to be done to hold back the fall of night and for no other reason than because the alternative is disaster and ruin. It\u2019s your duty as a citizen to keep the nuts from working loose and the walls from falling down. You don\u2019t get a medal for that and nobody is going to sing songs about you, but it\u2019s your job nonetheless.\n\nDuty, very often, isn\u2019t even particularly moral. Mostly it\u2019s about doing the greatest good for the greatest number of people, most of the time.\"\n -Jim Wright, Stonekettle Station, Hunting the Unicorn -- to Extinction.",

That would require all pieces working perfectly in unison since the 60s, there\u2019s too much going on in the world for that to work for as long as it has. The reason why the left can\u2019t organize is because without a unified party they can\u2019t. The problem is in the past democrats and republicans weren\u2019t conservative vs liberal. It was small vs large government. After the democrats success with the Great Depression, WWII and civil rights movement, Republicans were on the fence, and as a result, changed their messaging to reach the isolated Dixiecrats. Then following that they scooped up the \u201cmoral majority\u201d which attracted the major voting block of evangelical Christians, which are a huge voting block. Suddenly their identity was conservative vs liberals. With the conservative block united under a single banner instead of split amongst democrats and republicans that\u2019s why it fails. Democrats end up being voted for because when things go wrong under republicans they can build messaging that is \u201cwe aren\u2019t republicans who screwed you over\u201d whether it\u2019s war related (Desert Storm, War in Iraq), disease related (AIDS, COVID), or economic crisis during the republican administration (the Great Recession). Without a reason for democrats to be \u201cwe aren\u2019t republicans\u201d, the party collapses under several minority blocks with differing opinions that struggle to mix and attract the moderates who have an open ear and don\u2019t vote permanently vote republican. \n\nI think that\u2019s why Kamala was trying to pivot to attract conservatives. It was a failed effort to rebalance the parties because moderates were angry at inflation and government seemed to not be doing enough and as a result, the strategy didn\u2019t work against populist messaging. \n\nThe Democrats need to pivot their strategy and fight back against aggressive messaging and sane washing ads. Trump is no longer elected yet his party is still pushing ads hailing his goals like we are still in an election cycle. That\u2019s hard to do currently because it\u2019s only a couple months into 4 years. The other part is they need to identify their up and coming leadership and solidify their support under a single representative who will be the future president and get them on the campaign trail as soon as possible. Get them out there and get them the monetary muscle to get as loud as Trump. Even if it means Trump starts threatening legal action, if he does, they are doing something right.",

And was only further stunted in US from the Red Scare onwards. Anything that isn\u2019t capitalism or conservative is dominated with fear mongering. Aren\u2019t into capitalism? You\u2019re a big scary communist or socialist (I say this with sarcasm). When the Democrats and Republicans had conservatives split between them inherently the left had more voice. A more conservative president or political representative still had to bend the knee to appeal to their more progressive constituents to guarantee their votes and therefore, position of power. Which again falls back to what I said above. The leveraging of pivoting the larger block conservative members of the US to lean hard Republican has stunted progressive growth in America because all that\u2019s left for America in the left is those who cannot properly come together as a proper party because their opinions don\u2019t more strongly align allowing a proper movement to form to be funded. No psyop necessary. Just not enough strength in numbers that can be unified properly because they neither have the funding or unified messaging to draw proper political weight in America. Keyword being funding. You still have to appeal to the ones willing to finance these movements. Or shatter the two parties into multiple smaller parties that have no choice but to link together limiting just how much money can be pumped in. Because that\u2019s the strength of the Republicans and Democrats, for better or worse. Ideally a stronger left independent party would help, but that independent party still would need to funding weight to advertise, campaign, and attract votes. Money (unfortunately) is power. No need for the CIA to get involved. Just currently the wealthy have no appetite to satisfy the needs of the masses. That won\u2019t change until the masses react in such a manner that the wealthy have no choice but to listen. Or as I said, the Democrats attract more of the current moderate conservative base their way and solidify a new block that balances things, making the left\u2019s voice again, stronger by default. Not the most ideal solution. But that\u2019s American politics.",

They may not even consciously realize it, but clearly they are looking to push misery on \"the other side\", and it's like it's a game at this point. They've lost the plot. Then you wrap a cult of personality around it and put someone on charge who REALLY pisses off the libs, and they're gone. It just feels too good to them to resist.\n\nI think they probably assume \"we\" worship Democrats and want them to be miserable too, and I think by and far that's miles from where \"we\" are generally speaking.

I may not entirely agree with the premise, but I can at least respect the consistency of the argument.\n\nConservatives, generally speaking, will acknowledge that there *was* a need for DEI immediately after the Civil Rights Act was passed because employers were generally reluctant to hire black workers, specifically. They would then typically argue that society has changed to such an extent that it\u2019s no longer necessary because everyone is judged on their merits now. This argument I cannot respect because it essentially implies that racism is \u201ccured.\u201d\n\nIt was the latter argument I was referring to in my comment. \n\nOn the topic of the Navajo code talkers, I simply don\u2019t see any way to justify this decision with any argument whatsoever.

I\u2019m seeing people questioning the qualifications of basically every person who isn\u2019t a straight white male and insisting that they must be DEI hires. And the government erasing groups of people seemingly *because* of their race or gender. It\u2019s gone beyond a reasonable discussion of whether DEI is good policy or not.",

Men being men they quickly \"found\" their own wives (or concubines, or slaves, it was frequently very very ugly), which quickly meant that everyone with power in the colonies was their mixed race descendents (except for, say, the governor, who might have come directly from Spain or France).  Fast forward a few hundred years and almost everyone is mixed race with a lot of \"colorism\", since being whiter and more European historically meant more money, status, power, education, etc.  \n\nThe English and the Dutch were trying to make money, but were also trying to fix an overpopulation problem, so they sent men *and* women, or even entire families, and lots of them.  And several of the places they colonized had fewer surviving natives - the USA/Canada region and Australia always had smaller native populations which were then decimated by diseases, and most of South Africa when the Dutch arrived had recently been conquered by the Zulus, killing huge numbers of people and leaving lots of land nearly empty.  Plus bigotry and puritanism.\n\nAnyway, that's still an oversimplification, and culture still played a big factor, but the primary reason places like Latin America are so much more \"mixed\" than the USA historically is because the colonies were set up very differently.",

We had almost 20k deaths and we consider that a national tragedy. We held at less than 100 before someone broke the rules and caused an outbreak.\n\nThe US however has over 1 million deaths. Ten times per capita compared to us, and it was so preventable. So unnecessary. Just because your lives don't matter to them. All the politicians who told you it's a hoax got vaccines as soon as it came out. They got top tier healthcare from professionals who took it seriously. They know. Yet they let people get themselves hurt or killed. People who trusted them.",

Their culture and ethnicity was gradually replaced over centuries until only a shadow of it remained.\n\nOnly a tiny sliver of Nahuatl speakers remain in Mexico and other formerly Aztec adjacent territories. Their culture was replaced by European colonists, even if they weren't ethnically replaced, their culture was all but eliminated.\n\nEven in Europe against other Europeans this has happened. If you look at the average Sami person they just look like a normal white person, yet the Norwegians spent centuries oppressing and forcibly assimilating them into their culture.\n\nAnd finally, in the case of Native groups in North America, you don't think they were just slaughtered do you? That certainly happened in droves of course, but the ones who survived further had their culture erased by the Dawes Act of 1887 which broke up the remaining tribal lands into privately owned territory and forced Native children to be educated into white culture.\n\nI'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're just historically illiterate instead of being a denialist. Just in case though, you think the Holocaust happened, right? Please say yes so I know I'm dealing with a normal human being.",

And this is a relatively new requirement, so many suppliers who we have had strong working relationships with for decades are struggling to meet it. And many of them are located in predominantly white rural areas so it is going to be incredibly difficult for them to meet diversity quotas because it's a bigger job than a single company can handle to make a small town seen as a desirable and safe destination for a minority to live. So these companies are losing huge business orders, and having to downsize their workforce because of something they didn't do wrong and can't control and I think they are 100% justified in being angry about that.\n\nAnd from my point of view I strongly dislike that suppliers who are better at the objective measurable part of their job (designing and manufacturing quality parts) are no longer able to work on my parts because they're not diverse enough. It means we deliver a worse product, we might lose sales, and then my job becomes at risk too.\n\nI'm not against all DEI, I like the idea of initiatives to get young women and minorities into STEM, but you have to acknowledge that some implementations of DEI are harmful and there are justifiable, understandable reasons to be angry at DEI.\n\nOr don't acknowledge it, I can't force you to understand someone else.",

DEI really started heavily entering the conservative lexicon when Kamala was the candidate and I saw my fair share of \u201cshe\u2019s just a DEI hire\u201d, or \u201cshe just sucked dick to become DA\u201d, along with \u201cwe don\u2019t want the White House smelling like curry.\u201d\n\nSince then we\u2019ve seen jumps to assume any person in a position of authority who is a non-white male is only there because of DEI policies. \n\nAnd I hope you would also extend the olive branch back and say that by doing wholesale sweeps of DEI which removes references to historical racial advances like originally referenced in this thread, the Tuskegee airmen and Navajo code talkers, is a horrible way to re-evaluate/change DEI policies. \n\nI have been on many hiring boards of companies with DEI policies, and even departments, and as someone else has said in another comment on this thread, those policies only went as far as some training to encourage hiring managers to consider all candidates and to introspect on their own personal biases. At no point in time, across hundreds of openings that I\u2019ve helped to fill, has there been any encouragement to hire one candidate over another based on something other than skills.",

However, literally every person has the same basic needs to survive. \n\nLet's just do a simple example of equity in action: the goal is to provide every person in the US with clean drinking water. There is not a single human being to have ever lived who did not need drinking water. Having that water be clean saves money and boosts productivity by preventing disease. \n\nHot Springs, VA, is not going to need the same water system as Phoenix, AZ. \n\nNot only is Hot Springs over lots of natural groundwater, but it is also tiny. The entire county has only 4,209 permanent residents, with the town itself sitting at under 750. It is in the heart of the temperate Appalachian rainforest. A system to deliver clean drinking water would be relatively inexpensive to build and maintain. Let's say the federal government grants Hot Springs $5 million to build and maintain their drinking water.\n\nPhoenix, AZ, has 1,662,607 permanent residents and is in a river valley in a desert. The water table is not particularly high. It costs a lot more to get every resident clean drinking water - let's say the government grants Phoenix $500 million to build and maintain their drinking water. \n\nIt is not *equal*, but it is *equitable.* \n\nIf Hot Springs started getting huffy that Phoenix was getting so much more money to get clean water, they would be acting irrationally. We would be able to understand that from a logical, practical point of view, they would be bellyaching over nothing. It would be outrageous for Hot Springs, VA to demand the same water treatment facilities as Phoenix, AZ. \n\nLikewise, if Phoenix started whining about how much money was being spent on snow plowing public roads in Hot Springs and demanded their own snow plow, we would also see this technical equality as being absurd. \n\nEquity is merely acknowledging that no one is starting from exactly the same place with exactly the same needs. \n\nIt is an attempt at fairness. \n\nNow, please ask yourself who is benefiting from you being staunchly against efforts to make life more fair.",

The reality is that people who are railing against DEI are either misinformed about what DEI, in no small part to the constant right-wing propaganda about it, or they are just using it as a thin veil over their racism.  \n\nI wanted to say that it\u2019s not an accident that they\u2019re whitewashing over history from the pre-civil rights era.  The controversy over wokeness and DEI has always been a Trojan horse for straight racism (calling even a trojan horse is giving too much credit; it\u2019s not very concealed).\n\nI wasn\u2019t even saying something that I thought the comment I was responding to would disagree with.  Quite the opposite.  I chalk it up to the fact that on the internet everyone assumes they\u2019re under attack and generous reads are non-existent.  I think we should all learn to accept a little more pedantry without getting so defensive.  Regardless of how clear your writing is, there will always be ambiguity on the internet, so maybe let\u2019s not jump to calling each other morons so quickly.",

Not accusing of reactionarily joining the fascists, I'm sure you're good homie, but that's kind of how that last sentence reads.  \"well if you're going to criticize every statement that I make, I might as well just give up on social justice\" is kind of what that sounds like and I think that's literally how it's gone for some people.  I get it to some degree.  Arguments can be annoying, but it is kind of laughable to lose your faith to that in the face of the other camp being literal nazis.  I have my own moments of seeing a gay person support Trump and wishing for them to get to the \"find out\" part of the \"fuck around,\" but at the end of the day we don't want discrimination regardless of how braindead or annoying a person of a given marginalized group is.  I hope the internet/social media as a whole can get through this period and be less divisive and toxic.  I'm trying to be better about not contributing to that toxicity.",

In fact, almost all of what they have done so far targets only ONE of the countless groups that these policies were intended to ensure equal treatment for. Race. Race is the group they are focused on and it is stunningly obvious. \n\nSo from now on, when anyone uses the acronym DEI, I am demanding they articulate which LAW they deem to be \"DEI\" and what specifically about that law they want changed, and how they would implement that change.\n\nThese people think they can just wave magic wands and things suddenly change for the better. The reality is many of these policies have significant downstream impacts when they are changed or removed and we have to be conscious of that fact so People are not actively harmed by doing so. An example is if our government is terminating \"DEI\" hires, and they terminate a doctor that is overseeing a medical study which has implanted medical devices in a number of real people (patients)...they need to be sure those patients are given properly alternative care and not just left in the lurch with no doctor to help them because a test device is in their body and no doctor outside of that trial in their right mind would mess with it.",

It was rich because he was saying this while currently having a good job that paid very well. He also entered the job market at a time when there were more attorneys than jobs for them. A lot of his classmates were struggling to find jobs, but apparently, since a woman got a job before him, he was being discriminated against. He mentioned that a woman with similar qualifications got a job he didn't. \n\nI asked him why he was so sure her being a woman was the deciding factor if they had similar qualifications. Maybe she just interviewed better. Or, maybe they were a firm that already had a lot of male attorneys and knew that having women on staff might make some clients more comfortable.",

Often restricting freedoms and occasionally equalizing them. \n\nIt's important because it was vital for understanding our past. Hell, coming to terms with racism is integral to our identity as Americans. \n\nIt's also important for understanding our present. #metoo and BLM didn't happen because bigotry wasn't affecting them.

There are companies like shareblue, now the american independent, who are hired by the DNC to do this kind of work.  It's not a secret, they normally present it as managing a counternarrative.  They used to announce these services when they were called correct the record.  Here's an 8 year old article  when this started:\n\n> Citing \u201clessons learned from online engagement with \u2018Bernie Bros,\u2019\u201d a pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC is pledging to spend $1 million to \u201cpush back against\u201d users on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Instagram.\n> [they have] \u201caddressed more than 5,000 people that have personally attacked Hillary Clinton on Twitter.\u201d\n\nSo it's not really that the DNC has some people working on this and typing messages, but it's companies that sell these service to the DNC.  These accounts are normally karma-farmed, and they then are bought by bulk on different services so they look legit.  Many times, they are just posting what other people posted.  You might have seen that some people accuse them of posting the same thing someone else posted, or they'll post the top reply from a previous post in that same post. \n\nThere's also people who manage hundreds of accounts that do this.  You can check OP's posts and see that no other post matches posting a question like this on a subreddit, and what's stranger is that a question that gets to the front page doesn't have a single comment from him.",

At some point in the last two decades, we stopped being curious about how \"the other side\" thinks, and chose to start ridiculing them, because it's far easier to dismiss what we'd rather not understand. Both the right and the left do this, and that's okay to admit.\n\nCongress is a place where people of differing ideologies should come together to forge productive, logical solutions to emerging issues through compromise, not engage in political tribalism. It's okay to be curious and ask questions about things you don't understand. I honestly recommend it. But if you just wave your hand and call \"the other side\" 'fascists' and 'Nazis', you kill that conversation before it even gets a chance to start.\n\nMost people on the left are not uber-progressives, in the same way that most people on the right are not fascist ultra-nationalists. In fact, I'd be willing to wager that the majority of Americans agree on virtually all issues in one way or another, but we've divided ourselves into opposing teams instead of the collaborative collective that it was always supposed to be.\n\nBe curious.

I get banned quite often as a result, but I messaged a non-supporter mod about it and they gave me what is quite possibly the most accurate way to handle that sub and even extends out to MAGA elsewhere.\n\nThis mod basically said to look at MAGA as though they were a tribe that has been cut off from the world. That non-supporters on the sub are basically doing a documentary with the strict policy that they aren't trying to convince them of anything or that they're wrong (unless directly asked to by a supporter). \n\nIf they believe that the sun is made of magical spirits that empower Trump to transcend time and space to save the universe, NS (non-supporters) are there to just learn more about it and NOTHING ELSE. And good lord are there a lot of insane and hypocritical views expressed there, with a sprinkle of slightly more grounded ones.\n\nThey're effectively viewed as the commodity because of how outnumbered they are on the platform, so even if they are in the wrong, the rules don't necessarily apply to them.

All the Mosely boys would muster in the Food Lion parking lot. They'd drive over to the high school in a convoy and stop in the parking lot bottle neck and play Dixie on a loud speaker and fly the Confederate flags high. Then our vice principal would pull them into the office and they'd whine about \"my free speech\" and \"it's my heritage, not hate\" and as soon as they thought nobody was listening they'd call her the n-word. They used to drive around off school property with little nooses hanging from their rear view mirrors. Fucking cowards. \n\nI'm still friends with a lot of these guys on Facebook. And yes they still regurgitate all the same racist bullshit that they used to. They haven't changed. They're deeply entrenched in their beliefs that their ancestors were somehow victims. And they are continuing to fight the fight. And they are continuing to fight the fight I know for a fact that a lot of them see Donald Trump and Project 2025 as the South rising again. \n\nIMO, I think The monuments down all monument avenue should be replaced with monuments to Oderus , the 1994 Richmond Braves, Tank Boy and Dirt Woman. Fuck what you heard.",

What you're talking about is what started out as the classical B-school \"diversity\" training, and the \"colorblind society\" thing that 90s kids grew up being inundated with. We are all different, different perspectives can result in better ideas, don't discriminate against someone just for being different, etc. That's what it's taught as academically, and that's what it's *supposed* to be, with a splash of \"be more aware of your own biases, including implicit bias.\"\n\nBut it's also a semi-formal \"thing\" in practice. Some places were hiding (illegal) racial \"quota\" type systems using \"DEI\" as a buzzword shield. I remember sitting in a hiring panel as an SME, having graded resumes for a first down-select, and one manager going \"there's still too many. We have too many men in this office, let's just throw out all the men and hire a woman.\" And the EEO office rep AGREED before the ultimate selection authority cut that off.\n\nThat's the kind of thing a lot of conservatives think of when they hear \"DEI.\" Being told they're the \"wrong color\" or \"wrong gender\" for a job (real unofficial feedback an acquaintance got after being passed over for promotion). Or worse, being afraid their *kid* will be told they're the \"wrong color\" or \"wrong gender.\" Sure, those aren't \"real\" DEI, but those kinds of things *do* happen at the individual level, and the Republican machine linked the term \"DEI\" with that sometimes-practice in the minds of voters. So now we have \"DEI\" that both is and isn't DEI.\n\nKind of like how \"Defund the Police\" simultaneously meant \"divert funding from police departments to social services because not every situation calls for a gun and handcuffs\" and \"no we really meant we want to abolish police departments across the nation\" depending on which advocate you were talking to. Or how \"CRT\" is both a graduate-level sociological framework for legal and historical analysis and a daily lens for viewing everything in a race conscious, intersectional way (which then seems to have morphed into \"woke\").\n\nIt's all kind of fascinating how all of this morphs from academia to (mis)implementation in the \"real ~~work~~*world*\" and down to talking points... or would be if it weren't having such disastrous results for society.\n\nEDIT: Fixed a word.",

Both my parents are vets and most of my family are too. My parents worked comms and my dad's  side of the family is Mexican-American (and iirc some technically native, but not registered).\n\nI know my dad talked about it being like an opportunity. Not great because it's based in exploitation, but most of my family holds the opinion that the military is exploitive by nature. You give your body and mind to the military, they use it, spit you out. \n\nSure you get your benefits, but at the cost of your body/mind potentially not working right for the rest of your life (or as one of my friends describes his experience \"the military is the reason I can't shit right anymore and have a habit of throwing up multiple times per week\").\n\nMost of my family has told a lot of us younger generations to never join the military unless you're desperate enough. They're proud of their service and other people who've served. But how their services get used/changed is what makes it hard to recommend people join. Plus there's plenty of other ways to serve your country.\n\nFor people of color (iirc Latinos were able to join the military before black people were), that wasn't always an option they had (to be able to join) or at least not with the same benefits/treatment/recognition.\n\nIirc the Navajo weren't initially recognized for their efforts. Being able to recognize efforts like that helps beat the push for things like heavily forced assimilation and the erasure of native cultures. More broadly, it helps us acknowledge that people can fight/work for their countries effectively in ways that differ from the dominant culture. It helps give more people opportunities. \n\nThat being said, DEI has its purposes. It's recognized for plenty of reasons.\n\nI personally don't think it's always implemented well or even pushes for diversity, equity, and inclusion very well (I've definitely questioned some motives in certain situations), but I still think it's important to recognize certain efforts and consider the differences to what that looks like in different time periods.\n\nTl;dr\n\nDEI isn't anything new and imo it's important to consider it as an actual concept rather than just another bureaucratic label.",

He argued in many letters to former soldiers that the war was over, and now it was time to forgive and move on to building a better country. At one point he chastised former soldiers for wearing their confederate uniforms in a parade.\n\nIn one letter he wrote the following:\n\n>I think it wiser not to keep open the sores of war, but to follow the example of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife, to commit to oblivion the feelings engendered.\n\nIf your goal is to convince modern day confederates to give up those beliefs, *you* are not going to convince them of anything, but a former leader that they venerate might.

Absolutely, there was some criminal behavior there. However it is near impossible to tell how good or bad it would have went had feds not been there riling things up AND had Pelosi approved those troops.\n\nSo on the one hand we have this odd occurrence that most certainly was bad but also has a lot of fishy details, and on the other we had literal riots all across the country when Trump won. Riots for days, burning effigies, stoning effigies, burning cop cars ALL OVER the country.\n\nTo paint these occurrences as even remotely equivalent is false, if not dishonest. And you throw it around casually as of they forgot it. Maybe, just maybe, they are tired of explaining to people such as yourself that these were not the same thing. And perhaps some of that energy on J6 was pent up frustration with insane riots against Trump 4 years earlier and the Floyd riots which were also largely anti-Trump riots that last months.\n\nI'm sorry, but the false equivalency is bullshit and you dropping it like that in such a passive aggressive way deserves a ban.",

The fact that so many use the 'inclusive' initiatives to cover up the prejudiced action that is hidden within 'equity' is why you are not getting buy in from conservatives on these action.  you are willfully turning a blind eye to other action and using the Diversity and Inclusion parts, which many conservatives actually fully agree with, to cover up for the truly racist actions that are purported to be the equity party.  \n\n  \nEx.  A company allowes all people to apply for the position,  but official hiring practices tell employees to be differential to minority, \"all other things being equal\"  tips the scales away from the majority population.  we can view that as beneficial,  it has been for me as a Hispanic through my career.  But looking back at those moments i can understand why the white conservatives are pissed off about it.  and these practices have been common. \n\nIE more simply. \"equal opportunity\" is letting all people apply, which is what equity purports to mean.  \" equal outcome\" is still deferring to preferred minority even with presumably 'equal skill' applicants.  what 'equity' looks like in practice.",

On the one hand they mostly celebrate Americans who implicitly or explicitly stood for slavery but I do think Robert E Lee was just fighting for his State because of a sense of Duty more so than wanting to keep up the institution of slavery. But on the other hand if you get rid of the statues you're removing not only history but kind of a warning to what you shouldn't let happen again.\n\nNow as for the Navajo code talker thing I like the Navajo code talkers it was one of the cool parts of history in World War II so when it comes to Trump signing orders about getting rid of Dei my question is were the code talker specifically targeted or was the wording of the order ambiguous enough to catch it in its Nets? Because I personally think that if Donald Trump knew that that particular part of History was being caught up and taken off the website that he would reverse it and allow it to be there but maybe I'm wrong. But on the plus side this is a famous enough part of history that even if Donald Trump did want to remove that part of history from the website then it would still be preserved websites whether they be sites about history on the Indians or World War II or even General facts/history websites like Wikipedia. My only anger issue would be if with the website being taken down it took down a primary or singular Source about the code talkers that could not be accessed anywhere else.",

Fuck yeah I love meth!\u201d\n\nHope that communicates my own feelings on the matter.\u00a0\n\nTLDR: i think pulling statues down and erasing history is generally not a great idea, but I can also appreciate how for many folks the symbols of the confederacy are quite negative and troubling. I also think Trump is a vicious, vindictive and generally crazy person and that his DEI nonsense (like so much else of his decrees) is not for the better.\u00a0",

I felt that attempts to do so were just knee-jerk reactions from out-of-touch people a thousand miles away that didn't know what sweet tea was and probably didn't wipe their feet before they entered the house, either. They were blowing everything way out of proportion, *right?* -- a bull in a china shop it had never even *seen* before but saw fit to wreck, anyway. Slavery, segregation, racism -- these were all battles we as a society fought over *decades* ago, and the good guys **won**, *decades* ago!\n\nSlavery was abolished, of course, and what a sad stain on human history that was!\n\nSegregation ended, thank goodness; I can't *believe* anyone thought that was a good idea, anyway.\n\nAnd of course, racism has fizzled out; all the white people saw all the pain of black people and other minorities, realized the cruelty and injustice inflicted, recognized the moral arc of the universe and the trend towards greater and more universal freedom and the accompanying futility of their intolerance, and all feel *really* bad about all what happened and we're all so happy society doesn't believe in those bad things anymore!\n\nSo, ***of course*** those monuments aren't actually *celebrating* confederate soldiers or slavery and racism as a practice -- ***after all, no one actually believes in those things anymore!*** Therefore, the *only* conceivable purpose of the monuments is as a candid acknowledgement of **History**, of the mistakes of the past. Surely it's obvious we maintain these monuments as a solemn expression of virtue, of dedication to never forgetting the lows we as people were capable of! Yankees don't seem to realize it, but this is how we wear our scars on our face, so no one can claim it didn't happen, and by making sure the past isn't forgotten, we also educate our youth and protect our future! You'd actually be making racism (which pretty much died out in the 60s) *worse* by getting rid of them!\n\nThat's what I thought, anyway...\n\nbut I was also a hopelessly idealistic, naive white youngin who grew up with his home as the butt of every joke -- who grew up in a sheltered liberal home in a white neighborhood and never heard anyone say anything racist to **any** of the black people who weren't there, and just couldn't believe anyone could think anyone actually still believed that racism stuff anymore, and won't they just leave us alone and go back to mispronouncing \"pecan\" and eating that weird crappy wheat gruel that's like grits if grits were also 100x worse?\n\nOf course, as time went on and Harambe came ever closer to becoming a meme, I saw greater evidence that, actually, some people ARE still racist peices of shit and, actually, A LOT of people are still racist pieces of shit and wait no they *actually* think the confederacy were the good guys?  Some become cops and literally step on black people's necks and other people don't just *stop* them? This guy actually thinks Obama is from Kenya? He's not just saying that to be mean?\n\nSo yeah. It was enlightening to see the rot spread out of from behind the wallpaper, and sobering to realize how much I'd hung on that wallpaper without realizing what was festering behind it all this time. If I'd had less support from thoughtful minds growing up, it's not impossible to think I might've joined that rot, earnestly believing I was in the right. I'm not a conservative now and never have considered myself one, but I'll state that obviously stripping service awards from anyone for any reason besides gross criminality is a disgrace to the service, the person, and the award, and all those else who have ever received that award.",

Should we praise traitors who supported slavery in the face of the rest of the nation? No. If anything, I maybe support changing the plaques associated with them to teach about the sad and disgusting history that followed those figures rather than destroy them. Destroying historical structures of statues is a good way to put them out of sight and out of mind, which is a great way to forget that it happened, which serves no other purpose than to have history eventually repeat itself. Instead I am more of a proponent of turning it into a historical lesson, and I'd encourage the cities and recreational departments to  allow to surround the structures with donated sculptures that represent the unity of our country as a better place after defeating the confederates. Plaques, murals, sculptures, etc., as it would also to help portray the fact that the Confederacy was a dark time in US history, and the good that comes out of triumph and unity working together to build a better country from our mistakes.\n\nFinally, I have issues with associating the Navajo code talkers as diversity hires. They absolutely were not. I do however oppose some of the practices and ideas behind DEI style policies. People regardless of race creed and color should have an equal opportunity in the US; full stop, no ifs, ands, or buts. However it's a delicate balance between how do you contain and limit the powers of prejudice without forcing and fool-hardily embracing hiring people solely out of the essentially exact same prejudiced logic. Your race, gender, sexual preferences, religious views, and political opinions should bear no difference on your conduct or career as a civil servant, nor should they be discussed or displayed on government property. As an actual advocate of the separation of church and state, the same theory should apply to many facets of life as they are decisions made by each individual according to their own life experience, and therefore should not be represented through your workplace and job. We are all individuals we all have different lives, and we all have different opinions: the best way to represent that is with an open and vast landscape of unity despite diversity instead of individual diversity being represented over unconditional unity.",

Especially middle to lower class White men. \n\nThe focal point of this resentment stems from preferential treatment of POC/Women in college admissions. Middle Class white men are getting discriminated against and denied admissions or scholarships despite having higher scores and better extracurricular activities. Rich white men of course benefit from unearned legacy admissions but this is unfairly used to say that all white men have an unfair advantage. Us poor ones don\u2019t get that same benefit. \n\nHowever, other areas where DEI has a discriminatory effect are in large corporations (Anheuser-Busch is a great example: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/opinion/anheuser-busch-dylan-mulvaney.html) and state and local governments where POC are generally allowed to slide by with less competency so as to increase representation; whereas white men are held to the highest standard.\n\nHowever, in cases where POC have made significant contributions to the USA, such as the Navajo Windtalkers, it is appropriate to celebrate the accomplishment and point out their ethnicity while doing so. It\u2019s not really DEI to recognize these groups since their spectacular contributions speak for themselves and would be celebrated regardless of their race .\n\nRemoving mention of these accomplishments is just mean, petty, and racist.

The statues were built to acknowledge how those leaders fought their battles not based on their skin color, sex and etc. Though the guidance left a little room for interpretation on what is to be removed, it did say things should only be deleted if the posts were soley based on the DEI characteristics. Actual history isnt being deleted as there are many sites/books and endless mediums that is appropriate for that content. The Navajo is an example of a casualty in this mass purge. They helped the US in a tremendous way, but a government employee seen the guidance, had less than a week to comply so they archived it and deleted it. (Still subject to FOIA requests). Their language/culture was key and some webmaster didnt want to spend time to think if it fit inside of the guidances exceptions. However, the history and museums are still there.
