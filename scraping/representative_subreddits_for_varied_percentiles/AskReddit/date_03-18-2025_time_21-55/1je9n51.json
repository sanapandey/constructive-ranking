Turned out a rich influencer is now on her side, flying through Europe and having a good time while I\u2019m still at her house, mentally absolutely broken and can\u2019t move out because of finances. \n\nThere will be better times and better people in my life. I trust in that.",

I often tell myself, \"These times, good or bad, will pass.\" and it's kept me going more than I thought it would, its similar to what you said. I promise you, keep going, it gets so much better. If you thought you were happy with her, imagine a woman who is fully dedicated to you, someone who can't be swayed by hedonistic things like money and traveling. Anyone with half a brain cell can see that if you were able to keep her for 6 years but she suddenly runs into the arms of some rich influencer, you weren't the problem. \n\nGrief will have its own pace, let it wash over you and take as much time as you need, I said grief because you'll have to mourn her loss - she's not the person you fell in love with. That girl is gone, good as dead. Sort out your belongings, make sure she can't take any of your stuff away from you and contact anyone you know, parents/friends to move out of that place. Is there anyone like that right now, who you can crash with?\n\nI'm sorry I can't give any more advice other than talk to anyone you trust and see what you can do, and I mean ANYONE. You'll be surprised at who might end up being useful. Stay strong and don't do anything rash. If you need to just talk, DM me i won't ignore your message",

Partied on off nights, same taste in music and went to shows together yadda yadda yadda.   \n\nThat\u2019s the setup.\n\nSo I started dating some young woman who happened to be a regular at the bar (this accounts for I\u2019d estimate 98% of where bartenders meet their romantic partners).   We date for a while, she has some roommate issues and I say, \u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of room at this house, why not just move in with me?\u201d  \n\n\nSo she does.    Shortly after she moves in, I find out that she lost her job, had no money, and no intention of getting a job, and no intention of contributing to rent or bills.     \n\n\nWe have an argument at home one night about money and she leaves.      Shows back up the next morning and we talk it out.  She agrees to look for a job and help out even a little bit.  \n\n\nThings go well for awhile.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nMonths later I learn through the grapevine from a coworker who\u2019s also a friend that the night GF and I had the housing arrangement fight, she went to the bar where I worked, got fucked up with my best friend-coworker-boss and they had sex in the office.   \u2026Where I have to go to work over and over again.   \n\n\n\nLost a friend, a girlfriend, housemate, and eventually job over that one.    \n\n\nWent through a rough patch emotionally for a while, but I\u2019m happily married and out of the restaurant biz and both of these aspects of my life make my mental health *ssssooooooo* much better than I\u2019d even imagined back then.    \n\n\nBut yeah that the worst thing an ex had done to me.

The last thing I said to her was to never contact me or come near me or my dog ever again because I had her email admitting to breaking into my house, stealing my dog and threatening to hurt her, and at this point I was willing to get lawyers and the police involved.\n\nNow, an ex kidnapping your dog and threatening violence in order to manipulate you into whatever they want you to do is batshit crazy by itself, but the thing that really pissed me off is that we were together for about eight years and she was my GF when I adopted my dog back when she was a puppy several years before, so my dog absolutely loved her and saw her as her other owner.\n\nI honestly don't know if she was just bluffing or if she would've hurt my dog if I hadn't immediately gone to get her back, but that shit was psychotic anyway. Thankfully it's been years now and that dog lived to be a venerable 15 years old before finally passing away in my arms after a full life, and I never saw that crazy ex again.",

We\u2019ve been doing that without issue for about three years now. \n\nI think we would both absolutely prefer never dealing with each other, but despite everything that has happened between us, we both acknowledge that the other loves and needs the dogs. \n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine taking them from him, and I know the feeling is mutual on his end. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your situation.",

Maybe meeting her was God's way of changing you for the better. Just for your own benefit. In the end it just didn't work out I guess. You would think she would have been happy with you making those changes for her and appreciate the effort that you put into doing that. I smoke weed too. So I mean I see why she would do that. It's calming essentially. Were you not willing to smoke weed with her? Or did she even try to smoke with you and engage with you that way?",

If I tried to end off the relationship, he would threaten the same thing. He would pressure me a lot into having phone sex with him. For example, I get on a call if I'm thinking that we're going to have a normal talk, and he shows me a picture of his dick immediately as we start the conversation. He would often lead the conversation in sexual areas. I didn't always feel comfortable with that, but if I said no he was going to threaten to hurt himself.\n\nA lot of my friends have told me that I was being dick to him and that I should have been more accepting of this. Please remember that this was a high school relationship. I don't think I would have been compatible even if I was as accepting we didn't share a lot of interest with each other besides liking to text. so, if you can, let's frame it out of who is the bigger dick, and more of compatibility. I didn't like what he liked, so we're not compatible.",

I had an opiate addiction, my girlfriend was supplying me, and we would both be horrible to each other. One night we got in a fight, shouting back and forth. She slapped me across the face, hard. I grabbed her by the throat and threw her against the wall and told her that if she ever raised her hand to me again, I would raise one back.\n\nIn that moment, I was seeing red, angry, but as soon as I let go of her, I wanted to cry. I felt embarrassed and ashamed of what I had done and said. I knew that it wasn't who I really was, but while fucked up on drugs and in a fight, I had the potential to actually harm someone that I claimed to love.\n\nThis was the breaking point for me. I kicked all the drugs. I broke up with her. She moved out and I started rebuilding my life. It took a while before I was comfortable enough with myself to date again. I don't tell everyone that I've dated since about that night, because I don't believe that's who I really am. I've never had an episode like that since.\n\nEveryone has the potential to be violent in the right situations. Since I know what situation did it to me, I've made sure to never be in that situation again. Haven't touched anything harder than alcohol since, and even that has been just a social drink here and there.\n\nBy the way, it's not her fault that I reacted like I did. It's her fault that she slapped me, but everything after that is on me. Honestly I think I fault her more for keeping me high all the time.",

Instead of talking, she just told me she was moving back in, wouldn't contribute at all, then called the cops and said I abused her. Cops arrive, they don't buy it, but later that evening, her own cousin calls me. He says she told them her evil plan, to go to the court in the morning and get a TRO against me, so she would get the house and I'd just be fucked. Her cousin is an alright dude. Saw it was wrong, and reached out. I ended up getting one against her, which she repeatedly violated. Of course, she is a female, so despite video evidence of her sneaking back into the house, they didn't arrest her. Reverse that situation in your mind, and ask yourself, would a man be arrested for the same thing?",

I\u2019m talking bi-polar, gaslighting, physical assault, threats of rape, family attacks, and many other things besides. She was abused as a toddler by her stepfather to a degree that was pretty unimaginable. I know this to be true because court cases were still ongoing with it well into her teens and I drove her to a few of them with her mom. That isn\u2019t an attempt to explain away the other stuff, it\u2019s simply a fact. Now onto the fun stuff\u2026\n\nWe weren\u2019t even actually breaking up. She got into a fit of paranoia, convinced I would leave her. Her bio dad had recently come back into her life and was trying very hard to make her his \u201cprincess\u201d\u2026 She being the manipulative type recognized the opportunity to use him as a tool to control me and others. Dad would make pretty hard threats to her friends she had disagreements with, and as a rule he hated my guts. Well one day we have a fight, the paranoia comes out in force and she breaks down into a fit of screaming tears, and says that she thinks I\u2019m trying to leave her etc. I try to calm her down but it isn\u2019t working so I say I\u2019ll talk to her later and leave.\n\nShe calls me a half hour later in a shaky voice, saying something has come up and I need to get to her house. I go over and her father slams the door shut after I walk in and is saying things like he\u2019s going to \u201ckill me for what I did to his daughter\u201d. \n\nSo at this point I should make clear two things: 1. Her father was massive. Had a bit of a gut but was working an oil rig, so he wasn\u2019t a small guy. I was about 16.\n2. I had bought a handgun a couple of weeks prior to this\u2026 I know, not smart, illegal in fact. But I thought I was cool and would keep it on me for \u201csafety\u201d.\n\nWell safety kicked in. I was utterly convinced he would in fact kill me. So I draw on him, and he gets more mad. But I make it clear that if he steps any closer I would empty the mag on him. And I would have. I was legitimately terrified I was going to die. I work my way to the door and leave. I blocked her number, deleted her off my socials, and made a concerted effort to never speak to her again.\n\nI found out after that she had told her dad that I had raped her and she was pregnant. The classic here being a shotgun wedding scenario. He went off script I guess with the death threats. Naturally she tried to tell everyone that I had assaulted her, police were called and everything. Well pretty much all her friends she alienated came to bat and said it was very likely all fabricated based on her attitude to them and falsified reports on record from the past. \n\nSome years later she sends me pictures of a boy she claims was my son. Kid is a spitting image of my HS friend Allan.",

Came to a complete stop in the middle of the road and you know what he does... he snatches my keys out the ignition turning the car off ( I drive a stick shift. So to my surprise, the keys just came right out because I was in neutral) and he got out of the car and ran away. I couldn't run after him he was way to fast all I could do was scream his name. And he pushed the lock button as he was running. Locking the car so when I got out to scream at him my alarm went off. So I'm stuck in the middle of the road and my alarm is going off and I can't shut it off or start the car to move it. The cops came and I had to tow my car to my house because my spare key was at my house and the officer wanted the car out of the road right away. The whole time my car was on the tow truck the alarm was going off. It never shut off!  I could tell the two truck driver was irritated and my neighbors probably hated me cuz it was 1 am and my car was blasting until I finally googled how to shut the alarm off with out a key fob. Turn the key back and forth in the ignition 3 times and it finally shut off. The tow was $200 bucks. And my ex came walking in a couple hours later. I was like where are my keys. He left them behind a Taco Bell dumpster down the road. He ditched them there. Luckily I drove down and got them right away. \nBut ya. He was an \ud83c\udf51\ud83d\udd73\ufe0f...",

I found out by a drunk phone call from him telling me everything. I ended things with him, and he didn't really care since he was focused on her. Eventually, he started reaching out to me to see how I was. I was actually doing very well and focusing on myself, but he was very depressed and still with that girl. 3.5 months after we broke up, I got a call from him at 1 a.m., which I ignored. An hour later, he sent me a message that his girlfriend broke up with him, and he was saying goodbye to me. Immediately, I tried calling him, and he wasn't picking up, so I got worried. Finally, he answered, and he told me he took a bunch of pills and told me to come be with him in his last moments. I couldn't believe what I was hearing, so I told him I was going to call an ambulance. He told me he would only go if I came to him. I was so worried, so I drove to his house and when I got there he was lying on the ground. He was choking in his own vomit, so I quickly tried to turn him over and called 911. I began doing chest compressions on him and was told to continue doing it until paramedics arrived. Before they got there, I could see his lips, ears, and fingers start turning blue. After 9 minutes, paramedics arrived and took over and pronounced him dead. I went home and went to sleep for 2 days straight. After that, I was in a very numb and dissociative state and didn't know how to feel for a year. It's now been 1.5 years, and I'm finally starting to feel like myself again. Besides the fact that I still haven't dealt with any of the trauma from everything he put me through.",

After serious discussions and what not, he (26M) said that more than anything he wanted us to be together, he loved me so much, etc, so he agreed to move with me when the time came. About 4 years into the relationship I ended up moving abroad, we did long distance for about 4 months and then he also moved with me, having quit his job, and we started our life in the new country. He had a job, he was learning the language and never once hinted or showed that he was unhappy. All his actions, everything he was saying to me about our future only made me more secure in what we had. We spent the whole summer of 2024 travelling together, seeing a bunch of places and I ended up spending the last 2 weeks or so of September in our home country, while he was at home, cause he had to work. I came back just a few days before the start of the new semester, and this is when he sat me down and told me that our futures are too different and he s not really happy here and he s decided to go back home, even though he loves me so much and this is so hard for him. But it s not just the fact that he wasn t happy here, which I would have taken it completely different. He had a job lined up and waiting for him starting in about 2 weeks, about which he knew for months, approximately from the month of May, so almost half a year before. He lied to me for months, he planned our whole summer together, told me he loved me above and beyond and let me dream and talk about our future travels together/kids. He basically kept the relationship going just because he wanted us to have \"one last unforgettable summer\", as he called it. He didn t once think to be honest with me, he just led me on like I meant nothing. I never thought he could betray me like that, never in my life.",

I sat with the fact that my wife was cheating till she confronted me about my changing behavior. Once everything was out in the open I took her back trying to keep my family from falling apart but she kept on cheating, this process continued 3 more times until I found out about the mistreatment of my daughter including the melatonin and Benadryl but also taking her to random men\u2019s houses where heavy drinking, sex, and physical abuse was happening. At that point I fled to a family members house and took my daughter with me. My wife then turned to threatening suicide, drinking and driving, breaking things in our house including our daughters, and getting the men she was sleeping with to attempt to kill me",

I have adhd so nope it wasn't they were picking up my car since it was 3 months late. I had been giving him money thru student loans etc. That is why my student loans are so high. He basically utterly ruined me financially. Left it all on me. \n\nI had the power shut off, water shut off multiple times. Landlord always banging on my door scaring me and the kids. Multiple times. He never even tried to fix anything so it would get worse. Tiny pinhole leak in pioe ruined floor. Walked on soggy wet moldy carpet for a year before I could get him to do anything. He refused to call a service or anyone. Made excuses. ROOF CAVED IN. Small fix. Had to let trailer go to demo. \n\nHe was able to buy a home. My sons wanted to live with him since he never gave them bedtimes or asked anything of them. He never even checked to make sure my oldest son was brushing his teeth. They rotted out and I had to pay a lot and he still needs more work. He is always gone and never home. I can't get my sons to hang out since they're comfortable there and like me set on their routines even if it is just gaming. \n\nI am not giving up on my kids or doing the resentment thing, just some times it eats at me. Especially now.",
