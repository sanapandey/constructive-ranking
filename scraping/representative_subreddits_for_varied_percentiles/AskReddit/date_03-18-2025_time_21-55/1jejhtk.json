Plus, her drinking. Judy Greer played the secretary. The stair car is seen at least a couple times. David Cross' character is sort of a pirate in both shows. I'm sure there are other examples I'm missing. I definitely suggest watching the original 3 seasons of Arrested Development and watching Archer afterwards.",

The Warner classics were definitely aimed at a more broad audience with some jokes that were clearly more for the adults in the theater, but even back in the 30s and 40s studio's saw that children gravitated more toward animation and they steered production accordingly.",

I worked ad mcDonald's at the time and while the training video wasn't exactly what we watched I recall it had a similar style to it. I've seen other training videos since then and most of them remind me of that episode. \n\n  \nI have the first 100 episodes on DVD and it was one of the reasons I made sure I had a multiregion DVD player, it's not the first non-region 2 DVD set I have but it was the one where I realised I had quite a few.

            "body": "If The Simpsons had ended somewhere around seasons 9 to 11, it would still be the unrivaled GOAT. The fact that there are 20+ seasons after that diminishes it somewhat.\n\nSo let me instead say Bojack Horseman.\n\nIt somehow manages to pair zany pure sillyness with brilliant character study for side splitting humor and gut punching emotional realism. It makes full use of the medium of animation to do things that a live action show just never could while consistently delivering incredible writing and performances from the cast. And unlike so many other cartoons, it tells a complete story over which the characters grow and change and wraps up perfectly.",
