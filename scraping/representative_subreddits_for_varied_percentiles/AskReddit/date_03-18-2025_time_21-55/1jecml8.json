He does not come from a cuddly family but saw that lots of touch was important to me and made efforts accordingly. I really hope your partner sees what she's got and reciprocates your efforts.

I can already feel the stress and depression leaving my body. I think I just needed a break because I've been in a depression for around 4-5 months and it's been exhausting. As soon as I submitted my final actual assignment, it felt like all the stress was lifted off my shoulders. I don't even really care about this final-- I just need to take it. I'll probably get an average grade, and if I show up and answer the questions I'll pass the class lol it's so freeing",
