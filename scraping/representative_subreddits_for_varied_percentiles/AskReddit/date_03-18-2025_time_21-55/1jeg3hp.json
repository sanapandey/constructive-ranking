That all changed one day, because a new policy came out saying you could not force a violent dementia patient to take medication. I guess the patient had to either want it, and/or the family member legally in charge of their medical care had to give their OK to do it. I am not sure if it was a new federal, state, or just a local facility policy. She said it made her terrified to deal with some of those patients after that was implemented. I am just curious, if you DO have a physically violent dementia patient, what the heck can you actually do about it? Can they be force-medicated, and if not because of some policy, can they be force-restrained or locked inside their patient room? I know they are innocent because they don't have the mental capacity to understand they are doing something wrong, but really, how do you handle this stuff???",

The agencies will cost $36-$56/hr depending on designation needed ie. PSW , RN , RPN etc. And the psw through an agency will actually only be getting $25-$30/hr ..that's also plus tax \n\nThe wages have increased because of covid and gross understaffing . I think in the nursing homes and dementia wards they certainly deserve $30+/hr but from my own experiences , the PSWS in the homes have no passion or bed side manner . It's rare to find one that goes above and beyond and loves her job and there comes some entitlement from personal support workers who think they should be making what an RPN starts at . It's a slap in the face to anyone that's went to nursing school .",

Yet I have personal friends who are nurses that have literally saved lives and earn less than \u00a330,000. \n\nDoctors *can* earn a good wage once they are qualified but have a look into what goes towards getting that qualification first: literal decades of study (which you will continue through your career to maintain your job) working ridiculous hours in one of the highest stress environments there is outside of war zones and barely earning more than someone stacking shelves in a supermarket. \n\nBesides all of that, just because some can doesn\u2019t mean that all of them do. The level of pay reflecting what is deserved over just being \u2018good\u2019 is another conversation entirely. The level of emotional and physical stress that comes with the job, along with the workload presented by understaffing, poor management and the fact that, as previously mentioned, you don\u2019t ever really finish studying with medicine, you are always expected to be on top form as a single mistake can end your career or more importantly someone\u2019s life. The responsibility and stress are more reasons to rethink what the right wage for them is. I have a 70 year old family member who is still going to university because areas of his field are always being updated and he needs to know them, none of which is paid for and all of which is done on top of his current role. \n\nA \u2018good\u2019 wage doesn\u2019t reflect what you deserve. Influencers and football players earn millions yet we expect people to want to devote their lives to dealing with some of the hardest parts of being human for less than \u00a330,000 a year? \n\nAnd all of these points are without even mentioning the ones who arguably got the shortest end of the stick: the care industry. Carers are beyond taken the piss out of between pay, hours and the stress that comes with simply caring for people you can\u2019t heal. You can learn to be a doctor, you can learn to be a nurse. You cannot teach someone who doesn\u2019t care about other human beings wellbeing how to do that. You can try, but they will never be as good as someone with genuine heart behind what they\u2019re doing. Carers are born, not taught. They have to deal with us all at our worst and most vulnerable while still managing to make it all seem like it will be okay even when it obviously won\u2019t. \n\nThey are not paid enough.

Our salary is a daily wage multiplied by the number of days worked divided by 12.  So our 9 month salary is divided up over 12 months. \n\nSummer school, for me at least, pays $35 an hour and they cap you at 6 hours a day for 4 days a week for 2 weeks in the summer.  So It almost covers daycare costs for 2 kids >.<.\n\nInternet stats are nice but most don\u2019t take into account the cost of living in the area or a combined family income.  Not many single teachers or double teacher families are represented.  My admin said it\u2019s a \u201ctrophy wife\u201d field when I asked for options when my property taxes increased more than my paycheck for the 3rd year in a row.\n\nI\u2019d take 85k for a year\u2019s work over 64k for 9months in a heartbeat.  But it will never happen.  \n\nPart that stinks is there are actually \u201ctiers\u201d of teachers now.  Older teachers are grandfathered in and are able to double retire before they even turn 60.  Generating much more in retirement and pensions.  While newer teachers are doing the same or more work, earning less retirement, and can\u2019t retire until 62-65.  So while some are living comfy as their kids have left school\u2026 newer teachers can\u2019t even afford a mortgage where they work and have to get less to make up for the older people getting more\u2026 let alone start a family and pay for childcare.\n\nWe are losing more teachers each year and half the new teachers quit.  Almost all of it is compensation.  \n\nVacation time is nice but doesn\u2019t mean much without the ability to generate savings to pay for them.  Even worse when we look at the states that are pulling back retirement so those teachers who have done the work, stuck with it, won awards, changed life\u2019s\u2026. Will not be able to financially take care of themselves after retirement.  \n\nIt\u2019s all just so difficult though.  Do you pay by performance?  Who gets the honors classes vs the special ed?  Does someone with honors get paid for better test scores?  Does a special Ed teacher get paid more for individual lessons for each kid?  Will teachers cheat if their pay is on the line?  Will standardized tests cost the state more to focus on justifying that pay?  Do teachers with 12 media design students get paid less than a teacher with 31 low skilled math students?    It\u2019s a mess.  It\u2019s gonna get worse with the push for private companies.  \n\nJust strange that people wont cut corners with so many aspects in their lives\u2026 cars, shoes, food, computers, phones, vacations, ect.  But for some reason\u2026 education of our youth is always seen as a minimum exchange.  Maybe because people don\u2019t have kids?  Maybe cus their kids have left school or arnt in school yet?  Maybe it\u2019s resentment because they feel they didn\u2019t get a good education experience so why should the new generations get it better?  /shrug\n\nADD meds are wearing off and I\u2019m sorry you got this wall of text.  Had give up my conference today to teach a class for a teacher who left.  Decided to start typing after my 9 hour work day with 1 25min lunch instead of grading my 92 quizzes.  Stupid move now that I think about it.  \n\nLol.  Tired.  And only 2 days back from spring break.",
