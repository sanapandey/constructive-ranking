Keep that image in your mind as long as possible, adding details as they talk.\u00a0\n\n\nChances are that your picture will be incomplete. Once they're done talking, try to see if you can piece together the whole picture with what you have. You can ask questions to fill in the details.

And most events have some degree of wiggle room around the scheduled time, with the amount depending on the event. For instance:\n\nA trip to the cinema: Showing up 10 minutes early will harm nobody, whilst being 10 minutes late could cause people to miss the start of the movie. So schedule your arrival 10 minutes early.\n\nA party/casual gathering at a friend's home: Showing up 10 minutes early could interrupt their preparation or putting their kids to sleep. Meanwhile, nobody will be significantly negatively affected if you're as much as 30 minutes late. So schedule your arrival to be on time.\n\nOf course, in either scenario nobody expects everyone to arrive simultaneously with perfect choreography. There is always a little wiggle room around the agreed time. For an appointment, that may be only 10 seconds late but 30 minutes early. For a completely casual get together, the agreed time may merely be an arbitrary suggestion based around expected convenience.\n\nIn either case though, it's generally polite to tell people you're going to be late as soon as you know lateness is inevitable. (Note: it being a consistent pattern of behaviour doesn't qualify, don't tell people you'll be late before even hearing what time you should be there.)",

It is possible to break down exam preparation in this way as well. When preparing for an exam by taking a practice exam, not only does one have to follow a time constraint, they have to dedicate their attention to processing the information on the exam and applying relevant knowledge to answer the exam questions.\n\nCan it be reasonable to say that by practicing attention management and time management, an individual can develop habits conducive to learning rigorous material, such as graduate level courses in mathematics and physics?",

I think it's going to take like two hours, but it only takes twenty minutes.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, oftentimes it ends up taking more time. I'm a terrible procrastinator. Part of it is being overwhelmed by this project I have to to; I can't break things down into smaller steps easily. Another part is that it doesn't have to be done *now*, so I don't feel like I need to do it now.\u00a0\n\n\nLike doing the dishes, first I have to stare at the pile of dishes for ten minutes. I can't figure out how to get started. When I do manage to get started, I'm constantly staring at the dishes throughout doing them to figure out what my next step is. Which dish do I do next? Is it small or big? How dirty is it? What kind of dirt is it? How much work will I need to put into cleaning it versus another dish?\u00a0\n\n\nSo while doing the dishes takes half an hour for some people, for me it absolutely does take two hours.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd then someone asks me to turn off my music and all the work I've done to isolate and prioritize information is gone. All I see is a huge mass of stuff and I get overwhelmed again. And now it will take over two hours.\u00a0\n\n\nIsn't ADHD fun?\u00a0",

I'm just pointing out that everything is taught, intentionally or not. \n\nI watch a financial audit show and the vast majority of people on that show just don't understand the gravity of the situation and how bad their finances are.\n\nMost bring up how their parents have similar finances - its normalized for them. Budgeting and saving feels unnecessary since they could just get another credit card and pay it off slowly like their parents/peers do. There's no concept of delayed gratification or just being unable to afford something because there is ALWAYS a \"pay later\" option. \n\nThey compare themselves to their families and peers: they see what others have, estimate their financial status, and gauge what they think they should have based on that. From cars to vacations to eating out to day to day spending.\n\nIf everyone has some form of car/credit card debt around you then why would you think anything has to change? It's the same thing over and over on this show: in their minds they are paying all their bills (paying minimums, getting personal loans and/or paying late) and they are still able to take out loans/new credit cards and no one is banging down their door repo-ing their stuff, so how bad could it be?\n\nIt really should be mandatory in schools to teach basic personal finances, even if you choose the university math courses. Yes it SHOULD be on the parents but it's an essential life skill that shouldn't be skipped. Kids need to be scared early into not abusing credit cards. They need to understand what interest is on the most practical level: an upcharge on every single purchase you make. How to budget, how to plan and save for a big purchase, how to average out your pay due to hourly fluctuations, etc.",

Nothing you've described changes from an education class. These are behavioral issues, not knowledge ones.\n\n> How to budget, how to plan and save for a big purchase, how to average out your pay due to hourly fluctuations, etc.\n\nAgain, I don't think people's issue is that they functionally don't know what a budget is. The issue is behavioral, teaching them *how* to budget doesn't actually *help them* budget. The \"what\" isn't the part they need help figuring out.\n\nAnd tbh, it's worth saying that if life were a little easier on everyone there would be fewer financial problems in general. The issue isn't that suddenly people started not knowing how debt works, the issue is that effective wages are becoming depressed making small financial behavioral issues expand into bigger problems.",

When they realize what they *should* have been doing, it's too late.\n\nMy wife and I met with a financial advisor for the first time about ten years ago.  We were in our late-30's and early-40's, and while we had some decent savings, were concerned about long-term growth into retirement because we were starting so late.  He complimented us on our initiative to start so early.\n\nThat confused the hell out of me, but he said SO many people have no idea how to plan for future finances, noting one of his clients was a 58 year old person with $400 in a checking account and thought they were set.",

School are not to prepare you for life but ARE for educational subjects of which finance is crucial and life changing if done correctly or wrongly. All your other examples aren\u2019t relevant as they are not school subjects. Finance is not a school subject as important as English and math?\n\nYou knew how to navigate the bank, loans, real estate taxes, investments etc with all the nuances of those things all before you were 18 and never made a mistake bravo!\n\nIt\u2019s simply to build a foundation (just like the other subjects you listed) so there is some preparedness for turning 18 and dealing with those things. Just like anything else it should also be taught/reinforced in the home. Also the point is to give a little exposure to those subjects cause hey maybe they enjoy that and choose that as a career field. \n\nBottom line I\u2019d argue this subject starting in 8th grade on up is THE most important subject that can help prepare them for future life. News flash 14-17 year olds also don\u2019t care about the other subjects being taught lol; but it\u2019s part of the curriculum therefore they have to do it. Finance being thrown in wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone and only benefit are youth. The only people that\u2019d-get potentially hurt are loan companies preying on 18 year olds that don\u2019t understand the long term repercussions, credit card companies who prey on the same age, higher ed preying on the same age, and well I digress. Will kid still make mistakes you bet. At least there would be some foundational block laid that might limit the number of people doing this or help mitigate the risk and long term impacts\u2026but hey let\u2019s teach them another humanities class instead!",

This mostly stemmed from having a mother and sister who absolutely could give no fucks about listening to anything I ever said.   Whether it was undiagnosed ADD or what, they were terrible listeners, so I spent my childhood keeping my thoughts to myself and just tuning in more to what others said instead.  \n\nIt's a terrible feeling not to feel heard or understood.  I even worked for an office that helped the mentally ill and a lot of times all they wanted was to just talk to someone.  So I'd let them ramble until I needed to get work done.

If it's in the lawn, I'm not wasting time digging it out. If it's in the flower beds, bye-bye.\n\n>They're pretty (at least when they're yellow)\n\nAgree!\n\n>they help out bees and other polinating insects\n\nThey aren't as beneficial to our native insects, and provide less nutrition to them compared to our native flowers. If you have zero native flowers/trees and only lawn, then yes, dandelions are beneficial, especially in early spring. You also have to keep in mind that non native plants support non native insects, which causes an imbalance in the ecosystem.\n\n>they promote soil health\n\nNot better than natives! But if all you have is dirt, then yes, dandelions are better than nothing.\n\n>they're actually pretty nutritious\n\nAs long as they aren't sprayed with pesticides, or dog pee pee. But if you pull them for eating, pull them young. Don't let them grow in your garden beds and drop seeds after saying you'll eat it haha.\n\nI think you misunderstand me. My clients have golden ragwort growing in their gardens (native flower) and they called me because their previous landscape companies confused them as dandelions/weeds and keep pulling them. They call me because I'm the only one who knows the difference between the two, and can be trusted.",
