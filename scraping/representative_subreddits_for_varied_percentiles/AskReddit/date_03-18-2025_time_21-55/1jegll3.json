I hate that about myself. I hold those close to me to the same standards I hold myself, and those are cruel, impossible standards.\u00a0\n\n\nThey aren't perfect and I couldn't accept that about them. So I told them all the ways they aren't perfect, in the same hateful words I tell myself. I was delusional enough to think I was doing them a favor, the same way I think I'm doing myself a favor when I flagellate myself. I was *enlightening* them. Helping them grow.\u00a0\n\n\nBut they possess the self-respect I lack so they didn't just lay down and take it like I do. They, rightly, stood up for themselves.\u00a0\n\n\nI know I'm being a little hard on myself because we have some very real ethical disagreements that were at the core of that conflict and those will never stop coming between us. We probably are better off going our separate ways.\u00a0\n\n\nBut it's hard to live with knowing how I must have made them feel. And I miss them so much. I tried my best to apologize and to be honest about the failings that led to my behavior, but I don't even know if they read it. And it doesn't matter. That's just my own ego looking for comfort again. I just wanted them to know it wasn't really about them or their failings, it's about me and mine.\n\n\n\nAnyway, thanks for asking, OP.

After the move, we talked less and less. I would try to talk but he would be busy. On Facebook, he started posting some alt-right shit. When I would call him out on it, he deleted my comment. It was then that I decided to block him. \n\n\n\nThe second guy I met because he was the ex husband of my ex's friend. Long story but for a while, my ex was living with them. The friend was basically using her as child care. We ended up hanging out and eventually got into airsoft. It was a lot of fun. We'd also chill at his place, eat and watch either YouTube videos, play games, or anime. After I moved in with my now wife, things got really tough. He also got a better job at the airport so got really busy. I'd sometimes reach out but I think maybe he thinks I left him in the cold. Either way, I hope he's happy wherever he is in life.",

There's not a single day I don't think about them and wonder what they're doing.\n\nBut they dumped me as a friend during the worst time of my life. I wasn't guiltless either, but they made it clear they did not wish to be close to me, and I have never felt so abandoned and broken. \n\nThey cast me aside when my inconvenience outweighed my benefits. Words cannot describe how awful and depersonalizing that feels.\n\nI always told them that the only way I'd ever leave is if they asked me to.\n\nThey asked me to.\n\n\nThey are also in a co-dependant relationship with a partner who doesn't like me, and who I believe has contributed to my friend's isolation and deteriorating mental state. I've been torn, as leaving a friend, even a former one, in a relationship that is so co-dependant and emotionally manipulative is painful to think about. This partner has physically grabbed them and moved them away from others while dancing for example, and I worry that the relationship will become all consuming and eventually they will have nobody but each other.  But maybe they want it that way. I'm learning that my friend doesn't really have room to reciprocate deep connection for anyone else but their partner, and that's exactly what their partner wants. But it's also not my place to say so.\n\nIn the end it's their life, and if they need to push away friends, family, people who care, that's their right. \n\nBut there isn't a doubt in my mind that if my friend called, I'd pick up in a heartbeat. \n\nIf they showed up at my door I'd invite them in, make them tea, and hug them like no time had passed.\n\nFor some special people in our lives, love doesn't fade. It just sleeps. \n\nSometimes it dreams restless dreams filled with sadness and heartache. But sometimes it dreams of summer days without end, presents at Christmas, catching frogs and drinking coffee, and the kind of laughter that makes you forget about time itself. \n\nSometimes love stirs and tears fall all over again. \n\nI won't ever stop hoping they'll want to be in my life again. But I'm realizing they don't have that desire, and so long as they're with someone who makes them feel bad for having me as a friend, I can't be close to them. It's time I respect their choices and move on as best I can, no matter how much I wish it wasn't this way.",

They were matron of honor in our wedding. We got, like, *really close.* At least, from my perspective. As someone with autism, I only have a very select few people around whom I'm totally relaxed, and N was one of them. We used to joke that W and I were N's backup significant others, and tbh, our relationship with them really did feel borderline romantic at times. If nothing else, there was some pretty serious sexual tension between us all.\n\nWe used to talk about sex pretty openly. We'd talked about me shooting some boudoir photos of them, we'd admitted to masturbating to the thought of one another, and at one point when they were single (this was pre-marriage), we attempted a threesome. Unexpectedly, W got really uncomfortable when I went down on N, so we stopped. I think N and I were *wayyy* more into the idea of adding the benefits package to our friendship than W was ever prepared to be, and we had each been operating on drastically different assumptions regarding whatever this was becoming. I had been under the impression that we were tiptoeing into poly territory and it seemed like N was on boardfor, but I guess the threesome experiment made W realize she was both aggressively straight and very much monogamous.\n\nI noticed after this that our friendship with N had lost a bunch of its intimacy. It kinda healed over time, but I noticed they were just a little more guarded from then on, especially if it was just the two of us hanging out without W. Then they got a new boyfriend and started pulling away from us emotionally. \n\nThey ended up moving for unrelated reasons, and over a period of a few months after that, W and I just stopped hearing from them. I have some theories for why that is, but I have no way of proving any of them. We both do really still miss N, though. They were a pretty kickass best friend.",
