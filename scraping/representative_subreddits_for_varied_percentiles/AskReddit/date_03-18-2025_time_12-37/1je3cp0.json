They do plenty of shady things in the middle of the night or during times when the public is generally more distracted by something else or paying less attention to the news, like on the weekend when people aren't following their normal daily routine that may involve getting the news at while on a work break or after work.\n\nAnd conservative outlets can still report this, but it will be more subdued and downplayed. Like they can report the policy of removing anything DEI in general, and give the reasons they say support it. They could report this specific instance of a particular person, but they won't go into the details laying out the guy's wartime heroics, and it'll be a bland article, making it seem like some inconsequential Department of Defense administrative move. It'll be very vague, careful not to suggest there's anything to be upset about. They won't include any quotes of criticisms from people that oppose it, so you'll never be exposed to the arguments that explain why this is outrageous. Although you will see anything the administration says to defend or deflect, such as from the White House press secretary.\n\nFor super extreme groups, like perhaps something on Truth Social or wherever you find lots of openly racist white nationalists, they probably would post it and talk about it in a kind of celebratory way. They don't have to downplay it because they are fully on board with whatever the group think and propaganda goes with, no convincing needed.",

We are in real time watching the fundamental erosion of rights and the framework for all future presidents to follow to continue that trend. We will embrace Russia as an ally and turn our backs on our European allies. I\u2019m just wondering when is Again, what are we trying to get back to? I get he stole the saying from Reagan in 1980 but if he is trying to get back to some time of American greatness when is that time, and specifically what made that time so great. 20 years in the Navy taught me success is a consistent pursuit of a better version of yourself and encouraging those around you to do the same rarely does that mean going backwards.

Campaigning spreads your message, it helps people get excited about the candidate.  Why do you think trump campaigned all four years he was president?  He wanted to make sure he was number one in everyone's mind.  \n\nWhy do you think real Republicans are afraid to speak out against trump and just go along with his bullshit?  They're afraid that musk is going to pay to have them primaried.  If money didn't matter, more real Republicans would be speaking out.  Money moves votes.  \n\nAnd while you say my vote is literally the most important thing I have to give, I respectfully disagree.  I live in a heavily gerrymandered district of a heavily gerrymandered red state.  While this doesn't directly affect presidential or senatorial votes, it very much affects local and federal representation.  My vote doesn't really matter much when my district was illegally created to prop up shit candidates like my current representative.  \n\nIf I can spend my time and money to sway at least two people to vote differently, aren't two votes more important than one?  And if those two people each sway two people?  And so on.  Your vote isn't as important if you don't back it up with actions.  It's just a tick mark on a sheet of paper.",

You can be the richest person in the world, but it doesn't buy sense.  If you have people in a district not voting, you need to find out why, and what can be done to get their vote.  That isn't happening for free.  You need to spend money for outreach.  You need to spend money to move your message.  You need to find common ground and resonate with non-voters.  That isn't free and it isn't cheap.  \n\nMoney indirectly buys votes.  It doesn't matter if it's you, I, George Soros, or Republican George Soros (elon musk).  Money helps campaigns, and campaigns help sway voters.  You need to spend money to get votes, and keep votes.  Money is a way of getting to that goal.\n\nIf the vote was the only thing that mattered, why is so much money donated to PACs?  Why do the major parties have funds tucked away for candidates?  Why do any fund raising at all if the vote is the only thing that matters?  Without money you can't campaign.  Without campaigning, you're not swinging votes.  Money is an means to an end.  \n\nStop pretending money doesn't change votes, directly or indirectly.",

If we peel off 5% of his voters last election, we'll likely win. If we peel off 10% we'll win easily.\n\nAnd since 60% of his voters are a waste of time, we have the other 40% up for grabs. That's a lot when we only need 10%.\n\n>And yeah, I see your point about folks being redeemable. I\u2019m just too cynical at this point to believe it.\n\nWe gotta try our hardest not to be cynical right now because this is all too real and what we do matters. \n\nTry not to think about it in redeeming terms but in the most basic human terms. Think about the world we're in. Think about social media. Misinformation. Disinformation. Post truth. Still talking only about the 40% who aren't hardcores, here. A lot of these people are just trying to live their lives, they don't have the luxury to come here and debate intellectually, they probably dont have the education to do so, and a lot of that is for reasons they didnt decide... but at the same time just because someone is uneducated doesn't mean they're dumb or doesn't know when people are being condescending towards them. And cynicism breeds condescension so its an area I am always checking myself on lately. \n\nA lot of these pople are just frustrated with life and the right is way better at channeling frustration than most of the left. If we listen to them, use basic respect and compassion, and then have conversations, we can help them out. And get a vote at the same time. \n\nBut it starts with us. I'm not asking for nothing, I'm asking for no less than an intellectual revolution on the left where we start to express the kind of radical compassion we always talked about before trump. Now is the true test of our values respect and compassion - neither of which mean weakness or not fighting back when needed - and what I see is many people who I KNOW value respect and compassion, decicing to turn it off when they're not recieving it back, which to me is not how that value has ever worked. Compassion is not transactional. Otherwise it wouldn't be compassion.",

I wouldn't seek out any history from an official government website. There's plenty of reputable sources that won't bend the knee if I want to find that kind of thing. \n\nA lot of you are so young you have only ever seen liberal victories, albeit small ones most of the time. The pendulum swing back to the right is coming like a sledgehammer because it's been decades of wins for us and almost nothing for the right. I'm not talking about political office, I mean the real stuff. ACA, gay marriage, 2 Live Crew at the Supreme Court, Mortal Kombat at congressional hearings, don't ask don't tell turning into trans in the military, just win after win after win. The only exception was after 9/11 for a while. \n\nNow we're getting a true right wing run and people that don't remember the last one think that they're still in a position to say that it can't happen. Very little, if any, of the moves have been illegal. Just what you and I hate. Cutting government jobs is exactly what conservatives want. And with 3 branches of power they'll get it. Setting the rules for the executive branch is *precisely* what a president is elected to do. That means cutting out the wording of whatever they want from these departments. \n\nElections have consequences. Too many of you didn't vote or didn't think your vote through. Now you have to sit and take your lumps when the other side stopped getting a mixed Congress or didn't hold sway over SCOTUS. Maybe this wakes everyone up and we stop taking our democracy for granted. And yes we still have one. \n\nBack to your direct question, we're feeling what conservatives felt when things like trans people were added to high ranking staff or pronouns were acknowledged in the Pentagon. They thought the country they loved was being destroyed and the laws upended to appease psychopaths. We're doing exactly what they did and we're just as certain we're right as they were.

DEI is an acknowledgement that historically groups of ppl have been underrepresented due to economic situations, upbringing and discrimination. Whatever advantage you think these groups are getting now, is merely to put them back on even footing with others in their field.   \n\nThe diversity and inclusion bit is recognizing that on top of historical underrepresentation, there is a lot to be gained by also having a diverse set of opinions and representation, which may not happen without active DEI policies.  \n\nAn example is women in tech. 27% of tech roles are held by women. Is there anything intrinsically different from a woman vs a man performing a tech job? If not, then shouldn't there be actions to encourage participation of women? After all, it wasn't long ago that women couldn't vote or that they had to be relegated to traditional household roles. DEI is about recognizing that such actions are needed to not only change the status quo of the field, but to also convince the perceptions of the 'discriminated' party that they actually are capable of seeking out such opportunities.  \n\nWould you be opposed to offering scholarships or quotas to deserving students from poor households, with the caveat that you recognize due to their upbringing and lack of access to the best schools, their results may be 80% of someone from a privileged upbringing.  \n\nOr better yet, what about political representation which is now dominated by the elderly? Wouldn't it better to have a well rounded representation of multiple age groups and backgrounds because the government, senate etc should reflect the diverse ppl that they serve?  \n\nThese are all examples of DEI. It is not just about sexual orientation, color, ethnicity or gender, but also about age, upbringing, salaries etc.",

It makes way too many assumptions about people based on things that may or may not actually affect the outcome.  \n\nThere are plenty of explanations and studies out there explaining why women are not in tech jobs or engineering (or any field).  A lot of it is the fact that women just make different choices.  But I notice that these arguments about female representation only tend to center around jobs that are popular like tech or positions of power and leadership (CEO, management, etc.).  Why don't we talk about their poor representation in construction, law enforcement, military, or other dangerous/physically demanding roles?  Why is that?

But I am not putting a disadvantaged person into a pilot's seat unless they are a qualified pilot.  I don't necessarily have a problem with choosing a candidate based on their disadvantages if the candidate they are competing against is equal everywhere else.  But it rarely works like that.  Two candidates are rarely equal at all.  I am a hiring manager and can confirm this.  It sounds like a great theory, but it is hard to execute in practice.  \n\nYou claim it is more about historical influences rather than race, gender, etc.  But I have taken DEI training and this is not what they propose.  It is mostly based on how a person looks because frankly, as a hiring manager I have no idea what their background is and what historical forces are at work in their lives when they apply for a job.  How does a hiring manager deal with the historical prejudices that a candidate or their family may have suffered from?  So I need to somehow assume that because a person's appearance aligns with some preset idea that what that person looks tells me about their history?  I need to assume that because someone is black that they are disadvantaged because of slavery?  \n\nMake a better case.  Tell me how you achieve true equity in a society like ours.

Probably.  But you'd have to explain how you have a society without breeding in some sort of expectations.  I mean, no one has done it.  In fact, Scandinavia, arguably the most egalitarian society on the planet, has seen many of the same gender disparity's despite the presence of equality.  You'd have to explain why societies tend toward the same result.  The patriarch probably doesn't explain it or at least it doesn't anymore.\n\nI am also an engineering manager in a tech field.  With several women on my team, actually over-represented by a large margin.  I'll keep my observations to myself, but there are reasons why things are what they are.  Women engage very differently with the physical side of engineering than men tend to.  It's not a bad thing and I'll leave it at that, but it is a difference that is noteworthy.  \n\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=scandinavia+gender+disparity+statistics&rlz=1C1OPNX\\_enUS1113US1114&oq=scandinavia+gender+sipairity&gs\\_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCQgDECEYChigATIGCAAQRRg5MgkIARAhGAoYoAEyCQgCECEYChigATIJCAMQIRgKGKABMgkIBBAhGAoYoAEyCQgFECEYChigAdIBCTE0ODY5ajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=scandinavia+gender+disparity+statistics&rlz=1C1OPNX_enUS1113US1114&oq=scandinavia+gender+sipairity&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCQgDECEYChigATIGCAAQRRg5MgkIARAhGAoYoAEyCQgCECEYChigATIJCAMQIRgKGKABMgkIBBAhGAoYoAEyCQgFECEYChigAdIBCTE0ODY5ajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)\n\n\n\n>A disingenuous argument because as I mentioned we're talking about situations where women are as equipped as men to perform.

They don't because society does not expect them to.  Society is half women.  Do I think women are capable of being in leadership positions?  Yes, but you will not see it as much because women stereotypically are not as disagreeable/aggressive as men. And this is a common trait of people who excel at these positions.  When they are, they actually achieve higher rates of success than men.  I have actually seen this in my own industry, which interestingly is about as tech as it gets.   Women also choose to have children more than men do.  There is a lot to this argument that goes beyond society, but society has something to do with it, for sure.  \n\n>No as a hiring manager you're to assume that having a black person in your team gives you better representation for communities that you serve.\n\nSo wait, now the presence of a person of color \"better represents the community\"?  How?  So every group has to have the \"correct\" number of people in it based on color?  Well, what about sexual orientation?  How am I representing that demographic?  What about physically challenged people?  Little people?  People with mental disabilities?  Where does it end.  The answer is that it doesn't end.  You cannot force a group to represent the demographic that it exists inside of.  It never works this way and racism doesn't explain it.  \n\n>DEI may not be the best way but it's an effort. As opposed to... not doing anything and hoping things get better? Tell me again how the current administration plans to solve equality. If indeed they are truly interested in equality.\n\nSo just throw a dart and hope it lands on the board?  How about dealing with real issues.  Equality has been resolved for the most part, at least at the systemic level.  Yes, there is still work to do, but for the most part success is available to almost everyone.  And we can talk about poverty, but that needs to stand beside the fact that the poorest person in the US is richer than 99% of the rest of the world.  Because you are not living an amazing middle class life does not mean the system is broken.  Not everyone gets to be at the top or even at the middle.  Do you give a shit when the eagle swoops down and eats a salmon?  No.  Why?  Is that fair to the salmon?  Not everyone in a society is going to have the same outcome.  Not everyone gets amazing opportunities.  Not everyone capitalizes on opportunity when they are presented with it.  Decisions are complex and reducing everything to 'sLaVeRy' just doesn't help anyone, especially those who are directly affected.  Government will not resolve it, but removing the roadblock that \"DEI\" as a program created will help.",
