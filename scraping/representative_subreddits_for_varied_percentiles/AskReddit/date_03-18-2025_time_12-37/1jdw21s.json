Both of us lived at home with our parents and didn\u2019t have the opportunity for much alone time outside of the car. \nWe did dark back streets, empty parking lots and structures, canyon and mountain roads- you name it. \nI got into to the habit of tying off my condoms into a knot once we were done, and putting them in the pullout cupholder of my sedans backseat. I didn\u2019t like the idea of littering and I usually just threw them away the next time I had an opportunity. Except for the one time I forgot. \nWe went to go pick up my girlfriend\u2019s little brother from school the next day (he was in elementary) and I hear him say \u201cwhat is this?\u201d \nI nearly had a heart attack when I turned around and saw him playing with my cum filled condom like a water ballon. That was almost 10 years ago and I still feel really bad about it.",

The only people who were supposed to drive forklifts were employees who worked in the lumber area or in receiving, i.e. areas with a lot of need for pallets and large, heavy items. So if we needed one of our pallets of overstock down for restocking, we had to request one of them to go get it. After enough times of waiting for hours for them to get the pallet (or sometimes forget about it), I just decided one day that I had seen them do it enough times that it couldn't be that hard. So I started grabbing my own pallets down after hopping on a forklift if there was one available. I was right, it wasn't that hard. Nobody ever said anything to me and I even started getting requests from people in other departments to grab their pallets down when I was on it. I always figured if management had a problem with it, I would point out that that it's inefficient to have to wait around to restock an empty shelf because there was no one who was \"certified\" available to get it for me.",

That one happens to reach out to me to \"check on me\" not long after the break up. We keep talking for a few weeks and things start getting flirty. In a moment of weakness, against my better judgement, we end up hooking up. I feel bad about it so we stop talking, and I also realize how shitty of an older sister she actually was, because it would've absolutely upset her sister (my ex) if she ever found out. The kicker? I found out later a big reason my ex broke up with me, was because she was basically gaslit and manipulated by that sister into thinking I was a shitty boyfriend. She ruined her little sister's relationship just to sleep with her boyfriend (me).",

Coming from rather traditional families, we both basically hurled ourselves out of there before any of our horny seniors and freshies could their hands on us. We spent the night at a nearby McDonalds and talked, but the scene of seeing our seniors just openly fucking kept replaying in our mind. At around, I think 3am or so, we practically couldn't contain ourselves and just had sex with each other in the same McDonalds toliet stall. We promised not to talk about it nor to each other after that, but days later, we practically couldn't keep our hands off each other. Then, for the next whole four years of our university life, I had this strange sexual relationship with her that was so dangerously irresponsible I have no idea how she didn't get pregnant. Then, on graduation day, we looked at one another one last time, shook hands, and went back to our own countries. I have never contacted her once since, but I still keep this thing a secret from my parents. Why it ended this way, you ask, that's the confession, I have no idea. We just had this strange, quiet brain sync agreement.",

And my family knows it happened, no matter how much I wish they could forget it all.\u00a0\n\nEDIT: I forgot to answer whether or not she feels shame about it. The answer is I don\u2019t know. We rarely talk to each other now, as we\u2019ve both moved to different states. And whenever we do talk, it\u2019s never about that period of our lives.",

For $20 a month, you get access to all his full audios, discord server(we are all like family there), early access to all his content, twitch streams, game and movie nights with all of us on discord, sleepy time videos to help you sleep at night, ect. There is soooo much too offer. But if you want free, he is on the Pornhub, but you will only be able to listen to condensed versions of his full content. I recommend looking him up on the hub first and then if you like his content (you will \ud83d\ude0f) then come one over to patreon.",

Since I've graduated college and am an adult, and always admired him as a mentor, I have him on my social media. \n\nLet me be clear....he's never done anything inappropriate in any way and was one of the very few safe adults I felt comfortable with. He made me fall in love with reading and remembered me years later when people tend to forget me.\n\n\n\nBut I cannot deny that I still have a crush on him many decades later. He's aged well haha",

I'm certain he can tell and when he went to Paris for vacation last year, he visited my favorite authors grave and took pictures of it for me.

Swapped onto a new bus in El Paso later that night and it was packed. As I was walking towards the back a gal around my age moved her bag out of the chair next to her and motioned for me to sit next to her. Me being a dude in my 20s and her being really pretty made it a no brainer. We spent a good portion of the ride just taking about anything and everything; cars, video games, music, you name it.\n\n At this point it's around 2 am and everyone around us is trying to get some sleep. She gets close to my ear suddenly and asks \"can I suck your dick?\" I laugh it off and ask here? She nods as she starts digging through her back, then she pulls out a fleece blanket. She says \"I'll cover up and nobody will notice.\" At this point I my ears are pretty much ringing but I didn't want to tell her no, and I certainly didn't want to miss out on the opportunity so I just leaned back and as she went down on me I helped her get my pants undone. \n\nAfter she finished she grabbed some gum and a bottle of water out of her bag and started carrying on the conversation we were having before like nothing ever happened. She got off the bus in Texarkana and I never saw her again.",

While she was in the hospital I hosted several estate sales to get rid of her stuff as she have to move in with me.  During one of these estate sales a beautiful  woman and I exchanged numbers because she wanted to make an offer on all remaining items when sale was over.  \nOn our first phone call she mentioned that she thought I was cool and would I wanna hang out and go to a museum exihit? \n       Now a little back ground info.  At the time I was married.  I got married at 19 to a 30 year old man who ended up controlling my life.  I was not allowed to have friends so how to act around other adults was foreign to me.\n        Cut to our first time hanging out.  She takes me to a bug museum in New Orleans.  Seems normal until we get to an interactive movie exhibit.  The seats vibrate.  She leans over and whispers in my ear that I should roll my hips forward.  That these vibrations never fail to get her off.  I'm surprised at her comment but brush it off.  After  we walk around Jackson Square holding hands. Ro me this is just what friends must do.\n        The rest of summer was late nights of watching movies together while making out, dry humping and sucking each other's breasts\n         As summer comes to an end she tells me she wants to stay in a fancy hotel downtown together since our time together is coming to an end.  We dress up and go out to eat.  Then come back to room shower then hang out in the room in our fluffy robes and drink champagne.  I end up passing out because I'm not allowed to drink at home.  \n      I awaken in the middle of the night to her fully going down on me and man does it feel good.  I freak out and ask her what she's doing.  She says that she wants to take our relationship to the next level. I ask her what relationship.  She's taken aback.  I truly didnt know she thought we were in a relationship. I tell her I really enjoy her going down on me but I am a married woman.  I'm conflicted so I call my husband in the middle of the night and tell him everything and ask him if I can continue.  He says no fucking way and your in big trouble when u get home.  I tell her this much.  \n       Over the summer I had trickled the truth about my terrible marriage to her.  I had told her about how I was cut off from family and friends.  How I couldn't leave the house unless it was with my kids.  Not allowed to drink and lastly how I had never had an orgasm. When I had asked my husband about orgasms he said they were for sluts.\n         My sorta girlfriend understands and asks to leave me with a parting gift.  She takes me to the bathroom and tells me she gonna teach me to cum.  She has me lay down on the large hotel bath with my legs up the wall.  She takes down the shower head and gets the water temperature just right. She directs it to the right spot by watching my facial expressions then bam fireworks.  I've been a cumming queen ever since.\n      I go home and file divorce.  A bitter and scary year later and I was officially free.  Remarried now to my king. And he adores my bedroom slut origin story.",

I (m) first started masturbating at what I feel like was a young age (around 10 years old... thank you cinemax). One night on my new journey of self discovery I got hot and heavy with myself while the parents were away for the weekend. Since I was still new to this whole thing I coudn't tell that instead of semen what was actually rushing to the surface was piss... in my search for quick pleasure as an adolesent I was instead greeted by a fire hose of piss which I struggled to control and subsequently had to watch in horror as I sprayed the floor, tv, and walls.  Needless to say I was thankful I had a weekend to clean.",

            "body": "My sex life with my wife is dying a slow death and I don't know how much longer I can live with it without leaving. It all started when she got pregnant and had our son. Things naturally dropped off for a while and admittedly I pressured her some for sex but it was driving me crazy only having sex once a month or so for the first year and a half of our son's life. Things got better for a while and we were having sex every 2-3 days and really enjoying it and then she started developing some sort of autoimmune condition and things have slowly dwindled to the point we are now where we have sex maybe 3x a month max and maybe once is it actually enjoyable. Most of the time she doesn't really want any kissing, doesn't want me to go down on her, doesn't want me to touch most of her body, etc. it's not terribly enjoyable but it's also hard for me to turn down when the alternative is getting nothing.\n\nI think part of the problem is she has a lot of days where she feels crappy and on the days where she feels good she would rather spend time doing hobbies she enjoys and can't do every day that aren't sex so I end up mostly getting pity sex on days she's feeling bad. Blowjobs and things are also almost entirely off the table these days and they are terrible and usually require me to finish myself after 30 seconds of her going down on me when they do happen.\n\nI've tried talking to her about it but she doesn't really want to hear it and just thinks I'm pressuring her for more sex, which isn't entirely wrong, but I'd be less concerned about the frequency if it were more enjoyable. I'm doing my best to just bide my time and focus on her well being and hope her doctors can figure something out and in the meantime enjoying other aspects of my life so I don't dwell on this but it's getting harder and harder as time goes on.\n\nTBH part of what's made things difficult is that I've been going to the gym a lot trying to better myself and I guess in some ways hoping getting in better shape and more attractive might make her more interested in me and while it's had some mild effects on her I've been getting a lot more attention from other women, more than any time in my life.\n\nI feel pretty terrible that I feel this way towards her when she's got this illness going on, and I know it would destroy our son, but sex has been a big part of our relationship and my life in general since I was about 15 and it's hard to just be OK with m having a lot less of it. Before anyone asks she would never go for me having a FWB or something on the side and it would almost certainly be the end of our marriage if I floated the idea. I also won't be cheating on her, I'd leave the marriage before that happens but every time I get some attention from an attractive woman I can't help but think of the fun I could be having \n\nI don't even know why I wrote all this. I might delete it but there's no one I can really talk to about it so I post on reddit",

            "body": "I was invited to a party once by a 300+ lbs paraplegic. When my best friend and I got there, it was like a few people cooking chicken. Not a party. But alcohol was there so we stayed. After we ate the chicken, everyone went home. (It was the paraplegic's house.) We drank with her and played some music, bullshitted. Then I take my buddy to the bathroom and I'm like \"yo, I bet she'll suck your dick if you ask her\" he says \"nah man. I couldn't.\" And I egg him on. He musters up the courage to do it, I stay back in the bathroom to give him some time. After a few minutes, I look out the bathroom door and he's sitting on the counter getting his dick sucked. Lol. He looks back at me like \"it worked!\" So I walk over to the other side and whip out my dick and she starts sucking us both off one by one. She grabs my dick like she's the incredible hulk with an iron fist grip. My buddy tries to get his dick sucked again but she refuses his and says she wants mine. So I let her do her thing. Eventually it all stops. I didn't cum or anything but apparently my buddy did. In her mouth. And I didn't know and I kissed her afterwards. Lol. I didn't like taste jizz or anything (not that I know what jizz tastes like anyway). We go back to drinking, listening to music.\n\n(Side story: my buddy knocked her out of her wheel chair that night by being too rough with her chair while she was in it, like fucking around with it. She flopped on the floor and we couldn't get her up. I could see she was ashamed of herself atm so I lied down on the floor next to her and we waited there together until the firemen showed up to get her back in the chair.)\n\nI take a shot of fireball and puke my ass off in the backyard. When the night died down, she went into her room. I followed after but she said she wanted to be alone for a minute. (Probably to take off her diaper and clean herself. Idk. Just my assumption). She calls me in and we get into bed together. I suck on her titties and we make out. I start to move my hand towards her vagina but she asks me what am I doing, so I take it back and say idk. I just like the feel of pussy so I wanted to touch it but I didn't. She turned the light off and asked if we could just cuddle so I did for a few minutes before I told her I'd be right back.\n\nI went out of the room and my buddy and I went to go sleep in the spare bedroom. He was on the floor, I took the bed. My buddy woke up earlier than me so he was out in the living room when some people came by the apartment. They asked him who he is and what is he doing there. Then he replies with, let's say my name is Tucker. He says \"Tucker is in the other room\" lol. Like thanks, bro for calling me out. Anyway, we dip out soon after that and him and I discuss wtf happened that night and we both agreed that our walk was a walk of shame.\n\nNot saying every night was like that but it seemed that every time my buddy and I drank together, crazy shit like that would happen.",

One night, she was over for a visit over dinner and it rained a lot so we couldn't drive her home.\n\nWe watched a movie all night, set up our beddings on the living room, and drank some before we fell asleep. My partner was in the middle and we slept cuddled up while her sister was basically on her own on the other side.\n\nI woke up after a few hours.

I started to rub my boner onto her butt and slowly squeezed her breasts over her shirt using my right hand which was wrapped over her.\n\nShe wasn't responding and was still deep in her slumber. I kept squeezing her boobs, still half asleep myself. I was almost about to start working on pulling her pajamas down.\n\nIt was when I heard the toilet flush and a series of coughs from the bathroom that I realized that my girlfriend had actually gotten up at some point before I woke up to use the bathroom.\n\nI immediately retreated back to my position and closed my eyes, realizing the mistake I made. My girlfriend returned to my side, snuggled into me, and we both fell asleep again soon after.\n\nThe following morning, after we woke up, it seems her sister never knew what happened. We had breakfast normally, with no air of awkwardness coming from her. \n\nBut it still haunts me sometimes. It was an honest mistake, I swear.",

Everything was fine. I was changing. I started thinking differently, feeling differently, looking differently, behaving differently in a span of 2 months, then i increased my dosage. By the end of 3rd month it hit me. Girl puberty really hit me. I wanted a boy. It would feel like i was finally coming in terms with my senses, like everything started aligning with me. I was in heat, i was shaking, I really wanted to feel someone strong touching me, hugging me. So i found a stranger that liked trans people, he happened to be 8 years older than me, very gentle, smart, good looking. We spent a day chatting - we liked each other. Then we met. Oh boy, we spent 1 evening together, just walking and talking, getting to know each other better. Then we ended on his place, with a bottle of great wine, a lot of talking, and me having a courage to take his hand and lead us to his bed. I was still shy, i only snuggled to him. Feeling myself in heat, he asked if he may kiss me. I didn\u2019t respond, but my eyes would tell everything he needed to know. He made his move, and this night ended in the best sexual experience i have had in my entire life. Never had i ever felt so feminine, so gorgeous, so me. \n\nThen, after 2 months of our relationship he disappears, only to tell me he happen to have had main girlfriend all along. My heart broken, i\u2019m pissed, i meet him to tell him everything i think of him, but he forced me to blow him with tears on my eyes, my feelings go so deep i get into autopilot to have sex with him, aaand then i hate myself and stop HRT entirely.\n\n2 years later I\u2019m just a normal guy to everyone again. Except for me. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to have HRT again. I was afraid of what i could become if i let it happen to my dearest vulnerable self again.",

I was 19). We met at the dealers house one day and the conversation wandered into their desire to shoot porn. Specifically gay porn. I joked about how I've enjoyed taking cock for free and they could line guys up around the corner for turns if it meant it could get a few bucks. I had my \"audition\" on the dining room table of said dealer's house and was on a set a couple weeks later where I filmed 2 scenes. That was the first and only actual \"porno\" I was in. It was unsafe. They didn't know what they were doing. I had a GREAT time, but knew that doing more stuff in the manner they were doing it was going to eventually go badly. I have been in other adult video content, but those were more fetish related information/instructional videos.",
