He enjoyed giving me advice and talking about his experience (he was more experienced in sex/relationships than me too).\n\nThe only problem was that he acted like his opinion was the end-all-be-all and *refused* to let me be better than him in anything. Any time I tried to reciprocate by showing him my knowledge, he\u2019d patronize me or straight up just not listen. Funnily enough, we\u2019re in the same field and I run into guys like that all the time (goddamn STEM bastards). Sickening that my self esteem was low enough to actually get with someone like that\n\nIt was the hubris more than the intellect that made me leave. I didn\u2019t realize how fucked his attitude was until i met partners who elegantly balanced confidence and humility",

Ironically I've noticed I have a tendency to comment on reddit for this exact reason!\n\nBut for all my faults, I've never been sexist about it. It doesn't even make sense to me, because as someone who was in advanced courses etc., girls were typically doing *better* than boys, including at the top of my classes. Like the top performing math students were a mix of boys and girls. The people who got an award at my high school for their Calculus BC grades? A mix of boys and girls.\n\nYou have to genuinely be sheltered to be sexist, because there are simply too many highly performing women. How are you *not* exposed to them, if not in school at the least?",

I dated a man who was EXTREMELY intelligent. We're talking about graduating in the top 2% at MIT type of guy. I truly enjoyed talking with him, and he loved to teach. Any knowledge he acquired, he wanted to pass along to anybody who would listen. He was very much \"golden retriever\" (ugh, I hate that term) energy when it came to passing along knowledge. \n\nThen, at some point, his attitude shifted when it came to me. If I expressed a dissenting opinion, poked holes in his theories/facts, or showed him he was flat out wrong, he would start talking down to me. It was only with me, seemingly. Then I noticed women didn't really talk to him much, not even colleagues. Before the \"shift,\" he was already becoming a bit exhausting because the conversations had to be deep and meaningful/productive all of the time. When I dumped him, I realized he never had a \"shift\" in personality. He was just good at hiding it for a bit and was always like that.\n\nMy son is profoundly gifted and already has elite schools checking on him, and he's only in middle school. I'm trying to teach him not to be this way. Luckily, he's a very empathetic and loving/caring kid, so he does take corrections easier. Now, when you poke holes in theories he comes up with, he will research and test (what he can) to disprove your poking. And that's the way to do it! He just becomes obsessive with it, so we are working on a healthy balance.",

My fault was mistaking pride for confidence\u2014the latter of which I\u2019m attracted to.

His insecurity pushed him to be hurtful, insensitive to others\u2019 feelings, and overly sensitive to feedback. My insecurity pushed me to be deferential to his desires, uncommunicative about my feelings, and vengeful when he didn\u2019t care. \n\nI clawed my way outta there and within a few months was on my way to healing.  I think it is rare that someone is \u201cbad\u201d. Hurt people hurt people. I don\u2019t excuse his actions, but I seek to understand. I hope he\u2019s healed from his familial traumas and porn addiction. I hope he stayed single for a bit and learned that he has inherent worth beyond the sexual attention he receives from women\n\nI am now a bit smarter and able to discern overcompensation from comfortable confidence. Plus, I have spent years working on my mental health and building up my internal validation; I am missing nothing from myself, so I pursue friendships/relationships out of leisure and desire, not need and desperation\n\nYes, humility may get you taken advantage of (regardless of gender), but that is part of the inevitable risk of love and sex. We keep honing our characteristics through trial and error. My personal values lead me to prefer an error in which *I* get hurt rather than an error in which I hurt someone else.

There was a study which compared experts to laypeople by having them answer questions  and then rate how confident they were in their answers. Laypeople gave incorrect answers more often but were much less confident that any given answer was correct. Experts gave more correct answers but rated themselves as extremely confident when they gave incorrect answers as correct answers.\n\nMy point is that real intellectuals may enjoy learning something new from discovering they are wrong, but the bar for convincingn them of their error is much higher because their experience is being correct most of the time. Also in my experience intellectuals are very focused on the reasoning process so even if you're right and they're wrong your argument may be inadequate to justify your conclusion so they won't accept it.",

The guy had apparently recently lost his job and we came to the conclusion together that he was basically using all of his free time hopping between hook-ups. The kicker was that we hadn't used a condom because I was on the pill and he told me he had a recently clean STD test and wasn't sleeping with anyone else. That was a frightening wake up call for 18yo me that you can never truly know what somebody is doing and protection is always important.",

Then again, could be a random occurrence. \n\nIt just hits. No warning, no actual trigger. I blackout and wake up in my bed in absolute fear. What have I done this time? Who was involved? What if I did something extra extra stupid? \n\nI've accepted the simple fact that overconsumption is a big risk and no longer possible.

End solution seems to be Alcodroid (app on my phone) and using it when I feel I could be at risk.

Meanwhile she kept trying to find feelings, but wouldn't take any real steps to accept them. I kept hoping for a fairytale ending that was never meant to be. Instead I got the worst rollercoaster. \n\nThe week before Valentine's she ended it on Sunday, called me to change her mind on Tuesday. Wednesday we talk and she expected me to say no, and wants to think it over actually. Thursday she wants to go on the planned date. Great, thought we were making significant progress. We have fun, hold hands the entire time. Sunday invites me over to her family super bowl party. Valentines date we cuddle on a couch and watch a rom-com. She gives me an extremely cute gift. I fall in love. Make plans to play games on Tuesday. Sunday after Valentine's, she decides she wants to talk, and ends it again. \n\nWe did a very similar thing last year. When we tried this again, she said she had a change of heart. That was a complete lie. The core attraction just wasn't there.",

Does it give them the same or does it gotta be a way more awesome thing to get a genuine excitement response from them.   Idk.  Ned Flanders mentality always kinda bothered me. I just felt they weren't being genuine bc for me to walk around smiling waving to everyone everyday every time you run into that person same level of happy.id have to of won the powerball and be set without any monetary worry the rest of everyone's life I care about.

Athletic? etc), and the first messages should be to determine if they're insane or a bot. Once both people are convinced that the other is legit, the convo should immediately pivot to scheduling coffee or another low stakes casual get together so that you can determine *actual* compatibility with each other.

Did we forget to send my nephew a birthday card?\"). It's expected that the Mom figure will take the burden of the daily grind tasks, and if the Mom doesn't, the recipient partner's life falls apart and the house turns into chaos. Dishes don't get done, laundry piles up, food goes out of date, etc etc. The mental burden of tasks are commonly overlooked here. Edit: asking the Mom partner for a to-do list also counts because the burden is now on them to act as a Project Manager and direct the tasks. The Mom partner shouldn't have to make a list; the other person should use their eyes and notice what needs to be done. \n\nThat's where the reciprocity comes into play too. If it's a love language, the acts of service go both ways (even if the recipient partner's love language is not acts of service, they will make an effort to reciprocate by doing nice things because they know it's important to their partner).\n\nTo answer the question directly, I suppose I would draw the line as soon as I felt my partner expected me to do certain acts of service for them, and as soon as I felt it was unreasonably one-sided.",

It is a common disconnect I see within relationships around me: he doesn't want a mom, he wants both of you to live like he did as a bachelor.",

My partner once said a similar line to me about the dishes, that I just needed to let him do it his way. I had been travelling for work, and found that he'd just let dirty dishes sit for two days without so much as rinsing. Then after reminding him, I'd went to put the dry, clean dishes away and noticed that he'd neglected to clean the underside of the dishes (they'd been stacked on top of one another when dirty). In that instance, I'd been assigned the role of Mom because I needed to act as an auditor of his chores to ensure we were living hygienically. He at first argued I was being nitpicky.",

It feels so unfair sometimes. Anyhow\u2014\n\nAt one point when we were first together he mentioned that he loved that I already had a child because I, \u201calready knew what to do.\u201d I see now that meant that I would be doing 95% of the up-front work.\n\nAnd he\u2019s come a long way, he really has and I\u2019m quite proud of him\u2026 But I\u2019ll be damned if I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m raising someone else\u2019s kid from time to time because his Mom didn\u2019t want to give him any responsibility growing up.

I assume it\u2019s because he just kind of feels like she\u2019ll do things, so he becomes lax. I think if we had opted for private childcare/a nanny he would stay more focused. I know it\u2019s not a forever thing. It just really sucks to feel like he needs to be managed (to a degree), but I don\u2019t need to be. \n\nOh wait bonus: I asked him what his plan would be if I died (because this is real life and I expect he\u2019d remarry eventually) and he said, \u201cI\u2019d go to the gym early in the morning when the Moms go\u201d and I was like, \u201c\u2026 So you\u2019d marry someone who\u2019s also a Mom?\u201d And he responds, \u201cYea, I like someone who knows what to do.\u201d\n\nLike damn.

Our conversation quickly got to a point where I was thinking hey, if he was MY bf I'd be pissed that he was saying these things to his ex, so I told him it was best we stopped talking out of respect for his gf.\n\nHe proceeded to send me this *massive\" text explaining he and his gf were \"selectively polyamorous.\" He said his gf was a sapiosexual who needed more intellectual stimulation than he could provide (truth, he had only a few topics he would ever really talk about) and he would occasionally get involved with other women for the physical side of things. I had no idea what to say so I just replied \"You do you, but I still think we need to end this!, and blocked him. I guarantee you if I'd offered to hook up with him he would have jumped at it. Just a chronic cheater using \"polyamory\" as an excuse to fuck around.",

                            "body": "Have you gone unmedicated before? I mean after starting, have you ever taken a long term break? My type 2 partner was medicated for years, started an intellectually demanding new job in litigation, and within a few months claimed that he could not be on mood stabilizers anymore because they are a risk to his job, because of their blunting effect on his brain. Said they make him too fuzzy. He was working as an attorney for years with medication, but doing work (probate, contact, copyright, etc) that was less mentally demanding than the litigation job. \n\nMy position since we first started dating (and also before we agreed to move in together and get much more serious about a life together) was that I was there to be a supportive and understanding teammate and could roll with the realities of being with someone with bipolar disorder, with the one requirement that a medication to stabilize mood (whatever form or type that may be) would be part of the regimen. I was clear that a bipolar partner who chooses to be unmedicated, no matter how valid their reason, was not something I was willing to put myself through. I specifically brought this up at the beginning so that this position was very clear, that refusing to be medicated was a dealbreaker. \n\nSo fast forward a year, where he\u2019s a few months into his awesome new job, that he loves and is great at, and he says he can\u2019t take his current med anymore, and wants to try going without daily mood stabilizer med due to the risk to his job; instead his doctor offered him a \u201cbreak glass in case of emergency\u201d prescription med that could be taken to kill a manic episode of one started brewing or was happening. I was against this, but said we could try it if he felt it was necessary, as long as he authorized me to contact his doc directly in the event of concern. \n\nAll was fine until I went out of town for a week, and the evening of the day id left, the manic came on. He tried to hide it from me, finally admitted yes that\u2019s what was happening, 2days later. Missed a day of work because of it. \n\nGot back on lamictal and took it for 5 days before deciding that no, his head was fuzzy again, that wouldn\u2019t work. I said I just want to make sure that you\u2019re still committed to being medicated with something for mood stabilization, which no, your Wellbutrin doesn\u2019t count for this; because that\u2019s for the depression, and the risk (to you, to us, to your job) is the mania. He wouldn\u2019t reaffirm his commitment to that, saying in response, over and over, that he\u2019s \u201copen to medication but not going to take anything that puts my job at risk, being fuzzy is a bigger risk to my job than a manic episode would be.\u201d\n\nI said you know going unmedicated with no intention to get back on one is, and has always been, a dealbreaker for me. We tried it, against my better judgement, because I wanted to be supportive, but it didn\u2019t work, you had a manic episode and lied to me during it. If you can\u2019t commit to medication as agreed in the beginning of this, then I\u2019m gone.\n\nHis response was that that was a toxic ultimatum, that I was trying to force him to be medicated and that\u2019s fucked up. I said it\u2019s not an ultimatum I\u2019m not trying to force you to do anything \u2014 it\u2019s MY boundary/dealbreaker, and I\u2019m the one who will be forced to take an action to protect myself, (leave/break up) if you can\u2019t confirm that you\u2019re still committed to mood stabilizing medication. I\u2019m not forcing you to do anything, I\u2019m saying what I\u2019ve said since day 1, that if you\u2019re not going to mitigate the risk of manic episodes with meds, I will have to exit for my own sake. \n\nIs that how you would see that \u2014 as an ultimatum that is trying to force you to do something (take meds)? Maybe this is a question better posed to one of the bipolar subs, but I\u2019m curious as to just how unreasonable my position is, from the POV of someone with bipolar 2. I realize that\u2019s a long ass comment and if goes unread/unanswered, I totally understand, lol",

Especially when you know the people you are talking to are 1. not of the same political opinion and 2. aren\u2019t interested in arguing with you about politics.",

At first he was fine with me until he realized he couldn't use me to manipulate her into being more obedient to him.  I am a Christian and have been since a very young age.  He tried using the bible to convince me that the slightest intendance on her part was a sin and I was supposed to also be obedient to him since if I married her he would be the patriarch of the family.  He had made sure she didn't have real world job skills and was completely dependant on him financially.  When it became clear to her he was never going to accept us she broke up with me declaring how un-christian I was and I just wasn't the moral kind of person she needed.  About 4 years after that and one year her sister died she finally just ran off.  She was always bi but now she just absolutely hates men, last time we talked on FB it all came out.

A lot more men are just sex addicts than would like to admit and would not be in a committed relationship if they could get sex whenever they want. This is why gay men have the lowest divorce rates because the only gay guys who get married are the ones who are in it for the long haul. Bi men are in a unique situation where they live in both worlds, having access to easy hookups with men while also experiencing the much more difficult hookup culture straight men go through. This leads some bi men to enter a committed relationship with a woman to satisfy the desire for sex with women but still having that desire for frequent NSA hookups with men. Do bi men cheat more often? idk I don't have data on that, but there's a specific kind of pressure to cheat that only bi men will understand and that is what this person is getting at. The kind who want frequent NSA sex with men and women but can only get it with men so they get into a relationship and cheat instead of being honest with themselves.",

She'd claim they just wanted to give her some extra money because they cared about her, but... Come on! I'm not an idiot! I know what was happening and I never want to be in a relationship where I have to wonder about stuff like that again. \n\nI know some, maybe even most strippers are capable of keeping it professional, and can have long and healthy relationships in their personal lives, but I don't want to deal with any of it ever again.",

They all consistently looked down on me and ragged me because I guess to them because I was wearing jeans and a regular shirt. I was a redneck.? Meanwhile metal is my favorite genre out of many,  and they barely knew anything about the bands that were playing, even though I had been listening to them for ages and play guitar in a garage metal band ?  Her friends eventually convinced her to ditch me, all while she insisted that I get a ride an hour and a half away to the concert and she and her best friend would take me back home. That didn\u2019t happen and it was an outdoor arena and started pouring. Before they cast me away, I begged them to tell me what I did and they literally just kept flipping their wrists saying h go away go away. I thought I was freaking dreaming.

I had a relationship with a man who was a Christian himself and also came from a very deeply Christian family. At the beginning of our relationship, he assured me that it didn't matter and that it would never be an issue, but his parents and siblings abhorred my lack of sharing in their beliefs. They weren't shy about making their suboptimal opinions of me known, and they constantly pressured him into trying to convert me. This affected our relationship in major way, and inevitably, our relationship ended.\n\nI've also met other Christians who are so full of love and embrace the beauty in individuality, so I understand that not everyone is the same, but, based on my own failed experience, I could never again commit to anything more than a platonic friendship. There was just too much of a difference in moral compass and general worldview for it to work romantically.",

It started being way too much for me. And I don't mean this as a criticism, she deserved someone who could fulfill those needs, who was able to be there 24/7 and be a rock for her. I just couldn't be that person.\n\nShe moved out May of 21 after a blow up argument. I haven't spoken to her since. I hope she's doing well.\n\nBut never again.

For anything he decided he \"couldn't\" eat he would have me describe the ingredients and flavors in excruciating detail then, if he allowed himself a bite and liked it, he'd go \"this tastes so high calorie!\"\n\nAnother guy loved to watch me eat whatever I ordered as he ate his gross-looking unseasoned wet chicken breast over dry salad. He would just sit there silently smiling and staring at me as I ate and whenever I tried to make conversation he'd just say he wanted to see me enjoy my meal. \n\nThe last dude was OBSESSED with macros and supplements. My final straw was when I got up from the table to grab us sauces and utensils and came back to find that he dumped two scoops of creatine in my water glass and then bullied me into drinking it smfh. That shit tastes like pencil shavings!",

He'd refuse to go anywhere with me and my child, if he a: didn't have his kids because they'd want to go and would miss out so he won't go or b: anywhere his kids would want to go but he couldn't afford to go if his kids were with him.\n\nWhich meant my child and I either had to stop going to places we loved or go without him. We always went without him. I had a good wage, and we live very comfortably. What made it worse us he was her ex husband #2 so every other weekend he had his 2 kids from their marriage, her older 3 kids from her first marriage and sometimes ex husband #1 stayed with him because he couldn't accommodate his own 3 kids..\n\nIt was a shit show. Shes apparently now got another 2 kids from husband #3 and you guessed it, he has them with the others every other weekend because \"it's not fair to separate them\" I understand partially the older 3 as he was married to their mum and he helped raise them, but this last 2?!?! That's weird.\n\n\nAnyway, my child is now 18 and at uni, I was married when I had her but young. Moat of my friends have kids that are not even 10 yet, and I refuse to date anyone with kids, I've been there done that and have the empty nest to show for it.",
