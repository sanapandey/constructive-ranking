The last thing I said to her is to never contact me or get near my dog again because I had her email admitting to breaking into my house, stealing my dog and threatening to hurt her, and at this point I was willing to get lawyers and the police involved.\n\nNow, an ex kidnapping your dog and threatening violence in order to manipulate you into whatever they want you to do is batshit crazy by itself, but the thing that really pissed me off is that we were together for about eight years and she was my GF when I adopted my dog back when she was a puppy several years before, so my dog absolutely loved her and saw her as her other owner.\n\nI honestly don't know if she was just bluffing or if she would've hurt my dog if I hadn't immediately gone to get her back, but that shit was psychotic anyway. Thankfully it's been years now and that dog lived to be a venerable 15 years old before finally passing away in my arms after a full life, and I never saw that crazy ex again.",

For example, I get on a call if I'm thinking that we're going to have a normal talk, and he shows me a picture of his dick immediately as we start the conversation. He would often lead the conversation in sexual areas. I didn't always feel comfortable with that, but if I said no he was going to threaten to hurt himself.\n\nA lot of my friends have told me that I was being dick to him and that I should have been more accepting of this. Please remember that this was a high school relationship. I don't think I would have been compatible even if I was as accepting we didn't share a lot of interest with each other besides liking to text. so, if you can, let's frame it out of who is the bigger dick, and more of compatibility.
