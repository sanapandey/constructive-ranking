When I ask if he would vote for the opposition in response he said no. He will always vote for Republicans.\n\n\nEdit at 722: obviously I don't know the red line is for this guy. He thinks musk is an idiot. And that we are getting close to his red line. If that helps.",

It was something done *in response to* Republicans voting this way, and still didn't work because liberals and progressives simply don't vote this way.",

You can say what you want about MAGA politics, but until the people who disagree with MAGA get off of their asses and vote, we'll just keep yoyoing back and forth between Democratic presidents who enact policies and then Republican presidents undoing them.\n\nI don't understand why it's so hard for democrats and the left in general to get out and vote, even in the face of MAGA, while still acting holier than thou and refusing to vote democrat for 1 or 2 issues. If you're not willing to vote, which the majority of young people don't as well as some of the loudest left/liberal voices online don't either, then you have no right to complain about anything Trump is doing.\n\nI'm so damn tired of the fake tears online, the \"don't vote for Kalama cuz Palestine\" the \"democrats aren't in particular catering to me specifically so I'm not going to vote for them\"\n\nUntil people who claim to care so much about being anti-MAGA get off of their asses and VOTE, there's no reason for democrats to listen to them and there's no reason to respect their opinions on politics, MAGA, etc if they refuse to vote democrat for arbitrary reasons. \n\nThe cycle will continue of leftists/liberals refusing to vote, then crying online for MAGA or another right-wing person winning, and then conservatives actually putting their money where their mouth is and voting.\n\nUntil the left in general stops petty arguments and acting like politicians have to cater to them and their individual needs, MAGA will continue to be a cancer upon politics because Republicans will continue ignoring whatever issues they have with the party and voting for them no matter what.",

I know, because I listened in the late 80s, early 90s, and it had an impact on me, I regret to admit. At least 3 hours a day, 5 days a week, every week, every year, multiple times during the same show, over and over and over and over and over and over again. You get a song in your head because pop radio stations play certain songs over and over again. Beat it. We built this city. The Macarena. The same thing. Dems took it for granted. Never countermessaged. Just like they never ran for many local offices, leaving hundreds of elections unopposed for local and state Republicans to fill, until Run For Something realized, retroactively, the mistake.\n\n\nAnd then Fox came around and extended the relentless propaganda from 3 hours 5 days a week to 24 hours 7 days a week.\n\n\nNeed a lot more counter-messaging building on top of each other. Not just 2 layers of counter messaging, or 5. But dozens if not hundreds of layers to break the disinformation. I recall a cult expert mention that each hour of brainwashing requires at least an equal hour of deprogramming.",

Men being men they quickly \"found\" their own wives (or concubines, or slaves, it was frequently very very ugly), which quickly meant that everyone with power in the colonies was mixed race (except, say, the governor, who might have come directly from Spain or France).  Fast forward a few hundred years and almost everyone is mixed race, and they have more of an issue with \"colorism\", since being whiter and more European historically meant more money, status, power, education, etc.  \n\nThe English and the Dutch were trying to make money, but were also trying to fix an overpopulation problem, so they sent entire families, and lots of them.  And several of the places they colonized had fewer surviving natives - the USA/Canada region and Australia always had smaller native populations which were then decimated by diseases, and most of South Africa when the Dutch arrived had recently been conquered by the Zulus, killing huge numbers of people and leaving lots of land nearly empty.  Plus bigotry and puritanism.\n\nAnyway, that's still an oversimplification, and culture still played a big factor, but the primary reason places like Latin America are so much more \"mixed\" than the USA historically is because the colonies were set up very differently.",

We took hard steps and prevented a lot of death and suffering early. We are probably the nation in the world that trust China the least. \n\nYou should be pissed. But not at the lockdowns or mask mandates. But at politicians who lied to you for political gain. About vaccines. About face masks. About just proper common hygiene that has been practiced for thousands of years.\n\nSo yeah I'm pissed as hell. It was so preventable. We had almost 20k deaths and we consider that a national tragedy. We held at less than 100 before someone broke the rules and caused an outbreak.\n\nThe US however has over 1 million deaths. Ten times per capita compared to us, and it was so preventable. So unnecessary. Just because your lives don't matter to them. All the politicians who told you it's a hoax got vaccines as soon as it came out. They got top tier healthcare from professionals who took it seriously. They know. Yet they let people get themselves hurt or killed. People who trusted them.",

When the next \u201cbad\u201d thing happens, and the sub you are on quite a bit asks whether the person in charge was a woman or a PoC (because I have seen this on the threads), and the second they find out it was a woman/PoC, how many comments immediately jump to \u201cthis was obviously a DEI hire\u201d. I want you to pause for just a second and think \u201cwhat if this person IS qualified and just happens to be a woman/PoC?\u201d\n\nThis is why it seems like a dog whistle for racism. It currently seems like based on this discourse, that many conservatives can\u2019t even FATHOM that a non-white male could be in a position of power.

In fact, it's decidedly not that, as for so many many years folks hired white men b/c they were 'normal' and made the employer feel 'comfortable' and not b/c of merit. DEI was LBJ's attempt to counter that and pushed folks to hire based on merit and regardless of race/etc. Meaning, don't pass up the black woman just b/c she makes you uncomfortable. Hire her if she's qualified and get over your prejudices. That's DEI. I'm an elected govt official myself (and in liberal Oregon) and never once EVER have I hired or fired anyone b/c of race, but I sure do have a diverse workforce under me. Know what I mean?",

However, literally every person has the same basic needs to survive. \n\nLet's just do a simple example of equity in action: the goal is to provide every person in the US with clean drinking water. There is not a single human being to have ever lived who did not need drinking water. Having that water be clean saves money and boosts productivity by preventing disease. \n\nHot Springs, VA, is not going to need the same water system as Phoenix, AZ. \n\nNot only is Hot Springs over lots of natural groundwater, but it is also tiny. The entire county has only 4,209 permanent residents, with the town itself sitting at under 750. It is in the heart of the temperate Appalachian rainforest. A system to deliver clean drinking water would be relatively inexpensive to build and maintain. Let's say the federal government grants Hot Springs $5 million to build and maintain their drinking water.\n\nPhoenix, AZ, has 1,662,607 permanent residents and is in a river valley in a desert. The water table is not particularly high. It costs a lot more to get every resident clean drinking water - let's say the government grants Phoenix $500 million to build and maintain their drinking water. \n\nIt is not *equal*, but it is *equitable.* \n\nIf Hot Springs started getting huffy that Phoenix was getting so much more money to get clean water, they would be acting irrationally. We would be able to understand that from a logical, practical point of view, they would be bellyaching over nothing. It would be outrageous for Hot Springs, VA to demand the same water treatment facilities as Phoenix, AZ. \n\nLikewise, if Phoenix started whining about how much money was being spent on snow plowing public roads in Hot Springs and demanded their own snow plow, we would also see this technical equality as being absurd. \n\nEquity is merely acknowledging that no one is starting from exactly the same place with exactly the same needs. \n\nIt is an attempt at fairness. \n\nNow, please ask yourself who is benefiting from you being staunchly against efforts to make life more fair.",

Some leftists say they were never anti-gun btw because the revolutionaries they like weren't exactly...law abiding or peaceful.\n\nI think most people aren't anti-gun in the US, they just want more stringent requirements considering just how easy it is to get a gun. (although I personally grew up in a country without them (and didn't have any mass shootings go figure), so I could live without them, but I also know it's part of the US culture, so i have to accept it. my partner has guns, and ive been to a shooting range but seeing them makes my blood run cold).",

Race is the group they are focused on and it is stunningly obvious. \n\nSo from now on, when anyone uses the acronym DEI, I am demanding they articulate which LAW they deem to be \"DEI\" and what specifically about that law they want changed, and how they would implement that change.\n\nThese people think they can just wave magic wands and things suddenly change for the better. The reality is many of these policies have significant downstream impacts when they are changed or removed and we have to be conscious of that fact so People are not actively harmed by doing so. An example is if our government is terminating \"DEI\" hires, and they terminate a doctor that is overseeing a medical study which has implanted medical devices in a number of real people (patients)...they need to be sure those patients are given properly alternative care and not just left in the lurch with no doctor to help them because a test device is in their body and no doctor outside of that trial in their right mind would mess with it.",

At some point in the last two decades, we stopped being curious about how \"the other side\" thinks, and chose to start ridiculing them, because it's far easier to dismiss what we'd rather not understand. Both the right and the left do this, and that's okay to admit.\n\nCongress is a place where people of differing ideologies should come together to forge productive, logical solutions to emerging issues through compromise, not engage in political tribalism. It's okay to be curious and ask questions about things you don't understand. I honestly recommend it. But if you just wave your hand and call \"the other side\" 'fascists' and 'Nazis', you kill that conversation before it even gets a chance to start.\n\nMost people on the left are not uber-progressives, in the same way that most people on the right are not fascist ultra-nationalists. In fact, I'd be willing to wager that the majority of Americans agree on virtually all issues in one way or another, but we've divided ourselves into opposing teams instead of the collaborative collective that it was always supposed to be.\n\nBe curious. Ask questions. Name-calling never helped anyone, and only serves to deepen the political divide.",

Since I moved here in the 90's they're still vocally fighting the Civil War. \n\nWhen I was in high school, they still had Lee Jackson King Day. All the Mosely boys would muster in the Food Lion parking lot. They'd drive over to the high school in a convoy and stop in the parking lot bottle neck and play Dixie on a loud speaker and fly the Confederate flags high. Then our vice principal would pull them into the office and they'd whine about \"my free speech\" and \"it's my heritage, not hate\" and as soon as they thought nobody was listening they'd call her the n-word. They used to drive around off school property with little nooses hanging from their rear view mirrors. Fucking cowards. \n\nI'm still friends with a lot of these guys on Facebook. And yes they still regurgitate all the same racist bullshit that they used to. They haven't changed. They're deeply entrenched in their beliefs that their ancestors were somehow victims. And they are continuing to fight the fight. And they are continuing to fight the fight I know for a fact that a lot of them see Donald Trump and Project 2025 as the South rising again. \n\nIMO, I think The monuments down all monument avenue should be replaced with monuments to Oderus , the 1994 Richmond Braves, Tank Boy and Dirt Woman.

What you're talking about is what started out as the classical B-school \"diversity\" training, and the \"colorblind society\" thing that 90s kids grew up being inundated with. We are all different, different perspectives can result in better ideas, don't discriminate against someone just for being different, etc. That's what it's taught as academically, and that's what it's *supposed* to be, with a splash of \"be more aware of your own biases, including implicit bias.\"\n\nBut it's also a semi-formal \"thing\" in practice. Some places were hiding (illegal) racial \"quota\" type systems using \"DEI\" as a buzzword shield. I remember sitting in a hiring panel as an SME, having graded resumes for a first down-select, and one manager going \"there's still too many. We have too many men in this office, let's just throw out all the men and hire a woman.\" And the EEO office rep AGREED before the ultimate selection authority cut that off.\n\nThat's the kind of thing a lot of conservatives think of when they hear \"DEI.\" Being told they're the \"wrong color\" or \"wrong gender\" for a job (real unofficial feedback an acquaintance got after being passed over for promotion). Or worse, being afraid their *kid* will be told they're the \"wrong color\" or \"wrong gender.\" Sure, those aren't \"real\" DEI, but those kinds of things *do* happen at the individual level, and the Republican machine linked the term \"DEI\" with that sometimes-practice in the minds of voters. So now we have \"DEI\" that both is and isn't DEI.\n\nKind of like how \"Defund the Police\" simultaneously meant \"divert funding from police departments to social services because not every situation calls for a gun and handcuffs\" and \"no we really meant we want to abolish police departments across the nation\" depending on which advocate you were talking to. Or how \"CRT\" is both a graduate-level sociological framework for legal and historical analysis and a daily lens for viewing everything in a race conscious, intersectional way (which then seems to have morphed into \"woke\").\n\nIt's all kind of fascinating how all of this morphs from academia to (mis)implementation in the \"real work\" and down to talking points... or would be if it weren't having such disastrous results for society.",

Both my parents are vets and most of my family are too. My parents worked comms and my dad's  side of the family is Mexican-American (and iirc some technically native, but not registered).\n\nI know my dad talked about it being like an opportunity. Not great because it's based in exploitation, but most of my family holds the opinion that the military is exploitive by nature. You give your body and mind to the military, they use it, spit you out. \n\nSure you get your benefits, but at the cost of your body/mind potentially not working right for the rest of your life (or as one of my friends describes his experience \"the military is the reason I can't shit right anymore and have a habit of throwing up multiple times per week\").\n\nMost of my family has told a lot of us younger generations to never join the military unless you're desperate enough. They're proud of their service and other people who've served. But how their services get used/changed is what makes it hard to recommend people join. Plus there's plenty of other ways to serve your country.\n\nFor people of color (iirc Latinos were able to join the military before black people were), that wasn't always an option they had (to be able to join) or at least not with the same benefits/treatment/recognition.\n\nIirc the Navajo weren't initially recognized for their efforts. Being able to recognize efforts like that helps beat the push for things like heavily forced assimilation and the erasure of native cultures. More broadly, it helps us acknowledge that people can fight/work for their countries effectively in ways that differ from the dominant culture. It helps give more people opportunities. \n\nThat being said, DEI has its purposes. It's recognized for plenty of reasons.\n\nI personally don't think it's always implemented well or even pushes for diversity, equity, and inclusion very well (I've definitely questioned some motives in certain situations), but I still think it's important to recognize certain efforts and consider the differences to what that looks like in different time periods.\n\nTl;dr\n\nDEI isn't anything new and imo it's important to consider it as an actual concept rather than just another bureaucratic label.",

How could information about Navajo Code talkers fall under that purpose?\n\n-In what ways is DEI implemented?\n\n-What are the criticisms against DEI and what is the motivation for its removal?\n\n-What alternatives are being offered and how is that being implemented?",

This keeps people busy trying to fix an issue that wasn't there a few months ago. \n\nDivide and conquer. That's always been his modus opperandi. Keep people busy on this battlefront so they aren't busy fighting and energizing on another front that is more sacred to his mission. Half of America, if they focused on just one issue at a time, we could truly counter his rape of the Constitution. But we are busy fighting these smaller battles that suck up our energy, time and bandwidth.\n\nWe need to first get more organized and realize what he is doing, get smarter about it. Then we can be more effective in countering the things he is trying to accomplish. Focusing Americans has not been our strong point.",

I imagine this is how you act all over the internet.\n\nMost of the people like you saying \"I just reminded then of J6\" go into a sub and sometimes it's entirely unrelated, saying something \"WHAT DID YOU FUCKERS FORGET ABOUT J6??!\"\n\nThat isn't \"reminding\" that's being an ass.\n\nEDIT: looking through your history, are spreading some political falsehoods and your rhetoric is needlessly aggressive. It's no wonder you were banned and I don't believe you for a second that you were \"just reminding\" people and I can assure, no one there needs to be reminded it happened. But you need to be reminded how to talk to people.\n\nAlso \"up and visible\" is great. But this question was asked of conservatives and you guys felt the need to answer for us.

Should we praise traitors who supported slavery in the face of the rest of the nation? No. If anything, I maybe support changing the plaques associated with them to teach about the sad and disgusting history that followed those figures rather than destroy them. Destroying historical structures of statues is a good way to put them out of sight and out of mind, which is a great way to forget that it happened, which serves no other purpose than to have history eventually repeat itself. Instead I am more of a proponent of turning it into a historical lesson, and I'd encourage the cities and recreational departments to  allow to surround the structures with donated sculptures that represent the unity of our country as a better place after defeating the confederates. Plaques, murals, sculptures, etc., as it would also to help portray the fact that the Confederacy was a dark time in US history, and the good that comes out of triumph and unity working together to build a better country from our mistakes.\n\nFinally, I have issues with associating the Navajo code talkers as diversity hires. They absolutely were not. I do however oppose some of the practices and ideas behind DEI style policies. People regardless of race creed and color should have an equal opportunity in the US; full stop, no ifs, ands, or buts. However it's a delicate balance between how do you contain and limit the powers of prejudice without forcing and fool-hardily embracing hiring people solely out of the essentially exact same prejudiced logic. Your race, gender, sexual preferences, religious views, and political opinions should bear no difference on your conduct or career as a civil servant, nor should they be discussed or displayed on government property. As an actual advocate of the separation of church and state, the same theory should apply to many facets of life as they are decisions made by each individual according to their own life experience, and therefore should not be represented through your workplace and job. We are all individuals we all have different lives, and we all have different opinions: the best way to represent that is with an open and vast landscape of unity despite diversity instead of individual diversity being represented over unconditional unity.",

I felt that attempts to do so were just knee-jerk reactions from out-of-touch people a thousand miles away that didn't know what sweet tea was and probably didn't wipe their feet before they entered the house, either. They were blowing everything way out of proportion, *right?* -- a bull in a china shop it had never even *seen* before but saw fit to wreck, anyway. Slavery, segregation, racism -- these were all battles we as a society fought over *decades* ago, and the good guys **won**, *decades* ago!\n\nSlavery was abolished, of course, and what a sad stain on human history that was!\n\nSegregation ended, thank goodness; I can't *believe* anyone thought that was a good idea, anyway.\n\nAnd of course, racism has fizzled out; all the white people saw all the pain of black people and other minorities, realized the cruelty and injustice inflicted, recognized the moral arc of the universe and the trend towards greater and more universal freedom and the accompanying futility of their intolerance, and all feel *really* bad about all what happened and we're all so happy society doesn't believe in those bad things anymore!\n\nSo, ***of course*** those monuments aren't actually *celebrating* confederate soldiers or slavery and racism as a practice -- ***after all, no one actually believes in those things anymore!*** Therefore, the *only* conceivable purpose of the monuments is as a candid acknowledgement of **History**, of the mistakes of the past. Surely it's obvious we maintain these monuments as a solemn expression of virtue, of dedication to never forgetting the lows we as people were capable of! Yankees don't seem to realize it, but this is how we wear our scars on our face, so no one can claim it didn't happen, and by making sure the past isn't forgotten, we also educate our youth and protect our future! You'd actually be making racism (which pretty much died out in the 60s) *worse* by getting rid of them!\n\nThat's what I thought, anyway...\n\nbut I was also a hopelessly idealistic, naive white youngin who grew up with his home as the butt of every joke -- who grew up in a sheltered liberal home in a white neighborhood and never heard anyone say anything racist to **any** of the black people who weren't there, and just couldn't believe anyone could think anyone actually still believed that racism stuff anymore, and won't they just leave us alone and go back to mispronouncing \"pecan\" and eating that weird crappy wheat gruel that's like grits if grits were also 100x worse?\n\nOf course, as time went on and Harambe came ever closer to becoming a meme, I saw greater evidence that, actually, some people ARE still racist peices of shit and, actually, A LOT of people are still racist pieces of shit and wait no they *actually* think the confederacy were the good guys?  Some become cops and literally step on black people's necks and other people don't just *stop* them? This guy actually thinks Obama is from Kenya? He's not just saying that to be mean?\n\nSo yeah. It was enlightening to see the rot spread out of from behind the wallpaper, and sobering to realize how much I'd hung on that wallpaper without realizing what was festering behind it all this time. If I'd had less support from thoughtful minds growing up, it's not impossible to think I might've joined that rot, earnestly believing I was in the right. I'm not a conservative now and never have considered myself one, but I'll state that obviously stripping service awards from anyone for any reason besides gross criminality is a disgrace to the service, the person, and the award, and all those else who have ever received that award.",

Maybe they should have a link or something to more information. I personally believe that any government website should have the basic information, basically all the departments in it, all the government employees, how to find (fill in the blank with what ever you want), and how to file a FOIA in person or over the the computer. \n\nI also believe we should leave the statues standing, they should be remembered. We need to remember that the civil war was fought by people on both sides. We should learn about both sides so that we can understand why they did what they did. If we pull them down all we are doing is removing the face of the confederates and turn them into a buggy man of some kind that can fit every kind of role",
