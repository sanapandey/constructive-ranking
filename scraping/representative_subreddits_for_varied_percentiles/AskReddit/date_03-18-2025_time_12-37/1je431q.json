I've always been fascinated by etymology and regularly practice the regional dialects and accents I come across.\n\n\nFor a long while now, my own accent has been unidentifiable cause I've let so many of those accents bleed into my own. Along with that are all of the different  slangs. I've made a game of guessing the slang era of a conversation partner and fitting it accordingly. So, just like my accent, my regular slang is a mosh posh of everything over the past 60ish years. Except for this latest brainrot nonsense. Just like fetch, it's never gonna be a thing.",
