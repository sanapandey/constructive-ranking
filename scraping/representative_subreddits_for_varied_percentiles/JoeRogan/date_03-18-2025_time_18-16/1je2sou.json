                    "body": "Ok.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ja2by7m3xfpe1.jpeg?width=1691&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92513c71854f9a30c5d749cd305c6cb412020225\n\n>There\u2019s no direct evidence from credible sources that neoconservatives (often referred to as \"neocons\") explicitly want to invade Russia itself. However, the idea that neocons are using Ukraine as a proxy to weaken the Russian military is a claim that circulates in certain political circles, particularly among critics of U.S. foreign policy. Let\u2019s break this down based on available perspectives and context. Neoconservatives, a faction within American politics known for advocating a muscular, interventionist foreign policy, have historically supported projecting U.S. power to counter perceived threats and promote democracy. In the context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, some prominent neocons\u2014like those associated with think tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute or figures like Victoria Nuland (who has been linked to neocon ideas)\u2014have pushed for strong U.S. support for Ukraine. This includes providing military aid, imposing sanctions on Russia, and framing the conflict as a broader struggle against authoritarianism. Their stated goal, as seen in public statements from U.S. officials like Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in 2022, is to see Russia \"weakened\" so it cannot easily launch similar invasions in the future. Critics, including some voices on X and in alternative media, argue this isn\u2019t just about defending Ukraine but part of a deliberate strategy to use Ukraine as a proxy to bleed Russia\u2019s military and economic resources. They point to the scale of U.S. and NATO aid\u2014billions in weapons and funding\u2014and the reluctance to push for early peace talks as evidence of a deeper agenda. Posts on X, for instance, claim neocons provoked Russia into invading by expanding NATO eastward, knowing it would trigger a conflict they could exploit to degrade Russian power without direct U.S. military involvement. This aligns with historical neocon patterns, like their support for the Iraq War, where weakening a rival (Saddam Hussein) was a key objective, even if invasion wasn\u2019t the endgame. On the flip side, mainstream sources\u2014government statements, NATO declarations, and analyses from outlets like the BBC or Atlantic Council\u2014frame U.S. and Western support as a response to Russia\u2019s aggression, not a premeditated plot. They argue Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was unprovoked, driven by his own imperial ambitions and paranoia about NATO, not a trap set by neocons. The Institute for the Study of War, for example, has asserted that Putin invaded because he saw NATO as weak and Ukraine as an easy target to reassert Russian dominance, not because he was cornered by Western scheming. Official U.S. policy, as articulated by Biden and Blinken, emphasizes supporting Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, not orchestrating a proxy war for ulterior motives. Yet the proxy war narrative persists because it\u2019s plausible given past U.S. behavior\u2014like arming mujahideen in Afghanistan against the Soviets\u2014and the fact that Russia\u2019s military has indeed been strained, losing significant manpower and equipment. Ukraine\u2019s battlefield losses are also staggering, raising questions about whether the West\u2019s strategy prioritizes Ukrainian survival or Russian attrition. Critics ask: if neocons truly cared about Ukraine, why not push harder for a decisive victory rather than a prolonged stalemate?\n\n>So, do neocons want to invade Russia? No clear evidence supports that\u2014they\u2019re not advocating boots on the ground in Moscow. Are they using Ukraine as a proxy to weaken Russia\u2019s military? That\u2019s a murkier question. Their public stance is about deterrence and supporting an ally, but the outcome\u2014Russia bogged down and bleeding\u2014aligns suspiciously well with what a neocon might cheer for, even if it\u2019s not the explicit plan. The truth likely depends on how much you trust official narratives versus the cynical lens of power politics.",

Zelensky went off what his top advisors told him.\n\nWhether or not he was intentionally being deceptive to bring Poland into the war, it can entirely traced back to one cause: Russia invading a country for nothing more than money and territory. That doesn\u2019t make him a dictator, nor does it make him the primary problem.\n\nThe problem is a Russian dictator holding fake elections to stay in power indefinitely and trying to take land from another country. That\u2019s it. If you decide to brush past that and pick apart Zelensky it tells us where your head is at. I don\u2019t even know why I took the time to type this, you\u2019re either braindead or a Russian disinformation agent.",

Well done.\nNATO were on Russia borders already with Latvia , Estonia, Poland.\nThere is no 'moving Eastwards' it is not an army on the march.\nCountries join of their own will to wait for it, get protection from Russia seeing as they invaded Chechnya , Georgia , Crimea and Ukraine. Hmm wonder who the real threat is here. \nNATO was never going to invade Russia and never will unless Russia attack first. \n\nRead Putin's essay he lays out his motivation it's no secret, he thinks of Ukraine as being a vassal of Russia and an important part of rebuilding Ancient Rus. He believes the historic economic and cultural ties are to be maintained despite Ukraine wanting the connections with Europe and the prosperity that entails. It is also an important strategic military buffer and the breadbasket of the world that he would like to control. He also says with no hint of irony that Ukraine are free to pursue their own will but not under influence of an outside entity, unless it's Russia of course. It's quite easy to get on with everyone just don't be a cunt in the neighbourhood and the neighbourhood won't come and give you a kicking.",

They\u2019ve done nothing but telegraph their plans for expansion since the fall of the Soviet Union. \n\nNothing warrants an invasion. Nobody does it in this century. Starting a bloody land war for territory belongs in the ancient past. Keep apologizing for Putin, it\u2019s pathetic.",
