You can just go on PubMed and look stuff up if you have specific questions.\n\nPointing out trends in data is not a blind assertion, and no one said it\u2019s 100% safe because nothing is 100% safe, that\u2019s not realistic for literally anything. The food you eat kills you. The sun gives you cancer. But significantly lowering risk of infection with low chances for side effects is worthwhile if it helps the population achieve herd immunity.",
