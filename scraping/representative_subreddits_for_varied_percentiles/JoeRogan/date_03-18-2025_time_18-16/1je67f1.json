What they don't realize is that this says far more about they themselves than it does about anyone else.",

What that turns into is a lot of paternalistic people wanting someone else to solve things they perceive as injustice or suffering without themselves having to lift a finger, while ignoring the damage that it does. They oftentimes assign the alleviation of that suffering to a government agency, or non profit with government funding, and can feel good about doing something even though they\u2019ve accomplished nothing. \n\nAs an example, people who empathize with the homeless and want the government to solve homelessness, but never show up at soup kitchens and the like to actually help these people. It leads to things like the homeless industrial complex. \n\nTo me, this isn\u2019t actually empathy, it\u2019s ego, but society labels it as empathy because there is technically someone at the end of their caring rainbow, even though that same \u201cempathic\u201d person would call the cops on that same homeless person if for setting up a tent in their local park.\n\nI\u2019m all for empathy, but not for fake empathy. By observing people\u2019s behaviors rather than their actions, I notice a lot more of the fake kind than the genuine kind.",

It leads to things like the homeless industrial complex.\n\nIf someone is a teacher and they have to work on lesson plans and grading over the weekend, does that disqualify them from being able to ask for and vote for more services for homeless people? What if that same teacher *does* have time to volunteer at a shelter on weekends- do they lose the ability to advocate for environmental causes?\n\nNo single person is capable of acting on everything they care about- that's a pretty fundamental feature of society.\n\n>They oftentimes assign the alleviation of that suffering to a government agency, or non profit with government funding, and can feel good about doing something even though they\u2019ve accomplished nothing\n\nWe do this for everything. Roads, food safety regulations, medical research, and so on. Weird to single out social supports. Efficiency and efficacy are a challenge, but even so, the \"accomplished nothing\" part is overly reductive. Shelter programs focus on the fundamental issue of preventing people dying from exposure on the streets. That's important work, even though it \"doesn't get us anywhere\". Other nonprofits work on pushing for housing reform, that alone \"doesn't solve the problem\" but it's a crucial piece of it. Other nonprofits provide free legal representation for homeless people. Others work with local governments to prevent eviction whenever possible, preventing homelessness upstream.\n\nIt's so damn easy to say nothing works and nothing's worth doing. We live in complex systems with complex issues that require complex solutions.",

I'm sure someone looks like a lazy asshole if they never give money to the homeless or volunteer at a shelter, but the reality is that they could do those things day in and day out for their entire lives and do *nothing* of importance to address the systemic issue of homelessness.\n\nHell, they could open and run a shelter for the rest of their life and they would still only be treating the symptoms and not the root causes. At some point, the only way to push for change is to be loud and to put pressure on the legal and political system.\n\nDemanding that your government address the issue (and more importantly, voting for politicians who support your views) IS civic engagement. Asking them to lean on the rich to do so IS civic engagement. That's how things work in our form of representative democracy - people prioritize certain issues, then provide support (generally through taxes) to people who live that work day in and day out. It doesn't really matter if they're an asshole, individually.\n\nAll of this falls out the window if you don't vote, but in that scenario you're not a serious person regardless of views or opinions.",

You don't have to be jealous to recognize we live in a society that does not provide a level playing field for participants. \n\nYou talk as if the free market would naturally take care of suffering if it weren't for the meddlesome government, but those are two sides of the same coin. The government keeps private enterprise in check and supplements where it falls short. It's not theft for the government to levy taxes. Private enterprise is often only motivated by profit, this leads to a cruel society that provides increasingly worse products for more money over time, leading to huge wealth disparities. I don't propose that the government eliminates that disparity just that they fill the gaps left by that disparity. An impoverished populace doesn't make for very good consumers. The government's taxes are essentially shoring up the consumer base to keep big business afloat. And yeah, they're doing it with the tax revenue from the folks who have profited the most from said businesses. Could the government be better stewards of our tax money? Of course, but business could also be better stewards of the money we pay them, but the apparatus that attempts to solve for that is the government.",
