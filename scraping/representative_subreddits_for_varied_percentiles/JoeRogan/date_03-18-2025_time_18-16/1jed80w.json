Both just result in him requiring more mental bandwidth from his conversation partner (and audience) to say something in a way that adds time while not reducing complexity. When he was one hour into his JRE episode on UFOs and he said \u201cokay, now let\u2019s bring this back to the UFOs\u201d I almost did a spit take, because *THAT WAS THE QUESTION JOE OPENED THE EPISODE WITH AND HE STILL HAD NOT ANSWERED IT*\n\nLet me give you an example. Are you familiar with the game of Centrifugal Bumble-Puppy? Of course you\u2019re not. Centrifugal bumble-puppy is a game in Aldous Huxley\u2019s Brave New World whereby the players have to throw balls into a massive cylindrical contraption, which then tosses the balls out randomly for the kids to catch. Centrifugal Bumble-Puppy was designed by the Controllers to ensure that their citizens continued to purchase consumer goods on convoluted games that required lots of moving parts and contraptions that couldn\u2019t be easily fabricated by hand. Like Weinstein, Centrifugal Bumble-Puppy intentionally makes itself as complicated and overwrought as possible in order to extract as much out of its subjects as it possibly can.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0(/s, in case it isn\u2019t obvious I\u2019m just doing a Weinstein thing, but this is EXACTLY how he does analogies).",
