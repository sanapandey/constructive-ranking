For real, seems like the only question is whether he will be overt or not.

People should look into Bernie if they have never done so and you will know what people mean when they say things like that. Joe used to tell us the same before some huge amount of money apparently came his way from, well, he doesn't care which country, because the money is just as green.",

Secondly, please do tell me the last company that was bailed out by the government.  This isn't 2008 any longer and if you want to really use anything that happened during COVID when the whole country forcibly closed down by said government you are going to have to do better than that.  Subsidies are done for economic purposes with the plan that those subsidies will drive more revenue in for the government than what they would have gotten through taxes.  Taxes are an expense to a business and if the government can help by preventing roadblocks in regard to economic growth then it is a win win for society as a whole.  More jobs, new money creation in the economy and more funds brought into the federal government.\n\n>Most democrats don\u2019t like breaking the law. Fucking with dealerships is illegal.

You speak of PPP loans and the lack of oversight, I hope you have that same energy for the billions that have been sent over to Ukraine.  One of the biggest sticking points for the GOP and that funding has been, guess what? Lack of oversight of where the money is going.  Furthermore, the democrats spent more time, taxpayer dollars and weaponizing the government agencies in ensuring that bad orange man didn't become president that they forgot about the American people.

I don't need to take a step back.  Regardless of the accountability, I didn't agree with any of it, but it needed to be done because businesses were shut down forcibly and not by their own accord.  You can't go and shut down the economy and then tell people to figure it out own their own.  What the PPP did was just show how incompetent the government is because of how bloated and inefficient that they are.\n\n>Look it up - it\u2019s all out there. For shutting down cities - shit like that happens during a collective health even. Do you know anyone who died?

God forbid the dems don't try to grab on whatever they could to get Trump to look bad, but prominent politicians like Pelosi protesting on the streets at the beginning of the pandemic to scream against that racist Trump for wanting to put in a travel ban on China. Better yet, you know for one of worst viruses ever they had no problem with allowing people to protest on the streets for George Floyd, that was too important to not allow......

I'm just simply pointing out the hypocrisy in your statements regarding oversight.  No, we just didn't send them missiles, they received cash and other advanced military equipment, intelligence etc.  It wasn't just expired missles and you are ignorant as all hell if that is what you actually believe.  Go do some research.  \n\nUkraine had a coup in 2014 in which we absolutely had our hands in so let's not sit here and act like we are completely innocent in all of this.  That doesn't give Russia the right to do what they did and continue to do but Jesus, at least understand geopolitical issues before you just start spouting the same old cliche shit that is used ad nauseum.  \n\nWe can all agree that Putin is a POS while at the same time understanding that we absolutely instigated shit, that we get involved in shit overseas that has impact beyond just the localized area that we may be operating in and that our adversaries aren't going to just sit back and accept whatever we do near their realm of influence.

I can absolutely point out where Trump is an idiot and it would be nice if he would just STFU. However, I have to accept some of his stupidity with the positives that he brings to the table.  The point is rather than just allowing Trump to potentially bury himself with some of the things he says, instead most of the left absolutely loses their minds and do everything that they can to one up him.  In the process of doing so, they take more extreme actions, sound and look way more foolish than he original did, and then they all double down on it.\n\nI mean the democratic party literally nominated a vegetable as president.  They all knew he was not in proper health to be in the position to begin with but literally lied to themselves and the public by saying that he was very cognitive and sharp as a knife.  Then, 5-6 months until the election they kicked him to the curb and then nominated the worst candidate you could think of to replace the vegetable they just told to take a seat all while not allowing the very people who support this deranged party a voice in electing her as candidate. The crazy part? A shit ton of people supported that action without hesitation. All just to stop one guy.

However the executive branch is still the authority to manage the executive responsibilities. The idea that Congress approves the expenditures is only partially true. They basically approve the initiative but each line item is not reviewed by Congress, especially when it comes to NGOs.  The executive definitely has the authority to prevent payments if they do not fall within the mandate. For example, if Congress approves $100,000 for building maintenance, and then one of the payments is $50,000 for watering five plants, would you not say that is a waste? Because it would be an expenditure that Congress did not review. I made that example up but there is one contract that was canceled that was $56,000 to water eight plants.",

Am I comfortable with it being him? I think there is some confusion regarding his authority. He's allowed to make recommendations. The Senate approved appointments are the people that actually execute based on those recommendations.  I do know is that cutting down the deficit and eventually the debt must be done otherwise the country will crash in about 15 years. There's not an economist that disagrees. Every single administration has had reports showing tons of waste. This is the first administration that has actually tried to do something about it. The reality is we all know there is corruption and waste in the government. I don't know if anyone making the cuts would get positive press. But I do know it has to be done. Whatever mistakes are made should get fixed up and hopefully the government runs more efficiently after that. I don't think anyone could make the cuts smoothly without complaints.",

But let's say the country brings in $100 a year. And it spends $150. And we currently have a debt of $1,000. Because we only bring in 100 and we spend $150, we run a deficit of $50. That $50 has to get added to our debt every year. In addition interest builds on our debt. The money that has been cut so far is not enough to cover that $50 deficit. So the debt still remains untouched while interest builds and it continues to get bigger because we also have to add the remainder of that $50 to the debt because we are borrowing more every year.  Ideally, we budget the money equally and we spend less than what we take in. So essentially you don't pay down a deficit as you referred it is more that you don't spend in excess of what you take in. After balancing the budget, the only way to get ahead from that point is to create more income and growth so that instead of bringing in $100 a year you make more. To pay the current debt would be damn near impossible but to grow out of it there is a better chance.",

I doubt lithium ion batteries were in everything like they are today. Technology had to advance to a point were lithiums potential could be utilized. It's reasonable to assume that there are other resources that will avail themselves in the future. Feeding hungry kids in bumfuck nowhere right now could give us preferable trade deals, mining rights, opportunities at a future date. It doesn't really cost us much. The food that's given to these hungry places are bought from American farmers and goes to a good cause and could yield something profitable in the future. Or maybe it's not raw materials. Maybe it's political capital. Or maybe, end of the day, it doesn't produce anything useful. You still fed hungry kids. This also includes other social programs, medicine, education. Our economy is fucking gigantic. $30trln a year. We can afford to help people. \n\n Some of this aid is used for propaganda purposes which I'm not opposed to either. The Chinese spend crazy amounts on propaganda. The Russians do too. If you want to take a moral position in saying we shouldn't be doing this, you're allowed. You're also ceding any goodwill that may have been gained to the Chinese and Russians and make no mistake these countries consider us their enemies.",

The leadership looked like idiots, and so did the bro's cheering we would kick ass and take names and have an economic golden age. Fast forward eight years, and they blamed everything on the black guy and say he started the war on terror, and now none of them will admit supporting the dumb shit in 2008.\n\nTen years from now, half of these people won't admit they supported Trump anymore. Even Joe will be saying 'I was skeptical but I wanted to give him a chance' or 'Well he had this huge opportunity but he trusted the wrong people.' A good chunk of MAGA, by 2030, will be saying Trump was a Democrat in the 90's and a secret Democrat now and it was obvious he was a pedo, but he tricked everyone. And then after trillions more in bailouts and mass layoffs, they'll blame whoever takes over to clean up the mess in 2028 or, God help us, 2032.",

Biggest thing is people lost all trust in government and their institutions. \n\nThere is no more due process. No more law. If you can round up a bunch of people, throw them on a plane and fly them to Gitmo or El Salvador, and there is nothing anyone can do about it - then how fast do you think they will do that to people who are not \u00ab\u00a0aligned with their vision\u00a0\u00bb before anyone can bat an eye?\n\nFor us, looking at you from the outside, we just can\u2019t believe what we are seeing.
