No, they're both the same, each just doing different narratives and things to achieve the same goal: get to power and do anything to stay in power. Like the fact that people like you can't comprehend how human ideals always works in favor of greed is just laughable, and there's tons of examples in history, and it never fails to be proven.\n\nSo what should we strive for? Simple, a middle term, with ideas and methodologies from both sides and not a full blown revolution/restructuring that might give too much power for one or the other, we should strive for dialogue and open discussion but also with respectful disagreement, and to stop vilyfing other people for disagreeing with you politically, because at the end of the day we're all humans and most likely than not you have more in common with who you consider your enemy than you think.",

The people who would have legit criticisms are going to be more quiet and/or drowned out by the actual attacks and harassment. \n\nYes and no. There are two factors here. The first is that the harassment always gets more *attention.* If you have ten posts, and nine are legitimate criticism, and one is something racist and personal, then that latter one will be all anyone cares about, and the headline will be \"devs being harassed by racists,\" rather than \"people really don't seem to like this game.\" \n\nThe second part is that not all legitimate criticism is *quality* criticism, that is, it's not well explained or constructive in nature. If someone says \"I don't like this aspect of the game, here are many reasons why... here is how you could have done it differently...,\" then that is certainly a more quality criticism than \"this game sucks,\" but the later post is no less *valid* a criticism, and should still be taken into consideration as expressing the position of one individual. \n\nI think that collecting an analyzing criticism involves both collecting the \"volume\" of it, how many people liked or disliked a certain aspect, and then to secondarily try and figure out *why* based on the more detailed responses. \n\n>Example: 'i dont like thing and heres why' versus 'this fucking sucks and who made it is stupid' is a big leap for me in most cases.\n\nI think that \"and who made it is stupid\" crosses the line, but \"this fucking sucks\" is a valid opinion. \n\n>And you can tell by the downvotes on comments about 'just leave the people alone', most people don't know to articulate themselves and would rather be jerks.\n\nI think most of that comes down to people just being tired of people who make such sentiments. It's unhelpful and spreads reductive stereotypes.",

Every historical event was a lie and religions were created by users of the apple?\n\nYes. \n\nI get the impression that you aren't understanding my point. \n\nMy point is not that I believe that these things did happen, and certainly not that our history *recorded* these events as happening. The conceit of the franchise, however, is that these events *might* have happened in the history as we know it, that they don't *conflict* with how history worked. While there were \"alien apples,\" those alien apples were used subtly in the background, not boldly in public, so it's *possible* that those things actually happened and were simply lost to history. When events are way too out of step with known history, it breaks that core fiction.",

The point is that *in canon* the artifact was not necessarily used in public at all, and if it was, the effects it had would have been too vague to make the history books. It's not something that would obviously contradict the historical narrative, like say Napoleon flying into London in an airship or something.",

He appeared to be twenty-six or twenty-seven years old. Black over his whole body, just like an ox, this man looked robust and had a good demeanor. What is more, his formidable strength surpassed that of ten men. The Bateren brought him along by way of paying his respects to Nobunaga. Indeed, it was owing to Nobunaga's power and his glory that yet unheard-of treasures from the Three Countries and curiosities of this kind came to be seen here time and again, a blessing indeed\n\nand then later\n\n> It was ordered that the young black man be given a stipend (\u6276\u6301, fuchi), named Yasuke, and provided with a sword (\u3055\u3084\u5dfb, sayamaki), and a private residence. At times, he was also entrusted with carrying the master's weapons.\n\nFather Louren\u00e7o Mex\u00eda  later wrote \n\n> The black man understood a little Japanese, and Nobunaga never tired of talking with him. And because he was strong and had a few skills, Nobunaga took great pleasure in protecting him and had him roam around the city of Kyoto with an attendant. Some people in the town said that Nobunaga might make him as tono (\"lord\"). \n\n\nThe Ietada Diary of Matsudaira Ietada, a vassal of Tokugawa Ieyasu, mentions that Yasuke accompanied Nobunaga on his inspection tour of the region after he destroyed his long-time arch-enemy, the Takeda clan of Kai.\n\n > Nobunaga-sama was accompanied by a black man who was presented to him by the missionaries and to whom he gave a stipend. His body was black like ink and he was 6 shaku 2 bu [182.4 cm or near 6 feet] tall. His name was said to be Yasuke. \n\n\n2 separate reliable Japanese accounts refer to him and 2 reliable Christian Missionary accounts, neither of whom were British, refer to him, its not a huge amount about the man but its enough to say he existed",

There were a lot of people moaning that it was endorsing colonialism, and giving Vikings a heroic treatment that they didn't deserve.\n\nI remember this, because I remember thinking that this was a weird thing to complain about in a series where you play as a member of the Hashishin, who were the original suicide bombers - they were *not* heroic fighters for the underdog, they were terrorists.  \n\nShowing a group in a different light than how they were in real life is baked into the very premise of the series.",

They meant the difference is it's a black guy in a Japanese setting instead of a white guy. You didn't have these complaints when the guy was white, you do when he's black. Pretty clear what the difference is.",

If you don't like the game, just don't buy it. In fact, I think not being so vocal about your negativity and then the game flopping will hurt the company even more, because they won't be anticipating the game sales shitting the bed as much.\n\nFrankly apart from Valhalla, I've quite enjoyed all of the AC games for what they are. Are the open worlds games good AC games? Nah, but they are great RPG's albeit a little grindy at times. I'm sure Shadows will be a fun game, even if it isn't the most historically accurate. But that's never really been their schtick. They have some historically accurate elements and lore, but there is fuckin magic in the games.",
