YouTube viewers expect way overproduced high quality content or pure low effort stuff today, and his sat firmly in the middle. \n\nIt also left him vulnerable, in the sense that he's learning about the game as he's trying it, and no reviewer is willing to look clueless anymore.",

Having a first-looks and live reactions on game intros can work for a niche and I know it does because it's Iron Pineapple's schtick. Thing is, Total Biscuit did have a set of personal focuses with tackling games I just don't see anyone do. Or at least they don't do to the extent he did with it being consistently present in his other shows and podcasts. The only other person with a heavy handed persona(lity) and the capability to maintain it even throughout multiple things at once seems to be yahtzee, but he doesn't appeal to me too much.",
