Especially when the actual creators have stated they will be doing that.\n\nA case you are describing isn't typically trying to compete with the actual creator or cheapening the idea by riding off his coattails.\n\nI don't think this is complicated.

He claims they are breaking a non-compete and has an injunction against them, which is currently preventing them from working on their own project.\n\nMuch like many of those rushing to get a \"spiritual successor\" to DE out he's just another leech trying to ride the talents of others. Unfortunately, it seems to have worked. Given his love of AI I wouldn't be surprised if Hopetown ends up filled with AI slop. Worth noting he was at some point involved in another DE \"spiritual successor\" called XXX Nightshift.\n\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/after-suing-a-disco-elysium-writer-to-prevent-him-from-making-his-own-game-a-tech-ceo-whos-allegedly-banned-from-the-disco-elysium-subreddit-is-trying-to-crowdfund-a-spiritual-successor/\n\nHonestly Disco Elysium's fate at this point is so pitch perfectly in line with some of the themes of the game, that I'm half starting to wonder if this whole situation is elaborate performance art.",

Long ways out but I'm a patient man with a big backlog these days!\n\nEdit: See below for my take on all the drama. I'm not going to sit here and tell other people to put their money into it, because there's definitely sketchy scenarios around the DE team breakup and drama, but I'd still like to personally believe these people on this team will make a cool game going forward.",

Furthermore, **Ben Babbitt** and **Pawe\u0142 Blaszczak** certainly seem like they had nothing to do with that drama - are you suggesting they shouldn't have this chance to make a new game because of their co-creators being involved in some legal case that's way over all of our heads?\n\nI know the OG team broke apart and are having a big fight over the rights, I don't know enough to say who's in the \"wrong\" here about it, just that I choose to support creators trying to make interesting games. Everyone else can choose to be wrapped up in typical internet sanctimony if that's what they want to focus on.",

The idea they'll rely on AI for any major part of the game, why they're looking for extra funding for the game, and the actual contributions of what \"additional development\" means in the credits or how much any of these people did during development, who is \"right\" in the lawsuit/what's happening behind closed doors or what promises might've been made or broken during development, is all purely speculation as far as I can tell. The fact he's associated strongly with AI is of course going to get everyone's hate boner going against him and lean towards the speculation.\n\nI totally get why people wouldn't want to fund this and are skeptical. I'd personally like to believe the team can make a good game though.",
