That's how Grand Theft Auto was accidentally invented (it started out as a simple racing game like Micro Machines). Presumably, that's how the previous (and very good) Saint's Row games became what they did. Wild ideas and prototyping are where fun comes from. \n\nBut I still agree with you and the article that these days a product needs a plan, a finite budget, and discipline. Games are more expensive to make than ever before.",

So it's better if the game design itself is all prototyped out in Game Maker or something fast (or even physical board game parts), with \"programmer\" art or stock assets. And you have a tiny group mess around with that until it's good.\n\nNo game should get developed for years and then scrapped because they \"couldn't find the fun\" - that's ridiculous. Wasting millions of dollars and tons of artists' time. People can have fun with sticks and rocks. \n\nWhat I do know is music production, and the parallel in that is if you're smart, you'll work up your songs with just a basic rhythm and chord progressions and melodies using stock sounds, or a piano or guitar (or just humming!) first until that's good. And then you go making that sound nice, which is the part that can take a very long time. But if the basics aren't any good, you're just polishing a turd.",

It's not a \"Valve bad\" post, I think Valve is generally a good company, and certainly the best available steward of our game libraries, but as actual game *developers,* they are in full \"noodle mode,\" because they lack that need to actually make money off the games they work on. \n\n>If they didn't pivot as a business they might still be making games, why are you judging them for an alternative future that didn't happen?\n\nBecause the topic of conversation is \"game studios that lose sight of producing games.\"",

It would have had to be on the scale of GOOH then.\n\nGOOH was... weird. I mean I liked some aspects like hell being a monday center-of-town office area, perfect, and the singing, and stuff like that. But overall it felt like a huge waste. Much of the DLC for these games missed the target tone, too. It was only fun in the zany moments. Enter the Dominatrix as the in-universe slapstick making-of I can accept, but it ends there.\n\nShame.
