It is not that people are playing the good old games but rather that they\u2019re playing a bunch of live service titles that still get updates like Fortnite or World of Warcraft. I also wonder if there is such a thing as a mono gamer. Who basically plays one game or maybe a couple of games and only really spends a lot of time on one particular game. We know that there are sports fans who only really play the sports games but well they get new games every year so I guess they are technically playing new games.",

A further 25% of player hours were spent on games that were two to five years old, and the remaining 8% of time was spent on games that are less than two years old.\n\n>NewZoo's data further breaks down that 67% chunk. Within this:\n\n>7.1% of the total hours spent were on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive / Counter-Strike 2\n>6.4% were in League of Legends\n>6.2% were in Roblox\n>5.8% were in Dota 2\n>5.4% were in Fortnite\n\nHard to fault publishers chasing to be that forever game. I\u2019m sure GTA takes up a big chunk too.",

I feel like the \"we\" you are talking about is a vocal minority. And besides, free to play live action games honestly provide amazing value. People who like the game spend can spend money on it, and people who occasionally play them can play them for free. Of course that doesn't mean that every live service game is the best game of all time and most of them don't have tons of FOMO etc. But I remember when CoD used to release map packs as DLC. For a game that was \"replaced\" a year later anyway.",

We're at the point of getting very small incremental visual upgrades even generation to generation. Skyrim released 13-14 years ago and the graphics still hold up. GTA 5 released 11 years ago and the graphics still hold up.\n\nGames from ~25 years ago are getting re-released with mostly graphical updates and selling like hotcakes. I don't think it's because new games are 'bad' per se, but rather that the main selling point for years has been higher graphical fidelity with similar enough gameplay. \n\nMultiplayer games are dying so quickly because the majority of people making the jump from game to game at this point are just people who are serial game jumpers that don't stick with anything long term - playing mainly because of FOMO and cultural relevance, or being a part of a 'fresh' experience again.",

It's a combination of things.\n\nThe biggest one being as you play more and more games, you kind of figure out what you like and don't like. Modern games tend to appeal to a broader audience, so they tend to be more filled with aspects you don't like...so you tend to gravitate towards older stuff that you can tolerate.\n\nEvery once in a while though something new comes along and scratches that itch.\n\n-----\n\nAnother being friend groups/communities. I know ones I am a part of will kind of cycle through games, they'll be like \"Starting a Valehim server!\" Then everyone will jump on and put hundreds of hours in, then it will slowly fizzle out and people will just do their own thing, then someone will say \"starting a Conan Exiles server!\" and they'll keep cycling through games like that. New games happen to get added to the rotation, but old games keep going through.",

We're at the point of getting very small incremental visual upgrades even generation to generation. Skyrim released 13-14 years ago and the graphics still hold up.

Then I saw lets plays, and static NPCs that just stand there day and night as you're getting murdered.\n\nThis is something Oblivion from 2006 has figured out, and greatly adds to the immersion.\n\nSure, there's gems out there like KCD2 and BG3, but I have a feeling so many new games focus on things players don't care about, but either devs, marketing, or money people are asking for.",

I\u2019d say the last 5 to 10 years I\u2019ve been playing more and more older games as I have been finding that more of the newer games are progressively becoming worse. In the past six months I have bought a bunch of new games and I have hardly touched them. I am seriously rethinking my game purchasing habits. It seems more and more games are just not all that great now.",

Steam which is going to be used by what 99% of users only is down as 132 million users, so where they getting those numbers from? Can't be just adding pcs cause there are billions so that number is random. \n\nThen this seems to be a survey of only 73k users?

It's why I've stayed away from Civ7 so far.\n\nAnd not to mention that my Steam games are now voluminous, so that I need to start trying some of them.\n\nListen, life got in the way.  I had to finish college, got married, got a demanding job, got a house and kids, moved a few times, have to take care of older family members more, Cub Scouts is a thing, then regular Scouts, some volunteer stuff around my neighborhood, I like trying new recipes with the kids, keeping up socially with my friends, school matters with the kids...
