It's a great game to play solo with plenty of farming, definitely plays better with at least one friend.\n\nAside from that, trackmania 2020 always gets some play time. There's not much to say other than it's an occasionally buggy masterpiece",

I felt tense the whole time, always on the edge of 0 ammo and 0 health, always lost as hell traversing the station. Maybe it was playing on hard difficulty. Near the end I cheated with unlimited ammo/psi and easy difficulty but by then i was already burned out on it.",

            "body": "Finished FF XVI last month. Really enjoyed it. Awesome set pieces, story, action etc. Side quests were very basic, almost MMO like but they would always complete very, very quickly (most within 5min). The gear/blacksmith-system really could've all been scrapped and replaced by finding cool swords in cutscenes instead and it would have made no difference. Still overall I never got bored and enjoyed every second of it.\n\nAlso Finished Mafia 3 in these last 2 weeks. While I enjoyed the characters and cutscenes, the gameplay was really boring. You basicaly take over district by district but you do the exact same missions over and over. There aren't even any enemy types to speak of, so it gets really really boring. And a lot of times, you have to clear the same \"place\" twice. So lets say the first mission in a district is a church - you clear that place when you get there to intergate some person for info on the leader. Then you grind away to \"unlock\" the \"boss\" fight, and it takes place in the same church! This happened for several districts for me. Felt really low quality at times. Hoping the new upcoming game is much better than this.\n\nGame is also very broken in 2025. I had to block it from the internet with the built in windowsfirewall so the game doesnt crash when \"connecting\" to something. The game will force your monitor into 60Hz in fullscreen (does NOT support borderless), you have to use janky mods to get it to run at proper Hz (see PCGamingWiki). It would crash at random (\\~6-8 times during playthrough). Some missions would get soft-locked (load from checkpoint fixed them).\n\nYesterday I started my playthrough of Ghost of Tsushima. So far very impressed and enjoying it. Really liking the combat.",

It actually feels like a weight has been lifted, as it frees up my backlog quite a bit.\n\nIn my opinion, Sekiro, while a very *good* game, is an overrated game and, in its one-dimensional grind, stands out from the rest of the FromSoft catalogue, which features more optionality in stats and gameplay.\n\nNext up Dark Souls Remastered",
