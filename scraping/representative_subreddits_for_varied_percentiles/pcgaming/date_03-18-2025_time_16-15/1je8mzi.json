No bloatware, no middlemen, no launchers, no DRM, no nothing. And yes, if you're so desperate to phone home back to Valve, you can add it to Steam anyway, GOG isn't stopping you as the game is yours.\n\nGet used to it, I've been watching games get sold exclusively on Steam for years, surely this will be a nothingburger for you.\n\n**.........Now back to the actual topic:**\n\nI hope we do get to know the pricing information soon, though I hope the 35GBs space and 16GBs requirements aren't hard rules given, well, it doesn't seem like the kind of game to require them, but at this point I'm willing to look over that. I've never played the original game but it seems like my taste in 3D platformers, with colorful environments a fun vibe too. Looking forward to it.\n\nNow back to staying logged out of Reddit.",
