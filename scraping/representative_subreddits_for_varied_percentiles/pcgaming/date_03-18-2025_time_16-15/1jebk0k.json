I got it on day one to support the devs, played around 25 hours, and decided to wait till it improves. \n\nI am a huge fan of STALKER and it really lives up only to one thing, it being JDALKER(Jdal = to wait).\n\nWait for shaders to finish caching every time you start the game. Ah, and also wait for them to improve the game. Sucks to say all this but that's the truth.",
