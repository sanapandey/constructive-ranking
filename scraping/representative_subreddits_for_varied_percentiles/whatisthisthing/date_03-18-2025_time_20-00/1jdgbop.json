    "selftext": "This photo is circulating the internet and was supposedly taken during the last protests in Belgrade, Serbia. While hundreds of thousands of people were gathered in silence to pay respect to fifteen people who died in November last year, a phantom sound was heard reportedly resembling that of a speeding car, a jet, a herd of horses that put people in panic and made them clear a large street in seconds, splitting into two leaving an empty space in the middle. Various people are describing effects reportedly consistent with the use of LARD. This photo was allegedly taken moments before the incident a few hundred meters down the street. Van someone shed a light as to what this black thing on the right is?",

There are youtube videos of people demonstrating what this is like on a small home made hobby scale. A powerful device could likely accomplish what you describe, but again, I don't know what it would look like or if it could be this.",
