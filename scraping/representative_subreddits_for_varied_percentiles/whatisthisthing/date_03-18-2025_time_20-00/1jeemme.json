In this whole display, not a single item is labeled or described neither inside or outside the glass case. The most detail provided is \u201cTools of St.Louis\u201d on the glass. My maternal family side works with and sells antiques and are also unsure of its use. Help, please! We\u2019re going insane trying to figure this out.",

            "body": "It's a water elevator, sometimes called a chain pump.  They were used to draw water up a short vertical distance from a cistern or shallow well.  There's a chain that goes up the inside of the front column, over the wheel, and down the back column.  In the front column it runs inside a water pipe that extends down into the cistern.  The chain has round piston-like things (I believe these were called buckets though they are not bucket-shaped) spliced in every few feet that fit snugly inside the pipe, sometimes with leather seals.  As the handle or wheel are turned the chain is pulled up and the water comes up the pipe with it.\n\nWater elevators could be used to draw up a good deal of water with relatively little effort while keeping the cistern or well more or less sealed against contamination (the top cover for this one is missing).  Later housings were made of sheet metal rather than wood.  They were simpler and more reliable than early piston pumps, and easier to repair -- but more bulky and could not accommodate horizontal runs.\n\nIt's also possible that this machine originally used rope rather than chain.",
