The slit extends into the head. It's hollowed through the shaft and up into the head. It's shy. Likes long walks on the beach. Lots of dents and dings. The numbers 28 crudely stamped into the eared indention in the head. \nCopper or brass, according to my metal detector and the look. Found near an 1800s farm house in Arkansas. Poor people. They had a well nearby. I can literally not think of a single other thing to add about this item.",
