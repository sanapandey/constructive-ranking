He has also been very strongly prounion. Despite taking over a horrible situation in terms of the pandemic and the economy, the administration weathered it much better than the world and created new jobs. Yes, they didn't solve every single issue but they laid the platform for building on. Kamala was very vocal about addressing the housing crisis. \n\nBut people like you seem to care only about optics. She had a republican on stage for a few speeches. So she must be centrist. They didn't get Liz Cheney because they made some deals or included some centrist ideas in the campaign. She literally said she doesn't agree with most of the campaign proposals but Trump is an existential threat. \n\nI'm not saying that the Palestinian protestors lost the election. A lot of centrists who voted for Dems voted for Trump because of the prices. The point is that they vote though. It is easier to convince someone who regularly votes to vote for you than to get someone to come and vote. If that 2% centrists in swing states went for Dems, they would have had the house and the white house. \n\n Progressives are shooting themselves in the foot by not voting because the politicians actually cater to people who vote. Dems will come back with stronger immigration and economy while ignoring more progressive ideas because that's where the electorate is. Progressives need to be a significant electorate. They need to convince politicians that the 2% centrists in swing states can easily be overcome by progressive votes in those states. Otherwise, the country is doomed.",

Progressives aren\u2019t a significant electorate and you shouldn\u2019t cater to us? Fine, go for it. But the moment the election is lost, the conversation immediately becomes \u201cwhy didn\u2019t the progressive arm of the party do more!!!\u201d You don\u2019t get to do both. You don\u2019t get to ignore us for 3 years and then blame this loss on us, this was you and your inability to wrangle the \u201cpeople who actually vote\u201d. Which is even more embarrassing because I guess Liz Cheney publicly disagreeing with the platform but still smiling on stage didn\u2019t do much to swing many votes.\n\nAnd I know you aren\u2019t specifically saying that; but that is what the original poster I\u2019m replying to is saying.",

Hamas claimed Israel didn\u2019t lift the blockade fully; Israel said Hamas failed to halt militants, leading to Operation Cast Lead (1,400 Palestinians, 13 Israelis killed).  \n\n2. 2012 Ceasefire: After Operation Pillar of Defense, rocket fire dropped but resumed sporadically (e.g., 40 rockets in early 2013), prompting Israeli reprisals.\n\n3. 2014 Ceasefire: Post-Operation Protective Edge, Hamas agreed to stop attacks, but rockets persisted (e.g., August 2014 violations during talks), though some were from smaller factions. Over 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis died in the war.  \n\n4. 2025 Ceasefire: Phase Two negotiations stalled. Israel claims Hamas has not released additional hostages as agreed, per posts on X and news reports (e.g., stalled talks cited in early 2025). Hamas alleges Israel hasn\u2019t honored commitments like fully lifting restrictions, though specifics remain disputed. \n\nPost-Gaza takeover, Hamas-led or tolerated rocket attacks disrupted ceasefires repeatedly. Counting major truce breakdowns (2008, 2012, 2014, 2021, 2023 escalation, 2025 delays), this could range from 6\u201315 incidents, depending on whether minor violations or only war-triggering breaches are included.  \n\nThere\u2019s more than I listed but I listed some highlights.
