Btw it clearly says in the 4th paragraph of the article that the vehicle hit the light post sideways and split in half from the side.\n\nLight posts are built to breakaway at the base when hit by a vehicle, but they aren\u2019t built to breakaway when hit going highway speeds. My friend\u2019s brother hit a light post racing in his jaguar back in the mid 2000\u2019s, police estimated he hit the light post at about 60-70mph, and at those speeds the pole is being hit with so much force all at once that it doesn\u2019t breakaway instead the vehicle splits before the pole can breakaway.\n\nThe friend\u2019s brother actually wasn\u2019t dead on impact, both his lungs collapsed and he died from that and his injuries very shortly after the crash, (just like the article explains happened to this officer) but he didn\u2019t die right at the time of impact.",

This tactic is evident in how authoritarian regimes justify violence and deny responsibility for human rights abuses.\n\n1. Justifying Authoritarian Violence: \"The Enemy Within\"\n\nAuthoritarian regimes often portray dissenting groups as threats to the state, framing violent actions as necessary self-defense.\n\n * In Nazi Germany, systematic dehumanization of Jewish people, Roma, and political opponents portrayed them as threats to national purity and security, justifying violence as national preservation.\n\n * During the Stalinist purges, propaganda depicted \"enemies of the people\" as saboteurs and spies, rationalizing mass arrests and executions.\nKey linguistic techniques employed include:\n\n * Passive voice: Shifting focus away from the perpetrator, e.g., \"Counter-revolutionary elements were eliminated.\"\n\n * Dehumanizing language: Stripping targeted groups of their humanity using terms like \"vermin\" or \"parasites.\"\n\n * Appeals to fear: Emphasizing the perceived threat to national security or social order.\n\n * Claiming necessity: Asserting that actions are essential for state safety.\n\n2. Obscuring Responsibility: \"It Just Happened\"\nAuthoritarian regimes often deny or minimize their role in human rights abuses, portraying events as accidental or inevitable.\n \n* The Chinese government's response to the Tiananmen Square massacre involved portraying protests as a \"counter-revolutionary rebellion\" and minimizing casualties, while emphasizing the military's \"heroic actions.\"\n\n * Police departments use language that removes the officer from the action, e.g., \"The suspect sustained injuries during an altercation.\"\nLinguistic techniques used to obscure responsibility:\n \n* Passive voice: Shifting focus away from the actor, e.g., \"Injuries were sustained.\"\n \n* Euphemisms: Using vague language to describe violence, e.g., \"collateral damage.\"\n \n* Blaming the victim: Portraying victims as responsible for their suffering.\n\n * Focusing on procedure: Emphasizing protocol adherence, even when harmful.\n\n * Naturalizing the event: Describing events as if they were forces of nature.\n\nIn both cases, propaganda aims to control the narrative, deflecting responsibility and justifying violence to maintain power and suppress dissent.\n\n * Reliance on Police Narratives:\n\n   * News outlets frequently rely heavily on police press releases and official statements as primary sources. This can lead to the uncritical repetition of police narratives, even before independent verification.\n\n   * For example, initial news reports on police-involved shootings often present the police version of events without sufficient context or alternative perspectives.\n\n * Emphasis on \"Heroic\" Actions:\n\n   * News segments often highlight stories of police officers performing acts of kindness or bravery, such as rescuing people from danger or helping those in need. While these stories are not inherently negative, they can create a skewed image of policing by overshadowing reports of misconduct.\n\n * \"Crime Surge\" Narratives:\n \n  * Media outlets sometimes amplify claims of \"crime surges\" or rising crime rates, often sourced from police departments. These narratives can create a sense of fear and justify increased police presence or more aggressive policing tactics, even when data may not fully support the claims.\n\n * Use of Police-Provided Footage:\n \n  * News stations often use footage provided by police departments, such as body camera footage or surveillance video. This allows police to control the visual narrative and potentially exclude footage that portrays them in a negative light.\n\n * The \"Bad Apple\" Defense in Reporting:\n \n  * When police misconduct occurs, news reports sometimes frame it as the actions of a \"few bad apples,\" rather than a systemic problem. This approach can minimize the need for broader police reform.\n\n * Social media manipulation:\n\n   * Police departments are now very active on social media. They will post very positive interactions with the public, and try to create a very positive image of the department. This is very common, and can be used to distract from negative news.",

Vehicle property crimes should have an add-on mandatory punishment (some sort of community service, probably) that does something to offset it, or at least be widely published/advertised, so it discourages potential perps, if possible. \n\nPolice ultimately do, in aggregate, maintain order, and are a small part of what keeps society from disintegrating under all the chaotic influences of those who decide for whatever reason to F up.",

So it would technically be possible, in theory, for someone to be charged with gross negligence if the pole should have been a break-away design.",

We don't know the speeds of the pursuit and conditions of traffic, so it's hard to say. A lot of departments have policies to break off if the risk of the pursuit gets too high. They'll also break off far more quickly if they have a positive ID for the suspect and can get a warrant issued. They probably didn't have a positive ID but the only known crime seemed to be a stolen vehicle, so my rough guess is that it could have been called off.

            "body": "Sure, but \u201cnever\u201d is a straw man argument. There\u2019s a lot of room between always and never; for example, we can say that police shouldn\u2019t chase suspects unless there\u2019s an imminent threat of serious harm to life or limb, and property theft cases like this don\u2019t qualify. Police would still be able to pursue when then benefit outweighs the cost, but would otherwise need to back off and use  other means to identify and later apprehend the suspect.\n\nIf the suspect carjacked someone or has a hostage they threaten to harm, then by all means, initiate pursuit. But in this case, an officer is dead and a bystander is seriously injured because of a stolen car. Death, serious injury to a bystander, and presumably a lot of property damage to both private and public property is a wildly disproportionate response to property theft, especially when other means to identify and later arrest the suspect exist. This was reckless, and should be a case study in why high speed pursuit is often a bad idea that\u2019s counter to the goal of public safety.",
