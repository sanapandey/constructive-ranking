We build up a tolerance to sweetness, so when you reduce the amount of sweet stuff you eat, you don't need as much sugar.  \n\nI can't in any way say that cutting sweet is the main reason I was able to go from 250 to 200, but I can say that I have trained myself to like less sweet stuff and I really do think that is a significant part of me getting healthier.",

You need a few years of poor (but improving) profitability before you start matching the profitability of a company like Pepsi.\n\nThe problem is that Pepsi, or really any publicly traded packaged goods company, no longer has the stomach for that. Their  boards demand they preserve their profitability while scaling. They could very well launch the brand, but they would have to report eroding profitability for multiple quarters which would send share prices in a tizzy and get the board pissed.\n\nVenture capitalists however, do have the stomach for this. They are willing to have negative profits for a bit as you build the foundations for a brand.\n\nSo Pepsi (and companies like it) basically has outsourced the incubation of new brands to VCs. Then they get to scoop it up. The best part is, the billions that Pepsi pays for Poppi *don't* hit profitability b.c it's a capital expense not an operating expense. So Pepsi gets to enjoy all this additional growth and revenue without hurting profit margins. It's a win-win...kinda.\n\nSource: I work in consumer brand startups",
