They'll just make cheap clothes with the Forever 21 label and sell it to other stores. \n\nThey also bought and shuttered Sports Illustrated just so they'd have the naming rights for Sports Illustrated  merchandise. \n\nThey also own a large part of JCPenney whom they force to buy all the Authentic Brands licensed merchandise and clothing.\n\nThat's all they do they buy naming rights to shuttered brands (air walk shoes) then license it to people or force their other children companies to buy it from themselves.",

Not that it\u2019s surprising but still\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m assuming with trump tariffs and the state of the economy, more companies like authentic will sprout up. Forever 21 is dead, let it fade away like it\u2019s supposed to with all the other brands that drive themselves into such debt because of plans for unlimited growth, that bankruptcy is the only way out.\n\nEdit: just want to add. They do not perform any function other than collect money, because they own the IP. They are not operators. To put it simply, they care about the marketing (because that\u2019s what ensures $$). So when forever 21 is being sold at whatever cheap wholesaler, behind the scenes an operator jumped in to run them and will now have to pay a fee to authentic in addition to all regular operating costs. This is only one example of why this is an unsustainable business model. F21 is not the first major bankruptcy in their portfolio this year. And it probably won\u2019t be the last.",

Get a knock at the door, guy dressed like he works for the power company started talking about green energy rebates and that he wants to get my information to make sure my rebates were properly applied.\n\nLuckily I've heard of this scam before, for some reason it's legal for third-party companies to resell power, usually they'll have a lower price for a few months and then jack up the rates and hope people don't notice. This guy was straight-up switching people without telling them and claiming it's a rebate.  \n\nIt just felt suffocating, life in America is just trying to figure out how not to get screwed at every turn.",

Clothing is one of the least concerning aspects of this - the controversy over KIA and Hyundai thefts is a better example of consumers continuing to buy horrible products despite serious issues - for no apparent reason.  \n\nA crappy shirt?  Sure, that's annoying.  A $20,000 car?  You'd think people would do a little research, but no.  Consumer Reports used be a valued source of information partly because it was better information back in the day, but also because *people cared* about how long a washing machine would last, how long a car would run, how much it would cost to maintain, etc.  \n\n20-30% of vehicles in this country are now leased.  A lot of drivers simply don't care if they're driving a Harbor Freight vehicle that would cost $15k to keep running for 10 years, or crap out after 100,000 miles.  Their lease / *subscription* will be over in 3 years and they'll just get a new car.  They wouldn't want to be seen driving a 5 year old model, anyway...\n\nNowadays...you still see a little concern for quality.  I'm in some Toyota forums and the folks there will poke fun at Jeep owners because Jeeps routinely experience significant mechanical problems, while Toyotas are notoriously reliable.  But that illustrates an interesting societal shift: a minority of vehicle owners seem to be concerned with the concept of reliability, and those owners have gravitated towards ~a single brand.  A huge part of the market share is out there buying ~disposable cars.\n\nIt doesn't really make sense to blame a company for making decisions that will make them money.  Yes, what they're doing is arguably unethical, but the fact remains that consumers are choosing to spend money on these products.",

It's just that before COVID retail companies generally staffed sufficiently to allow for straightening, \"during\" COVID they reduced staffing but also had reduced demand in-store so things remained somewhat the same, and \"after\" COVID they kept the reduced staffing while bringing the sales volume back up to pre-COVID levels - resulting in stores being understaffed and causing things like \"straightening\" and \"assisting customers\" and \"avoiding employee burnout\" to fall by the wayside.",

However, I stopped shopping there about 2 years ago, so I cant speak on the quality currently. Although I have been in their stores since then and it appears to me that the quality is still continuing to decline.\n\nThey're also heavily reliant on fast fashion trends (see denim jean boots currently on their website), which many consumers aren't as interested in purchasing anymore. Shein, temu, fashion nova, and so many other online companies offer the same quality and styles for a fraction of the price as well for consumers who do still want fast fashion trends. F21 still charges the same amount (or even more) for their clothes as when they had somewhat okay quality, far less fast fashion competition, and more consumer demand for their clothing styles.\n\nI saw a jacket on their website selling for $60. cheap, mass produced fast fashion is not worth $60 to begin with. the same item can be found on shein for like $20. Most people will opt for shein if they want that item. \n\nI am Canadian, so I cant speak for American stores, but in canada the stores are consistently unpleasant to be in. Always understaffed, always insanely unorganized and every display is constantly messy, huge lack of consistency in what each location has available, store is also just generally \"trashy\" (for lack of a better word) with shotty lighting, no renovations made after whatever store occupied the space before f21, signs never accurate. It honestly looks like something out of the backrooms, but messier. The store quality really strongly reflects the product quality.\n\nI totally get why this store is going under. They dont have anything that makes them competitive or enticing to consumers compared to any other fast fashion retailer. They cheapened out their products to the point they're either fully unwearable or the product is such an ugly monstrosity that no one will even buy it, while still charging like they have any quality left. They have no care for consumer satisfaction, of course people dont want to buy from them.",
