Is it because whether you like him or not, he hasn't actually done anything fascist. I'm not even American, and there is plenty he has done that I don't like, but he was elected by both the popular vote and the electoral college. Like it or not, he has a strong democratic mandate. As well, if he really was a fascist all the public criticism would be suppressed. My grandmother grew up in a Nazi occupied country. No one said shit publicly against the Nazis. Down vote all you want but get some perspective and quit all the hyperbole",

They would claim, with trembling breath, \"I do not say this lightly\u2026\" and yet, their words carried the weight of stone only when shrouded in dusk.\n\nThe people of the land watched, wary but silent, as the shadow-mongers wove their illusions, attempting to reshape the laws of day and night. But then, one dawn, a single voice arose\u2014a traveler, unknown to all but the wind, who simply stepped into the court and whispered:\n\n\"If you cannot say something in the light, slink off.\"\n\nAnd as the words rang through the halls, the shadows trembled. Some shrank back into the crevices from which they came, dissolving like mist in the morning sun. Others raged, demanding the right to remain unseen while dictating the fate of those who stood in the open.\n\nYet the people, one by one, turned to the dawn. They saw the shadows for what they were\u2014ghosts of power, afraid of truth, desperate to cling to the dark. And so, the kingdom changed.\n\nFrom that day forth, no decree spoken in whispers held sway, no order given in secret could bind, and no name could be tarnished without the sun casting its full gaze upon the accuser. Those who spoke only in the dark found themselves exiled to the very obscurity they had once wielded, their voices muffled, unheard beneath the laughter of those who had reclaimed the light.\n\nAnd so, the great cycle turned again. For shadows can only rule when light is forgotten, and there will always be those who dare to step forward and remind the world:\n\n\"If you can't say something in the light, slink off.\"",
