So as per usual, you can argue it's data manipulation because they're using the common definition of a child, and you can argue it's data manipulation if you choose to break the common definition of a child into sub categories.\n\nStep one is to collect the data, which usually doesn't lie(if collected properly). Step 2 is to interpret the data, in a manner to suit one's bias. Data manipulation will always exist.",

We understand 16 year olds shouldn't drink, smoke, sign contracts, drive cars without restrictions, or get married without parental consent. Why? Because we recognize that 16 year olds are not mature enough to make big decisions, and their understanding of the consequences of their actions is still in development.\n\nAnd there's a very obvious reason why there's is a jump in the 15 to 18 sub category of children, massive changes to the developing body leading to chemical imbalances that manifest as increased aggression, depression, mental illness, self harm, violence, competitiveness, etc.\n\nThe observation that 15 to 18 year olds see a jump in gun violence and suicides only reinforces the concept that they are sill children.",

The 1 to 17 grouping is literally just the standard definition of a child, and it\u2019s often used to give a broad overview of child mortality. The fact that different age groups have different causes of death doesn\u2019t mean looking at the full range is pointless.\n\nThe CDC and other orgs break things down further all the time for specific studies. Using a larger age range doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t also analyzing the smaller slices. It\u2019s just one way to get a clearer big-picture view. If anything, both approaches \u2014 broad and specific \u2014 are useful for understanding what\u2019s actually going on.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be real, claiming they\u2019re \u201chedging\u201d just because they used a standard age range is kind of a reach. There\u2019s no evidence they\u2019re trying to manipulate data. Aggregating numbers like this is pretty normal when it comes to identifying general trends or setting policy.",

The relationship people have to those weapons has changed.  The degree we are siloed in society is greater thanks to social media.  Decades of mental health being ignored.  Politicians and pundits dialing up the aggressive rhetoric and pushing us apart until we are all \"other\" to someone and scare somebody.\n\nI'm not saying something dumb like \"guns don't kill people.\"  What I am saying is there are a lot of social and health aspects that are involved that won't go away only looking at the gun.  On top of those there are political issues with a drive to push up apart and lack of will to do absolutely anything positive for the majority of the population.\n\nMost of the changes that would help are progressive ideas and the right and center HATE that as it takes money from the donor class.\n\nWhat this admin is doing is erasing the data, not to say guns aren't a problem, but so they can blame the violence from gun violence on their favorite scapegoats.  Watch.  They are going to make gun violence a \"woke\" issue.",
