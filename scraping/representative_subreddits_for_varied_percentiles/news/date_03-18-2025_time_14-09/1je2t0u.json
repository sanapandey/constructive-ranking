The artist swept this year\u2019s Grammy Awards, taking home five wins, including song of the year and record of the year.

Then First Person Shooter, you can debate how much malicious intent there was.

I don\u2019t think anyone at the time took it as a diss but Kendrick took it personally. I do get him being like don\u2019t use my name and pretend we\u2019re in the same lane.\n\nThen Like That came out where Kendrick basically says \u201cfuck you guys, I\u2019m gonna bury you, I\u2019m better than you.\u201d That was a direct diss and it was on an album that was just like a big chunk of the industry coming out to say \u201cyo Drake we all hate you, we don\u2019t like how you move, we don\u2019t fuck with you.\u201d So while Drake did egg it on and made things about making accusations and mudslinging with Family Matters, Kendrick absolutely swung first.",
