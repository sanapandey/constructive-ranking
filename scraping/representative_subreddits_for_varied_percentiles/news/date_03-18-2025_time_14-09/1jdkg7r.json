I've seen it suggested that its ubiquity isn't just because it's a simple and striking geometric construction (no matter the medium, you can usually draw some straight lines) but that mammoth tusks had a swastika cross-sectional grain pattern, so neolithic humans would have seen it when harvesting them. Whatever the reason, it's all over Hindu and Buddhist art, and spread into general art in Asia, especially as part of a repeating pattern (in Japan, it's also a common map symbol for Shinto shrines). Anthropologists have suggested that it could be related to the movement of the stars around the North Pole, and the Pima specifically say it's related to the Four Winds. The Navajo call it the Whirling Log, and prior to World War 2 it was a super common symbol to find on Native American art sold to tourists.\n\nNowadays, obviously, a lot of people shy away from using the swastika at all, but there's a substantial chunk of the Native community that advocated for the differentiation of their traditional symbols from the Nazi perversion of it. In East Asia, it's so ubiquitous that unless there's some other Nazi symbol present the default assumption is benign.",

The only reason we've been able to get away with the last 50 years of wars is the lack of a draft. If everyone with skin in the game signed up for it voluntarily (or \"voluntarily\", but that only affects the poor and has much the same effect), that insulates the rest of the country and keeps them from being outraged enough to do anything about their kids dying for nothing, because it's not *their* kids. That was the big lesson the military took from Vietnam. Not \"don't fight unjustifiable wars,\" but \"the draft makes it hard to fight unjustifiable wars.\"",

But he's perhaps most well-known for his leadership during an intense battle in Vietnam, which earned him the Medal of Honor.\n\n\n\nRogers has been remembered not just as being a Medal of Honor recipient, but for championing gender and race equality during his long tenure in the Army. His home state has not forgotten him either. Prior to his death, Rogers was inducted into West Virginia State University's ROTC Hall of Fame. A bridge in Cotton Hill, West Virginia, was named the Charles C. Rogers Bridge in 1999; 14 years later, its name was upgraded to the Army Maj. Gen. Charles C. Rogers Memorial Bridge.\n\nNow both mentions of Gender have been switched to mention Sex instead.",

That\u2019s my best guess. I\u2019m a professional web developer and it sounds like to me that you don\u2019t have a lot of knowledge about this stuff. There are other professionals in this thread also saying that there\u2019s no reason why this couldn\u2019t have been done in an automated fashion as well.\n\nI don\u2019t know what you even mean by this: \u201c imo it seems like the url got changed, then they decided to just remove it entirely,\u201d\n \nI don\u2019t know what \u201cremoved entirely\u201d means. If I have an html page with a specific url, and all that code exists but then I point the hyperlink that people click on when they try to access that html page to a html page that doesn\u2019t exist it will 404 out like it did in this case, but the original html could still exist and not be \u2018removed\u2019.

This is not just a slap in the face for all enlisted personnel, or an attack on the dignity of the Armed Forces, but an attempt to invalidate the strength of character necessary to earn the highest military honor.\n\nAs we reflect on this severe transgression by the Trump Administration, let's admire those seven Army values:\n\nLoyalty.\n\nDuty.\n\nRespect.\n\nSelfless Service.\n\nHonor.\n\nIntegrity.\n\nPersonal Courage.\n\nThis is not the first time that this so-called leader and his enablers have attacked military personnel, and if the past is any indicator, it will not be the last. This, however, is notable for the fact that General Rogers' only offense is apparently being black while in uniform. He didn't speak out against Donald Trump. He died in 1990.\n\nAs a veteran, I have long been tired of having service be bent towards purely political purposes. It used to be that challenging someone else's service and attempting to qualify someone else's achievements in uniform was largely regarded as completely removed from decency. The act of a morally bankrupt imbecile; how else would you characterize someone who took it upon themselves to disparage someone's time in the military for a momentary advantage? It has since been made an acceptable practice. The beginning of a slippery slope. At some point in our lives we've known or heard someone unafraid to cross that line. After years of passive tolerance, we are now here. Seeing a dead serviceman's legacy get smeared by dickless pieces of shit who will never identify themselves, solely for political points.\n\nWe are having our values attacked by self-serving sociopaths who believe our empathy is a weakness. We're being told to sacrifice by people who have never had to make a single sacrifice in their lives. Acts of timeless bravery will continue to be diminished by this administration so as to control and alter the concept of being brave.\n\nIt used to be beyond the pale to insinuate that someone didn't serve \"enough\", that their time did not measure someone else's standard of what a veteran is, let alone what characteristics they're supposed to have in the profession of arms. Now we're seeing a man like Musk call Sen. Kelly, a combat veteran, a \"traitor\", to say nothing of the article above. Since when is this country in the business of allowing the cowardly to define heroism? Soon the words \"valor\", \"bravery\", \"honor\", \"integrity\" will all have extremely limited definitions to suit whatever agenda these people want to accomplish -- all while those who have earned their accolades through grit, ferocity, and perseverance find their achievements struck from the record and their service disavowed because they had the wrong skin color.",

Gen. Charles Calvin Rogers only got the medal because he's black. \n\nHe actually got the medal during the war in Vietnam because the man ran through mortar fire to direct and rally his fellow artillery units in the area, getting blown up in the process and carrying on. Afterwards then fighting off an attack on one of their artillery emplacements and being shot and wounded a second time, then he fought those guys back and refused medical attention so he could defend another attack on a different artillery emplacement. After that, he ran to yet another artillery position to stop a 3rd attack, and to help get their gun back up and running. During that he was wounded a third time, and couldn't help anymore but continued to direct artillery fire of the emplacement until the enemy retreated for good. \n\nApparently, none of that mattered and it was because he was black he got the medal (according to Republicans), and not because of all the shit he did. So, as an insult they added \"DEI\" behind the word medal in the URL where you can read about what happened to him after getting flak for taking it down.\n\nEDIT: Stop downvoting the dude for asking a question, he doesn't speak English primarily, he asked for clarification.
