                    "body": "The goal is isolation through Peter Thiel\u2019s and Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s version of globalization, the claims he wants Greenland (metals for tech)/Canada/Panama Canal are not a bluff. In fact I think he will talk about annexing Mexico next. Eventually to dissuade folks over those fears (basically these rants are a test to see how it can be taken) the plan will be more install puppet governments with the end goal of using them for labor and manufacturing hubs. The steps taken will be similar to what\u2019s happening to federal agencies and federal employees here. This is where Peter Thiel/Palantir comes in. Using AI to replace federal employees and advanced software like Palantir to run the day to day operations of the intelligence agencies and armies in those countries (explanation below about the U.S. and UK along with links). The folks behind Trump are Peter Theil/Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the standard technique of privatization: Defund, make sure things don\u2019t work, People get angry, you hand it over to private capital\u201d\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/26/elon-musk-peter-thiel-apartheid-south-africa\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/02/seeing-stones-pandemic-reveals-palantirs-troubling-reach-in-europe\n\nhttps://uwpexponent.com/opinions/2025/03/13/who-is-peter-thiel/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies\n\nSpecifically Trump is throwing all these policies up and Palantir analytics software is see what works/fails and why along with what to change next time. The goal maybe isolationism but the path to it through seeing what works and what doesn\u2019t under trump then refining it for Vance. JD Vance\u2019s benefactor for more than 10 years has been Peter Theil (founder and still majority owner of Palantir, explained with shares and link further down) the 2nd biggest defense contractor for the CIA/NSA handling their day to day operations along with several UK intelligence agencies and armed forces this doesn\u2019t even cover the data Palantir received from Greece at the height of Covid (links above) or that Palantir provides support to the IDF for \u201cwar-related missions\u201d (links above), for the US military Elon Musk provides them starshield (military version of starlink).\n\nhttps://washingtonspectator.org/peter-thiel-and-the-american-apocalypse/\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2009/07/13/106479613/a-tech-fix-for-illegal-government-snooping\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125200842406984303\n\nPeter was born in West Germany and grew up in a South African town that still believes in Hitler. Cantor Fitzgerald lost so many people on 9/11. I think they realized isolationism is the key. Cantor\u2019s chairman is our secretary of commerce. He quit cantor only a month ago and now his son is in charge.\n\nThiel directly own roughly 180 million publicly traded shares which 7%. His investment firm Rivendell 7 owns 34 million publicly traded shares. Other Thiel vehicles own 37 million shares. Thiel entities also own 32.5 million supervoting Class B shares in Palantir. Those class b shares carry 10 votes while public ones carry only 1 vote per share. Now here is the kicker for why he still controls Palantir (link below), Thiel has sole investment power over 335,000 class F shares as part of a trust that has 49.99% voting interest in the company.\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-stock-chairman-peter-thiel-b63415c7\n\nLeaked documents showed Palantir's clients as of 2013 included at least twelve groups within the U.S. government, including the CIA, the DHS, the NSA, the FBI, the CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, the Special Operations Command, the United States Military Academy, the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization and Allies\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2015/01/11/leaked-palantir-doc-reveals-uses-specific-functions-and-key-clients/\n\nIt would explain why Trump ordered hectares of federal land be stripped for timber. It makes sense why they would want to drill and mine federal lands/national parks for oil and metals. Making Canada and Mexico into manufacturing zones. Just a couple weeks ago Blackrock (an American company) bought 43 ports in 23 countries that includes 2 of the 4 Panama Canal ports for $23 billion dollars. Those 2 ports, Cristobal and Balboa, one on the Atlantic side and one on the Pacific side are the 2 most important ports at the Panama Canal.\n\nhttps://www.michiganfarmnews.com/critical-panama-canal-ports-of-entry-purchased-by-us-investor-giant-blackrock\n\nAnother big factor in isolation is now controlling the internet which starlink has started. Starlink has partnered with TMobile to provide service bad connection areas. TMobile announced that it would let rival\u2019s AT&T and Verizon customers use starlink as well.\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/networking/t-mobiles-free-starlink-satellite-service-opens-up-to-at-t-and-verizon-customers/\n\nHaving Israel/Gaza/West Bank as sort of an embassy to the world with Peter Theil\u2019s hooks in the UK because about a year and a half ago they got the contract to manage UK\u2019s health system along with all the work Palantir is already doing for their intelligence agencies and army (links below), the UK is our link to the world. Greenland is the buffer zone with Panama Canal as the border to the south. Tariffs in the short term hurt the economy but long term would force manufacturing to increase within our borders.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2024/07/16/jd-vance-and-peter-thiel-what-to-know-about-the-relationship-between-trumps-vp-pick-and-the-billionaire/\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/07/palantir-delivers-first-two-ai-enabled-systems-to-us-army.html\n\nAn era of isolationism is the goal, there is even a section on it in Project 2025 which was written by Cantor Fitzgerald and the heritage foundation.\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/blackrock-panama-canal-deal-ck-hutchison-trump/\n\nhttps://poorandpissed.wordpress.com/2025/03/07/the-shadow-players-behind-project-2025-wall-street-cantor-fitzgerald-the-heritage-foundation-and-the-privatization-of-americas-public-resources/\n\nhttps://www.westword.com/news/opinion-palantir-technologies-puts-colorado-at-center-of-future-of-ai-23822908\n\nhttps://corporatewatch.org/palantir-in-the-uk/\n\nhttps://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/127784/html/\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/business/palantir-nhs-uk-health-contract-thiel.html\n\nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/article/trump-quietly-plans-to-liquidate-public-lands-to-finance-his-sovereign-wealth-fund/\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5RpPTRcz1no",

In fact I think he will talk about annexing Mexico next. Eventually to dissuade folks over those fears (basically these rants are a test to see how it can be taken) the plan will be more install puppet governments with the end goal of using them for labor and manufacturing hubs. The steps taken will be similar to what\u2019s happening to federal agencies and federal employees here. This is where Peter Thiel/Palantir comes in. Using AI to replace federal employees and advanced software like Palantir to run the day to day operations of the intelligence agencies and armies in those countries (explanation below about the U.S. and UK along with links). The folks behind Trump are Peter Theil/Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the standard technique of privatization: Defund, make sure things don\u2019t work, People get angry, you hand it over to private capital\u201d\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/26/elon-musk-peter-thiel-apartheid-south-africa\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/02/seeing-stones-pandemic-reveals-palantirs-troubling-reach-in-europe\n\nhttps://uwpexponent.com/opinions/2025/03/13/who-is-peter-thiel/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies\n\nSpecifically Trump is throwing all these policies up and Palantir analytics software is see what works/fails and why along with what to change next time. The goal maybe isolationism but the path to it through seeing what works and what doesn\u2019t under trump then refining it for Vance. JD Vance\u2019s benefactor for more than 10 years has been Peter Theil (founder and still majority owner of Palantir, explained with shares and link further down) the 2nd biggest defense contractor for the CIA/NSA handling their day to day operations along with several UK intelligence agencies and armed forces this doesn\u2019t even cover the data Palantir received from Greece at the height of Covid (links above) or that Palantir provides support to the IDF for \u201cwar-related missions\u201d (links above), for the US military Elon Musk provides them starshield (military version of starlink).\n\nhttps://washingtonspectator.org/peter-thiel-and-the-american-apocalypse/\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2009/07/13/106479613/a-tech-fix-for-illegal-government-snooping\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125200842406984303\n\nPeter was born in West Germany and grew up in a South African town that still believes in Hitler. Cantor Fitzgerald lost so many people on 9/11. I think they realized isolationism is the key. Cantor\u2019s chairman is our secretary of commerce. He quit cantor only a month ago and now his son is in charge.\n\nThiel directly own roughly 180 million publicly traded shares which 7%. His investment firm Rivendell 7 owns 34 million publicly traded shares. Other Thiel vehicles own 37 million shares. Thiel entities also own 32.5 million supervoting Class B shares in Palantir. Those class b shares carry 10 votes while public ones carry only 1 vote per share. Now here is the kicker for why he still controls Palantir (link below), Thiel has sole investment power over 335,000 class F shares as part of a trust that has 49.99% voting interest in the company.\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-stock-chairman-peter-thiel-b63415c7\n\nLeaked documents showed Palantir's clients as of 2013 included at least twelve groups within the U.S. government, including the CIA, the DHS, the NSA, the FBI, the CDC, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, the Special Operations Command, the United States Military Academy, the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization and Allies\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2015/01/11/leaked-palantir-doc-reveals-uses-specific-functions-and-key-clients/\n\nIt would explain why Trump ordered hectares of federal land be stripped for timber. It makes sense why they would want to drill and mine federal lands/national parks for oil and metals. Making Canada and Mexico into manufacturing zones. Just a couple weeks ago Blackrock (an American company) bought 43 ports in 23 countries that includes 2 of the 4 Panama Canal ports for $23 billion dollars. Those 2 ports, Cristobal and Balboa, one on the Atlantic side and one on the Pacific side are the 2 most important ports at the Panama Canal.\n\nhttps://www.michiganfarmnews.com/critical-panama-canal-ports-of-entry-purchased-by-us-investor-giant-blackrock\n\nAnother big factor in isolation is now controlling the internet which starlink has started. Starlink has partnered with TMobile to provide service bad connection areas. TMobile announced that it would let rival\u2019s AT&T and Verizon customers use starlink as well.\n\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/networking/t-mobiles-free-starlink-satellite-service-opens-up-to-at-t-and-verizon-customers/\n\nHaving Israel/Gaza/West Bank as sort of an embassy to the world with Peter Theil\u2019s hooks in the UK because about a year and a half ago they got the contract to manage UK\u2019s health system along with all the work Palantir is already doing for their intelligence agencies and army (links below), the UK is our link to the world. Greenland is the buffer zone with Panama Canal as the border to the south. Tariffs in the short term hurt the economy but long term would force manufacturing to increase within our borders.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2024/07/16/jd-vance-and-peter-thiel-what-to-know-about-the-relationship-between-trumps-vp-pick-and-the-billionaire/\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/07/palantir-delivers-first-two-ai-enabled-systems-to-us-army.html\n\nAn era of isolationism is the goal, there is even a section on it in Project 2025 which was written by Cantor Fitzgerald and the heritage foundation.\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/blackrock-panama-canal-deal-ck-hutchison-trump/\n\nhttps://poorandpissed.wordpress.com/2025/03/07/the-shadow-players-behind-project-2025-wall-street-cantor-fitzgerald-the-heritage-foundation-and-the-privatization-of-americas-public-resources/\n\nhttps://www.westword.com/news/opinion-palantir-technologies-puts-colorado-at-center-of-future-of-ai-23822908\n\nhttps://corporatewatch.org/palantir-in-the-uk/\n\nhttps://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/127784/html/\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/business/palantir-nhs-uk-health-contract-thiel.html\n\nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/article/trump-quietly-plans-to-liquidate-public-lands-to-finance-his-sovereign-wealth-fund/\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5RpPTRcz1no",

China has a vested interest in maintaining order and stability to check these criminal operations (though some of the armed groups may not be much better).
