This process is not just for award show gigs, but for all their comedy routines. \n\nThe part that stuck out in my mind was that it takes Chris Rock 18 months of \"workshopping\" his material in out-of-the-way comedy clubs to whittle down to enough killer jokes for a 90-minute comedy special.\n\nI think Rock also said he doesn't make an effort to sound funny or use funny voices when he's trying out new material. The jokes should be funny on their own, without the funny delivery. Like he'll just read out a joke from paper, and if it bombs and gets no laughs from the audience he throws away that paper and reads the next joke.\n\nI overheard a local comedian in my town say something similar to his friends.\n\nHe said he got hired to give a monologue at a party, \"just a few jokes,\" the client told him. He did it and his monologue went well, but he lamented at how he wasn't as good as he could have been because it was such a rush job. He might have had a week or two of prep?\n\nThe comedian explained to his friends how it takes him ***months*** to test out new material even for a 15-minute monologue.\n\nHe said with party gigs like that, you also have to ask the client lots of questions, do background research, personalize the jokes for the guest of honor and struggle with how much to be topical about current events or stick to joking about the guest. He was a true professional. \n\nCool to hear how a comedian's creative process works.",

He was the face and star of the show, and if Late Night failed he would feel like it was on his shoulders, and his whole staff would lose their jobs.\n\nOnce he was years into doing it you could tell he was way more relaxed.

When he was hosting the Tonight show, those travel remotes were 5-15 minutes and so it was all the best stuff crammed and those are effing hilarious.\n\nAlso - Conan's bits where he'd travel around LA with a celebrity or a team member are some of my absolute favorites. Or even just the stuff where he'd show you around his office and have candid moments with his staff. \n\nThe podcast is amazing and so is the other stuff he's putting out...honestly as a fan, im just happy he's still going and able to keep it fresh",

The account was always kind of playing footsie with the idea that people knew him from The Simpsons and would probably buy his books because of his work on The Simpsons, but he wasn't going to Tweet about The Simpsons. It was a fun follow back in the day before that site went sideways.\n\n**Edit:** Having now read the interview, I'll say for the people who don't want to read it themselves that it mentions his famous reclusivity, that this interview was definitely something of a 'get' that John did at least in part because it was The New Yorker asking, and the whole thing was done via email over an extended period of time and then edited down. So, yes, he definitely gave an interview, but I still wasn't a million miles off in my original outline of the man. Oh, also, apparently in addition to the half-a-phone interview, he also did about a minute and a half of DVD commentary for one episode once. Again, by phone.",

There's also a freedom to it that he didn't have on network TV.\n\nHe rarely brings up his personal feelings about politics or divisive issues. That's refreshing among today's comedians. He also knows how to actually interview guests, too.\n\nHis style of comedy, probably due to his focus on audio mediums vs visual, has shifted away from slapstick and visual gags. So, now it's his comedic timing, wit, and ability to improve with guests that takes center stage.",

He left that for the initial few years of The Simpsons where he wrote episodes like Marge vs. the Monorail. \n\nHe left The Simpsons to replace Letterman as the host of Late Night back on NBC from 93-09. He briefly replaced Leno as host of the Tonight show after that. NBC Execs fumbled the transition badly, and he went on to do his own Conan late night show on TBS once the dust settled. \n\nAfter that he started a podcast that became a juggernaut, and has filmed a travel show for HBO expanding on his shorter travel segments he used to do during his late night TV era.\n\nBasically been 40 years of him killing it either writing behind the scenes, hosting top tier shows, or running his own productions. He knows everybody in the business and pretty much everybody likes the guy, he\u2019s given a ton of younger musicians and comedians their start, and he\u2019s probably made you laugh at some point in your life even if you didn\u2019t realize it was his work.",
