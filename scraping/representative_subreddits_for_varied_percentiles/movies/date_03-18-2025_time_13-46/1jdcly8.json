And video games, work, and relationships, and kids, and traffic, and psychiatrists etc are all sapping your precious limited time remaining in your lifespan. \n\nAll the things you loved are all caricatures of themselves and heavily commercialized, like the Matrix. And in doing so, the system works.\n\n In reality, presumably \"outside the matrix\", You personally were penalized actual lifespan time to consume the movie, and penalized money to watch the movie, which you worked to earn. Certainly, debt is an allegory for slavery. You'd be homeless and starving without your job,for example. \n\nAnd in your search for the One (good moment this week) or Morpheus (which literally translates as sleep because you are tired, or dreams like owning a home or a full refrigerator), you watched this movie which reflected you in a mirror and called out your escapism, showing you that you were in a shitty matrix yourself and gave you a shitty simulation within a simulation to watch, which is why the fight scenes were intentionally and obviously so badly choreographed. You're bugs bunny. No, wait, Bugs is in the screen, so you're Daffy, or Elmer Fudd. Do you get the joke? \n\nBecauss the whole point had been otherwise lost if you don't wake the f*** up, Mr. Anderson. What good is a phone call, if you don't have a voice? And what good are all those distractions when your potential is being wasted? jUsT lIkE iN ReAl LiFe\n\nThe problem, of course is choice. \n\nEither you choose to be at your desk, on time. Or you choose to go find another job. You could make 6 figures on only fans, or you could make 8 figures on YouTube or make a record, who knows. Maybe you're a rapper. Maybe you're the next Joe Rogan. You made the choice to pursue a career (aka: build someone else's dream, paycheck to paycheck, to the tune of an alarm clock). \n\nThe movie sucks because it was too smart for average viewers who themselves are unable to use even the most elementary and primitive forms of self-reflection and critical thinking. They literally just saw moving pictures on the screen and had no further internal dialogue whatsoever.\n\nIf you didn't like the Matrix 4 then why even watch movies? You should still be on cartoons. The matrix 4 is literally about you. It was made for you, personally. It wants you to impress Jodie Foster. But you won't get the joke. Because you can't even understand the matrix is satire. A comedy. And it's about the audience itself, the proletariat masses, who, by all statistical expectations ought to contain tens of thousands of Einsteins, and who, despite having presumably infinite potential, are all doing a single task in some restaurant or office building or warehouse, like an ant. Like a bug. Like Mr Smith was disgusted by and technically correct. Like Mr Anderson in the movie. At his desk. Until he made the choice to quit his job and start a business (kicking ass, chewing bubblegum,etc). He became a game dev, selling slop to people. And instead of making a wage, he made a profit. But he was still in the matrix, at his desk nevertheless, until he stepped off the ledge of the roof. That's when he manifested his power of choice, and \"flew away\" (died). Do you get it? Did you get the rhetorical device? Give me Liberty or give me death. Indomitable human spirit. \n\nThe alternative, of course, was to go back to work. \n\nBasically a biography of each of us. Probably the best movie of all time, I said to my coworkers around the water cooler.",

Usually a person with talent can then go to a smaller studi to compete and eventually win against the big companies if they're truly talented, but with how media is concentrated now there aren't smaller studios to go to, and the big companies own all the avenue to show stuff.  \n\nWhen zaslav leaves, expect another money guy instead of a media guy who is there because he schmoozes with everybody as well, and the cycle to begin again, zaslav is the symptom, not the disease.",

My first comment in this thread was saying that there's no reason that the movie couldn't make that money if the movie is good due to the draw that Superman has from being most recognizable superhero.\n\nI never said it would make 2B. I said I think people have severely overlooked the potential impact of this movie on this summer's slate. I also am hoping to see Superman beat out Fantastic 4, partly because I think F4 is going to be so different from existing Marvel properties it won't hit with general audiences as well as the significant popularity gap between the original superhero (Superman) and the First Family (arguably 2nd - 3rd tier Marvel characters). Add in that James Gunn has yet to some up short and I think that DC has a banger on their hands and we're going to see some really great stories as a result.",

(It also got greenlit during the time in 2022 when DC was in a bit of a pickle.)\n\nIt was later claimed that Todd Phillips disregarded the notes, along with more or less complete creative control, not wanting to have anything to do with DC, and that it wasn't test screened, with Todd Phillips also hellbent on the premiere being in competition in Venice, which quite literally became the first time it was ever shown to the public.
