His fellow professors decide to leave the party, and during that time they ask him why he's leaving. He decides to tell them he's 14,000-years-old, and he has to move on when people realize that he doesn't age. That's not giving anything away about the movie, even if it seems like it is. It's an absolutely fantastic movie, where they try to decide if he's crazy, or if he's telling the truth.",

That is to say, filmed in Africa with a certain amount of focus on the bushmen, and with narration by Paddy O'Byrne, who was a good fit for the half-tongue-in-cheek nature of the movie's presentation.  With _Beautiful People,_ which was essentially a nature documentary movie done in the style of Disney's earlier _True Life Adventures_ features, Uys had already established a reputation for sort of making up mini-plots in service of the footage he filmed.  I remember in particular the ending of the movie, which documented the plight of baby pelicans whose lake dried up prematurely, forcing them to wander off into the desert to die.  Uys tried to salvage the mood by artificially creating a positive spin where the rain mercifully swept in to offer reprieve\u2014yet the \"rain\" was actually a 70s-era optical effect only, and the pelicans on film allegedly being \"spared\" were in fact merely suffering under the baking sun.\n\nMy theory is that _The Gods Must Be Crazy_ was originally planned to be a followup to _Beautiful People_ following the same formula, which of course it does for the first act, except at some point it was decided to make a full blown comedy with a few different plots that eventually converge.  I think this was a stroke of genius.  Though I do sometimes wonder what kind of movie we would have gotten if my hypothetical _\"Beautiful People II\"_ had been developed instead.",

Was it due to changing production value expectations and a general dislike of 70s aesthetics?\n\nI really want to read a book or see a documentary that talks about how diametrically different every aspect of culture and life was in the 70s compared to the 90s but no one has talked about it in a coherent way. We're the same distance from 2000 as the mid 70s was from 2000, and I legit don't believe culture is nearly as different from 2000-2025 as it was 1975-2000.",

I won't call him a bad filmmaker or anything, as I can recognize he's talented and all of his choices are specific and part of his style and storytelling technique. It's just WILD to me how intertwined he is with the Coen brothers and how closely they worked together early on. One of the few times I actually walked away liking a Raimi film was Darkman, because the batshit crazy nature of it all and the campy-ness works really well for that film, somehow. One of the ones I absolutely HATED (until recently) was The Quick and the Dead. I rewatched it not long ago because it was on Netflix, and I realized it was actually a fantastic story and really not so bad (if you can ignore the straight-up Looney Tunes cartoonish nature of how it was filmed). If he had dialed back the Raimi-crazy in that film by just 10% (still 90% nutso) it would have been palatable and been amazing. He just went Full Raimi on that bastard, though. Never go Full Raimi.",

Yeah he said \u201cyour brother hit me call the cops\u201d I, within 3 seconds, thought of \u201clisten my brother has mental problems he really won\u2019t do well in jail so how about this, how about I give you $30,000 and you promise never to speak of this ever again\u201d bam, problem solved. How does he immediately chose to murder him. It would\u2019ve been a relief to learn he\u2019s not actually dead. Just pay him with some of the $4,400,000 you just found.. give him $30,000 to stay quiet and that\u2019s the end of that. I\u2019m barely past that part but I had to come back to Reddit where this movie was recommended to me because I\u2019m so pissed at this fucking stupidity.

I saw the twist a mile off, and it was like a high school understanding of religion. For some reason Reddit loves this film, and I don't wish to offend anyone but it was not what I was expecting.

Astute cinephiles will notice that it is the same R2-D2 from the original trilogy.\n\nAlso if you pay close attention to Hitchcock's Psycho, you will learn that Norman's mother was dead the entire time!

The title is a pun so also takes a tiny bit of brain to \"get\" and it works doubly well because the Beatles, which the poster is parodying is also a pun.\n\nFor the American poster, they dropped the pun title, they fudged the abbey road reference by increasing it to 6 people on the plank, not 4 and by including the love interest because, pretty girls sell I guess? Also they added a literal boat load of party girls to the background for what you can only assume is the same reason.\n\nIdk man, it seems to me that changes made to film titles for American audiences are **always** in service to the lowest possible denominator and is often the death of subtlety and style.",

Many people in the UK and Ireland or at least people over the age of 25-30 in 2009 and with at least a passing interest in music, media and history - would have heard of Radio Caroline or been aware there was a legendary radio station in \"the old days\" which specifically broadcast from a boat, but the same can't be said of North America, where that didn't happen.\n\nSo the context of the title \"The Boat That Rocked\" simply wouldn't be understood outside of Britain and Ireland, because it's *our* history.

I disagree with you. And I'm neither British nor American. So I didn't know shit about the story when I first watched it. And I do think the British title is still better even if you don't know the story, for the reasons I stated earlier. To me Pirate Radio sounds like a bad telefilm that is broadcasted on a Sunday afternoon when you're too full of food to actually care about anything that's happening on the screen and you just wanna nap ahah\n\nBut once again, to each their own, I'm not here to tell you you're wrong for preferring one to the other. I think you're wrong in the way you present your argument as a matter of fact, when I think your argument is subjective too :D",

He and Gene Siskel's original movie review how \"Sneak Previews\" started to air on PBS in 1975 when I was 6.  \n\nHIs written reviews, however - those are SO GOOD. It's clear how much he LOVES the art of cinema, and his ability to express the wonderment, the joy - and even the negatives - is unparalleled.",

And he did a better job separating his personal appreciation of the movie from his analysis of how well it was made than many critics. (I can appreciate the grudging respect he had for CGI-fests. He appeared to understand why they are made, and the craft it took to make them well, even if he didn't appear to personally enjoy seeing them.  That's more than you can say for a lot of Reddit/YouTube critics, who just turn their noses up in a huff and mumble something about the Least Common Denominator.)",

If you only look at the 1st Matrix, then they really don't hinge on that battery conceit too long. They're locked in a war with the machines, that (for the purposes of that film) takes place in this place called The Matrix, for \\*reasons\\* and quickly explain away the reasons. Had they used the CPU analogy instead of the battery analogy, it would have changed almost nothing about that film. As they went on to grow the universe and expand the story, that battery analogy got to be very stupid, and I can see how it would impact how much one could enjoy the films. But, for the original, which was a much tighter, more focused story with great characters, scenes, and dialogue, the whole package worked very well.",

The pod's drop sequence, the manuals, the signage, everything. Even their own written language. It was a completely, totally believable future. \n\nThe only thing I dislike is the moon is described (at least from reviews) as a \"poison moon\", whereas I figured that in -this- future, humans simply cannot breathe air on a habitable world. Made me realize we, as a species, might NEVER be able to! There's nothing that can guarantee you're not going to pick up a bug, and bring it back to the rest of humanity, and wipe out an entire space station. \n\nI love this movie to bits and back.\n\nIf you want a movie that is WILDLY different, but, still does that same level of attention to detail, Vesper.",

It is very dialogue heavy.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re into that kind of thing, this is an absolutely beautiful movie. It takes place in a small town (Columbus, Indiana) and centers around two characters: one, an early twenties girl (Haley Lu Richardson) who is lost in life and highly passionate about architecture, but did not pursue further education due to reasons tying her to her hometown. The second, a businessman (John Cho) who returns to Columbus because his father, a famous architect is in the hospital after a fall.\n\nSome things I like about the movie that set it apart:\n- one of the rare love stories that is just about a friendship\n- the city itself is another character, as it is an \u201carchitectural mecca\u201d - almost every building in the city was built by a famous architect and the director really knows how to show it off\n- speaking of that, every frame in this movie is immaculate. You could freeze any one of them and use it as a wallpaper\n- there are some really beautiful moments of life philosophy. Little lessons are taught in one or two scenes",

There are elements of physical comedy, and dramatic comedy, and situational comedy, mixed with some introspective seriousness: all of which make it a 9/10. But it\u2019s the dry humor and witty retorts during the in between moments, that push it over the top to a 10. To wit, if you\u2019re struggling to understand their accents, you likely have a stick up your arse, which you\u2019re not like going to remove just to watch a movie, so turn on the captions, otherwise, you\u2019ll miss the quiet interactions, what I call the Irishness, between the big element scenes.\u00a0",

The first half of the film is trying to be a WTF mystery. But the plot isn't the point, you are not supposed to get a Usual Suspects style denouement from it. It's a beautiful, abstract journey where the tenderness of the two leads relationship plays out against the weird shit happening to them. It is supposed to tickle the subsconscious parts of your brain and make you feel something you can't quite put into words.",

Introduction while the character is young (possibly a cadet at police academy), but most importantly to show how the world is still largely functional both ecologically and socially. Also show that the wealthy know what is coming and are working to insulate themselves from the coming catastrophe. The important part here is to tie these together so the main character gets to see things, but doesn't piece it all together for the big picture.\n\n2. Second arc: show start of large scale failures of the environment and social order breakdowns. Main character is a detective at their peak, and still has hope, but the arc is concluded by showing an event that destroys this and sets them on their path for the conclusion. Also show the wealthy putting their plans into place.\n\n3. Conclusion plays similar to the movie. Main character detective is jaded but still has that glimmer that they are doing their part to bring justice. Have it all finally crushed in the end. Show the futility of the efforts of the wealthy.\n\nAlso: Soylent Green.",

Jerome Bixby was a great sci-fi writer, and this script seemed pretty obviously to be an unofficial prequel to the Star Trek TOS episode, \"Requiem for Methuslah\" about Kirk and co encountering - of course - an immortal who has been alive for centuries. Man From Earth fits perfectly into that timeliness.\n\nAlso, I did the stage play 15 years (and 50 pounds) ago, and I played John Oldman. It was a one-act play, and after the performance - which ended with John standing in the moonlight with his bow, with Sandy walking up and holding me while \"Who Wants To Live Forever\" by Queen is playing. We took poetic license with that, and I always felt it was a bit more upbeat of an ending, though still very sad. I also met my second of 3 fianc\u00e9's in that play. Always a bridesmaid, never had to get a lawyer for a divorce!\n\nFor what it's worth, I pitched the director an idea to make a trailer for the production, which became standard practice around the area afterwords. And yes, it's actually still in it's quick time look on YouTube. Has 23,000 views, which ain't bad for a local Upstate NY community production. \n\nHere it be, if anyone even read this. If so, the music is from Battlestar Galactica (anyone who watches it always asks).\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2ts5NNEddJY?si=VPOwf1DVQ_ztjyw7",

Rather this is a melancholy drama starting Ralph Fiennes about the lives of several generations of a Hungarian Jewish family.\n\nNerve (2016) - A social media game gets out of control; it may have been before it's time now that everyone is making dangerous TikTok videos.  The crane scene is cringeworthy.\n\nUpgrade (2018) - I'd give this one a 10/10.  A cyberpunk thriller with comedic elements that hasn't received much attention as far as I can tell.\n\nThe Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988) - I'll give it a 10/10.

I've known about it for years but finally watched it on New Year's Day this year--make it my first movie of the year.\n\nIt was great, although I did only rate it 4 stars (although after writing this I think I'm going to have to change that to 4 1/2).\n\nIt was very much structured like a stage play, with it being mostly centered on dialogue on one simple set (that was conveniently made simpler by the diegetic explanation that he was moving that day and had almost everything packed up). Also, many of the actors were definitely acting in a more \"theatrical\" way (more expressive than screen acting these days, less naturalistic). Which is a bit jarring if you aren't used to it but definitely not bad.\n\nBy the end I was very impressed, but left with the feeling that it would have been so much better to see it live on stage. You'd be able to put yourself into the shoes of the guests even more---feeling trapped in the man's apparent mania, really feeling the energy of the room. Imagine the scene by the fire, right there in front of you? THAT would be 10/10.\n\nThere was a stage adaptation written by the screenwriter for the film, but AFAIK it was even less successful than the film. I'd kill to see it.",

After failing to find protection from the American embassy and the French police, a despairing Andr\u00e9 scrambles onto a bridge over the Seine, intending to leap to his death. He is surprised to see a tall, beautiful girl clinging to a rail on the same bridge, apparently preparing to end her life as well. She jumps, and he jumps too, suddenly resolving to save her life. After scrambling ashore, she tells him her name is Angel-A. Together, they take a cruise on the Seine, repay Andr\u00e9's creditors, visit a Parisian nightspot, and more, as Angel-A helps Andr\u00e9. He learns that for this purpose she has fallen out of the sky and into his life. Andr\u00e9 finds himself falling in love with this mysterious beauty.",

The one I'm not seeing anywhere on this list (nor has anyone in my life, even film buffs and comedy fans, have seen) is *Rat Race*. Its a 2001 film starring all of the biggest comedians of the 90's (Rowan Atkinson, John Cleese, Whoopie Goldberg, Cuba Gooding Jr., John Lovitz) and its genuinely one of the funniest movies I've seen in my entire life. My parents had it on DVD when I was growing up- there are a handful of jokes that address adult situations (cheating, Nazis, etc.) and some jokes definitely went over my head as a kid, but its mostly just a character-driven slapstick comedy that I would sincerely argue is good for the whole family (like actually- my parents as adults loved it too!).\n\nAnother movie in the same category (hilarious yet forgotten comedies from the 00's/90's) is *Best in Show*. Same deal- crazy characters, a heap of legendary comedians from the era, and really good writing. The comedy in this one is more dry and absurdist, but I still like it quite a bit. The way I remember it, it felt like an American Monty Python skit that lasted 90 minutes by just adding more and more weird characters.",

I love how I know this story ends, I know what it leads to but it still is delivered beautifully. \n\nMovie has a lot of fans who made reviews after seeing it but I know most people who see it on paramount, prolly saw \u201canother kids movie they\u2019ll never watch\u201d.

Walter Matthau as Albert Einstein.\n\n\nSpartan (2004) - Military/Political thriller. Mamet. Val Kilmer searches for the presidents kidnapped daughter.\n\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing (1993) - (Pluto TV) Shakespeare. Kenneth Branaugh. You start for the Shakespeare, but stay for Michael Keaton riding a \"horse\"\n\n\nPrimary Colors (1998) - Political dramedy. Cool movie and \"hey, is that Allison Janney?\"\n\n\nTaps (1981) - Drama. Military school in danger of being torn down is taken over by the students. There is a scene at the end where young YOUNG Tom Cruise is at his most Tom Cruisiest.\n\n\nWitness for the Prosecution (1957) - (Prime) Not really forgotten or unknown, but damn few people have seen it these days and that's a shame for how well it holds up\u00a0\n\n\nComplete Unknown (2016) - (Prime) No, not that one. Don't know why more people don't like this. Don't read a synopsis or watch the trailer.\n\n\nThe Last Detail (1974) - (Tubi) Dramedy. Two Navy lifers (including Jack Nicholson) transport a prisoner (Pre-coo-coo Randy Quaid) back to the states.\n\n\nHigh Anxiety (1977) - Comedy/parody. Mel Brooks. Is it as good as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein or Spaceballs... no. But, the God damn cast is brilliant and any Mel Brooks is better than no Mel Brooks.\n\n\nKontroll (2003) - (Tubi) Drama. Nimrod Antal. Go in blind.\n\n\nThe Signal (2008) - (Tubi) Drama/Horror/Comedy. Sort of an anthology, but instead of different stories of the same genre, it's all one story told in three different styles. Beginning, middle, and end directed by different directors. Neat movie.",

Are the screws really locked up themselves along with the young offenders? Are they any different? What motives/solutions do the 2 groups share? How is power exercised? \n\nThese questions & more can all be safely ignored as you ride along on a story that is strange simultaneously of the mundane & a very crowded plot full of menace, fear & violence\n\nhttps://m.imdb.com/title/tt0079871/\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jgRyH4qYX1s\n\n#_______________________________________\n\nAlso by Alan Clarke, another tale full of violence that began life at the BBC\n\n#*The Firm* (1989) starring Gary Oldman & Phil Davies\n\nOf course back then outrage at TV depiction of violence was a different thing, & this is not a gory film, but the violence does seem somehow 'real', so when Omo gets striped in Birmingham you really feel his shocked realisation at what he's gotten himself into. \n\nAnd for all the fully justified lauding of Oldman's performance *absolutely everyone* in it is really good. Nicely shot & edited too. Clarke really knew how to get the best out of ppl. \n\n>The film, which courted controversy on release, has come to be regarded among the finest films on the subject of football hooliganism. It is notable for having almost no musical score or diegetic music, save for Dean Martin's rendition of \"That's Amore\" over the opening titles. **Oldman's performance has been hailed as one of the greatest of his career**\n\n>t...] \n\n>The Firm proved controversial,[3][4] and has been both celebrated and condemned for its violent content.[5] Tom Dawson in The List reported that it \"is widely considered to be the toughest and most insightful screen depiction of football hooligans\".[6] Vice critic Harry Sword wrote that \"The Firm remains the definitive celluloid document on football hooliganism: a panoramic masterpiece that captured a world of vicious violence and material aspiration\".[7] Philip French in The Observer described the film as \"by some way the best movie on the subject of football hooliganism and a key text on the subject of Thatcher's Britain.\"[8]\n\n>Film4 hailed The Firm as a \"brilliant and compelling drama\" that features Oldman \"at his visceral, intense best\".[9] Josh Winning of Total Film observed its \"unflinching depictions of violence\" along with Clarke's \"layered, fearless approach\", and named Oldman's \"stunning\" performance as the best of his career.[5] Matthew Thrift of the British Film Institute in 2018 wrote that Bissell \"remains probably Gary Oldman's greatest screen performance\".[10]\n\n>The Firm has been described as a cult classic.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Firm_(1989_film)\n\nhttps://m.imdb.com/title/tt0095158/\n\nBadly out of synch trailer that isn't very good anyway but all the others seemed to be UK only. \n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_BmY4wIea5U",

It recounts the true story of the kidnapping of the US Ambassador to Brazil in 1969, with Alan Arkin as the ambassador.\n\nIf there\u2019s any flaw in the film, it\u2019s that it presents both sides as tragically caught up in events. The Ambassador is a real person, he doesn\u2019t want to die, but he will not betray his country even when there\u2019s a gun held to his head. As for the kidnappers, they were (mostly) naive middle class kids who believed their own shallow Marxist rhetoric, and never understood the horror and consequences of revolutionary violence until they themselves unleashed it. Really an incredible film, and the true story is portrayed accurately. \n\nFootnote: One of the lead kidnappers is played by Fernanda Torres, nominated for an Oscar this year for I\u2019m Still Here.",

It makes great use of its single location set to create a fun, tense and anxious scenario for all the characters as they all gradually get more injured by the bullets flying and the dangerous conditions of the abandoned Boston factory they chose for their meeting place. It has some really great performances with cast members like Brie Larson, Cillian Murphy, Sharlto Copley and Armie Hammer (who is still a great actor despite being a horrible person and shines in a rare turn as a sarcastic wisecracking intermediary for the arms dealers)",

Based on a Sami legend, a young man in medieval Scandinavia is forced by a gang of bandits to guide them to a village they intend to plunder.\n\n*The Navigator: A Medieval Odyssey* (1988). Villagers fleeing the plague in medieval Europe wind up in 20th century New Zealand.\n\n\n*Late For Dinner* (1991) Two young men fleeing a crime in the late 1950s wind up in suspended animation for over 30 years, and are then awakened.

That\u2019s the main character (played by Priestly).\n\nYou can sometimes find \u201cdvd releases\u201d online, but they\u2019re not legit. I\u2019m 90% sure this never received a DVD release (way too early for it) and only put out on VHS. I purchased a DVD copy and it\u2019s a fine transfer.\n\nThis movie had a tiny budget and a tinier release. Which is sad because it\u2019s incredibly funny, and made me turn a corner on Priestly (who I previously never cared for).",

Inside and outside cabin. Hopefully some people will go and see it now because of this post. \n\nIf I had to pick one myself Me and You and Everyone we Know. it's a great artistic indie film about different people and their interconnected relationships.

I saw it back in college and it really stuck with me all these years for a few different reasons:\n\nThe entire movie is dialogue and almost all of it takes place in the same room. It feels like a play. I really like movies like this because they are so rare and because they don't use special effects or editing to captivate you: it is all dialogue.\n\nThe entire premise is so captivating and the main character's story is so interesting yet, like the characters in the movie, you don't know if it's true.",

The attention to detail is phenomenal, and amongst the supremely irritating crowd of people who bitch and moan about historical accuracy, it's regarded as one of the most accurate historical films, down to all the little riggings, and how the ropes twist and other shit i dont know enough about.\n\nIt got EXTREMELY unlucky in that it was released the same year as LOTR:ROTK. It was nominated for ten oscars, and lost almost all of them to ROTK. Not that the oscars matter, but it did help to sort of bury the film.\n\nYou can absolutely make the \"crazy\" argument that Master and Commander is a better film than ROTK with all things considered. ROTK is top tier for sure, but pretty flawed, and you could make the argument that M&C is closer to a \"perfect\", concise, more well rounded film experience.",

It's probably one of the best depictions of adolescence I've ever seen in a movie. Characters drink and do drugs, but they aren't like, Netflix Original Movie/Euphoria teens where everyone is sexy and always banging each other. It's a pretty realistic depiction of what it's like to be a teenager and do drugs. Sometimes you get the wrong shit and have a bad trip. Sometimes you get robbed and lose your shit and your money. Sometimes you just want to chill out. \n\nThe characters aren't all universally good or bad either. Like, you watch some garbage like Euphoria and it's all \"we are all bad kids and all pieces of shit and all only care about ourselves.\" It's like teenagers can't have their own identity and think for themselves? \n\nBut in Over The Edge you have characters who face conflicts of interest and loyalty to friends and family and struggle with doing what is right and what is legal, etc. etc. Some characters who start as assholes end up doing the right thing. Some characters are just on the sidelines going along with what's happening. There's depth and individuality. \n\nAlso, Criss Cross.",

Thirteen-year-old Soran, known by the alias Kak Satellite, is known for his installation of dishes and antenna for the villages who are looking for news about Saddam Hussein, he is also known for his limited knowledge of the English language, which he learns because he interacts with the Americans when they invade. He is the dynamic, but manipulative leader of the children, organizing the dangerous but necessary sweeping and clearing of the minefields. Many of these children are injured one way or the other, yet still maintain a boisterous prattle whenever possible, devoted to their work in spite of the vagaries of their life.",

It stars Mads Mikkelsen early in his career and it is one of the funniest and most quotable movies I've ever watched. I put it right up there with the Big Labowsky and What We Do in the Shadows as my favorite comedies of all time. Every Danish person can quote this movie, but it never got a reputation outside of Danmark. Maybe because there are a lot of danish pop culture references that might go over the head of foreign viewers, but there are enough jokes in it that it won't matter. And the movie is both dark, violent and heart warming and the director has a very original style and writing.",

            "body": "Assuming a demanding clause such as \"hardly anyone has heard of it\" needs a strict set of selection criteria, I decided to list some of my favourite movies that received less than fifty-thousand votes at the IMDB.\n\nCentral do Brasil [Central Station] \n(1998) \n(Dir. Walter Salles)\n- Fernanda Montenegro gives here probably the strongest acting performance in movie history. She is sublime in this, her acting is so subtle yet powerful. Truly enchanting.\n\nThe Servant\n(1963)\n(Dir. Joseph Losey)\n- Fantastic portrayal of class relations and tensions stemming from it. Superb acting by Dirk Bogarde. If you liked \"Parasite (2019)\" you might want to watch this one.\n\nCarandiru\n(2003)\n(Dir. Hector Babenco)\n- One of finest examples of the Brazilian cinema-boom which gave us a series of masterpieces after mid-1990s. Set in the largest prison in Latin America and based on the testimonies of the prisoners, the movie portrays the prison life in a painfully realistic manner.\n\nMasumiyet [Innocence]\n(1997)\n(Dir. Zeki Demirkubuz)\n- A treatise on the extremely destructive nature of love and obsession. Solid performances from the cast members. The script is very tight (probably due to the director's fascination with literature), it reminds me of Sartre's short story \"The Wall\".\n\nLand and Freedom\n(1995)\n(Dir. Ken Loach)\n- Set in the tumultuous days of the Spanish Civil War, the movie depicts how and why the joint war effort against Franco's forces disintegrated over time through the eyes of a British volunteer. Ken Loach brilliantly summarizes the fault lines in revolutionary Socialist politics, the assembly scene in which the revolutionaries debate how far they should go with the collectivization in a village they recently liberated from the fascists is especially strong and very precise.\n\nStanno tutti bene [Everybody's Fine]\n(1990)\n(Dir. Giuseppe Tornatore)\n- An aging father of five assumes that his children who did not visit their parents for a long time must be \"too busy with their successful careers and fulfilling personal lives\" decides to surprise them all with a visit. It turns out that he was a bit optimistic with his assumptions. Marcello Mastroianni's acting is truly splendid even by his very high standards.\n\nLe huiti\u00e8me jour [The Eighth Day]\n(1996)\n(Dir. Jaco Van Dormael)\n- My favourite road-trip movie. This one is probably the finest depiction of disability in movie history. The chemistry between the leading duo of Pascal Duquenne and Daniel Auteuil is simply magical. (Note: Auteuil's run between 1986 and 2005 (starting with \"Jean de Florette\" and ending with \"Cach\u00e9\") has to be one of the pinnacles of acting as an art form. In addition to the above-mentioned movies, I suggest everyone to check out \"Manon des sources\", \"Un coeur en hiver\", \"La fille sur lee pont\", and \"La reine Margot\".) \n\nBadkonake sefid [The White Balloon]\n(1995)\n(Dir. Jafar Panahi)\n- Based on a simple script written by Kiarostami, few movies manage to capture the utter beauty of children's innocence as well as this one. \n\nNaked\n(1993)\n(Dir. Mike Leigh)\n- This one is a tough watch but David Thewlis' performance as Johnny, a talkative, self-destructive, unredeemable pseudo-intellectual is mesmerizing. Strong recommendation for those who like character-driven dramas or who have a general interest in the bleak, post-Thatcherite Britain. \n\n303\n(2018)\n(Dir. Hans Weingartner)\n- Two people with completely different world-views decide to share a ride. The journey which starts with philosophical discussions slowly leads to romance. The ending sequence is beautifully directed. If you liked Linklater's \"Before Sunrise (1995)\", you might want to watch this one.\n\nNun va Goldoon [A Moment of Innocence]\n(1996)\n(Dir. Mohsen Makhmalbaf)\n- The strict codes and regulations implemented by the regime after the Islamic Revolution of 1979 forced Iranian filmmakers to find new ways to tell their stories. This movie has to be one of most unique examples of this trend. It combines stylistic elements of documentaries, historical reconstructions and biopics in the framework of a narrative feature film. Truly exceptional. (For other examples of Iranian filmmakers pushing the boundaries of conventional movie making, see \"Close-Up (1990)\", \"And Life Goes On\" (1992), and \"Through the Olive Trees\" (1994) by Kiarostami, \"This Is Not a Film (2011)\", \"Taxi (2015)\", and \"3 Faces (2018)\" by Panahi) \n\nDrishyam\n(2013)\n(Dir. Jeethu Joseph)\n- I am aware that this pick is going to be controversial. Surely, this is one of the most successful movies of all time. Already remade into six languages (at least), millions of moviegoers watched Drishyam in some form but unfortunately not many people in the English-speaking world heard of it. It turns out that an American remake is on its way, so I suggest everyone to watch the original before that happens.\n\nPlemya [The Tribe]\n(2014)\n(Dir. Myroslav Slaboshpytskyi) \n- This is one of the most upsetting, and brutal movies I have ever seen. Set in a boarding school for the deaf, it tells the story of how a group of vulnerable kids are forced to live immoral lives. The direction is simply amazing. \n\nLa faute \u00e0 Fidel! [Blame It on Fidel]\n(2006)\n(Dir. Julie Gavras)\n- A little girl's cushy, bourgeois life shatters when her parents decide to become political activists following the developments of 1968 World Revolution. Nina Kervel-Bey puts on one of the greatest performances from a child actress.\n\nAbad va yek rooz [Life and a Day]\n(2016)\n(Dir. Saeed Roustayi)\n- The story of a modern, dysfunctional Iranian family on the verge of a total collapse. Fabulous performances from the cast, especially from Parinaz Izadyar and the always great Payman Maadi.\n\nMedalia de onoare [Medal of Honour]\n(2009)\n(Dir. C\u00e3lin Peter Netzer)\n- An old Romanian man who accidentally receives a Medal of Honour for his service back in WW2, decides to keep it to get some respect from his family and regain his dignity.\n\nEl ciudadano ilustre [The Distinguished Citizen]\n(2016)\n(Dir. Gast\u00f3n Duprat & Mariano Cohn)\n- A winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, who has been living in Europe for decades, returns to his hometown in rural Argentina. Probably the best comedy of the last decade.\n\nSieranevada\n(2016)\n(Dir. Cristi Puiu)\n- A large Romanian family coming together for a family meal. Superb camera-work by Puiu since most of the movie takes place in a typical, very confined Romanian apartment. Great dialogues.",

You never entirely get your  questions answered as to why, you just get a demented case study in how things that can't go on forever, don't.\n\nGiven that the kids going through puberty is one of the impetuses to change as the film progresses...*and it's Greek*... I'd like to reassure folks that what little onscreen nudity occurs is dealt with right at the start, and the parents are not sexually abusive towards their offspring.  I should also, however, set out a trigger warning for those among you who may be upset by the idea of a middle-aged man savagely attacking a neighborhood cat with a pair of garden shears before it could hurt his family.",

I don't know, and the people who showed up to this movie thinking they were getting a horror like super-natural film similar to The Exorcist didn't know either, confusing audiences, and resulting in low audience turnout - it also came the same weekend as Star Wars, so there's that. \n\nAnyway, this is a notorious box office BOMB - Friedkin spent the rest of his career in the shadow of this movie's failure, and its absolutely AMAZING. The suspense is OFF THE SCALES. The pacing is PERFECT. The cast and crew killed themselves in the jungle to make this, and nobody saw it. \n\nThe Wages of Fear (1953) is adapted from the same novel, and is also extremely good. Highly recommend both.",

Not an Oscar film, and lots of sites panned it, but every time I see it on the screen I simply have to sit down and watch it.
