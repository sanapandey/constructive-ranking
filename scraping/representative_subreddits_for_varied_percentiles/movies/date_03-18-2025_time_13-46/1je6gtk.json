    "selftext": "In Costello's opening narration, he says \"twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get a fucking job, we had the presidency, may he rest in peace\". Going by the timeline, it implies he was referring to JFK, who has Irish roots (& is someone Frank seems to admire). And this line plays over the first time we see the guy on screen.\n\nIn that ballistics lecture Colin attends (Matt Damon's first scene), the subject matter being discussed/diagrams being used are that of JFK's head wounds when he was assassinated.\n\nDunno if it can be seen as foreshadowing that Colin will end up killing Costello, but if it is, nice touch.",
