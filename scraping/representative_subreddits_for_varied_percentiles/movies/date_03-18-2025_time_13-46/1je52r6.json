In an age of big budget franchise slop, it was really refreshing to see a mid-budget original movie made by a competent director with a great cast. It's a shame it bombed at the box office because this is the exact type of movie that used to come out like once a month and now seems completely dead",

I was curious why it only had a 93 minute runtime since these kinds of movies run over 2 hours but turned out that it was just an efficiently told spy story with no wasted scenes, dialogue or character interaction. Shows you can have a movie that's complex but not overly complicated.",

Another feather in Rockwell's incredible career. \n\nThis film was co-written by Jim Rash (the Dean from Community) and he co-wrote this right after co-writing the Oscar winning The Descendants. It has a similar vibe, but more uplifting I felt like. This film had so much heart, and hope and it a really great pick-me-up vibe which I needed when watching this.\n\nAlso, Steve Carell really pulled off that sleazy car salesman vibe to a tee. \n\nIt won't be too long until I re-watch this for sure.",

However I was born in the mid 90s, and this movie was just something I never checked out. Being now almost 30, and watching this for the first time, I can't help but relive and feel the same things I did when my parents went through a divorce. I was a lot older than Billy, but it still invoked a lot of the same major emotions. However I also felt for Hoffman's character, and the relationship dynamics.\n\n Overall if you are like me and are part of the tail end of the millennial generation/beginning of Gen Z check this movie out, it still holds up and really moves you through the story and wonderful score. 5/5",

            "body": "The Ugly Stepsister.\n\nHarkening back to the Brothers Grimm tale, The Ugly Stepsister takes the Cinderella tale we're all familiar with (Disney) and flips it on the head. Set in the fairytale land of Swedlandia, (also confirming what Norwegians have always known, being the worst people on this planet are those neigjboring svenskj\u00e4vlar across the border), the titular Ugly Stepsister Elvira is head over heels infatuated with the wonderful Prince Julian, and upon discovering he will hold a ball in 4 full moons to crown his wife, mother Rebekka eyes this as an opportunity to save them from financial woes. (Little sister Alma is out of the question because she \"hasn't started bleeding yet\".) This will not be easy, however, as both mother and daughter will both go to extreme measures for Elvira to the farest of them all.\n\nThis marks the feature length debut for not only writer-director Emilie Blichfeldt, but also Lea Myren going through quite a lot of miserable things in the demanding titular lead role. And though the script fizzles a bit towards the end, it's a very solid debut with a lot of stylish and creative imagery. Not to mention imagination.\n\nThere were reports of people in audience at the Sundance premiere throwing up during it, although it's said to have been food poisoning. It's still a precaution, because while the body horror of this body horror movie isn't quite as bombastic as people have made it out to be, when there are scenes of it, they deliver on the gross stuff. It's not gross for the sake of being gross, there's a point here.\n\nI should also give an additional precausion to skip the Shudder trailer that released yesterday, because it's not only quite a misrepresentation of what this movie actually is, but also really spoilery. They show a lot of stuff with our Cinderella, in the form of stepsister Agnes. The rivalry and banter between her and Elvira, not to mention how she becomes her stepmother and sisters' slave, goes into some very amusing directions by the way. If you want a more true and safer look at it, check out the two [Norwegian](https://youtu.be/_MZqNliEHns?si=n8X-lnCWG1i7x94o) [trailers](https://youtu.be/lPRW203y3xY?si=66YkvPr78tuPwKxd).\n\nWith all that said and done, this was my most anticipated movie of the year, and for the most part, I was pleased, save for the weaker last stretch of the movie. It's very much recommended, with the caveat that you dial your expectations in a bit, and have a stomach for stuff like this. It's a good 5/6.",

Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow and Isabella Rossellini make it riveting. Fiennes gives a speech about certainty in the middle that I want to frame and hang on my wall. Highly recommended.     \n     \n**Death Wish (1974)** - Kind of like Rambo in that the first one is actually high quality and relevant whereas the sequels go to cartoon land. I loved the lawless late-70s New York in this movie. Plus a baby Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Guest, and Olympia Dukakis show up. A surprising conclusion, too. Glad I finally saw this.     \n    \n**Possession (1980)** -  There are five films that I feel are from another dimension, made me feel like I was dreaming, and even made me question if I myself existed: Upstream Color, Buckaroo Banzai, Cats, Jacob's Ladder, and Possession. But the greatest of them is Possession. Sam Neill and Isabelle Adjani are completely unhinged in this transporting transmission from another reality. Emotional, violent, alien, abstract, and passionate. Adjani gives the definition of 110%. I saw the recently-restored version of it at a late-night screening at my local theater with a crowd of people and it was amazing.",
