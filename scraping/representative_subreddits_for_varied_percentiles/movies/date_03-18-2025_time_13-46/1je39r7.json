Ah sick, they have one. You\u2019ve evaded the purgatory of staring at a wall of new release K-Pax, and even though you\u2019re only 10 years old, you think that there\u2019s something off with the guy on the cover. \n\nYou finally get home n pop it in the VCR, primed for some violence and vulgarity. You are greeted by the easy going sounds Lynyrd skynyrds tuesdays gone. But instead of the montage of crass dick jokes Abe Lincoln n an alligator are waving goodbye to you. That\u2019s right, someone wasn\u2019t so kind, n you gotta rewind the tape. Basically watch the whole movie, scrambled, in reverse, in 5 minutes. To say the night is ruined is an understatement. \n\nAs happy chugs along toward is gold jacket and half the jokes go over your head you think who could have done this? It was probably that little brat in your class, Brandon. He\u2019s a trouble maker and was just talking about this new awesome movie happy Gilmore this week at school. Even though you\u2019ve been riding the happy train for months. Distracted, you finish the movie: chubbs dies, grandma gets her house, n the blonde chick walks around half naked. Not a bad night. \n\nThe next morning, adorning your finest bruins jersey, you\u2019re determined to confront Brandon. He\u2019s getting off another bus from THAT side of town n is already bullying some other classmates.  You accuse him of ruining your Friday night and the altercation quickly turns physical. The two of you wrestle around on the ground, no one able to get the upper hand. In a moment of sheer brilliance you decide to headbutt Brandon. This ends any efforts from him to continue the fight. You get up, tell him the price is wrong bitch, before heading into class to bang out some multiplication tables.",

It's uncomfortable. It's rough. It's raw. It doesn't have a cohesive plot. And there is no one worth rooting for in it. \n\nHowever, with all that being said, the ending was not bad. It was the appropriate path for the storyteller to take. Sandler's character was a degenerate in every way. He abused the trust of everyone who loved him. His addiction to gambling was always going to be his downfall. It's amazing that he wins the biggest bet of his life, only to never actually cash in on it because he underestimated someone's anger towards him.",

Star Wars gets a pass from me as just being sequels because the precedent is already long gaps of time between trilogies (1970\u2019s to the 1990\u2019s to the 2010\u2019s).",

It's the same thing with a lot of actresses and celebrities from the 90s/early 2000s, they can look as good or better than when they were younger since style is so much more flattering. The low rider jeans is such a terrible look on even the hottest of women.",

It\u2019s the same with the movie industry. The middle class movie with its budget like Grown Ups 2, the safe bet investment movie that keeps the industry alive, has been destroyed by $200 million mega movies and all that\u2019s left is companies losing the audiences and hundreds of $millions of dollars on flop after flop.",

            "body": "It looks interesting lol. \n\nCan\u2019t tell what the plot is, but here is what the plot SHOULD BE:\n\nHappy Gilmore is a retired golf legend, after the events of the first movie he kept playing, then settled down to have a family. He still golfs at a local driving range where he can show off and get attention, and teaches beginners how to swing the club (for fun) like chubbs did. A teenager comes to happy for lessons and wants to learn how to be great, happy says sure whatever and teaches the kid with bare minimum enthusiasm (like all of his other clients). The kid has potential, but is not great.\n\nHappy keeps teaching the kid, who does improve. The kid wants to play in the big tournament to win over a girl/beat his bully. Happy thinks that is a stupid reason, but agrees to actually train the kid. The kid improves significantly and beats his bully (with happy watching and coaching on the sideline). \n\nThe kid gets invited/convinced to join an amateur-pro golf tournament in a nearby town and his bully/rival also gets invited based on his connections (his father\u2019s friend). The bully\u2019s coach is shooter McGavin. Shooter is a retired pro who coaches up-and-coming golfers. Happy and the kid train hard and are feeling good. The kid tells happy that shooter is his bully\u2019s coach. They train even harder. The kid is able to make precision putts, but is having trouble driving the ball, and happy is having trouble explaining his windup technique. Shooter comes to the driving range to see happy and taunt him. It is a tense meeting and it ends with happy betting he can drive it farther than shooter. Shooter agrees and happy loses. Happy suggests a rematch bet, and they make a bet that whoever\u2019s kid wins the tournament, the other has to make a public statement saying the other is the best golfer. \n\nBefore the tournament, happy gives the kid a finger from chubbs\u2019 fake hand (it is unclear how he got it and it is commented on in the movie). Fast forward to the tournament, the kids are matched together, meaning the kids and happy and shooter must travel together. Happy has taken up live-streaming during the tournament and hypes up the crowd to throw off shooter and the bully, and hype up his own player. The kids are neck and neck, each hitting impressive shots. The kid is still unable to drive the ball and shooter taunts them. The bully is playing really well. Shooter complains to the tournament staff about happy\u2019s live-streaming being unfair and happy/shooter get pulled into a meeting at the 9th hole intermission/break. The staff say happy can\u2019t livestream anymore, which brings an expletive laced rant from happy. The kids remain neck and neck through the 15th hole, where happy\u2019s kid is starting to struggle because the crowd is quiet and respectful. Happy has to remind the kid of their \u201chappy place\u201d training. The kid tries to find their happy place but is unsuccessful. Happy starts live-streaming again to hype up the kid and the crowd, trying to level the playing field. The kid performs better and this causes happy and shooter to escalate their barbs/quips to actual physical fighting. They roll around while everyone tapes it on their phone. The bully taunts the kid and they continue the game. Happy and shooter get escorted off by police, both in handcuffs, shooter yelling \u201cdon\u2019t you know who I am?\u201d And happy silent. Happy says \u201cit\u2019s all yours now kid, you got this.\u201d \n\nThe kid gets angry and utilizes that anger to drive the ball onto/near the 18th green. The bully is shocked and thrown off, allowing the kid to take the lead. The bully sinks their next shot and it\u2019s down to the kid being able to hit a precision putt. The crowd is quiet but the kid hypes them up. The kid smiles, relaxes, and holds chubbs\u2019 wooden finger. The kid nails the putt. The kid wins the tournament and the bully runs off in shame. Cut to the club house, happy and shooter have been bailed out, and happy and shooter have a final moment where they settle their bet. Shooter begrudgingly says happy is the best pro golfer to ever play and happy thanks him, grinning. Shooter swears that he is going to practice for the next year and that in one years time, shooter will challenge happy for a rematch bet with the same stakes. Happy agrees and says bring it on. The tournament staff say that they would be interested in hosting, realizing the monetary potential. Movie ends as the group celebrates the win, the camera pans out as we watch shooters car pull out of the parking lot.",

Same characters and all but just do a complete shift in genre and tone. Like Happy Gilmore 2 can be about the common struggle of athletes when they reach success, Happy is a hall of famer but is basically penniless, a depressing sellout, never got his anger issues under control, Julie Bowens character left him because he kept cheating on her, hes on drugs and the movie is about him struggling with his comeback. Maybe Shooter McGavin is actually rich, and a commentator that constantly shits on Happy for his failures or something. Just make it really fucking depressing until the end where you can maybe crack one joke.\n\n\n\nFor Waterboy make it about Adam Sandlers son trying to be a top football player at a high-school while working at a job and attract top scouts because he wants to pay for Bobby's treatment for CTE/TBI with his NIL money. But while he has Bobby's talent for hitting people, he actually hates playing football.\n\n\n\nI wish any comedian would do a complete shift in genre/tone for unnecessary comedy movies, just because.",
