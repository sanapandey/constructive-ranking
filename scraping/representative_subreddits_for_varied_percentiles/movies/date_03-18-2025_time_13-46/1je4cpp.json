It's similar to the Twilight Saga; it's filled with actors who you assume are just bad actors, but then you see many of them in other projects and it's the case where, no, the actors CAN be good, they just need the right director and the right writers to bring it out. \n\nNow, of course, some actors are just bad, but some actors need the right film to showcase their talents. \n\nIt's not that Dakota's the best actor out there or one of the top ones, but she's much better than her most famous roles make her out to be.",
