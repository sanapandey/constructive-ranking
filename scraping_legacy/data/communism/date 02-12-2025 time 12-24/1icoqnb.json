I don't live in Russia or near the British Library, as I'm in Finland, so this tells me that perhaps, for whatever reason, these works of hers are not widely available, especially not in English. It's just interesting because I know for a fact her books and articles on Finland, which made her so respected as part of the Russian Social Democrat Party, were translated into many languages, and Kollontai herself was fluent in English. I wonder what databases her biographers and researchers have been utilizing to translate from any originals... Nonetheless, thank you so so much. I have a friend who grew up in Russia that may be able to help me parse some of the Russian language content you dug up. I really appreciate it!",

It took me like 30 minutes on my smartphone to find all these.\n\n\nObviously, you can't read everything and this is only worth so much effort but if you're investigating a narrow historical question or just want to read the other side of an old polemic it can really be worthwhile. We shouldn't leave these sources to the abuse of bourgeois academics.\n\n\nAdditionally, I figured there might be others reading this post who would be interested, and in the future anyone searching for Kollontai's early works might stumble upon this post and it would save them the further effort of digging for them.",

I was actually able to find a scan of My Heart Belongs to the Finnish Poor translated into English on a graphically artistic pamphlet; I even ordered a physical copy. You can find a scan of it here: [https://www.rabrab.net/titles/kollontai](https://www.rabrab.net/titles/kollontai) \n\nUpon further investigation, I think I might have misspoke on the nature of her early work on Finland as a Social Democrat, in the sense that although it did reportedly established her as an expert among her RSDLP comrades on the \"Finnish question\", they may not have been translated into as many languages as I claimed. From her bio on marxists.org:\n\n\"In 1900, Kollontai's first articles on Finland appeared. For the next 20 years, she was generally recognized as the RSDLP's foremost expert on the 'Finnish question', writing two books and numerous articles, as well as serving as advisor to RSDLP members in the Tsarist Duma and liaison with Finnish revolutionaries.\"\n\nIt makes sense, therefore, that this material primarily remain in its original Russian.\n\nThis chapter from Bolshevik Feminist: The Life of Aleksandra Kollontai and its bibliography give a lot of detail on her exhaustive analysis on Finland from a Marxist perspective (or at least, more in English than I've been able to find otherwise): [https://publish.iupress.indiana.edu/read/bolshevik-feminist-the-life-of-aleksandra-kollontai/section/492bad7d-eb44-404e-92da-88430b005d87](https://publish.iupress.indiana.edu/read/bolshevik-feminist-the-life-of-aleksandra-kollontai/section/492bad7d-eb44-404e-92da-88430b005d87) I noticed that the bibliography seems particularly relevant from footnotes 7-19.\n\nThere was also a book published more recently by Cathy Porter, who translated some of her previously more niche and untranslated works - I don't know if it's directly relevant to Finland or not, but oddly it seems to no longer printed. It's called Writings from the Struggle, published 2021.\n\nFinally, I fully accept and understand your reasoning behind helping me in the first place, but I still felt it was of great service to a particularly niche interest that is unlikely to be sought out by very many people, so thank you for the time you spent nonetheless.",
