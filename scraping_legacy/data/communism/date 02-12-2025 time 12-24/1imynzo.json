    "selftext": "I've seen plenty of videos now of Chomsky slating the October revolution, the Bolsheviks, and Lenin. \n\nHe calls the Bolsheviks radically anti-Marxist, seemingly to put Marxists off them. \n\nHe calls the Bolshevik ruling party \"totalitarian\", \"dictatorial\", and \"anti-socialist\". And he is very well versed on the details of the revolution and the policies that followed, each of which he attributes to one of these evils. \n\nBut he never explains where these tendencies/qualities come from in terms of the material interests of the Bolsheviks; how the conditions of society produced Bolshevism, the October revolution, and how class struggle is involved in this, and so on. \n\nBear in mind that he also says that they were \"not communists at all\". So then he is more or less saying that the Bolshevik policies were not even an attempt to build communism (misguided or otherwise). But he doesn't say what their true aims were, let alone explain them dialectically. \n\nAnd the whole thing therefore is pure mysticism, no matter how many dates and events he memorises. And this is an extremely anti-Marxist way of analysing history. I think that you can, as a Marxist, aknowledge this fact while still maintaining scepticism about Bolshevism and the October Rev.  \n\nPeter Hitches (a hardline conservative anti Marxist) says (I'm quoting from memory here) \"Lenin was a German agent hired to turn Russia into a prison state.\" \n\nIn a way, that is much more Marxist than Chomsky because at least it explains things in terms of material interests. Hence I say that chomsky is not just anti-Marxist, but radically so. \n\nNow Chomsky doesn't claim to be Marxist himself I don't think, but if he appears as at least an ally of Marx infront of Marxists to abominate the October revolution, and then is woefully un Marxist in his analysis of the Bolshevik revolution and rule, I think there's a certain hypocracy in that. \n\nWhat do you think?\n\n\n\n",

            "body": "I'm not sure I would call Chomsky radically anything. His ideas are pretty puerile and belong to a different generation. For good or ill, Marxism-Leninism has reconstituted itself and has a complete program of ideas and worldview that is easily picked up and transmitted. This includes revisionism but the anti-communism of the 1990s is a thing of the past. Like maybe in 1993 pointing out that the two state solution was international law was mind blowing, I wouldn't know. But it's not now and we have the internet. We don't need this guy to present information to us and we can no longer overlook his flaws. \n\nLook, Parenti has his problems but I only react negatively to recommendations of his work because they are used lazily for revisionist purposes. But I will still engage with him. Is there anything to engage in Chomsky? I may be the last person who still remembers *Manufacturing Consent* and I even posted once explaining that the message is fundamentally misunderstood and the model misused by liberals. Parenti at least is understood and properly applied to today's revisionism.\n\nOP I agree that those videos are persistent enough to respond to. Your response is not great but neither are the videos. You don't have to guess or find material interest. Lenin was quite capable of explaining his own reasoning which you can read for free online. Chomsky himself says his criticism is not new, in fact it was happening while Lenin and Trotskyist and Stalin and others were alive and responding back.",

Why the distinction now?\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/14cuot1/comment/jopp4b8/",
