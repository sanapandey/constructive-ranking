Whether Trotsky's 'theory of permanent revolution' was a good medicine, I scoffed at Mao's Cultural Revolution, but now I think that perhaps Mao, like Trotsky, anticipated the corrosive effect of capitalism on the socialist countries, but there were big problems in its implementation.\n\n\uff08my poor English\uff0cforgive me\uff09",

            "body": "That is a temptation you must resist. Trotsky was opposed to Stalin as representative of the building of socialism in the USSR, which is why his arguments went from concrete policy disagreements to vague complaints about democracy. Mao on the other hand opposed Deng as representative of the restoration of capitalism, and they always disagreed on concrete measures with fundamentally different economic logic behind them.\n\nMany people in revisionist countries have discovered Trotsky because he seems to have predicted much of what came to pass. But that is only because his followers are not honest and exclude all the wrong predictions which are equally fundamental. The restoration of capitalism in the USSR in 1991 is not a vindication of Trotsky because he predicted it in 1945 (or even during the war). To say \"capitalism might eventually be restored\" is not really a prediction, or at least one that does not require Marxism (anyone could predict that backwards Russia, no matter how impressive its accomplishments, could be smothered by imperialism given enough time). This also required dishonestly representing one's own history, where decades of the Trotskyist movement capitulating to the permanence of the socialist bloc and the communist parties is erased and the sad remnants get to say \"we knew the whole time lol, that was \"Pabloism.\"\n\nSince the restoration of capitalism in China has taken a very different path, Trotskyism has no response, with most Trotskyists abandoning the concept of \"degenerated workers states\" entirely for whatever liberalism serves up and a minority clinging to it with absurd consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, the Maoist argument about the restoration of capitalism in 1956 directly correlates with the form capitalism took in China, where it did not need to abandon much of the political superstructure and took place in the party over concrete issues like the law of value, the collectivization of agriculture, and the state monopoly on foreign trade. Complaining about bureaucracy and international isolation are not very interesting. What is the causal element? Why do these elements seem to lead to both the vast expansion of socialism after the second world war and its contraction decades later? The explanations I have seen, as well as attempts to apply them to Trotskyism's own history, have not been very impressive.",

The selection \"Two Strategies of the Social Democratic Party in the Democratic Revolution\" said that after the proletariat won the democratic revolution, it should seize the opportunity to transition to the socialist revolution. I think this social revolution refers to the self-revolution of the proletariat similar to the Cultural Revolution, which maintains the purity of the proletariat. As for the Chinese textbooks describing the ten-year catastrophe of the Cultural Revolution, I think it was more discredited by people with ulterior motives. Local government officials (including the central government) did not strictly follow Mao's ideas. As for Trotsky, I have not learned about it. I don't know whether his continuous revolution is of the same nature as the Cultural Revolution.",
