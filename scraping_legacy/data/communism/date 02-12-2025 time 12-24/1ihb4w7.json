    "selftext": "Greetings to all from a post-Soviet country. I am a communist from Kyrgyzstan and here I want to learn more about Western comrades.\n\n\n\nI apologize in advance for my not-so-best English, I mainly plan to use Google Translate to communicate with foreign comrades, which may cause some miscommunication, but I think this is not the worst thing that can happen.\n\n\n\nIn general, I think everyone has some understanding of how they think in general, what problems and what kind of view on theory and modern capitalism communists from different countries have. But most likely everyone realizes that it is clearly distorted and without direct dialogue with communists of another country it is impossible to understand the overall picture.\n\n\n\nThis is why I am here, in particular, eliminating the blind spots in my perception of Western communists. I am also interested in learning and borrowing the techniques and practices that you resort to in the development of the left movement and what problems arise with this. Because I think everyone understands that, in total, the left is currently losing to the global fascism and the discussion about what we are doing right or wrong will not be useless.\n\n\n\nFor my part, I can answer questions about my post-Soviet country, the peculiarities of capitalism here and the problems, mistakes, etc. that we have here in an attempt to revive the left movement on the ruins of the USSR.",

They told me specifically that in Kyrgyzstan there are even some Lenin references. This gave me the impression that in the Central Asian countries, anti-communism ideology is not so prevalent. What do you think about that?\n\nI made a very simple [description](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/s/DkAlLPlpk2) about the movement in my country, in case you're interested.\n\n\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0442\u0438\u043a \u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043c",

Perhaps this is due to the greater nostalgic attachment to the achievements of socialism and a much more distinct difference in living conditions before and after the collapse of the USSR.\n\nOtherwise, both the pro-government political agenda and the neoliberal opposition strive to abolish everything connected and related to the Soviet past and assign it the labels of colonialism identical to the period of the Russian Empire.\n\nAnd every year such an agenda becomes more aggressive and evil.",

I remember central Asia being the most loyal to the soviet government part of the USSR (as by the referendum of 1991, they voted for saving the USSR, not for separation). I personally think that it is because central Asia was a colony and got basically uplifted by communists, and while eastern European countries had sentiments for the same prosperity as western Europe, central Asia had never had anyone besides the soviet government, so the trust was immense.\n\nBut it also could be because central Asia (and now i will talk mostly about kyrgyzstan assuming that the other countries share more or less the same idea) has never had advanced politics. People just don't get involved in politics and, moreover, don't really think about capitalism, communism, and how things work with each other. There are very few people who actively get involved in politics, and so far, they are liberal populists continuing the current course. \n\nThere are also young people who actively speak about politics, but they are the same ol' young blood like in any other countries with, at times, extreme young maximalism and shallow understanding.",

My dad is a centrist and my mum is a strong supporter of Blairite Labour. \n\nAround the time of the \"Arab spring\" I had a flirtation with Islam. I had no sense that I had comrades worldwide and Islam definitely gave me this.\n\nI was then a liberal atheist - Christopher Hitchens was my idol. I also liked Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris. I tried to be leftist/Marxist because it was fashionable, and had no genuine interest in it really. \n\nI then got into Alan Watts and Krishnamurti, as well as psychedelics. And then I became an anarchist spiritualist.\n\nThen I voted for Brexit and sort of moved to right populism and hated all of the hypocrisy of the mainstream left. I started getting deep into illuminati type theories and was a big follower of David Icke. \n\nThen during COVID I returned to the David Icke and Alex jones stuff big time because I could see that the COVID policies were nothing to do with health, and were to encroach on freedom, and that there was a global conspiracy of the Elite. I stayed in the right populist camp. But I still understood communal stateless society as an ideal to pursue, and I wasn't so against Marx either. But I certainly saw all socialist societies in history as an illuminati-controlled prison system. Also totally against communist revolution. \n\nI moved to Poland to escape the more draconian COVID policies of the UK. My thinking was that because they had lived through a harsh system of repression under communism, they were immune to it.\n\nBut when I came to Poland I was surprised. I saw how the blocks were designed to foster communities spending time with each other and discussing things. At that time, pubs were closed, everyone was under house arrest, and I could see exactly that it was to stop us coming together and discussing things. I noticed that around the blocks people were socialising and kids playing, and that this-- the communist housing policy -- was one of the things making Poland more resilient to the onslaught of coronafascism. \n\nThen I started reading more and more from Marxist Leninists on Twitter, and saw that their analyses were way superiour to anyone else. I also swallowed a few tough pills about what it would take to make society better and defeat fascism, namely class war and socialism. That was over 3 years ago. I then read Lenin's Imperialism, and was blown away. So much of the political knowledge that can be found in Lenin, is now monopolised by right-populist channels (at least where I come from). The idea of a financial monopoly/oligarchy is exclusively a RW talking point.\n\nI then read most of the first volume of Capital. \n\nIt still took me a while to see the Russian Revolution in a good light, but I got there with careful consideration and historical research.\n\nMy question for you is what are the current political trends among young people and older people in Kyrgyzstan?",

I stayed in the right populist camp. But I still understood communal stateless society as an ideal to pursue, and I wasn't so against Marx either.

My thinking was that because they had lived through a harsh system of repression under communism, they were immune to it.\n\n\nAs the above shows, you have quite the track record of recognizing exceptional insight.\n\n\n>Plenty of Marxists are writing about post capitalist class society.
