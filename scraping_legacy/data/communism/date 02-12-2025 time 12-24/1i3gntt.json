Behind these witty expressions lies a profound truth: openness, exchange and mutual appreciation are the unchanging themes of mankind and the heartfelt desire of people from all countries.\"",

It seems to be rehashing the sort of Globalization era \"once we get to know each other, we'll all get along\" rhetoric that belies one of the most profound period exploitation of the global south. While there is some satisfaction to be had in seeing China be the touchbearer of this sort of 90s cosmopolitan globalization liberalism, and the US being in the position it has been painting all the people in its naughty list, as hamfistedly erecting an American \"great wall\" around its internet, being overly censorious, and \"backwardly reacting to the inevitable wave of globalization\", we, as Marxists, should study the underlying material conditions that has led to a deterioration of America soft and hard power such that America has retreated from precisely this sort of Globalized World rhetoric and are on the defense, as it were.",

The question of coexistence, particularly in our day, interests literally every man and woman on the globe.   \n  \nWe all of us well know that tremendous changes have taken place in the world. Gone, indeed, are the days when it took weeks to cross the ocean from one continent to the other or when a trip from Europe to America, or from Asia to Africa, seemed a very complicated undertaking. The progress of modern technology has reduced our planet to a rather small place; it has even become, in this sense, quite congested. And if in our daily life it is a matter of considerable importance to establish normal relations with our neighbors in a densely inhabited settlement, this is so much the more necessary in the relations between states, in particular states belonging to different social systems.   \n  \nYou may like your neighbor or dislike him. You are not obliged to be friends with him or visit him. But you live side by side, and what can you do if neither you nor he has any desire to quit the old home and move to another town? All the more so in relations between states. It would be unreasonable to assume that you can make it so hot for your undesirable neighbor that he will decide to move to Mars or Venus. And vice versa, of course.   \n  \nWhat, then, remains to be done? There may be two ways out: either war \u2014 and war in the rocket and Hbomb age is fraught with the most dire consequences for all nations \u2014 or peaceful coexistence.\"\n\n  \n[https://www.cvce.eu/en/obj/on\\_peaceful\\_coexistence\\_from\\_foreign\\_affairs\\_october\\_1959-en-a231db94-ad9e-430c-8b61-12354f373ffc.html](https://www.cvce.eu/en/obj/on_peaceful_coexistence_from_foreign_affairs_october_1959-en-a231db94-ad9e-430c-8b61-12354f373ffc.html)",
