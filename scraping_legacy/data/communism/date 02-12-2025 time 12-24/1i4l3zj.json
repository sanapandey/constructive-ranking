I feel like this new Chinese Deepseek AI is a turning point where Dengism is now becoming liberal common sense. I was wondering what would emerge from Trump's second term now that Sanders social fascism is non-existent and it appears the idea that America is useless in every way whereas China is a perfectly harmonious, meritocratic, and efficient society is too compelling. Coupled with the recent fantasies of young liberals going onto Chinese social media apps after the banning of tiktok and being \"deprogrammed\" through communication with Chinese people, older anti-communism no longer works (I'm thinking of the crude attempt to ban \"CCP propaganda\" on r/antiwork, although it's hard to tell how much of this is a genuine reaction by the user base and how much is competing brigades) and it no longer requires taking a position on \"Marxism-Leninism\" to decide that China is the technocratic dream of liberalism deferred in the US.\n\nI never thought I would see the day where Michael Roberts is reposting Moon of Alabama articles on Facebook or the only counter to China's technical accomplishment is \"AI sucks anyway\" rather than a serious engagement with the AI global value chain. There was a period in the late 2010s when a bunch of really good works came out about imperialism and China and they invigorated me for a few years. Now there's nothing and I lack the discipline to not have an opinion on issues that older works do not explain in an obvious way. Whatever delaying effect support for Russian fascism had on making Dengism repulsive has waned, the desire to stick it to Trump by predicting his inevitable humiliation by the genius of Xi Jinping is just too tempting.\n\nAnyway, the good news is if the Western \"left\" is capitulating, the seeming one man effort to translate Chinese Maoist works on bannedthought has created a good list of things to read. I think that's the only thing to do.",

And the ACP, or whatever emerges, could end up being a problem that goes beyond just people who call themselves socialist.  Though I'm a bit skeptical -- with the rising German Empire in the build up to WW1 as the main rival to Britain, there was never a pro-Kaiser or German-sympathetic faction which manifested in England, wishing for them to become more like the industrial marvel that was Germany (even Kautsky's logic didn't find support there, the British members of the Second International sided with the Entente).  Though there was plenty of amerikan support for Germany.  But then again, British nationalism was still young and fresh and \"healthy\" in the run up to the war, where amerikan nationalism today has become a rotting self-parody, (except to fascists, who envision themselves as the restoration), and now that Trump is back, amerikan liberals are ashamed, and all their attempts to reclaim amerikan patriotism backfired, as was expected.\n\nedit: there was no edit, just accidently pressed save",

                            "body": "While the pro-Russia, anti-China far right exists on the fringes of the Republican party, it has some influence as thought leaders and organizing the shock troops of fascism. The Democrats have so far resisted attempts to create a pro-China, anti-Russia equivalent (in favor of peace, free trade, and liberal factions in the CCP), although this position is equally as logical as the former. Instead, the Democrats continue to present themselves as the party of order and Dengism can take the form of broad \"anti-imperialism\" which avoids the question of Russia. Can this survive another Trump term, now without any central figure of \"resistance?\" I am mostly wondering what form social fascism will take now that every previous form has withered away, though perhaps I am overestimating Dengism given it is a mere copy of fascist discourse applied \"ironically\" (e.g.\"what if we called the right cucks?\"). For all that I find interesting about the ACP as a phenomenon, it's notable that the actual people involved are all losers.\n\nIf this position develops, calling it \"Marxism\" is probably a bridge too far for US liberalism (although it's possible in countries with surviving communist parties of some influence) so I doubt the ACP would survive the transition. You're right about how far this can go though, Biden is probably the closest we'll get to trying to create an American equivalent to Chinese state subsidies for industry and it was a pathetic failure. As it disappears so will the usefulness of propaganda about the \"Green New Deal\" and the \"most pro-labor president\" and such. Again, I'm just not sure what will replace it. \n\nYour historical point is well taken but there is unfortunately an equivalent: the fascination of European communists with America. Because the US lacked a feudal past, it was seen as the purest, most vital expression of capitalism and bourgeois democracy and the Frankfurt school is just one example of European Marxism falling victim to these illusions. For those of us who've had to rescue the concept of settler-colonialism from obscurity and insist on the black national thesis, this whole lineage of thought was flawed. Settler-colonialism and slavery are not better than feudalism, they are merely different, and this is one of the fundamental problems with applying the term \"fascism\" to the US (or rather why the US never quite seems to be fascist given the notable features come out of German, Italian, and Japanese feudalism). The same relationship exists today towards China as the perfect form of capitalism because its socialist revolution purged it of all pre-capitalist vestiges, up to private land ownership, parliamentary democracy, and market anarchy. In reality capitalism lacks basic legitimacy in China so all that exists is naked corruption at the everyday level and a weak ideology of \"growth\" to support the status quo. But that doesn't impact fantasies, even if you visit China you're going to see a functional East Asian capitalism in the major cities (that, luckily for you, throw jobs at English speakers and under qualified foreigners), not the reality of Chinese life for the large majority in minor cities and the countryside where petty local government, rich bourgeois princelings, and mafia enforcers rule.\n\nE: I see u/Far_Permission_8659 already said what I wanted to say but better. Still, there is more to say on this subject since, as they imply, the conflation of sympathy with Vietnam and \"the left\" is taken for granted but highly suspect. It was Noam Chomsky who pointed out that the end of the war came largely from business factions (not to deny the primary role of Vietnamese resistance, only the role of the Western social democratic movement as a component of it). In fact the timelines don't really add up, anti-war politics became a central element only in 1968 when it was clear the war was lost and were mostly a reaction to the pointless escalation of Nixon in Cambodia and his betrayal of the promise to end the war (made for the bourgeoisie, not student protestors). Communists were obviously enchanted by opportunity and saw in this a broad social movement that could make revolution. But when it didn't happen there was no self-reflection, just nostalgia or delusion. There simply never was an engagement with the history of American right-wing anti-imperialism and settler-colonialism, European concepts were simply transplanted.\n\nSimilarly, the contemporary \"anti-imperialist\" movement only came into existence beyond the fringes after what it was opposing had already passed. Nearly all of its figures were in favor of Obama-era imperialism (including in Syria and Libya, you can go back and find their tweets) and are really a post-Trump phenomenon, parasitically dependent on right wing American isolationism. But unlike in the past, the right is much stronger (or at least more politically creative), if Moon of Alabama is a thought leader of Dengism, that is because they also rant about \"DEI,\" taking the final step towards ideological consistency with their class interest. On the other hand Michael Roberts convinces no one, not even his own comment section, and has stopped even putting in the Trotskyist cynicism at the end of his posts that for all it's success, China is not socialist because it lacks democracy or whatever. His comment section has fully bought into neo-Confucian Orientalism about the provincialism of such ideas (regardless of what you thought about the useless debates about the Grundrisse that used to be there, sometimes these were great debates between real scholars like John Smith - now it's worse than reddit).",

This stratum has many reasons to attempt protectionist measures in order to safeguard any global competition (much of Euro-Amerikan industry is deliberately archaic in order to sustain a settler base) which would outcompete these \u201clocal businesses\u201d.\n\nOn a more broad level, this direction of a convergence between natbourg nativism and social fascist \u201cautarky\u201d was predicted by [MIM](https://www.prisoncensorship.info/archive/etext/mt/imp97/imp97c3.html) quite incisively.\n\n>In any case, the U.$. government\u2019s extra anti-communist fear of economic planning places it at a disadvantage relative to Japan, Europe and state-capitalist China which are more willing to use planning for bourgeois ends. \u201cIn the economy that grew the fastest in Europe in the 1980s, that of Spain, government-owned firms produce at least half of the GDP. In France and Italy the state sector accounts for one-third of GNP.\u201d (150) Whether the United $tates can avoid taking up an \u201cindustrial policy\u201d and \u201cmanaged trade\u201d if Europe and Japan decide to go forward is difficult to say. For ideological reasons, the United $tates may continue to put forward that the ownership of profits is what matters, not where the workers are employed. If foreign imperialists own a large share of the U.$. economy, such a position may not even hurt the labor aristocracy. On the other hand, the pattern of not caring about history and statistics in trade allows the U.$. administration the flexibility to change policy. U.$. practice has been to bring in a succession of know-nothings to head trade policy, as if to underscore that there is no science of trade. When one official threatened government subsidies to match Airbus subsidies in Europe, no one believed him, because of U.$. individualism.(151) However, a change of administration and faces could conceivably change that.\n\n\u2026\n\n>Of particular concern to MIM in the United $tates is the possibility of a national socialist movement led wittingly or unwittingly by the likes of Pat Choate, the CP-USA and the social-democrats of the DSA ilk. Choate admits that the United $tates does all the things Japan does abroad and also admits that U.$. politicians can be bought by anyone, not just the Japanese. For this reason, he spends 99 percent of his time bashing Japan, and 1 percent of his time admitting the flaws of capitalism and U.$. imperialism in particular.(153) He claims to be in favor of removing all influence-peddling, not just Japan\u2019s. Under the pressure of Japanese competition, Choate even admits something we communists have been saying about imperialist investment for decades, except he applies it not to a colony but to the United $tates! \u201cOf the 677,000 jobs that foreign investors claim to have created in 1988, only 34,000\u2013a mere 5 percent\u2014were created by the establishment of new foreign-owned operations in the United States. The other 95 percent were made up of existing jobs in U.S. companies that were taken over by foreign investors.\u201d(154) We want to know where was Choate all these years when that needed to be said about U.$. investment in the Third World.",

The modern tariff regimen is basically a version of the sanctions regime that the Biden presidency used, except under a coat of nativism and consequent push for reindustrialization (which is a legacy of Sanderism). Even the government remodeling is just the austerity regime pointed inward.\n\n>Why even call them natbourg? What\u2019s the usefulness of the term here?\n\nI think there\u2019s a significant difference in political manifestation between Amerikan companies that work predominantly within their borders (that is, Euro-Amerika), those who predominantly export capital to internal colonies, and those who export capital outside of the broad Amerikan borders. You\u2019re correct that these aren\u2019t really differences in relation to production (all of the above strata are completely reliant on imperialism to exist as such), but the apportioning of surplus value is a significant and often primary contradiction within Euro-Amerika that necessitates differentiating these groups.\n\nAs the rate of profit declines, accelerated by global competition, this has severe effects on the ability for all of these groups to sustain themselves and they look to the others to jettison. The Euro-Amerikan petty bourgeoisie and \u201cnational bourgeoisie\u201d are especially precarious in this relationship due to their pronounced inefficiency and cost. Not only does this make them highly dependent on government loans and subsidies, but they are also especially susceptible to [crises of finance capital](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378426622002709).\n\nI\u2019m happy to change the term to describe this, though, since you\u2019re right that this is distinct from the traditional national bourgeoisie. Maybe it would be better to say the national imperialist bourgeoisie, although I\u2019m open to suggestions.",

In fact, American liberal opinion before Trump's fame had much more pro-China \u201crise of Asia\u201d \u201cperfectly harmonized bureaucratic state of meritocracy\u201d rhetoric.\n\nAnd you're too convinced that ideological shifts need to follow logic, evidence, emotion or reason rather than the economic needs of the ruling class. While there are more of these reasons to believe in Dengism now, it is precisely for this reason that it is all the more necessary for the ruling class of U.S. imperialism to get their liberal cultural elite servants to oppose this. Consider that currently American liberals are already competing with American conservatives over who is better able to oppose China, rather than advocating compromise with China as they did 10 years ago.\n\nOf course, anything can happen, it's just a matter of odds. But the idea that some form of victory by Xi over Trump is enough to make American liberals change their views, or that the main obstacle to American liberal support for Xi is Putin rather than the confrontation between imperialism and the relative decline of the United States itself, is clearly unfounded, idealist and unlikely to be correct.\n\nAnd as a Maoist, I don't think that such a \u201ccapitulation\u201d would be a bad thing for the if it did happen, because it would increase the pool of potentially effective recruits. Dengists are actually more likely to be recruited as Maoists than liberals in general. Of course, I'm not a party management bureaucrat, so this is none of my business.\n\nAnd as an data science practitioner myself, I don't think the \u201cAI value chain\u201d exists or matters, or that there is somewhat \u201cXi Jinping's genius\u201d. From the beginning, these narratives have been nothing more than a hoax designed to inflate the price of US tech stocks. The only \u201cproblem\u201d that has arisen so far is that some Chinese startups are actually serious about developing real products like DeepSeek, accidentally shattering the illusion many Computer engineers has found from the beginning.\n\nIn any case, even if the industry does make as much sense as the layman thinks it does, the U.S. can always treat China the same way it treats Chinese electric cars and solar panels, or the Chinese AI industry the same way the U.S. treats TikTok or China treats Google, and so the problem is once again simplified to the likelihood of imperialist wars instead of the liberal intellectual elites who always follow their masters of finance capital and change their meaningless color",

You may respond that most Dengists are too ignorant to have an opinion on the revolution in the Philippines but you're just proposing the same liberal cynicism where people are just blank slates to be manipulated into your position. Even the term Maoist has become suspect as Dengists try to colonize it, I do not necessarily trust your claim to it.\n\n>American liberal opinion before Trump's fame had much more pro-China \u201crise of Asia\u201d \u201cperfectly harmonized bureaucratic state of meritocracy\u201d rhetoric.\n\nI don't think that's true at all, China was understood in those terms as on the path to \"democracy\" based on the experience of the late Soviet Union and China's embrace of free trade had no place in the anti-globalisation left. Where are you getting this from?\n\nThe rest of your post is confused, sorry. We're discussing a fraction of liberalism, known as Dengism, which is finally making inroads into mainstream discourse. No one is arguing that mainstream liberal politicians will start advocating for Chinese capitalism, that's absurd. The issue is whether resistance within the terms of liberalism, i.e. social fascism, takes the form of Dengism.\n\nAs for the AI value chain, that AI is largely a parlor trick that's been revealed to have a rotten foundation is true, as is the inflation of stock prices in a bubble. But this does not mean the purpose was to inflate stock prices, that's not a cause. The purpose was to find a commercial application for the West's very real monopolistic advantage in semiconductors. That this attempt failed only makes the need for a real application more desperate. While you're right this will lead to imperialist wars as the defense of last resort, this is not a simple problem except in the crude sense of politics only caring about events. But again, you're being cynical, we are human beings with scientific curiosity about how the industry actually works and the nature of technology and this is important to predicting when inter-imperialist war will occur and what form it will take. It's not sufficient to dismiss every particularity as just a superficial manifestation towards the same underlying endpoint even if it's abstractly the case.",

And it is clear that Dengists do take a position and are not ignorant, but know something that is completely wrong. You don't seem to know what I believe.\u00a0\n\nDespite the fact that I'm not actually a former Dengist myself, and have instead been an permanent opponent of them, I've seen more ex-conservatives than ex-liberals among people who call themselves Maoists. That's not much of a valid sample, of course. Still, even if you think that Dengists are just a form of liberalism, they are clearly a form of liberalism closer to Maoism.\u00a0\n\nIt's also not \u201cliberal\u201d to believe that people can be manipulated into various positions and liberal culture elites change their ideas based on what their bourgeoisie masters want. That's exactly what Marxism is, and that's one of the reasons why the economic base determines the superstructure and \"the ideas of the ruling class are, in any age, the ruling ideas\"\n\nBtw, there's really nothing wrong with being cynical though, it's just being realistic and critical of the world. And it's true that you don't need to trust anyone's statements about their position, because people are basically incapable of even recognizing their own positions, but you seem to lack self-awareness about that.\n\nYou probably don't have empirical knowledge of liberal rhetoric prior to 2015/2016/2018 when there was much more brag about China (especially before Xi) and I was talking about liberals, not leftists. Also, leaving aside for a moment that your inability to understand and accept doesn't mean I'm confused in my conversation, what I'm saying is that what you consider to be part of the Dengist talking points were actually more popular before. And, its almost unlikely that if it changes, it will happen in the form and for the reasons you stated.\n\nIncidentally, liberalism is not quite the same as socio-fascism, since the mainstream wing of it doesn't even have the pretense of the \u201csocial\u201d part of it. Socio-fascist is the correct description of Sanders and his fans, but the mainstream of the Democratic Party is basically just Hindenburg and Schacht, not SPD.\n\nOnce again, you're mistakenly assuming that there are real large-scale sales of AI-related hardware, while assuming that I'm just criticizing the software part of it as unreliable. If you look at the financial statements, you will see that this \u201cgold rush\u201d only exists on the financial statements of NVDA and SMCI. The latter has been proven to be largely false, while the former is more optimistic than the latter. It's just financial fakery and manipulation, and there aren't even many real hardware deals. In short, the triumph of DeepSeek's not-so-smart approach likely comes basically from the fact that they actually tried genuinely to develop anything real in the midst of a massive scam.\n\nAnd not to mention that \u201ccuriosity\u201d is not part of any non-existent \u201chuman nature\u201d, the result of my curiosity and research inspired by NVDA fans is to point out that it doesn't make sense. So much so that it doesn't even affect the relative specifics of imperialist warfare you mentioned - and it's actually inherently hard to predict those details so I just ignored that.\n\n\nEdit: typos",

Both the old idea \u2013 held by Kautsky among others \u2013 that organization was the precondition of revolutionary action, and that of Rosa Luxemburg that it is a product of the revolutionary mass movement, appear one-sided and undialectical. Because it is the party\u2019s function to prepare the revolution, it is \u2013 simultaneously and equally \u2013 both producer and product, both precondition and result of the revolutionary mass movement. For the party\u2019s conscious activity is based on clear recognition of the objective inevitability of the economic process; it\u2019s strict organizational exclusiveness is in constant fruitful interaction with the instinctive struggles and sufferings of the masses. Rosa Luxemburg sometimes came near an appreciation of this element of interaction, but she ignored the conscious and active element in it. That is why she was incapable of understanding the vital point of the Leninist party concept \u2013 the party\u2019s preparatory role \u2013 and why she was bound grossly to misinterpret all the organizational principles which followed from it. The revolutionary situation itself can naturally not be a product of party activity. The party\u2019s role is to foresee the trajectory of the objective economic forces and to forecast what the appropriate actions of the working class must be in the situation so created. In keeping with this foresight, it must do as much as possible to prepare the proletarian masses intellectually, materially, and organizationally both for what lies ahead and how their interests relate to it. However, the actual events themselves and the situations which subsequently arise from them are a result of the economic forces of capitalist production, working themselves out blindly and according to their own natural laws -though not, even then, with mechanistic fatality.\n\n\u2026\n\n> The immense demands which Lenin\u2019s concept of party organization made upon professional revolutionaries were not in themselves Utopian, nor did they naturally have much connection with the superficiality of ordinary life. They were not concerned with the immediate facts; they went beyond mere empiricism. Lenin\u2019s concept of organization is in itself dialectical: it is both a product of and a conscious contributor to, historical development in so far as it, too, is simultaneously product and producer of itself Men themselves build a party. A high degree of class-consciousness and devotion is required in order to want and to be capable of working in a party organization at all. However, only by being so organized and by working through a party can men become real professional revolutionaries.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/lukacs/works/1924/lenin/ch03.htm\n\nMIM(P) deciding to declare themselves the vanguard party and organize as such won\u2019t build a revolution from thin air. They also don\u2019t use the lack of revolution as an excuse to do nothing at all. They see themselves as taking a shape appropriate to the current situation, from which a vanguard may arise with a change in conditions.\n\nSo I think your critique needs to go further than pointing to the form without explaining further why you think their justification for that form is incorrect. I think if they could just change into a vanguard party and suddenly solve their problems, they would have.",

Instead he (allegedly) worked alone in a lone wolf attack against one CEO who was immediately replaced, with other CEOs quickly pivoting to protect themselves. Letting his words speak for themselves and showcase this outlook should be a first step. Then, struggling with workers who view him positively, explaining the class character of his actions and what a principled proletarian offensive could look like that builds off of what people view as successes and failures in his (alleged) actions, seems to us to be the logical next step with regards to how we relate to this.",

I don't even think the charge of adventurism or terrorism can be applied meaningfully, because Mangione and their sympathizers do not want to expand healthcare to the oppressed of the world but just within the U$.\n\nThere is nothing positive to glean from this action beyond acknowledging some innovative methods used that can be replicated and rising the social fascism and fascism. The shift in focus away from the character of these sympathies toward armed struggle in the abstract tails behind social fascist demands and organization(which opportunist strands of oppressed communities within the U$ support). The Palestinian resistance, rightly, does not praise or rely on \"left\" and right opposition within the Zionist entity to draw lessons for their struggle despite their successful sabotage(which ironically comes from the right far more). In the U$, this should apply even more given how this country is the strongest imperialist power in the world with a vast petty-bourgeois that extends into nationally oppressed communities. Even the 2020 Uprisings, arguably the one of the most radical outbursts in recent times, had severe problems due to the class character of it's resistance and leadership... how can Mangione and their sympathizers be not only not be characterized as social fascist/fascist but discussed more \"extensively\" than the 2020 Uprisings for lessons to glean and to monopolize on some perceived \"radical energies\"?\n\nFrom my view, communists should not be celebrating this or criticizing this as if there was a just problem amongst fellow \"anti-capitalists\", but looking at how to combat the rising social fascist and fascist movements. The healthcare system within the U$, despite it's severe inefficiency, is one of the best and most segregated in the entire world. A revolutionary program would tackle the massive healthcare disparity globally caused by imperialism and of some classes/sections of nationally oppressed communities here. In the short to medium term, this would threaten and reduce the quality of healthcare for the vast majority of the U$. There is no way to reconcile this demand \"universal\" healthcare and the struggle against capitalism-imperialism, any attempt to do so is social-fascist.",

[...] The misunderstandings and confusion here can easily lend itself into organizing on a social-fascist basis.\n\nReading the criticisms that have been posted so far, I'll be upfront in saying that this is a very fair question to ask, one which what we've published so far has been insufficient in answering. Issue 3 was published on a much shorter timetable than the previous two regular issues. In hindsight, we should have given it more breathing room and included the planned elaboration and critique of Mangione's manifesto up-front.\n\n>The biggest confusion I have is the use of working-class, racialized. and queer as categories without much further analysis/elaboration.\n\nPart of this is because we simply haven't existed very long. Our understanding of \"working class\" is as a descriptor of people with a particular relation to production, specifically those who subsist by selling their labor to the bourgeois classes (venture capitalists, landlords, petty bourgeoisie, etc.). Though this relationship broadly describes all workers, not all workers equally experience the antagonism with the bourgeoisie inherent to that relationship due to the objective economic realities of imperialism compounded with material advantages and disadvantages produced by racialization and other processes by which economic subjugation and unequal exchange were given the guise of \"natural\" codified hierarchies. In the US this has produced a massive labor aristocracy and petty bourgeoisie fiercely loyal to the settler project.\n\nTo expand on racialization and other similar processes: in the case of race, a fundamentally *economic* relationship (colonization and enslavement) that finances the quality of life which Euro-America enjoys is *naturalized as race* by the bourgeois classes and the labor aristocracy. Likewise in the case of gender, the systematic confiscation of women's property and their enduring political and economic disenfranchisement was naturalized first on religious grounds and then \"scientifically\" as modern \"scientific\" sexism. A key difference between these categories is that class describes an objective condition that deeply affects the subjectivity of each individual, while things like \"identity\" (race, gender, etc.) describe a subjectivity that both affects and is affected by that objective condition. In this way, we have to reject the idea pushed by some \"communists\" that race, gender, even nation are \"distractions\" or simply illusions cast to mask the \"real problem\". Quite the opposite, they are expressions of class and class struggle stamped with the brand of the classes that molded them to suit their needs. The particularities of these must be grasped to have any real understanding of class and class struggle anywhere, let alone in the US, and likewise understanding the class struggle here gives us the means to more deeply understand these particularities. \n\n>I hope that there can be some dialogue/clarification around this. Since I have skepticism about tenant organizing without clear political leadership or direction[...]\n\nWe very much welcome dialogue on this, and hope to see other Maoists engage with this in practice as well. It's our understanding that we aren't the only Maoists involved in tenant organizing, with folks in the Omaha Tenant Union also claiming to be MLM. To be clear: we do not view tenant organizing as some untapped magic bullet which will bring us revolution. The sad reality that we have firsthand experience with is that economism remains rife within the movement, and we will have more to report soon on traitorous union leadership where we're at. However, we maintain that\n\n>the present role of Maoists in the tenant movement [is] learning from the practices shown to be successful by these unions (linking up with the tenant masses in the process), uniting with communist tenant leadership (which exists at every level of TUF) in order to advance the land struggle along revolutionary lines, and struggling against elements which seek to de-politicize the struggle and divert these unions back into advocacy and aid work.\n\nAdvancing the land struggle in this instance doesn't simply mean the formal ownership of housing by all tenants. It means the organization of complexes primarily occupied by the nationally oppressed into a network of semi-independent communal structures which can act as militant base areas for increasingly advanced struggle in the cities. Regardless of formal legal ownership (though we aren't in principle opposed to this *where possible in the short term*) these tenants can *de facto* control and utilize it towards revolutionary ends. This isn't a concept unique to us, the BLA elaborated on this previously to some extent in their Study Guide.",

On Note 16, Marx says:\n\n>In order to prove that labour alone is that all-sufficient and real measure, by which at all times the value of all commodities can be estimated and compared, Adam Smith says, \u201cEqual quantities of labour must at all times and in all places have the same value for the labourer. In his normal state of health, strength, and activity, and with the average degree of skill that he may possess, he must always give up the same portion of his rest, his freedom, and his happiness.\u201d (\u201cWealth of Nations,\u201d b. I. ch. V.) On the one hand Adam Smith here (but not everywhere) confuses the determination of value by means of the quantity of labour expended in the production of commodities, with the determination of the values of commodities by means of the value of labour, and seeks in consequence to prove that equal quantities of labour have always the same value. On the other hand he has a presentiment, that labour, so far as it manifests itself in the value of commodities, counts only as expenditure of labour power, but he treats this expenditure as the mere sacrifice of rest, freedom, and happiness, not as at the same time the normal activity of living beings. But then, he has the modern wage-labourer in his eye.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#16\n\nWhat does it mean that Adam Smith confuses \"the determination of value by means of the quantity of labour expended in the production of commodities, with the determination of the values of commodities by means of the value of labour\"?\n\nDoes this mean that Adam Smith confuses the value of labour with the value of labour-power? Does this mean that he does not consider the possibility that not all the labour is equally useful? Is it because labour as a measure of value is not something ahistorical, in the sense that this is only true about the production of commodities?\n\nI'm really not understanding the difference between the two things Marx said. I know its supposedly \"just a note,\" but I've seen people warning to the importance of Marx's quotes so I'm trying to pay attention to them.",

In particular, [I have shown] how he sometimes confuses, and at other times substitutes, the determination of the value of *commodities* by the quantity of labour required for their production, with its determination by the quantity of living labour with which commodities can be bought, or, what is the same thing, the quantity of commodities with which a definite quantity of living labour can be bought. Here he makes the *exchange-value* of labour the measure for the value of commodities. In fact, he makes *wages* the measure; for wages are equal to the quantity of commodities bought with a definite quantity of living labour, or to the quantity of labour that can be bought by a definite quantity of commodities. The value of labour, or rather of labour-power, changes, like that of any other commodity, and is in no way specifically different from the value of other commodities. Here value is made the measuring rod and the basis for the explanation of value\u2014so we have a vicious circle.\n\n\n>...\n\n\n>But as Adam Smith quite correctly takes as his starting-point the commodity and the exchange of commodities, and thus the producers initially confront each other only as possessors of commodities, sellers of commodities and buyers of commodities, he therefore discovers (so it seems to him) that in the exchange between capital and wage-labour, ||246| materialised labour and living labour, the general law at once ceases to apply, and commodities (for labour too is a commodity in so far as it is bought and sold) do not exchange in proportion to the quantities of labour which they represent. Hence he concludes that labour-time is no longer the immanent measure which regulates the exchange-value of commodities, from the moment when the conditions of labour confront the wage-labourer in the form of landed property and capital. He should on the contrary, as Ricardo rightly points out, have drawn the opposite conclusion, that the expressions \u201cquantity of labour\u201d and \u201cvalue of labour\u201d are now no longer identical, and that therefore the relative value of commodities, although determined by the labour-time contained in them, is not determined by the value of labour, since that was only correct so long as the latter expression remained identical with the former. Later on, when we deal with Malthus, we can show how wrong and absurd it would be, even when the labourer appropriated his own product, i.e., the value of his own product, to make this value or the value of labour the measure of value, in the same sense in which labour-time or labour itself is the measure of value and the value-creating element. For even in that case the labour which can be bought with a commodity cannot serve as a measure in the same sense as the labour contained in it. One would be merely an index to the other.\n\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/ch03.htm",

As Anikin puts it in *A Science in Its Youth* (which is a great introduction to the history of political economy),\n\n\n>As Engels wrote, in Smith we find \u201cnot only two but even three, and strictly speaking even four sharply contrary opinions on value, running quite jollily side by side and intermingled\u201d. Evidently the main cause for this is that Smith could not find sufficiently logical links between the labour theory of value as it was developed at that time and recorded by him, and the complex concrete processes of capitalist economy. He therefore began to modify and adapt his initial conception.\n\n\n>Firstly, alongside value, which is determined by the quantity of necessary labour contained in a commodity (first and main view), he introduced a second concept in which value is determined by the quantity of labour which can purchase the given commodity. In a simple commodity economy, where there is no hired labour and commodity producers are working with means of production which belong to them, this is one and the same in terms of magnitude. A weaver, for example, exchanges a piece of cloth for a pair of boots. One might say that the piece of cloth is worth a pair of boots, or that it is worth the labour of the bootmaker for the time it took him to make the boots. But quantitative coincidence is not proof of identity, for the value of a given commodity may be quantitatively determined in one way only \u2014 in the known quantity of the other commodity.\n\n\n>Smith completely lost the ground under his feet when he tried to apply this, his second interpretation of value to capitalist production. If a bootmaker works for a capitalist, the value of the boots made by him and the \u201cvalue of his labour\u201d, that which he receives for his labour, are entirely different things. This means that the employer who buys the worker\u2019s labour (he is in fact buying labour power, the ability to labour, as Marx proved) receives more value than he pays for this labour.\n\n\n>Smith could not explain this phenomenon from the standpoint of the labour theory of value and wrongly concluded that value was determined by labour only in the \u201crude state of society\u201d, where there were no capitalists or hired workers, i.e., to use Marxist terminology, in a simple commodi ty economy. For the conditions of capitalism Smith constructed a third version of the theory of value: he decided that the value of a commodity was simply composed of costs, including workers\u2019 wages and the capitalist\u2019s profit (land rent as well in certain branches). He was also reassured by the fact that this theory of value seemed to explain the phenomenon of average profit on capital, \u201cnatural rates of... profit\u201d, as he put it. Smith simply equated value with the price of production, not seeing the complicated intermediate links between them.\n\n\n>This was \u201ctheory of prices set by production costs\u201d which was to play an important role in the following century. Here Smith adopted the practical standpoint of the capitalist who thinks that the price of his commodity is determined mainly by costs and average profit, and also by supply and demand at any given moment. This concept of value offered great scope for depicting labour, capital and landed property as equivalent creators of value. Say and other economists who sought to use political economy to defend the interests of capitalists and landowners, soon deduced this from Smith.\n\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/ascienceinitsyouth/page/207/mode/1up\n\n\nIn *A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy*, Marx says\n\n\n>Although Adam Smith determines the value of commodities by the labour-time contained in them, he then nevertheless transfers this determination of value in actual fact to pre-Smithian times. In other words, what he regards as true when considering simple commodities becomes confused as soon as he examines the higher and more complex forms of capital, wage-labour, rent, etc. He expresses this in the following way: the value of commodities was measured by labour-time in the paradise lost of the bourgeoisie, where people did not confront one another as capitalists, wage-labourers, landowners, tenant farmers, usurers, and so on, but simply as persons who produced commodities and exchanged them.\n\n\n[I think my comment is too long to post, so I'm going to make the rest a second comment.]",

He senses that somehow\u2014whatever the cause may be, and he does not grasp what it is\u2014in the actual result the law is suspended: more labour is exchanged for less labour (from the labourer\u2019s standpoint), less labour is exchanged for more labour (from the capitalist\u2019s standpoint). His merit is that he emphasises\u2014and it obviously perplexes him\u2014that with the accumulation of capital and the appearance of property in land\u2014that is, when the conditions of labour assume an independent existence over against labour itself\u2014something new occurs, apparently (and actually, in the result) the law of value changes into its opposite. It is his theoretical strength that he feels and stresses this contradiction, just as it is his theoretical weakness that the contradiction shakes his confidence in the general law, even for simple commodity exchange; that he does not perceive how this contradiction arises, through labour-power itself becoming a commodity, and that in the case of this specific commodity its use-value\u2014which therefore has nothing to do with its exchange-value\u2014is precisely the energy which creates exchange-value. Ricardo is ahead of Adam Smith in that these apparent contradictions\u2014in their result real contradictions\u2014do not confuse him. But he is behind Adam Smith in that he does not even suspect that this presents a problem, and therefore the specific development which the law of value undergoes with the formation of capital does not for a moment puzzle him or even attract his attention.

They were productive contradictions because Smith was at the cutting edge of science.\n\n\n>So labour that does not produce a use value is \"useless\" (these are probably not the correct terms to say this).\n\n\nThe terms are correct. This is just what Marx says:\n\n\n>If the thing is useless, so is the labour contained in it; the labour does not count as labour, and therefore creates no value.\n\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm\n\n\nI understand what you meant now though. The aspect of social necessity is not really relevant to the point Marx was making.",

I was wondering if anyone has an experience with something similar? I just feel like Im getting replies and am for some reason unable to see them. and its not all the time, I do get responses that I see and reply to. But it just seems like there are others that are just invisible to me. but maybe Im wrong.",
