    "selftext": "Hello Comrades. \n\nI'm struggling with finding objective books about the Soviet Union, especially about its achievements. Most of what I read is, unsurprisingly, from western historians holding an obvious bias towards socialism and, by extension, the USSR. \n\nI need books that help me show the achievements of the union!  \n\nI remember there was (maybe it still is) a huge collection of books in [archive.org](http://archive.org), but I forgot the name, I don't have the adress and I can't find it!\n\nAnyways, any book recommendation focused on this are appreciated!\n\nGood books I've already read include 'Is the Red Flag Flying?' and 'Human Rights in the USSR' both by Albert Szymanski.",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Arch Getty: he mostly uses western lib\u00e9ral sources and there are a few problems with his books, but he's the most honest one out there and I've seen him recommended a few times.\n\nDomenico Losurdo: I HIGHLY recommend literally anything written by this guy, it's that good, especially his book on Stalin, but all of them are great. Start with this one.\n\nGrover Furr: never read the guy, but have heard good things about him.. just a warning, some weird anti-\"stalinists\" (stalinism doesn't exist) says he is a Stalin \"apologetic\" and other western authors will say his works don't have scientific validity. That's a lie, I'm a historian and his works are all well sourced and written up to code with what we have best in academia.\n\nThe Restoration of Capitalism in the Soviet Union by W. B. Bland: never read it, but it was recommended to me by someone I highly trust inside my party, therefore I assume it's a safe read.\n\nSocialism Betrayed: Behind the Collapse of the Soviet Union by Roger Keeran & Thomas Kenny: highly recommend this one as well, the writing is phenomenal and it takes a look at different points so you'll have an overview.\n\nBesides those, I suggest you take a look at declassified CIA documents, some of them include data that prove the average soviet citizen had a better life than the average American, that is... better nutrition for example, etc",
