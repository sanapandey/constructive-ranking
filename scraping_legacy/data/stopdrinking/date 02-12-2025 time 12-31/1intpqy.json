(Not sure how many of you will get this reference lol)\n\nI know this isn't a huge milestone, but for some reason for me it is.  I've had so many day 1's where I'll make it a month and a few days without alcohol and then always convince myself around the 35-38 day mark that I'm good to \"moderate\"  which never stays that way for long.",
