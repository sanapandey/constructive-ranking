Community helped me a lot, coming here, sobriety group meetings (lots of options in person and online these days), reading this naked mind, also creating some accountability by telling friends and family I wasn't going to drink anymore all helped me quit.",

From what you\u2019ve put here unfortunately it sounds like we\u2019re the same type of drinker- blackouts, loss of control, devastating consequences. I\u2019m about to be 27 and if I could tell 23 yo me anything it would be STOP!!! It can and will get worse \ud83d\ude13 the temporary dopamine isn\u2019t worth the weeks/months/years of regret. Now is your chance to take your life back and build yourself into the best version you can be! Good luck and IWNDWYT",

You can also explore getting a sponsor which is a man that has some sobriety under his belt. Also accepting that you\u2019ll never be able to drink normally without bad things happening. My rehab told me to play the movie forward of what would have happen that day if you did drink. Usually the fear of doing something bad is enough to get past the craving. Good luck and hang in there.",
