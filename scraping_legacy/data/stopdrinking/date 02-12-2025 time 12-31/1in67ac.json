She is a daily beer drinker and we used to get drunk together a lot I was more of a binge drinker when we hungout a lot and I'd say 1-3 times every 2 weeks I would overconsume, I took a long break from her and recently I've tried to do non party stuff with her like that day and she did that the following evening. \n\nMakes me think she's doing it to tempt me and honestly it worked I had a drink, poured out the rest the vodka when she left though. I realize I dont have a friend I have a drinking friend.",

            "body": "It's possible she is just a drinking friend. But it's also possible she just doesn't understand. My friend didn't take me seriously when I said I quit drinking. To be fair, she had never seen me NOT drink and I had never voiced to her how much alcohol was impacting my life negatively. I didn't tell her about my alcohol related health issues and my pitiful mental state. So yes, she still offered me a drink every time we got together because that's just what we always did! It took a good few MONTHS of getting together and seeing me refusing alcohol before she finally got it through her head that I was serious. You should give your friend the benefit of the doubt. It's highly possible she just hasn't grasped that you are trying to make a change in your life. It might also be beneficial to see this friend less often if you think she will tempt you. Myself, I'm very stubborn. Every time I'm offered alcohol and get to say \"No thanks!\", it makes me feel empowered. lol But not everyone feels this way. Please make sure you put yourself and your sobriety first. Sometimes you might have to be a little rude about it, and that's okay!",

Even if I had been open about my issue, she has literally NEVER SEEN ME NOT DRINK. It must have been weird for her! I completely understand her not taking me seriously at first. lol",

I am done with beer\" and a bunch of others might even chime in and say \"yeah me too\". Or some people I know say they \"quit drinking\" but what they mean is that they stopped drinking vodka, they still drink beer.

Then she thought, no I don\u2019t have a problem, therefore you don\u2019t have a problem. And then she brought you alcohol to prove that fact to herself, by showing both herself (and by proxy) that your drinking is fine, therefore her drinking is fine as well. \n\nGiving her the most grace possible, she probably wasn\u2019t even consciously aware she was thinking this or putting you in such an uncomfortable position. She was just trying to protect her self image of herself and her drinking. Which yes, is a dick move, but likely an unintentional dick move. \n\nIf she is a true friend and a good friend, I would give another run and really explaining to her how alcohol has affected your life and how you feel alcohol is not serving you life (right now, forever, whatever you have decided) and that her gesture \u201cwhile thoughtful\u201d, made you uncomfortable. You are not judging her and you\u2019d like to continue a relationship with her, but you have boundaries around *your own* drinking and you\u2019d like her to respect that. If you don\u2019t think she\u2019s a true friend, that\u2019s also fine, we do have friends who are just drinking friends, and when the alcohol is removed there\u2019s nothing left (alcohol is a HUGE part of our society and adult friendships). That\u2019s up for you decide and act upon, while maintaining the boundaries you\u2019ve set for yourself. \n\nWhen I told my close friends I was stepping back from drinking, none of them offered me alcohol, but they did feel a little weird inviting me to events with alcohol, and I had to let them know it\u2019s ok, I have my own boundaries and if I need to leave I\u2019ll leave. I have less close friends I haven\u2019t seen in time since I really questioned and changed my relationship with alcohol, I never told them I wasn\u2019t drinking, I just declined heavy drinking invitations and they stopped inviting me out.",

Never realizing that my brain was so transfixed on drinking that not drinking didn't make sense. The main reason I went to AA (as a self-proclaimed atheist) was just to surround myself with non-drinkers. And when I told people that I quit, my drinking buddies got upset and tried to find a way to change my decisions, while real friends stood by my side saying \"yea it's probably the right thing to do...\" Drinking buddies faded into thin air, real friends (who still drink) are still there. But I've learned that I cannot be upset at people who worship alcohol, this addiction is ruthless, and it manifests itself in so many normalized ways. Not drinking simply allows be to see pass all the bullshit. It also allows me to do things that I actually enjoy doing, and not do things that are awful unless substances are involved. \n\nIWNDWYT",
