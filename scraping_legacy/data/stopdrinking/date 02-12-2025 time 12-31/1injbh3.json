    "selftext": "Ever since the new year my goal was to work on my habits. So each week I do a new habit and challenge and stack them and now it\u2019s getting pretty difficult to manage. Dec 31st 2024 I stop drinking, next week, stopped sleeping with my phone, the next week started going to the gym at 5:00 am Monday-thursday, the next week deleted social media, the next week stopped vaping, the next week started eating healthy, and now the next week I\u2019m going to get my budget under control. I know some may think this is too much all at once and I think it\u2019s starting to catch up to me. But today out of any other day was the day I wanted to drink and smoke so bad and I have had all the opportunity to do so but I still didn\u2019t, so in away I feel like it has been helping with willpower and displine in away. Anyways I don\u2019t really know why I\u2019m here maybe just wanted to talk hahaha but I haven\u2019t started feeling better, being healthy is boring and always doing the right thing. I still will do the things that I\u2019ve said I\u2019m committed and keep stacking them but it\u2019s really really hard and I\u2019m struggling. ",

Oddly enough I have been craving uppers but know that\u2019s not a road to go down. Hard to be content being sober at times. Craving that dopamine rush :/",

All of my other goals are great, but if I have a little too much ice cream that's okay too. I don't need to be perfect in all things all the time, just not drinking today.",

There are some character defaults that were always with me, even before I started drinking. Now that the alcohol is gone, they haven't magically disappeared and I'm forced to recognize them. Not a comfortable feeling. \n\nThe obvious answer would be to get rid of those character defects but some of those take a long time to unlearn. In the meantime, I try to remember where I used to be and where I'm at now. It's a huge 180 and it can easily be undone with one drink. That's why it's imperative that I don't do anything to jeopardize it as well, yet I should also be very proud that I'm here. I try not to overdo too much and be realistic with my expectations. This helps me to not completely break down and stress because that was a trigger in the past. \n\nIt doesn't matter if it's a centimeter or a kilometer, as long as you are moving forward, you are going in the right direction. It's progress, not perfection. \n\nIWNDWYT",

Not only NOT doing things (drinking, vaping, social media) but also DOING new things (eating healthy, gym, doing budget stuff).  \n\n  \nLike everyone has already said, I'd focus on the most important one(s) - not drinking and not smoking would be my pick. But also, what are you doing to reward or soothe yourself - what does your downtime look like?\n\n  \nIf I were you, I'd build in a whole lot of reward time that you get to do every day.   For me those would involve food - you might have to not worry about eating healthy for right now.  And your budget might not be in super great shape for a while.\n\n  \nBut listen, you can get there.  Your goal is simply to live like a squared-away person.   At first it feels like a performance - as you say, being healthy is boring.  That's because you haven't made the transition yet to finding this a normal way to live.

That\u2019s massive and awesome. Congratulations! You have given me inspiration with your planning, action, and resolve.\n\nWhile as others said, you\u2019re doing it quickly, I\u2019ll also say\u2026 you do you. I think the intensity in which you are tackling is what works for some people. You\u2019re stacking the habits, and they will build on each other. Give time for everything to start clicking and paying off. I\u2019ve been in a slump too waiting for all the greatness and epiphanies of sobriety and am finding it a bit boring. But it\u2019s a process. Life didn\u2019t suck right when I started drinking. It won\u2019t get better immediately after stopping. It\u2019s the long arc of consequences, and you have chosen a different trajectory. Hang in there and keep going. The endorphins from working out will kick in. That will start to feel better than what the other habits gave you. And then good results from budgeting will start to pay off, etc.\n\nIF it ends up being more than you can do every day, give yourself a break. And most importantly, keep any slips or missed targets un-stacked from each other. So if you have a bad day of eating or don\u2019t go to the gym, don\u2019t let it erode other gains you\u2019ve made in other areas. Keep your foundation solid and that is that you don\u2019t drink. \n\nI will not drink with you today. But I will go to the gym tomorrow with you (at least virtually)! Seriously, great job on taking steps to get your life together. It is really inspirational.",
