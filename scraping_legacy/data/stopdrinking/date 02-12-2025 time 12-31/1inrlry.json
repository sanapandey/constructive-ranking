I\u2019m 29F and I\u2019ve just had enough, I feel like I drink out of pure habit at this rate and it\u2019s a habit I can\u2019t seem to break, my longest attempt was 18 days without a drink in the summer of last year, it\u2019s so bad I am even considering hypnotism. I can\u2019t keep waking up and worrying I\u2019m going to turn yellow, my health anxiety is debilitating me and it\u2019s all caused from drinking!\n\nI wish I understood why I keep doing this to myself, here\u2019s to day 1 for the hundredth time, I hope this time around I can catch up with a few of you peeps.",
