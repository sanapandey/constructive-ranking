    "selftext": "First ten days weren\u2019t as bad as I was expecting. I think being busy with work and finding a new game to dump 30 hours in over that time helped quite a bit. But the game is getting old, work is slowing down, and, well, frankly I\u2019m trying to do a college paper and getting riddled with anxiety trying to start the damn thing. Normally I would just have a few drinks before starting, the booze easing the anxiety, then make a few quick edits the next day and submit. \n\nAnyway today isn\u2019t going to be the day I break but it\u2019s been the hardest so far.

Describe it.\n\nEarly sobriety was filled with all sorts of emotional swings, twitches, cravings, etc.  What helped me with the cravings was Lil Debbie snack cakes and coffee. What helped with isolation was getting to a support group or calling a friend. As for the physical and emotional healing, that just took some time. But it got better one day at a time.\n\nAs for boredom, for me it's just a mental loop that comes with a feeling of restlessness. Keeping busy with things that require focus usually puts that loop to rest. Drawing, writing, making music, cleaning the house, working in the yard, doing complex puzzles, resistance training, and gardening are just a few of my pursuits that put the mental loops to rest.\n\nI wish you well.",

It probably peaked in the second month when I realized the extent of the vacuum left behind by alcohol.\n\n\nThe first month I enjoyed the huge drop in anxiety and was kept busy getting all the traces of drinking out of my house. It also took time to figure out who I could count on for support. I went to my first AA meeting on day 28.\u00a0\n\n\nBy month three my sleeping was improving and my motivation was coming back. The boredom started to disappear and I grew used to a different daily routine.\u00a0\n\n\nIt takes time OP to learn how to live sober.\u00a0",

If you can do it drunk it ought to be easy sober.  And those few quick edits? not so much when you read the assignment wrong or were more interested in a different topic....",
