    "selftext": "Haven't had a night off in a couple of months now.\n\nJust after 7pm here - prime danger zone for me.\n\nBut instead of being on my second beer (of 8), I'm about 30 mins in to 4 mile walk.\n\nI've left my car at one end, and have to get public transport back, so am committed to this walk. Gonna treat myself to a burger when I finally get back to my car, so don't expect to be home til around 9. \n\nToo late to start drinking then (for me),  so it just took a little motivation to at least have one  night off.\n\nLooking forward to a read tonight, and some proper restful sleep. And of course no anxiety inducing hangover tomorrow.\n\nNot sure the point of this post, other than maybe offering some inspiration for anyone else struggling to break the cycle like I am.\n\nLate night showing at the cinema is another good one to get your mind off it.\n\nPeace to you all.\n\nEdit - thanks all for your comments.  Done it, had my burger, fries and strawberry shake.  In bed with my book now.  Funny once I got past the \"Danger zone\" I didn't feel the need to drink.\nWishing you all well.",

If you can find a gym with a lap pool swimming is a great relaxing exercise to clear the mind. And even if you aren't good at swimming, it's hard to think about drinking when you are trying to just breath. Congrats on the win. Enjoy the hell out of that burger",

Being in the water really takes you out of your usual space. Ugh! I miss summer. It always comes back, but yikes Feb is hard.",

Any time was right on time. \nI\u2019ve found that my alcoholic brain does not like a moving target so you taking a long walk is the best thing to do. Any movement really is beneficial for me so I try to stay in motion. And when I can\u2019t I come here and keep my brain in motion. \nIt helps to keep reminding me of the hell that awaits if I pick up",
