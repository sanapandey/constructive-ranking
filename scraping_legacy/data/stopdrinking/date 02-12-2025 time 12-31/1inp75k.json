    "selftext": "\"Stop drinking and start becoming the person you were meant to be!\" I wish I had been mentored on this idea at a younger age. But I grew up in a small town and almost everyone's parents drank. Alcohol was normalized everywhere, and even though my father was a violent drunk, I became an alcoholic too. But I escaped the grips of alcoholism almost 8 years ago! And now it's my honor and side-mission to mentor others on this idea of keeping alcohol out of one's life so that they can live up to their potential! For now, I don't have many avenues for doing this work, but this subreddit is helping me achieve that goal, one day at a time! It's a place to commit to a daily practice of reaching out to others and giving support! If you're here, you're in the right place! We can fight together! Quitting is achievable for everyone!",

That and telling that dumb inner voice it's not my boss.\n\n\nEyes on the prize. This is temporary, it really is.",

Not because of difficult emotions but usually because I was feeling better emotionally and the physical symptoms of binge drinking were clearing up so it was \u201csafe\u201d. Thinking about how my body is always in the worst pain ever for weeks after a binge finally got me past that hump. Those negative associations work for me for the quick cravings but aren\u2019t enough to abstain forever. Fortunately after two months I\u2019m starting to find other reasons to stay off the sauce that are just as powerful. Good luck you got this",

Hmm today I have more $$ bc I didn\u2019t waste it on something that makes me feel awful. I also forced myself into challenging activities bc my brain needed it so badly for the boredom. After a bad breakup I walked into a scuba shop and got certified as a woman at 37yo. I was terrified and intimidated as hell. But the community was so nice and most didn\u2019t even drink bc we have to get up at 5:30 to be at the boat early. Had to learn all the gear and safety checks and then the reward was seeing incredible marine life which humbled me to my core. That was the mental challenge that I realized I needed. I spent so much wasted time in my place isolating and it drove me to drink over and over again. Instead now I\u2019m able to see some nature that\u2019s just so beautiful which I never would have been able to hungover.",

Isolation is really difficult, but there are real people here, sharing and talking, and I know that's not the same as in-person, but it's a start to growing communication skills. I mean, it's really strong of you to share what you just shared! I think talking about these hard things helps us figure out ways to change them. If you are feeling alright, maybe it would be cool to look for a yoga class, or some fitness class. They can be a safe place to be around people. People that are there with similar interests and they know the power of community so they have come together. There's many good people out there, my friend. If you keep this healthier path, I can guarantee you will connect with others and find your people!",

I too grew up in a small town, where drinking was just what you did after work, on the weekends, when you stopped by someone\u2019s house to grab an egg, really anywhere. I know moms who\u2019ve flipped their cars with their kids inside who were back at the tavern the next day, bc it\u2019s a small town, so everyone knows the cops too. I had situations where I needed my parents, but they were dead asleep drunk and couldn\u2019t answer the phone, and even if they did, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to drive anyway. That\u2019s not to say everyone in this town is like this, it\u2019s just the people my family surrounded themselves with. A lot of my friends parents drank very little or not at all. \n\nI\u2019m back at home pregnant, with my husband, while we search for our own home, and watching my mom especially solidifies that that\u2019s not the kind of parent I want to be. I toyed with not drinking for a year on and off before getting pregnant, and those first few weeks were rough, I was sooo miserable, but I didn\u2019t drink. I don\u2019t think I am an alcoholic in the way that I need it to live, it was just such a habit for me that I didn\u2019t know how to live, especially in social situations, without it. Now I feel great, and I know I don\u2019t have that many days under my belt, and I\u2019m likely in the pink cloud but I almost feel lucky that I have a hard and fast reason not to. My best friend is pregnant alongside me, and I know she\u2019s been sneaking \u201csips\u201d, it makes me sad for her and her child, but I can only control what goes on with me. I came back to this sub for posts like these, to see what milestones people have achieved by their own will, so I can be reminded and reinforced when this baby arrives and I don\u2019t have a hard reason to not, other than how much easier life is without a hangover, or that little bug waiting for the next drink. Plus seeing how much money I\u2019ve saved is a nice bonus, what a world where I\u2019m not seeing double digits at best the week before I\u2019m paid again. Sorry for the novel, iwndwyt.",
