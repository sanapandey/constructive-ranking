    "selftext": "so I'm in my 3rd week sober now, and this is where the negative feeling of past drinking is fading a bit and when that drinking voice starts creeping in again. Yesterday was the first time when it got really loud again and made me think about getting booze and today it's still there. There's nothing that I want more for myself than long term sobriety, and I know that drinking will only give me misery, but that voice will still come and go. \n\nAnyway I'm not giving into that voice and when I get close to doing so I'll play the tape forward. It's still something that I'll have to deal with, and in the past when that negative feeling of past drinking fades is often when I have relapsed, so just wanted to write this out here.\n\nIWNDWYT!",

There\u2019s probably some good online info to look up that\u2019ll help train your brain to resist the voice. One thing that helped me is knowing that if you give it space to debate with you, it\u2019ll always win. If you firmly tell it \u201cno, end of discussion\u201d, it does quiet more quickly.",

It's so much easier being a part of a group of like-minded people who all just want to support each other in our sobriety.  It's nice having a place to go and people to call where I I'm understood and will help me through those times when the voices get bad",

If I had cravings, I'd eat some wondrous Lil Debbie snack cakes and get myself to a meeting of my support group. Or call a close friend who knew that I was trying to create sobriety. I didn't do it alone. There were no online groups that I was aware of when I started creating sobriety (1996), so I did in-person stuff. \n\nJust the act of getting in my car driving to a meeting helped immensely (eating a Swiss roll on the way). I didn't agree with everything said or believed at these meetings, but they didn't require me to do so in order to belong. Just being with other drunks who were trying to create sobriety was great help.\n\nJust today, I'll do whatever it takes to create a sober day. The days add up. I wish you well. :)",

Just that every 2-4 weeks or so I relapse for about a day or for one night and then get back to being sober. Haven't been drinking daily anymore for a good while now, but want to cut out the relapses completely.",

I recognize I have an itch, I know it will pass without scratching if I just let it, and it does.\n\nIWNDWYT",
