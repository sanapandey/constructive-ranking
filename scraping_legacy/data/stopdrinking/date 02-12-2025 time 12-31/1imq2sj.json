    "selftext": "Hello, fellow Sobernauts!\n\nWelcome to 'Tude Talk Tuesday, where you're invited to share what changes you've noticed in your attitudes and perspectives since you've gotten sober.\n\nI once heard someone say \"the opposite of addiction is connection\" and that resonated with me.\n\nAs my drinking progressed, did my best to cut myself off from the world.  I canceled plans with friends.  I avoided talking with coworkers.  I just wanted to shut myself away and drink in peace.\n\nIn sobriety, I have begrudgingly made connections with others.  I'm an introvert by nature and socially anxious and have long held the belief that I just really don't like or need to interact with other people.\n\nI'm wrong.  I hate the phone.  I hate talking to people on the phone.  Today, I forced myself to call three people instead of emailing or texting them.  After every single conversation, I felt much better.  I was downright giddy actually.  I learned things about people.  I got a chance to be nice and spread some positivity.  I had a much better day than had I kept to myself.\n\nI don't want it to be true, but it is, at least for me.  Connection takes me light years away from where I was in my addiction.\n\nSo, how about you?  Does connection help with your addiction?",

Just a couple days into my sober journey, I struck up a conversation with someone who is sticking around for a couple of months before heading back home. It was so strange, but I knew he was sober even though neither of us said a word about sobriety (later confirmed via text). He\u2019s been checking in on me everyday to make sure I\u2019m doing good. I also found out my very close friend has been sober for 6 weeks but she hadn\u2019t told me. \n\nIt felt like once I dropped the booze and said to the universe \u201cthis is the new me\u201d, it started to send kindred people my way. So yes, connection is helping, and in very unexpected and amazing ways.",

            "body": "Connection most definitely helps with my addiction. I'm in AA and also an atheist so I can have a rough go of all the spiritual awakening talk if it's related to religion or god. To me, focusing on growing my spirituality means focusing on connecting with others and acknowledging how much I need others to achieve my goals and be happy in life. Alcohol made me feel big and like I was the center of the universe - much of my spiritual work now is realizing how small I am in the grand scheme of things. Remaining teachable, asking myself \"this person is a teacher, what can I learn from them?\" when I'm talking to someone - especially if I'd rather be the one talking haha! I will not drink with you all today!",

            "body": "I'm learning that connection is an important part of recovery. It kinda sucks, like, wanting to do it all yourself and not to get anyone else involved for fear of relapse or disappointing them. However, for me, sobriety is a HUGE life change (esp financially - I bartended for four years), and choosing not to ask for help or pretending like I don't need anyone to support me is a lie I told myself to stay addicted. I don't have a giant circle of support, and that's okay with me because the people that I chose to be in my circle support me all the way. I wish I could do it alone, but I'm so grateful that I can't. Connecting with others and being vulnerable has allowed me to recognize my own commitment to myself. Also, support groups like r/stopdrinking have played a large role in my recovery, and even though we're all connected through the massively oversaturated internet, I've found significant value in sharing my lived experience, and reading how others have overcome their addiction. \n\nI'm just glad to have people to share this experience with <3",

Winter weather in the past was always a great reason to drink (what wasn't right?)\n\nhave been feeling a little bla the last couple of weeks without a lot of highs and not a lot of lows, just very low key.  Hoping when the weather breaks and the sun comes out things will look up.  Thankfully, I haven't craved a drink yet, just feel like sometimes when i was drinking i could be more fun to be around, at least that was my perspective lol.",
