    "selftext": "I've scheduled a ten-day vacation after a big work milestone where I'm going to be traveling on my own. This is lots of red flags for me: no one around whom I'm accountable to, an atmosphere that's promoting drinking heavily, and a big accomplishment that I feel like I deserve a \"reward\" for. My biggest binges have been in exactly this kind of situation--a solo work trip--and I have strong associations between traveling alone and drinking.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to mentally prepare? I've been ruminating over this situation for the past week and it bugs me that I'm finding myself envisioning picking up bottles of wine and taking them back to my hotel. It's also the first time since I stopped drinking a few months ago that I'll be shaking up my current routine, which has been working really well.\n\nThanks for your thoughts & support!",

The only reason I can think of is they wanted someone to know to help keep them accountable. If you\u2019re checking into a hotel, you could casually drop a line to the front desk person like \u201cI\u2019m so excited to be enjoying a sober vacation.\u201d And maybe ask for recommendations on places to eat that aren\u2019t booze centered (food trucks, etc.).",

Sounds like a well deserved vacation no matter what. \n\nWhat i have generally done is to ask myself if the 'at risk' events are worth it.. most of the time I just recuse myself altogether. \n\nBut alas we still have life to live and experiences to have.. can't just stop all travel / interactions with the world.\n\nIf plans are locked in and it's just a solo endeavor.. you could try to bring a notebook and daily / actively state your intentions for the day.. maybe make a contract for yourself in the morning & then close it out with a confirmation at night.. might seem silly or cliche but it helped me out in similar situations.",

Where did it all go while I was focused on creating something? And if all that ceased to exist while I was focused, does it really have any concrete reality at all?\n\nI can practice bringing my attention back to the present or to today, but sometimes it just becomes a fight with a mental loop I'm playing over and over. I'm actually reinforcing the loop. I find that keeping busy focusing on activities that require focus, and parts of the brain other than the looping part, are what has helped me to be in today the best.\n\nHere I am. It's today. Which me? Which world? My actions will create the day for the most part. If my actions don't include drinking the first drink, then at the very least, I will be sober today.\n\nIf today, I find myself really wanting to drink, I'll get to a meeting or call an understanding friend right away. Or even get to this sub and write some posts and communicate.\n\nIt does get easier. If I'm some place where others are drinking, I drink my coffee or flavored seltzer and never think about drinking really. It's very rare that anyone cares about what I'm drinking, or why I'm not drinking booze. If they are concerned, I just say, \"I don't drink.\" If they want to pursue why, I'm more than willing to tell them I'm an alcoholic and the story of it.\n\nI wish you well. Make a good today. When tomorrow comes, do the same. :)",
