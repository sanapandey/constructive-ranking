Your brain was used to alcohol suppressing everything, so now there's no alcohol it's on overdrive, like after your foot goes to sleep, all those tingles when it wakes up? Your brain is doing that with your feelings.   It doesn't no how to control them or feel them because it hasn't had to in a long time.   \n\nTalk to you doctor about it.  My doctor put me on abilify to deal with the mood swings in my early recovery, gabapentin is useful too according to the Veterans Administration.    \nI also take the supplement GABA (chemical that controls your emotions) as alcohol kills GABA production in your brain. Magnesium helps restore your brain chemicals, too, and will help with sleep.\n\nBut mostly it just takes time.",

I use this for my own anxiety or episodes of what the hell is happening moments. \n\nYou are 16 days into this journey, you are a bad ass. Give yourself some credit as this is hard to do. If you can grab some chocolate, something sweet, alcohol has so much sugar in it that our body craves it. You quit drinking and your body is craving the sugar we used to drown it in. Feel the temptation come on grab a piece of chocolate, keep your hands busy. \n\nRemember this is just a bad moment not a bad life and you can do this. You are stronger than your addiction.

You will have a lots of ups and downs, don't get me wrong, but as you get used to it and your brain gets used to not feeding on alcohol, you will find a stability you didn't even imagine before you realise it!\n\nIWNDWYT",

            "body": "You need to be proud. Im in an early stage of sobriety too and I understand what you are feeling. \n\nFor 20 years, when I was drinking, I never understood, processed or faced my emotions. And I started at the early age of 14 and it was my coping mechanism throughout all of my adult life. There are times I don't even remember how I was feeling, such as my divorce, death of close one, domestic violence. The alcohol numbed it out and my brain cut these emotions off. \n\nNow that we no longer have this \"numbing agent\", it is normal to feel these ways. We are learning to face ourselves and our emotions. Be gentle to yourself. It will definitely get better. There are days where you will feel really sad or angry. Monitor this over the coming weeks and acknowledge your feelings even if you cannot face it yet. Understand that the journey will come with its challenges which will lead to wonderful results. If you still feel overwhelmed, sad or depressed in coming weeks, consider talking about it with someone you trust or with a therapist. \n\nAlso, if you can try, in the coming days, to do things that make you feel good, that will also help. Treat yourself a bit (It can be by sleeping in or by eating something you love, it does not have to be something huge). Alcohol tends to increase our happiness hormones on a temporary/short term basis (but very detrimental on a long term basis). When you remove the alcohol, you need to find some ways for your body to produce/replace that level of dopamine (Reduce stress, eating well, sleeping well, doing activities, watching a show you love, having a walk, listening to music). \n\nSince I had sleeping and eating issues, these were my quick wins and now I am incorporating other things like watching new shows, listening to a new playlist, trying to do something new during the week end- gardening and drawing. I have not yet reached that mental energy to try something very active like sports, I like being active but not when it feels forced or so challenging that it makes me hate it (But sports does help in getting the dopamine- if its your thing, try it!!!). I will soon try dancing as it feels like a good compromise to remain active while doing something I like. \n\nWe will not able to have the answers for everything yet. Its a lot of things happening in our mind and body altogether and a lot to even process. One thing I have learnt in therapy is to let our mind give us the answer. For e.g, if there is something bothering you, lets say your work mate being a pain. Ask yourself or write down a question or a short thought about it and put it aside. Your mind will work in the background to give you the answer and you will definitely know when it happens. You don't need to always dwell on everything happening, just give time to your brain to process it. \n\nBe gentle to yourself, sometimes a little selfish (Not in a hurtful way; just in a way to have your mental peace at the heart of everything you do).\n\nBe proud of the little steps. It is not a competition and no one's journey is the same. I know my answer seems a little cliche. I thought so too when I first started therapy and my therapist recommended I improve my sleep, eating and daily routines. I was asking myself how are these going to help. But since it couldn't do any harm to try and were quite low efforts, I did take the baby steps and I can say it does work. I am not in my happiest place, but I am in a place where I feel free, strong and where I love myself better.\n\nI know a lot of articles on the net tend to make it seems that it is so easy that we feel like we are failing our fight or not doing it right. Its the same media that portrays a woman with a flat stomach 2 minutes after giving birth. We do not have to compare, its our journey, its a battle within ourselves that only us know how to fight. \n\nHope to hear more of you. \n\nYou are doing great!!!",
