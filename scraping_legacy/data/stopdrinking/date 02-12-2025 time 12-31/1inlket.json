    "selftext": "*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*\n\n**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**\n\nI'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.\n\nMaybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!\n\n---\n\n**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!\n\nWhat happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.\n\n**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.\n\n**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.\n\n---\n\nThis post goes up at:\n\n- US - Night/Early Morning\n- Europe - Morning\n- Asia and Australia - Evening/Night\n\nA link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar.\n\n---\n\nI just arrived in a city that is very very excited to have recently won a big sports game. I don\u2019t give a shit about that sport (or any sport, except maybe ice skating, on an Olympics-aligned cycle), so walking around the city feels like a visceral, visual tour of someone else\u2019s excitement. Like walking past a book written in a language I can\u2019t read. It\u2019s there, but it\u2019s not for me. \n\nThat detachment is how I want to be with drinking. Drinking alcohol is there, but not for me! The way I used to confidently ignore scams about \u201cyour car\u2019s warranty!\u201d bc I literally had never owned a car\u2026 that\u2019s that same distance that I have now after a year active here at the DCI that helps me walk past the liquor store or wine list or free drinks bc they are not on my radar, at all! \n\nThat detachment took a while to build up \u2014 and it\u2019s a muscle I have to exercise daily. I know I could falter at any moment so it\u2019s a balancing act, to feel confident enough in my sobriety that I am content sober, and not testing limits to make sure they still exist. Fuck, it\u2019s hard sometimes! But worth it. \n\nWhere are you at on that journey? IWNDWYT! \ud83e\udd85\ud83d\udd14\n\n",

But after overcoming intense cravings and being able to enjoy the immense pride I felt afterwards, I'm a little more confident. It started with my 3rd DJ, then I decided to extend to at least 50 days. Almost there ! But today I felt the need to set up a new goal, as my 50 days approach : no drinking until the end of March. March is gonna be absolutely crazy and stressful, at work and in my personal life (important medical checkups coming up). Sobriety gives me confidence that I'll get through all this. I just can't imagine dealing with that shit with alcohol in my life.\n\nBut March is also the month of my birthday, which I've never done sober. And the beginning of spring, which usually triggers me to drink. So it's gonna be a big test.\n\nTraining my detachment until then ! Everyday I try to acknowledge at least one positive thing that sobriety brings me.\n\nIWNDWYT \u2728",

Like no more \u201cwill i/won\u2019t I?\u201d With buying wine, it just wasn\u2019t an aisle that had anything for me on it anymore and that\u2019s a very liberating feeling. I realize this isn\u2019t something I can let slip though so still making my grocery lists and sticking to them to avoid even having the thought enter my mind.

Ah, I'm going to go out on limb and guess our host is in the town with the famous bell, LOL!\n\nI'm getting there regarding the detachment - I was at my doc's office yesterday and overheard a conversation about a cool new brewery that just opened up in in a nearby town.  Normally, I'd be making mental notes and plans to visit as soon as possible - beer doesn't do much for me, but good unique beer was always a great starting point for a good, solid drunken episode.  My immediate thought was, \"That's a shame\", as in the famous Seinfeld quote, I just didn't really care.  Now, it's easy to dismiss a brewery given my casual relationship with beer, harder had it been a distillery, but just overhearing didn't cause any triggers or sudden dopamine rushes.  I'm getting there.\n\nAs part of my doc visit (annual physical), we discussed my sober journey and at some point she said, \"You know that's great you've stopped drinking, but you don't sound very proud about it.\"  I thought about that for a moment and the only thing that occured to me was, well, it's something I'm doing one day at a time, so, yeah, I am proud of myself, but it's really today that counts. (I'm prouder of the fact I've lost over 20 lbs. and she's cutting back on my BP meds, LOL!)\n\nIWNDWYT!",

But with anything else, It honestly depends on the day for me. Wanting to drink, grief, happiness, joy, etc. It's all very \"in the moment\" for me. But I feel resolute in my choice not to drink. I've even told people \"I don't drink\" instead of \"I don't drink right now\" and I saw a fantastic bit on here that said they tell people \"oh, I can drink as much as I'd like. And the amount I want to drink is none\" absolutely fabulous and I'm absolutely gonna use it!\n\nHave a wonderful Wednesday, friends! IWNDWYT \u2764\ufe0f",

Those feelings aren\u2019t surprising at all considering I drank heavily for about 40 years and we are constantly bombarded with the message that alcohol enhances your quality of life. Commercials and advertisements, flowery descriptions of wines, beers and cocktails. When we are out and about, we see folks drinking and, until they turn sloppy, having an \u201cenhanced\u201d time. For me, there was a large amount of \u201cdeprogramming\u201d that needed to happen to get to my personal truth about alcohol. \n\nAt some point my view shifted. I know without a doubt that my life is better, richer, more satisfying and more genuine without alcohol. I won\u2019t go so far as to say it never adds anything to an experience. I still believe that the right wine can enhance a fine meal. But that\u2019s about the only circumstance that I can think of where alcohol has even a chance of being a positive for me. Every other instance of drinking I can think of was to alter my consciousness and distort reality. Sometimes only a little, sometimes a lot. The better solution for me is to work on making my reality something that is so cool I don\u2019t want to alter or get away from it. \n\nComing from that mindset I find it fairly easy to be sober around alcohol and friends and family that are drinking. I buy wine and vodka for my wife at the store all the time. I still hang out with my long time friends most of whom are heavy drinkers (if they get annoying and sloppy, I remove myself). We go out to eat regularly, etc. Trying to isolate myself from alcohol does not seem like a good strategy for me. It\u2019s everywhere and lots of the things I like to do (golf, fishing, socializing, etc.) are activities that society links with alcohol. I\u2019m not going to let alcohol take those enjoyments away from me. \n\nI know where I could end up if I resume drinking. So, I pass on that potentially positive glass of wine because that is the first step down a path I no longer wish to walk. Perhaps I could take that first step and then turn around and not go down that path. But, honestly, the up side of that glass of fine wine with that killer meal isn\u2019t SO AWESOME that I\u2019m willing to test that theory. I think instead I\u2019ll have a killer dessert, a glass of ice cold nonfat milk and wake up tomorrow feeling clear headed and ready to continue making my life as cool as I can make it. \n\nIWNDWYT!",

I was often waiting out some specific time period, so I'd quit for Lent and be counting down the days until I could have a drink, or I'd \"quit\" for a while, but be looking forward to a drink once I decided that I thought I was at the point where I could drink \"normally\" (Probably don't need to post a spoiler alert about how that always turned out). This time though, I hit rock bottom. Wound up in jail. Nearly lost my entire family, my wife, kids, my job, my home, everything that means anything to me. \n\nI woke up on Day 1 in jail, not knowing when I was going to get out, if I was ever going to see my kids again, if I had a place to live, and any cravings vanished. In the 2 - 3 months after that, I wasn't allowed to see or even speak to my family and was living by myself in seedy motels and short-term rentals in bad neighborhoods. Being so close to losing everything caused a switch to flip. Now, I have no problem at all being around people who are drinking, having alcohol in my house, or even going to the liquor store to buy something for guests or for my wife. I know that it's over for me, and even the thought of drinking makes me feel sick. I'm not counting down the days until I can have another drink, I'm racking up the days since I've had my last drink.\n\nI'm soooo glad that the switch flipped, though I really wish it could have happened much much sooner. Since getting past that, my life is better than it has ever been, and I'm looking forward to spending the rest of it alcohol free.\n\n  \nIWNDWYT",
