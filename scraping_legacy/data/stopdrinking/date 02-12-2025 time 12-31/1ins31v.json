I messed up for the final time on Sunday and if I get blacked out again, my wife is going to leave me.\n\nThis day 3 is the easiest it has ever been for me. Every time I say no to alcohol, I'm saying yes to my wife, and my hopes and dreams for a healthy body and a happy life.\n\nI've quit nicotine before and I hit a similar point on my last go around. You have to know and feel that you're done. I'm glad I am, I hope you are too. You have to want to stop and never look back. It'll always be a struggle but when you are purely and truly motivated, you'll know.",

That voice lies to me, saying things like \"You can have just one drink\" and \"You've definitely demonstrated that you have it all under control, you can moderate again\".\n\nI can't moderate and I won't moderate.  I know that now, I've done the experiment over and over.  I can't resist the second drink, but I can resist the first one.  That realization is a huge part of my success in my current run.  When that voice starts talking to me, I tell it to fuck off.\n\n2) Disgust at myself.  My last night drinking in 2019, my wife had been very sick with the flu.  High fever, sleeping all the time.  I used that opportunity to start drinking earlier in the evening and drink more.  I woke up one morning, hungover, and saw that I had watched multiple hours of HBO and had zero recollection of it.  I realized that had my wife's illness turned for the worse, I wouldn't have noticed.  I wouldn't have been able to take her to the ER.  I wouldn't have been able to take care of our 13 year old son.  I was disgusted at myself.  I resolved never to put my family in that position again.\n\nBest wishes, friend.  I will not drink with you today.",

What if I just have zero tolerance, no cheating, no trying to find ways around it, no failures or stumbles?\".\n\nIt was a very \"Do or do not, there is no try\" moment for me, and it all just clicked.  It was also bolstered by the fact that my withdrawals were hellish and almost killed me, and I know they would only be worse if I ever picked up drinking again even temporarily.\n\nSobriety is so simple and easy now.  Life is far from perfect (o how far), but I \\*have\\* a life.

But after 3 months, I didn't want to break my streak (it is easier to stay sober then get sober, for me) and just focused on that. \n\nAs I got closer to my goal I asked myself over and over whether I thought I kicked my bad habits and could return to alcohol without slipping into those patterns again. I never felt a confident yes. So, I continue to not drink. What I found is that after 6ish months of not drinking, the quietest peace took hold. It's something I would have never felt in the hamster wheel. \n\nGood work! I will not drink with you today.",

I knew I had to make changes in order for this to work. Slowly I put one foot in front of the other and moved forward. \n\nAt first, my goal was just to make it through the first several hours. Then, my goal was to make it out of the withdrawal phase, which was usually around three weeks to a month for me. I felt better physically, but there was still a big mental challenge as I would ruminate about all the troubles that I had caused from the years of drinking. I went to support groups to help with this and was active in the meetings. My first 9 months I was really consistent with this as well; something that I did not do from previous streaks. \n\nAs day by day went by, I started to see little changes with things, however, there were still setbacks with life. I stayed the course and the motivation of not returning back to where I was kept me going. I'm still going right now, yet it's definitely scary that I've gone this far. My longest sobriety streak was probably around 6 months, and that probably even included me taking a drink and lying to myself that it didn't count, so maybe 4-5 months was the real date. It frightens me reading the stories of people that relapse after years, because all their stories is me in the past or could be me in the future. \n\nI feel like I am the definition of chronic relapser, yet the silver lining is that if I can make it here to post this, it means anyone reading this also can do it as well. \n\nIWNDWYT",
