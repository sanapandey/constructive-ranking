    "selftext": "I had a major health scare end of last year with elevated cholesterol and very elevated liver numbers.  Drinking had gotten out of hand over the years since starting work from home - won\u2019t go into details but it was a lot ramping up over a decade.\n\nI did dry January and got back to the gym, and went for bloodwork the first of February hoping for some improvement but expecting some elevation.  Everything is normal again!  Just a reminder that even if you don\u2019t plan to quit forever, taking a long break and giving your organs rest is so helpful.",

Fast forward to 12 months later, I\u2019m 75 days sober had bloodwork 33 days into this stint of sobriety, everything is normal again. The liver is incredibly forgiving it doesn\u2019t forget.",
