I always wake up in the morning feeling awful and I vow to not drink again, only to wake up the next day and it's like my brain has completely forgotten how I felt the day before. I am a young professional (27F) and just starting out in my career and I feel alcohol is really starting to get in the way of my life. I'm worried about the impact it's having on my health as I've been drinking this way for years, I'm worried about irreversible damage. Any advice? Are there any books I can read about the brain and alcohol? Maybe understanding it would help me stop",

I call that part the 'evil clown', as Craig Beck calls it in his very helpful 'Happy Sober Podcast'. This podcast is meant for people like you. \n\nBooks in English that helped me not wanting to drink anymore:\n\nWilliam Porter: Alcohol explained\n\nAnnie Grace: This naked mind. She has an app with the same name too where you can subscribe to the free 'Alcohol Experiment' (30 days). That will change your ideas about alcohol. \n\nJust start reading and listening podcasts. In the long run you will find what you're looking for: freedom and self respect. Good luck dear friend.",

            "body": "Addiction counselor here. Scientifically, it is due to the pleasure circuits in your brain get overwhelmed..this can be temporary or chronic depending on the length of time you were drinking. The reward system in the brain evolved in order to reinforce the behaviors we needed to survive...like eating. When we eat, the reward system floods the brain with dopamine, which then makes us feel good...this encourages you to eat again. When your brain becomes addicted to a substance, the brain then changes..due to the outsized response they trigger in our brains. So instead of a simple dopamine rush, many substances cause dopamine to flood the neural pathways...10x more than a normal dopamine surge. Your brain then remembers this surge and associates it with the substance..in your case alcohol. However, over time with chronic use of alcohol, our brains adapt to this flood of dopamine and it becomes less sensitive to it. Now your brain is doing everything it can to survive and achieve that flood of dopamine because it has been rewired to think you need the substance to literally survive. This is why you see addicts selling their kids and doing foul shit during active addiction. The substance becomes more important for the brain than anything else.\n\nSo for you, your brain heals..is rewired with new pathways when you are sober for a time, but as soon as you begin to feed that reward system again, which remains changed forever, regardless of sober time, your brain now craves the dopamine flood and you're right back to square one. Addicted brains cannot use substances in moderation. Hope this helps!",

It's either that or nothing and a lot of people choose nothing when they could train themselves to stop at a moderate amount.\n\nI know I'm treading dangerous territory for people but it just seems like a shame for a certain amount of people to never drink again when then can if they try with a goal in mind.
