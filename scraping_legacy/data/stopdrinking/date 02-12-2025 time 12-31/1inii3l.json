Not drinking feels like the right choice as I try to grapple with myriad pain issues. But damn is it hard, and there\u2019s really nothing I\u2019ve found that can replace it.\u00a0Ibuprofen and the like isn\u2019t strong enough and I don\u2019t want to take it all the time, and I sure as hell am not going the opiate route.\u00a0\n\nThe unfortunate reality appears to be that out of two crappy options, being sober and confronting the pain head on is the better of the two. Anyone that can relate?",

Getting sober meant that I lost the pain-relieving effects of alcohol, but it also meant that I got clearheaded enough to look at other options. In my case, an anti-inflammatory diet has done wonders for my health and pain level \u2013 it's been night and day. I hope you, too, are able to find a way to a life of less pain that does not include booze.",

But my pain was WAY worse than just good ol\u2019 sciatica. It would flare up and I missed weeks of work crying on my floor, sleeping on the hardwood floor to alleviate it, bought an inversion table- nothing worked. I\u2019d developed a limp over the years because of the pain. I just had to live life taking a lot of ibuprofen to take the edge off.\n\nI quit drinking April 8th 2024 and the pain gradually went away and I haven\u2019t felt it at all for the first time in years. I think my years of drinking exacerbated the pain I had and by quitting, it\u2019s like it was never there to begin with. It took a couple of months, but it\u2019s 100% gone.\n\nJust a thought.",

Now if I have a drink, I can feel the effects of my blood pressure rising.  \nI take opiates but I honestly dislike them.  There\u2019s no way I\u2019d get addicted because I hate how sleepy I feel.  I miss the old energetic me.  \nI\u2019ve replaced alcohol with guided healing meditations.  Free on YouTube and they work better than most drugs.  You can even just fall asleep listening to them.  I know exactly how you feel.  I\u2019ve been at my wits end for 38 years.  Chronic pain just sucks the life out of you.  Alcohol sucks the remaining life out of you.",

I know some people said cannabis as that was not an option for me with work drug test but maybe a viable option for you and even if it isn't. It's still way worth it to stop now. Maybe go see a pain management dr.",

It\u2019s not a perfect replacement as it is also habit forming and can really screw up your ability to sleep when you decide to stop using it, but it works great for me to get to sleep and keep me away from drinking.",

I quit drinking for different reasons but now when I look at alcohol, I associate it with sore joints and not being able to sleep. It keeps me from having \u2018just one\u2019 or trying to moderate because I no longer associate alcohol with fun but suffering. Even if alcohol wasn\u2019t the cause of my pain problems, being sober gave me the tools and energy to help solve them.",
