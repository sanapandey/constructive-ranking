    "selftext": "So here I am, back to day one (how can I reset my counter?). It\u2019s taken me ages to come here, I knew I had to, I\u2019ve not been honest with myself. \n\nI was completely sober for some four years and then over the last 18 months I\u2019ve been \u2018enjoying\u2019 the odd glass of wine, the odd pint. I\u2019ve been with my current partner for three years and he doesn\u2019t drink much, so every now and then I tell myself that I can enjoy drink in that way. And I was for about a year. \n\nBut now my Mum is dying and some things in my relationship have been difficult and so I\u2019ve started buying alcohol and drinking at home alone. I\u2019m not at the level that I was, and I have been able to do things like \u2018just have 3/4 of the bottle of wine\u2019, or \u2018buy two miniature bottles of wine for the evening\u2019. I\u2019m scared about the slippery slope, I\u2019m scared about my liver, I feel terrible about myself. Really terrible. To succeed for so long and then fail, it\u2019s really shit. I guess that\u2019s why I haven\u2019t come and asked for help until now, I feel lots of shame. \n\nSo here I am again, leaning on this community and asking not to drink with you today. Just today, first. And then tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow.",

I even had almost 4 years of sobriety way back but then my son got lost in the world of opiate addiction for a few years and well, I broke. He made it through as did I. Please keep faith in yourself. Sobriety is a journey - with many zigs and zags. Glad you\u2019re here \u2665\ufe0fIWNDWYT",
