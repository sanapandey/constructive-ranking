    "selftext": "After more than one year of alcohol addiction I decided that on January 9th I would become sober for as long as it benefits me. \nI realized I have substance issues and I binge anything that gives me immediate relief or pleasure. Alcohol caused many decisions, things said, time lost and money wasted so\n I decided no more. It felt like a flip switched and I knew I could either knowingly do something harmful toward myself or I could stop and feel better on down the line. \nI\u2019m feeling motivated and happy and feel like I can finally begin to start maintence on the real problems and things I want to learn, that will help me grow. The ones I used alcohol to numb & stunt my growth.\nHappy wendesday to you all",
