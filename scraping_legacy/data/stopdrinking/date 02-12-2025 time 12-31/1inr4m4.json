    "selftext": "A week sober now and my coworker said they'd love to have me at a going away party for another coworker that's at a bar. I work nights and thankfully it's on a day that I work so I could just say \"sorry, I have work\". She was saying I should call out and go the party but I just laughed it off. Really, part of me would love to call out and join but the bar is the last place I need to be at right now. I don't want to miss out on money either even if it means I have to endure another 10 hour shift at work. I didn't tell her that I'm a week into sobriety and trying to stay that way. Everyone at my job talks about drinking all the time, either from them it's a bottle of wine a day or a couple glasses of wine a day or several beers a day or going to the bar immediately after work and getting shitfaced. It's really hard to listen, makes me feel like I need to drink in order to feel included and have a social life. I already am used to being alone enough because I work nights so what difference is not drinking going to make. I don't like me when I drink and I wouldn't want to reveal the drunken side of me to people who only ever know the sober side of me. \n\nIt's been tough this week. Yesterday I was having a hard time sleeping and I felt really anxious so I felt this great temptation to go to the convenience store and get a tall boy so I could relax. I ended up making some valerian tea instead and that worked much better than alcohol. Wish me luck for the next few weeks",
