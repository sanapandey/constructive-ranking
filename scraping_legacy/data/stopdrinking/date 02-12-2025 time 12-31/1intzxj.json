    "selftext": "House of cards is one of my all time fave shows (for the first 2 seasons anyway. In season 2 Doug Stamper meets with Feng. Feng tempts him to a drink. With expensive as hell scotch in the way of an old fashioned. The way Doug: 1. admits he\u2019s still an alcoholic despite being in recovery for many years and 2. slaps that $40k scotch out of Fengs hand. I think that\u2019s the most \u2018real\u2019 portrayal of alcoholism I\u2019ve seen in a long time. Especially with the mantra, \u201cyou can only control your first drink.\u201d \nBut the way he slapped that drink in the \u2018nice try, I\u2019m not doing this bullshit\u2019 was. I think it\u2019s Doug\u2019s best episode for that alone and wish we got a spin off. I\n\nI know he\u2019s not real, but damn. The conviction in that scene. As an ex whiskey lover, I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve turned down $40k Macallan. But it was just so iconic for me to see in recovery myself. I was thinking about buying a bottle until I saw that. Alas. I will not drink tonight. Thanks House of Cards. ",

It was such a great feeling at the time I turned it away, but more so the next morning. \n\nIt still happens, yet I think I've become more accustomed to the feeling now. I should take some time to be grateful for the mornings of waking up sober. \n\nThanks for sharing",
