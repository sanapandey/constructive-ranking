    "selftext": "I thought I was doing okay, and even saving money compared to my peers. With food stamps I'd purchase gallons of juice, sugar, and yeast, and voila, in a week I'd have hard cider. \n\nSince it took time to make I though I could regulate my drinking, until Friday nights turned from making 2 gallons of hooch to 8 gallons. I still functioned enough to go to school (I graduated high school early with an associates degree, but dropped out of college when I was living alone with no reason to hide my drinking) and considered it a flex when other asked how I managed to always aquire alcohol in large quantities (I'm still below drinking age).\n\nI grew up around alcoholics, and from 10 years old my uncle and dad thought it'd be funny to give me some cognac or wine and see what happened. After a decade from stealing alcohol to eventually making it, I decided to stop drinking after having the most profound and shitty trip on acid while hungover (I don't condone nor recommend psychedlics to anyone, do your own research). \n\nI knew alcohol was poison, but I never visualized the exact way it poisoned my mind and body, until this trip outlined my brain fog, shitty sleep, bloated face, blacking out, waking up in vomit, actively killing myself when I'd never wish this on someone else.\n\nSince then if I smelled even a drop of alcohol from either hooch or hand sanitizer I'd start gagging. It was my body actively rejecting what is destroying it. I still tried to drink 2 times afterwards, the first time I was gagging with each sip and had to swallow the bile that rose, with the second I threw back up everything I worked so hard to drink into the cup.\n\nNow after only 2 weeks sober since the last drop of alcohol I can finally stay asleep throughout the night, I'm still having trouble falling asleep. My face cleared up and I can remember my previous activities from the day before. I know it's only been 15 days, but I don't ever want to touch that poison again.\n\nYes I no longer talk to some people cause they only want to hang out when intoxicated, and now I can't hide from my thoughts, but sobriety is beautiful. I don't remember the last time I was sober this long. You can see my previous post I nearly died choking on my own vomit a month or so back. \n\nBut I think I'm content now. ",

Psychedelics can extremely powerful tools of transformation. This experience doesn't surprise me at all ~ psychedelics often act as medicine, bringing us insights and realizations we sometimes don't think we want or know that we need. I am so happy that you had this experience and that it had such a profound effect on you. You deserve to live a fulfilling and wholehearted life ~ you deserve to thrive!! Alcohol steals that opportunity from us. \n\nWishing you all the best! \ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd0d",

I never made a true life lasting change from within until I stopped everything.\n\nAnyone else can enjoy and defend drug use and that's fine for them.
