    "selftext": "\u201cFriday 2/12/21\n\nAs of today, I will no longer drink alcohol!\u201d\n\n\nI remember writing this on a sticky-note at work, a few days after blacking out (again). Who knew that this piece of paper would actually hold me accountable?\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just that. I really was so emotionally and physically exhausted from blacking out so much. My couldn\u2019t handle the amount I drank. My friends and loved ones couldn\u2019t either, and I ruined so many relationships \u2014 especially the relationship with myself. And it\u2019s been an ongoing problem since college (I was in a sorority at a Big 10 school).\n\nThere was a deeper root to my problematic drinking, and it was that I had so much unhealed trauma that I refused or was too scared to face for years and years. I finally buckled down hard in therapy, changed the focus as to why I turned to drinking (suppress feelings of anxiety, guilt, trauma) and learned healthier habits and thought processes to mitigate those high emotions. I told basically everyone I socialized with that I\u2019m not drinking anymore to hold myself even more accountable, and so that they knew to start stocking up on alcohol-free beverages. They\u2019ve been so supportive.\n\nIt eventually got to the point where I felt comfortable being in bars, going to parties and weddings, where others were drinking. I remember telling my therapist that I was scared of having FOMO because everyone else would be drinking and \u201chaving fun without me.\u201d A few years later, maybe 2 years into my sobriety, a coworker at a work offsite was astounded that I haven\u2019t had an ounce of alcohol all night and that \u201cI\u2019m just naturally fun.\u201d And honestly, it\u2019s feels SO much better knowing that I\u2019ll actually remember the night and be in total control because I\u2019m not imbibing in alcohol. Unlike all those times I blacked out.\n\nI never thought I could do this back then. I really thought it\u2019d be impossible \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ve ended up in the hospital several times for alcohol poisoning back in college. A few years ago, I became a brand ambassador for a non-alcoholic spirits company for a bit and have inspired more friends to stop (or reduce) drinking. If I can do it, so can you.\n\nIf it\u2019s your first day, congrats! If it\u2019s your first day for the x amount of time, congrats! If you\u2019ve been sober for x amount of years like me, congrats!\n\n*IWNDWYT.*\n\n",
