    "selftext": "I have a 5 month old Australian shepherd puppy, she\u2019s incredibly smart and an incredible amount of work lol. But for the most part our training and routine has been going very well. A couple months ago she randomly started becoming reactive towards other people and dogs, whenever she\u2019d spot a person or dog (from any distance) she\u2019d freak out, lunging, barking, biting at my coat and legs, etc. I\u2019ve been extremely consistent in working on her training every single day, I\u2019ve been able to get her reactivity towards others fairly under control with the engage/disengage method as well as counter conditioning. Most days we can walk past many people on the road and other dogs and she won\u2019t react unless they\u2019re very close so I always give distance when walking past others. Our issue now is that if we are near another person walking their dog and their dog starts barking/lunging/growling toward my dog first then it\u2019s basically fair game in her head and she begins freaking out reacting in response. I always give distance when walking past other dogs (like crossing to the other side of the street) and I begin the engage/disengage game the second I spot a dog so I can keep my puppy focused on me, but the second another dog barks at her it is game over and nothing will stop her from reacting. Has anyone else had this issue? Or have any tips on how I can help my puppy just stay chill and focused? ",

I\u2019ve done a lot of research but am unable to find any advice on how to help my dog ignore other reactive dogs. I\u2019ve been able to help my dogs reactivity myself, but I still need advice on preventing reactions towards other dogs who initiate reactivity first",
