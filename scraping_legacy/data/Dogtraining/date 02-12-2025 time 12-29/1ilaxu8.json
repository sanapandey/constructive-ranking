    "selftext": "I read through other posts about keeping the dog off the bed, but haven\u2019t found anything about this specific issue. My dog was doing great at keeping to her blanket on the foot of the bed until we moved. She then started sleeping up near the top of my bed. \n\nI just don\u2019t want her on my pillows or at the top of my bed. I got a larger dog blanket that covers the whole bed which helped for a while. Now I\u2019m coming home and finding her having shoved the blanket out of the way and gotten into my bed under the covers! That\u2019s never been allowed and she\u2019s usually really good about understanding that her blankets = where she\u2019s allowed. How do I deal with this? It never happens while I\u2019m home, only when I leave the house.",

I\u2019ve generally found stuff about stopping the dog from getting on or off the couch or beds at all, generally by blocking access. I could do that, but am wondering if people have advice for allowing access to specific parts of the bed but preventing this new behavior of going off her blanket and under the covers.",
