    "selftext": "I was going to train my friends at-home service dog, but I can't even get to training him first until I fix this. \n\nHe associates trying to give him a treat with trying to catch him, so he either bounds away, barks, or stares at you for a few minutes before walking off to do something else (he does show interest, but repeats mentioned behaviors). \n\nI also can't work on his leash skills without treats, and if I tried to offer him a treat within the same hour, he won't come to go outside (he thinks you're trying to catch him), even if he wants to. \n\nI've tried sitting there with the treat in my hand, and other methods. I also leashed him, but at that point he's more interested in going outside instead of taking treats. He needs basic training first to even listen outside. \n\nTldr; I need help trying to break the association of offering food = I'm trying to trap you. \n\nEdit: Didn't know I needed to clarify since my question wasn't about training him to be an At-home SD. At-home service dog means he stays at home. No pa, 2-3 tasks, and basic training. This behaviour is from the family luring him with things he likes to catch him, so he stays out of my reach as a result. As the tldr states. ",

If once they get to this point the dog is able to learn to assist its owner with their disability around the home then great, if it turns out it has more anxiety issues that prevent it from achieving this then it won't pass its tests but hopefully at the end of the day it will be less fearful, the family will learn how to get it to come in a way that doesn't result in the dog being distressed and the dog will learn some basic obedience and overall be happier for the autonomy that gives it.",

I caught on pretty quickly and started only offering treats when I didn\u2019t need to do anything with her. If I had to grab her to do her nails or something I would leash her, bring her where I needed her and treat her afterwards. \n\nThe other thing that can be helpful is just dropping treats when you walk by. I\u2019d drop one in her food dish, one on the bed she was lying on. Eventually she started seeking me out because she was pretty sure I was just a walking treat dispenser.\n\nBest of luck!",
