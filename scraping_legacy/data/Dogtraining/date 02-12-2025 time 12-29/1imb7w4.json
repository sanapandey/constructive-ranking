    "selftext": "I recently adopted a new 4 year old female pit mix as a friend for my 3 year old male. They we doing fine together until I brought home another 8 week old female puppy. The new additions seem to be stressing out my male dog, especially with the puppy. There have already been 2 serious fights with the older dogs since I brought the puppy home. I am desperately looking for solutions to be able to keep them all safely. Please help! TIA",
