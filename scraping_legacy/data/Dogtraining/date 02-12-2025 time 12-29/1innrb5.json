    "selftext": "Hey! I got married about four months ago and my wife has had her blue heeler for 8 years. We live on a ranch and have about 150ish head of cattle. He is a super smart dog, however he is a massive doofus. Due to lack of time and training he doesn\u2019t do much with cows. He spins them in circles and just causes issues. I\u2019ve been working with him, my only experience is helping friends and their dogs. He is different than any other dog I\u2019ve worked with though. (Worked with is a loose term, I\u2019ve taught friends dogs tricks and stuff but by no means any training or any true experience. I just like trying new things and the challenge.) We are currently night calving so we\u2019ve had time to work with him. I\u2019ve taught him how to spin, sit and wait before coming inside (and sometimes before going outside but we don\u2019t enforce this like we do with him coming in), he knew how to sit and lay down, he heels and will follow us but is pretty easily distracted and needs reminders semi frequently. He is still a fairly hyperactive dog even though he\u2019s older. Because of this he struggles with focusing even when we\u2019re training. I\u2019ll keep reading because I saw the part about hyperactive tendencies and stuff. Was more so curious if there\u2019s any good recommendations on how to continue his training to maybe even being able to be in a field with cattle and not leave us, or even just stay put and not worry. Also wondering how far I can go with training him? He\u2019s definitely ingrained with some habits (ie when he sits or lays down he circles around you and sits behind or next to you like 3/10 times) so what are some good places to start or is it worth taking the time to try or should we just leave him be because of his age? Thank you! I\u2019m open to anything!",

Never to hurt it or anything just to get its attention. I\u2019ve heard that it relates to them being puppies kinda like cats getting scruffed? I read the guide and didn\u2019t find too many answers specific to my needs, however it seems like it\u2019d be helpful to most!",

Or the ABCs of problem solving?",

If he\u2019s hungry and the cat\u2019s food bowl is in reach, he\u2019s going to want to eat from the bowl. We don\u2019t do leash training because we are out in no where Montana so there was no reason to, however I was thinking about starting. That\u2019s another reason why I reached out here! I didn\u2019t see the training section thank you! The hiking sections aren\u2019t available to me, I think that\u2019d be the closest thing to us working in the fields. Just looking for some guidance! Thanks.",
