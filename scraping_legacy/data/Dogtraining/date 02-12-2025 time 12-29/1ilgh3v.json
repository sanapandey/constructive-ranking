    "selftext": "I have a 9wk standard poodle. She is doing great with potty training. We take her out every 2 hours and keep a pee pad out for emergency. I have noticed she will big pee out side but every 10mins inside she piddles on the pad. Just small little tinkles. I don't remember any of my past puppies doing this. How can I train her to old it for the 2 hours?",
