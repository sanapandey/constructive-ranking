    "selftext": "We have a 1.5 yo Wheaten Terrier and a newborn baby. Our dog has always been overexcited around guests and now we have more frequent visitors coming to meet baby, help us out etc. \n\nWe have a big sectional in our living room where people would ideally like to sit with baby. However, our dog loves jumping up on the sofa to lick guests\u2019 faces, which is not safe or socially acceptable. \n\nWe have so far avoided this issue by having guests visit in the nursery, which is gated off, but it\u2019s cramped and not ideal. \n\nWe have tried (without baby) having the dog on leash while people sit on the sofa, but he starts barking after about 15 minutes. Same thing if we crate him with a good chew - he\u2019ll be quiet for awhile but then starts barking. \n\nHow do I help him crate calmly while guests are over? At some point I\u2019d like to have him settle uncrated with guests around, but I think we\u2019re pretty far from that.  \n\nThanks for any help! ",

He can settle on a mat, has a good leave it, and can place on his bed near the sectional - but cannot keep this up for long if guests are around. He can relax on cue outside his crate, and can relax quietly inside his crate, if it\u2019s just us at home. When there are new people in the home he finds all of these behaviors very challenging.",
