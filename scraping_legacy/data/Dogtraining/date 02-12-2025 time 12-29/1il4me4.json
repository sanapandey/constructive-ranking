    "selftext": "Please give me some advice. My husband adopted a GSD from a shelter who didn't have much information on her. They said she might be between 5 months and 1-year-old. They didn't give us any information on the trauma in her previous life said she was discovered on the street, and very close to being put down.\n\nShe was very calm and fearful in the shelter, But when we got her home we discovered that she is extremely aggressive towards other dogs, wants to attack every single dog she sees. She pulls on the leash so hard to get at them that she almost knocks me over.\n\nShe is also very excitable. As soon as she sees me my husband or my young son, She is wagging so hard her whole body is moving and constantly jumping up and licking or nipping at us. She is always trying to dart between our legs and get outside the house or the gate and doesn't listen when you say no or stop She just pulls away from you and does what she wants anyway. \n\nI've tried giving her playtime recommended for her breed, I literally spent all day with her trying to expend her energy yesterday and she was still hyper at the end of the day. \n\nShe loves praise but doesn't seem praise motivated. She loves snacks but She doesn't seem to want to perform for snacks. \n\nI've tried the techniques in the wiki for calmness and jumping, But nothing seems to be working. She doesn't even give me the chance to teach her a new technique because she just jumps four or five times a second and doesn't stop to listen. She knows what to do and refuses to. Example , She's caught on to the command \"sit\" and knows what it is, But won't follow it. she just jumps up and licks my face, or pulls very hard on the leash to get me to get let go and let her go attack something. \n\nMy husband has no experience with dogs and I warned him not to get a GSD, But he didn't listen. My own experience with dogs is with very small dogs and a Golden retriever, and they act nothing like her, So I am stumped. They were very easy to train and calm as puppies. This little girl is extremely hyper to the point She runs into the wall and hurts herself.",

If I put a treat on the floor she will still jump up and start licking and nipping really hard. After the person has ran away from her or left the room she will then go get the treat. \n\nShe has lots of chew toys and lots of outdoor time to get her energy out. I've read The articles suggested in the calmness section. There's one that mentions being overexcited by food and she's like this all the time about anything. She gets over excited when she sees any human. And will not calm down even if you hold her in your lap. She will sit there wiggling really hard trying to jump out of your arms and jump up and lick your face and she can't just lay down quietly next to you. She refuses to go to sleep or lay down unless I turn all the lights off in her bedroom and leave her alone.",

Don\u2019t use aversives like a prong, bark, or choke collar, do not hit, yell or punish. Do you have a fenced yard? I\u2019d keep her in there instead of walking for now. She needs time to decompress. She\u2019s probably also not leashed trained and is either frustration barking, reactive, or dog aggressive. Keep things as calm as you can. Putting her in a room is great. Make sure she has large kennel to go in when she\u2019s scared and try draping a blanket over it so it\u2019s more like a den. Start giving her some enrichment like a kong filled with ground turkey and canned green beans then frozen or Greek yogurt and a little pumpkin and frozen. Licking helps a dog destress. German shepherds are very smart and coachable. This is all fixable but you need a professional or call the shelter back and ask for help. They may send someone over.",

Imagine learning a new instrument and expecting to play it perfectly after a week of practice. This is no different. It takes time. As you work through it, never forget to give yourself and your dog grace.\n\nGSDs can be neurotic and benefit from a lot of structure, repetition, and strong leadership to overcome it. They need more patience than your average dog. But once you get your breakthrough, you'll find things start to move much more quickly. But you need to invest the time to build the trust and expectations.",

It sounds blunt but telling a dog \u2018no\u2019 means absolutely nothing to them and it\u2019s only by consistently attaching a word to a situation that they will learn. For example if you want them to stop picking up shoes you choose a word and say it every time you take the shoe out of their mouth- you could say \u2018no\u2019, \u2018drop it\u2019 or \u2018bananas\u2019 but it\u2019s saying the word at the same time as the action. You also say the word when they do the action naturally as well. This takes a lot of time to get them to understand. \n\nOur gsd also jumped up a lot; it\u2019s excitement or nervous energy and when they are in that excited state they aren\u2019t listening (just like toddlers lol) so saying \u2018sit\u2019 or anything is just a waste. We would cross our arms and close our eyes until the jumping stopped then engage with our dog, and immediately close our arms and eyes and stand up again the moment he jumped. It would take about 10 attempts each time multiple times a day. But he got it within a month or so. We did the same for play biting. I called it a \u2018reverse time out\u2019 because it was like putting ourselves in time out so we weren\u2019t rewarding the bad behaviour with attention. \n\nThere are loads of training tips we got from professional dog trainers near us, and gsd clubs near us. It bought help you to find some local support too. Good luck with your pup.",

My dog gets extra jumpy and bitey when he needs a nap.   \n  \nA great time to enforce a nap is during a really normal routine of yours, like while doing dishes or folding laundry. Keep her in eye sight so she can watch you but not move around: either in a crate or tethered to furniture. The tether should be short enough so she can lay/sit, but not walk around. \n\nReward her every time she settles/quiets with praise or treats. If this is all new, it might mean rewards every 10 - 30 seconds. My dog learned that while I am doing dishes, I am not going anywhere but also not paying attention to him besides rewarding \"quiet\" and \"settle\" so it was a good way to practice being calm near me. \n\nGiving her a peanut butter filled kong or a sturdy chew toy may help too. I recommend the ring shaped Benebone. Fill the kong or bone with peanute butter and freeze it. (https://www.benebone.com/products/ring?\\_pos=8&\\_fid=51860dcb5&\\_ss=c&variant=40639517392995)",

We adopted her because the foster said she was the chillest puppy he ever had, just wants to follow you around the house and love on you. No. Wrong. The second day she was home she woke up and chose mania. Biting, jumping, barking, biting, more biting. I cried a lot and tried to wear her out every day and she just kept racheting up more.\n\nThree weeks in and she was learning the schedule and mellowing out. She\u2019s still exhausting - she\u2019s a teenage GSD - but rounding out a month I can see the light ahead that she\u2019ll be a good dog. We do mini training sessions all throughout the day. Positive reenforcement only. Tons of impulse control games to tire her out. Taught crate and place commands right away. We tether her to us inside if she\u2019s struggling to relax or gets bitey. Long sniffy walks and lots of boxes and things to shred so she can feel mischievous. We have a long way to go, but she\u2019s a fast learner and it already feels like a different dog. \n\nIf your dog is new to your house she is probably overtired and still decompressing. Try practicing capturing calmness and dropping a treat whenever she\u2019s still. Look up the relaxation protocol and try it. Focus on teaching place and crate commands. Tether her to you. Get a few kongs to fill with frozen food to keep on rotation. Try yak chews or lick mats or bulky sticks too - GSDs seem to need to chew to self calm. She may be like ours and need you to show her what relaxed looks like. It\u2019s made a world of difference surprisingly quickly once we found ways that clicked with her. Good luck!",

My family what at a point that we thought we may need to rehome him. He was full of love but as he got bigger him hurting my son was the biggest concern. I found a different training who herself had Aussies. It was a lifesaver! My pup is still full of energy but he doesn\u2019t bulldoze anyone, he doesn\u2019t jump on everything. He is living his best life now. \n\n\nTLDR: Find a trainer who works with GSD.",

            "body": "GSD owner since 1970. \n\nWhat you are experiencing isn't all that uncommon. GSDs can be pretty tough pups to raise, and not for the faint of heart. You don't say how long you have had her, but she is probably still adjusting to her new life.\n\nI am surprised that estimate of her age is such a large gap. Has she been to a vet? Pretty sure that would help to pin it down somewhat. And it would be helpful for you to know what stage of her life she is in.\n\nThere is the  possibility of trauma having lived on the street. but from what you said, it makes me think the dog is over stimulated. Much of her behavior exhibits that. Young dogs need a good deal of sleep. More than you would think. And teething could also be an issue. But it is also likely she is just a hyper over tired baby.\n\nI have never crate trained any of my dogs. Used child/dogs gates instead. But many find crates useful. Plus dogs, especially GSDS need a space to call their own. But, you must never use it to try and control her behavior.\n\nAs to your training at home ......... You need some practical advice. And everyone in the household needs to be onboard, not just you. And you all need to use the same methods, and be consistent. Your best option is to find a good, recommended, ethical trainer. And I am a big believer in training classes, not just one on one training. Training classes are great opportunities for dogs to learn to be good dog citizens in a controlled environment. And the sooner the better.\n\nI will warn you. Most, not all, GSDs are handfuls until about 2 years old. Their brain kicks in about then. Female brains may kick in a bit sooner. Though there is a running joke among GSD owners that the time before they are two is called  the \"velociraptor\" period.",

            "body": "I strongly recommend you get a trainer who's familiar with the *German Shepherd breed. Cannot say this strongly enough. Should have booked a trainer the day you brought the dog home.  \n\nThey'll be able to tell you right away a lot closer estimation of the dog's age. There is a huge difference between the appearance of a five month old and the appearance of a 12 month old German Shepherd.  A German Shepherd at 5 or 6 months old is all ears tails and feet.   By one year old the body has (mostly) caught up with all those sticking out parts \ud83d\ude04\n\nBeing reactive is quite normal for a German Shepherd. All dogs go through a first and second fear period.  One when they're a very young puppy and the second towards the end of their first year. With German shepherds these can be very intense because they are very alert. If the dog isn't properly trained and socialized you could wind up with a dog that's a danger to everyone.",

Maybe this dog is going to need a little more work than you bargained for, and she is still a puppy/teen. I guess do some soul searching on if you and your family are going to be able to invest the time and resources to develop her into the awesome dog she has potential to be. It can certainly be overwhelming. I hope you find the right support to help you through! Good luck!",

            "body": "You have to be both patient and persistent with the dog. Training takes time. A lot of time. Weeks. Sometimes months. Sessions have to be kept short. No more than 15 mins each. Often shorter to start with. Your dog will let you know when she's had enough. Don't ignore her signals and keep pushing her; it'll be wasted effort. No more than 2-3 sessions per day. In the meantime, you have to manage the undesireable behavior. Everyone in the household does. If one person in the household keeps slipping her food from the table, they are enabling her behavior. If she's jumping on the table repeatedly, someone is letting her. That has to stop. Call a family meeting and assert that this behavior is not cool and she won't grow out of it if they keep enabling her. If she's hyper excited seeing family members, they need to understand to ignore her until she calms down, or else it results in rewarding her hyper-excited behavior.\n\nIt sounds like she may be cranky from lack of enough sleep; dogs need 14-16 hours of sleep per day, that is, per 24-hour period. Get a crate and train her to use it. It should be large enough for her to stand up in, turn around in, and be able to stretch in, but no larger. Make it comfy by putting some blankets in there or even a dog bed. She should not have enough of a \"separate\" space for pottying. She needs to learn that alone time is good and you'll be back. If she refuses to use the crate, settle while in the create, especially when you leave the room, or flat out panics when you close the door, she may have confinement and/or separation anxiety disorders. In that case, you definitely need to engage a veterinary behaviorist because she may need the help of medication to be able to adequetly focus on training for her reactive behaviors.",

Use a leash in the house if you need to. If she's too excited to listen, then wait her out. If she's pulling, stand your ground until she realizes her way won't work. \n\nMake her sit for everything. Food, water, toys, treats, praise, going outside, when people are at the door or coming in. literally anything she gets excited for. Like you said, she knows what you're saying. You're teaching her she doesn't get what she wants until she does what you want, and you always want that calm behavior.\n\n She's still a puppy. You just need to be patient and consistent. There's no reason she can't catch on quick if you're consistent. This has worked with me for my GS, my Australian shepherd, and when I watched my neighbors hyperactive Golden Doodle for the weekend.",
