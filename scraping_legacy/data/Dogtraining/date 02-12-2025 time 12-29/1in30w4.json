    "selftext": "My dog does this low level whining constantly through the day. He\u2019s been to the vet, we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s anything physical. He\u2019s currently on 40mg of Prozac a day along with 100mg of trazadone twice a day - he\u2019s a very anxious dog, super sound sensitive. \n\nAnyway. I\u2019ve been trying to do things like the relaxation protocol, or waiting out his whining. I must not have done a good enough job paying attention to his signs because he learned to bring it down to this lower level. So now it\u2019s really difficult to tell when he\u2019s actually relaxed because he can give me the body signs he is, head down, laying down on one hip, and if there\u2019s enough noise around (the tv, people talking etc.) I won\u2019t necessarily hear him whining. \n\nSo I feel like I\u2019ve reinforced this. And it makes training so stressful because I feel like I\u2019m messing up every time. And if I just try to wait it out it can take literally over an hour of sitting waiting for him to stop whining. Which doesn\u2019t feel beneficial because it\u2019s not really tiring him out in any meaningful way to keep him calm for a while for me to get work done. And I feel like I\u2019m never doing it right anyway. And this noise just grates on me so much partially because it\u2019s annoying partially because every time I hear him whine I just think about how I\u2019ve messed this up and just feel like an awful owner because he\u2019s obviously not happy. \n\nAny help or tips would be appreciated.

We have really upped the amount of general training we do. Which he enjoys doing because he loves treats of any kind, to the point I\u2019m not really sure how much he is learning because he\u2019s so over excited to train. \n\nEven if my dog has been walked, has had a chew or a Kong, played he will default to this behavior when he is awake. He will nap through the day but the majority of the time he is awake he is whining. \n\nI am going to ask my vet to see if we should switch to gabapentin, maybe the trazadone is having an opposite effect.",
