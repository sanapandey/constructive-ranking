    "selftext": "Please help-- we are desperate and out of ideas.\n\nSeeking help for my dog (~6 yo, fixed male schnauzer/APBT mix, rescued from a county shelter at 1 yo) who has extreme Anxiety/panic in Cars. Context: he has generalized anxiety and takes daily fluoxetine and gabapentin. It takes edge off but he's still reactive, mostly to noises (trembles, hides, lip licking, whale eye).\n\nFrom the first day we adopted him, our dog has has extreme panic in cars. It doesn't seem to be caused by motion sickness, as he begins panicking before the car moves. He appears excited to get into the car, but at soon as the door closes he displays the following:\n\n-extreme drooling \n\n-yelping, whining, barking\n\n-chewing on car seats, doors/handles, anything he can reach. We've given him bones to chew instead, which works for a while but eventually he'll go back to chewing the car. He also chews HARD when stressed, so there are limited bones he won't immediately destroy and that won't cause him to break teeth.\n\n-jumping around the backseat (we seat belt him to backseat so he cannot jump to front)\n\n-licking windows obsessively-- typically turns into chewing the area under the window or even trying to bite window. \n\n\nThis is unsafe for the driver and means we can't go anywhere with him (e.g., vet or dogsitter) unless there's a passenger to monitor him. It's also exhausting.\n\nWe've tried:\n\nMeds:\n\n-CBD (did nothing)\n\n-benadryl (did nothing)\n\n-trazadone (makes him tired loopy before/after the drive but does almost nothing during)\n\n-alprazolam (did nothing)\n\n-gabapentin (he takes daily, vet said we can updose for the car-- doesn't seem to do much for car).\n\n-acepromazine (barely takes the edge off so he doesn't constantly scream/yelp, but only barely. Makes him extremely tired after car ride)\n\n\nTraining:\n\n-positive reinforcement in the car: he usually loves food but won't take most treats. There are a few things he will take (peanut butter) but he takes it and immediately begins panicking.\n\n-phased approach to getting him used to car: rewards for being close to car, getting in car, working up to it. Problem is he has a definite \"cliff\"-- he doesn't react to car when near it, seems to want to get in, is ok when doors are open, but we can't get past the panic after the door close. Reinforcing the non reaction before doors close doesn't seem to do anything bc his reaction is so strong after they close.\n\n-crate: he loves his crate inside, but we tried it in the car a few times and he got so panicked he tried to claw and bite his way out. We worried he was going to hurt himself.\n\n-someone sitting with him in the back: still panics\n\nWe are desperately looking for help and ideas. This is currently horrible for his quality of life and ours. Please please help us. Thank you!",
