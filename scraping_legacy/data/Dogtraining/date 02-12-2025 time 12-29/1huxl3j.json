    "selftext": "#Welcome to the quarterly Event List!\n\nHere we crowdsource upcoming events in the animal training world (for the next 6 months) to add to our calendars, and help each other plan to expand our knowledge (and meet CEU requirements).  \n\n##REQUIREMENTS  \n\nEvents should comply with the following standards:   \n\n* Organisation/trainer running the event meets the criteria for trainer recommendations in the [posting guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/guidelines) and [wiki guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/findingatrainer)  \n* Major conferences, workshops and events only - it should be something that is sufficiently extensive and/or unique that it might be worth travelling and paying accommodation for if you are not directly local to it. Use this as a hypothetical question if it is an online event/conference. Events run by individual trainers should be by an already industry-recognised expert and offering CEUs; think Shikashio running his Aggression in Dogs conference or a Terry Ryan Chicken Camp, not your local CPDT-KA running their first public workshop.   \n* Professional - information provided sufficiently in-depth to have value to a professional as well as a hobbyist. No workshops intended solely for the general public, please.  \n* Events should be time-limited: the purpose of these posts is to help us all not miss events that have application/attendance deadlines and happen once a year at most, particularly at variable time schedules. If it's a webinar that is available on demand or has access granted every few months like clockwork, it's not suitable for this thread - send [a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/Dogtraining) to suggest it be included in the wiki instead.  \n* The event will happen in the next 6 months (or the application deadline closes within the next 6 months). If the event is further in the future, it should go in a future quarterly thread. There is a separate Automod comment below to drop the names of such future events here as advance alerts with limited detail.   \n \nEvents do *not* need to be dog-exclusive, just something that dog trainers and keen hobbyists would enjoy! For example, we wouldn't post a cat-only conference, but we *would* love to see a conference by PPG or IAABC that includes both dog and cat seminars, or a conference by animal behaviour researchers that has broad cross-species applicability.  \n\n###FORMAT  \n\nPlease post under the appropriate Automoderator comment below to group events by LOCATION (Online, Europe, North America or Other)  \n\nSuggested posting format:  \n\n**Event Name** - the name, obviously, for easy searching  \n**Date** - Please post in ISO standard format YYYY-MM-DD to eliminate any risk of confusion between USA and rest of the world date formats  \n**Location** - Online or Country-State-City  \n**Organiser** - Name of event organiser(s)  \n**Website** - link to detailed information  \n**Special info** - anything important to know in advance - e.g. early bird price close date, available scholarships, link to facebook group for event where people are organising carpools and accommodation sharing etc.  \n\nCode for copying format:  \n\n    **Event Name** -  \n    **Date** -   \n    **Location** -  \n    **Organiser** -  \n    **Website** -   \n    **Special info** -",
