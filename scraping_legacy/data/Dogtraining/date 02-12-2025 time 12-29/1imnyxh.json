    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently rescued a German shepherd husky mix, and we have progressed immensely in the three weeks I\u2019ve had her.\n\nThe only thing that she is currently struggling with (that I find concerning) is her bite inhibition, or lack thereof.\n\nAfter reading the wiki, as well as other sources online I am seeing that it is very difficult, if not impossible to train bite inhibition in a dog above 6 months old. \n\nShe does not respond to yelps/screams as my other dogs in the past have learned. What I have been doing is getting up and leaving the room when she bites too hard. The problem is that when she is playing she ALWAYS bites too hard.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice, and has anyone successfully trained an older puppy to bite gently when playing?\n",
