    "selftext": "Hello!\nGonna be long so please bare with me:\n\nSo, mid december i went through and adopted a 5 yr old intact male from my local shelter.\nHe\u2019s 6.5 kgs and apparently a mix of Pincher and some sort of Terrier, named Bilbo ( yep, like Bilbo Baggins).\nWe dont know anything about his background, just that he was found roaming with no microchip and that has been in the shelter, quarantined, for a month and a half prior to adoption, as per local laws.\nAt the beginning he was pretty much shutdown but he slowly opened up a bit and there are some behaviours that are\u2026 proving challenging to say the least:\n\nFirst and foremost: Marking \nHe was marking literally every day in every corner especially at night or when i wasnt looking (like i have two rooms, not a mansion and he stilll managed to do that while i was in the bathroom). I tried moving his last walk (of 4 total in the day) later at around 9pm while i usually wake up between 7 and 8 and removing the water when we are back and it didnt do much. What made things improve was bringing him to sleep with me. ( he has a bed, that went pretty much overlooked since day one besides treats and cuddles and praises). That brought the marking down by - a lot-  to the point i thought it solved. Nope.\nHe did it again twice this week.\nFirst time it was the first day i was away for half a day ( i work from home everyday, just had to go in the office that one day. I tried to get someone come in but my mom was sick and i was away. From 7 am to 4 pm, left him treats scattered around to sniff, his kong, tv on with music) and second time today. I was here all day\u2026and god knows\u2026i probably fell asleep on the couch idk.. i just know i noticed at some point before dinner the smell and yeah, he peed the unused dog bed. \nOfc i didnt scold him and cleaned with enzy cleaner before throwing it in the washing machine\u2026 but idk i feel defeated.\n\nWhen i was out he didnt even touched the treats or kong. He waited for me.\n\nI hired a trainer and he said he\u2019s too attached and he knows he can get everything from me so we\u2019re gonna work on this and on basic obedience\u2026 and i hope it works.\n\nHe learnt his sit and offers it spontaneously but doesnt listen to me pretty much at all, maybe 40% even when i have treats and definetely not outside.\n\nI love him to pieces, pet him often and have a very strict routine (yay autism) but i feel so confused. I thought there would be some improvement so far and i dont know if it\u2019s normal that things are still so rocky\n\nAny imput is welcome and thanks for putting up with me\n",
