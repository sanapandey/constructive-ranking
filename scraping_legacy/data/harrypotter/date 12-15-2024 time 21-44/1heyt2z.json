Etc forever. The only times we see it used are specific circumstances. Usually it's planned out before the thing they're trying to impact happens (Hermione's classes), and therefore exempt from that paradox because she doesn't only decide to do it after seeing the results of not doing it. That's why when Hermione forgets to go to class, she doesn't just use the time turner to fix it, because she knows it won't work.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn the case of Sirius, it's to give them more time to fix a future problem (Sirius is going to be handed to the dementors very soon). Again, they're not trying to fix something bad that already happened. Even when they end up trying to do just that (saving buckbeak), it's a byproduct of the original goal, so they still leave their past selves with motive to do it again. That's why nothing actually changes the second time around, they just understand it better.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIf they'd gone back in time just to save buckbeak, or waited until it was too late to save Sirius, it wouldn't have worked because whatever you do can't remove the incentive for the next \"you\" to go back and do it too.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt's still an underutilized tool, there are other instances where extra time would be helpful, but most of those happen after the time turners are destroyed, so at least there's a reason they didn't use one (excluding the theory of Dumbledore having his own).",

No, the classism/racism in the organisation is just too great.\n\nThat timeturner belonged to Dumbledore and he gave it to Hermione because he's been using it in an avengers: endgame dr.

Someone correct me if I fucked up somewhere- I'm terrible with numbers.*\n\n>*There's 10 months in the school term, or about 40 weeks. We take 2 weeks off for Christmas break and another 2 off for Easter. That's 36 weeks. We know that Hermione drops 2 classes at the end of 3rd Year, giving her a normal schedule, so we can guess that's 2 classes a week she was Turning for (ignoring Divination for the moment). Let's assume that each of those classes amounted to 5 hours a week. That's 10 hours she was Turning back every week. 10 hrs x 36 weeks = 360 hrs. 360 hrs / 24 = 15 days.*\n\n>*Now let's add Divination to the pot. Hermione dropped it right before Easter holiday, which is around late March/early April. That gives us roughly 7 months of her attending the class, minus 2 weeks for Christmas, leaving us with 26 weeks. Let's assume again that Divination was 5 hours a week. 5 hrs x 26 weeks = 130 hrs. 130 hrs / 24 = 5.4166 repeating.*\n\n>*This leaves us with a rough estimate of 20.5-ish days of total extra life lived during Hermione's 3rd Year. Even if we double it, that's only 41-ish days, which falls well short of a year.*",
