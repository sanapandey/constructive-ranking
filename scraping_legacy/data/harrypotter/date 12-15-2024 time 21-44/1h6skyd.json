And I\u2019d argue, may be the biggest event by the time we get to that series.\u201d\n\nThe show is expected to run for seven seasons, with each adapting one of the books in J.K. Rowling\u2019s series. It was recently announced that the show would see Succession duo Francesca Gardiner as its writer and showrunner, and Mark Mylod as director on multiple episodes.\n\nSo far, no one has been cast in the upcoming HBO series, though open castings for the series leads opened in the UK and Ireland in September.\"\n\nSo they give no reason for the delay at all. The quote comes right after the articles states the show will be delayed.",

The movies work because they make the moments from the books into spectacles and larger than life.  In a tv series, i feel like they're going to feel truncated and episodic so moments from the books are going to feel like chapters and i think that will just be a very different feel for the story.  I just dont have high hopes for this- how many tv shows have we heard based on books that promise are going to be faithful to the books only to change random details, and then start adding new unrelated elements and narratives not in the book?  I think a harry potter tv show is going to do that as well. no question",

Stranger Things S1 was like half a year of filming for instance. But even then, if they started filming now, took an entire year (which is way longer than usual), then did post-production for half a year (which is also longer than usual), it would still be mid 2026. They're saying it's delayed until 2027, when they already announced the show over a year ago. Announcing a show means they've done pre-production steps already. At the very least, attached a showrunner/writer/director to it to get the script written. Which means they've been in the pre-production stage for over a year now (which is a lot longer than usual). If you're saying it's not a delay, and is normal for a season of a TV show to take 4 years to make, start to finish (2023-2027), then I'm gonna have to disagree whole-heartedly with you on that. It is most definitely a delay. Hopefully for the better. If the studio delayed something like this, that's gonna make them shit tons of money, then I would hope they did it for a good reason and want to do it right. I can only hope that's the case.",

But when I consider HP1, yeah there is cut content, but they could never make an entire series about it.\n\nThe 2.5 hour long movie captures the essence of the book. You could add a few scenes, extend some to make them more dramatic, but in the end how much more would we get? Maybe another 2 hours?\n\nThat would be 4-5 episodes at best. And then what we wait another year just to see what happens next?\n\nI bet they would need to add more scenes, maybe new characters, some world building, just to justify new arcs or filler episodes.\n\nThe only real series worth watching would be OotP.

For example, I love how the castle in Hogwarts Legacy is depicted as slightly more like something one would see in an illustration that really brings out the fantasy aspect, as opposed to the more plain, modern look from the live action films.",

I know we all want to see our favorite scenes, that the movies omitted on screen but here are my reasons for which I don't think a TV show will be as successful as we might hope:\n\n1. The movies, with their goods and bads, are very iconic. Even if the movie uniforms are not canonical to the books, all fan pics use the movie ones as reference. Everyone associates the Hogwarts castle with the one in the movies. Everyone associates the characters with the actors - even if, say, Hermione or Luna were not as pretty Emma or Evana in canon.\n\n2. We already know how the story ends and we already know all the mysteries from the books. Since it's such a popular story, even people who are not in the fandom know more or less the basics of it. The TV show will bring us nothing new in terms of story-telling if it's going to just be another re-telling of the original series. It will struggle to survive on the nostalgia of our generation. But since we are now all grown ups and have other more important things to worry about, I just don't think we'll be able to dedicate enough time to keep it from being cancelled by the executives.\n\n3. Even if it brings something new, the format they decided on will be really difficult to implement. Think the first two movies (and even the third if it didn't exclude the Quidditch cup side story) were pretty faithful to the books and they were able to depict the books in about two hours. Even if OotP added another half hour to its runtime, it would have been pretty faithful as well. So how are you going to stretch the story over say 8 episodes, each with a 40-60 minutes runtime, unless you add new sideplots and side-characters?",
