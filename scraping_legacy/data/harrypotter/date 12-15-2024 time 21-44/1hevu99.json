    "selftext": "I was just thinking how many of Voldemort's Horcruxes were destroyed with the help of basilisk venom, including Tom Riddle's diary, Marvolo Gaunt's ring, Salazar Slytherin's locket, Helga Hufflepuff's cup and Nagini. \n\nIf Tom's memory had not summoned the basilisk to attack Harry in Chamber of Secrets, Voldemort could have potentially returned successfully within that book. Without the basilisk fang, Harry would not have been able to destroy the diary, leaving the Horcrux intact and allowing Voldemort\u2019s plan to unfold.\n\nWithout the basilisk, other methods would have had to be found to destroy the Horcruxes, leading to a vastly different sequence of events and potentially altering the way Voldemort was ultimately defeated.",

Their political battle would be interesting. Tom is as you said charismatic, manipulative, very talented, intelligent (well in some ways), good at sucking up to those in power, admired and ambitious. Slughorns dream. Unfortunately Tom\u2019s downfall was with his arrogance among other things. A lot of the reasons he became Voldemort in the first place are also the reasons he failed",
