But character wise, he was angry pissed which was understandable. I mean, the young man still remembered Cedric's death, had to be tortured by Umbridge, bullied by Draco and Snape, lost his godfather, was losing his mind to voldemort and was ignored by dumbledore. To top it off as usual, no one believed him about voldemort's return and called him a liar. Dumbledore was a jerk for just ignoring him when he needed support. A lot of trauma has happened to him over the years, it's bound to catch up to him at some point. You should be surprised that it didn't happen sooner. He was pretty resilient for 5 years of insanity. Voldemort tries to kill him every year, he almost lost his life, ginny and then he loses cedric and his godfather.",
