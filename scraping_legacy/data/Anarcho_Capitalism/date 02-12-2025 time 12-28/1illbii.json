The best criticism against Trump in regards to eggs was his decision to withdraw from the WHO as there is currently an outbreak of Avian Flu, and it has started infecting humans, though person to person infection hasn't happened yet, it could become a problem. \n\nHowever, the WHO, was like NATO, where the US is disproportionally pulling the weight, and we learned during Covid that communication about diseases is only valuable if the countries are being honest about it, which they weren't. So while it is bad optics due to the timing, I don't think it will have the effect that many people that criticize it think it will be, at least for the US. The WHO mostly benefitted smaller countries, but I'm kind of tired of the US propping up countries, why do we even need an Org to have people share information, people do that anyway when working towards a common goal.",

The larger criticism that conservatives have now is that every time Trump tries to do anything to curb government waste and maybe funnel it back to something useful for Americans, his administration gets blocked by a judge and it holds up everything for weeks or months. Or, a nominee who can go into a department and start getting things done gets held up in the nomination process, for instance, Kash Patel. He has the votes and the Democrats can't stop his confirmation, but decided to hold it for 5 days. That's 5 days he could have been doing proactive stuff in the FBI, but now all he can do is sit and wait.",
