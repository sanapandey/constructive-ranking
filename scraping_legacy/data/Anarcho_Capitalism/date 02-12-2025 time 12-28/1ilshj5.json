The idea is that Trump will not listen to reason or to Canadians\u2014indeed many Canadians think he's a bully, and if he wants Canada, I'm such a few would invite him into the nearest parking lot so he could get a fistful of Canada. So Trump is a lost cause, but Congress might not be. Granted, both Houses have GOP majorities and they are Trump sycophants who fear the ogre, but if some of their voters are hurting because of retaliation against Trump's tariffs, it might have an effect.\n\nPersonally, I oppose retaliatory tariffs\u2014let the free market do the retaliation. Before Trump conned his way into the White House, Canadians sold to Americans Canadian goods for American money; and what did they do with this American money? Probably buy American products. Then Trump puts up tariffs. Presumably the MAGAts will suffer some higher prices but won't get what's happening. They'll blame the Democrats or anyone but their god emperor. Trump could probably punch one of his supporters in the face and he or she would probably say, \"Thank you, Mister President. Can I have another?\"\n\nSo this nonsense will probably continue for a while.\n\nThe true believers suffer higher prices and Canadians not buying as much American goods as they don't have as much American money. Protected American industries might hire more Americans, but as they are not as efficient because with tariffs, inefficiency is rewarded, they will be less inclined to improve.\n\nAlso, products not tariffed might rise. If Canadian steel and aluminum rises by 25% due to tariffs, nothing is stopping American Steel and Aluminum companies from increasing prices by, say, 10% for their own consumers.\n\nMeanwhile in Canada, people are angry, bummed-out, and perhaps despairing. There might even be things like suicides, which Jessy waters might find entertaining (because he's probably a sick fuck who panders to sick fucks).\n\nBut the more rationalist will seek other markets. Canada has been bad at this as Canada has been too Americentric, but perhaps Canada might sell to others perhaps at a discount, to keep the industries going. Just because Canadian steel and aluminum can't compete with American steel and aluminum in the US, doesn't mean that they can't elsewhere.\n\nAmerican imports drop and with it, American exports.\n\nPerhaps Canada might get some good bilateral deals going. EU? UK? Mexico? the rest of Latin America? Argentina maybe? Turkey? Ukraine?\n\nWho knows?\n  \nBut the Canadian government shouldn't punish Canadian consumers for what the US government does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But how I see it, the average Canadian Worker is about as 60% effective/productive as the average American worker.\n\nI'm not sure about that, and particularly if it's by the hour.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Their economy exists with the SOL it does because do the teat of Uncle Sam.\n\nNo it doesn't. Your comment is stupid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And their unproductive nature has finally caused an insane housing shortage as well.\n\nBoth countries have housing issues, likely due to NIMBY.\n\n[some housing prictes in Manitouwadge, Ontario](https://www.remax.ca/on/manitouwadge-real-estate?lang=en&pageNumber=1&priceMin=&priceMax=100000&pricePerSqftMin=&pricePerSqftMax=&priceType=0&sqftMin=&sqftMax=&lotSizeMin=&lotSizeMax=&bedsMin=&bedsMax=&bathsMin=&bathsMax=&featuredListings=&isRemaxListing=false&comingSoon=false&updatedInLastNumDays=&featuredLuxury=false&minImages=&house=false&townhouse=false&condo=false&rental=false&land=false&farm=false&duplex=false&cottage=false&other=false&commercial=false&commercialLease=false&vacantLand=false&hotelResort=false&businessOpportunity=false&rentalsOnly=false&commercialOnly=false&luxuryOnly=false&hasOpenHouse=false&hasVirtualOpenHouse=false&parkingSpacesMin=&parkingSpacesMax=&commercialSqftMin=&commercialSqftMax=&unitsMin=&unitsMax=&storiesMin=&storiesMax=&totalAcresMin=&totalAcresMax=&Agriculture=false&Automotive=false&Construction=false&Grocery=false&Hospitality=false&Hotel=false&Industrial=false&Manufacturing=false&Multi-Family=false&Office=false&Professional=false&Restaurant=false&Retail=false&Service=false&Transportation=false&Warehouse=false)\n\nI think the prices are in Canadian dollars.\n\n[wp:Manitouwadge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitouwadge)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But please explain their \u201creactive\u201d and \u201csurgical\u201d tarrifs.

I'm sure lots of people in other countries would be happy to buy our exports at more affordable prices.\n\n> Do we just live with the tarrifs? \n\nThe only tariffs we have to live with are the ones our own government imposes on us.\n\nYou're trying to portray tariffs as somehow being taxes levied against foreign countries, but that's not a thing that exists. Tariffs are taxes levied against domestic purchasers of imported goods.  They reduce price competition in the local market.\n\nAnd when you impose tariffs on low-level raw materials like steel and aluminum, you're both increasing prices on domestic consumers *and* increasing production costs for domestic businesses that use those materials as inputs.  That includes domestic businesses that are making goods to export!  \n\nPutting tariffs on steel means that any US-based business that makes things out of steel has to raise their prices, including on goods they're exporting even to countries that aren't levying tariffs on those goods!",
