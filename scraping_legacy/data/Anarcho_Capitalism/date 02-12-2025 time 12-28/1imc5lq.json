It is the most smooth brain take that a company would deliberately charge USA higher and other countries less excluding market conditions. \n\nThere's very simple market reasons on why USA pays the most;\n\n\n1. USA has no public system making market share agreements with drug companies.  However you feel about public health care what it does provide is the biggest possible customer on the market who negotiates on a market share level (eg we will give the company who gives us the best price on a certain type of drug 100% market share for 5 years unless compelling data comes out that there is a better substitute). This price is then publicly published which gives the private market a base level price to negotiate from so they also gett a better price.  Usa has comparatively tiny hospital groups negotiating on price which they keep hidden against their competitors. \n\n\n2. Restrictive laws and regulations restricting generics and substitutes meaning there is often no competition for their product so the drug companies can charge whatever they want, I mean what are you going to do instead, not take it and die? \n\nThis system has been put in place by long term lobbying from drug companies and it will likely never change. Lawmakers are happy with the huge lobbying money they get, hospitals and doctors are stoked as they get a cut of the profits and drug companies love selling into the USA more than anything. The only person who gets fucked is you the customer.",

                            "body": "Nearly all government regulation inadvertently encourages inefficient consolidation. In general, regulation imposes high fixed costs but low marginal costs. When two firms merge, their total cost of complying with government regulations therefore falls.\n\nRegulation thus creates an artificial incentive for firms to consolidate. It places larger firms at a competitive advantage because they can spread the higher fixed costs of regulation over a larger quantity of outputs than smaller firms can. The fixed costs of regulatory compliance inhibit entry, grant larger firms a price advantage that grows as the firm grows, and therefore encourage firms to merge with their competitors. The greater the overall regulatory burden, the greater the incentives for inefficient consolidation.\n\nWhat is true of regulation generally is true of health care and health insurance regulation in particular. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u2019s (Obamacare\u2019s) \u201cminimum loss ratio\u201d (MLR) rules, for example, require insurers who sell health insurance to small businesses and consumers to spend no more than 20 percent of premium revenue on administrative expenses and quality-improvement activities. Large-employer plans may spend no more than 15 percent. These and similar regulations encourage consolidation:\n\nThe fixed costs of complying with the[se] \u2026 and other insurance regulations will weigh more heavily on smaller insurers and increase the costs of entry by new insurers.\u2026 The MLR rules could encourage insurers to consolidate to obtain product portfolios more likely to meet the minimum MLR requirements (e.g., from pooling expenses or reducing statistical volatility in MLRs), or simply to achieve additional economies of scale in administration.9\n\nSome regulations both add to the overall burden of government regulation and create specific barriers to entry that increase consolidation in health care markets. Clinician-licensing laws and the attendant scope-of-practice regulations disproportionately hinder the entry of integrated, prepaid group plans like Kaiser Permanente, which compete on price by making fuller use of midlevel clinicians. To enter new markets, such systems must develop new workflows to conform to each state\u2019s different and ever-changing scope-of-practice rules. Insurance-licensing laws and regulation of medical facilities create similar barriers.\n\nSome government regulation appears to exist for the purpose of encouraging inefficient provider consolidation. Thirty-five states require health care providers to obtain a \u201ccertificate of need\u201d (CON)\u2014that is, a permission slip from government\u2014before entering or expanding their presence in a market. Twenty-eight states impose CON requirements on hospitals.10 CON regulation appears to do little other than increase market concentration by blocking entry:\n\nA reasonably large body of evidence suggests that CON has been used to the benefit of existing hospitals. Prices and costs were higher in the presence of CON, investor-owned hospitals were less likely to enter the market, multihospital systems were less likely to be formed, and hospitals were less likely to be managed under for-profit contract.11\n\nNor does CON regulation appear to improve quality.12 The Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice write, \u201cCON programs risk entrenching oligopolists and eroding consumer welfare.\u201d13 Twenty-two states suspended their CON regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic, an implicit acknowledgment that CON regulation reduces access to care.14",

Competition is always better than not. \n\nIt's not all by design of the govt but yes a lot is, and a lot is made worse by govt.  The excessive cost of building and maintaining a hospital continually turns them into cartels. Even if we exclude all costs due to regulation/Govt just the initial costs to build a hospital, procure all the necessary equipment and drugs along with hire all the staff will set you back minimum $50-$100+ millions with years of pay back without making a profit.  Therefore there is immediately typically a very small pool of potential people that can build a hospital which is why you see the same brands over and over. \n\nDue to this its not a very competitive market, a rural town with under 50k people is unlikely to have more than one hospital.  Even many cities there is usually 1-2 hospitals per part of the city that have soft price fixing arrangements.\n\nIt's the same in drugs, when a company invents a new drug with a 20 year patent and a small market there is often zero incentive for a competitor to make a competitor drug so they are able to sell it for what they want, as dictated by market demand. I'm unsure what you think of patents (some consider them regulation, some not) but these contribute more towards price gouging than anything else.\n\nThere's no simple fix for many of this stuff, it's not easy or sensible to just build 5 hospitals in a town of 50k so there's a competitive market. Nor is it easy to just create 5 drugs which all cure a rare illness so there's a competitive market, excluding all regulations it doesn't make sense for the market to make these investments.",

All companies will charge the maximum possible they can get away with given market conditions, this is not unique to Healthcare or the US. The only reason companies reduce prices is because market conditions force them too (meaning their sales would significantly decrease unless they reduce pricing). \n\nThe way US market is setup means companies are not being forced to and a lot of this is to do with govt meddling and regulations which they are getting paid significant sums to implement and keep. I would expect someone in anarcho capitalism to understand and be against this.",

Economics demonstrates that a buyer paying with other people's money taken at gunpoint has less incentive to seek the lowest price than the millions of buyers would negotiate for on an open market. \n\nIf your system worked, then we would see the government buying all shoes for people and getting the best price for them.

Again we need to look at this through a lens of anarcho capitalism and market conditions. \n\nThe opportunity cost of refusing to buy a shoe is close to nothing, you either go somewhere else, don't wear shoes or potentially even make your own.  Due to the above and the relative ease of making shoes (supply) means that shoes are essentially as close as possible to free market conditions. So if a company increases pricing very soon demand will drop to nothing. \n\nThe opportunity cost of drugs is completely different, you likely die, suffer or have long term complications so it creates a more natural monopoly where companies can increase prices without having the same reduction in demand.  You as the consumer have almost no control, you cannot go somewhere else as there is very limited (sometimes only 1) suppliers, you cannot make it yourself due to the huge barriers to entry and you cannot refuse to buy it.\n\nThere is no requirement for this to be a public vs private debate, if the top 20 hospital groups in America came together and negotiated on prices as a group our drug prices would drop significantly. However they never will because the current setup works incredibly well for them, they take a big cut of the drug profits.  This should surely be very obvious, if you were booking a meal at a local restaurant for yourself or with 19 others you're far more likely to be able to secure a set pricing or discount with 20 people rather than 1.  Especially if you let them know you're also eyeing up the restaurant across the road and will be going there instead if they don't offer you a good deal. \n\nLastly sometimes for natural monopolies with very large barriers to entry buying as a country/group makes sense, for example oil. Consumers aren't going to petrol stations and negotiating prices, our Govt is.\n\nThe huge cost of hospitals, inventing drugs backed by regulations and patents has turned many parts of Healthcare into monopolies (especially in USA) which is why companies can charge insane prices and get away with it.",

In general, regulation imposes high fixed costs but low marginal costs. When two firms merge, their total cost of complying with government regulations therefore falls.\n\nRegulation thus creates an artificial incentive for firms to consolidate. It places larger firms at a competitive advantage because they can spread the higher fixed costs of regulation over a larger quantity of outputs than smaller firms can. The fixed costs of regulatory compliance inhibit entry, grant larger firms a price advantage that grows as the firm grows, and therefore encourage firms to merge with their competitors. The greater the overall regulatory burden, the greater the incentives for inefficient consolidation.\n\nWhat is true of regulation generally is true of health care and health insurance regulation in particular. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u2019s (Obamacare\u2019s) \u201cminimum loss ratio\u201d (MLR) rules, for example, require insurers who sell health insurance to small businesses and consumers to spend no more than 20 percent of premium revenue on administrative expenses and quality-improvement activities. Large-employer plans may spend no more than 15 percent. These and similar regulations encourage consolidation:\n\nThe fixed costs of complying with the[se] \u2026 and other insurance regulations will weigh more heavily on smaller insurers and increase the costs of entry by new insurers.\u2026 The MLR rules could encourage insurers to consolidate to obtain product portfolios more likely to meet the minimum MLR requirements (e.g., from pooling expenses or reducing statistical volatility in MLRs), or simply to achieve additional economies of scale in administration.9\n\nSome regulations both add to the overall burden of government regulation and create specific barriers to entry that increase consolidation in health care markets. Clinician-licensing laws and the attendant scope-of-practice regulations disproportionately hinder the entry of integrated, prepaid group plans like Kaiser Permanente, which compete on price by making fuller use of midlevel clinicians. To enter new markets, such systems must develop new workflows to conform to each state\u2019s different and ever-changing scope-of-practice rules. Insurance-licensing laws and regulation of medical facilities create similar barriers.\n\nSome government regulation appears to exist for the purpose of encouraging inefficient provider consolidation. Thirty-five states require health care providers to obtain a \u201ccertificate of need\u201d (CON)\u2014that is, a permission slip from government\u2014before entering or expanding their presence in a market. Twenty-eight states impose CON requirements on hospitals.10 CON regulation appears to do little other than increase market concentration by blocking entry:\n\nA reasonably large body of evidence suggests that CON has been used to the benefit of existing hospitals. Prices and costs were higher in the presence of CON, investor-owned hospitals were less likely to enter the market, multihospital systems were less likely to be formed, and hospitals were less likely to be managed under for-profit contract.11\n\nNor does CON regulation appear to improve quality.12 The Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice write, \u201cCON programs risk entrenching oligopolists and eroding consumer welfare.\u201d13 Twenty-two states suspended their CON regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic, an implicit acknowledgment that CON regulation reduces access to care.14",
