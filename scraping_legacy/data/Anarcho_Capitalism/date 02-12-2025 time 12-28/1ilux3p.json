Their model of \"class cooperation\" was intended as an alternative resolution to the \"class struggle\" that Marxists seek to resolve by the proletariat overthrowing the other classes.  Remember, Fascism originated as a variant form of socialism: it opposes Marxism within that umbrella, but still models the world via premises particular to socialism, e.g. that \"class struggle\" exists as socialist doctrine espouses in the first place, and needs to be solved via forceful action.\n\nSo fascists see their corporatist model as being the mechanism by which workers' interests *are* protected, and interpret striking and unionization as a rejection of that nationalist-corporatist framework and therefore an attack on the unity of the nation-state.  In other words, what they oppose is workers taking independent action, outside the framework of the nation, because to their mind, workers' rights are to be protected *by* the nation-state.\n\nFascism is collectivist statism through-and-through.  Their use of nationalism as an organizing principle, rather than Marxists' class-war model, doesn't make them any less socialist than the Marxist, it just means that they're offering a different approach to socialism.\n\nLibertarians, who reject the entirety of collectivist statism at the ground level, oppose fascism and other forms of socialism for exactly the same reason. But both of those factions take their underlying premises for granted -- they simply *don't comprehend* our understanding of society as an emergent network of freely-associating individuals -- and therefore interpret our opposition to them as supporting the opposing side in their own internecine conflict.  That's why fascists call us commies and commies call us fascists.",

The fascists used the term \"corporatism\" to refer to a model by which the economy would be directed by state-imposed industrial policy, co-opting private industry in pursuit of nationalist aims.  It wasn't the merger of what we today would call \"corporate power\" with the state, implying that the state would be serving the interests of private industry, but rather the subordination of \"corporate power\" to state power.  \n\nWhereas the Marxist socialists simply seized the assets of private industry to run for themselves, the Fascists left private owners *nominally* in place while incrementally making them into de facto agents of the state, so that the state bureaucracy rather than than market-oriented businesspeople were ultimately making all of the important decisions. It was really a different, arguably more subtle approach to socialism than anything else.",

            "body": "\nNational socialism was another position along the same lines. National socialist parties argued that business firms should be made subject to government regulation and coordination in order to keep them from acting against the interests of society as a whole, and that the working classes ought to receive a range of government benefits paid for by taxes on corporate income and the well-to-do. Those points were central to the program of the National Socialist German Workers Party from the time it got that name\u2014it was founded as the German Workers Party, and got the rest of the moniker at the urging of a little man with a Charlie Chaplin mustache who became the party\u2019s leader not long after its founding\u2014and those were the policies that the same party enacted when it took power in Germany in 1933.\n\nIf those policies sound familiar, dear reader, they should. That\u2019s the other reason why next to nobody outside of specialist historical works mentions national socialism by name: the Western nations that defeated national socialism in Germany promptly adopted its core economic policies, the main source of its mass appeal, to forestall any attempt to revive it in the postwar world.   Strictly speaking, in terms of the meaning that the phrase had before the beginning of the Second World War, national socialism is one of the two standard political flavors of political economy nowadays. The other is liberalism, and it\u2019s another irony of history that in the United States, the party that hates the word \u201cliberal\u201d is a picture-perfect example of a liberal party, as that term was understood back in the day.",
