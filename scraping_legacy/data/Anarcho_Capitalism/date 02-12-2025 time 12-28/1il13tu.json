The legislative passes a law, the executive enforces it, and the judicial interprets it.

The Treasury is bound BY LAW to comply with Congress, and cannot act independently of Congress.",

The US dollar is the world reserve currency for oil trading, which is propped up by the military. It truly doesn't matter what the national debt is, as long as diplomacy is maintained to prevent another military power from becoming the world reserve for oil trading.\n\nI don't know what world you're living in that you think fiat currency has value to begin with. It hasn't since we, and pretty much every other country dropped the gold standard. It's a debt based economy, and the world runs on oil. If we keep looking like irrational and volatile fools on the global stage the likelihood of say the Yuan replacing the dollar is significantly greater than if our leaders sit back and do nothing which at least gives doubt about trying anything, but gutting and running internal strife weakens our position. No one wants an arbitrary trading partner it's bad for business.\n\nPeople who are criticizing it are thinking critically about our global appearance and standing.

This let him expose some of the grift quickly with less pushback.  As more grift gets exposed, more people are getting angry over what has been found and taste for rooting out more is expanding.   Even for myself, I suspected a lot of this kind of thing was there but it still makes me angry too see it 'in person' so to speak.  But I suspect the military will be more complicated and more dangerous to tackle.  Beyond that, the rumor mill is that the military is also planned for investigation.",

What makes me concerned are still a few things though -- (1) this being done outside of any sort of Congressional process which will only raise the possibility of judicial review down the line to undo everything -- (2) the fact that USAID has previously gone after Starlink makes me think that this is a personally motivated witchhunt rather than an ideologically-drive attempt to reduce waste, and (3) focusing on all the \"woke\" and \"DEI musical\" stuff, as much of a waste that stuff was for USAID, just puts this right back into a \"culture war\" conversation rather than a \"government spending\" conversation.\n\nHowever bad we might think USAID's \"wasteful spending\" is, I bet there are things in the Bowels of the Pentagon that *nobody* is expecting to find... And I hope that this group \"DOGE\" is going to go after those with the same intensity as they seem to be looking for \"woke musicals\" to expose.\n\nBut somehow I doubt it.

Wanna take 20 years o get this done?  Trump has 4 years, he has to move fast, there's really no choice here.  If he fails, it's not like it can't be tried again using some other method.  And it's already succeeded greatly in that a lot of people heard about all the waste and are pissed and want more.  \n\nI also don't GAF if Musk is mad about Starlink stuff, there will always be some spin that can be made along those lines since the left and right are constantly at war, there will be no agency that Musk or Trump or someone involved never had a beef with in some way.  If we required that not be the case ever, nothing would ever get done. If Musk strokes his big fat revenge ego on this, it doesn't matter that much to me, what matters to me is what is exposed and potentially fixed.  Don't let perfect be the enemy of good or this will never get done, lord knows Trump is not my favorite person even more so than Musk but he's the one willing to try to do this and all the others didn't so I'll go with it.  \n\nAs for the DEI stuff, he needs to cater to his base plus it does show how much DEI has been used for major grift which is important to expose.    Also I have heard that the military is also slated for audit.  But it makes sense to go after the easy stuff with quick results first.  We are only in the first weeks and he's done a lot so to me it's completely unfair to immediately jump to complaining he he hasn't gone after everything there is to fix yet.  Also I am sure his lawyers are advising him as to what is legal, the pres has only certain powers, and there are probably  more limits for some of the other agencies.",
