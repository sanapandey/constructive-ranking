You just said that Free Markets don't work. So if the market was free, then how did car companies \"prevent\" anything? They did so using government. They captured regulatory agencies, local governments, planning commissions - they bribed representatives to vote how they wanted. Which means that the decision was made Congress and local governments. Which by definition means we didn't have a free market in the very area where you disapprove of the outcome. I disapprove of the outcome, too (BTW). Which is why I want a free market. In a free market, the outcome is determined by the availability of resources and the quality of problem solving. When government steps in, the outcome is determined by whoever can buy the most votes. Which system sound like it benefits oil companies and car companies more?  \n  \nI understand if you don't understand my point about pollution, as it isn't commonly discussed outside economic circles. My position is that it should be \"easy\" and viable to sue companies for the pollution they produce - including with class action lawsuits. Lawsuits allow the \"negative externality\" of pollution to get internalized, meaning that the company now has to pay the cost of that harm. This is far more effective in curbing companies to make cost-optimizing decisions to limit pollution (at least compared to using taxes or regulations instead). Regulators and tax agents just get captured by the very groups they are supposed to limit, so those strategies are an uphill battle that we shouldn't expect \"the people\" to win.",

So basically just a journalist. In 2009 obama gave him a post as a \u201cpipeline coordinator\u201d but in reality his role was as a figurehead so obama didnt have to listen to our delegation and had to talk to him instead.\n\nLater had a state deputy commissioner of revenue position.\n\nSince then he gave himself the title \u201coil and gas analyst\u201d \n\nIn short hes analyzed the industry for a long time, but never actually has worked, or been truly involved in any energy projects at all except as an obstructionist and newspaper contact.\n\nHe regularly disparages the pipeline.\n\nHes right the pipeline has serious struggles ahead, but never for the reasons he spouts off and shouts about to the newspapers.\n\nGas balancing issues at the supplier/producer level to deal with market fluctuation is the real issue that glenfarne\u2019s going to eventually encounter.",
