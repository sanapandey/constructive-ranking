Let\u2019s NOT tolerate anarchy and destruction just because globalist billionaire Marxists are funding the riots and funding bailing the criminal rioters out.\n\nKyle Rittenhouse was the hero of the totally undue GF riots. GF did not deserve the umbrage of society for a number of reasons. The narrative that sparked the \u201cSummer of Love\u201d is as real as the sincerity of BLM taking our donations to do fuck all to help the people they claimed to. It\u2019s no different than jailing the Black cop who shot Ashley Babbit(who was breaking the law) for \u201cracial justice\u201d and sentencing him to something absurd for doing his job! But somehow THAT would be \u201csupremacy\u201d but making an example of a cop who did not deserve that for the self-inflicted outcome of a man who didn\u2019t deserve the outrage isn\u2019t \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

For him getting into politics was basically a late stage career change, and he made a lot of mistakes in his first term. He readily admits to this during one of the long form interviews he did (I forgot which one, but he basically said he trusted some bad people. Deep state people. And it bit him in the ass).\n\nSay what you will about his personal character (I don't know the man), but Trump is nothing if not effective, and I think he learned a lot about the slimy nature of wheeling and dealing on Capitol Hill. As opposed to the more objective-based wheeling and dealing of businesspeople.\n\nThis time around he's playing political 4D chess at a high level. And it's fucking over the deep state and the propaganda machine. At least this is what my cautious optimism is leading me to believe.\n\nBut, as with Milei, I can only honestly say: \"We'll see \ud83d\ude0c\" So far these first two weeks have been encouraging.",

It is not a \"solidly blue\" state, it is very much a purple state. This is a great advantage to libertarians because elections are won or lost by very few votes which gives libertarians a lot of leverage in making the r/D's nominate liberty candidates.\n\nThere are currently \\~100 Free Staters in the house of reps, including the house majority leader, and several of them in the Senate.\n\nThe house just the other day passed a bill by a Free Stater Rep which intends to force overturning [Wickard v Filburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn) by legalizing commercial production of machine guns (I believe) and then bringing it to SCOTUS when the feds sue.
