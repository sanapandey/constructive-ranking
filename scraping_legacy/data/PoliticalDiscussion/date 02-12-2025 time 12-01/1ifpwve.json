(2001-09) and the current Trump administration, do you believe Musk, who's got both $15.9 B in contracts and a couple of lawsuits with government agencies, is attempting to pull a Cheney? And if so, do you believe he could succeed?",

    "selftext": "I was thinking about the similarities between the two presidents and the closest person to them, who stand a lot to gain and have undoubtedly are very influential in their decision making.  And I don't think in hindsight, many Americans and members of the Legislative Branch would still be on board for the invasion of Iraq if they knew how it would turn out- particularly regarding the no-bid government contracts with Halliburton to manage the oilfields after Saddam\u2019s regime fell. \n\nSo I\u2019m curious if you believe Musk is attempting to be Cheney 2.0? And if Musk were trying to do something similar to Cheney by exerting influence on the President\u2019s policymaking, do you think the Legislative Branch would be able to prevent it in an effort to avoid a repeat of what happened during the Bush Administration? Why or why not?\n\nIf not, do you believe it is within the realm of possibility that Trump and Musk are instead working in tandem to attempt something akin to state capture? And could that be successful or will the Legislative check \u201ctheir\u201d Executive power and prevent policymaking that seems primarily to benefit Musk and Trump and clearly detrimental for the American people?",

I've gotten sick on multiple occasions and spent months trying to recover because of someone getting sick and deciding they could go out in public with zero precautions, walk into my personal space while knowing they had strep throat, etc. \n\nNot to mention I've been screamed at by strangers on the street on multiple occasions since 2021 (7 that I can count) for wearing a mask while walking my dog. No conversation or anything initiated beforehand, just me walking by not even saying anything, and getting harassed by idiots in the street. MAGA tries to claim \"we only act that way about healthy people, if someone sick needs to wear a mask then fine, just don't force it on us\", ignoring people like me who don't \"look\" sick, yet I'm on long term chemotherapy for autoimmune diseases and still deal with these people's bullshit. \n\nI'm a bit too young to experienced the full brunt of Bush's two terms (I was born in 2003, one of my earliest memories of politics is seeing Obama being elected talked about on the news my parents were watching), but I remember Trump's first term well, and I hoped after how he handled 2020 that I'd never have to deal with it again, yet he seems even worse this time around. Going through two terms of Bush and then two terms of Trump is just awful, I hope our country collectively stops falling for propoganda-driven grifters like them in the near future, but I doubt it. It worsens all of our quality of life everytime, compared to how healthy our middle class was pre-Nixon.",

NPD is inherently more difficult to diagnose because of the ability of those with NPD to mask/manipulate the environment and those around them to avoid anyone that challanges their own internal view of reality. Socially, the term Narcissist, is thrown around too loosely to discredit someone who isn't liked or has opposing values. \n\nVS.\n\nNarcissitic tendencies - character traits that are shared by NPD individuals but in of it self, do not mean the individual has NPD. This can be used socially in a more responsible way. As a way to highlight poor behavior in our day to day social interaction. Eg. An exploitive coworker, who may or may not have npd, but the exploitive nature of this individual is recognized and to be aware of.\n\nAs a medical professional myself, I try to hold myself to this standard, because as nuanced as it is, I personally believe it's the responsible method of communication. In Trump and Elon's case, as I don't know them personally or have had extended direct contact, I can not responsibly state they have NPD.\n\nBut with a preponderance of publicly available information on their behavior and actions, I can responsibly state my opinion that they exhibit Narcissitic tendencies.\n\nFrom my experience, those with and npd and some with Narcissitic tendencies can not function in a situation where others challange their view of reality. The main issue is that they have the complete lack of ability or insight to see reality as anything other then what they believe.\n\n Their reaction is a mixture either\na) push their own narrative as hard as they can because that is the only one that exists\nb) discredit the individual by any means necessary \nc) Go scorched earth and remove themselves from the situation entirely if it's multiple people calling them out\n\n2 people like this can not co-exist or function together for an extended period of time. This environment is ripe for manipulation from an outsider, because both individuals aren't driven by getting results but by needing to be praised and thought of as brilliant/successful/the defacto leader.\n\nYou can not use logic, facts or truth to reason with them.

Cheney stuck to the shadows and took advantage of his position to make money and such, but wasnt nearly as public a figure.  Particularly when 9/11 happened Bush became the figurehead and spokesperson while Cheney pulled the levers in the background.\n\nWhereas Musk constantly invites challenge and petulantly acknowledges every criticism as if a person is in the room with him.  Musk will wear out his welcome.",
