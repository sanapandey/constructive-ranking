People really do not know how the fuck or WHY the fuck our government exists in the first place. \u00a0People seriously don\u2019t understand the concept of keeping mob mentality and brute force away from being the levers of power. Ya know, the fears of our founding fathers? Because they saw that power used first hand and said fuck that. It\u2019s exactly what Trump did on Jan 6th, AND IS EXACTLY WHY THE FOUNDERS WROTE THE FUCKING CONSTITUTION - SO NO ONE COULD USE MOB VIOLENCE TO GET THEIR WAY.\u00a0\nAs others have said, no president has abused the office in the ways Trump has. NOT EVEN CLOSE. Obama did not rule through decrees as people think. Congress was purposefully gridlocked and things still needed to move forward. The dude taught ConLaw so he actually knew where he could use executive action effectively. And he knew that those were not decrees and weee only temporary. He talked ad nauseam about that and needing CONGRESS TO STEP UP.\u00a0\n\nSeriously, don\u2019t post disingenuous questions like this, and then you need to go read The Federalist Papers and get a better understanding of this country\u2019s history before coming to a political discussion.",

None of them, until Trump, have tried to use executive orders to unilaterally abolish federal agencies that were created by Congress in a law. \n\nThere is no precedent for what is happening save for the last time Trump was in office. He is deliberately slamming into checks on presidential authority in hopes they'll give way. Unfortunately for the country, he's being supported by Republicans and a conservative movement that seem content with trading anything in order to advance their agenda, even if that means looking the other way on clearly unconstitutional uses of executive authority.",

Remember when Obama admin asserted its own authority to assassinate US citizens overseas if they were labeled a terrorist? A lot of people on the left called this insane because you are basically saying if you got a guy in there who was willing to act blatantly immorally they could do so much damage.

For us to get to the point where presidentially-approved drone strikes killed Americans, Congress first had to delegate certain authorities for authorizing the use of force outside of defined wars. Then, on top of that the administration had to justify the imminent threat concerns; in the high-profile case of Anwar al-Awlaki, the president ordered a drone strike on someone known to be a senior official in a non-state organization engaging in direct, asymmetric conflict with the United States. You may or may not know this, but cops in the U.S. are empowered to kill citizens in America for far less. \n\nCompare the drone scenario to what is happening now under Trump. Even if you think Obama stretches the letter of the law with his drone policy, the fact remains that Congress passed laws telling the president to go forth and kill these people at your discretion. Congress can not delegate the authority to change laws without its procedural consent. The power to make--and therefore unmake--laws, including constitutional amendments, is only explicitly afforded to Congress. \n\nYou're pointing at things to say they're further up the slippery slope, but we're standing at the bottom of a sheer cliff.",

Because here's the rub: you're describing Congress and the theory of the case underpinning its construction in the constitution. A broad, cross-party--dare I say, bipartisan?--group of political leaders coalescing around a shared goal is how Congress is designed to function.\n\nIn theory, your ask is very simple. But in practice anti-corruption can have a lot of different permutations in how different segments of the public conceive of that idea. \n\nTo me, what is happening in the executive branch right now is a level of corruption that hasn't been seen since the credit mobilier or teapot dome scandals in the 1800s, but to many Americans that disagree with my understanding of corruption and how to fight it, what Trump is doing is anti-corruption. In that way, Congress currently reflects the public--bitterly divided and often confused. \n\nObviously, it would be better if we could all just come together in some other way or inside some other institution, but the problems are not institutional they're social. In many ways, the myriad problems we see in Congress won't be fixed simply by changing the venue or even the people in that venue, the problems are sadly far more fundamental to our body politic.",

It's been made clear that the D leadership prefers trump-style authoritarian tendencies to Bernie style dem-soc tendencies every time.  They secretly funded MAGA campaigns in the same election that they sabotaged the biggest, most energetic grassroots movement from the left in 50 years or more. \n\nAll under the same premise that you're putting forth here... If we can just give them enough rope to hang themselves with, surely the public will come around.  Problem is you're not offering the public what they want / need.  So no, they're not coming around.  They;'ve said twice now they'd prefer this circuis to the alternative milquetoast proposals the mainstream D's are offering. \n\n> Got too liberal too fast\n\nLOL.  This is absolutely insane to hear in 2025.  The thought that democrats have gone \"too left\" when by all measures they have gained almost zero ground for the left in recent memory and have managed to sede MASSIVE ground to the right.  The only time dems have made policy that aligns with liberal-left ideals is when it also has sweets for the corporate elite included.  \n\nWangt healthcare reform?  Great Let's do it!  Oh your plan would eliminate the predatory insurance industry and save several hundreds of billions of dollars?  We can't do that, they'll call us SOCIALISTS!  Instead we have to mandate coverage, do nothing about prices, and mandate the taxpayers pick up the tab!\n\nMeanwhile they still fucking called you socialists.  And worse.  Big pharma and health insurance industries continue to be abusive while raking in massive profits. Life expectancy is dwindling.  AND you have now opened up any health care reform to attack by using the shitty half-measure as an example! \n\nWith all due respect, your take is almost precisely the reason they keep losing and will continue to lose, in my estimation.

We are used to Presidents doing this now and driving public opinion, but that was new then.\n2. Obama in particular pushed things pretty far, and established the precedent Trump is now using, of straight up refusing to enforce laws that Congress passed at his discretion.\n3. Trump is taking this to an extreme that no other President has before. He is just blatantly disregarding law and the Constitution itself in a way that the others didn't. He is also rather objectively acting against the National Security interests of the US in ways the others didn't. Outside of the ridiculous political circus that our media has become, most historians and analysts are quite clear that he is very very dangerous and has been eroding our democracy.
