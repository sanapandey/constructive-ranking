    "selftext": "This means that the main parties which feature would tend be part of the government, by which I mean executive branch's main heads (a cabinet usually), with a significant fraction of the departments and agents (usually >25%), they often give the post of deputy head of government to another party, and they generally pass legislation together. The two parties in question would normally be rivals and they would normally not be part of the government at the same time. The CDU and SPD in Germany is a good example, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael in Ireland, the OeVP and the SPOe in Austria, the Democratic Party and the African National Congress in South Africa, and more. How much should they feature?\n\nIn Germany, it looks like the most likely outcome of the election right now is an SPD, Gruene, and CDU/CSU coalition. A unity government features most of the parties in the legislature, although a few parties may dissent and refuse to be part of it.\n\nOpposition parties do often still exist in the legislature outside of the coalition, and they may be needed to support certain things needing supermajorities like amending the constitution, although sometimes there aren't any members of the legislature to do this.\n\nAnd no RFJ Jr, this isn't anything related to the idea of a uniparty.",

            "body": "As a German I have a few things to say about a few things:\n\nCoalitions are between partys, but they are not necesarilly as different as CDU and SPD/greens right now. For example SPD and greens are pretty similar, with the greens being a little bit more on the left (oversimplified; It depends on the federal state and city and the youth organizations of these partys). Another left party in Germany would be the left party, that could coalate with SPD and greens (not right now, they would get way too less votes, but it has happened on a federal level). Normally these coalitions (SPD/Greens/left or CDU/FDP) work better than CDU/SPD for example.\n\nNow you have to take into account that in the partys there are people on the left and on the right. Many right wingers of the CDU split themselves and went to the AfD (Krah for example) or they built their own irrelevant party (werte union with maasen, a right wing extremist who was the head of the Verfassungsschutz, but this is a whole another story). For example Angela Merkel was rather a social democrat in the CDU and thus critizised Merz who recently flirted with the AfD (she would probably vote SPD right now). So partys can also shift in certain directions. CDU shifted to the right, just like the AfD (because \"normal\", not as radical politicians left, for example Meuten, he is now werte union, petry, Lucke).\n\nI can imagine a situation where the CDU goes into a coalition, just like that: \"In order to secure safety and stability and wealth we will form the first CDU/AfD coalition\", also because they already worked together on a federal level (in thuringia against the minority red/red/green government). I can already see that the green party youth (GJ) might protest against CDU/Green and leave (a part already left in the time of the last coalition) and the youth organization of the SPD (Jusos) could also protest against a CDU/SPD coalition.\n\nTo come back to the main question: I did not like the ex coalition SPD/FDP/greens, I did not like the coalitions of CDU/SPD, because it was 12 years of stagnation, and I dont like FDP/CDU, because I know what they did and because they got a lot worse since then, neoliberalism screwed germany, for example never ask who messed solar industry up, the train system, why there are too less afordable homes.... the list goes on. Besides I dnt like the red/green coalition in the early 2000s, because they were like a CDU/SPD coalition, just as neoliberal and shitty.\n\nSo to wrap it up: Dont cry about you shitty situation, coalitions are not necesarilly a better option. Do your own thing and mabey change something yourself you dont like in politics in joining a party (this is the only nice thing in a more-than-two-party-system, you can look for a party with a low right-left spread (the republicans have nazis and normal neoliberals, I would probably not join them, even if I was a neoliberal, and the democrates are even more heterogenous from my observation). I am part of the left party right now and I hope for a better time with stable 5-15% and a few changes in politics (I would not stop aid to Ukraine), but right now it looks pretty good.\n\nNot to mention the coalitions in saxony and thuringia right now, they are really fucked up because the AfD was so strong that they had to improvise.",

            "body": "I'm somewhat split on the notion, or more accurately how it played out in Canada over the past few years in a three-party environment (probably a bit different in European countries with more parties and alternate vote systems). I'm not really a fan of the NDP's leadership basically subordinating themselves to the Liberals to give them an effective unearned majority in Parliament, but a large part of that is probably me not liking the Trudeau government in general. And irrelevant as it is to the electoral process, the Conservatives *did* win the popular vote total last election, but not the most ridings (the final seat totals being 153 Liberal, 120 Conservative, 24 NDP and 33 Bloc Quebecois...but they're a different complaint altogether). \n\nYes, the NDP aligns with the Liberals ideologically a lot more than the Conservatives, so I realize that coalition or not it wasn't really going to change anything in the end. Which I guess means my complaint is more with the NDP's leadership for officially attaching themselves to the Liberals (and the Bloc for...existing), but there it is. Well, that and the whole issue of what to do with the popular vote in a FPTP Westminster-type parliamentary system, but that's a different kettle of fish entirely.",

The Liberals would have 60% of the seats needed for a majority in this kind of coalition, the NDP roughly 40%. Very different from the 17% of the seats vs 83% of today. And the Liberals could not threaten to turn to the Bloc Quebecois, though the Tories would technically be an option. It would not be realistic to threaten to dissolve parliament as a prime minister as much as they could now.",

Coalitions are not the result of a \"should\"; they are the result of purely practical considerations where no party has a majority, or where several small parties reach an agreement to form an alliance to block a larger party with political goals more inimical to them than they are to each other.  There's no \"should\"; just pragmatism.",

In Germany's case specifically, having the SPD and CDU/CSU split most cabinet positions while giving the Greens 2-3 strategic ministries (like Environment & Economy) would maintain both stability and accountability. The key is establishing clear policy agreements upfront and having a robust conflict resolution mechanism - the 2005-2009 grand coalition showed this can work even between traditional rivals. Just avoid the temptation to water down controversial but necessary reforms just to maintain consensus.",
