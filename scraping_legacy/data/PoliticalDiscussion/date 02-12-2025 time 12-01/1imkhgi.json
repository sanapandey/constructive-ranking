    "selftext": "We are three weeks into the Trump administration and there are already claims of potential constitutional crises on the horizon.  The first has been the Trump administration essentially impounding congressional approved funds.  While the executive branch gets some amount of discretion, the legislative branch is primarily the one who picks and chooses who and what money is spent on.  The second has been the Trump administration  dissolving and threatening to elimination various agencies.  These include USAID, DoEd, and CFPB, among others.  These agencies are codified by law by Congress.  The third, and the actual constitutional crisis, is the trump administrations defiance of the courts.  Discussion of disregarding court orders originally started with Bannon.  This idea has recently been vocalized by both Vance and Musk.  Today a judge has reasserted his court order for Trump to release funds, which this administration currently has not been following.\n\nThe first question, does any of this matter? Sure, this will clearly not poll well but is it actual salient or important to voters?  Average voters have shown to have both a large tolerance of trumps breaking of laws and norms and a very poor view of our current system.  Voters voted for Trump despite the explicit claims that Trump will put the constitution of this country at risk.  They either don\u2019t believe trump is actually a threat or believe that the guardrails will always hold.  But Americans love America and a constitutional crisis hits at the core of our politics.  Will voters only care if it affects them personally?  Will Trump be rewarded for breaking barriers to achieve the goals that he says voters sent him to the White House to achieve?  What can democrats do to gain support besides either falling back on \u201cTrump is killing democracy\u201d or defending very unpopular institutions?",

Americans are sick of a dysfunctional congress who has been deadlocked for decades, unable to meaningfully address any of the glaring problems that are blatantly obvious to all.\n\nTrump may not be solving any of those problems, at all, but he is \\*doing things\\* which may feel to lower information voters to be moving in the right direction. Most people don't know enough about government to know the difference between \"his methods are rough but he's getting things done\" and \"he's consolidating power and dissolving our government\".",

                    "body": "Well they voted for a convicted felon who had other outstanding felony indictments for illegally overturning an election results, inciting an insurrection and refusing to turn over classified materials and was tied closely with Project2025 and its views on reimagining the Constitution and executive branch power, so there's already an indication many wanted a dictator who doesn't follow the law. It revolves around a vague goal to \"get things done\" on the notion that our federal debt problem is all \"wasteful spending\" only and not decades of tax cuts weighted towards the wealthy, something media has been pushing for a long time.\n\nThe other thing they have going for them is the amount of press Doge is getting. Trumpian beliefs are that any news is good news. Doge probably already has more press coverage in a few weeks than the Government Accountability Office gets in 10 years, an office that saves us around [$60-70 billion a year](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-900570) through actual auditing activities, and one that follows the law, whose conflicts of interest are miniscule in comparison to Musk and Trump and has transparency.\n\nI do think there's a small portion of swing Trump voters who didn't vote for this, thought Project2025 was just scare tactics. If so, it will probably take more time to figure out what's going on, when the consequences become more clear, and admitting they were wrong isn't going to come easy.",

I guess I'm referring to newer swing voters who were duped into believing Biden was responsible for globally-induced inflation (big assist from the media in perpetuating that) and Trump would lower grocery pries and rent. That won't happen. They aren't necessarily all in on Project 2025 garbage or big Musk fans.",

Also, you are dealing with people who, generally (There are stats to back this up) lack critical thinking skills. It's been a targeted effort for decades by the right wing media and conservatives. Combine that with political churches telling them that the left are evil sinners and it's impossible to deprogram these people. Trying to reach the majority of Trump voters is a lost cause and waste of energy. 35% of the adults in the country are simply  too far gone. Some may wake up, but targeting the disengaged voters and bridging the gap between centrist dems and the far left is a far far better use of time and effort. The right wing understanding of the economy and geopolitics is akin to \"Paper straws, bad\" and \"Trans are bad\" They don't understand the nuance of government funding or have much knowledge of the history of fascist regimes through history. \n\nI know this comes off as condescending and the typical liberal assuming they are smarter (Again facts show we are more educated across the board). But sometimes recognizing reality for what it is, is the best way forward. 35% of this country are irredeemable cultist who will not change. 34% are normal people who are engaged and care and 31% can be motivated, if communicated to properly. \n\nI also want to give hope to people. I am a therapist. I would say 8/10 of my clients are worried about what is going on (Some admitted non voters). They just fear speaking out currently. Some also fear they are gaslighting themselves. I remind them and I will remind people on here. If you are concerned that everything is bad, you are not alone and you are NOT gaslighting yourself. People on the right will accuse you of being hyperbolic. You are not. They are the ones gaslighting you. Protect your peace, find ways to help out. Write to your legislators regularly. We WILL overcome these fascists.",

And even if government is working for you now, once you get rid of all the guardrails, people will consolidate power, and all of us citizens are going to be an afterthought.\n\nI hope I'm wrong.

I mean, yes the border is closed (and it was closed during parts of last year as well).  As I hear it, most of the roundups have yet to take place.  None of those impacts are being felt yet.  We have yet to see widespread street level enforcement across the country with the potential for military involvement, the loss of goods and services that come from such a sudden drop in migrant labor or the fallout from many of those people ending up in a camp somewhere.

Trump tried his damndest to convict Hillary of something, anything, and couldn't.  In 2017 they called a grand jury and failed to get anything through to the prosecution phase.  \n\nAll it takes is 1 juror, one snippet of evidence, one judge to overturn an unjust conviction.  And this is 100x more true if a person has the money to hire a competent attorney.  Exonerees (or failed exonerees) are almost always \"probably guilty\" in the first place even when they're ultimately innocent.",

The only strong distinction between the two sets of voters, was that Trump voters favored a \"strong\" leader. They shared a taste for authority. Which explains why groups like police unions, trade unions and the military are largely supportive of Trump, regardless of his crimes. This preference for a strong authority, or figure invested with authority, also explains why so many religious groups are drawn to Donald Trump, regardless of how hypocritical that looks to outsiders.",

It's the same way the media got people thinking an economy where wage growth surpassed inflation and 17 million+ jobs were added was actually really bad for everyone, and inflation falling to under 3% was bad because prices hadn't returned to 2020 levels (same situation during Reagan's first term but he won by 18%). So keep reminding people of that farce.\n\nThat said, I don't think it hurts to have federal workers speak out. So many have been bombarded with dehumanizing rhetoric on the federal government and its workers, so reminding people that they are normal people like them and civil servants would do more good than harm.",

Maybe some nationwide push to do that. Been reading a book called The Chaos Machine that covers how social media, youtube, news feeds just keep thickening echo chambers, and it's much worse on the right than the left. Now we have influencers that contribute to all that and social media companies giving of any pretense of putting brakes on their core business models.

We are about as far away from an election as we can be.

Obama and the dems were in congress pushing for a tax on the 1% which led to a government shutdown. Obama was traveling the country trying a sales pitch to tax the 1%. And the OWS protestors rejected Obama talking at ows events, rejected voting for the dems, rejected supporting any particular piece of legislation, rejected running their own OWS candidates, rejected having an OWS leader or an OWS set of stated goals, and achieved literally nothing aside from hurting the dems chances of taxing the 1%.... then they refused to vote for the even more progressive Hillary because she didn't *earn* their vote.\n\nLots of effort and nothing to show for it. I mean, from the start they should have been occupying the legislature that passes laws, not wallstreet.\n\nThe movement from the right a few years earlier, the tea party, had far less popular support. They had clear goals from the start, ran tea party candidates and primaried others that didn't fit their goals. They ended up taking about 1/3 of the GOP and completely shifted politics in the country.\n\nAnd then back to the woke progressives we had two more attempts since OWS for them to learn from the past so they did .... BLM .... which is fundamentally racist and easy to reject by the masses. They rejected the support of white people (the majority of americans), and specifically fought against BLMT (black lives matter too) or ALM (all lives matter), effectively hamstringing their goals because the leadership of BLM was a black supremacist that wanted to create a black only ethnostate... and then they had DEFUND ..... which is just a terrible idea supported by like 20% of the population and was never going to get anywhere. In the few cities that tried it, it caused a predictable disaster that needed to be rolled back.\n\nOther woke movements have been the push to censorship in schools/media (cancelling), DEI, extended trans rights, critical theory, micro-aggression, reparative justice (ie smashing statues of people that were racist in the 1700s, reparations, race base rights), reverse racism. Most of which have backfired, many of which have very low support.\n\nThe last 15 years of woke progressiveness have succeeded in nothing. Or worse.\n\nObama era left/progressives though:\n\n- gay marriage, repeal dadt, sensible/popular trans rights\n- decrim weed, reduced sentences for other drugs\n- student loan reform\n- worker protections\n- climate deals, clean power act",

When supply chains contracted at the height of the pandemic, computer chips became increasingly hard to source, because the great majority of them are made in Taiwan (not China), and factories had slowed down at the same time shipping was being strangled. When even the military was having trouble getting access to semi conductors, the Biden administration rightly moved to invest in domestic chip manufacturing to assure American access to that vital technology. \n\nThey should have also done the same with PPE and drugs.",

With the exception of 2001 (9/11) when it bumped up to 72%. Approval occasionally bumped up to the low 40s as well.   \n  \nThis tells me that it's not that this congress is particularly disliked, it's that the activity of congress in itself is tedious, full of compromise, and difficult for people to appreciate. Congress gets a bad rap, rarely do people pay attention to its progress, but folks always hear about its dysfunction. I think term limits would help, but I can't fathom congress adopting its own term limits. Also, individuals prodding their representatives helps, that's the way it's supposed to work, but most folks don't have the time or care. \n\n[A Look at Congressional Approval Ratings Over the Years (quorum.us)](https://www.quorum.us/data-driven-insights/congressional-approval-ratings-over-time/)",

My sort of philosophical framing here is that it simply never enumerated very many positive rights: It's not a 'right to health,' it's a 'right to pursue health'.^* There are some positive rights in there (the post office), but broadly speaking I think it would be hard to argue that the constitution is being interpreted as intended in the late 1700's. There was a good reason for it -- back then, these things were surely harder to supply. But modern expectations have changed, even if people like to pretend they haven't\n\nI'm not generally in favor of radical overhauls (except maybe with our healthcare system), so I guess I support doing these things by means of amendment. I think a realistic path forward might be something along the lines of that inter-state popular vote compact but for RCV to dissolve the much-maligned two party system, and then hopefully enough political goodwill to push for real constitutional amendments. It really does seem to me that the current system is a little bit too vibes-based, and to be completely honest, I'm surprised the norms did not totally dissolve sooner.^**\n\n^* There are those who claim that they do not like government healthcare, but my understanding is that the ACA ended up pretty popular, and as per Krugman's substack our healthcare is basically provided by means of taxes anyway (just in a convoluted and inefficient way).\n\n^** BTW, what I am suggesting here is explicitly not the cure to fascism/similarly flavored beliefs -- Western Europe has made that much clear. These are sort of an orthogonal axis. My suspicion is that the problems I'm recommending a fix to would have reduced, but not eliminated support for Trump.",

We are already restructuring work between plants, and we haven't hired anyone new in a year. Last week, they demoted half of the production leads. We have fewer people than we had after two rounds of layoffs during 2020. Even the Trump supporters at my work are concerned with prices. The only thing that keeps them positive is thinking ICE is coming to deport anyone with a foreign accent (ignoring they are all here legally and some even have their citizenship), so we will get more hours. If blue-collar workers think they will come out ahead, well, they better hope all of those social safety nets aren't destroyed before they get their pink slips.",

I realized when the supposedly \"well informed\" say that we need to \"protect democracy\", it is really code for \"we need to vote blue no matter who to maintain our dysfunctional bureaucracy\".

The reality is: the senate is not doing that; the president and his administration are doing that and violating the Constitution. Impoundment violates Article 1 of the Constitution. If this administration is willing to violate the very first Article, what else will they violate? What happens when YOUR rights are infringed on, and the courts attempting to safeguard those rights are ignored because this administration is above the law? There is no dysfunctional bureaucracy. There is no cathedral. There is no deep state. There is a civil service and judiciary that is actively keeping this country from turning into a de-Ba'athified Iraq circa 2003. When this states ability to respond to a crisis, whether it be war, natural disaster, pandemic, or economic shock, is destroyed because it was standing in the way of dismantling our Constitution, I sincerely hope you are ready to self-rescue and ride out what is coming.",

Because of my interest in art history I've studied Italian history during the Renaissance and Baroque periods.   These and the entire early premodern period were utterly chaotic, filled with warfare, religious conflict, technological change, geopolitical conflict, clashing ideologies, and plenty of narcissistic leaders.    And it was all before The Enlightenment put the idea in people's heads that you were due any \"rights\".\n\nYet somehow civilization, art, science, and scholarship all advanced.  Many people died pointlessly, and sackings and brigandry abounded. Yet many other people learned to keep their heads down, be quick on their feet while laws and regimes changed, and kept their eyes on the prize.  The period is **filled** with stories of individuals who did well at their goals, be it art, scholarship, or business.   So while we can shed a tear for the old America gone by,  we can adapt to this new world and still keep moving forward, at least in our community or personally.     \n\nAnd those are what count anyway - I can trace my family and my art community back for centuries and many long-gone nations.   Nations come and go.  Family and art transcend them.",

Prior to the election, his net worth was approximately $285.6 billion. Following the election, it surged by about $170 billion, reaching $455 billion, largely due to a substantial rise in Tesla's stock value. \n\nIn the 2024 election cycle, Musk was the largest individual political donor, contributing at least $277 million to support Donald Trump and allied Republicans. This support included significant donations to America PAC, a super PAC he founded to back Trump's campaign. \n\nFollowing Trump's victory, Musk was appointed to co-lead the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, an advisory body aimed at reducing federal spending. \n\nWhile Tesla's stock had been performing well prior to the election, the post-election surge contributed significantly to Musk's increased wealth. The combination of substantial political contributions, a key advisory role in the new administration, and a notable increase in net worth suggests a correlation between Musk's political involvement and his financial gains.\n\nIn summary, Musk's nearly $300 million investment in the election was followed by a $170 billion increase in his net worth and a prominent position in the government, indicating a strong connection between his political activities and financial success.\n\nHere are the sources with direct links for reference:\n\nElon Musk\u2019s Net Worth Surge Post-Election\nhttps://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/elon-musk-net-worth-trump-b2665395.html\n\nMusk's $277 Million Contribution to Trump and Republicans\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-277-million-trump-republican-candidates-donations/\n\nAmerica PAC - Musk\u2019s Political Fundraising Effort\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_PAC\n\nMusk Appointed to Trump\u2019s Government Efficiency Department\nhttps://apnews.com/article/349e66f50b2cd08f6bcebed56f941a3e\n\nThese links provide direct information on Musk's political spending, Tesla's stock surge, and his role in the Trump administration.\n\nMusk\u2019s fortune didn\u2019t just wander up a mountain\u2014it sprinted there right after he spent millions helping a friendly face into power. Sure, correlation isn\u2019t causation if you\u2019re squinting hard enough. But let\u2019s not pretend billionaires toss campaign cash around like confetti for fun. When a man invests close to $300 million and gains nearly two hundred billion soon after, it\u2019s not an accidental windfall. \n\nHow long are we going to watch how these \u201ccoincidences\u201d always seem to tip the scales in favor of those who already own the seesaw?\n\nI repeat what I said... It will take someone working for an $80k salary 2.5 million years to collect 200 billion dollars.\n\nThat kind of wealth flat out, shouldn't exist. Fuck Musk.",

Americans love the idea, sure, but do Americans love a concrete understanding of America that they can rally around and materially defend? It definitely looks like there are sufficiently split understandings of what America is that people with different political views barely can agree on what \"loving America\" looks like, which means that it's not going to be a concrete call for action. People can see that things are bad and wildly disagree on what needs to be done to get them into a better state, and especially be subject to propaganda that burning it all down will somehow make their lives better and restore an ideal America.\n\nThere's plenty of chatter about people looking at the future and warning about fascism circa WWII, but I think this one landed pretty squarely: \n\n>But when fascism comes it will not be in the form of an anti-American movement or pro-Hitler bund, practicing disloyalty. Nor will it come in the form of a crusade against war. It will appear rather in the luminous robes of flaming patriotism; it will take some genuinely indigenous shape and color, and it will spread only because its leaders, who are not yet visible, will know how to locate the great springs of public opinion and desire and the streams of thought that flow from them and will know how to attract to their banners leaders who can command the support of the controlling minorities in American public life. The danger lies not so much in the would-be Fuhrers who may arise, but in the presence in our midst of certainly deeply running currents of hope and appetite and opinion. The war upon fascism must be begun there.\n\n- John T Flynn (who while being kind of a conspiracy theorist was very concerned about populism of the time and honestly would probably have all sorts of nauseous reactions to the modern state of government)",

In CBO\u2019s projections, growing budget deficits boost federal debt dramatically over the next three decades. Although long-term projections are highly uncertain, the aging of the population generally and the growth in per capita spending on health care would almost certainly boost federal outlays as a percentage of GDP after 2030\u00a0if current laws generally remained in place. Outlays would rise even more because of markedly higher interest costs, driven by projected increases in federal borrowing. Federal revenues also would continue to increase relative to GDP, but they would not keep pace with outlays. As a result, by 2050, debt is projected to reach 180\u00a0percent of GDP\u2014far higher than any percentage previously recorded in the United States.",

They wanted the guy to win who promised to do it all.\n\nBased on the UK experience with Brexit, another minimal majority vote for something openly a bad idea, let me tell you what happens.\n\nAt first, the people who voted for the bad idea will defend it. Give it time, it will work out.\n\nThen, if it's a total shit show, they will simply stop defending it. They won't argue against it, but they just won't vocalise support. If they do, it will be along the lines of \"it was a good idea but the politicians didn't do it well\" or \"it's X's fault it didn't work\" where X is their chosen nemesis.\n\nThen, eventually, what will happen is most people will claim something like \"I get where they were coming from. I didn't vote for him of course, but I get why people did\".\n\nWhen there was polling before the invasion of Iraq in the UK, the majority of the public supported it. Ten years later, the majority of people claimed they never supported it ten years ago. Not that they did but they were mislead or whatever, they literally say they never thought it was a good idea.\n\nI think if they did a poll next year in the UK they'd find the same with Brexit. 52% of the public voted for it, but suddenly everyone will claim they never did.\n\nI think Trump will be a disaster in slow motion that can't be stopped, and in ten years time the American public will all claim they never voted for him.\n\nWhich is why with the problems western democracies face, the problem often isn't the systems per se, it's the people doing the voting. If they don't act sensibly no system works.",

Days later, the Coalition refined their message to say that no front-line public service jobs would be affected, just the back-office support roles. My thinking? There is a balance to every system. Cut the back-office support to the front-line staff will mean the more harried the front-line staff will be as answers and support will take longer to come forth.

The real question is whether his actions shake up the status quo enough to make the elites uncomfortable.\n\nVoters will care if it affects them personally, but only if it impacts their finances or daily life. Historically, scandals like Watergate mattered because they exposed criminal behavior that embarrassed the elites.

Many already feel the system is rigged, so elite infighting over norms doesn\u2019t make a difference.\n\nTrump will most likely be rewarded. His base views his challenge to the system as a sign of strength, not corruption. Leaders who go against the system tend to gain popularity, unless they harm the system. If Trump\u2019s actions lead to economic instability or unrest, the elites might turn on him.

Thus, after having seen the results, I am not in opposition to undermining congressional authority to get things done. Because this rapid pace that his administration is moving at is something that I hadn\u2019t even conceived of as being possible. The process of going through days, weeks, months, or years of hearings and meetings and votes for the most minute of changes of policy enactments, is tedious. Not only does the system appear to be designed for deadlock, but the makeup of Congress itself is full of individual I couldn\u2019t care less for, so seeing their authority undermined doesn\u2019t bother me at all. \n\nWith that being said, I am more than aware of the fact that he\u2019s moving close to autocracy, and subverting the checks and balances specifically designed to prevent an autocratic president in order to dissolve government structures he perceives as inefficient, corrupt, or oppositional. But after observing the geopolitical stage, specifically china, I was already in favor of reduced checks and balances for a more efficiently operating government anyway. We simply cannot compete with rival potential global superpowers if our internal political systems are in a constantly deadlocked state of civil war in which both sides pull every card to prevent the other from achieving its objectives. It won\u2019t work while the CCP is building artificial suns and laser ignited fusion energy centers, while working in collective unison towards constant and unyielding progression. \n\nSo while I would agree this constitutes the labeling of a constitutional crisis, and empathize with the sentiment that both democrats and republicans should be alarmed by these developments, I am not alarmed and am rather in support. I think our system of checks and balances should be dissolved and executive branch power should be increasingly consolidated.",
