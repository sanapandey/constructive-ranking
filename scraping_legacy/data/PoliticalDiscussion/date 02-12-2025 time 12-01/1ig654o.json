    "selftext": "Traditional protests against government policies often struggle to create immediate change, especially when leaders are insulated from public pressure. However, targeting major corporations\u2026 particularly those owned by powerful individuals with political influence\u2026could be a more effective strategy.\n\nFor example, if mass protests were organized to disrupt Tesla\u2019s sales, could that force these billionaires to push for certain policy changes? Many argue that economic pressure is the only thing that truly influences those in power.\n\nWould this approach work better than traditional demonstrations? Have there been historical examples of corporate-targeted protests leading to major political or social shifts?\n\nLet\u2019s discuss.",

Just marching in the street does nothing but put pressure on local police and inconvenience your neighbors. If you were to, say, direct your protest at Tesla, or at Scott Bessent's investment firm office in a way that was legal but still made him uncomfortable, you're much more likely to get something out of it. \n\nDon't protest the institution, protest the people behind them. Find ways to make them specifically uncomfortable.",

Power creates change. \n\nBoycotts are notoriously unsuccessful. Often, if a company is singled out for a boycott because of some position, supporters of that position will increase their purchases to more than make up the difference. And often, most of the boycotters don\u2019t maintain their boycott permanently. \n\nThe other thing is that the boycotts can only be effective if they\u2019re done by people who are already making purchases with that company. A boycott of Lamborghini by billions of people has no effect. \n\nRecently, boycotts of Bud Light and Target were successful, because they were done by people who had significant purchasing power and were already patronizing those businesses, and the opposition group had far less purchasing power or didn\u2019t patronize those businesses. \n\nBasically, it only works if it\u2019s sincere.
