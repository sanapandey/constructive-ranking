    "selftext": "There was a supreme court decision in Norway years ago over wind turbines and a group of Sami people had sued over this. And yes, Norway has indigenous people. https://www.jurist.org/news/2024/03/norway-ends-dispute-with-sami-people-over-construction-of-wind-farm-on-indigenous-land/. The Sami actually have a pan-Norwegian parliament of their own with a vote for every Sami. \n\nAnd if they should have a veto, how far should it extend? Who has the ability to invoke it (EG using eminent domain is normally a power available to the public, but could the veto be issued by only an entire nation of indigenous people or could it be held by individuals too?). Canada got in a big fight for a long time with a pipeline project in British Columbia between elected chiefs and hereditary ones (hereditary isn't technically de jure, they do have to be acclaimed), a group called the Wetsuwetan. \n\nI am assuming for this purpose that this is a project bigger than a single indigenous group. Not an instance of something like a nation deciding to build a road between a couple of villages on their reserve, I'm thinking something like someone building a hydroelectric dam on the Snake River or the Yukon.",

However, we also need to consider that many of the places that are significant to an indigenous culture\u2019s survival are no longer under their direct control.  We need to take the effects those projects may have on places into consideration.  \n\nAn example would be Devils Tower National Monument in the US.  The tower formation plays a massive role in Midwest indigenous cultural practice, history, and identity.  A project that defaces the tower, inadvertently restricts access, or blocks view of it may have a detrimental effect on a culture and indigenous spiritual practice that relies on the tower being just the way it is now.  An egregious project could erase the cultural value of sacred place to an indigenous culture that still exists.  \n\nIn western cultures, religious buildings can be reconstructed, indigenous cultures generally rely on the sacredness of place in nature, not on large, human constructed cathedrals or synagogues.  A building can be rebuilt in a new location (generally speaking), nature cannot.\n\nThe National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and other laws require that government projects take potential impacts on large and small indigenous resources into consideration when making decisions about federal projects.  It doesn\u2019t mean that an opinion from an indigenous tribe must be adhered to, but oftentimes amicable solutions and compromises can be found.  It never hurts to talk and find out what is important to a culture, and it\u2019s the law.  I say this as someone who has spent their entire career working with indigenous groups as part of the NHPA compliance process.\n\nThey were here first, and their opinion should carry weight (and that opinion does under law).  A lot of lands were also theirs by treaty until the US went back on its own treaties and violated them.  Many projects occur on those lands that they have claim to via treaty and should be reservation, but aren\u2019t under their control either.\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated situation in which as you\u2019ve said, to the victor go the spoils.  However, in the US at least we also must recognize that we\u2019ve lied about treaties (that are supposed to carry the same weight as constitutional law), taken land illegally outside of armed conflict from tribes, and we are supposed to be a nation of laws that adhere to treaties and law.  The least we can do is follow the law and give indigenous cultures the weight of opinion due them through the legal environmental and cultural compliance processes.",

            "body": "The limits of sovereignty is a tricky issue.\n\nMost \"enlightened' thinkers would basically agree that Native American Reservations are sovereign territory and that any project built on reservation land requires the consent of the tribe. There are weird cases like Oklahoma where the reservations technically exist but were essentially colonized so its more difficult there but in most cases its not. There has also long been legal disputes about how much power do reservations have in controlling the private property of native Americans. The modern consensus generally upholds tribal sovereignty over the private property rights of Native American citizens there is some good-faith and bad-faith critique of that but it's probably the right call.\n\nWhere it gets tricky is the limits of what might be called \"extended sovereignty.\" When it comes to projects this can usually be boiled down into two issues\n\n1. Does tribal sovereignty allow tribes to prevent projects that has an impact on their land despite not being located on their land. E.g Dams flooding their land, pipelines which have the potential to leak on their land, wind farms that might affect their view of the sea or impact their fishing grounds in tribal waters despite being farther off shore\n2. Does tribal sovereignty extend outside of the reservation to \"stolen land\" particularly sacred stolen land to prevent further projects.\n\nMy view would be in case 1 tribal nations should have the same rights that  states e.g Virginia do. If a state would have standing to prevent the project than reservations should as well. If they would not then reservations should not either. I could see some cases like flooding where it could be argued regardless that, that constitutes a violation of sovereignty but I am less inclined to see pollution in the same light. \n\nMy view in case 2 is that while the US government should feel free to negotiate with tribes and both native and non-native citizens should get a say about these concerns to minimize past harms they have no obligation not to build a project on non-native land that does not have direct property harms to existing reservations",
