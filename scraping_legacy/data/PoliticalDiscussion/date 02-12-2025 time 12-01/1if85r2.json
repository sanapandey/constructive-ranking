    "selftext": "What can the U.S. and other NATO countries do to make the alliance more united and stronger? Many politicians from various NATO countries criticize the alliance, arguing that some member countries bear more responsibility than others and that NATO\u2019s role has become less relevant since the Cold War. For example, Trump criticizes NATO for placing a disproportionate financial burden on the U.S., claiming that many member states fail to meet their defense spending commitments. How can NATO countries work together to address these criticisms? Do you believe NATO is less relevant today than it was in the 20th century? What steps should be taken to strengthen the alliance?",

The economic sanctions are about to fall, Europe is not as united as it should be.\n\nWe need to invest more in our military, and to do that, we need to strengthen our economic bonds.  Military and economic alliances have often gone hand in hand in the past.\n\nMore investments in military hardware to counter Russia and China, more joint training to better our troops synergy.  We must learn to fight more as one than a bunch a separate allies.  Sharing information, using similar equipment so we can resupply one another, increasing industrial output, etc.\n\n  \nThe US has become a very aggressive nation, similar to Russia, and nearly half the population love the direction their country is taking toward fascism.\n\n  \nUS will be out of the international trade circuits and will be out of NATO within 2 years.  It is something we have to learn to live with.  \n\n\n\nWe relied way too much on the US for military firepower and handled auxiliary tasks, it's time to wake up.  The way it's going, there is going to be a surplus military hardware sale soon as the US goes broke anyway.",

France is certainly seeing the opportunity from Trump\u2019s continued antagonizing of traditional U.S. allies when it offered the deployment of EU troops to Greenland as a show of strength against Trump.\n\nI don\u2019t think NATO is any less relevant today, but it\u2019s unfortunate that the risk of it tearing apart exists due to the current administration\u2019s actions. The \u201cdisproportionate financial burden\u201d is definitely overblown by politicians seeking to depict NATO as a waste of time and money. Only 8 countries remain below the 2% expenditure level but they\u2019re all increasing closer to that requirement as of 2024. Not many people talk about the 20% equipment expenditure requirement where only two members have yet to reach that guideline but are inching closer to that as well. As it pertains to direct funding, Germany pays the same amount into NATO as the United States does.\n\nFor Europe (and especially France), this presents as the time to push away reliance on the U.S. and towards strengthening common defense under the EU.",

Europe cannot rely on swing voters in Michigan to bail them out every four years. \n\n\"Why couldn\u2019t the European Union accomplish this goal now?\"\nThis would maintain the exact same primary purpose of NATO. Replacing the US entirely would be a difficult shift of burden. But still based on the principle of collective defense.\n\nNATO is still the framework for collective defense though. NATO has military integration and joint exercises, not the EU. The second largest military expenditures in Europe are from the UK, who are not even a part of the EU. The EU is for now, not a military alliance, but an economic alliance. \n\nIt is perfectly reasonable that the burden shifts towards Europe. But it is also in interests of both Europe and the US to maintain NATO. Whether the US likes it or not, they have massive interests on the continent. Both economic and political. Without European allies, all US efforts globally become more complicated. \n\nNATOs collective defense article has also only been triggered once, to support the US after 9/11 in Afghanistan. If the US-Europe relationship is a neutral one, instead of being close allies, US foreign policy objectives becomes more difficult. An example would be american efforts to contain China, which becomes way more complicated if the US cannot rely on the Europeans anymore.",

Europe is not really keeping pace economically.\n\nThe center of the world is moving towards Asia.\n\nThe opprotunity areas for the US are more there and Latin America.\n\n> NATOs collective defense article has also only been triggered once, to support the US after 9/11 in Afghanistan. \n\nThis result in some support from some allies, but the level of that support varied quite a bit.\n\nThe US is 55% of the GDP of the NATO alliance. The rest of the NATO alliance contributed far less than 45% of the cost and support of the Afghan war.\n\nThat is not to detract from those that went above and beyond (UK, Canada notably) but as a whole mainlaned Europe continues to not contribute equally relative to its ability and obligation.\n\n> Without European allies, all US efforts globally become more complicated.\n\nWhy? The combined EU is responsible for about as much global trade with the US as Canada or Mexico are individually. \n\nAsia - Pacific accounts for quite a bit more these days.\n\n> US foreign policy objectives becomes more difficult\n\nWhy do you believe that? What do you think US foreign policy objectives are? I think they can be categorized as the following:\n\n* Contain Chinese influence, maintain technological superiority\n* Prevevent migrant and smuggling flows from central and south america, though both enforcement and investment in partners in those countries\n* Support high opprotunity largely in the Pacific, in service of the frist goal. Tiawan, South Korea, Japan, the Philipenes, Singapore.\n* Similar comment for democracies and countries moving *in the right direction* as it relates to global trade (shipping lanes, energy, etc). This would be inclusive of Israel, support of the UAE / Qatar / Saudi slow moves towards modernization and the west\n* De-risk terrorism and instability threats against the US and its assets & allies, many if not most of which are proxy agents of Iran\n* Contain Russian aggression\n* Address sustainability (population growth, pollution) in the developing world\n* Lower aggregate burden on the US in maintaining the world order\n\nOf those, Russian aggression is primarily a threat to Europe only.\n\nEurope is a non-actor in the majority of those threads. Them not pulling their weight on initiatives they should be leaders on is a drag on overall foreign policy goals of the US.",

The U.S. jumped to Ukraine\u2019s aid immediately; it deployed a ton of military resources.\n\nEurope otoh deliberated and waited 6 months before committing to the conflict, as it first worked to not irk Russia and disrupt its energy supply. Its support has also been primarily financial aid; still disproportionately less military.\n\nThe EU hasn\u2019t taken a leadership position at all; Biden being left holding the bag is one of N reasons that contributed to his defeat.\n\nThe EU finger waving at Israel is similarly unhelpful.\n\nObviously the US has reached the point of frustration, and so the ball is in Europe\u2019s court to step up.",

[Statista source ](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1303432/total-bilateral-aid-to-ukraine/?__sso_cookie_checker=failed). It only took so long as eu countries wanted to coordinate with the US first to not rush anything on their own, which 100% makes sense. \n\nYet I agree that the EU and other countries are overly dependent on US military, but there has not been much need for investing more. It's been the US geopolitical strategy since ww2 - they deliver military protection, in return the partners swear allegiance and do business only with the US and its allies.\n\nMeanwhile the USA massively overspent on their military, making competition pointless for a long time, but China is catching up. One might say that the US started the arms race by insisting on global dominance instead of power balance.\nBtw most Nato countries fulfill their spending quotas since the Ukraine invasion, but Trump felt like raising his request from 2 to 5% GdP randomly.",

NATO has shown proactiveness: it has increased deterrence on the eastern flank in the wake of the Ukraine invasion; displayed a robust, coordinated approach to supporting Ukraine which has enabled that country to survive whilst maintaining stability in Europe; most members have increased their defence spending and are revamping their militaries; and added added two new allies (Finland, Sweden) with rich defence traditions of their own.\n\nNATO can be further improved by mako and continued investments in European militaries, leveraging each country\u2019s unique geopolitical situation and traditional strengths. For example Finland has a talent in Arctic warfare and activating a total defence model. The U.K., being an island with a hi-tech society, could specialise in cyber, air and naval defence. Poland could continue building defence lines and a large land army to deter ground invasions. Turkey, with its long tradition of conscription and self-confidence as a key geopolitical player, could contribute troops and other capabilities to Eastern Europe. \n\nEurope also needs to invest in European weapons manufacturing. That\u2019s a big weakness that can be worked on. It can also improve transport and logistics across the continent to ensure mobility during times of crisis.  \n\nThere\u2019s already work underway to accomplish all this, and more is to be done.",

Rather, it set out to bind Western Europe to a far vaster project of a U.S.-led world order, in which American protection served as a lever to obtain concessions on other issues, like trade and monetary policy. In that mission, it has proved remarkably successful.\" \n\nhttps://archive.ph/2023.07.26-171812/https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/opinion/nato-summit-vilnius-europe.html\n\nPeople posting here are so deeply indoctrinated into the fairytale of Western alliance as a bulwark against the outside Evil, that their understanding of history and reality is on par with that of Trump's. \n\nhttps://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2024/02/the-christmas-gift-that-keeps-giving/",

            "body": "My question to your question is: Where do you see the problems?\n\nYou name claims that financing NATO would be unfair. I would say that it is not about the financing, but about the use of the finances of any country for military, because some allies are not really into peace, for example Turkey and the US in the past. What if Erdogan said that Turkey was attacked by terrorists (kurds for example). Should we actually listen to him and help him in defense? Because the kurds are no terrorists for sure, they established a democratic autonomous region in nothern Syria and south-east turkey, where they also imprisioned many actual islamic terrorists from the war in Syria.\n\nMy claim would be that the main problem of NATO and NATO countrys is their hypocracy. What is NATO and the NATO countrys fighting for? You might say human rights, and this is what it should be, but we are far away from that, because it is in the nature of NATO to be reactionary. As long as Trump threats to invade another country (maybe even a NATO country) or threats to use tariffs against his allies NATO will be dead. In conclusion we need a new NATO, but I can tell you right now, that the US wont withdraw from supporting terrorist Israel (I thought a long time if I could call it this way, and yes, just look into the west bank and listen to smotrich and ben gvir) or terrorist Turkey, or terrorists in general that could become threats one day (greetings from Osama Bin Laden). You know NATO should be defensive, but this means that the countrys who belong to the NATO have to ask themselves twice if they should participate in a war in any ways, or if they should tell the party they are supporting \"you may go this far, but not further unless you want us end our support\".\n\nI also would not like to see a WW3 if Putin invaded another NATO country, for example the baltics (he already uses sabotage through his secret service GRU in Europe as a whole).\n\nBut these problems lead to the main problem: Why would you invest in a TO, when you are not sure wether the other countrys invest as well and stay cool in hard times, acting an ethically good way? You cant.\n\nI claim that NATO and Trump would not have to worry about defensive spendings if they had an ethical codex that prohibits countrys from supporting wars you cant support as a good person. NATO-countrys have to stop their striving for power before becoming actual defenders of a morally good world, because othervise you support a world that is not necesarilly as morally good as you might like. This is also the reason why many European people want to establish an european defense. They can rely on each other more or less, while Trump imposes threats to them. They can trust each other. In my opinion supporting NATO is not smart. It missed reforms for a long time and is braindead; Somehow alive, only physically, but not mentally. Maybe it is too late and we need something new. A TO that helps not only in a war, but also in a conflict where GRU uses sabotage of IT safety, safety for infrastructure..... War is a lot more multidimensional, and fighting war means making sure that there is no way to prepare it with sabotage. A strong military and many bombs might be necesarry as a second step if step one does not work (for defending \"friendly countrys\" as long as they are friendly, like Ukraine and in some parts Israel, and if necesarry also the European territory). Europe might have to increase the investments in security, but as I said: NATO is way too braindead to just pump money in its existence, a european defense strategy (so not only money for weapons, but also safe infrastructure) is much more efficient and reasonable.\n\nBut saying: \"Mimimi country X does not spend enough\" is way too undercomplex and does not adress fundamental problems NATO has no answer to. It is not too late to transfer the organs of the braindead body to a new, healthy and useful body.",
