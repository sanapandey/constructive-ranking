    "selftext": "I'm concentrating on the EU in this post, as I don't know much about pensions and walfare in the US.\n\nRecently I've been learning about demographics of Europe and EU in particular. The big problem that is frequently discussed is [ageing of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing_of_Europe), which refers to increasing number of old people, who consume a lot of resources both in healthcare system and pensions, whilst the increase in tax payer population cannot keep the pace, leading to increased taxations with all the associated negatives for the economy.\n\nSo my question is: what can be done? We can increase retirement age (I've seen ideas of canceling pensions completely), introduce migrants as taxpayers (this is causing a lot of arguments and fuels conservative parties), or just kind of wait for 50 years to \"ride the wave\" of changing demographics, which to me seems rather ineffective.\n\nWould love to hear some opinions on this matter.",

Those who could save enough money or resources might have been able to coast through their last years, but there weren\u2019t many of them. Others who simply got too old to work would live with family. Close-knit families are gradually becoming less common, too. \n\nI am not suggesting that we return to a system with no retirement, but the idea that anyone *deserves* to be able to retire at any age doesn\u2019t come from any logical source. Social Security is woven pretty tightly into the U.S. fabric, so eliminating it would be a pretty tough chore anyway. I\u2019m not counting on it for my retirement, but I have been laying into it, so I wouldn\u2019t mind a monthly check. \n\n401Ks, IRAs and other investments aren\u2019t guaranteed, even for people who have accumulated substantial amounts.  Everyone should at least be prepared to keep working into old age. \n\nCanada has been pushing euthanasia.

And arguably the situation has not improved despite immigration, as many of the immigrants don't want to work the required care jobs.

I suggest higher capital tax, increased (and creating) taxes on financial transactions (especially on the stock market and related), redoing the migration system so that proper migration becomes much easier (increasing the younger population again and creating a worker base), including massivly increasing cheap offers of language courses and setting a maximum limit for a complete immigration process from entry into the country to acceptance/denial of 2 month, with consequences for the offices that do not comply. Increase public schooling and childchare spending to increase population job compatibility and enable lower-income households to work fulltime. Equalize worker protections and minimum wage throughout the EU to incentivize settling companies all over instead of wage dumping in lower-wage countries. Reduce \"tax heaven\" countries or increase their EU contribution as a punishment. Reduce the capability of single countries to block EU decisions to increase EU goverment effectivness. Start to slowly phase out the USA out of NATO so that it can finally migrate into a unified european force (which the USA blocks for decades). Further the european power grid.\n\n//EDIT changed accidental centuries to decades.",
