    "selftext": "There's is momentum in a\u00a0*slightly*\\-theoretical but still tangible movement to repeal the income tax. I'm sure many of you are familiar with the\u00a0[Fair Tax Act](https://buddycarter.house.gov/uploadedfiles/118h25.pdf), the premise is around abolishing the IRS, and introducing consumption tax (in effect, removing other forms of taxes such as income, estate, etc).\n\nThere's a pretty interesting read by John Cochrane on advocacy for this that I remember reading last year:\u00a0[https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/its-time-us-abolished-income-tax](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/its-time-us-abolished-income-tax)\u00a0and a more thorough read on pros and cons by Bankman & Fried, at Stanford\u00a0[https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/publication/257986/doc/slspublic/86GeoLJ539.pdf](https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/publication/257986/doc/slspublic/86GeoLJ539.pdf)\u00a0(yup, that's SBF's dad \ud83d\ude02)\n\nThought I'd open up a discussion right before everyone heads to the weekend -\n\n* How do you feel about this prospective change? For context, other economists do argue that the Fair Tax act is insufficient, and the actual consumption tax rate will need to be much higher to keep everything running\n* In the backdrop of this is the idea that our current tax code is actually too complicated/byzantine. Do you agree (if you file US taxes)?\n* Impact on the tax + accounting industry in whole - mainly, how real this proposal where we might actually see serious consideration on people's careers? If you're an accountant or work in taxes - how do you feel?\n\nTalked about this with some friends last night, so it's top of mind and would love to get some thoughts.",

They sound \"fair\" to the uneducated, but lower-income people will always be more impacted by such taxes and have less disposable income (kinda by definition). Same for any \"flat tax\" of x% for everyone.\n\nThese are just scams by the wealthy to push the tax burden further and further onto the lower incomes, making themselves richer by laws rather than by actually doing or producing anything more.",

Income tax rates are already really pretty high, but rich people have battled over the definition of income. In the end I pay a huge chunk of my salary while rich people take out loans against their stocks tax free, or offset or defer their income with paper losses.\n\nSo who gets to decide what is essential and what is not? The rich will find a way to define extra homes, travel, high end restaurant trips, phone service, utilties, etc. as business expenses instead of luxuries. Normal people will again be stuck paying the full taxes on these items.\n\nThe fact is we *could have* been progressive with our current income tax, and chose not to (or elected people who chose not to). Rich people want the fair tax because they want to pay less taxes. They are not going to implement progressive sales taxes unless it's to their own benefit.\n\nOur tax rate is already 'progressive' on paper, and that's how it'll be with a 'fair tax.'",

In this case it would be a tax exemption from the NST.    Once you start expanding the number of exemptions the tax rate on everything else will go up.   Politicians are elected to give one group an advantage over another group.  \n\nAnother issue is that special interests will lose out under a NST.  Ex,   Accountants and companies like H&R Block (who already pay politicians to not simplify the current tax filing system). \n\nTransparency.   The NST provides transparency about the cost of government because the rate appears on the receipt of everything you buy.  Politicians like to hide the cost of government. \n\nThe NST also requires the repeal of the 16th Amendment otherwise the NST would morph into the VAT.  That's a heavy lift. \n\nIt's too complicated.  Voters are too stupid to grasp the difference between the tax exclusive rate and the tax inclusive rate.   They won't understand the prebate which reduces the regressiveness of the NST. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Fair-Tax-Book-Saying-Goodbye/dp/0060875496\n\n\nNST = National Sales Tax",

And, of course, it could be said that the current tax code is overly complicated as well.\n\n\nThe net result, though, would be a simpler tax system for most people involved. And, don't forget, the wealthy will be paying tax on their flights, private jets and the fuel for them. Probably a good idea to tax leases as well. I suppose tax flight would be an issue, but isn't it already? How many companies have been doing business in Ireland these days?\n\n\nAnd I thought that home and vehicle ownership was always a matter of public record. Of course people will try to find a way around paying these sorts of taxes, but I figure that if a home has a higher value relative to the median in an area the sale should probably always be taxed. If it's a lower value relative to said median maybe a buyer looking for a primary residence could get a break for their first home.\u00a0\n\n\nThe idea being that someone with money that's purchasing a home that will likely increase in value would be taxed, and someone poor that's just trying to put a roof over their head would not.\n\n\nEnforcement would be an issue, but, again, it already is with the income tax. The IRS investigates people on a relatively frequent basis.\n\nEdit: With a system like this someone like an Al Capone who is dodging paying taxes on a very large income still goes to jail, and a small-time drug dealer will pay taxes every time he buys something. Even people on social security would be paying into this system. That might bother some people, but it doesn't bother me. The stipend should take care of most of that, and it could eventually be increased as the likely insolvent SS program is phased out.\n\nBut, I have to admit, I like the monthly stipend the most. It's a backdoor UBI, and gives people a little money at the beginning of the month to pay their rent, and such.\n\n\nHey, I get it. It's a radical change, but it's difficult for people to dodge. I suppose that might be why some people wouldn't like it.\n\n\nEdit 2: My one reservation about the whole thing is the idea that healthcare might be taxed. Healthcare that's already too expensive for a great number of people. And, essentially, someone could be disproportionately taxed for being born with poor health.\u00a0\n\n\nSome people might welcome this sort of thing, though.

I'm not for full repeal, because it is an effective way to ensure that those that can afford it pay more to fund essential services (e.g. infrastructure) that betters society at large.  A consumption tax is regressive whereas an income tax is progressive.\n\nI'm against the estate tax, it is punitive against savers or those that want to leave their money to family members who aren't as well off as they are, but I'd be on board with eliminating the step in basis at death, which is an unfair advantage for those who can afford to hold on to an asset until they die (or rather, their beneficiaries).\n\nThere are times when an entire industry may need to see change in the name of progress.  A good current example is the coal industry, including miners.  Miners' careers should not impede the transition away from coal, and accountants' careers should not impede the simplification of the income tax code.  There are programs the federal government can support that would help those workers train for adjacent careers.  And I think even if the individual income tax code is simplified to the point where the average person could file their tax return themselves, businesses would still have complexities, such as expensing and compliance with certain regulations, that an accountant would be crucial.\n\nA national consumption tax, in the form of a VAT, has been proven to be among the most efficient taxes in terms of collection, so that could have its place alongside a simplified income tax with a much lower rate.  That rate could be zero up to the national median income (covering half of the population), a low rate up to the 67th percentile, and a higher rate (but still reduced from the 37% it is now) for those that are wealthy.  And the VAT need not be 20% as it is in Europe, especially if that would be too regressive in the US.  It could be much lower, along with a higher income tax rate for the wealthy.",

If they can't survive on their own without a welfare check from the USA then they'll die on the vine and a new governor will take their place.  Aiding allies like Ukraine and Israel is different but I don't think it should be a blank check. \n\nThose shots aren't free they're paid for by taxes.  Those can also be cut.
