Generally speaking, the United States in it's past is seen as less tolerant than the modern political climate in terms of what is socially acceptable. Do you think he would of done better or worse if he ran in say, the 80s or 90s when he was much more well liked?",

He spent most of the '90s mired in bankruptcy cases; his business reputation at that point was synonymous with failure. He was able to rebrand using the success of The Apprentice. \n\nIn my opinion, The Apprentice was an essential ingredient for the popularity that his eventual presidential run was built on, and any attempt to run for president before that would have failed--as we saw in 2000.",

According to people who were around Trump at the time, he was fascinated by how much money FOX News was raking in, and how much sociopolitical power the network had, mostly based on right-wing culture war punditry. At that time, Trump had run for President once before (as an independent), with no real success in getting any traction. But he had managed to accrue some political clout and a great deal of public attention for his \"Birtherism\" lie about Obama not being born in the US ( a stupid lie, because even if he'd been born in Kenya, nobody was disputing that Obama's mother was an American citizen, thus making him born an American). \n\nThe book alleges that Trump's plan was to run for President, use the platform to garner as much attention as possible, and then try to leverage all of that into a 24 cable network, *Trump TV*. He didn't actually expect to win the Republican nomination, let alone win the general election. Since then, multiple sources who were there, have acknowledged that he was dumbfounded and ecstatic when the returns starting coming in. When it was clear he would win (in 2016), Melania is said to have run out of the room in tears. \n\nGiven Trump's decades long history of trying to step into markets he didn't have the experience to be successful in (Trump Airline, Trump Casino's, Trump Steaks, etc.), this story sounds very plausible to me.",
