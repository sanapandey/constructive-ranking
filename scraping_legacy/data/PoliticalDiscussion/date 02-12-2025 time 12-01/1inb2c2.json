It became genuinely partisan under Newt Gingrich.\n\nThis dynamic is so well baked into the cake that it doesn't seem likely to change.  Trump used his TV persona to take advantage of trends that were well underway decades ago.  If it hadn't been him, it would have been someone else.\n\nStill, Trump has managed to attract a certain element of the population that is otherwise politically disengaged.  That group will probably return to being disengaged once he is gone.  The personality cult really does exist and they aren't just going to jump onto someone else's train.",

                    "body": "Trump was also recently asked if he sees Vance as his successor with MAGA and he flat out said \u201cno\u201d \u2014 tbf, I *think* Vance has said that he doesn\u2019t want to be president (I may be mistaken, but I feel like I remember that), but also it seems like some segment of the base would be willing to give him a chance after Trump. This mostly seems to be Gen Z dudes who got rolled in for Trump who like the idea of someone younger (cannot believe Vance is a millennial, ugh). So it\u2019s a small percentage of the MAGA voters. I think most are more likely to disengage post-Trump. There were way more bullet ballots than usual for the 2024 election \u2014 that proves the point that even though there are more Rs than Ds in the country now, **a lot** of those Rs will *only* turn out when Trump himself is on the ballot. The trend of more Rs than Ds also started in 2021, per Gallup, but the 2022 midterms went for Ds, so further proves the point since Trump wasn\u2019t on the ballot for midterms (similar happened in 2018 too and that was before there were more Rs than Ds). I remember Republicans in Congress largely being confused that Trump chose Vance for his running mate because they are too similar. They thought it was bad strategy because Vance appeals to the same type of voters as Trump does and doesn\u2019t bring out anybody that Trump couldn\u2019t already pull on his own (I would say he brings out even less than Trump, but they\u2019re both far-right white dudes with extremist ideas). Considering Vance\u2019s 2016 remarks about Trump being either \u201ca useful idiot or America\u2019s Hitler,\u201d it appears he landed on \u201cuseful idiot.\u201d Vance is there to suck the farts out of Trump\u2019s ass and have his Heritage Foundation buddies write up the EOs so that Trump doesn\u2019t have to do any real work. He just sits at his desk with his gigantic Sharpie and doodles his name to flash it for the camera. Just like he\u2019s on reality TV again, except it is our unfortunate reality this time. Vance is pulling every string while being able to have plausible deniability for any fallout that comes from it because the VP has no power to stop the president! Don\u2019t you know? Vance is just an ass kisser, he\u2019s harmless. (in case it\u2019s necessary, /s for those last few bits.)",

Follow me, Master.\u201d Just waiting for his perfect opportunity to gnaw off a finger to get the ring. In this case, gnawing the finger off is the 25th. Vance is definitely a smooth talking slimy soulless snake. He is playing Trump just like everyone else around Trump does. I think ideally (for him), he guides Trump into being the one to do all the super unpopular stuff from P2025, knowing there will be a lot of backlash for it\u2026. so that way, by the time Vance uses the 25th, he can use the plausible deniability of the VP not having any *real* power to stop the president\u2019s agenda and come out with his hands at least *appearing* clean to anybody who isn\u2019t caught onto his bs. Which will totally include at least some liberals. Sucks for him that he has the personality of a wet noodle, so even if he manages to pull off something like that, I don\u2019t think he will have as much bipartisan support as he might believe he would in the aftermath.",

Trump doesn't want another Mike Pence, he wants a stooge.  Vance is a yes man. He yes manned when he thought Trump bad would get him what he wanted. He then became a Trump yes man because Trump was his stepping stone. He's even supported white nationalism and bigotry when his kids would be harmed by it..all to get to the big office.\n\nHe may succeed, Trump's old. But staying there will be more difficult since he's got the same level of charisma as a side of ham to a vegan Muslim.",

I\u2019m not saying there couldn\u2019t be one, but who ever it is has yet to emerge, and unlike most authoritarians, Trump has only really come into his power as, let\u2019s be honest, a sundowning old man.

A successor means he isn't president, which is something he cannot allow because his whole freedom is tied to being president. It gives him the television time he craves and more importantly keeps New York from putting him in prison. Unfortunately for him, 20/1/2028 is coming, and after that it doesn't matter what Trump thinks.\n\nHe also won't get a third term, since no matter how loyal the GOP base is, the elections are run by states. States that are either held by democratic party members, unelected judiciary not beholden to Trump, or worse.. traitor Republicans. \n\nWe saw this last time Trump tried to screw shit up. Nobody actually put any effort into overturning the constitution at the elected level. The closest we got was Senator Hawley giving the protesters (at the time) a fist bump before bolting like mad when they became insurrectionists.",

That's the only way \"normal\" conservatives are likely to ever become electable again, but it would mean doing too much to break the oligarchy of the 1% so they prefer to keep either selling out to Trump or whining ineffectively.",

At some point he coerces her to perform acts she is uncomfortable acts, or perform them for another 'friend' of the pimp, and thereafter tells the young woman that she is no longer pure or worthy of anything better.  The pimp stigmatizes her until it becomes self-stigma and she thinks no better of herself and ceases trying to not conform to his demands.*\n\nMany Republicans not do not believe they can not identify with the Maga cult.  After Trump, Project 2025 will still remain as the blueprint for the Maga political party (Republican in name only) and continue dismantling the democratic structures.  Thus,\n\nI do not believe anyone can wait for Trump to leave, fall very ill, or pass the torch. The fire is lit, and a lot of accelerant has already been added.",

It is not some broad conspiracy to fleece the public.  \n\nOn to auditing.  Yes, I'd LOVE for the goverment to have an actual audit with actual accountants and people who understand what they are looking at, not some tech bros snooping around in files and systems they have no right to be in.  \n\nIf you're putting your faith in a NotSee and a life long conman you've got more to worry about than what the government is doing.",

That figure represents about 0.84 percent of $8.6 trillion in benefits paid over that time. A\u00a0November 2021 report\u00a0estimated that the agency had made $298 million in payments after death to about 24,000 beneficiaries, and urged the agency to improve the timeliness and accuracy of its death data.\"\n\nSo, yes, we already knew that there were errors/fraud in the payment system. We should fix it. But it's less than 1% of Social Security spending. This is the equivalent of the average American family making an error on their taxes of about $140 (out of $17k). Meanwhile Musk is (illegally) shutting down whole government agencies. It's just wildly out of proportion.\n\nIn all seriousness, if Musk weren't doing any of this feeding USAID into the wood chipper type stuff, and he just brought on some people to inspect federal payments and reduce fraud and accidental payments... awesome. Go for it.",

Mistakes can happen all the time,  and scammers can find ways to abuse any system. Elon is proof of that, DOGE whole model is to abuse the current US legal system.",

E.g., I might focus on laws that make it simpler to zone and build stuff. There was just a nice episode of the [NYT Daily podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/podcasts/the-daily/china-trump-trade.html) talking about how China is outcompeting the US in part because their authoritarian regime has focused on building new systems at scale. We could do that too, without being authoritarian - but it'd take some centralized efforts to make building easier.\n\nBut if someone wants to prioritize saving the federal government $7 billion per year in mispaid Social Security checks, that sounds nice too! Maybe they don't quite get all the way there, but maybe they save a few bilion - that's not nothing. Just as long as they don't make it their *entire* focus, or use it as excuse to wipe out federal agencies.",
