Having no control over any of the branches of government leaves the  opposition party with hardly any ability to stop the elected party from implementing the agenda it ran on. Hopefully the courts will step up and block the illegal parts. Other than what's illegal, I think the Republicans should get to implement their desired policies. It looks like those desired policies are what is in Project 2025 (even though Trump lied as a candidate and said he wouldn't be implementing Project 2025). That brings me back to the point that its unpopularity should ultimately matter (at least if we have legitimate elections in the future).",

The supreme court of NC sent the order back down to the Wake County Court, basically saying that this was not their circus, not their monkey. They want to see how Wake County will go before making a ruling. It's worth noting that the original ruling was not necessarily a ruling throwing out the ballots, but rather a stay on certification until the legal battle was fought. Riggs will likely continue to try and appeal this to a federal court, as there this would most definitely get thrown out. It seems extremely unlikely that Griffin will win this legal battle, and it seems like Griffin is just delaying the inevitable loss. The NC court did not just rubber stamp Griffin's win, but rather just put a stay on the certification until Griffin was heard in a court of law and all appeals were heard.",

Sure, they didn\u2019t *like* their powers eroding, but the alternative was the leader expelling them from the party and their seat entirely. It starts with media manipulation and a cult of personality. A few examples of Liz Cheney and suddenly most are more scared of him in a primary than of Democratic challengers in November. \n\nLenin was good at manipulating intra-party politics too. He purged the \u201cMensheviks\u201d and emerged firmly in charge as the Bolsheviks\u2019 leader. The purges got more violent with time; only under Stalin did firing squads for intra-party defiance become the go-to. \n\nAnd it\u2019s *not* alarmist to say Trump is trending in this direction.

In late December, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Trump is disqualified from the ballot. The Court ruled that the events of January 6th were an insurrection against the U.S. Constitution, that Trump engaged in that insurrection, that Trump\u2019s speech inciting the insurrection was not protected by the First Amendment and that Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment applied to Trump. That decision followed an oral argument before the court, and a decision from the Denver County District Court that Trump did engage in insurrection, but which stopped short of disqualifying Trump over the technicality of whether the president is an \u201cofficer\u201d of the United States and whether the presidency is an \u201coffice\u201d under the United States. The District Court\u2019s decision followed weeks of pre-trial briefing and a five day evidentiary hearing in which both the petitioners and Trump presented their case, including hours of video evidence, thousands of pages of documents and testimony and cross examination of 15 witnesses.",

Maybe former Representative Mary Peltola (who actually did manage to win a statewide AK election with a \"D\" beside her name, even though her service ended up being rather brief after she lost re-election in 2024) will run for Senate here.\n\nFlorida, Ohio - The days of these states being swing/ battleground states is long gone. Maybe Sherrod Brown tries to run to regain a Senate seat in 2026, but... if Ohioans really liked Sherrod Brown that much, they would have just re-elected him in 2024.\n\nMaine - Mainers really just seem to love electing Susan Collins. Maybe the Dems can unseat her this time, but I honestly expect her to keep that seat until she dies sitting in it.\n\nNorth Carolina - Thom Tillis defeated his Democratic challenger by just 2% in 2020, so I suspect this is probably the \"easiest\" one for the Dems to flip. But again, they need a good candidate and a good campaign.\n\nTexas - I think the only reason that some Texas Senate elections have been close is because Ted Cruz is just a flat out unlikeable human being. Unfortunately for the Dems, Cruz isn't up for election in 2026. Instead, it's John Cornyn, who has easily defeated every Democratic challenger he's come across.\n\nSo basically, to gain Senate control, the Dems need to...\n\n1) **Win all three** battleground state Senate elections (GA, MI, NH)\n\n**AND**\n\n2) **Flip four** of the following states currently held by Republicans (AK, FL, ME, NC, OH, TX)\n\nSuffice to say... not easy.",

                            "body": "I definitely agree with parts of this and Dems will have their work cut out for them. That being said, a few things:\n\n* 2026 will definitely be a test for the durability of Trump\u2019s influence on the party. The data would suggest Republicans do poorly when Trump isn\u2019t on the ballot. He certainly won\u2019t be in 2026 and Republicans are going to have to explain why Trump\u2019s chaos is actually good. While Democrats need to focus on Trump to some extent, they also need to lay the ground work to ensure the rest of republicans are blamed for what is happening. Republicans could work to control and moderate Trump, but they won\u2019t. \n* it\u2019s definitely a tough map. Some notes on your states:\n  * I don\u2019t think NH or MI are toss ups. They are lean Dem. I\u2019m not saying they will be easy, but they definitely lean in favor of Dems.\n  * I think Susan Collins is gone. I could be wrong, but her naivet\u00e9 and poor judgment are well catalogued at this point and in a non Trump year I think she is going to struggle. \n  * I think MT and NE could be in play if Dems (1) find an independent challenger in these states and (2) start talking about busting ag monopolies. I know that\u2019s a big ask, but running on trust busting should not be a campaign killer. The cattle ranching industry is currently being eaten alive by what is essentially a meat packing cartel. Dems were pushing all kinds of additions to the farm bill. These need to be heavily bespoke campaigns but should actually focus on issues that Dems care about that most republicans would be terrified to talk about. These states are also worth fighting for because the media markets are significantly cheaper than somewhere like Texas. \n  * The rest of the states are tough for sure. \n* One of the things Dems should be doing is looking for ways to divide the right. The Republican coalition actual has many factions which have a hodgepodge of conflicting positions. But someone is going to have to be wrong. Republicans are really strong in using identity and resentment politics when they are in the opposition, but that\u2019s not enough to govern. They often are really bad when it comes time for solutions because suddenly they can\u2019t just dodge and say Dems are to blame (I mean they do, but I think that only gets so much mileage especially with swing voters). Anyway, stoke the H1B fight. Keep messaging on billionaires. Keep asking if Republicans have more than a concept of a plan. \n* Trump isn\u2019t getting the robust economy that he had in 2017. I don\u2019t think the economy in 2021 was bad, but it wasn\u2019t great and it\u2019s in a very fragile state. I know the messaging on eggs has shifted, but all kinds of things are going to go up and while some of the cultier supporters are going to persist in their thinking, some of the less attached and normies are going to stop cheering and maybe start defecting. Some of their support I do think is very much going to be conditioned on how prices go and given what Trump is doing, it\u2019s not looking great. \n\nOverall, even winning the house is an okay thing. It reopens a point of leverage and gives Dems subpoena and investigation powers. The senate will be tough, but that is life for Dems at this point; the senate is going to be fought for the foreseeable future.",

We've seen since 2016 that when Trump isn't on the ballots the turnout math massively favors Democrats and if Trump's plans for the economy are actually implemented, that will likely be doubly true in 2026 when we may be in a recession. Brown will have the proble of already being seen as a loser, but he can maybe make up for it. Also, if he runs again and really looks like he can win, the crypto industry may spend $100 million to help his opponent. \n\nFor Maine and North Carolina, the big question will be who the Republican nominee will actually be. Bot Collins and Tillis will have to strategically oppose Trump sometimes if they want to win the general, and that may trigger a Trump endorsed well financed primary opponent. If a crazy Trumper wins the primary in NC and ME, particularly if we are in a recession, they will lose in the general.\n\nTo a lesser extent, the same sentiment can apply to Texas, Iowa, Indiana, Louisiana, and maybe even Kentucky, but they have much more leeway and Trump would have to be significantly more unpopular than he's ever really been for that to be a factor. \n\nThere's also a chance that in certain places Dems allow an independent to challenge the Republican in the general without a real D on the ballot like they did in Nebraska last election. That could be a very effective move in states that just refuse to vote D, but aren't very happy with Trump.\n\nEither way, Republicans and Trump would really have to fuck up to see anything worse than a 50-50 Senate after the midterms, but they've really fucked up the last two midterm cycles so it's all possible. \n\nIn the House, Dems likely regain the majority, but it's possible the courts ok some really fucked up maps in Republican states that skew the math enough to keep Dems in the minority.",
