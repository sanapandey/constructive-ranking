Will my salary change?)\n* **What should I do about it?** (e.g., Should I buy certain things now before prices go up? Should I save more money?)\n\nFor example, if a new **tariff** is placed on imported goods from China,  does it mean:\n\n* Higher prices on everyday items like smartphones, clothes, and cars.\n* Some U.S. businesses might benefit (e.g., American-made products become more competitive).\n* Other industries might struggle (e.g., companies that rely on imported materials might raise prices or cut jobs).\n\nWhat do you think?",

            "body": "You\u2019ve got the right idea\u2014policies like tariffs do impact our everyday lives, but it really depends on how they play out. \n\nWhat might happen with Trump's tariffs:\n\n1. Will this cost me more money?\n\nHigher prices on imports:\nWhen tariffs are slapped on stuff like electronics, clothes, and cars, companies might pass those costs onto you.\nFor example, a 25% tariff on a $1,000 laptop from China could make it cost $1,250. Not ideal!\n\nPrice hikes in other industries:\nIf businesses rely on materials from abroad, they might raise prices. For example, higher tariffs on steel and aluminum can make cars and appliances more expensive.\n\nAmerican-made goods might cost more too:\nIf imports get too pricey, U.S. companies might step up, but things might still cost more because American-made products often have higher labor costs.\n\n\n2. Will I make more or less money?\n\nJob shifts, not necessarily more jobs:\nSome manufacturing jobs could come back in areas like steel or auto production. But industries that depend on imported goods (tech, retail, agriculture) might see job cuts.\nFor example, U.S. farmers lost a lot of business due to China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs.\n\nWage impact:\nIf prices rise faster than wages, your purchasing power might drop. And if factories move to places like Vietnam, American workers might not see much of a benefit.\n\n\n3. What should I do about it?\n\nShort-term:\nIf you hear about a tariff coming, you might want to buy big-ticket items (electronics, appliances) before prices go up. Stocking up on stuff that could get more expensive is a good move.\n\nLong-term:\nIf tariffs stick around, wages might adjust, but saving money and investing will be more important. If you're in an affected industry, maybe learning new skills or looking for other opportunities could help.\n\n\nExample: Trump's 2018-2019 China Tariffs\n\nWashing machine prices went up around 12% after tariffs.\n\nU.S. farmers took a hit because China slapped tariffs on soybeans and pork.\n\nSome manufacturing jobs came back, but the overall economy slowed a bit because of the trade disruptions.",

In auto manufacturing for example, components end up shipped back and forth across the border repeatedly by the time finally assembly is finished. Think about all the small parts that go into making a driver's seat--the motors for adjusting it, the buttons and handles to activate the motors, heating elements, cloth/leather, padding, the attachments, seat belts, etc.\n\nThese components might be made in Mexico (from raw materials that could be made in the US), shipped to the US to be assembled into a seat, shipped to Canada to be installed into the car, and shipped back to the US as a finished car. Each country is going to charge a tariff on the total value of whatever's shipped across the border at each stage of assembly, not just the final product.\n\nThe value of the seat is higher when it's finally ready for installation in the car, because the value of its components were all higher due to tariffs, so the tariff on the seat is higher than it would otherwise be. And then the value of the car is higher, because of the tariffs already paid on the seat, so the tariff on the car is calculated based on the inflated value including all the previous tariffs.",

That would make things from US more expensive to buyers there. There could also be some negative sentiment generated by all these, just look at what's happening in Canada.",

Tariffs are inherently trade wars. Even threats of trade wars spur resentment and relationships turn from warm to cool. Say what you want about the short tiff with Columbia, but they just announced they will cancel an $880 million deal with the US on 'environmental grounds.' Expect American businesses to take soft hits on their business as foreign counterparts see American Exceptionalism more as American Imperialism.  Nobody likes being bullied and we have a mafia wannabe in the White House. All of that will eventually blow back on the American consumer, but they don't appear exceptionally suited to connect the dots.",

I guess it would encourage people to buy stuff grown & made in America which is always good. But trumps more than likely using the threat of tariffs as a strategy to negotiate. Like border security for example, if they don\u2019t want to be tariffs then they have to secure their border.",

Specifically regarding tariffs to Mexico and Canada only - Do we think Trump really will impose these tariffs or they are strictly bargaining chips to get what he wants. Both received thirty day extensions and they both are slightly giving into his demands regarding border security. I personally think they are being used as threats (specifically Mexico and Canada) to get what he wants and won\u2019t happen. I could be wrong however, just a thought. I think the tariffs hurt Mexico and Canada economy significantly worse than us if it does happen. But we will also probably see higher prices on goods at the end of the day.",

If it doesn't, will actually imposing tariffs work? Fine. If none of these ideas work or can even be implemented, can I pretend that I was just kidding the entire time and laugh at people for taking me seriously because I totally played them all or maybe just blame the whole mess on someone I don't like or pretend that none of this ever even happened?
