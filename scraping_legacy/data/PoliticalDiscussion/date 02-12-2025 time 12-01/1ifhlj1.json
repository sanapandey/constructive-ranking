    "selftext": "I was pondering over the results of this election and wondering why so many young men are voting for the conservative party these days.\n\nI came across this article from 2024 and it really made me think Have Democrats Given Up on Men? - The Survey Center on American Life https://www.americansurveycenter.org/newsletter/have-democrats-given-up-on-men/\n\nWhen you look at the Democratic Party home page for 'Who They Serve', they include Women specifically and exclude Men, outside of certain groupings that include them.\n\ndemocrats.org/who-we-are/who-we-serve/\n\nI'm curious what people have to say on this topic and will save my personal opinions for the comment section. Is it a wise thing for Democrats to bank on the morality of a large portion of the population rather than showing direct support, to gain votes?",

I'm not saying that these groups aren't often forgotten and don't need attention at times, but I do think that as Americans, we all have a tendency to push things to the extreme, even inclusivity. Pushing too far left can alienate people in the middle just as much as pushing too far right.",

Like, [every time this topic comes up on this sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1fcuw3z/what_strategies_can_democrats_employ_to_address/) it's full of \"Well, women on Twitter are saying they choose the bear, which is how the Democrats are alienating men\" non sequiturs. \n\nA person who votes for the party is not the party. Parties in the US contain tens of millions of voters; they are inevitably going to contain voters who say things that alienate you. But a random 23-year-old on Twitter saying she chooses the bear is not the same thing as Kamala Harris saying she chooses the bear. If the standard you're operating by is that any voter of the party saying anything annoying can alienate you from the party, then the logical endgame of that stance is you aren't going to be able to vote for anybody.",

                    "body": "Yes, I know it's anecdotal, but here is one of my experiences at a late September campaign event for a Democratic candidate:\n\nI am a straight white man, and have always supported leftist politics.  I went to a campaign event with the intention of making the maximum donation I could for the candidate (a woman).  When I got there, there was a giant banner that said \"The Future Is Female\", which I found a little off putting, but it wasn't a dealbreaker, we see this kind of female-empowerment-at-the-expense-of-men rhetoric a lot in the party, which always kind of bugged me.\n\nDuring a part of the event where nobody was speaking and everyone was just socializing, a campaign manager came over to my table and was schmoozing with several of the ladies sitting near me, and it seemed to me that she was actively avoiding making eye contact with or even acknowledging the men in our party.  Several men even asked her questions directly or tried to involve themselves in the conversation, and were completely ignored outright.  Then, she dropped the line \"I just love that the Democratic Party is a place that everyone gets an equal voice, regardless of race, gender, economic background, or sexual orientation!  Except straight white men, they can go fuck themselves!\", to which another staffer, right on cue, chimed in and said \"And you just KNOOOOOOW they will!\"  This got a round of snaps and \"Yass Qween\"'s from other ladies nearby, to which point I got up and left without making my donation, along with 4 other men that were nearby, and we wound up chatting outside the venue about how rude that was and how I was probably going to leave that one blank on my ballot now.\n\n  \nThat candidate lost by only 2449 votes.  Makes me wonder how many of those 2448 other ones would have voted for her had her campaign not outright insulted them to their faces.\n\n  \nThis is the problem with the Democratic party, especially with younger male voters.  It's not necessarily specific policies that they are pushing, but more about the general vibe (which is what young voters care far more about than policy).  The dems haven't done anything to even acknowledge men's issues, and are far more likely to tell men, even their own male supporters, that they ARE the issue, even if they haven't done anything wrong at all.  Even if they have consistently come out to support the left, they're constantly under fire in left leaning spaces as absolute monsters that need to atone for the crimes of people that are only connected by the fact that both have a dick.\n\nIf pretty much any of the things regularly said about men on the left were said about ANY other group, the speaker would be raked over, cancelled, humiliated, and doxxed.  But for some reason, it's perfectly fine to spew blatant misandry, and most likely it is celebrated and cheered.\n\nSo yes, Dems have not only given up on men, they have made them their boogieman to blame everything on.  It's openly sexist, and the right isn't stupid because they saw this and gave some basic lip service, and won over, oh, i dunno, about 3%... which was all they needed to win.  With margins this tight, it was the absolute stupidest move they could have made.",

I can read between the lines to understand that they're using broad language to critique a flaw they see as somewhat prevalent among nerds, but they're not actually hating on all nerds.\n\nYeah, maybe the lack of showering by a few nerds has soured people toward all nerds. In which case, it would behoove me not to get defensive at the critique, but instead to work within my social circle to encourage folks to shower so folks would stop having the unkind impression of nerds.\n\nPeople bluster and exaggerate and go with vibes over nuance. It's just the human experience.\n\nAnd importantly, like, what's the worst that'll happen? The stuff people complain about 'white men' over are things like sexual assault and using political influence to ensure resources go to those who are already prosperous rather than helping whole communities in need. Like, it really hurts people. Do you think men are in danger from women? That white people are in danger from non-white folks?\n\nThe goal is equal treatment in society and under the law. You really ought to cheer that on, and be a hero by aiding the movement. By getting upset, I dunno man, you sound kinda pissy and weak. Which I imagine is the exact opposite of how the average man wants to feel about himself.\n\nNick Offerman is not a soy boy.

But I don't know what reality you've been paying attention to where you think Dems *aren't* trying to provide more services for mental health and to fund better access to education and to - this is key - push back against the somewhat pervasive view that boys and men who aren't doing well are lazy or bad and have brought their plight upon themselves.\n\nI'm trying for a kid right now. Boy or girl, I sure as hell would prefer the sorts of investments Democrats are pushing for and the general framing of social welfare that the left prefers to the \"be tough or die\" vibes the right goes for.\n\nAgain, I don't know the specific individuals from the anecdote of shrill man-hating feminism. But I would imagine that any lefty activist, if you asked them to support more social support for men's physical and mental health and men's education, would be totally on board.",

That's a far cry from a banner reading \"The Future is Women\". You seem to be moving goal posts?\n\nThe whole \"picking the bear\" is a very different argument, and one I think men would be wise to stop and listen to. To consider what is actually being said, before jumping to the conclusion that the discussion is hateful or somehow \"dehumanizing\" of men. The anecdote exposes how vulnerable and targeted women in our society feel. It should be a wake up call for men. But in a culture where more than half of women experience sexual violence in their lifetime, maybe not enough men care to do that.",

They're still at the same spot. \n\nAnd no, I'm not going to listen to women that choose the bear because they co-opted Nazi language that is offensive and sexist, and I refuse to engage with Nazi language. Just like I would refuse to engage with a man who said misogynistic things, because bigoted statements should never be entertained or encouraged, regardless of who they are against. And you do realize that vast majority of that crime is committed by a tiny sliver of the male population, as well as a tiny sliver of the female population (which almost always goes uncharged and with zero consequences), but most of the women choosing the bear openly state that they would rather blame all men so that they can keep the narrative that men are bad and women are victims?

You asked for a specific example of how the Democrats are actively turning away men. I gave you a specific example. The margins are really tight, within 2% points, so losing even just a handful of Democratic men because of rampant misandrist language in regular party discourse is enough to lose an election. Which I also cited an example of, and said candidate lost by less than 2%.\n\nI'm not a conservative at all, and the Dems are obviously more favorable, which is why I'm screaming about this problem, which lost a not insignificant number of men, especially young men. I'm shouting this not because I \"hate the Dems\" or that i'm secretly a trumper as so many people on here accuse me of, but because I want the Dems to knock off the identity politics bullshit, take a goddamn good look in the mirror, actually reflect on the shitty, sexist behavior going on ALL OVER the party, stop doing those things, and get back to actually winning elections. \n\nUnfortunately, a lot of the Dems that are doing these things are completely allergic to accountability and recognizing that they are contributing to the problem, so instead of actually fixing it, they're doubling down and going even harder.... Which will inevitably lead to even more losses. Which really sucks because, well, *-gestures grandly to absolutely everything going on right now-*....\n\nPolicy wise, it's not what the Dems are doing, it's what they AREN'T doing. What they should be doing is focusing on the working class instead of focusing on \"smashing the patriarchy\".",

I just wrote out how men aren't doing well in modern society, especially financially. If a man can't provide for a family and attract a woman, he loses out on major points of meaning in his life. Men have been taught to be strong, protective, and useful. They aren't having their needs met, and after awhile, theyll follow anything that even remotely promises to do so. I would guess that a lot of men on the right dont want to take rights away and make things suck. They just want things to be better for themselves and when they look to their fathers, it seems like they had it better, so when someone comes in and says lets go back to the old days and offers regressive policies they go along.",

If you are suffering and the person you love doesn't see it, it makes you suffer more! Explicitly say that you have their back. Say out loud the men are included!!\n\nIdk why you democrats are so dense. It's basic human psychology to be seen and heard. Y'all are so stupid sometimes....\n\nJust a little something for young men to let them know \"Boys, we hear you. We understand that there's a lot going on in our lives and we need some help. We will make sure you get the support and help you need. I've needed help before to get through some tough shit, and I'm going to make sure you get the support you need to get through some tough shit together. You are worth it.\"\n\n\"You can't plan for the future when you're stuck in the present. You can't feel strong when ever bill makes you feel weak. You can't built a relationship when you feel like you have nothing to offer. Men you are suffering, we are here to help you get through it.\"\n\nAt least have that to reach out to men. Democrats are doing nothing to win votes, they are always assuming people will vote for them. They are openly letting Republicans recruit young men!!!!!\n\nThe truth is reputation proceeds all else. Democrats, liberals, and progressives are perceived to ignoring men. The online left sucks at messed up the democrat's image on men for decades. Democrats need to actively oppose this to show people that men ARE included in progress to! Don't be afraid to get canceled by terminally online leftists.\n\nWe can have both empathy for men and women. We have space in our hearts for men, women, Palestine, North Carolina, etc. sometimes leftists get too much into a suffering measuring contest.....\n\nStrong men can create great times. But strong men can also create the worsts of time if misguided. It is possible to reach out to men. Y'all are just too stubborn and given up on rehabilitation. For a party that praises empathy and inclusivity, y'all do a good job at leaving young men and men out of it.",

                    "body": "I want to make a distinction. Democrats and the DNC lost \"working class minorities\" \n\nLet's use an example. John Legend and Chrissy Teigen are both technically minorities. But they are famous, wealthy and have access to more of the upper tiers of power in this country by way of their status. Legend and Teigen poured in money to \"bail out\" those who were looting and rioting in some major cities. Who took the brunt of the burning and destruction in 2019 and 2020? Small business owners. Many of them were minority owned. Not just black, but also Asian, Hispanic and across the spectrum. \n\nLegend and Teigen did not face the consequences of that choice in their own neighborhood. Wealthy. Isolated. Gated. Lots of security. Personal bodyguards. The decision makers for the Democrat Party, those like Obama, Clinton, Schumer and Pelosi and others did not have to live with the failures of their bad policy. It was working class America that had to take the full brunt of that. \n\nThe mistake and arrogance that I believe those like Obama, Schumer, Pelosi and others made is they turned \"identity politics\" into a perspective of monoliths. In effect, that all black people should and do think this specific way and do this specific thing. But that's not true. A black young man from poverty, with no family connections and no support system, produced from bad school districts, has more in common with white, Asian and Hispanic young males from that same area than they do their wealthy counterparts elsewhere. Just because you have two young black men, it doesn't mean they automatically align. One could be headed to work at an investment bank and his parents are both college educated and have formal white collar careers. The other might be struggling to make rent while working at a grocery store, desperate to get more hours.\n\nAnd almost every avenue of engagement is insulting. Democrats blame the \"messaging\" ( i.e. we are doing great things for you, you are just too stupid to see it, thus we need to dumb down how we talk for you to \"get it\" ) but a lot of the time it's just shitty policy. Democrats also blame \"disinformation\" ( i.e. again, you are just too stupid not to be fooled, so let's \"educate\" you on what you should do for us, to give us power, so we can fix this all for you, since you are too stupid otherwise)  That goes hand in hand with calling voters as \"deplorable\" or \"garbage\" \n\nAnd, in order to facilitate the \"gaslighting\", what the DNC had to do, with most of the mainstream media being complicit, was to deny the day to day lived experiences of these working class Americans. Those every day people keep shouting that they are struggling to find affordable housing, feel safe on the streets, find good jobs and pay for groceries. For three and a half years, Psaki and Jean Pierre kept saying everything was fine. Nothing was wrong. If you think something is wrong, you must be a cultist. Or a bigot. Or a racist. Until a few months before Election Day, when the situation finally got so desperate that the Democrats admitted a lot was very very wrong. But the problem with that is it was also insulting to voters, as if those voters would magically forget the 42 months before where the gaslighting happened every day. \n\nI think the answer is simple. Democrats in power, the small group, made it clear they don't give a shit about working class people. And more than that, that they despise them. And the veil was lifted, it wasn't hidden anymore. It was made to face real sunlight. Of course people were going to leave the Democrats after that.",

Then maybe the DNC and Clinton should not have stolen the nomination from Bernie Sanders in 2016. Biden wasn't doing great in the primaries in 2020 and there was a clear strategic drop out to make sure he was the nominee. In 2024, there were no real primaries at all. Harris was chosen in private by a small number of Party \"elites\" after Biden was forced out. The DNC spent big money to try to remove Dean Phillips, RFK and Marianne Williamson off as many state ballots as possible, so there was no other choice. \n\nInstead of blaming voters, why doesn't the DNC take their thumb off the scale for a change? Have a real primary, have real debates, let millions of working class Democrats all over this country have say with their votes on who should be the nominee. And let that process, a real process, \"filter in\" the best possible candidate. \n\nThose on the left simply cannot have it both ways. They cannot keep shouting about the end of democracy but refuse to accept that the DNC has burned down any semblance of a real legitimate process anymore in the primary phase of selecting what should be the best candidate possible. \n\nPlay Stupid Games/Win Stupid Prizes\n\nThe DNC and those like Obama, Clinton and Pelosi play these stupid games to cheat the primary process, but it's all working class Democrat voters who have to get the stupid prize in the end.

A lot of young men are going over to the group that validates them and gives them attention, conservatives. \n\nWe're going to have many many years of conservative hell in front of us, if the Democratic party doesn't understand that they simply cannot count on men to vote for them simply because it's the right thing to do. They need to show they care and are offering something to men. \n\nFor the first time in American history, women are beating men in graduation rates and home ownership, when comparing single men to single women. I don't think there was every any consideration of what to do, once the scales were starting to tip the other way. \n\nBeing a victim is an addictive thing. Giving up victimhood is not something most people are willing to do, as there are always ways a group of people are being victimized, regardless of how many improvements are made. \n\nI was reading that true feminism is about destruction of the patriarchy, not the destruction of men.

Or did you mean social issues, to which you as an individual can decide on your own what values you have, despite whatever political hegemony? \n\nYou have more power as an individual than say depend on the collective, one thing I have learned is not to depend on government, rather desire to be independent from it. I understand the government has let our youth down, but it's not like I grew up with a stable government (I grew up during Vietnam and Watergate, then everything after that) that also had it's share of economic turmoil, health crisis, and war. This is not new to me, this was expected IMO, and in my middle age, I look at this as extraordinary. This is a time to be wide eyed, courageous, to really learn what freedom means, how we as individuals can determine ourselves in an extraordinary circumstance, and we need to do this together.

Men are having a hard time finding partners because women want a man who out performs them or at least equal to, where as men don't consider that as much. When young men aren't doing well, their parents suffer, watching their sons struggle. It's why we've seen young men and older generations swinging to the right.

There was a viral video of a young man and a girl he\u2019s with getting mugged. The man, quite bizarrely, turns and runs away in an instant while the girl he is with is literally left alone to have her purse snatched and possibly much worse done to her. It\u2019s disturbing to my own values too. But I have no clue if or how he has ever voted. \n\nWhat started to click for me was the slew of comments beneath all agreeing on one theme: *This guy must be a Democrat.*, variations on that abounded: \u201cGuarantee you he voted for Kamala\u201d, or \u201cThis is the sort of \u201cmen\u201d Democrat-run cities are making\u201d, in reference to the muggers, as well. \n\nOther things added to my understanding, but this was the best example. I can also think of a pink-haired YouTuber who admitted he was hesitant to talk about \u201cmale loneliness\u201d because he was scared of backlash (from Left-wing viewers) for just talking about it. And I\u2019m gonna guess this guy *does* vote Democrat, or maybe a Leftist protest vote.\n\nFor a lot of young men, the mental image they have of Democrats has *almost nothing* to do with policy issues that Harris or Bernie Sanders, much less Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries now wrangle with. Their image of Democrats is based on a batch of online men they see framed as cowardly, effeminate losers. Especially the soyboys, the femboys, trans, what have you \u2014 and any angry women who would agree with the phrase: Men don\u2019t have problems. Men *are* the problem. \n\nI don\u2019t agree this represents the median Democratic primary voter who decides on the nominees. I do think the number is sizable enough to give the \u201cmanosphere\u201d a lot of content to work with. Like Obama said in 2011-ish, \u201cIf the only things I saw about Barack Obama came from Fox News, I wouldn\u2019t vote for me, either.\u201d That alternate universe is now turbocharged 15 years later, on the personal little screen now in each man\u2019s pocket. \n\nAnd at least with Fox covering Obama, it was often tied to *some* policy issue \u2014 tan suits and latte salutes were rarer, and omens of what was to come. I think there *is* plenty to assess and criticize on the Left in policy matters. But the point is, *young right-wing men\u2019s perception of, and resentment for, the Left is almost completely divorced from those debates*. The Left is, to them, a parade of shrill women who seek to steal their opportunities and deny them sex \u2014 and the cowardly, effeminate losers who submit to those women.",

Every group listed on that webpage falls under those categories. \"African Americans\" are there because due to centuries of structural racism, they have significantly worse outcomes than other ethnic groups. \"Democrats Abroad\" are there because they tend to be out of the conversation when the party is making plans. \"Faith community\" is there because as the party most known for defending people *from* religion, the Democrats want you to know they also care about the specific needs of religious people.\n\nThey don't look at \"men\" as having unique needs because, well, men run almost everything. Now, you can agree or disagree with that, and I'm sure you can point to statistics about the suicide rate and such. But the Democrats don't look at the lack of special attention on men as \"giving up on men.\" Their point of view is more like \"of course we're serving men, everybody is serving men. Men are the default group that gets served, so we don't have to say it.\"\n\nIt's very similar to the \"White History Month\" argument you hear every February. Why do we have a Black History Month when we don't have a White History Month? And the answer is that, well, every month including February is White History Month.\n\nNow, given the trendlines in the 2024 election, I would guess that in the next couple of years, Democrats pivot to messaging toward \"men\" in the same way as they mention the \"faith community\" and the \"small business community,\" whom they are also historically viewed as not supporting.

Similarly, something that has worried me a lot as a Democrat coming out of the last election is the effectiveness of the Republicans' anti-trans messaging. What can the Democrats possibly do about that? The obvious answer is \"tone down their pro-trans messaging,\" but there *wasn't* any pro-trans messaging from them in 2024. The only real political solution is to render the Republicans' attacks moot by speaking out and legislating against trans people themselves, which isn't going to happen.",

As noted from the U.S. banking industry is that more women are choosing professional careers and are now making more money than men. And it's women who are starting their own business while taking out the majority of business loans.\n\nTodays modern men are the ones falling through the financial cracks of society. And it's those men who blame the government for the bad choices they made in their lives, and decided that voting for a convicted felon will give them wealth.\n\nDid you know that, until the 1960's, women couldn't open a bank account without a husband?\n\nToday...Women make more money then men. Wall Street says that women are better investors than men. Women are choosing to live alone; without men.\n\nFinancially desperate (conservative) men are the ones who voted for Trump. Smarter, educated men voted for Harris.",

Women aren't inherently better than men, believe it or not. There are many factors at play as to why groups succeed more than others, some of those have to do with how society perceives those groups and how society prioritizes assisting certain groups over others.\n\nWomen get a helping hand in society, so much so, that they are starting to come out on top. Men, get the help that is inherent with being men, something far less tangible and seemingly, not as useful, anymore.\n\nI'm trying to imagine you inserting a race instead of men/women into this argument. You sound a lot like people you would believe you hate and are nothing like. Weird how things like that happen, isn't it? Not to mention, your argument is actually supporting the point I was making, even though you seem to think it points to the innate inferiority of the male species. \n\nIt's weird to see someone argue for the superiority of a specific group of people and the inferiority of another...especially when the person with the argument, has no awareness of the point they are making. It's like some women see them coming out on top and are enjoying that status and are have no desire or willingness to give up that new power and want to push down anyone who may try to. Almost like...they are no better than the groups they used to hate for doing those same things to them. Huh.",

Due to the egregious nature of Trump, the rate that women are taking control of their lives is moving at a very fast clip. \n\nAlso, some of the most respected CEO's in the U.S. are now women.....Love it!",
