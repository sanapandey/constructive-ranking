    "selftext": "He posted this on \u201ctruth social\u201d today:\n\n> We pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason. We don\u2019t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use. Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada \u2014 AND NO TARIFFS!\n\n*(I am not linking because I know many subs are censoring links to \u201ctruth social\u201d and twitter. It will be the first result if you google it.)*\n\nIn summary, he asserts:\n1. That the US doesn\u2019t need Canada\n2. That Canada is on US-supplied life support\n3. That shutting down trade with Canada will kill the country and allow it to be annexed\n\nI assume this is why he is currently refusing phone calls from the Canadian government. He doesn\u2019t have demands for Canada. The demand *is* Canada. But *the question* is where this goes politically.\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nThe post I quoted has been removed from his Truth Social and Twitter account as of today (February 3rd). Now there is no posts about Canada dated from yesterday (February 2nd). Instead there is a post today hand-wavingly complaining about Canada not allowing US banks and not cooperating in the war on drugs.\n\nThe original post was on February 2nd, 8:26 a.m. eastern time. I\u2019m far from the only person with screenshots, but DM if you would like copies for corroboration.\n\nI checked to see if there was any media coverage of this post and/or its removal but I have found nothing. Even though I was notified to this post existing in other posts on Reddit, this apparently escaped the mainstream media\u2019s attention\u2026",

His idea of \u201csubsidize\u201d simply means we\u2019re buying more from Canada than they are from us, creating a trade imbalance. But that would seem to indicate they have lots of useful stuff that others around the world might want. And, this will be painful for the US Citizens. So, my guess, Canada just sits tight and waits for this to blow over. Then we hope this can be repaired in the future.",

I generally don't like to be alarmist, but the more I think about it, the more it seems like there's no good reason for him not cling to power. He already tried to have an election overturned and he was rewarded for it. Any sane nation would view January 6th as disqualifying, but we literally got together and voted him in again. \n\nThe message that the electorate sent was that they are A-okay with him ignoring democracy. There's really only two ways this ends. Either he actually does all the crazy shit he's threatening to do and we sit by and let it happen, or the people rise up against him and he declares martial law. Both options end with him seizing power the president was never meant to have. We're currently living in a [Kobayashi-maru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru) scenario",

They're malignant narcissists and the thought of what will happen in the world when they're no longer in it is probably not particularly interesting to them. That being said, he's got a whole host of people surrounding him that are helping to make his ambitions a reality. Hundreds of people worked on project 2025, and I'm sure any number of them would be happy to pick up the torch when he's gone. Whether or not they succeed without him is anyone's guess, but someone would surely try.\n\nAs far as how fast it happens, probably pretty fast. He's not going to want the midterms throwing a wrench in his plans again the way it did last time. If he were to do it, he'd probably do it before then. At this point I feel like the real goal is to enrage people to the point of rebellion, then using it as an excuse to declare a state of emergency.\n\nWe're seeing it happen in real time. His trade war just caused the biggest crypto crash in years, and that was two weeks after his meme-coin rug-pull crashed it a first time. He was supposed to be the crypto president. All the crypto bros were over the moon. He and Elon had them convinced they'd all be filthy rich by the end of the year, then he went and tanked the entire market. In case you don't follow these thing, the market crashed 30% in six hours. Trump and Musk are both money guys. Elon specifically is a crypto guy. They know damn well what happens to the market during times of global instability. It goes bye-bye in a matter of hours.\n\nThey knew this would happen. Many of their most ardent supporters just lost everything. They knew it would hurt their own people and they went ahead and did it anyway. He's also threatened to eradicate FEMA during a time in which millions of Americans are being effected by abnormally frequent natural disasters. And this isn't just happening in \"commie-fornia\", it's happening all over the country. Florida is arguably the Trumpiest Trump state and they're currently in full blown crisis because the increased frequency in hurricanes has led to insurance companies pulling out of the state left and right. He's not owning the libs, he's owning his own base. The question we need to be asking is why?",

Bitcoin is still sitting extremely close to its all-time high (about $109,000). This time last year, the highest Bitcoin had *ever been* was in the ballpark of $50,000. As of this morning, it is roughly $95,000.\n\nTwo other cryptos I watch are Ethereum and Litecoin, and they basically tell the same story. They both recently inflated in price, and they both have declined over the weekend, but remain at a higher price than they were last year, or at least are trading sideways.\n\n I guess a 30% crash might technically be correct, but I don't think it's an accurate way of discussing whether the crypto market is \"tanked.\" The market is in fact still up, mostly. \n\nThis is also true of the stock market, btw. For all the recent talk of crashes due to Deepseek, the market as a whole is still pretty close to its highest point. Whether this remains true this week as the tariffs/trade war intensifies, remains to be seen. \n\nI'm not arguing that we won't see any effects this week. I just think that your narrative about the effects of Trump *so far* on the crypto market (and relatedly stock market) is not quite accurate.",

He's got plenty of time to build a structure around him, especially if he finds a way to not leave office when his term is up. We need a better strategy than: \"Wait for him to die and hope that whoever takes up the MAGA mantle is less bad.\"",

If there's a crisis now, before people have fully felt the effects of his policies, he'll still have enough support to beat back the opposition.\n\nBut if the most forceful acts of defiance only happen after the populace is aware of what's happening to the country, the opposition will have a better chance of getting the nation on their side and neutering Trump's worst policies.\n\nWhat Trump's counting on is that he will have been able to consolidate enough power by then that popular support won't really matter.\n\nIt's all a very dangerous game.

George W Bush and 9/11 being false-flag.  I even believed the \"Bush knew the planes were coming and let them\" claim for a little while in my stupid youth.  Then onto Obama not being born in the US and similar \"low blows\".  It all ramped up in 2016 where if you believed EVERY accusation on the news, you'd end up in a mental asylum... despite the fact that most of those accusations against Trump were true!\n\nWe Americans, maybe we were lucky before, were not prepared for the tactic of a leader committing so many atrocities so regularly that any news reporting accurately on him would read like deranged conspiracy theories.  Those Enquirer-like crazy newsmags sound downright sensible compared to a real reporting of Trump's last presidency.  Actually try to think about these headlines in a vacuum in a civilized country.  A constant parallel of country-crushing incompetence and country-crushing malice.  We had a president suggest people inject bleach into their veins, who put one of the world's experts on pandemics on his shit list, and who took security off said experts in hopes he gets assassinated.\n\nThe typical American voter are exhausted and avoid politics like it's the plague because they are convinced they can't believe anything they hear.  So they knee-jerk vote off shallow understandings of a subset of issues.  Please understand that very few people are walking around with MAGA hats here.\n\nI know several people who voted Trump in 2024.  You know what their reasons have been?  They think Biden did a bad job with the economy or that Harris attacked Christians (or better yet, I know one who voted Trump because he believed our local schools were installing litterboxes for furry students that identify as cats).  When asked about Trump's crimes, they look at you stupidly because they think you're wearing a tinfoil hat and spouting crazy talk.\n\nAmericans don't like authoritarianism as a whole.

I never like this take, and I hear it a lot here in the States, too.  \n\nWe are approaching a billion citizens in the US (give it 10 years).  Nobody is going to pass a \"bailout John Smith of 123 Main Street, Nowhere Indiana\" bill.  But despite still being neoliberal (relatively center-right) and kicking us progressives off the table, the Democratic party has spearheaded virtually every job plan and safety-net we've gotten or attempted in the last 50 years.  But (what you may not realize) is that Democrats have had votes to pass a bill without Republican support less than 1/3 of the time, and have conservatives in-party that will vote Republican anyway if the Democrats don't compromise with the far-right party.   It's not that nobody gives a damn, it's that very few people who give a damn are ever actually voted in.  When people who run on \"I will fuck my constituents\" gets 70-80% of the vote over someone who runs on \"I will help my constituents\", it's really not fair to say \"accurately feels that nobody gives a damn\".  They've voting either by knee-jerk or they consider other issues more important than \"the well being of my family and my neighbors\".  \n\nAnd that's their prerogative, but you elect the guy who says \"I promise to ban abortion and take away medicare\", don't be surprised when your state refuses to accept money from the ACA and you can't get health insurance.  The person you voted for *literally promised that*.\n\n> And i have seen both sides of the political divide, go more and more to the extremes\n\nI'd love your take on this.  Every European I know personally sees our progressives (and me) as \"center-left\".  I know Denmark is fairly unique on the immigration front, so I'll put that aside.  What other issues would you say rank&file democrats are \"extreme\" about?",

This is NOT maintainable, and allies cannot rely on the US with this current system. \n\n(gonna rant about US geopolitics now)\n\nIn my opinion, foreign policy needs to be directed away from the popular vote, and shift more towards a technocratic vote instead.\n\nForeign policy can be more impactful than domestic policy, it affects more people for a longer amount of time, and US presidents in particular has more unilateral power over it than any US or foreign politician has within the world.\n\nHowever, the average American doesn't really care about foreign policy, and doesn't consider it when voting for presidency. Despite the president having the *most* sway over the topic, presidents are typically voted for based on their domestic stance instead of their geopolitical stance.\n\nThis is why I'm the opinion that the US Senate should pick the secretary of state, separate from the presidency so that foreign policy can stay consistent and apolitical from domestic issues. The candidates can be chosen from a short list of recommended candidates, made up of nominees recommended by senators and the president. It can be done via simple approval vote, so that anyone who abstains won't be counted, and the vote can move forward quickly without obstruction.\n\nWhen most Americans don't consider world events within their range of concerns, it's better to let better-informed specialists to pick a candidate within a pool of experts to direct how national foreign policy is treated.\n\nBetween Trump, Obama, and Bush, we now have a reputation of flip flopping at the whim of every election. With geopolitics requiring decades of consistency, a president shouldn't have unilateral power based on domestic atmosphere. 2 year elections by the senate, with the ability of the Senate/president to call for a snap election anytime, would establish bipartisan foreign policy that can outlast a presidency. Both parties would understand that they might not retain a 51 majority in the upcoming sessions, therefore keeping SoS candidates widely liked across the aisle. Since all parties are typically in agreement to foreign policy, appointment votes should be as majoritarian as they are currently for secretary approvals.\n\nThis technically doesn't *require* a constitutional amendment. It would just require the president to cede some established power. While the president does have complete control over whom they appoint, the president *can* call for mock elections, in order for the senate to \"advise\" whom he should pick for SoS. The president wouldn't be obligated to follow the advice vote, but making it administrative policy could keep the tradition widely popular across presidencies to come.\n\nThis to me is the best way to handle foreign policy, as most Americans aren't equipped in understanding the steep impacts to geopolitics in the modern world.",

Trump's wildly unqualified nominations are getting confirmed by the Senate.\n\nEven if the president didn't nominate, but the Senate did, the party structure we have would make it effectively the same thing as the party leader would tell the party members in the Senate who to pick.\n\nIf the president picks someone that the Senate wouldn't choose themselves, the Senate could reject that nominee and say come back with someone more qualified.",

UK has, I believe, two hundred or so warheads for trident and each of these would be about the size of a dustbin - so some form of strike would be possible separately from Trident that also bypasses their air defenses.",

Between Trump, Obama, and Bush, we now have a reputation of flip flopping at the whim of every election.\n\n**This is why I'm the opinion that the US Senate should pick the secretary of state, separate from the presidency so that foreign policy can stay consistent and apolitical from domestic issues.** The candidates can be chosen from a short list of recommended candidates, made up of nominees recommended by senators, various department heads, and the president. It can be done via simple approval vote, so that anyone who abstains won't be counted, and the vote can move forward quickly without obstruction.\n\nWith geopolitics requiring decades of consistency, a president shouldn't have unilateral power based on 4-year long domestic atmospheres. The Secretary of State could be 2 year biannually elections by the senate, with the ability of the Senate/president to call for a snap election anytime. It would establish a bipartisan foreign position that can outlast presidential administrations. Both parties would understand *that they might not retain a 51 majority* in the upcoming midterms, which therefore justifies keeping SoS candidates widely liked across the aisle to outlast each Congressional session as well.\u00a0\n\n***This technically doesn't require a constitutional amendment***. It would just require the president to cede some established power. While the president does have complete control over whom they appoint, the president *can* call for mock elections, in order for the senate to \"advise\" whom he should pick for SoS. The president wouldn't be obligated to follow the advice vote, but making it administrative policy could make this tradition widely popular across future presidencies to come.\n\nThis to me is the best way to handle foreign policy, since most Americans aren't equipped in understanding the complex impacts to geopolitics in the modern world. The average American doesn't really care about foreign policy and doesn't consider it when voting for president. Despite the president having the *most* sway over the topic, presidents are chosen based for their domestic stance which has caused unpredictability for the US on the international stage. When most Americans don't consider world events within their range of concerns, it's better to let better-informed specialists to pick a candidate within a pool of experts to direct how foreign policy is addressed for long-term stratagem.",

And attempting to make any voluntary changes in structure is just asking for a Trump to ignore the system. Republicans in general have been playing constitutional hardball the past nearly 40 years and it\u2019s hard to imagine they would stop for the sake of stable foreign policy. \n\nThat said, the electoral college was intended, in effect, to establish what you are calling for - a technocratic president. The problem is that it now serves only as a bastard middle-man between a popular vote and the President and reflects incredible incoherence in political philosophy in our Constitution. Ironically, it is because of the electoral college that we even have President Trump in the first place, and President Trump is a perfect caricature of the founder\u2019s fears which motivated the electoral college system. \n\nI agree with you, the instability in the Executive office points to a need for change in how the President is selected. Either the President should be popularly elected, in which case Presidential power must be somewhat more restricted, the Presidency must be more stable in duration, and there needs to be some form of recall of the President to increase accountability. Or the electoral college needs to be strengthened to return to its original intent, largely by getting rid of the popular vote and reduce the ability to campaign for office.",

It\u2019s like he wants to emulate Putin in territorial expansion, while also following h\u00a1tlers playbook, at the behest of Elon. \n\nThe best way to break us down and take control over any population is to get them to fight amongst one another, so they\u2019re too busy infighting, to bother against the real evil\u2026 Canada and US will have the trade war. Within the US he\u2019s sowing division (rather, *trying*) against immigrants, using inhuman and derogatory language in an attempt to separate - and make us feel like it\u2019s us v them. But, so far, there has been rather large pushback, with protests and organized push to buy from minority communities to show support. \n\nThe retaliatory tariffs are at least *targeted* to hit what\u2019s near and dear to Republicans - and specifically at red states. So, hopefully that makes a strategic dent. \n\nI know most Americans have short memories, but I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019ll be forgetting about the financial struggles they\u2019ll be facing the next few weeks and months (or years?). And I can\u2019t imagine any American being happy to be sent (or loved ones sent) to take over our neighboring country. So many Americans are sick of constant war. And the idea that shitler would possibly invade Canada for some imagined fentanyl border nonsense wouldn\u2019t have support. \n\nIt\u2019s only been 12 days. I can\u2019t see constituents standing for the inflation and tariffs messing with their daily livelihood, and standing idly by. \n\nAll he\u2019s really doing is making America isolated and weaker by alienating us from our allies. We may be a superpower now, but this trade war will push Mexico and Canada to buy from other sources, and essentially forget our number, as it were. He\u2019s pushing China into a far better chance of emerging as *the* super power. \n\n12 days, and his ego and narcissistic tendencies have eroded so much that this country has stood for, and relationships long established. *twelve days*\u2026",

            "body": "There are a few possibilities:\n\n* Trump is obviously bluffing about Canada being a state. As we know with Greenland, he says bombastic threats with the goal of scaring you into surrendering. Unfortunately, it only works with your permission. He's going to try to get some \"major concession\" like 1% more spending on border security or some garbage. He'll say \"Hey it worked! We got something!\" completely ignoring the damage he did to our own economy and the damage he did to our alliances.\n\n* Trump is serious and is possibly being manipulated into invading Canada by Putin. It would force America to stop supporting Ukraine and permanently damage the US's status as a global hegemony. Trump can die in five years feeling good about expanding America's borders, but having 40 million people involuntarily conscripted into your country would be devastating no matter how you implement it. \n\n* Kevin O Leary convinced Trump that he can somehow goad Trudeau into signing some treaty to make Canada a part of the US. Trump would have to be a complete idiot to believe theres any chance of that. But...\n\n* This is all just eye candy. There is a much larger scandal (possibly something to do with Elon Musk, a bunch of hard drives, and the software containing all of our tax dollars) that he is trying to distract us from. Donald Trump's main MO is to constantly stir panic and division. Keep us distracted and fighting within ourselves while he runs some huge crime\n\n* Trump is counting on these tariffs being here for the long term. He needs to justify them in the short term, so he's making demands like annexation that have zero chance of manifesting. This means that he never backs down from tariffs, and he justify a bill to replace the income tax with tariffs permanently. In Trump's mind, this would be his magnum opus. And in this might be the one he realistically wants. The main problem is that I have minimal faith in Trump/the GOP's ability to pass a huge bill like that. They passed one(1) meaningful bill in his first term and it was a milquetoast tax cut and he had a larger majority in both houses. This Bill is DOA and Trump knows it, hence the EO",

Sometimes these types of things will be lumped together, but since he had a majority in both houses, he did them one by one. Possibly to inflate his numbers, but I don't hate the methodology. \n\nHis main goal was to get funding for the wall and to replace Obamacare. He made an unsuccessful attempt at repealing Obamacare - he never had a plan for healthcare and he still doesn't. He funded the wall through emergency EOs mostly, which Biden easily overwrote.",

Canada has friends too, and the rest of the western world isn't going to let a bully just start grabbing territory after eerily repeating the same Fascist Playbook. European countries have a much higher level of respect for the mistakes of the past, and aren't going to let an ally drown after Nazi Germany. Canada would likely get the support of Mexico + Central & South America. Maybe Trump would ally us with Russia to make this a global conflict? Would be batshit insane but at this point nothing is off the table.\n\nIf the military pushes back, I think we get a massive, internal civil war inside the government. Our military is supposed to serve the Constitution above all else, and if this happens we're going to see some real fighting between the MAGA regime and our loyal service members (that value that commitment, anyways). It would dismantle our entire system of checks and balances, and the new process would entirely depend on the victor.\n\nTLDR: Nothing good",

Also just the distance from Europe and the proximity to the US. It effectively would be fighting on home soil for the US with respect to the rest of NATO. Not to mention, the US would have automatic air superiority over Canada. Their airspace for both countries is under NORAD.\n\nYou\u2019re right. What would happen after is NATO would draw a line in the sand and maybe fortify Mexico. Their response would be the subsequent isolation of the US and probably the explicit intention to second strike the US with nukes if necessary.\n\nI do think a number of these complications are why they want to do this economically, not militarily. But the problem is that\u2019s not really enough of a difference. A takeover by force is a takeover by force.\n\nI don\u2019t think a trade war will collapse Canada, so hopefully Trump never tries to go full on Hitler and this stays theoretical.",

It is said that the only country that truly won anything from the War of 1812 was Canada, which defended its territory against American invasion several times.\n\nEven after the War of 1812, the U.S. and Canada continued to have issues (mainly as a proxy for U.S.-UK conflicts) over things like water rights, fishing rights, oil/gas rights, etc. For the most part, we finally put aside most of this enmity after WWI. However it is not an uncommon occurrence for a Canadian PM to have harsh words for American POTUS\u2019s on various topics, the most famous one being PM Pierre Trudeau\u2019s famous dis of Nixon during the Vietnam War. Trudeau, who opposed the war and was open about allowing Americans to escape the draft and come to Canada, was insulted by Nixon, at which point he replied, \u201cwell I have been called worse things by far better people.\u201d\n\nAll this is to say that Canadians already know what\u2019s up and they are ready. It is we Americans who are asleep at the wheel, high on Oreos, football and gambling. We are a fat, lazy and stupid people and the rest of the world no longer takes us seriously.

That almost sounds like a difference without a distinction, but there are situations where the difference matters.\n2. We\u2019re talking about economic actions, not conventional military ones. While a NATO nation could activate article 5 over economic warfare, Canada probably wouldn\u2019t for a trade war. Calling in military support would only escalate the situation and the issue with a trade war is not enough trade with alternate partners. The most reasonable Canadian response would simply be to reduce its economic exposure to the US. The less that gets sent to a country, the less its tariffs matter.\n\nIf Trump turns out to be serious about annexation, it\u2019s possible that tariffs failing to do enough would trigger him to invade, but no one thinks the rest of NATO could stop the US on its own border even if they had years of lead time to prepare. NATO would have to play a long term game of quarantining and isolating the US. in this hypothetical. The most credible source of military opposition in this scenario would be a civil war in the US.\n\nI strongly suspect this unlikely, if for no other reason, because an invasion of Canada would implode the US stock market and wipe out a lot of rich people\u2019s wealth.",

Many will say they\u2019re against this or that guy because they don\u2019t want a dictator in the White House but the things they demand of their guy and the things they\u2019re scared of the other guy doing shows they already accept the idea of a president with dictatorial powers\u2026they just don\u2019t know it. And that\u2019s why so many people have had a conniption fit over the elections, like it\u2019s the end of the world, because it is for them. From their view, one person can do just about anything with only some speed bumps from the courts and cheerleading from Congress.\n\nBut it\u2019s not surprising. More than a third of voting aged adults in the US can\u2019t name all branches of government and 1 in 5 (so most of that third) can\u2019t name any branches at all. The idea that the public would just assume the most visible person has all the power shouldn\u2019t be a big leap for a public that is profoundly unqualified to elect its own government. This is also why Congress has increasingly stopped doing its job and let the president take over. The public doesn\u2019t punish them for it. Hell, many people don\u2019t even vote bellow the presidential ballot line.",

I mean if Canada couldn\u2019t figure out how to support themselves and work their way up the power ladder then they only really have two choices USA or china at this point. They\u2019re basically a Chinese colony right now and you heard Trudeau speeches how he admires Xi Jinping. I know a lot of Canadians that would be on board with Canada becoming American and I don\u2019t know anyone that wants to live under a communist dictatorship like china. There\u2019s a lot of people that have Marxist views but they don\u2019t actually understand what that is.",

The closest you could get to that is pointing to Chinese magnates owning Canadian unoccupied homes (especially in and around Vancouver) as a way to shelter money from the CCP.\n2. This idea is in direct contradiction with Trump\u2019s belief/assertion that the US subsidizes the Canadian nation\u2019s existence. That would make it basically a US colony. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\n\n> I know a lot of Canadians that would be on board with Canada becoming American\n\nAre you a propaganda spigot? Because nearly all Canadians, even in the most conservative provinces, are wildly opposed to this\u2026",
