Meanwhile, misconduct in one state can bar you from being licensed in another, eliminating the 'Move to Florida' loophole for bad cops. \n\nThe problem with degrees is that degrees have very variable quality to them, which is why things like the NCLEX exist for Nurses to set national standards. I don't think that policing should be some high-education career, either - we need more cops to physically manage people, firearms use and unsafe restraint techniques come largely from a lack of manpower in the field.",

If we make teachers carry professional liability insurance (generally just part of the union), we should also make cops carry policies and cities should never be on the hook for misconduct payouts. The current indemnification policies put cities on the side of bad police instead of on the side of citizens.\n\nIn some cities, a large portion of payouts for use of force or similar claims land on a small number of officers - I'd expect those officers to become uninsurable pretty fast. If not, at least there should be some communication within the union \"we're raising dues because officers X, Y, and Z can't follow the rules and our cost of insurance is going up\". https://news.wttw.com/2024/08/12/repeated-police-misconduct-200-officers-cost-chicago-taxpayers-1643m-over-5-years CPD has around 12000 officers.\n\nLicensing that requires some basic competence, especially around justification of force, but also about the laws that one might be expected to enforce and things that they may not like but are actually legal.",

Cops are not included.\n\nAccountants, acupuncturists, architects, engineers, social workers, doctors, nurses and nurse practitioners, basically any job that requires truly certified standards and can be revoked for the same. The only group not here are Attorneys, which have a separate system you can also look up.\n\nCops don't fall under this, once they take the POST it's more like a degree and it can't be revoked. Licenses are revocable and independent of your job. You can be a nurse and be fired but never lose your license, or never be fired but get a license action that prevents you from working.\n\nLots of the issue with police misconduct is that unions protect cops from being fired, but license boards can strip cops of their ability to be one without the job having any say. Same story with bad nurses, bad accountants, whatever.",

As has been shown with other aspects of policing (IE Alpert\u2019s now-ancient research into pursuits), **having a degree is not the determining factor**, age is.   \n\nMandating a degree is just an easy way to ensure that you\u2019re getting older officers without explicitly saying that that\u2019s what you want by changing the minimum age to apply and be certified. If you set the minimum age to 23 or even 25 (without implementing a degree requirement) you\u2019d see the exact same results attributed to having a degree in those studies.   \n\nAs far as your reason for prioritizing degree holders, no. They do so because they\u2019re ordered to for PR reasons and PR reasons alone.",

In other words do the ones who go straight from high school to a police department eventually grow out of it, or once they're in they'll always be more likely to offend?\n\nAn associates degree is just a 2 year program so i'd expect the degree requirement you're replying to would only take people to 20 rather than 23 or 25. Does the age impact show up if you said \"must be 21\" or does it need to go later for the age requirement to have the same impact as the degree?",

Making someone get a degree does not give them common sense, it does not fix issues with registering consequences, etc. A 21 YO with 3 years on is just as likely to do something stupid as the brand new 21 YO with a degree because the degree does nothing as far as addressing the mental development issues.\n\n> Without using age, are there good ways to screen for the necessary temperament that usually comes with age?  \n\n\nNot that I am aware of.",

This equates to a %0.00197 chance of a police-citizen interaction ending in a fatality, a chance which is orders of magnitude smaller than, say, [your chances of dying in the hospital due to a medical error.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28186008/)\n\nThat's not even considering that the vast, vast majority of police uses of lethal force are justified, which would make the chances of you dying due to an unjustified use of force so infinitesimally small that you legitimately have a *higher chance of winning the lottery.*\n\nThe reason you have this perception that cops are less disciplined in this regard is because the national news shows nearly every instance of police failing, since nearly every cop wears a body camera or is otherwise recorded. If every military member was recorded in the same way in a warzone, your opinion would be radically different.\n\nAnecdotally, a large percentage of really terrible cop behavior comes precisely from former military members.

What would be better is a degree in social work, psychology, etc.  Too many cops think they are heros and come in guns blazing.  That's why we have the horrendous track record we have in this country. Cops are trained (literally) to lie.  They are taught to write reports a certain way and to leave out certain details to make themselves look better in court.  They spend more time training how to fight and shoot, then they need, and ZERO time training on deescalation, mental health, and public relations and management.  \n\nI began my journey to leave the police force when I realized the criminals we were arresting were better at calming the OFFICERS and deescalating the situation then the officers were.  Cops are arrogant, power hungry assholes for the most part.  Take it from me, I worked with them for 14 years.",
