    "selftext": "In the 2024 election, many Muslims and Arab Americans abandoned the Democrats, or at least Kamala Harris, mostly due to the US government sending aid to Israel. This actually wasn't the first time they did this-the two abandoned the Republicans, who they up until then backed by a decent amount, following Bush's invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq (though who knows if they don't come back to the Dems as long as they didn't to the GOP). At least a few openly acknowledged Trump was worse in regards to Gaza or didn't care and still stayed home, backed Stein, or switched to him-most cited just the Gaza response, but at least a couple had their opinion set in stone due to Liz Cheney campaigning with Harris, either way deciding Trump was now the least bad choice or that both candidates didn't deserve their vote.\n\nSo, is there anything you think is in the realm of possibility that would cause you to not back your party or outright switch to the main opposing one? Or do you think there's nothing a single candidate in either one can slightly plausibly do to change your mind?",

Feels like a good chunk of \"moderate\" Republicans stayed home in 2020/22 or held their nose and voted for - at least surface-level - moderate Democrats. But they then went home for Trump largely because of the economy and Biden's unpopularity, in general. Harris tried to court them more than any Democrat since, what, Bill Clinton? It didn't work. So there's either a major disconnect between the \"old school\" Republican electeds and their voters, or the latter just stayed home. Either way, they were willing to roll the dice on a second Trump term. The Romney thing was telling. The guy is a vehement Trump opponent, had to spend millions out of pocket for private security so the crazies don't get him or his family, and kept speaking out against Trump during campaign season. And yet, officially endorsing Harris was a bridge too far, somehow. The mind boggles.\n\nThe main issue with old-school and establishment types is that they know they can't win without MAGA. This isn't a \"death of a party\" scenario at all - if they rebounded after Watergate, they would've rebounded after a '24 loss. But both the rank-and-file and officials seem to be okay with the abuse they've been getting from Trump as long as it means tax cuts, conservative judges, etc. There's an argument to be made that Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan wielded a ton of influence in Trump's first term, but I'm not sure you could say the same this time around, even though we're less than a month in. I guess we'll just have to wait til the midterms and see if \"moderates\" are starting to feel that.",

I don't really think this supports your original comment, which said that top officials lied about the vaccine being tested for stopping transmission and then trickle truthed the public. Accurate guidance had already been released. She deviated from the guidance and they corrected her. And I do think an important difference between Democrats and Republicans is that there was accurate guidance to direct people to and that she was publicly corrected. \n\nCompare this to Trump's [constant false statements](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/29/politics/fact-check-trump-coronavirus-pandemic-dishonesty/index.html) during the pandemic. See also [here](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fact-check-friday-trumps-coronavirus-response-plagued-misstatements/story?id=69590582). And the Republicans not only didn't walk back his various false and misleading claims, they in effect can't because they don't recognize any body as authoritative other than Trump. They have scapegoated and slandered scientific bodies, government agencies, and the press to such an extent that there is no one who can contradict him whom the base will believe. If the CDC or the press corrects Trump, they just blow it off.",

There is ZERO chance that any party will ever fight for all the things you want and fight against all the things you oppose. Vote for the candidate, not the party. Loyal partisans continuously find themselves obligated to support things they don't really believe in. \n\nBut I do like the way you phrased the question. NOT voting for Party D's candidate is a different choice than voting for Party R's candidate, no matter how hard the mindless partisans try to convince us otherwise. Our choice, as voters, is almost always: a) Vote for Party D's candidate; b) not vote at all; c) vote for a third-party candidate; or d) Vote for Party R's candidate.",
