    "selftext": "Many progressives argue we\u2019re facing a constitutional crisis, citing actions like:  \n- Attempts to dismantle or reorganize independent agencies (e.g., efforts to dissolve USAID) without congressional approval.  \n- Using broad \u201cnational emergency\u201d declarations to sidestep budget oversight.  \nThese moves have drawn little resistance from a Republican-led Congress.  \n\n**To counter this, what would a successful mass protest look like?**  \n1. What\u2019s the minimum turnout needed for a march on Washington to pressure lawmakers? Are there historical benchmarks (e.g., the 1963 March on Washington\u2019s 250,000+ attendees) that signal effectiveness?  \n2. What lessons from past movements\u2014like the Selma marches\u2019 focus on media narratives or the 1963 march\u2019s coalition-building\u2014could ensure protests lead to policy change? How can organizers maintain momentum beyond a single event?  \n\nIn your view, what practical steps could turn public outrage into legislative action?  \n",

A third of the population participated and the country ground to a halt.\nAfter two weeks starvation started in the cities, because food wasn't moved. But the people of Paris were willing to make the sacrifice.\n\nDe Gaulle had fled to Germany and rallied the army to his cause. When the army started moving towards Paris, the workers gave up and strike ended. There were some minor reforms in favour of the workers, but no political changes.\nDe Gaulle stayed in power for another year and retired due to old age. The conservatives remained in control of the government till 1978.\n\nAll resistance movements depend on the army. The army chooses who wins.",

The left just keeps romanticizing protesting so much that they skip steps.

It\u2019s like the environmentalists thinking they are helping the cause by shutting down traffic or damaging historic landmarks, but in effect they are anti-environmentalists for doing harm to the cause by greatly turning public sentiment against it.\n\nThe last step is just as important because the protest needs to END.  Don\u2019t overstay your welcome and protest to ad nauseam like OWS did.  You have a solid message, protest to get that message seen/heard, and then you bring that energy home to organize a political movement bringing about actual change.  Challenge the other side\u2019s incumbents or primary challenge your own.  The tea party did this quite well and their political momentum was absorbed into the Republican Party where that influence couldn\u2019t be more obvious today.",

But you make a good point. There isn't much anyone can do without risking being smeared by the media. Especially if whatever happens looks like it might work. So my question is: What is a realistic way to take control of the media away from the oligarchs? Or what would it take for enough people to stip believing the oligarch owned media altogether? Is there a realistic way to do one of these things while also preserving democracy and promoting freedom for the masses?",

In point of fact, the actual literature by participants available for survey paint a picture of camps that more or less had things under control until police violence made it impossible to maintain the camps.\u2020 But what actually happened at the camps? It was a 24 hour effort to feed, clothe, and shelter each other while still taking the time come up with demands and plans for integration of horizontal decision making processes, and how to take them back to their communities. \n\nCouple this with the constant need to get the 200-1000 new people showing up every day on board with the process, all with their own ideas, and it starts to become clear just how substantial of an effort this was.\n\nDo you know how many protests since then have tried to replicate the turnout without the radical element, and actually failed? At least a dozen a year. Even here on Reddit, in the wake of the Snowden revelations, you had people trying to organize a protest in response, and the undertone was \"we're gonna show those Occupy losers how it's done!\" This shit was promoted all across Reddit, and the turnout was weak, and the movement forgotten by next year.\n\nOccupy never left the news cycle for the duration of it's 3 month existence. (Let time frame sink in for a bit; **3 months of sustained action**; this is a logistical and organizational feat.) It coined and popularized the idea of \"the 99% vs 1%\". **It is the single largest non-violent movement in American history**.\n\n\"We only ever joke about the failures of Occupy\" is one hell of an indictment about the level of curiosity and engagement here! If the only lessons you can draw from Occupy about it's perceived failure as understood by people who never partook, and not investigate it's real successes as understood by the people who were a part of it, you'll only ever get half the picture. I couldn't imagine taking a position on something so strongly without at least investigating theperceptions of people within the process.\n\n\u2020\u2014 A narrative of \"Occupy was a failure\" seems to fall flat on its face when we consider the camps only broke apart because of coordinated police violence; people didn't turn to each other and say \"this democracy shit just isn't working\" and bail on the protests.

I think the problem here is that OWS isn't engaged with on its own terms\u2014 instead of asking \"what were they working on internally, what were the conversations like, what did they understand the goal to be\", it presumes that the movement had specific tangible goals which would be legible to the political mainstream, instead of operating from its own assumptions about political power.\n\nThe problem with people looking in on Occupy is that they take it for granted that no real radical options are on the table; at best, we can hope for some modest tinkering with policy, but our current benighted state of affairs is inescapable and inevitable. Those who see Occupy as being an event from which positive lessons can be taken *do not* accept or believe in these pessimistic assumptions as being wholly rooted in the fundamental fabric of reality.\n\n3.)

I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve got a hard on at the prospect of getting Milley, though if I were them, I would want to take Milley alive. Bolton was probably less useful with the change in administrations, but Milley\u2026.. different story. Honestly kind of hoping that as the four star generals get dismissed and not granted a Secret Service detail, some of the remaining four star generals will coup before they are all gone to ensure the survival of the military as an institution. They are NOT going to like taking orders from a SecDef like this one. They FAR outrank him and he\u2019s a pos. He was part of the unit that got called for J6 and even his commander told him not to come. I don\u2019t even mess with the military all like that, but a four star general who was trained to be apolitical would be better at this point, I think.",

Then you need at least 3.5% of people to actively go out and demonstrate for days, weeks or even months. This level of demonstration effectively works as a general strike and grinds entire cities and economies to a halt. The factory owner can't produce their goods if their workforce and everyone in the supply chain is in the streets protesting. Good luck controlling crime if your entire police force is dedicated to beating protesters in the square.  At that point it becomes very clear that the regime no longer has popular support and they can no longer control their country. Suddenly power players turning on them becomes far more likely and international pressure becomes far more dangerous.\n\nCould this work in the US? Probably. The problem though is that Americans voted for Donald Trump. If a clear majority opposed him and was willing to vote for his competitors then he wouldn't be president. Getting 10 million Americans to protest and protest consistently is also unlikely to happen.",

In all the states I've looked at it has not even been anywhere close.\n\nAs it stands, as long as the only response by our leaders is strongly worded letters and standing outside the locked doors of our institutions as they are gutted from the inside out, there's no hope for change. \n\nIt's not the Democrats that have to be given the message, it's the people doing this.

The old system stays as a fa\u00e7ade while real power shifts to private networks. The goal is for the state to become a temporary interface, a shell company for network states run by billionaires. Then, the nation-states dissolve into corporate archipelagos, where citizenship is a subscription model. This is quite literally tech-bro 101 and it's what Vance, Musk, Thiel, and Yarvin want. America completely gone and democracy a relic of human history. Bitcoin to replace the US Dollar. You think billionaires like being beholden to governments? No! And now they've bought an American election and the Congress and Supreme Court too. Congressional Republicans think they will be able to keep power over the network states, but they are mistaken. The only way to stop it? A counter-coup by the military or the bureaucracy or the people.\n\n  \nThe Constitution died and American people lost their rights the moment Elon took over the Treasury and nothing happened to hold him to justice (not to mention Trump's attacks on the Constitution). Our finances are leaked and our national security (with USAID and an alcoholic SECDEF) is compromised. The media and both Chambers and political parties of Congress and the Supreme Court are entirely complicit. Where is our democracy?",

They have built an alternate universe that is completely dissociated from reality itself, and they have used it to gain political power. But in actual governance, the reality where democrats have lived in will have no choice to assert itself. \n\n[This is how we got here.](https://open.substack.com/pub/edgarabrown/p/how-did-we-get-here?r=4ply6p&utm_medium=ios)\n\nInform, educate, organize, multiply, act.

Insanity is to keep doing the same thing that doesn\u2019t work over and over again, expecting different outcomes. They are in a cult, cult deprogramming is a stablished part of psychology and sociology, this is not new. Not even the scale of it is new. \n\nArgumentation is not the only communication tool we have. By understanding how they think, we can work within their own frame of understanding and make them argue with themselves. They are filled with cognitive dissonances, when cognitive dissonances are triggered it results in anger towards who they perceive as the source. \n\nWe have been useful foils for that anger, by not understanding the reality of how the mind works. We have the tools to trigger those cognitive dissonances, but to direct it at themselves and each other. \n\nWe have to be proactive in informing and educating on how to deal with the situation and do it as fast as possible.

You need philosophical training to be able to tease the subtleties apart. But those of us that can see it, it will be reflected in the way we use language. I am very careful with my words.\n\nSuffice it so say that reality is playing out exactly as I expected it to after the election, the only thing that surprised me is how incompetently stupid they are. And hilariously so. What I expected would take at least a year to unfold they are doing in a month, that's not a sign of strength but of weakness. They don't have the luxury to draw it out before we catch up to them, and that will accelerate their undoing.\n\nRead back what I wrote and note that I made a clear distinction between \"political reality\" and reality itself. Political reality lives in the universe of stories, with Mickie Mouse and Harry Potter, it can be anything it wants to be as long as people buy into the bullshit. But reality is the reality of the kitchen table, of eggs, guacamole, lumber, healthcare, housing prices, the actual reality we all live in.\n\nRepublicans have been much more in tune with the political reality than democrats have been, not because they don't understand it, not because they are delusional, but because they don't have the tools to counteract it. Truth is a much harder concept to get through than misinformation and lies. You cannot use the same toolset that Republicans use, you cannot play in the same field because they have a rigged game and you will always lose.\n\nYou have to change the game, look at the big picture and exploit the many situations in which reality becomes uncontroversial and can be used, by itself, as an education tool. Yes, they are stupid, ignorant, misinformed, delusional, etc. but that can be addressed with education and the proper psychological tools. We are the vast majority, and the GOP knows it, the oligarchs know it, that's why they want to keep us divided squabbling with each other.\n\nBe advised that, although this might sound as a regular argument to you, that's not what I am doing. I am testing hypotheses, trying ideas, examining how you think. So far I have been giving you the benefit of the doubt, but that might change at any point.\n\n>Hanlon's Razor: Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\n\nSo show some respect and don't be ordering me about what to do or not do.",

You need to understand that these are real people, find out why they believe what they do, acknowledge that their root feelings (fear) are valid, and show them why they don\u2019t need to be afraid of your side.\n\n\u201cYeah, I hear you. You feel that abortion is killing babies and you know what, I get that. I have a kid myself and I could never imagine living life without them. Unfortunately my sister did have to have an abortion herself. She had her nursery all set up and was already applying to the best daycares. She loved that kid more than she loved me, and he wasn\u2019t even born yet. If she had given birth though, she\u2019d be six feet under right now. Her kid too. She\u2019s been going to therapy which definitely helps, but she can\u2019t even be near other babies still. It hurts too much.\u201d\n\nIn that paragraph, you acknowledged the fear the other person has, empathized and let them know that you understand why they believe what they do. You even let them know you feel those same concerns too. That helps get on an even playing field, where both of you are being emotionally vulnerable and open with each other. Then you give a real life example of someone who was just like them but had to make that tough choice. You showed that it had an impact on them, and that they did have to deal with all the things this person is worried about. But you did it in an accessible way that helped them see that you aren\u2019t the cold hearted baby killer they see the left as. And you did it in a way that brought them along for the journey instead of alienating them.",

But today we have the internet and social media. You couldn\u2019t avoid these issues if you tried, the attention is already there.\n\nInstead of focusing on awareness, movements should start focusing on persuasion. Finding ways to convince the right that your way is better, or at least be open to an alternative. This means actually learning what they believe and why, treating them as fellow humans with different ideas instead of evil monsters, and finding inroads to get them actively listening to your potential solutions.\n\nNote that this is a lot more effective at a local level than national. Get involved with the community and win them over. The days of blocking streets and riling people up are over. Or at least those tactics being effective is over. When someone already knows the issue and has formulated a position, you blocking them from getting to work isn\u2019t going to do anything other than piss them off.

I've got to admit, Musk is mostly right about agency's waste\u00a0\nIt would be fair to say that USAID is a baby suffering in filthy bathwater that hasn\u2019t been cleaned for decades\nBy\u00a0Rob Cohen, M.D.\u00a0\u00a0Fox News\u201d",

This is what the Republicans in all branches have been working towards -- it's a coup of the US Constitution by any standard. The old system stays as a fa\u00e7ade while real power shifts to private networks. The goal is for the state to become a temporary interface, a shell company for network states run by billionaires. Then, the nation-states dissolve into corporate archipelagos, where citizenship is a subscription model. This is quite literally tech-bro 101 and it's what Vance, Musk, Thiel, and Yarvin want. America completely gone and democracy a relic of human history. Bitcoin to replace the US Dollar. You think billionaires like being beholden to governments? No! And now they've bought an American election and the Congress and Supreme Court too. Congressional Republicans think they will be able to keep power over the network states, but they are mistaken. The only way to stop it? A counter-coup by the military or the bureaucracy or the people.\n\n  \nThe Constitution died and American people lost their rights the moment Elon took over the Treasury and nothing happened to hold him to justice (not to mention Trump's attacks on the Constitution). Our finances are leaked and our national security (with USAID and an alcoholic SECDEF) is compromised. The media and both Chambers and political parties of Congress and the Supreme Court are entirely complicit. Where is our democracy?",
