Wes Moore is a young, effective governor who has the ability to reach a male electorate focused on strength and image much more than Pete's experience and communication.  \n\nWes Moore represents what's good about the democratic party, isn't afraid of a fight, is capable of speaking authentically without first checking with a focus group, and is far more capable of inspiring a coalition of voters exhausted and hurt, literally, by Trump while focusing on the economy and jobs and taking a step back from cultural issues and other areas the democrats are out of step with the modern electorate realities.\n\nA strong, populist message with historic economic promises, delivered by a jacked, football playing strongman who isn't toxic in his masculinity but still conveys masculinity in a way the bros are seeking, who happens to be capable of speaking authentically and effectively to things of actual concern to Americans would walk into a general election matchup in a stronger position than any other democrat.\n\nDouble down on the new democrats by pairing him with Andy Beshear or Jon Ossoff and print this ticket fucking out and tell me where to send my money.\n\nIf democrats don't look at the election results and come away with a view that they are out of step with American voters who only care about the economy and pocketbook issues, stand for nothing, need a spine, and go big with ideas than we are doomed forever and may as well give up this resistance just as it begins.\n\nOf course there's probably not going to be another election, so...",

By the time the primaries happened, pundits on fox News would be calling her a whiny bitch loser.

After 2016, there were umpteen celebrities bandied about as the Anti-Trump and I was aghast. As a person who had always been politically engaged I fundamentally rejected the idea of a celebrity president and balked at the idea of the Democrats following the lead of the GOP. I\u2019ve completely changed my view. What has become clear is that voters are tired of career politicians that have crafted a public persona that feels like bullshit. \n\nAs a result of this change in view, I\u2019ve been considering what celebrities might actually be capable of both winning and governing. My heart immediately goes to Jon Stewart but I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever even consider it. Most famous people don\u2019t have any credibility in terms of running anything, let alone a nation. I\u2019ve also been stuck on the way Americans equate money with acumen and I\u2019ve come to a single conclusion. Mark Cuban. He is as close to what Trump claims to be as someone can be. He was born working class and is as self-made as a billionaire can be. He also seems to be as ethical as a billionaire is capable of being as evidenced with his model for Cost Plus Drugs. He\u2019s on tv regularly and is widely respected for his business sense. He\u2019s also outspoken about his own political views, which may not be \u201cprogressive\u201d but are certainly left of center. The reality is that most Americans are not aligned with the far left. I don\u2019t accept the premise that democrats lose for not going far enough left but rather for not committing to big ideas with passion and sincerity. Universal healthcare, for example, is not a far left idea if presented in a common sense framework. \n\nIn short, Cuban 2028!",
