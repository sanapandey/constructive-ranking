Should this criticism be persuasive, or do you find it persuasive and why?",

We're deathly afraid of the idea that someone somewhere will use a public benefit when they do not 1000% deserve it. We would rather nobody have that nice thing than take that chance. \n\nWe don't need to give everyone free (at the point of care) healthcare in a vacuum. There are all kinds of public health initiatives we could and should implement not only to improve people's health outcomes but to also save money.",

With access to free healthcare, including early medical interventions and mental health support, much more expensive severe health problems could be avoided and even this individual's addiction could potentially be managed.\n\nWithout such support, the likelihood increases that this person could face bankruptcy, unemployment, or even homelessness, on the top of medical issues. These circumstances also affect their family, potentially leading to educational setbacks for their children, among other social issues\u2014costs that society ultimately bears.\n\nThe bottom line is clear: society pays either way. It's ironic that there is such resistance to providing \"free\" services upfront when, in the long run, the absence of these services leads to significantly higher costs due to compounded social and economic problems. This short-sightedness in policy-making overlooks the fact that free preventive care is not only more humane but also far more cost-effective than facing the inevitable, substantial expenses later on.",

I say \"the market\" to mean stock market, housing market, vehicle market.\n\nThe Zestimate effect on the housing market is the perfect example. People spend so much time tracking the up and down of that fake number - that even selling at a healthy profit to them  can feel like a loss if its below the fictional peak.\n\nAdd to that, the fact that valuations the government tosses around  are largely fictional as well - how do you put a dollar value on military equipment that we will not use, but cannot sell on the open market.\n\nAt that point you could use anything as a metric - I vote we express things in a percentage of Elon Musks net worth. That might better help people understand these insanely large number. \n\nIn this case, our spending on ukraine would account to 14% of Elon Musks net worth. So if you make 100K a year - this amount of money to Elon Musk is essentially the value you would put on a small boat or RV. \n\nIts not like if we didn't give F-16's to Ukraine we could put them on Ebay for 10 million.",

It assumes a perfect world where nobody is actively trying to prevent people from assembling freely.\n\nYes, there's nothing *inherent* about the concept of free speech that absolutely requires peoples labour to uphold it, but in practice - in *reality* - it does require people's labour to uphold.\n\nWhen a company or organisation quashes people's free speech, lawyers, judges and government other employees are needed to stop that. If nobody worked those jobs, that human right would crumple and cease to be upheld.\n\nSo there's a conceptual difference between them, yes, but in real terms they both require labour to make happen. And I think the guy above was talking more about practicality than concepts.",

Evangelical Christians didn't used to care about abortion at all. And the NRA was for 200 years a gun safety and marksmanship outfit. All of that changed within the span of just a few years. \n\nRight after the civil rights and the women's liberation eras of the 1960s and 70s. Suddenly Republicans were against anything that might materially benefit average Americans\u2013because now that included *them*. Women could get their own credit cards, have jobs, and control their own fertility with the pill. Suddenly the evangelicals developed strong feelings about abortion. And with black people going anywhere white people could go (including your kids schools!) the NRA turned into a radical gun rights lobbying group. Gott keep the guns around in case the government starts upsetting the social order even more. (Tyranny!)\n\nThe modern Republican Party is nothing but a backlash against the progress of the 60s and 70s by blacks and women.",

My original comment was a response because I thought you were saying that anyone that doesn\u2019t want universal healthcare was because of African Americans, lgbtq, etc\u2026 in which I said that\u2019s not true because I\u2019m surrounded by people who think that\u2019s the best option or they don\u2019t want their medical field to be socialized. So I guess there was confusion on my end who is referring to people as them.\n\nWe probably aren\u2019t very far off from a viewpoint perspective. I guess I just threw my two cents in because I think the higher class wouldn\u2019t mind people thinking it\u2019s a race issue. If everyone is looking at it racially, nobody will be looking at them collecting a paycheck while the lower/middle class struggle.

It began in the 60s and reached the peak of government when Reagan declared that government \"is the problem.\" Then declared war on welfare queens. This is where it started and it is the underground well that the entire modern conservative movement draws from as its source of motivation. \n\nPerhaps you're familiar with Heather McGhee. If you're not, I encourage you to look her up. She's written a fantastic book called The Sum Of Us. She's got a good Ted talk about there, too. Check out her story about the public pools in America. The public pool is just like affordable healthcare. We could have it, but if we have to share it with our black neighbors, we'll just permanently fill it in so nobody will have it.",

I work in healthcare, and I've had students ask similar questions. \n\nTypically, it's with a patient who has a known history of opioid abuse and they are very skeptical about pain management in the patient, even when they have a very clear cause for the pain. I tell them that, while yes there are people that may be trying to get something they may not necessarily need at the moment, that skepticism can lead to not treating people who desperately need something. I tell them I err on the side that I'd give 100 people who don't necessarily need opioids for pain relief the drugs, to avoid not treating that one patient who does desperately need them.  \n\nIt's obviously way more complex than that in practice, due to safety concerns with medications and a variety of other components of the patient care process. But the reality of the situation is to do no harm, and to be humanistic about everything. Fear of people abusing help is generally a bit overblown as far as I'm aware, and you cause so much more suffering by not providing for the people who do desperately need it just because you're afraid of a couple people who don't need it getting a little extra support. Again I'm simplifying things a bit but I feel like this is a reasonable thought process for most people who want to genuinely help others.",

However, money is fungible. So the government's tech infrastructure upgrades to have things like Login.gov and other systems benefit not only Medicare but all other agencies. A private system has to account for all that spend.\n\nBut I challenge that there's another way to look at it too and it's quality of care. Why is Medicare on it's own basically not enough? Middle class and higher retirees generally all have some supplemental insurance in addition to Medicare. It's not because Medicare is great, but because it's simply insufficient in terms of care.\n\nPeople ignore the fact that Medicare on it's own is really just a bare bones safety net, especially before its expansion with Parts C thru D. In terms of basic care, yeah you get it from Medicare, but if you need more advanced care like treating cancer, and other more complex care, generally that's where you rely on supplemental or Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nSo maybe at some level Medicare is more efficient, but it's also very bare bones in coverage in that private insurance gets you the actual care you need. \n\nLet's take some of the top tier insurance that US employers offer. Tech workers who have all sorts of benefits like egg freezing, concierge care, etc. have hands down the best coverage that beats out European state care and even good European employers. You can argue it's less efficient, but no tech worker is going to trade for Medicare level coverage in the name of efficiency as an employment benefit instead.",

For example, privatized prisons gain efficiencies by dehumanizing prisoners, by putting as many in closely confined spaces as possible, in awful conditions, eating cheap food filled with sawdust, etc. They are more efficient but the outcome is cruel and unusual.\n\nOn the other hand, some efficiencies can be gained through economies of scale and outright purchasing power, i.e. the government is in a position to purchase in bulk in a way no single private organization is.\n\nFurther, profit-seeking may introduce inefficiencies in some systems by virtue of obstruction, planned obsolescence, or creating exploitable cascading effects such as is the case with the health insurance industry.",

Triage is only needed when resources are so tight that you can't meet all of the needs.\n\nOne challenge that I see is that people argue as if everything is a zero sum game. They've lost the ability to see when they're better off unless they're more better off than everybody else. (\"Either you're the biggest winner, or you're losing\" is a pervasive attitude.)",

The question is a moral question of whether you would stop the doctor from providing care because the injured individual didn't collect as much firewood or something.\n\nIt's not a question of scale or the structure of a healthcare system or anything like that, but again, the reluctance to engage with the hypothetical in good faith, as a few of you now have done, betrays your recognition of the moral quandary.\n\nI'd have more respect for this level of engagement if you simply said \"no, that person didn't pick as many berries as me, and they should be left to die.\" This would at least be a good faith disagreement.",

Their freedom definently allows them to refuse service. You either believe that the second some one is smart and useful, their labor is not their own or it is. You can not have an inalienable right to something that someone else has to perform for you. Your rights can not force some one else to action.\n\n>Now instead, imagine that the Doctor is willing and able to help, but someone steps in and says they are not allowed to help because the person injured didn't help pick as many berries as them, or gather as much firewood, or maybe they are just fat or something.\n\nThis is red herring. The central point of the argument is based on can the doctor refuse care. And the answer should be yes.\n\nDigging into this paragraph, though, and taking it out of the hypothetical, there is nothing stopping a doctor today from rendering care other than their own decision to do so. Doctors maybe contractually limited in how they render care based on the agreements they have signed with hospitals, insurance, or whatever. In those cases a doctor traded away their ability to provide care at certain rates or, in certain cases, in favor of whatever they are getting from the contract.",

            "body": "It's self-evident that those who live unhealthily put a disproportionate amount of strain on a universal healthcare system. But all human activity is inherently dangerous.\n\nWhere would one draw the line between responsible and irresponsible behaviours?\n\nWhat about recreational sports, for instance? They do contribute greatly to the individual's physical and mental health; but they also bear a greatly increased risk of injury.\n\nWhat if someone hurts themselves working out at the gym? Should the system have to pay the costs of their treatment if their training regimen went beyond the requirements of remaining healthy (i.e. if their training goals were purely aesthetical)?\n\nWhat if someone hurts themselves while on vacation? An individual's vacation can be interpreted as being beneficial to society, as a well-rested member of the workforce is more productive and contributes more to the economic output. But what if they decided to spent their annual vacation skiing? It's a dangerous activity, and a torn ligament is very expensive to heal.\n\nThe bottom line is, it seems to me that the argument in question is only superficially convincing. Every definition of a \"poor health choice\" would be entirely arbitrary. You could even make up excuses for heavy smokers: Surely, a chain-smoking stressed-out paramedic might warrant more leniency from society than some bored-out office worker?\n\nMoreover, many systems of universal healthcare implemented around the world do know some form of sanctioning for self-inflicted health issues. For example, in my home country UHC doesn't cover caries treatment if the insuree failed to see their dentist for bi-annual check-ups.\n\nIt is perfectly possible to reduce the cost burden posed by \"poor health choices\". One might even suggest it's an inbuilt option since universal healthcare is, by definition, an exercise in solidarity. And he who ruins his health in a grossly negligent fashion and expects society to pay up is clearly lacking in solidarity.",

If you can't afford the insurance then you can't drive anymore under our system and the problem is solved. Emergency services related to your reckless driving are effectively denied - if you need them again you're probably going to prison after you get them.\n\n\nThe same isn't true for smoking, and people feel it should be. That's the problem in the first place, you can't use smoking as a counterexample in the discussion about smoking.\n\n\nUsing emergency services is also a misdirection here, as emergency services are a separate thing from payment in the first place. The ambulance will still pick you up if you're a smoker, but if you can't afford insurance because smoking raised your rates to an unaffordable level then you'll be the one receiving that bill.\n\n\n>but universal healthcare follows the same principle\u2014everyone contributes so it\u2019s there when needed\n\n\nNo, that's not similar at all.

You're presuming healthcare and health insurance as a public service, when the argument is over whether it should be a public service in the first place. The concept being voiced is \"health insurance shouldn't be a public service because it spreads the cost of lack of personal responsibility, which encourages self harming behaviors and inflicts the harm onto others\" and your counterargument begins with \"healthcare is a public service so you get it even if you make poor choices.\" You're unable to engage on the level of what's being discussed.",

Insurance companies' ability to balance costs across large risk pools is exactly why universal healthcare works efficiently. In a universal system, the risk pool is the entire population - young, old, healthy, sick, smokers, non-smokers - which creates the most stable and efficient risk distribution possible. This is why every developed country with universal healthcare achieves better health outcomes at lower per-capita costs than our fragmented system.\n\nYou're focused on individual insurance companies maximizing profit, but healthcare as a public service operates under different incentives - maximizing public health while managing costs across the entire population. The economics of private insurance companies seeking profit actually demonstrates why a universal system would be more efficient at delivering care while containing costs.",

So if they'll let something that's addictive be legal and easily obtainable, then they should also provide healthcare to address the issues brought about by the availability of something harmful. There are about 600 ingredients in cigarettes and they create more than 7,000 chemicals.* At least 69 of these chemicals are known to cause cancer. But then the tobacco industry wouldn't feed into the medical/pharmaceutical industry, and they're both guaranteed revenue. Not to mention insurance companies. Why are we asked to spend so much on insurance when we may never need it, if you're abnormally lucky/healthy, that is. Or why pay so much in insurance when the co pay or final bill could wipe out any/all of your savings, which has happened to plenty of folks. Done everything 'right' only to have your medical bills ruin you? Just doesn't seem right.\n\n*This does not include American spirits. If you're gonna smoke, smoke those. Ingredients include tobacco, water, vegetable glycerin, menthol (in menthol varieties), natural flavors (in specialty blends), and peppercorn (in Perique blend). And tobacco is a natural thing, humans have been partaking for a long time, which I see no problem with. You could go your whole life not ever smoking one and you could still die of lung cancer.

This possibility always exists, but inversely, when government pulls too far away from regulation and oversight, oligarchy begins to form. I think this can be readily seen in many western countries, even though we are not quite there (edit: I say this as a measure of good faith, but Musk is unelected and is essentially controlling the US treasury), but regulation and oversight into American businesses and industry have drastically been relaxed and repealed since the Reagan era. I know there is this narrative from Musk right now about the invasive and prohibitive nature of regulations, but I think it should be clear that this is overstated from the perspective of someone who wants to shoot off rockets at will.\n\nI want to address something you said here, \"My biggest fear is that i have dealt with the DMV and the IRS as well so i have seen how badly government bureaucracy can destroy the concept of service...\"\n\nEfficiency is a catch 22. I would argue, and I think through investigation that it is clearly the case, that austerity has caused inefficiency within our public institutions. Greater efficiency has a higher upfront cost, but people seem to believe that an inefficient branch or institution is wasting money, and they cut budgets, causing this spiral of inefficiency and budget cuts due to perceived waste. It is apparent to me that austerity has caused many institutions to insufficiently serve the public because their budgets have not grown to meet the demand of our growing population.\n\nAnd instead of Medicare, observe systems like they have in Sweden, or Germany, or Italy. I believe Italy's private health insurance is about $1000 usd/yr that can be added to the public insurance everyone receives.

So the question is more \"do we want health insurance or not?\" (the government is vulnerable to the same quasi-ethical objection like that above).\n\nThat said, RFK Jr.'s response to Senator Sanders was a red herring. The status of health care as a human right (a Western liberal social construct) is not related to its cost or even whether it can be provided. It is either considered to be something one is entitled to in virtue of their humanity or it isn't. That has precisely nothing to do with the actions of others, beneficial or otherwise, impacting others.\n\nNot to say I don't get people's frustrations with corporate overreach and profit-mongering. Costs for health insurance might well go down if everyone were suddenly healthy, but that's the name of the game - your money goes to covering the cost of other sick people. You aren't the business, so you can only make the decision to buy in or not. You don't get to screen the candidates and pick the ones you like. To do otherwise would bias the system along the lines of a popularity contest. Simply put, the well-regulated business is more efficient and less biased than it would be if you got to tell the corporation exactly how to spend your money.",

The public defender thing is also due to affordability. I imagine if the founders knew what would happen to healthcare in this country, they would have included it.

Remember that there was no tax revenue for the federal government until the 20th century. I believe that tariffs were the only source of income for the federal government prior to that. \n\nYou made your life better. I have a similar story, but I can\u2019t say I grew up poor. We certainly weren\u2019t anywhere close to being rich. When I moved out?  Yeah, I was poor. That motivated me and likely you too. \n\nIt might sound harsh, but unskilled workers can become skilled.  Nobody is born skilled. You take a minimum wage job as a stepping stone. It cannot be expected to support a family or even an individual for long. If you watch a small child who wants to do things for themselves, even stubbornly at times, this gives a glimpse into what humans instinctively want and need. If we insist on providing things at zero cost or effort, it kills something inside people. Like I said, temporary safety nets are great. IMO, these should require something in return. It doesn\u2019t have to be much \u2014 maybe a little volunteer work or something. This allows people to keep some dignity and it doesn\u2019t kill that drive to make your life better. You and I know what that feels like and it is amazing. \n\nOf course, there are people who are simply and truly incapable. We have to take care of them, although I would argue that private organizations are more capable and far more efficient at this. I\u2019m still ok with some government help as well. If they really can\u2019t provide for themselves then they really can\u2019t. \n\nI was laid off just before my first child was born. I was able to scrape and borrow enough for COBRA coverage to get through the birth. After that, we took advantage of WIC and state health clinics for mother and baby. THAT was motivation!  I worked any job I could find until I landed an entry level job in manufacturing. It didn\u2019t pay much, but had modest benefits. I went to school at night. It was exhausting, but eventually I had enough credits that I could apply for a degreed position with my employer. It took a few tries, but I made it. Still wasn\u2019t rich. They required me to finish school, which I did. Gained experience and moved up the ladder and then I got laid off twice and divorced once in a two year period.  By then, there were four kids. Any father who complains about child support is an asshole. I fell two months behind, burned up my small 401k and a few thousand  left over from the sale of my house (this was just after the 2008 crash, so there really wasn\u2019t much) trying to stay afloat. That was 16 years ago. I\u2019ve been through three jobs with three employers in that time, improving my situation each time. It\u2019s been rough, but I was able to stop living paycheck to paycheck about 10 years ago. Two years ago I got a new job that came with a 40% raise. Kids are raised and I\u2019m trying to catch up on savings and retirement. \n\nI\u2019m not looking for praise here. My story is not unique. It certainly isn\u2019t  impressive compared to many. I also made mistakes and exercised poor judgement that contributed to my woes, but the motivation to take care of my kids and to do it myself was strong. I collected unemployment for a total of around a year and I am grateful for that. CHIP was a wonderful help for getting care for my kids, but it was always uncomfortable, as it should be for *most* people. \n\nI absolutely support having a  backstop or safety net, or whatever metaphor you want to use, but we can\u2019t just take away people\u2019s dignity and motivation to better themselves.",

This does not disappear because we support a public option.\n\nAnd I shouldn't have used the term \"low-skill\" but rather \"unskilled\". Unskilled labor is an integral part of our economy and workforce, and many of these workers make minimum wage. Even those starting at $15-$18/hr struggle to afford healthcare for their families. Premiums for single vs families go up from $150/month to $400/month.\n\nThis is how Reagan an neoliberals in general have shifted the tax burden onto the middle and working class. Things like sales tax that disproportionately affect middle and working class people, lower progressive taxes, the warping of anti-trust laws, the destruction of unions, have been shrinking the middleclass for the past 50 years.

In order to have comprehensive healthcare there needs to be a morality of healthcare individual responsibility. Some things are easy like smoking would certainly carry a penalty. We must think about personal care as how we respect others in society even those we never meet. We already require certain vaccinations in order to attend public school. Risky behavior looks different when you think about the burden on others that an accident would cause. It would certainly be beneficial to have healthcare for all primarily covered by government.

And wouldn't it be more simple and efficient if we made the \"pool\" all of America and then literally every doctor could be \"in network\"? And it will be cheaper since there wouldn't be a profit motive paid to some bloated middleman who serves no purpose besides arbitrarily denying coverage because of the aforementioned profit motive and a responsibility to ensure shareholder returns. \n\nAnd since it would drastically reduce healthcare costs, it would probably be very affordable, which we know because literally every single other developed country does it.",
