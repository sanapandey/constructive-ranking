            "body": "The tariffs are going to increase prices and lead to a stagnant economy. I wouldn't be surprised if we return to an economy similar the \"stagflation era\" that plagued the 1970s during the Carter administration except with a lot more civil unrest. I just don't see how adding a \"tax\" that makes certain goods from certain countries x% more expensive will bring prices down. The math literally doesn't math.\n\nTariffs are normally implemented when a country has a booming existing manufacturing base that it wants to protect from foreign competitors but they can't revive dead industries. It takes time to build industry. It is a huge multi year investment to build factories, design a supply chain, hire qualified workers, etc and it is no guarantee that any of this once up and running can be profitable in the long term.\n\nThe world is also much more globalized than it was back in the days that MAGA wants to return to. A Boeing 787 has its final assembly done in South Carolina but it has parts from 58 different countries from hundreds of different suppliers. Sure the US can try to make some of these parts in America but again, it takes time and money to get that up and running. Obviously this is an extreme example since a 787 is super complex but many \"Made in America things\" have some of its supply chain in other countries.\n\nAnother thing these tariffs fail to realize is there are simply some goods that just can't be \"made in America\" at the scale Americans demand them due to climate. Coffee, bananas, coconuts, avocados, etc. are all grown in more tropical climates. Sure some avocados are grown in California amd some coffee comes from Hawaii but not at the scale Americans demand.\n\nI just don't see how any way that implementing tariffs will \"Make America Great Again.\" Its just going to make shit more expensive and make us poorer.",

The quality might not be as good, but it's cheaper and more convenient.\n\nFor example, my wife used to do bookkeeping for a third party auto parts quality company.  One of the big auto makers would order a component, say a steering wheel, from a contractor in Mexico. When the shipment of steering wheels arrived, oh no, they used the wrong relay in the horn. So the company my wife worked for would hire a dozen temp employees to follow a three or four step procedure to remove this relay, replace with that relay, add a screw here, done.\n\nAnd to order the product, deal with importing and shipping and hiring a third party company to repair issues...was still cheaper than just having a union shop make it in the first place.",

The idea is that chaos, whether real or manufactured, creates widespread distress, which in turn makes people desperate for stability. This desperation can then be leveraged to introduce drastic changes that might not have been accepted under normal circumstances.\n\nHistorically, this kind of pattern has been used to justify major political shifts, economic overhauls, and even war. When people feel overwhelmed by instability, they become more willing to accept extreme solutions, even those that might otherwise seem unreasonable or authoritarian.\n\nSome possible intended outcomes of the chaos we\u2019re seeing could be:\n\t\n1.\tGreater Centralization of Power \u2013 Governments or corporations might use crises to justify increased surveillance, control, or restriction of freedoms (e.g., digital IDs, social credit systems).\n\t\n2.\tEconomic Restructuring \u2013 Financial instability can lead to calls for a new global financial system, whether it\u2019s central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) or wealth redistribution policies.\n\t\n3.\tCultural and Social Reengineering \u2013 Rapid shifts in societal norms can be implemented more easily when people feel unmoored from tradition or uncertain about the future.\n\t\n4.\tTechnocratic Rule \u2013 Crises might be used to justify placing more decision-making power into the hands of unelected experts, AI systems, or multinational institutions.\n\t\n5.\tWar and Military Expansion \u2013 Conflict can unify people under a common enemy, justify increased defense spending, or redirect attention away from internal problems.\n\nWho benefits from the chaos?

So when he sees these figures he instantly thinks \u201cnahhhh the other guys should pay the same\u201d \n\nEven if they make less and the dynamic between the countries is fine and nuanced.\n\nHe is taking a sledgehammer to these intricate relationship we have built on the backs of very bright and smart people, because he doesn\u2019t understand the nuance behind them.\n\nTrump is a very very dumb, egotistical moron with a very high confidence. That\u2019s how he operates, he isn\u2019t playing 4D chess, he\u2019s tricking you into thinking he is good at his job\u2026 which AGAIN! is all part of his snake oil salesman personality! \n\nWe all need to understand this or else we are gonna be very very confused and angry the next four years",

Also, prices didn't fall for consumers even after more US manufactured machines came available, because why would the prices fall? If the US companies can sell their products just slightly cheaper than the foreign imports and make more profit, of course they would do that. And that was just on ONE product. It'll take way longer to bounce back on EVERY import from your three biggest trading partners. You're about to see massive inflation, as well as America's bargaining power diminished globally.

We choose what to buy and spend our money on. The reason so many of these companies raise their prices so high is because we have no discipline and will buy no matter what. We HAVE to take responsibility in our part, continuing to give our money to companies with bad practices is the reason they are able to take advantage of us. This is our opportunity to change our habits. Buy the cheaper brands. Give to the companies who aren't out to screw us over (where we can, of course, I know there's not many of them). \n\nMaybe this is also the younger generation's opportunity to start some competing companies. If there's a market where you can produce a product and sell it for cheaper while still making a profit AND be cheaper than all of your competitors, now is your chance. Learn to not be as greedy as them.\n\nWe're all so reliant on others. The whole point of these tariffs is to turn that around. Unfortunately as a country and society we SUCK at that now. Why? Why do we rely on every one else to fix our problems? We as consumers have power too, you know. And it's about fucking time we start exercising that power. Seriously! Do a bit of research, find better brands and companies, talk to your neighbors, make friends, rely on each other's skills and abilities to make life work. We DO need to be better.

Moron brother voted for Trump and heard him last night complaining how his mandate nearly closed the school where his wife worked because abuse the school depended on government loans to meet their payroll. \n\nIt won\u2019t take long before the poor folks and the blind wake up to what they empowered to the presidency, Trump\u2019s failures that he continues to blame Biden for. Amazing he cannot take ownership for any failed policy. Come on blind people WAKE UP! \n\nI\u2019ve not agreed with everything Biden has done. But i do respect and thank him for serving others for 50 years. Trump has no respect for the office. Trump is a man who puts down others to elevate himself. SAD",

Boosting U.S. Manufacturing by encouraging companies to bring production back to the states.\n2. Strengthened National Security by reducing dependence on foreign supply chains.\n3. Lowered Trade Deficits by shifting reliance from imports to domestic products.\n4. Promotes Fair Trade by making countries compete. \n5. Increased Revenue. Tariff income will fund federal initiatives.\n6. Force Innovation to stay competitive.\n\nIn the short term, Trump\u2019s tariffs will put everyday Americans in a far worse situation financially. \n\n1. Higher Prices for Consumers: think everyday products like electronics, cars, and groceries.\n\n2. Increased Costs for Businesses which will lead to job cuts, wage stagnation, and passing costs to consumers. \n\n3. Retaliation from Other Countries making U.S. exports more expensive hurting industries like agriculture and manufacturing.\n\n4. Disruptions in Supply Chains. Remember COVID? \n\n5. Market Uncertainty & Economic Slowdown. Investors and businesses hesitate to expand during tariff wars, leading to slower economic growth and more job losses.\n\nWhile tariffs aim to protect domestic industries, they often come at a short-term cost for both consumers and businesses.\n\nBottom line, we are all in for a wild ride on the Trump train",
