We need a supermajority ruled through an iron fist before either side could enact any major reforms. Whether you want to destroy the federal government, or vastly expand social programs and tax the rich, you pretty much have to break rules and be ruthless.",

The whole point here is they don't have anything remotely resembling a mandate no matter how many times Trump or a GOP Congress critters claims otherwise. Trump won by the same type of small margin in the popular vote that has become standard, Republicans have a hostorically small majority in the House, and nowhere near two thirds of the Senate. Leaving aside the idea that Congress is dysfunctional, they don't control enough of it or have enough discipline to actually do any of what Musk is doing through legal/constitutional methods.",

Republican government using its power to enact its agenda and the folks on the left only have \"Hey, don't think you have a mandate. Now kindly please leave everything just as the Biden administration left it.\"  Yeah that'll probably slow 'em down!",

                                    "body": "\"They don't have a mandate\" definitely isn't a political argument that has  any utility for elected Dems to make on the floor of Congress, but if you're a regular person talking politics it's a relevant frame of analysis specifically in the way I framed it.\n\nWithout the kind of broad popular support that a mandate indicates, you're left with the reality that getting your changes through means doing them through the conventional constitutional process, and if you don't have the votes in Congress to do what you want without the other side working with you (see again, no mandate) then you need to make compromises. It definitely doesn't mean leaving g everything as it was, and it in no way authorizes you to act extra constitutionally in the manner Trump and Musk are.\n\nI also need to point out that while most of the GOP at this point has consolidated around Trump as evidenced  by the insanity of some of his cabinet picks and the GOP Senators almost uniformly bending the knee and approving them, the opposition among the Democrats is still a mix of centrist liberals and further left democratic socialist types. There are a whole.lot of Democrats who cannot really be characterized as \"the left\", and who would gladly work with centrist Republicans if there was any such thing left in sufficient numbers. Maybe they're closeted center right who just live in gear of Trump's followers and Musk's money, but for now they aren't acting like one would expect.",

It\u2019s just a new form of control by telling you you\u2019re a hateful person to say mailman instead of mail person. The point of language is to convey your thoughts to another person. If the point gets across then why does it matter. All it does is put race and sex at the forefront of the mind so you see racism/sexism everywhere, there\u2019s studies that prove that. The media is now telling people that everything happening is dangerous, but it\u2019s only dangerous to globalists agendas, which again are just more ways to control people.

Populists promise more than they can deliver, unless you see what Trump is doing now by ripping apart the government, and he still won't deliver much on his economic promises. Neither would anyone on the Left. But when you give people things, they expect more, or they don't want to give up what they already have. \n\nAnd who is going to pay for it?

That's not even counting costs associated with the damage to programs. 2 years to recoup the costs associated with the benefits and wages of the employees who were already planning to retire or quit that are effectively getting a bonus for joining with this policy. \n\nThe government has an annual attrition rate floating around 6% annually half of which are retiring. Until this policy breaks that they are operating at a net loss. I'd be surprised if they didn't break 2% just from those retiring and planning on leaving federal service.\n\nAlso to maintain any possible savings they can't hire anyone off the street. This may be the plan as they want to reshuffle federal workers but that would still require us wanting to be reshuffled to other positions. This leaves me with the belief that cost savings through federal workforce reductions are impossible to be claimed. They'll take every resignation as a win though and distort that it's less than what's needed.",

At least with Musk, there is not Supreme Court precedent that he is immune, even though he's probably never going to be held accountable (Trump would pardon him anyway). \n\nLastly, Musk claims he is choosing which contractors are going to get paid. Do you think SpaceX is still going to get their money? Something tells me they will.\n\nWhy do you care if a post is criticizing Musk instead of Trump?",

However, I believe this to be an argument for DOGE to acquire the services of qualified lawyers to prevent such incidents. \n\nAs DOGE actions in general, they're a presidential task force. They can recommend executive action to the president and act as his agents within his limits as head of the executive branch. So long as they have his approval, they can enact any policy a president can lawfully order.

Each branch has specific duties and areas of authority, and no branch can overpower the others. \nWhy separation of powers is important \nIt prevents any one branch of government from becoming too powerful.\nIt creates a system of checks and balances.\nIt ensures that the government is not arbitrary or oppressive.\nThe three branches of government \nLegislative: Makes the law\nExecutive: Enforces the law\nJudicial: Interprets the law\nExamples of separation of powers in action\nThe Senate: Confirms presidential nominations, which gives it influence over the executive and judicial branches. \nThe president: Can veto bills, recommend legislation, and nominate judicial candidates.\"\n\nThe legislative branch (Congress) creates the laws, which includes budgets and spending. Once approved by Congress, the president does not have the power to unilaterally change approved spending. It is one of the reasons for Trump's first impeachment during his first term. He withheld congressionally approved aid to Ukraine in an attempt to blackmail them into digging up dirt against Biden. The Executive (president) is supposed to uphold and enforce the laws approved by Congress. We can see with all of Trump's sweeping executive actions that he is attempting to consolidate power with himself, which is directly against the separation of powers in the constitution, and should be illegal. For instance, there are reports that he will sign an EO soon to shut down the department of education. He doesn't have that power though. It was created by Congress, and only congressional action can disband it. None of this really matters though when Republicans control every branch of the government now, and are all too weak and cowardly to stand up to him.",

The  Biden Admin said they needed to complete environmental impact studies first, (which wasn't what Congress had authorized).

If something important is cut, it will then be re-evaluated and added back in if necessary.\n\nAs to the constitutionality, it seems to be like many things Trump does, not breaking the law per-se, but instead bypassing decades of tradition and procedure. The biggest question is if they are overstepping Congressional power of the purse, or if they are within their executive authority to block and handle funds. I know the Executive branch has done this before (on a much smaller scale), but am unsure of if a line has been crossed in this instance, and most likely the courts will have to decide.",

Businesses and give agencies hire consultants all the time to give them recommendations on ways to make improvements.  That's what Musk is doing as far as I can tell. Musk isn't firing anyone, putting anyone on leave. He's recommending to senior leaders that they do so, and so far senior leaders seem to be accepting the recommendations. Sure there is lots of room to argue about the wisdom of the recommendations, but that's a different question.\n\nAs for access, to the payments system for example, that was approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. Again, maybe not wise but certainly not illegal for the Secretary to give access to a consultant if he wants to. And at USAID, my understanding is that Musk and his team have security badges, proper building access, etc. Not security clearances,  to my knowledge, but building access granted by senior USAID officials or other government officials. Nothing wrong with that. I'm sure consultants/contractors get such access all the time. I assume they aren't getting access to Classified information without clearances in place,  and I've seen nothing to indicate that's an issue, yet anyway. \n\nPutting aside personalities, and politics, I can certainly see that what Musk/DOGE is doing is aggressive and very unusual. But hiring consultants and giving them access and taking their recommendations is certainly not illegal.",

This is the underlying premise behind the separation of powers envisioned by the founders. If the Executive branch can circumvent funding decisions made by Congress we have a monarchy/dictatorship. \n\nThe premise is that the Exec Branch oversees the military and agency administration,, the legislative branch the creation of laws and the allocation of funds, and SCOTUS serves a the check to make sure that neither of these groups overextends their authority \n\nAny decision by Trump, or our designated dictator Musk, to circumvent this is unconstitutional.\n\nFiring IGs is definitely illegal.

This criminal statute prohibits federal employees from participating in matters that affect their financial interests. The law is crystal clear: A federal employee cannot participate in any \u201cparticular matter\u201d that affects their financial interest or the interests of their companies. Every time Musk makes decisions about government efficiency or procurement while controlling Tesla, SpaceX, or his other companies, he\u2019s potentially violating this criminal statute.\nThe Ethics in Government Act builds on this, requiring extensive financial disclosure and establishing specific restrictions on how federal officials can interact with matters affecting their private interests. The Act was passed after Watergate precisely to prevent the kind of private-public power merger we\u2019re witnessing.\nThen there\u2019s the STOCK Act of 2012, which explicitly prohibits federal officials from using nonpublic information gained through their position for private profit. Given Musk\u2019s role in DOGE gives him unprecedented access to government information while he runs multiple public companies, this law becomes particularly relevant.\nThe Hatch Act also comes into play regarding his control of X/Twitter while serving as a government official. When he uses the platform to censor speech about government employees or promote particular political interests, he\u2019s potentially violating restrictions on federal employees using their position to influence political discourse.\u201d\n\nMore examples^",

Doesn't that piss you off?\n\nLet's look at it from a left-wing perspective, what else could be done with that money? In the same year (2023), there were 36.8 million Americans living below the poverty line. Just that 236 billion could have been given to those people every year, and the money entering their bank account would increase by 6.4k each per year.\n\nAgain, doesn't it piss you off that it was wasted as \"improper payments\", mostly overpayments? **This is the real issue.** There are reasonable estimates of the **total** waste/inefficiencies being closer to 1 trillion, every single year. Some even put it closer to 2 trillion. That would be around 25-50k per impoverished American. Wasted, instead of helping anybody good, not impoverished people, and not the people whose work generated the taxes.\n\nThe people tasked with fixing this naturally needed access to the Treasury payment system. An executive order established DOGE, and while it was initially thought that it would exist outside government, the executive order actually formed it inside government. The people working for DOGE are part of the government, authorised by the highest levels of government. The president is the leader of the executive branch, under which all federal agencies sit.\n\nAt the current rate of spending, the US government will end up very screwed financially. This is super important.\n\nAlso, why is everyone so sure it was private computers being hooked up, rather than public ones, given they were hooked up by government workers carrying out the orders of the leaders of the executive branch? Surely they were issued government computers a couple weeks ago.\n\n>For supporters of this administration, what is the defense for this end run around the constitutional process?\n\nCould you be more clear in how you believe the actions are unconstitutional? Doge is full of government workers, carrying out the orders of the duly elected leader of the executive branch.\n\nThere are also quite a few recent supreme court cases that suggest that a lot of the regulations issued by federal agencies are probably unconstitutional.\n\nThere will be court cases that shake all of this out.",

Rich people can buy our leaders, ensuring that none of the little people have a say in anything. And things that rich people want get pushed through with impressive speed, while things that help the little people get stalled until everyone forgets about it.\n\nEnter Musk. As the guy with the biggest checkbook, he buys our government. Since the government only listens to the rich, they will have no qualms with obeying Musk without question. But this time, Musk is the clear top dog - before, a group of rich people squabbled for power, but now, Musk is the clear leader of the rich.\n\nInstead of a group of rich people with conflicting interests, fixing our country now rests in the hands of a single man. And this man has the money and influence to do whatever he wants to our government - there will be no delays like what the little people have to deal with. Even the rich people less influential than Musk will have to deal with delays caused by their competitors. If Musk wants something done, it will happen. For example, if Musk decided that universal health care should happen right this moment, he can gather the support to do that, Big Pharma be damned.\n\nWe may feel otherwise, but I feel that Musk believes that he's moving the country in the right direction, now that the guardrails stopping him are out of the way.",

Shouldn't the government be held accountable for the way they spend our tax dollars?
