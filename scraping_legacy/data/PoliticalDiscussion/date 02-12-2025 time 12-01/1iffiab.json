That means, he must \u201cfaithfully\u201d execute the laws as Congress passed them (that comes straight from the Constituion). He also cannot legislate himself, he cannot dictate policy outside of the scope of what Congress passes through law.\n\nSeveral of his executive orders are just simply illegal, they are not within his authority, and they constitute an attempt to legislate.\n\nWhy is this a problem? Because that would make him a dictator; a head of state that unilaterally passes law.\n\nWe don\u2019t have a dictatorship in the US. We pass law through Congress, who represent us.\n\nAdditionally, the Constitution only gives power to Congress to allocate funds. The President cannot order that funding be ceased for actions that Congress has taken. His order to freeze Federal Spending was also Unconstitutional.\n\nThis goes for all present and past actions. Laws that Congress passed previously that he might not like, only Congress can repeal those laws. It\u2019s a process. Trump cannot unilaterally decide which laws to enforce or not enforce. That is not HIS call to make. The Constitution requires the President to \u201cfaithfully execute\u201d the law.\n\nTo reiterate, these protections are all in place to prevent tyranny, to prevent a dictator from making orders that the country needs to follow.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions just in these areas are fascist. Point blank. He is trying to dictate policy unilaterally. He is showing a disregard for the separation of powers, the constitution, and many other laws already on the books.",

You gotta remember that while there are definitely exceptions to the above, the military aren't politicians; they will reflexively defend its existence in a way a legislative body can't or won't.\n\n  \nCould be wrong tho idk",

You can remove them from their post, by reassignment, but they're actually protected at most levels from the president entirely. You would need to court martial them or otherwise find the legal mechanism.\n\nEven higher ranking officers are technically immune from straight firing, they just traditionally resign when asked instead of the inquiry process needed.\n\nWhile Congress could pass a law changing..oh who are we kidding Congress couldn't tell you what day of the week it is if they had to first pass a major bill.\n\nAs a result the first time a soldier says \"no sir, I do not quit\" Mr booze happy has to prove his competence and find a legal reason to eject someone.

You'd need to replace all the CCMDs, and the MAJCOM/ASCC/AF COs, and all the BN/BDE/REGT/DIV COs and DCOs/XOs. Then you have to hope that the CCs are on board, and the PLs, and the PSgts.\n\n>Do you think the average BN is going to question any command at that point and face court martial and jail time?\n\nAn infantry BN is ~1k people. Yes, a lot of them will stop and question orders they believe are illegal. They kind of really hammer the point home in Basic and pre-deployment.",

By putting loyalist lackeys in charge the army becomes loyally useless. Which is usually a problem when the despot is a despot. Not everyone just sits by and does nothing and your army is now fundamentally broken.  The Soviet union for example disposed of many of the top generals, because Stalin feared them, and then tried to invade Finland. They won, but purely with the ability to simply outlast their enemies.\n\nRather notably, Hitler did NOT go about trying to massively change the army initially and it turned out much better for him. Germany was always going to lose, the manpower and industry of the US, UK and Soviet each outnumbered the entire axis power (France should also have not been lost) but Germany wehrmacht was left largely as it was, with only a few removals to clear his way. This left him with a core of solid officers. Not overly loyal, as the original plan for the general staff was to literally lose the battle of France and toss Adolf under the bus, but very competent when the time came. They even turned an obvious loss (France) into a stunning victory. \n\nNotably the one time he did put political power over the military prior to 1939, he got Goering. Competent pilot, loyal Nazi bad leader, shit human being. Goering likely saved the British army. He definitely screwed up the invasion of the USSR by demanding air planes instead of tanks.\n\nAnd no, this isn't a Nazi good. They did plenty of other stupid shit, obviously.",

Specifically, whether or not an individual would refuse to obey an instruction given by an authority figure even if that instruction would result in harm to the victim. Roughly a 3rd would refuse, and 2/3 would execute the instruction. There was some variability in different replications such as the proximity of the authority figure to the subject as well as what constitute an authority figure.\n\nFor an actual case study, we can look at the micro history ordinary men by Christopher Browning which looked at a German order police battalion during the second world war. The vast majority of the men in this battalion were not Nazis or at least not ardent Nazi supporters. They were generally of middle age. They were ordered to kill several villages worth of Jews throughout the war. His findings were that about a third of the battalion would take part in the shooting of Jews quite willingly, another third would take part reluctantly, and a third would avoid taking part at all. (If anyone needs the citation for this I can provide it, but it\u2019s late and I don\u2019t want to rummage through a book looking for page numbers right now!)\n\nThus, given your question, we can presume that about 2/3 would likely comply with authority, and a third would resist. In practical terms, dismantling democracy imposing authoritarian rule is unlikely to result in immediate death \u2014 we can argue about human rights, etc. but the deaths that these violations may eventually lead to are nowhere near a certain as squeezing a trigger, or administering a lethal electric shock. The stakes of compliance were much higher for the order policeman, and the milligram subjects.

Since veterans isn't solely composed of white men looking at active service for instance  30% racial minorities roughly 20% female (varies by branch)  it is reasonable to suppose that white men who overwhelmingly fill officer roles as the intersection of those above are liable to be redder than either category above.\n\nIt is also reasonable to suppose that the entirety of the upper echelon will shortly be replaced by loyalists. What will happen is that bad behavior and harm to the people will lead to violence by at least a tiny number of individuals. This will be used to justify greater harm to the public which will inspire at least slightly more violence which justifies more force to suppress it.\n\nIf you look at calls by Trump to deport Americans and previous requests to shoot peaceful protesters this leads to concentration camps and murder and those in the military who wont go along with it face decades in prison and the real risk that that it won't be overturned in their lifetime.\n\nThe net is that if you see someone in a US military uniform you should think the same as if they were wearing an SS uniform with a swastika.

Joe continues to govern, or rather his handlers do through him, and begins the process of criminalising MAGA rhetoric and symbolism. Etc etc.\n\nIn this case the Military would do precisely nothing. They would watch it all and carry out Joe's orders.\n\nIt's a fantasy that the military in the US holds the executive to account. Only the judiciary can.",

Enlisted men take a different oath than the officers and the officers understand on a deep level what that means\n\n2. Every General needs to be confirmed by the Senate. Remember the jackass football coach from Alabama holding up confirmations of promotions of all those generals? It was like 200 couldn't get through for over a year? Yeah well the Democrats can do the same thing. So even if Trump appoints generals they can't be put in positions of leadership until they are confirmed\n\n3. Joint Chiefs etc when they leave go back to being 2 star generals and are not just promoted to 5 stars. The Joint Chiefs and Generals can only be fired by a president during what is called a state of war. Since we finally pulled out of Afganistan we are no longer in a state of war and the most a President can do is ask for their resignation. They can ask for a hearing which they have 6 months to determine if they should be removed. That being said most generals would resign but any general that is qualified to take over is going to be just like the current ones. \n\nThis shit wouldn't fly with the military",

You can't say \"25th amendment 25th amendment 25th amendment\" and Trump just magically vanishs like Beetlejuice.\n\nThe 25th only temporarily removes the president until the president declares he's fit again. That's it. That's why it's most common (only!) use has been when a president themselves uses it to pass it to the vice president while they have medical procedures done. \n\nSo if for example the current cabinet declared Trump unfit under the 25th, Trump merely needs to say \"I am fit\" or something to that form and he's back and ready to go. Probably purges his cabinet though. Vance wouldn't even get to sit in the cool chair.\n\nIf you want to remove the president you need the House to impeach (50%, nearly doable) then the Senate to Remove at 2/3rd. That one is a tough challenge. Republican couldn't even pull it off with a supermajority and a clearly violated law (unconstitutional but violated), not much chance of it currently.",

Trying to frame this as a partisan issue just proves you care more about scoring political points than discussing the facts. \n\n>  \nThe military \"leant\" the FBI equipment, but I saw pics of Army personnel in tanks\n\nFirst off, yes, the military provided equipment through standard programs that also give gear to police departments. That doesn't make it a military operation. Military personnel were present for advisory roles, not command. Unless you can show actual military leadership running the raid instead of the FBI all you're doing is listing vehicles and acting like that proves something it doesn't. \n\n>If the gas killed people it was poisonous\n\nThat's not how definitions work. CS gas is classified as a riot control agent and not a poison. Just because something has deadly consequences in confined spaces (especially with fires involved) doesn't mean it was 'poisonous'. You might as well call water poisonous because people drown in it. \n\n>They should have just waited for Koresh to go into town and arrested him.\n\nSounds nice in theory, but in reality, law enforcement had been investigating Koresh for months. He knew they were watching and it's not like they didn't consider arresting him outside the compound. Acting like this was some easy, obvious solution ignores the complexities of the entire situation. \n\nYou're more interested in 'winning' an argument than actually discussing the facts. Every time one point is debunked you move the goalposts instead of engaging with what's being said. If you actually cared about what happened, you'd stick to one argument instead of shifting around to try and 'win'.",
