    "selftext": "From 1936 to 2000, West Virginia voted democrat reliably. Even until 2016, they voted for a Democratic governor almost every year. They voted for democratic senators  and had at least 1 democratic senator in until 2024. The first time they voted in a republican representative since 1981 was in 2001, and before then, only in 1957. So why are they seen as a very \u201cTrumpy\u201d state? ",

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 paved the way for the massive media consolidation that gave us Fox and Sinclair. The financial deregulation in 1999 also led in a straight line to 2008. Not sure how the Unions actually felt about that, but in hindsight these things also look like a betrayal of the working class.",

Biden was more pro-Union than any Democratic President since FDR (the rest of them all had their issues with organized labor, including Harry Truman and the coal miners), but his sun set on the job.\n\nCulturally, the Democrats became a white collar party, lately of the Zoom or Microsoft Teams class, and those who have to work at a job site, with their hands, have no obvious champions in the current party.\n\nGive me the name of a big time Democrat who actually put time getting callouses on their hands, and who talks like this affected who they are.

It was traditionally a big supplier to the US Steel industry, but because of changes to how we make steel in the US, most of that coal is now **exported** to places like China, India, Brazil, and Europe. With 'Trump's Tariffpalooza' and retaliatory measures from other countries, WV\u2019s market share is likely to shrink further. After all, the Chinese are back in business with the Aussies and we can expect the Canadians and Europeans to ink deals now that the US is looking irrational.  \n\nAll that aside, the met coal industry is a melting ice cube. The biggest driver is *innovation* in the steelmaking. \n\nHere's what happened. In the US, steelmaking began shifting from blast furnaces to mini-mills (electric arc furnaces) in the 1970s, a transition that accelerated in the 1990s. These mills enabled us to produce steel more cheaply (from scrap) and do not require any met coal to operate. This is not to say demand is zero for met coal, blast furnaces still exist to make technical, high purity steel -- e.g., aerospace, pipelines, electrical components -- but the demand is well off the peak. Worse, for the met coal industry, the demand is shrinking because everyone is moving towards those electric arc furnaces.  In addition, there are pilot projects exploring hydrogen direct reduction, which, if successful, could replace blast furnaces. \n\nNow, on the thermal coal front (largely from places like WY and MT along the powder river basin) natural gas has been a killer. \n\nAs you rightly point out, there's been a shift away from coal towards natural gas for power generation. Natural gas plants are a lot cheaper to build, maintain, and, given the massive amount of gas that's fracked in the US,  cheaper to supply. In addition, they are 'dispatchable' or you can quickly spin or or shut down a natural gas generator. Coal plants are slow to start up and shut down, making them less flexible in modern energy markets. FWIW, Nuke plants have the same issues. \n\nThe reason why dispatchability has become a valued characteristic for generators is because of the market-based reforms that happened in the late 1990s under FERC Order 888. Wholesale power is now *mostly* a free market, so power can move across the grids (except in TX) to satisfy fluctuations in supply and demand. Moreover, as there's been a shift to renewables, natural gas plants have stepped in to address the changing demand and supply patterns.",

There was a political realignment that was the collapse of the New Deal coalition. The civil rights movement, the rise of Reaganism, and the popularity of \"limited government\" principles, started to really shake things up after 1980. By the time Obama was elected, the left/right divide became starker than ever, and with that 2010 midterm, most rural Democrats still left in Congress lost their seats. \n\ntl;dr version: The collapse of the New Deal coalition saw all the progressives moving into the Democratic party, and the backlash to civil rights moving into the Republican party. For anyone who's shocked that there were progressives in the Republican party, look up [Rockefeller Republicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Republican). They literally supported universal healthcare!",

In many states you can see this happening, where Democrats and Republicans are becoming pretty uniform across the country. This didn\u2019t use to be the case, as like you said Southern and Midwestern Democrats were very different from one another. But with the nationalization of US politics, the variance of policy opinions of candidates of the same party is getting smaller and smaller. \n\nUnfortunately for Democrats, this makes their job a lot harder for them. They have to provide a national message that also resonates with local issues. What ends up happening is they end up with a laundry list of talking points where at any given district people would only care about a few of them. \n\nThere are some exceptions though. In states where one party has entirely dominated you\u2019ll see people run as DINOs or RINOs because registering as the other party would be a non-starter.",

Circumstances have slowly conspired to force the left to re-embrace the state as a tool but unlike early liberals not really as a legitimate cultural entity.

You might be able to chalk 92/96 up to the fact that there was a strong and somewhat viable third party option that took votes away from Republicans, for example. \n\nIf you want to dig into the issue a little deeper, I'd recommend pulling up some exit polls and looking at them side by side. It will give you a much better, data-based answer than the usual response which is something like \"WV is full of dumb people.\"",

            "body": "Copy pasted from another post. I think they explained it well. \n\n\nA warning from an America who understand America and Americans.\n\nI live in rural America, a place where roughly 80% of the population in the 2024 election voted for Trump.  I know dozens and dozens of Trump voters.  My father-in-law is an evangelical Christian.  I\u2019ve been to church our here on several occasions.  Being a white man, other white men out here just assume I think like them and say things openly and comfortably.  I have an exceptionally good read on them and their mindset.  \n\nSKIP BELOW IF YOU WANT TO GET TO THE MAIN POINT  \nTo prove this, I am going to tell a quick story, you can skip below if you don\u2019t care to read it.  Christmas of 2020 I was at my parents house out of state, and politics came up.  My family is a working-class family, and they watch various news sources but mostly Fox News.  We talked about a lot of stuff and my Mom and Dad didn\u2019t believe what I was saying about Trump voters. In the moment, I said to my parents: \u201cMom, Dad, I\u2019m telling you right now, that between now and January 20th they will try to overthrow the federal government.  Roughly 1.5 weeks later I got a phone call from my Mom \u201cI can\u2019t believe it, you were right\u201d.  Her and I watched the Jan. 6 insurrection on TV and talked about it over the phone.   \n\nMy prediction, which I was 100% confident in, is based on what I saw as the convergence of a handful of things.  1. Economic misfortune.  2. Religious ressentiment towards an increasingly secular culture. 3. What I describe as the industrial economy hitting the information age like a sports car hitting a brick wall.  4. Increasing reliance on alternative news sources promoting far-right ideology.  5. the conversion of churches into pseudo-political organizations. 6. breakdown of traditional gender norms. 7. Failure of the education system to teach philosophy, ethics, and civics. 8. online self-segregation of political discourse, i.e. bubbles.  In my view of things from living out here, talking to people, seeing the yard signs, seeing poverty like I\u2019ve never seen before, and routine engagement in conservative online spaces, my view was that while America had seen many of the above before, this time in history is unique because they were all coming together at the same time.  Each of those things listed above are self-reinforcing, and frankly they\u2019re too complex for government to figure out all at once.    \n  \nMAIN POINT  \nYou\u2019re in trouble, and you need to prepare yourself.  Most of the people around me are not capable of abstract or analytical thought processing.  I can\u2019t fully explain it, but I\u2019m telling you they\u2019re not.  At the same time, they believe several things that are important: 1. they\u2019ve been screwed over, personally, by liberals. 2. they\u2019ve been screwed over collectively by other nations. 3. They\u2019ve been conditioned over a lifetime not to question authority, with church being the main driver of that. 4. They believe their government has literally been stolen from them.  5. Same goes for culture. 6. They believe that liberals are literally evil. 7. They believe they are on the side of God.  8. (IMPORTANT) They believe that Donald Trump was sent by God to right the world. \n\nI\u2019m telling you right now, if Donald Trump says invade, they will do it.  If the U.S. Military refuses due to congress not declaring war, which in the U.S. Constitution requires, then many of these people will form unregulated militias and it might take more time, but they will eventually organize to invade.  I\u2019m not trying to cause panic for your country. Growing up I lived just across the border from Canada, my family visited often, and one year I even ended up dating a Canadian girl and spending the entire summer up there.  So, I say from a place of great admiration and respect for your country and your people, the situation is very serious.  I don\u2019t know exactly what types of programs and systems your military has, but I would highly advise all people of age learn how to use a firearm.  Likewise, I would highly suggest that you all quickly learn about combat tactics and basic military strategy.   \n  \nI am locked into American politics.  And over the past 8 years I have watched time after time after time after time, 1000 times people say \u201cTrump would never do that\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s just how he is\u201d.  And time and time again I\u2019ve watched him do all the things people said he wouldn\u2019t do.  It gets worse, and worse, and worse and no matter how bad the last thing was and how much you think he will stop at this or that  line in the sand, he goes past it. Worse, time and time again we\u2019ve said to ourselves \u201ccongress would never allow that\u201d, \u201cRepublicans won\u2019t let it get to that point\u201d, the corporate lobby will reign him in, the courts will bring an end to this, and so on, and guess what? It hasn\u2019t happened.  And it\u2019s not going to happen.  \n\nI say this with complete sincerity, Donald Trump is untouchable.  And I\u2019m also saying, that at this very moment there is not a single lever/force of power or opposition in the United States of America that is capable of reigning him in. At this very moment, the only thing between him being the President of a constitutional republic and him being a dictator with complete control is him declaring himself as such, and if he did there is nobody left here to stop him.  It\u2019s the unspoken reality of the situation.  Right now, despite appearances, if Donald Trump were to say \u201cThe constitution is suspended\u201d, we will immediately be in a \u201cLaw of the Streets\u201d situation.    \n  \nYOU\u2019RE NOT CRAZY.  The situation for Canada is as serious as it seems.   \n  \nI\u2019m extremely sorry that we have failed in our efforts to resist his rise here.",

Trump \"delivers\" here.  \n\nFirst, we have to talk about how depressed WV is.  It was coal country and developed its entire economy based on white working class coal workers but the modern age has devalued their labor significantly.  Regulations, competition from natural gas and renewable energy, and fracking have really depleted the amount of workers needed.  They are a rural state but with the mountains they just don't have the geography to get into any agribusiness.  Further, they don't have any major cities to develop a white collar economy.  Tourism brings in some money but that industry cannot prop up a whole economy.  Trump comes in and is against free trade and for white working class rights.  You can debate whether he is effective (I don't think he is) but those former WV coal miners love him and believe he will put them back to work mostly by gutting their international and renewable competition.  I think they're wrong and Trump's not going to stop automation and natural gas which is their main competition.  \n\nSecond, they are culturally conservative.  They are white rural undereducated Christians.  They love all that Fox News culture war stuff.  They also have an aging population as younger people tend to leave the state for employment.  \n\nThese factors mean it is Trump country by a wide margin.  \n\nIt *used* to be democrat because the democratic party used to be the one that was authleft.

Meanwhile, Republicans effectively capitalized on cultural issues (guns, religion, traditional values) and promised to revive the coal industry - Trump's \"bring back coal\" message particularly resonated here. It's less that WV suddenly became super conservative (it was always socially conservative), and more that the Democratic Party's priorities shifted away from the economic populism that once attracted rural, working-class voters in coal country.

This process was accelerated when LBJ supported the Civil Rights Act and War on Poverty.\n\nBy the mid 90s, much of the white South had moved to the GOP.  West Virginia was among the last of the Dixiecrat holdouts.  It didn't quite have the internal racial tensions of other Southern states, as it is almost entirely white.  Still, it has a lot of the same attitudes, so it was a matter of time before it followed other Southern states.\n\nThe \"solid South\" used to be very Democratic.  It has completely flipped.  Same attitudes, different party.\n\nThere are still some Dixiecrats in Kentucky.  They will vote for Democrats in local races, but for Republicans in the federal ones.",

I\u2019ll expand since the comment is too short, but the quick version is coal is the biggest economic driver in WV, even though Whole Foods employs more people than the coal industry.

They were the only state that flipped blue to red in 2008 and they\u2019ve been solid red ever since.
