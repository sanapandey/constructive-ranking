    "selftext": "*The Ordinance of Nullification*\u00a0was a law passed by South Carolina in 1832 that declared the\u00a0*Tariff Acts of 1828*\u00a0and\u00a0*1832*\u00a0unconstitutional. In order to prevent a full-on constitutional crisis, the federal government ultimately resolved South Carolina's grievances by lowering tariff amounts, via the\u00a0*Compromise Tariff of 1833*. Could the *Ordinance of Nullification* provide a historical roadmap for U.S. states today to band together and collectively sue the federal government over the current Canada/China/Mexico tariffs by highlighting enormous harm to their state economies? With a Supreme Court that is ever more traditionalist and states-rights oriented, might victory be possible?",

The Ordinance of Nullification has no legal value. Recall that the first act in response to it was to authorize force against South Carolina.",

If the state Supreme Court overturns it and the state executive chooses to enforce it, then the federal government would need to invoke the Republican governments clause. \n\nIf (and I say if because who knows how the conservative justices will rule) the federal Supreme Court deems it unconstitutional but Tennessee attempts to enforce it, then yes, ideally our federal legislature authorizes a response, potentially including force if necessary. Hopefully that would be avoided, of course.\n\n\nEdit: I should touch on why this is a different scenario. In the nullification crisis, a state attempted to reject a law passed by the federal government. A state does not have that power, so the federal government is responsible for enacting and enforcing the law. In the case of the nullification crisis, that potentially would have required the use of force. \n\nIn the case of Tennessee, the state legislature may have passed an unconstitutional law, but the federal government has no actual nullification power over state laws. So the federal government can only step in under certain circumstances laid out in the Constitution.",

Maybe if the coastal blue states came to an agreement to take over the ports and customs (de-nationalize them I guess) at ports located in their jurisdictions and nullified any tariffs for products coming in, the president might listen. \n\nTrump is on a path to destroy the United States.
