    "selftext": "\nI recently came across a video explaining something called the 'Russian tail' in election data analysis, and it got me thinking\u2014how often does this pattern appear in elections worldwide? If it's been documented in contested elections before, could it be a sign of deeper systemic issues? And more importantly, could similar anomalies have influenced past U.S. elections\u2014or even shape future ones?\n\nA Russian tail is a statistical anomaly often observed in elections with suspected fraud. Normally, vote distributions follow a smooth bell curve, but in some cases, an extra spike appears\u2014suggesting that votes may have been shifted in specific precincts. This pattern has been documented in Russian elections, Georgia elections and and some watchdog groups claim to have seen similar anomalies in Romania most recently. There were independent journalists and analysts that reported they noticed the same anomalies in the November 2024 U.S election.\n\nWith all the concerns about election integrity and foreign interference\u2014especially disinformation campaigns aimed at making people distrust results\u2014do you think statistical anomalies like this could impact public confidence in the U.S. electoral process? Even if fraud isn\u2019t proven, does simply showing these data patterns create enough doubt to destabilize democracy?\n\nCurious to hear what others think! Have you seen any credible research on this in U.S. elections? Could this be a real issue, or is it just another layer of political chaos?\n\n",

                            "body": "I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m convinced by it, but I am intrigued and would support further inquiry. \n\nBasically, for anyone wondering, the case lies in two primary points:\n\n* **\u201dDrop-Off\u201d Votes:** Essentially, \u201cdrop off\u201d votes are people who only vote for president (the so called \u201ctop of the ticket\u201d) and don\u2019t vote down ballot (so numbers \u201cdrop off\u201d after that). They note that Harris-Rosen drop off votes for early votes is especially low, less than 100 in fact, whereas the differential in every other category on the order of magnitude of thousands (or more). This in particular is used as a launching point for the next analysis. \n* **Clustered Proportions of Vote Shares:** This one was more tricky to understand initially, but the basic case is that the probability of a given machine collecting a certain proportion of votes cast for each candidate should roughly follow a normal distribution centered around the final proportion of vote share. However, for the early votes, this was not the case and the number of machines seemed to be bifurcated. \n  * It\u2019s kind of hard to explain this in text only, but let me try to explain: in theory, the machine you would use should be random. In a perfect 50/50 race, you would expect on average each machine would get exactly the same number of votes from Rs and Ds. However, in real life, there would be some variation because not every machine would have exactly a 50/50 split. Some would be 40/60, others 55/45, and so on. Considering nothing else, we would expect more results around 50/50 than 90/10 or 10/90. Those and anything in between are possible, but they become less likely as you get further from the result (ie, 50/50). Alternatively, for this 50/50 scenario, you could assign a bunch of people to flip a coin a bunch of times and record the number of times it was heads and the number of times it was tails. Not everyone would get exactly equal numbers, but if you add up all of the heads and tails, you\u2019d probably get roughly 50/50 and if you looked at the distribution of the number of people who got heads (or tails a certain number of times), it would probably look like a normal distribution. While theoretically possible, you would find it highly suspicious if everyone only reported getting heads for every flip or getting tails for every flip, because while this could average to 50/50, it is a highly improbably scenario. One last note: as voting and geographic data aren\u2019t so simple, there can be confounding and explanatory factors, but the purpose here is just to demonstrate the basic probability theory. \n  * What makes this point more compelling is that they show that the same strange distribution is not reproduced in Election Day voting. One would expect if a shift had occurred, it would at least be able to be faintly seen in Election Day data, but that\u2019s not the case. The Election Day machine proportion values look more like what you would expect. This is also even more unlikely given that large samples will tend toward normality and more people voted early than on Election Day. \n\nIt is of course entirely possible that this is simply how the chips fell and nothing nefarious took place. Stochastic phenomena can sometimes just produce weird results. However, it seems very unlikely. It is also possible that there is an explanation that is simply unknown to the analysts, such as some kind of geographic or demographic effect. However, this also leaves open the possibility that something else happened to early vote totals. \n\nAgain, I wouldn\u2019t say this is a smoking gun, but it is definitely something that merits some level of additional consideration.",

It might be a reason to pursue a recount...but it's a bit like the drones recently, we're probably looking for something bad and finding it somewhere so we can scream about it...\n\nI didn't work in that area, but the machines have air gaps, when you vote, it literally prints how you voted right fucking there for you to review on a paper ballot. Any manipulation would show up different from a hand count. When a machine is closed out, one copy of it's data summary gets stuck on the front door so that you could personally go total up a precinct yourself, if you desired. Another copy goes to the election bureau, another copy goes to a safe storage place to be held for a duration in case it needs reviewed.\n\nI believe it's pretty damn secure. Everything you do requires opposing parties to do it together, you sign your name to it, if there are any inconsistencies then someone's going to be looking at you after following the paper trail.\n\nThe election manipulation that I see is out in the open. Republicans denying ballots, changing rules, gerrymandering, fraud and fucking lying 24/7 on TV/print/YouTube/social and dummies repeating that at work and In non political society so that it penetrates to people that aren't paying attention at all. \n\nWith all that going on, I wasn't able to change one mind of one person that loves me, in hours long debates where we literally watch what I'm saying happen.\n\nThis was exactly how it looked.

I explain in a reply to the highest visible comment in this thread, the samples they're using (votes on a given tabulator) don't meet the criteria for the central limit theorem to apply - they're not the same size and can't really be normalized, and we have no idea how the underlying random variable (what machine someone votes on) is distributed. \n\nFor my own sanity, and because the alternative was working on my taxes, I read the entire thing to the end, resisting the temptation of sweet merciful death. What they are seeing in the early voting data is regression to the mean, and the skew in the distribution you would expect to see if one candidate is winning.\n\nFirstly, regression to the mean. If I have variably sized samples, as the samples get bigger they more accurately represent the underlying data. This explains the \"unusual pattern\" shown in the plots of vote percentage against number of votes. With a very small number of votes in the tabulator, you can get all kinds of different vote percentages with fairly high probabilities. Consider the extreme case where you just have one vote on each machine and 100 machines - you'd expect roughly 60 machines that were 100% Trump and 40 machines that were 100% Harris. You can model what that plot would look like if the underlying voting pattern were perfectly random with a 60/40 distribution, and while I haven't done that, because I don't hate doing my taxes that much, its roughly the shape they show. \n\nSecondly, skew.  They plot the number of machines with percentages of Trump (or Harris) votes on a histogram. You would not expect this to be normally distributed if one candidate has more votes. You expect there to be skew, that is to say one tail will be longer than the other, because you can't get more than 100% or less than 0% of the vote. To see this, consider if all the votes were for one candidate - there is obviously no way to get a normal distribution. Now consider if all but one vote ... There is obviously a continuum as the results get closer to 50:50 they become less skewed.\n\nThis is precisely what I meant when I said I didn't think the authors had adequately considered the null hypothesis. They didn't model what they expected to happen if there was no problem, and in fact had they done so they'd have gotten something very like the results they actuallly saw.",

The GOP is blatantly following the fascist playbook like it was a step by step instruction manual at this point)\n\n1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism\n\nFascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\n\n2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights\n\nBecause of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \u201cneed.\u201d The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, and long incarcerations of prisoners.\n\n3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause\n\nThe people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists\u2026\n\n4. Supremacy of the Military\n\nEven when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\n\n5. Rampant Sexism\n\nThe governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation.\n\n6. Controlled Mass Media\n\nSometimes the media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation or by sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Government censorship and secrecy, especially in war time, are very common.\n\n7. Obsession with National Security\n\nFear of hostile foreign powers is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\n\n8. Religion and Government are Intertwined\n\nGovernments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government\u2019s policies or actions.\n\n9. Protection of Corporate Power\n\nThe industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\n\n10. Suppression of Labor Power \n\nBecause the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.\n\n11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts\n\nFascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.\n\n12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment\n\nUnder fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n\n13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption\n\nFascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n\n14. Fraudulent Elections\n\nSometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections..",
