    "selftext": "And can he dismantle individual programs within a department without Congress? \n\nFor example, could Trump issue an EO that would move student loan programs from the Dept of Education to another department? \n\nIf not, and such a move requires Congress, can he shutter such a program with an EO after it gets moved around to another department? The hypothetical scenario I\u2019m imagining is that the current bill introduced by Republicans (HR 899) to shutter the Dept of Education gets passed because they assure everyone that the key programs are being moved to other agencies, not eliminated (and this is indeed in the bill). But then the executive branch is somehow able to gut or eliminate those individual programs once they get moved. Is this possible or likely? \n\nAlso thinking about this in terms of USAID and other programs.",

I think of it this way, very simplistic.... if I give you an allowance of 100 bucks a month, then you can pretty much spend that on whatever you want,  or not spend it at all. If I give you 10 bucks for lunch, then you can only spend it on lunch, but you can eat whatever you want for 10 bucks. If I give you 10 bucks for a turkey sandwich with mayo, lettuce and tomato and a diet sprite, then that's what you have to buy with that money. Very simplistically, that's how Congress appropriates funds to be disbursed by executive agencies. In the first instance the executive branch has a huge amount of discretion on spending the 100 bucks. In the last instance, very little discretion.",

However, the President can simply refuse to spend money that Congress has allocated because the executive is in charge of enforcement of the laws passed by Congress (*see* discretionary refusal to enforce federal criminalization of marijuana in some states). So while the President would not be able to officially abolish an agency created by Congress, he would be able to starve it to death and tell everyone not to show up to work. \n\nThe check on the President's power to refuse to spend allocated funds or enforce valid laws passed by Congress is impeachment/conviction. But the President can only be impeached for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\" ... the exercise of the Presidents constitutional authority to refuse to spend allocated funds would rarely rise to the level of impeachment, unless it was associated with another crime (*e.g.* when Congress impeached Trump for threatening to withhold aid to Ukraine, they impeached him for \"Abuse of Power\" for allegedly conditioning the aid on reopening the investigation into Hunter Biden the son of his political opponent, and \"Obstruction of Congress\" for refusing to comply with a subpoena).\n\nWith USAID, President JFK created the agency via executive order in 1961. Since the President created the agency, he could (back then) unilaterally abolish it. However, in 1998, Congress passed a law recognizing the agency as an \"independent establishment\" not within the direct organization of the State Department (but it's still in the executive branch, and reports to/take directives form the Sec. State).\n\nAfter 1998, it would require an act of Congress to abolish USAID. However, as discussed previously, the President can fire people, tell people not to show up to work, and reorganize the internal structure and affairs of the agency (with notice to Congress... but doesn't need permission). The only thing the President cannot do to the USAID without Congressional action is \"abolish, merge, consolidate\" the agency as a whole. But other than that, he's free to refuse to spend the money allocated, fire people, tell everyone to stop working, etc. The President is the \"boss/CEO\" of everyone in every agency in the federal government.",
