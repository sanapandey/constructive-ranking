Fear can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, if we act on it. What alternative outcome do we *actually* want, instead of the one they're planning for us? Eyes on the ball, people.\n\nIt seems likely they may be trying to engineer some sort of crisis or collapse that they can take advantage of to enact something even worse as a \"solution\". Be prepared to co-opt that moment to make other demands or proposals that aren't just a credible alternative, but a *more compelling* alternative than what they will have to offer.

The USA has 4 levels of government, each with their own 3 branches (executive, legislative, judicial) and their own law enforcement; city AKA municipal goverment (city police, city courts, city council, mayor); county (county sheriff, county courts, county council, county mayor/executive; State (state patrol, state courts, state capitol, governor), and Federal.\n\nUS judges are also supposed to be non-political. That's why many are appointed for life, to free them from political pressure. Unfortunately, the two political parties subverted that, and judges have become intensely political.\n\nThis was all designed to be an elaborate system of \"checks and balances\", preventing any one group from obtaining excessive power.\n\nProblem is, our Founding Fathers did not anticipate how much wealth and power corporations would eventually obtain; by law corporations were kept deliberately small and weak in the pre-Civil War era.\n\nThey also did not anticipate the rise of massive political parties that would then act in bad faith, destroying all the carefully designed checks and balances built into the US system.\n\nTrump should be in prison for life for insurrection and numerous financial crimes. Except...Trump-appointed judges protected him. So did the Republicans in Congress (who are accomplices in the Jan 6 insurrection). So did law enforcement, which in the US has quite a racist, fascist culture, a legacy of US slavery. So did Republican voters. So did both the right wing and the mainstream media. And in turn, the Republican legislators and Trump  protected the 6 corrupt Supreme Court MAGA judges. All at our expense.\n\nNo government system can survive a bad faith assault like that. It's not just the legal structure; it's also the culture.\n\nI fear more and more the US will have to go through the same thing Germany did, in WW2 and the holocaust, in order to truly transform into the decent, free, truly democratic place to live, that the Founding Fathers intended.",

My state voted for Bernie Sanders both times he ran for President (he's my pick, too). Our governor has vowed to fight Trump tooth and nail. Republicans have little power here.\n\nThat's the odd thing about all this for me. So far, my personal life hasn't been affected at all, by any of this. I'm retired. I live up in the mountains. City troubles don't reach where I live; it's peaceful and quiet and beautiful where I am, and local folks are big on being neighborly and helping each other out. I have a good life. \n\nThen I read the news and it's all terrifying stuff. The US just became fascist, and we don't know how bad it's going to get. Nazi holocaust level bad??\n\nYet life in my valley still feels completely normal; peaceful, prosperous, safe. Kind of messes with my head a bit. \n\nMain change I see offline in my personal life...Once in a while, on shopping trips into the city I'll see a MAGA person in full display, a large \"coal burner\" pickup truck, with a huge US flag in the back, spewing thick clouds of black smoke (very illegal here, their trucks get impounded for that) and they're crowing about Trump's victory. And there's a feeling of fear in the air I've never felt before. The calm before the storm?\n\nOne reassuring thing, Trump is now the most despised President in US history by Americans, and millions of Americans are looking for ways to resist him. Less than 2 weeks into his Presidency and he has the lowest approval rating of any US President in all recorded history. The MAGA folks love him. No one else does.",

They happen effectively yearly at a local and state level, and every other year at the federal level.\n\n\nThose are the elections that put the people in power who hold the executive in check.\n\n\nSo the real answer is that you have to do the boring, tedious, difficult work of supporting candidates at the smaller levels and convincing people who don't agree with you that they *should* agree with you and vote for the same candidates you want. Fundamentally, Trump won and the Republicans control the House and Senate because a majority of Americans wanted them and voted for them. Step 1 for anything is actually convincing a majority of Americans in a majority of districts that this was a bad idea. If you can't do that, all else is moot.\n\nNow, voting is assuming we still have free and fair elections in one or two years. Trump has already shown a complete disregard for those, and he now has the entire federal government in his pocket. If his blunders don't burn all his political capital in spectacular fashion, then we may not have free and fair elections. If that's the case, then there's really only one recourse left, and it\u2019s the obvious one, and it's not pretty.\n\n\nHowever, if there *is* some kind of violent mass uprising, either a full blown insurrection or just enough sporadic violence that we get handed back democracy, you still need support. You need enough groundswell and competent leadership to win and put a functioning government up in the fascists' place. So honestly, you need to to be doing the the tedious, boring, coalition-building in the meantime anyway, or a cute little revolution will accomplish nothing but tragedy, or worse, an even more oppressive regime.",

Militaries can and will ignore it, especially if there is popular support behind the idea. Militaries are usually pretty loath to support unpopular ideas in functioning democratic societies because that's not what they do best. \n\nNotable example The German army was oathbound to the Wiemar Republic, to protect it and uphold its constitution until 1934.\n\nThey only did so when it benefited them. They went after some like the sparticus and beer hall putsch but when the Paramilitary leader Kapp did his putsch, they sat it out. When Kapp was defeated, they punished any officer who opposed him.\n\nAnd that's assuming they even are allowed to do anything. Note that in the USA, the military is explicitly forbidden from being used in domestic operations for the most part. If Trump decides to do something, the army has limited capacity to oppose him because nobody wants the army trying to **dictate** policy. The Germans had that issue, it led them into two world wars that ended poorly for everyone.",

Seriously, we keep giving the president more power, and Congress wants to do this. Why? Because then Congress doesn't have to do anything. \n\nWhen things go bad for their party, that part of Congress then gets to look like the mighty hero as they push the resistance forward to stop the evil Bush or Clinton or Obama or Biden. Very Hollywood moment where they scream wolverine and make a big show.\n\nBut Hollywood resistance only worked because as it turned out, Bush and his dad were not Hitler reincarnated. Romney wasn't the next coming of Nazism. And Obama and Clinton weren't Stalin. So the show worked.\n\nTrump didn't do the show (and irony for the man who televises everything). He didn't care, he wants attention and the resistance standing in the open just got gunned the fuck down like the idiots they were.\n\nBut hey, they will get reelected. If Trump is Hitler reincarnated, they'll be sent to camps and die. Because that's what Hitler actually did. If Trump is just an incompetent narcissist, they'll probably manage little until he leaves office in 2029 or dies. On the plus side, the current batch of democratic party congressmen seem unlikely of calling him a fascist, but I'm sure a few will. Because fascists routinely let their critics stay in power...",

So this year you vote for the 20% progressive so that next time you can vote for the 30% progressive.\n\n\nWhen primaries come around you show up, vote your preferences, shape the party platform. When the general comes you pull the lever to move the window.",

And a significant part of Congressional workload is fundraising, if you don\u2019t bring in enough donors and money for the Party (either Party because they both do this), you get primaried\u2026.\n\nETA:  The opposition (Democrats) can\u2019t even keep their own caucus in line to thwart fascism!  Tim Kaine, former VP nominee with Hillary, voted to confirm Kristi Noem as Secretary of Homeland Security.  If such high ranking Dems are defecting from the Party line, how can the public put any hope into a solid Democratic resistance?  We simply cannot rely on the Dems to get us out of this when they are actively supporting Trump\u2019s agenda.\n\nThe Executive is run by a 78 y/o toddler who believes if he signs a piece of paper, whatever it contains will be law.  The Executive branch no longer recognizes checks and balances, and is in the process of wresting the purse strings from Congress\u2026.  Trump is simply waiting for an excuse to declare martial law and really roll out the fascism.\n\nThe Judiciary\u2026.  Our last hope.  Ha!  It has been bought and sold too\u2026.  Thomas is nothing more than a vote for the highest bidder.  Alito is a Christian Nationalist who has been recorded saying one side must \u201cwin\u201d and is a fervent supporter of MAGA.  Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett all owe their positions to Trump, the Heritage Foundation, and Leonard Leo.  Chief Justice Roberts supports Trump\u2019s agenda 2/3\u2019s of the time\u2026. That is a Supreme Court which is obviously stacked, at a minimum of 5/4, if not 6/3.  If Thomas and Alito retire, that just solidifies the Court\u2019s bias for decades to come.\n\nThat\u2019s all three branches of our government friend.  They are all corrupted.\n\nTo rely on a means within this corrupted system to save American Democracy, is insanity.\n\nIf you have ever wondered what you would have done in 1930\u2019s Germany as Hitler rose to power\u2026. You are doing it right now.\n\nIf that means being comfortable, going to work, keeping your head down, coming home, checking out, and not engaging\u2026.\n\nHistory will not judge you kindly.",

Which, is simply and seriously, very fascist.  But to say that anyone in our government is fascist, under estimates everything.  We're not, though it does very much seem like we are.

Fascists criminalize certain behaviors, but criminalizing certain behaviors is not, by itself, fascist. If it were, virtually *all* societies in human history would be fascist.\n\nEdit: Leftists are hilarious. Only leftists would downvote a comment advising someone to educate themselves.

What you need is for the implemented policies to be so terrible and cause so much carnage that the country basically implodes from internal and external pressures. Then, if enough people are willing to take the lesson, you can rebuild something strong and decent.\n\nThere are some historical models where it didn't take quite that much to turn the country away from authoritarianism (like Taiwan, I think). But it still got pretty bleak before it got better. \n\nThe best way to stop a fascist government from implementing terrible policies is to not elect one in the first place. But it's a bit late for that now, so we're all in the find out stage. \n\nThe only possible hope I can think of is to pressure local politicians, especially Republicans in swing districts, to start resisting and/or looking at impeachment. Trump doesn't have to consider re-election, but they do. As the situation gets worse and people get angrier, they might be willing to start working against Trump to save their jobs. Maybe.
