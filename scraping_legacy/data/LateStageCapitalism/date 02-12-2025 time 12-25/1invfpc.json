That means any support for any liberal capitalist political party (like the Democrats) is strictly prohibited.\n\n LSC is run by communists. This subreddit is not the place to debate socialism. We allow good-faith questions and education but are not a 101 sub; please take 101-style questions elsewhere.\n\n We have a zero-tolerance policy for bigotry. Failure to respect the rules of the subreddit may result in a ban.\n\n\n***\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
