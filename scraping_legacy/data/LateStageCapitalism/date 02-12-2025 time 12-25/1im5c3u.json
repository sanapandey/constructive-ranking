    "selftext": "I\u2019m done. Fed up with the whole sour system. Our leaders do not listen to us, they listen to their lobbyists, their oligarchs, their inner circle of .1%er buddies. We tried voting. When that didn\u2019t work we tried calling our legislators. When that didn\u2019t work we tried protesting. Since that is not working I\u2019m going to do the one non-violent thing I can that will get their attention: defund them. I\u2019m withholding none of my income for federal taxes this year and I will file a big fat fucking zero. They get nothing from me personally. Will they come after me? Probably. Do I care? Not anymore.\n\nWhen will I resume paying taxes: \n\n-when I get a functional healthcare system.\n\n-when microplastics in my drinking water are no longer a concern.\n\n-when living costs become affordable\n\n-when safety is prioritized over profits\n\n-when a bunch of other shit that should be a basic human right is implemented",

That was the bain behind the black panther movement. Since 180 million Americans today are functionally illiterate by global literacy standards, that will be the bain towards any modern socialistic movement. That illiteracy gives the American government the ability to sway the masses easier due to a lack of education. And demonizing any socialist movement with cultural references, advertisements, and dog whistles.",

It makes the illiteracy problem magnified.  AND, the modern American has a life of comfort (historically speaking) that makes revolution virtually impossible. We have sources of easy entertainment to placate us, very few of us ACTUALLY fear for our lives daily, and we see global images of poverty and war that by comparison we\u2019re not doing bad overall. \n\nSo, while even the most educated among us might be outraged at what we\u2019re seeing in politics, not enough of us are willing to sacrifice what it would take to really revolt. \n\nIn 1776, the average life expectancy was ~38. Now it\u2019s double that. Back then, people were more willing to sacrifice themselves for a cause because they were going to die in a few years anyways and there weren\u2019t enough comforts to keep them happy. In an ironic twist, life is too good now for the common person to be willing to sacrifice their lives for a cause. So until life is SO unbelievably bad that people have no choice, I\u2019m afraid any kind of grassroots opposition movement will never have the kind of momentum needed to create real change.",

But I\u2019m doubtful that the government would actually collapse and even more doubtful that any other countries would step up to oppose us considering the military might of the US. It would take generations before other countries could surpass the US in international influence and military power in any way that would be meaningful. Besides, N. Korea is a great example of how long an authoritarian government can survive in the face of global embargoes. There are enough bad actor states to keep them supplied just enough to survive, and the USA has a LOOOOT more natural resources. \n\nEither way, life is gonna suck here a lot in the coming years. I\u2019m trying to decide if I\u2019d rather whether it here the best I can or try to escape to another country. Escape would be a better life for me, but I\u2019d feel super guilty leaving friends and family behind and feel powerless to help them. \n\nMy biggest worry is the US becoming an AI-assisted surveillance state of our dystopian nightmares. Between Musk ransacking every government agency that could oppose Trump and the amount of surveillance we already are under, it\u2019s not a far leap to imagine Trump declaring anyone who opposes him a terrorist/threat to national security and beginning some real holocaust-level detainments. We already have an incarceration system that is basically slavery with extra steps. The corporate elites would jizz in their pants for more free labor under an expanded prison system. \n\nThere are so many similarities between the USA today and other empires in collapse/authoritarian regimes on the rise, but we\u2019ve never seen those kinds of events happen with the kind of technology we have today.

A general strike would be much more effective since it actually cuts off the Capital at the source. However, a general strike without a revolutionary movement will do little to nothing in the long term.\n\nWe need a working class revolution. For a revolution to work, you must first build a revolutionary movement; following these general steps:\n\n1. Raise class consciousness and awareness (through discussion and education)\n\n2. Organize locally with other socialists/communists, helping to build foundations for mutual aid/dual power structures\n\n3. Unionize your workplace\n\n4. General strike\n\nAs for #1, my recommended intro reading list:\n\nThe principles of communism - Engels (https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm)\n\nSocialism utopian and scientific - Engels (https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/)\n\nThe state and revolution - Lenin (https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/)\n\nThere's also a ton of good YouTube content if that's more your thing ( but you really should read the foundations of theory as well), highly recommend these channels as a good starting point:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@SecondThought/videos\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@YaBoiHakim/videos",

I feel like most popular protests are still \"playing on their system's rules\", and the elections by themselves are flawed (either side is a corrupt far-right weirdo), but that happened before and we solved It. Just not in an enjoyable or \"moraly neutral\" way (by that I mean, 1920's protests, 1950's comunists granting us civil rights and equality rights, even the french revolution could enter that list). We are going to be called villains and paranoids either way, at some point you gotta start considering setting something on fire, organizing protests meant to stop a whole sector, If they only listem to the money tem hit them on the money. Protesting at comfortable times and being afraid to disrupt their economy is the exact stereotype of the pacifist being cut down with the tree he was protecting. (Please, I'm not saying anyone should commit any crime whatsoever, I'm saying maybe you could find some hope on people who organize in a more disruptive and long-term way, and right now they're being arrested or being shut down as \"commie wokes\")\n\nPS. Yes the Black panthers and Martin Luther King Junior were comunists, and 2pac too, who made up the \"THUG LIFE\" movement that by itself reduced (at the time it nearly ended) violence on schools on dangerous neighborhoods that didnt have government support. Sorry to be the herald of news from 60 years ago, those people are widely accepted as heroes and their comunist motivation is often left out of the story)\n\nI heavily recomend on not exposing yourself alone and with your personal information like that. The government works with billions If not trillions of dollars. Thank you for being motivated and trying something but it would be far more effective AND SAFE to enjoy your life, support a union, and do something like paralise amazon's delivery system on a holliday with your coworkers, or start funding a non-profit insulin distribution system (I havent heard about those yet, and the patent for insulin ended a few years ago already, its public domain. Many countries have free insulin on their healthcare systems, and it costs like one cent to produce one of those mini-containers meant to last a week, there is no reason for insulin to be expensive)\n\n(My auto-correct is trolling me, I edited what I could find after reading again)",
