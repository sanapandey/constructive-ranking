Boycotts don't work because the companies that are worth billions sell things like food and oil that you need to survive. We all need to build alliances at work, notice I didn't say you had to build a union. You first and foremost need a group of people who are willing to tell your current employer no. That's how you start. Anything extra they want you to do is negotiated, any changes to the status quo needs to be negotiated. It starts with taking back your power. ",

For a general strike to be successful, it has to be attached to immediate material gains, not just political ones which can seem abstract and removed from the working class.",

Waiting until 2028, or even February 28 might be too late.\n\nHow do people find mutual aid groups to help support the strikers so people can start striking now?\n\nI want to do mutual aid, I can't go to protests due to severe ptsd from my time in the army.",

Right vs left will continue to shout at each other about trans people taking a piss in a public bathroom, or whatever other divisive talking point they conjure up. That leaves you with 50% of the population who will be united enough to come together and strike. However more than 50% of those people work hourly wages and can\u2019t afford to strike. That leaves 25% of the population except you have to take into account that many people just won\u2019t be up for it or care enough. So realistically you might get 5~10% willing to join arms and fight.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I truly wish this would happen but unfortunately the freedom cage you find yourself in has a very, very short chain once you try and move out your lane.
