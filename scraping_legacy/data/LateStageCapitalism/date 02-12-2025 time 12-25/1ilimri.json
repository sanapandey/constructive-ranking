The fascists are going to get violent. \n\nI think it\u2019s time for Americans to start arming themselves for self defense.\n\nAm I overreacting?\n\nEdit\n\nTo clarify we\u2019ve never had a government for the people. It\u2019s always been a government that represents oligarchys/corporations/rich people. \n\nThe only difference now is they seem to give zero fucks anymore and continue to break social contracts at an alarming rate day after day. I could easily see them rounding up anyone whose ideologies differ from theirs and killing them. In fact, capitalists have said they think violence is necessary to *cleanse* the evil left/socialists/communists of their ideology.\n\nEdit Edit\n\nGuys the military is not an automatic win factor in this scenario. If that were true every military during every revolution would have won, yet they didn\u2019t. \n\nThe military relies on civilians. We supply them with logistics, maintenance, communications, and medical. The military would hardly last a month without civilians. \n\nIf you think they\u2019re just going to roll a few tanks into town and call it good then idk what to tell you. They can\u2019t just start bombing civilians either. That would **really** piss off people in the military who may have been on the edge about what they were doing, but continued to follow orders anyways. \n\nIt would mainly be boots on the ground and they would be just as vulnerable as civilians.

He had even been seeding ditches around where we lived with bull rushes that would be harvested, fermented, and distilled for ethanol to power the generators he had stockpiled. \n\nHe had a trust exercise where he would ask people in the group to hold onto part of his gold bullion stock for some made up reason, and gauge how they handled it. \n\nI held onto about 10k of his bullion for a couple years, and afterwards, when I questioned him about it, he said it was cheap insurance in the long run to know he could trust people.\n\nHonestly, he was the most well prepared person I've ever met, and I was always a bit disappointed for him every time one of his predicted doomsdays never came to pass.",

And this is the real world, not an action movie.  That being said, when Trump ordered the stop payment on government grants and contracts, I went out and bought several more boxes of ammunition.  Not so much for immediate defense, but more for hunting.  \n\nPeople don't realize how much they rely on the government until it goes away, and then it gets real dark real fast.  If that order had stood for a week, there'd have been lines out the door of every grocery store, a run on banks and mass chaos.  I wasn't confident I'd be able to get ammo much longer. I've worked managing federal funding for most of my career, so I felt like I had a head start / understanding of the situation more than the average Joe.",

You have problems when society is built on looking out for yourself. But in a society where people take care of each other, they will continue to take care of each other, even without a government.",

I think if you want to do firearm training / learn gun safety and buy one, by all means, go for it. But you should be thinking about it in the mind frame that not everyone has access to the resources necessary to do so for themselves and not everyone feels safe with a gun. But even if they can\u2019t own a gun, gun safety and knowing how to properly work guns are valuable skills. And I think there are lots of other things that need to be taken into consideration. The panic / urgency is such a turn off for me because I feel like it only happens when someone like trump is in office, and then how many people actually do anything?",

Of course, you should also be familiarizing yourself with as many non-violent methodologies as possible too, because those are safer and often more effective. If you are going to take the responsibility of owning a firearm, do so safely- proper training and equipment, secure storage, etc. No sense endangering yourself or your family.\n\n- There is a danger of giving Trump too much credit here. He's working very hard to create *the appearance* of radical change.
