I am taking what Musk says in this video and then considering his recent tweets about unlected judges being able to block presidential orders. It makes sense to me what he is getting at, he doesnt want the agenda being pushed to be pushed back on or blocked. Those unlected judges he speaks of are put in place by the elected officials we put in place over the years. Both sides have benefited from judges blocking presidential orders such as Biden having his student loan forgiveness blocked and there are countless others that had been blocked. Should Biden of just ignored what the judges did and moved forward? We cant have it both ways. The judiciary is the checks and balances.

Which means that people can't depend on sales of their used cars to help offset the costs of replacing them. \n\nRight now it seems the best bet for EVs in the near future is for government regulators to simply make it more and more difficult to buy anything else while at the same time making it increasingly difficult for Chinese to export cheaper EVs to western countries. \n\nRight now it seems that people are more then happy to just stick with hybrids and not deal with the hassle of EVs. \n\nJust pointing it out because Tesla's stock price decline doesn't have everything to do with Musk being a maniac. \n\nIf I was a board member I would be kinda hoping that his antics would help the conservative-side of America see switching over to EVs as something more desirable. \n\nPersonally I would never voluntarily pay for a Tesla or any other EV. Or most new cars for that matter.  I am not a fan of dumping 10s of thousands of dollars into rolling spyware.\n\nThe technology that goes into actually motivating electric cars is just a blown up version of what the Japanese developed for Walkmans in the 90s.  The rare earth magnets, motor controls, motor design, lithium chemistry. It is all early 90s tech. Aside from the batteries these things should be the simplest and most reliable form of transportation ever made. But instead manufacturers have decided to make them ridiculously over complicated to the point of near useless for the sake of selling them for tens of thousands of dollars over the cost of a normal car.  Fake innovation to fool the rubes.  All for the sake of trying to control price expectations for the day when the government finally decides to give people no more choice in the matter.",

So you could say storage of data is part of my career.\n\nThat being, there is a data center (ie computers/server) that stores data at Iron Mountain) so I don't believe its all manila folders and a single elevator.\n\nWhat's more alarming is the use of physical paperwork that is also stored there.  Say what you want about data stored via servers (getting hacked, bugs, lost data) there are numerous problems with storing data via file cabinets.  I'm a military vet and I've been told that my DD214 has been lost at least once in my life.  Things that could happen in mere milliseconds in a digital system could take months or years in a paper system with human error or abuse a bigger possibility.\n\nHere's my news article in 2023 mentioning this long wait time: https://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2023/12/opm-retirement-backlog-hits-six-year-low-third-time-year/392576/#:\\~:text=For%20years%2C%20the%20federal%20retirement,its%20heavily%20paper%2Dbased%20nature.\n\nWhatever system they are using it is running too slow for the people who need it.  A pattern that we're all too used to when it comes with government related programs.\n\nThis is very different from the Seed Vault, the seed vault is storing physical things.  You can't digitalize foreign objects though I guess you could store the DNA information of the seeds digitally.\n\nRemember, Vanguard, 401ks, and Banks don't use this system and they handle a lot more retirement accounts with less complaints.",
