                                    "body": "If the Republican party expands, one of these two things will happen. Either they will double down on Trump's big government ideas, or they will create big factions in the party. One side being populist / protectionist, while the other is Libertarian and non-interventionist. There is already a strong mandate for a less interventionist foreign policy. Trump ran as a peacemaker and won, the problem is that he is threatening with war right now which would break that promise. There is a mandate for peace but he may end up continuing the same neo-con policies.\n\nRemember, Republicans have voted for more Libertarian sounding candidates before. Reagan used a lot of Libertarian rhetoric, \" The government is not the solution, the government is the problem \" but the problem was that he increased spending instead of cutting spending. He spoke like a Libertarian but acted like a Authoritarian, the mandate was there for more of those  ideas but he just didn't follow through on them unfortunately. We are seeing them talk about the spending problem, but we'll have to see if they actually go through with it (it's a pretty common tactic for both sides to complain about the debt only to expand it). If DOGE can cut a trillion in wasteful government spending, that's a absolute huge win.\n\nTL;DR: There is a pretty strong mandate for Libertarian ideas in America. People have voted for smaller government, gun rights, non-interventionist foreign policy. If you can bring in a charismatic candidate who is ready to actually deliver on those ideas, there will be a big movement for the Libertarians in America.",

Then we go off kicking a lot of ass and then the military industrial complex starts getting money and the hose of violence can be pointed almost anywhere.\n\nGiven our position if we want to be non interventional we do need to advocate for peace and be serious about it while at the same time make anyone who attacks us pay dearly.

Meritocracy was no longer viewed as a good thing, free speech was no longer good if your speech went against whatever that particular community held as important (whatever happened to \"I may not agree with what you say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it.\"), and certain freedoms were seen as harmful instead of freedom being the goal.\n\nI'm as far from \"conservative\" as you can get, yet my views also aren't popular in the leftist zeitgeist now, even though they used to be.

Wow what a shocker. \n\nThose messages were dated much earlier before his capture by law enforcement. There were absolutely dirty feds that had dollar signs in their eyes, that's not shocking. Is there better evidence you can show that the feds were the ones who sent those messages rather than Ulbricht's defense that there were many different Dread Pirate Roberts? \n\nWe don't need to paint Ulbricht as a saint who made no ugly mistakes in order to agree that this pardon is an overall good and the Silk Road was an overall good for harm reduction.\n\nEdit: the former vendor saying he didn't do it is definitely his own speculation, and it seems clear that the feds had control of the former vendors devices after he got involved with the feds to set-up the fake murder. The evidence they had against Ulbricht as well as the enormity of the drug conspiracy charges was enough to drop what could've probably been argued as entrapment\n\nAlso I don't even think this mentions the second murder attempt against the Canadian former vendor which was set up to scam Ulbricht",

It was for this reason that abortion was made illegal, ie to protect the lives of women, because childbirth was the less dangerous option even in that dark era.  It had zero to do with the health of a fetus, because the beginning of life was universally defined as \"when a baby is born and brought forth.\"  This prohibition came to travel across the Atlantic via Common Law.
