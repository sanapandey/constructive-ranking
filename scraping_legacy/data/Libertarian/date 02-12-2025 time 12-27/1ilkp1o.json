He was clearly a threat before even his first term, all the Democrats were squawking about it throughout his entire presidency, and yet despite having a trifecta they did nothing at all to legally restrict Biden's power while they had the chance. It would have been very simple to, for instance, restrict the president's ability to unilaterally declare tariffs, but they never even tried.\n\nNeither party really believes that presidents should have less power. The Democrats believe the president shouldn't use his power to be an asshole to his political opponents while the Republicans believe he should, but they both basically believe the president should be a king.",

The fundamental diagnosis of libertarianism\u2014that today\u2019s democratic governments are much larger and much more intrusive than they should be\u2014is obviously correct. The remedy proposed, however, does not have anything like a track record of success.\n\n>In fact, I believe the libertarian opposition to sovereignty, dating back to Locke, is a major cause of modern big government. Our present establishments, not to mention our tax rates, dwarf any divine-right monarchy in history. The attempt to limit the state, if it has any result, tends to result in an additional layer of complexity which weakens it and makes it more inefficient. This inefficiency gives it both the need and the excuse to expand.\n\n>So we may ask: why does the post office suck? Not because it is sovereign, but because it is not financially responsible. Its freedom to be wasteful and inefficient is what gives it that familiar Aeroflot feel. (The bankrupt airlines, such as United, feel more like Aeroflot every year.) When we postulate a sovereign authority which is financially responsible, like a Patchwork realm, we have no reason to expect it to display these pathologies of government. In particular, we cannot expect it to waste resources in order to pointlessly annoy its residents, a form of inefficiency in which democratic regimes seem to positively revel.\n\n>The sight of a financially responsible sovereign, even the thought-experiment of one, is a good lesson for libertarians, because it reminds us what a healthy government actually is. Today\u2019s democratic megastates are to healthy sovereigns as liver cancer is to liver. If you find liver cells invading every other organ and crushing them all into goo, it is only natural to think that the cure might be a drug that was lethal to liver cells. But you actually need a liver. You need to kill the cancer, not the liver.",

The rest is trivially unconvincing because he's trying to do something impossible, and impossibly stupid. You might as well say Stalin is the best libertarian ever.\n\nModern states are \"larger\" than pre-modern monarchies because advancing technology advanced state capacity. The King of France didn't used to have the ability to send tax forms to everyone (but he could, at his whim, throw you in jail for no reason, which is IMO much worse than the tax forms). \n\nModern Saudi Arabia is not small government.

But there is already plenty of material doing that if you cared to look on occasion. In which case you would have your best case examples supporting his claim prepared.   So let's hear them. \n\nLastly the fact he isn't just auditing as claimed is some of the most compelling evidence he is a bigger fraud than what he's disseminating (which is almost nothing btw).  Because that is fraudulent representation..  if you dispute that I will gladly provide a source for the claim he is doing more than auditing, and that the secretary of the white claimed he has only read access.",

Most of those new hires would have been replacements for retiring workers, and they were not just enforcement agents but also customer service reps, IT folks, etc.\n\nThere has been no push for the IRS to increase their auditing of the middle class.

They only needed the votes and they got them. This is class warfare which is not a marxist term as the republicans would try to convince you, this is the end stage of crony capitalism. Corporate is in bed with the state. Billionaires are paying politicians to funnel YOUR money into THEIR pockets and cutting congress in on the profits through lobbying.

I\u2019m glad more people are waking up to the reality we\u2019re in that the government has enriched corporate America too much and for too long that we are now battling market behemoths that control everything we buy and consume and bribe public servants to serve them instead of us. Reaganomics ruined fucking everything.

None of this is right. It\u2019s all an illusion. In reality all of this is cutting off our arms and expecting them to heal before we bleed out. It just won\u2019t happen. We need to first make a world where our arms aren\u2019t important and only then can we have a surgeon in chief amputate them.

It's the guys with an army of lawyers and CPA's constantly trying to hide their money. \n\nWhy has no CEO or billionaire ever taken Warren Buffet's million dollar challenge to prove that they paid a higher tax rate than their secretary??

Maybe the problem is a little more complicated than \"the Democrats hate you.\"",

The Trump administration has not taken any action to indicate that they intend to change that, so why blame Democrats? Interesting you say \"any amount over $600 deposit into your bank account\" when that's factually incorrect. Also, I assumed the intent was to target crypto platforms and trading more than anything else.",
