I think the statement is actually saying that there is no person in the government who can answer that question directly. If you wanted to know the answer, someone would have to go through 100+ years of laws and executive orders passed by Congress and signed by the president and identify every agency created by those laws.\n\nThere is likely no single location that stores that information in a way where you could provide an answer in a reasonable amount of time.",

Congress was never gonna fucking pass legislation to get this shit done. \n\nSure the purists here can point to the awful shit this administration is doing. I don\u2019t disagree. Trump ain\u2019t a libertarian. He\u2019s doing some really terrible horrible no good very bad stuff. But this DOGE stuff is fan fucking tastic.",

The Woke movement is full of that kind; people who hate the Dems almost as much as they do the GOP and kinda just wish death and destruction on basically everyone.\n\nAt the center of it all is Messiah-complex. Most people are looking for something to agree on in these discussions, but these people look for something to DISagree on so that they can continue to feel like a martyr.\n\nReligion is supposed to teach you to look inwards and be honest with yourself about your own limitations so that you can then accept imperfection in the presence of forward progress. Purism in politics does the opposite, where you deny and disparage all honest efforts at progress b/c you're perfect and it's the rest of the world's fault that they're not exactly like you.\n\nI'm not a Christian (grew up orthodox Hindu; now a heterodox Hindu), but the Christians call this \"blaspheming the Holy Ghost\"; it's the one sin that Jesus can't forgive, b/c the sinner doesn't _want_ forgiveness as they think they're already perfect.",

People who work fully remote.\n\nYou seem to be under the impression that 94% of the workforce falls under category 3. In reality, a very large portion falls under some combination of categories 1 and 2. In fact, many of the people in category 1 conduct all of their work onsite, but are part-time workers, so they don't count as a \"worker who comes into work on a full time basis.\" This stat is quite misleading.\n\nWith that said, I fully support firing a huge portion of the useless federal government. I just think we should avoid arguing against strawmen because all that does is give our opponents excuses to discredit us.",
