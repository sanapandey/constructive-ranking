That\u2019s all they are empowered to do.\u00a0\n\nThey are not passing new laws every day about how you cross the street or whether or not you can wear green on Tuesdays. They exist solely to keep a minimum standard of safety.\u00a0\n\n\nSo if some corporate private militia was fucking with you the government would still be there as strong as ever to protect you. If the corporate militia became a threat to the gov they would lose, and hard.\u00a0\n\nThe Night watchman is no weakling. In the job he is to do he is powerful and efficient. The important distinction between this and big government is that this is his ONLY job.
