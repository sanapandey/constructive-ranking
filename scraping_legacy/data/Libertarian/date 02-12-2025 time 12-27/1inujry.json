            "body": "The steel an aluminum tariffs are not about trade.  It is blatant protectionism to shore up domestic steel and aluminum producers, ostensibly to prevent damage from a supply chain crunch like we recently experienced. \n\nWithout commenting on the morality of tariffs, these particular tariffs appear to make sense to me from a strategic sense.  We need secure supply lines in times of crisis and tariffs are one of the least interventionist ways to make sure our smelters and rolling mills don't shut down.  \n\nIt is similar to the incentives for domestic microchip production.  When we couldn't get chips from our trading partners it caused a lot of disruption.\n\nNot to mention there are safety problems with importing steel.  I worked on a major petrochem project that had to be re-designed because the chinese steel that was imported failed all the QC tests.",
