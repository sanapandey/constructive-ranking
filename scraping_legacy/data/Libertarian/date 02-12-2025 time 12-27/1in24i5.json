Even dealing with regimes like the CCP in China it is going to be cheaper to do business. Especially since it gives them a reason for liking you, or baring that; tolerating you.\n\nThis is something Hitler learned the hard way after going for farm land in Poland and oil in the North Caucasus. Hitler strongly believed [in the falling rate of profits](https://www.marxists.org/archive/hardcastle/1960/rateofprofit.htm) and felt that if Germany continued to rely on industrialized trade with the rest of the world for its natural resources then it is inevitable that it would diminish and possibly fall long term as the rest of the world caught up with their own industries.  So with international trade being seen as a dead-end the only choice was to pursue a policy of [autarky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarky) and that required access to natural resources. Germany lacked these resources, but Eastern Europe had everything they needed.\n\n(note that in the Caucasus region, especially in modern day Azerbaijan, oil literally bubbles from the ground in some areas. Were as oil in Northern Africa, especially Libya, was not discovered at that time.)\n\nAnd, I am sure, that nobody wants a repeat of Hitler's 'war for natural resources' policies here in the USA. \n\nIt doesn't have a good track record, to say the least.\n\nIf you need something, just pay for it. Don't try to kill people for it.",
