Part of why I left public school was because of how futile it felt trying to teach kids who can barely read in middle school. \n\nPersonally, I think the problem lies in all the testing-not only does it cost more, but kids are being pushed to start academics in kindergarten and now pre-K. I've seen some teachers say that a child is \"behind\" if they don't know their letters and how to write their name by kindergarten, and now kids are expected to stay in their seats and learn almost the entire school day at 6. \n\nI remember learning my letters in kindergarten all of 20ish years ago, we had dedicated workbooks for each letter. We learned how to write our names and write basic sentences by the end of the year. Most of our day was playtime, or learning that just felt like play, as it should be for a 6 year old. \n\nThese foundational skills are being pushed earlier and earlier to kids who aren't developmentally ready for it. I had to try to teach 6th graders, who were still learning fractions, how to balance chemical equations, which is an algebraic equation. \n\nTheres problems upon problems in education, and school districts are always looking for what new thing they can shove money at to look good and like they're trying.",

These are likely the same kids that would have the better scores to begin with, so it\u2019s entirely possible for the curriculum to have not changed whatsoever, and the test scores to show a bit drop.  \n  \nThat\u2019s all just speculation though. It\u2019s really easy to use graph like this to make a point, but a hell of a lot harder to understand what youre looking at if you want it to actually make sense.
