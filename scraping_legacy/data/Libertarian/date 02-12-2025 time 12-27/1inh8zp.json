    "selftext": "I haven't really done the math on this, but I wonder if it's a way to sundown Social Security. Using a small sample, here goes: Stop paying my parents Social Security now, & return the money I've paid into SS to me as a tax credit over their remaining lives while allowing me to opt out of paying into and receiving SS in perpetuity. Let's say between the 2 of them they receive $40k/year, & the live another 20 years. That's $800k that isn't paid out. I've paid in $125k which would be a tax credit of $6,250/yr. But the govt would lose the $8k I pay in each year which would be reduced contributions of $160k over the next 20 years which is about when I'll retire. The net benefit to SS is a savings of $515k, but the govt also avoids paying me $48k/year for 25 years, saving another $1.2M bringing the total net savings to $1.735M. \n\nNow, my parents have no retirement savings so they'd have to sell their home, & I would need to help pay for their expenses which would be difficult. Is this a totally insane concept? ",

The program will just get renamed ,nobody will get payouts, and it'll go into a fund that only Elon, Trump, and those they deem worthy have access to. Like they'll ever give up free money.",
