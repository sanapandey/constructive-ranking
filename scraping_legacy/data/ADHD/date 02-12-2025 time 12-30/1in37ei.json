    "selftext": "I usually go to bed around 3-4am and I'm so tired (literally) of being like this. \n\nMy executive function and time blindness is terrible at night. I think it's also a case of revenge bedtime procrastination on top of the ADHD. \n\nI've tried the method of getting up early no matter how late I go to bed, so that it forces you into a good schedule and makes you tired enough to want to go to bed early the next day. But NOPE. I just push through the tiredness. I've adapted to having poor sleep and being tired. \n\nI just cant seem to break the cycle. The only thing that seemed to work is getting ready for bed early and telling myself that if I get in bed and watch Netflix...I can stay in bed as long as I want, and don't have to worry about getting up to go brush my teeth because I've already done it. Which I think is one of my issues, i'm too comfortable and I dread the nightly routine and having to stop having \"fun\".\n\nBut I told my psychologist this and he said it was a terrible idea, because I need to associate my bed with sleep and sex only. He doesn't encourage spending even more time in bed with a screen... and I was like.. isn't getting into bed at 10 and watching Netflix for 2 hours and then going to sleep still way better than gaming and watching tv till 3 or 4 am... and he said I had to find a different way, he was very strong on no screens before sleep. Which I know he is right... but I feel like my option is the lesser of two evils and could be a stepping stone to going to bed earlier. \n\n  \nAnyway do you agree? If not, what worked for you? ",

I have to stab my brain with content until I can barely keep my eyes open quickly take off my one earbud and pass out. If I'm not quick enough, my brain will jump right back into speedy thoughts and keep me tossing and turning.\nGoing to bed early and turning off the lights and watching people play cozy games is what has been working for me at the moment.\n\n- oh, but screens are bad! Try reading instead! - said my psychiatrist. The poor summer child doesn't know that reading is a trap. That once I start reading a book I will not eat, sleep, pee, work, go grocery shopping, bathe, go to work or uni, call my family or anything else until the book is done.\n\nI also start working *from bed* in the morning.\n\n\"Bed should be only for sleeping\" is wonderful, but I cannot for the life of me get myself out of bed in the morning. So I open my laptop and start working from bed until my bladder forces me to get up.\n\nIs it good? No. It's not good sleep hygiene. But it works for me. And I need to sleep and I need to work. So for now, it's good enough.\n\nMy grandpa used to say \"lo mejor es enemigo de lo bueno\" - I don't know if there's an equivalent expression in english but it has a similar meaning to \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\"",

The meds quiet my brain and if I still have some in my system I fall asleep easier. If they totally wear off I have some rebound effect symptoms where my brain races *more* and sleep is harder. Don't think that's true for everyone but something to consider! I used to self medicated by having caffeine at night haha.",

He also gets \"the window\" as dubbed by others - where it's easy for him to fall asleep & if it's missed he's up all night lol. \n\nMaybe I'll start making a coffee for my oldest before bed so he can sleep easier!

If I miss it, I\u2019m fucked\u2026and it sucks because my window naturally seems to be around 9PM - an hour after my day is officially over (aka, the crotch goblins are in bed). I used to fight it because I wanted/needed that \u201cme\u201d time, but after years of somehow functioning on 3-5 hours of sleep a night, my body said NOPE & I got super sick. That was about 3 years ago.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve adjusted my \u201cme\u201d time - if I let myself fall asleep in my window (9-9:30PM), I naturally wake up around 4-5AM. This gives me 2-3 glorious hours every morning when the house is completely quiet and I can\u2026do whatever the hell I want. It\u2019s currently 5:45AM and I\u2019ve been up for about an hour, scrolling Reddit and drinking coffee. An extra bonus is that I can have myself ready for the day before I have to worry about anyone else. I know everyone is different and this probably isn\u2019t realistic for a lot of people, but it works for me. Respect the window! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude34",

I realized if I wait to start getting ready for bed until I\u2019m already tired, then I don\u2019t have the energy to start, and procrastinate going to bed even though I want to be asleep. Now, I start getting ready for bed before I\u2019m actually tired, and tell myself that afterward I can relax and do whatever I want. Since I have energy and also want as much time as possible to relax at the end of the day, I\u2019m able to rush through it and then am completely free to chill. Then, the moment I\u2019m tired, I can immediately seize upon that and be in bed in less than a minute.

But if you feel that being on your phone in bed is in fact a problem, you can still apply the general principle of getting ready for bed early, and just chill somewhere else (couch, etc). \n\nImprovement is improvement, and the fact that you were able to identify a problem and come up with a working solution is something to celebrate.

I mostly just use a photo/screenshot.  You set a schedule/frequency and length for the commitment (or just a one off), and how much you'll get fined for each failure.  You can also set how strict or lenient appeals are.\n\nThen, you either follow through with the commitment (submitting \"evidence\" at the committed interval), or you get fined.\n\nI've personally found that even a commitment as low as $5 is enough to get me out of bed in the AM.",

So strive for that. Ideally you do something calming or even boring in bed or just before going to bed to get your brain into sleep mode, like reading a book. That is a method proven to work for people affected by ADHD and others alike.\n\nBut sleeping less than 6 hours wreaks even more havoc to your health, so if there is truly no other way to get you into bed early and making you fall asleep than promising yourself some screen time there, go ahead.\u00a0\n\n*Is* it the only way?",

I clearly stated that one option is objectively healthier than the other, but that this doesn\u2019t matter if the healthier option isn\u2019t realistic.\n\nIt\u2019s objectively healthier to cook freshly than eating McDonald\u2018s every day, not because it\u2019s normal, there are simply objective facts about the nutritional value of the food. But if you\u2019re simply not going to cook and the consequence of that will be starving to death, by all means go to McDonald\u2018s.\n\nEdit: I really don\u2019t get what part of comment provokes you to downvote it, but whatever.\u00a0",
