Then I spiral again and it gets worse. \n\nCurrently I\u2019m going to be at 7am and waking up at 3:30pm which, to put it nicely, is fucked and is ruining my life almost as much as executive dysfunction. \n\nFor you personally: oversleeping generally makes people more tired.

I eventually got used to it and now it\u2019s just part of my routine. \n\nSome things to note that I was not told upon starting but figured out by experience and research are:\n\n1. Keeping your tongue positioned against the roof of your mouth can significantly help with CPAP usage by maintaining an open airway and reducing the likelihood of sleep apnea episodes, as this posture prevents your tongue from obstructing your throat during sleep;\n\n2. In order for the CPAP to work best, it is crucial to sleep with your mouth closed, as breathing through your mouth while using a nasal CPAP mask can significantly reduce the effectiveness of the therapy by allowing pressurized air to escape, leading to less airway support and potential treatment failure; a chin strap or mouth tape can help keep your mouth closed if you tend to mouth breathe during sleep.",

Could be something as mundane as the wrong pillow or mattress, or something in the room that disturbs your sleep (noise or light source, wrong temperature, not clean enough air, too dry air, etc.). \n\nNext, fatigue could be due something hormonal, or lacking certain minerals etc. Get a full blood screen and see if something comes up there. \n\nBoth the ECG and the blood screen would be first steps before you're referred to a sleep study, and can be done by your GP. And maybe that already brings a result. \n\nAlso, you should look into sleep hygiene - all the things needed for good sleep, such as room climate, preparing yourself to go to bed, etc.",

            "body": "Curious if this has always been your experience? Or did it develop at some point? I ask because during the pandemic I went on a medication that absolutely put me to sleep, but I didn't connect the dots right away because it was one of those that had to build up in my system first. Two years later, I finally figured out it was the med and got my doctor to switch me. But seriously, during that time, I probably could have slept 23 out of every 24 hours. Not a problem I had before that medication. It was around this time I also figured out I had ADHD and was prescribed Adderall. Even taking the stimulant wasn't sufficient to wake me up (although maybe that's not too uncommon for people with ADHD...)\n\nI switched meds and was feeling at about 80% - I could finally manage to wake up and stay awake, but I still needed a nap most afternoons. But at least the nap was only about 1.5 hours instead of 3-4 hours.\n\nTrying yet another new med now and having a much better reaction! Still honeymoon phase, so we'll see if it lasts.\n\nAnyway, just asking because it's not \"normal\" to need that much sleep. You might need to have some blood tests to rule out any obvious medical causes, but you might also consider whether it's linked to any meds you're taking. And definitely worth talking to your doctor about. My problem turned out to be a reaction to an SSRI and then also to an SNRI. So I guess I shouldn't be mucking with my serotonin levels! But I haven't seen anyone else say SSRIs affected them that way.\n\nETA: you might also need to do a sleep study. Apnea can interrupt your sleep. I probably need to do one but, you know, ADHD, LOL. My doctor recommended one a year ago and I still haven't done it.",

Coffee + meds is just about the only thing that reliably wakes me up.\n\nBut trouble *not* sleeping kinda sounds like a bigger issue. Some form of narcolepsy, maybe?

These disorders both contribute to my body being out-of-balance from an ecosystem perspective and I know that affects how my body operates. I also know I feel terrible without certain vitamins, and conversely, when I\u2019m eating properly (which *is hard to do with ADHD & a medication that suppresses my appetite*) and specifically hitting my protein/fiber goals, I have a ton more energy than if I grazed throughout the day (at best). It\u2019s a challenge to meet macros of course & I won\u2019t say I hit my goals often because I don\u2019t. BUT, **food is fuel** so if you\u2019re not eating enough, your body might be telling you that through sleeping more to conserve energy - this is always how I know I\u2019m not eating enough (read: **not** through weight loss because I have my other conditions & my metabolism suffers as a result/losing weight is tough - pointing this out for others to think about).
