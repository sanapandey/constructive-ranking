            "body": "**Edit:** It  didn't occur to me to explain what Section 504 is and why it's relevant to r/adhd. The article does this too:\n\n>Section [504](https://theeducatorsroom.com/whats-difference-iep-vs-504-plan/) of the Rehabilitation Act, first implemented in 1977, prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities by entities that receive federal funding. The law mandates that schools, hospitals, and other federally funded institutions provide equal access and accommodations to disabled individuals.\n\nDisability rights are being targeted as part of MAGA's anti-DEI monstrosities.\n\nFrom the article:\n\n>A high-stakes lawsuit, [Texas v. Becerra](https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/23/23-10246-CV0.pdf), is currently making its way through the courts, threatening crucial protections for people with disabilities under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Seventeen states have challenged the federal government\u2019s updated rules, putting at risk decades of legal safeguards that ensure accessibility in education, healthcare, and other public services.\n\n>In this case, a coalition of 17 states ( Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Flordia, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia) has sued the U.S. government, arguing that Section 504 is unconstitutional and should be eliminated. If successful, the lawsuit could dismantle essential protections that prevent discrimination against people with disabilities.\n\nYou people really believed that the fascists were on your side. Well, they're not. They're out to fuck *everybody* they can. Those of you who voted for them, or *didn't* vote, you have only yourselves to blame.\n\nOh, and in case we haven't already made it clear with our anti-alt right rule or this post or any of the hundreds of other comments we've made over the years:\n\nr/adhd does not support fascists. *Ever.*",
