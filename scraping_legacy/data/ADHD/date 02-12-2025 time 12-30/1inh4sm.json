It took me 3 days to get myself to write this post.\n\nI'm so exhausted emotionally that I just can't deal with people. There's my friend from middle school inviting me to attend his wedding, I don't even have the energy to let him know that I can't attend. Not getting back to people is again making me feel super guilty. I really have no idea what to do. My inbox is getting overwhelming and I just feel like running far away leaving everything behind. I'm so in a weird state rn.",

This has been like this my whole life and I got very isolated from it. \n\nI recently got diagnosed and I read similar issues described by other people and it help me so much to read people having similar issues. \n\nI always felt defect about this aspect. Lately I have been consciously reducing my communication with other people, focusing only on one friend and my girlfriend.\n\nI feel this, as small as this circle is, is my limit right now in term of relationship I can sustain. As soon as I try to get in contact with more people I start to fail communication. So I accepted it and telling myself that's my limit and that's alright and since then I feel way better about myself :)\n\nI used to carry a ton of guilt. Thanks for sharing your feelings, I feel you!!!",

It allows her to know everything is fine and she doesn't need to worry and it relieves me from this replying pressure. Hope it helps :)",

I used to be in this state a lot!  \nI can offer advise, if you would like it, keep reading.\n\nWhat you are describing, is linked to a dysregulated nervous system. Before going into too much detail about how it all works, I would like to encourage you to try out practises that help you to soothe, slow down or simply ground yourself.  \nSome ideas:\n\n\\- (guided) meditation (start small)  \n\\- going out, try to be in nature, touch grass or a tree  \n\\- Mindfulness  \n\\- Mindful movement (for example Yoga, where movements come together with the breath)  \n\\- Breath exercises/breathwork (also, start small)\n\n  \nThese practises help us A LOT to regulate and come back to ourselves.  \nHappy to help in messages if you need more help.",

When this happens to me, even just sitting on the floor, hugging a stuffed animal or blanket and doing slow, deep breaths for a couple minutes helps.\n\nAlternative, if you happen to live with people that your comfortable with, get someone to just give you a long (20+ second) hug. Or you can even hug yourself (wrap your arms around your own shoulders reallt tight). This is something I discovered (through research) can help calm down the nervous system, too. In therapy, this was also just recommended to me as well!",

It\u2019s really hard when you\u2019re usually the one everyone comes to with their problems so when you\u2019re not emotionally or mentally available, they take offense. I find it really disappointing that as much as I try to be an open book and let them in on what\u2019s going on with me, they don\u2019t seem to truly care. I have the \u201cit\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u201dconversation every time I\u2019m able to come back around or respond, and I feel like it just goes right over their heads, in one ear and out the other. I just want to scream \u201cIM MENTALLY ILL, NOT FAKE OR WEIRD OR WHATEVER ELES YOU\u2019RE PERCEIVING ME AS!!!!\u201d \ud83e\udd72& then you have the acquaintances or professionals who reach out, and you just have to let them perceive you because it would be a little odd to have reply of: \u201c Sorry for my delayed response, I\u2019m currently mentally ill\u201d. Lbvs \n\nI will say, it\u2019s gotten a little better with the right meds but now I feel like I\u2019m repairing all of my relationships and then if I have a low moment (which happens often)  it\u2019s right back at square one. Sometimes ADHD makes you feel like you\u2019re trying so hard but nobody can see it, they only go off of how it may affect them. It can be hard to explain these struggles to people but YOU know what\u2019s going on so try to be kind and patient with yourself.",
