Just trying to understand as I am unable to turn in any work and keep a job \n\nNo one?!?",

And I'm very much aware that this would be a me problem; but I'm sure that will sour really quick when I'm suddenly late because of the bus regularly, and get fired, apply for welfare, look for a job, and the cycle repeats itself. \n\nOr, executive functioning staggers because of a job and suddenly, you're on the verge of metnal breakdown, because there's too much in your life to deal with. And you need time off... as advised by a therapist.\n\nBut I'm from a country, where we probably take mental health a bit more serious, and welfare and disability payments are reasonably good, compared to other places in the world. Employers are not that likely to take risks in hiring people with ADHD (but they won't tell you, you aren't hired, because that would be discrimination); especially if can't function \"like normal\".",

And it took tasting the good quality of life to develop motivation to keep it.\n\nSleep for 9 hours (7 does not work for me even if others can\u2019t get away with it), high protein diet, managing allergies (daily Claritin), both strength training and cardio (spin or running), staying hydrated, getting good blood work (vitamin d, even blood sugar), watching my caffeine intake, full sobriety, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s hard, but I need like 85% compliance from myself to not drop all the balls. If you\u2019re already doing all those things, then yeah- find a volunteer gig and go through disability. But if you aren\u2019t, you probably have the potential to take more control over your life than you currently do. I hope that\u2019s as empowering to you as it was to me. Research actually shows a lot of us with ADHD do much better with busy schedules- it reduces chances for paralysis. That\u2019s the path I\u2019m taking these days.\nTherapy- particular acceptance and commitment therapy, and CBT to get over my self-defeating thoughts, was really helpful too.",
