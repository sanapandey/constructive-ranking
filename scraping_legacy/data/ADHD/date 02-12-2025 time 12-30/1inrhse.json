    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\ni already read a lot of posts on reddit about people like me with adhd dont want to have kids. \nbut i wanted to ask you on my own if you dont want to have kids and also why are you sure about not having any children?\n\nso for me this thought became so clear in the past year since i started medication. dont get me wrong, i love spending time with children and seeing the joy of simple things in their eyes, making their life a little bit better everyday with laughter and good care - cause i am working as a kindergarten teacher since 5 years soon. i am now 29y old and i really like my job. but i see it as a job u know? i always think like, oh hell yeah im happy that i work my 6 hours daily and then i can just do whatever the fuck i want. if i want to rest, i rest. if i want to go for a quick shopping then i do that. or for a longer walk in nature after work, i dont have time pressure. no responsibility for anyone else than myself, my hamster and cat. thats all and i like and enjoy my life. when i see people with their children no matter what situation i am just glad and happy that i dont have kids. (it could be the cutest situation between a lil boy and the parents, it doesnt matter). i smile and thats all. but i really feel it in my chest that i dont want to have kids by myself. \n\ni would like to read your answer to my question \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",

It really created a life of panic and crisis. I talk a lot about trying to move away from that, which I find extremely difficult as I feel addicted to the chaos. But I just try to find any sort of empty space in my life to create some peace. \n\nWhat I usually say when people ask why I don\u2019t want kids is that i work with children. 6 days a week. I definitely get my daily dose of child. I cannot imagine having to come home from work and still be on for my children.",

            "body": "TL,DR warning \n\nIn my life I have gone back and forth between wanting to have one child verses not having one at all. I know I can be selfish at times, and when having a kid you have to accept that most of the time you will become second to your wants and needs and putting your child first. I suffer from Chronic Migraines and at one point I was pregnant and did not know, I only found out after I had a breast reduction surgery and shortly after the surgery I had a skipped period. I decided to terminate the pregnancy due to a few different reasons:\n\n1. I was terrified that because I had a major surgery while not knowing I was pregnant (in pre-op they did like 5 pregnancy tests and ultimately they said I wasn\u2019t pregnant). \n\n2. My now husband and I just got back together after having a major breakup and me moving out of our apartment. If I carried the child full time I couldn\u2019t say without a doubt that our relationship/marriage would be as strong and healthy as it is today.\n\n3. Economically I wouldn\u2019t be able to provide for the child, my career didn\u2019t take off until after about a year or so terminating the pregnancy and if I carried the child full term 100% without a doubt I would not have the successful career I have now, and wouldn\u2019t be able to properly provide for said child.\n\n4. My migraines were just starting to be controlled at that point and a lot of the medication I was taking I would have had to stop immediately. \n\n5. I terminated my pregnancy at 6 weeks, and during those last 2 weeks I was horribly sick. My migraines were on a whole different level, with migraines I was already super sensitive to smell so being pregnant I was 100x more sensitive and constantly throwing up. \n\nWith all of that being said, NOW I\u2019m open to having one child. My husband and I are in a place where financially we can make it work. We both wanted to be able to provide for our child, and be able to give them opportunities that neither of us were able to have growing up due to family circumstances. It sounds crazy, but as a woman the biological urge to at least have one child and experience pregnancy is definitely there haha.\n\nWhen I was younger all throughout High School and many years into my early 20\u2019s I was an adamant no. Now as I\u2019m 29 I have matured more and decided to be super open to that possibility.\n\nI think it\u2019s normal for some people to change their mind on having kid(s), and that desire can float back and forth from yes to no. Just know whatever choice you make it does NOT change your worth as a person, and that\u2019s okay not having children. \u2764\ufe0f",

Absolutely no interest. Ever. At all. \n\nApart from family dynamics, I never really knew kids younger than me growing up, so never got particularly comfortable with them (what do you **do** with them?), and they make me anxious. Obviously if they\u2019re your own you figure this out, but it doesn\u2019t add to their appeal. \n\nThe ADHD part is probably that life feels hard enough to get through when the only one I\u2019m taking care of is me (well, also my spouse, but he\u2019s an independent adult). I can\u2019t imagine adding the responsibility of children into that. (I know my husband may end up needing more support at some point in the future, which I\u2019ll deal with if it happens. Doesn\u2019t mean I want to purposefully take on the work of having kids.)\n\nThough really the issue is lack of interest. I have cats and take spectacular care of them, but I like cats. If I wanted kids, I\u2019d have kids regardless of the ADHD. I just don\u2019t want them. \n\n(Also, this isn\u2019t anything personal against kids! We were all kids once, kids are people, I love hearing about my friends\u2019 kids and cheering them on, I don\u2019t care if your kid is melting down on the plane or in a restaurant because basically we\u2019ve all been that kid at some point in our lives, even the people who swear they weren\u2019t, and listening to the kid melting down is way better than having to deal with the kid melting down. I\u2019m not anti-child, just anti-having kids of my own.)",

Dealt with periods of extreme burnout, sometimes for years. Been going to therapy for around the last 10 years, and it has helped a lot, but I struggle every day. Combine all of that with a slew of health issues, and I don\u2019t want kids. They\u2019re annoying, overstimulating, and require constant attention that I just cannot provide. I\u2019ve literally made sounds of disgust out loud in public upon hearing kids screaming or telling them to shut up. Nope. Not for me.",

I\u2019ve always been iffy about kids but the last 5ish years i\u2019ve been telling myself that i wanted them eventually, just not this decade. Recently, however, I\u2019ve been more on the fence about it. Seeing where our political, social, and environmental climate is moving towards\u2026. It just seems like the best decision not to. I also want to be able to give them the same quality of life and opportunities my parents gave me but in this economy? Also doesn\u2019t seem likely without immense sacrifice.\n\nI also identify with OP, i love the extra time to myself after work, being able to play video games without another human being being entirely dependent on me, and not having to choose between diapers or buying something for myself. \n\nSomeone said if it\u2019s not an immediate yes, then it\u2019s a no, and i\u2019m getting comfortable with the idea i might never want kids. Under different economic circumstances, maybe it\u2019d be different.\n\nI\u2019m also a bit creeped out by just being pregnant and giving birth. It\u2019s giving body horror",
