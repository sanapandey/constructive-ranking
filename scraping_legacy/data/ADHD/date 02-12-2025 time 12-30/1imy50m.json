    "selftext": "(Warning: suicidal thoughts) I am a student, 19 M from India. Life was fine till I was unaware. I always thought, \"maybe things aren't great now, but they will eventually get better.\" I started noticing that I was slowly going bald. Oh great, now I am bald and homosexual in a third world country. What will love me? Anyways I can always earn enough and move to a different country. Sigh, just after that I found out I always showed symptons of ADHD. That's why I could never use my full potential. Waiting for a better future felt stupid. I come from an abusive household. My father too, I believe, has undiagnosed ADHD. And to top it all of, I am also financially weak. I am also heavily undernourished. Right now, this feels absurd. Like how unfair life can be. All my dreams shattered. Can't carry a hobby for a long time. I always dreamt big. My parents are heavily dependent on me. My mother struggled so much after marriage. She did her best to raise me. I wish I could just end things. My life turned upside down after 2025. This is not the life I wanted to live. I have nowhere to go.",

            "body": "I'm sorry you're going through all this. One thing I'd say is that ADHD is not the thing that determines the course of your life. It has an effect, sure. It's something to learn to manage. But it's not the sole \"This determines how I will live\"\n\nAnd as one queer guy to another, the bald bit matters less than how you think of yourself and carry yourself - You're 19. You're barely an adult. You've got to take some time to figure yourself out. Dan savage has a great \"It gets better\" series, if that's a direction you're struggling with. Figure out who you are, and how to show it, and how to find your community. I understand it's probably rougher in India for that than, say, where I am, but if you can, safely, meet people, do so. Ideally in person.  Don't go in looking for romance right away, go looking for community.  \n  \nFiguring yourself out won't magically fix everything, but it helps. It also helps the ADHD - if you think of it as a computer, your brain is basically running the \"Self hatred\" program, the \"Anxiety about the future program\" and the \"Whatever I need to do to work, live, etc program\", on ADHD hardware, which is not good at running lots of things at the same time. If you can shut some of those down, or schedule them, it gets less overwhelming.",

                    "body": "As a balding gay man (haha) with ADD I fully agree with this comment. Do follow those tips.\n\nI'd like to add something more general:\n\nOver time, I\u2019ve realized everything comes down to first self-compassion; being mild to yourself, especially on rough days. And then self-love\u2014not just accepting yourself, but truly loving yourself, including your flaws. And that\u2019s harder than it sounds, but it\u2019s the only way. I've developed that mindset by reading lots of spiritual books.\n\nStop wasting energy comparing yourself to others. It doesn\u2019t matter if it feels like the whole world is \u201cnormal\u201d and you\u2019re not\u2014because that\u2019s simply not true. Everyone is fucking normal. You have to let go of the idea that you need to become like other people or how you\u00a0think\u00a0they are. That\u2019s not what life is about. Your life is about you and no one else.\n\nFor a long time, I thought this was just a comforting lie, an easy way out. But it\u2019s not. I\u2019ve tried everything, and it always comes back to this: you have to shut off that self-hatred program and the anxiety that tells you, you\u00a0should\u00a0be a certain way.\n\nWhy waste even a second of your limited time on earth feeling sad, disappointed, or unworthy? It\u2019s just not worth your energy. Feel motivated to progress and develop yourself, but always remember that you're already good enough as you are.",

It's ok to feel and have these thoughts but they don't define you. \ud83d\udc99 I hope you feel better soon. \ud83d\udc99",

Try to hold out until you finish your degree. And work on moving out. It's going to be a slow process. \n\nNow that you know you have ADHD, it's a start. It's not great but atleast you have an explanation for how your mind works. There are a lot of resources you can look up to learn to manage your ADHD. This community is great!\nTry to get an appointment with your school/college counselor. It should be free. Therapy definitely helps.\n\nIf you find it hard, DM me. I'm also from India, I can connect you with a couple of resources/people. \n\nAbove is sort of like a long term thing. Right now talk to someone you trust. Write it out. Scream. Exercise like crazy. Any safe outlet for your misery. \n\nI come from a similar background and  I understand it's easier said than done. But take care of yourself.  Things really do change. Things can change. There is hope",

But this helped me and it might not be popular advice...\n\n\"It's almost laughable.\"\n\nYou have an opportunity here that almost no one gets.  \n\nIt feels like you're the punch line in a joke that the universe is playing, right? \n\nThere's a way to reframe this that changed my life, so far forever (I was suicidal when I was 16. I'm about to turn 56 and am actually grateful for that time.)\n\nThe joke the universe is playing isn't \"at your expense\" it's something you're a part of.\n\nDon't let it all be \"laughing AT you.\"\n\nLaugh with it.\n\nWhen you're a PART of the joke then you're not a victim of it.\n\n> What will love me?\n\nStart with you.\n\n> I have nowhere to go.\n\nBut up.\n\nI don't know if you're a journaler or not. Your mileage may vary, of course.  But I can only say what helped me with any authority:\n\n- Write it ALL down.  Make a list.  It's horrible.  And maybe you can't do it in one sitting (though you should probably try.)  The trick is to get to a point where you're satisfied that \"at least the big stuff\" is on the list (add more as it comes to you.)\n\nThen attack the list.  I don't mean that you'll be able to fix everything all at once, that's silly.\n\nBut what I've always found is that the heavy emotional weight of that kind of depression comes quite frequently from letting my thoughts run in circles.  If I write it out, it kinda...HAS to progress.  Otherwise I'd just be writing the same thing over and over again, and that would be obvious.  \n\nPeople who \"have it made\" at a young age never learn the hard lesson and frequently spend a LOT of their lives being very fragile because they're afraid of loss.  Those who experience loss, pain, and hardship early on and work their way out of it have a bedrock of identity that can't be shaken and have the potential to great richness in spirit and life because they know what the opposite is.\n\nBest of luck to you and, hopefully my little rantlet here has pulled in the right direction at least a little bit.  You really DO \"got this.\"  Just don't try and tackle it all at once.\n\no7",

My job requires a lot of focus and attention to detail and like half the people that work there are all on adderall or just raw dogging life like me. ADHD is just gonna be a downer if you look at it that way, now at least that you are aware you have ADHD you can check yourself and notice when you're getting distracted. It's a challenge of course, but life is better when you know it's not just you, and its something that you can manage. I used to feel that my life would be better if I didn't have ADHD, but ADHD is the reason I'm so creative, it's the reason I am interested in so many things, try to use it to your advantage. ADHD does not make your life actively worse, it just makes it different and more interesting, more challenging but worth it, there's not a day I'm not thankful for ADHD making me individual.",

It had ruined my life in other aspects to be fair, I ruined my academics in K-12 because I never got diagnosed (probably for the better I was diagnosed an adult though so I knew how to deal with it). Lost some friends and girlfriends over it (and I still do haha), but god, it's filtered fake friends who don't care and shown me the real ones that love me for me at the same time, I'm fortunate to be surrounded by the realest people, and pick off the ones that don't really mess with me. When I was in school the most popular kids probably had some form of ADHD tbf, they were charasmatic and funny lol, always getting into trouble and just hanging around their clicks of people like them. I know it sounds like I'm saying\"just be happy!\" but all I'm really saying is that ADHD doesn't have to make your life miserable, it can be the answer to why you do things that annoy people. Undiagnosed ADHD in my opinion DOES make your life actively worse though. Not knowing what you have and thinking it's just you is so shitty because you don't know what is wrong with you, to me though ADHD is manageable. I know no one really feels this way, but to me it feels like a gift :/ call me crazy.",

It's what makes me, me. If you feel having ADHD makes your life hard, that's not to say it has to make it worse, like terminal illness or chronic pain... me, even now I make mistakese easily, I have trouble making long term relationships cause I often forget stuff about people, things that are easier for other people are typically harder for me, but I just love who I am as a person so much, I love the people around me, I love my life, and none of that would be the same if I didn't have ADHD I don't think. I genuinely in my own opinion believe that my life would've been for the worse had I not had been born with combined adhd. Before I was diagnosed I hated myself because I believed I was just an idiot that  couldn't do shit right until I decided to get seek a diagnosis (twice)  because my whole family has it. Then after I had gotten diagnosed I was even more bummed out for awhile but eventually I just learned to live with it, and after more searching I just love it now, it makes it easier to live with and I hardly ever notice it like I used to, but that's not unique to me, everyone has the ability to change their perspective on ADHD but I think it's only possible in a good environment as well, that's not to say I have a comfy life, it's just I have so much other important stuff to worry about ADHD is really not that important to me.\n\nI do apologize for that comment about everyone having it though lol, I totally thought the number was like 50% which was just wrong, but regardless of how many people have it, there's troves of communities and examples that help people get over this type of stuff.",
