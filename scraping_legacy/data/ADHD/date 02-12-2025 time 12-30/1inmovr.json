    "selftext": "I think most of you might have had similar experiences where you once start being productive, you notice that the the productivity peak just keeps rising and you get a lot done. But once you sit down to rest, you just spend the whole day doomscrolling or just doing nothing. \n\n\nI have read advices on how the best solution to tackle this is to AVOID SITTING DOWN expecially at home. But as someone a bit underweight like me who gets tired easily (working on it), what can i do to take breaks or rest? Walking is just another activity, it doesn\u2019t feel like rest, unless i sit down or lay down. I work from home too. Help me please!",

I\u2019m very motivated by sweets, which isn\u2019t the healthiest, but I\u2019m very healthy otherwise so I don\u2019t sweat it too much. Example:\n\n1.  Clean up doom-pile in the bedroom \n2.  10 minute rest/break \n3.  1 Fun Size Snickers\n4.  Open mail, have 1 M&M. Repeat until finished. \n\nHope that helps. I concur, that sitting is a motivation killer.\n\nYouTuber Jessica McCabe (How to ADHD) has a great video on what she calls The Wall of Awful and another titled Motivation Bridge. I\u2019ve found those to be really helpful.",

            "body": "I find that I sit down (or worse - I sit down and my cat sits on my lap) and just can't bring myself to get up, and I need to switch up methods to motivate myself and purposefully break my inertia to make getting up easier\n\nI start by, as anyone else, making a list of everything I need to do in the next 24-48 hours, including homework for courses I have, shopping, cooking, taking medicine, everything.\n\nI then try to mentally route the \"cleanest\" route - I can go shopping either before therapy, or after. What do I need to shop? Can I take stuff with me or do I need to rush to freeze meat? This also gets me to make lists of buying for shopping. This includes routing buses and such, and even things around the house (if I'm going to do laundry, and I have a clean pajama, I should clean the kitty litter before laundry so I can put the current dirty set in and not immediately sit on the floor with the new one)\n\nPlanning to this exact level of detail keeps me on low-inertia, and makes moving between tasks easier\n\nDon't get me wrong I still forget shit, usually taking out the trash and cleaning the bathroom, but I get 90% of stuff done like this\n\nAnd then, after I have my detailed plan, I just add line breaks in the list to indicate 30-40 minute breaks on the recliner (during which I can do whatever) and add titles for what day has what task\n\nThe thing is, I try to take breaks just whenever, to \"practice\" breaking into and out of inertia, and that makes doing single tasks easier.\n\nObviously doing all of this while medicated - that's why I think I can break out of rest slightly easier, and I'm trying to teach my brain to not associate rest with laziness guilt...\n\nIdk, this is what currently works for me, but like most methods it might stop after a month or two",
