    "selftext": "I am a parent to a child (6) who was recently diagnosed with ADD. Since my child was little I had noticed things, but it took talking to multiple people to have it taken seriously. She has struggled a lot in school with learning, even though I know she is very smart. Now that we have a diagnosis I want to assist her as much as possible. That leads to my question, what do you wish your parents did differently? Were there things that adults did/said that made you not feel heard? Advice that you heard a lot that you felt was incorrect? Were there certain things that you feel ADHD helped you with? I want to be an advocate for my child, so any feedback is appreciated!",

All I could've wished for was a parent who actually took me to a psychiatrist and got me tested rather than just forcing me into \"emotional training\" classes where I was shown emojis and asked what emotions they were showing.   \nIn all honesty, the best thing you can do is validate their experiences, comfort them when they need it, and let them be frustrated and angry when they need to be. Prove to them that you are a safe person to come to when they mess up - kids with ADHD are more likely to feel extreme anxiety about small mistakes or failures. If anyone ever implies your child should just \"try harder\" or \"focus more\" or anything along those lines, defend them from it. Those statements are used to guilt and shame children that are already struggling more than others, and are just harmful overall.   \nThings that actually helped me were eating good full breakfasts (basically impossible since I hated mornings), and lots of time outside running around or doing something active, even though I have primarily innattentive type. When switching tasks, try to give a warning buffer - \"in 20 minutes it will be dinner time\"- so your child can prepare to stop what they're doing.   \nAlso, be kind to yourself here, it's genuinely hard to raise any kid, and ADHD doesn't make it easier. You're doing a great job.",

She isn't very hyper in general, but she definitely has problems focusing, especially with academics. We are fortunate her school has more breaks than most, extended recess, outdoor time, and activities, so hopefully that helps. We are unfortunately dealing with her teacher being rather unhelpful. The comments we have had from her is frustration over my daughter asking for directions multiple times. She seems more annoyed than understanding.",

            "body": "Getting a diagnosis and treatment is huge! \n\nNot something I wish they'd done differently, rather something that my parents did well and that I wish more parents would do! I don't know how to exactly quantify or qualify it, but they really encouraged my curiosity and taught me how to learn. If there was something I was interested in (which, turns out I have ADHD, so it makes sense that I constantly had new hyperfixations), rather than dismissing it or trying to just explain it to me and move on, they'd engage. \n\nI don't remember a lot of details of specifically how or what they'd do, but generally, I just felt empowered to go do and learn on my own. If there was something I was curious about, rather than just say what they knew, my parents would say \"let's go find out.\" They'd go with me to the basement to find the relevant encyclopedia and help me find all the information I wanted, they encouraged my asking followup questions and were comfortable saying \"I don't know the answer to that. Maybe if you go check X, Y, and Z, you could find an answer.\"\n\nI didn't know I have ADHD until my 30s, but that felt like the perfect way to harness it rather than fight against it. Rather than fighting against hyperfixations to focus on the thing that someone else insisted was the most important, they helped me channel my energy and interest in a productive way that still accomplished the necessary learning goals.",

            "body": "Personally, i wish my parents would've informed themselves more. Their knowledge about AD(H)D is based on what Doctors told them, what my Ergotherapist suggested and my mom's personal experiences, since she also has ADD. But that also creates the Problem of \"I don't struggle with it, so it can't be AD(H)D-related\". I spent a lot of my time researching AD(H)D, what is it, what helps, what forms of treatments are there (i went to Ergotherapy, so i did some research, when i heard most people medicate), do i have higher risks of things like Alzheimers, Addiction ect.? Those are things you won't know unless you do research or ask questions. Music for example. It can help AD(H)D'er focus, but my mom always turned it of saying \"Bullsh*t, Music doesn't help anyone focus, it's just a distraction\" When i got older (i got diagnosed in elementary school) and started doing research it wasn't hard to find studies on it.\n\nEdit: Adults usually have enough education to know what a Attention Deficit is. What made me feel unheard where usually kids my age, when i told them i have ADD and their answer was \"No you don't\" because i don't fit their image if a stereotypical, hyperactive, \u2728\ufe0fquirky\ud83e\udd2a\u2728\ufe0f-kid. \nAnother thing maybe worth mentioning is that noone ever mentioned it again, after i was done with Ergotherapy so i eventually forgot. I blamed myself for symptoms until the topic came up in 8th grade and my mom told me i had ADD. That's when is started doing research and finally understood there's a reason i forget my homework regularily and take HOURS to get it done.",

            "body": "I actually journaled about this years ago. These are just the top few from about 20-30 and what I try to focus on with my kids now. They are nearly all to do with emotional regulation:\n\n\\- To be constantly reassured that its ok to have strong emotions and feelings eg anger, crying. To be shown how to express them in healthy and practical ways. To not be told to \"Be quiet\" if I was being loud and having fun. Not to be told to \"Stop crying\" or even \"It's ok, you don't have to cry\". Let the emotions out and just hold them or give them space. Suppression of emotions when younger leads to depression in adults who end up not knowing how to get rid of them in healthy ways. So we turn to unhealthy ways like alcohol, drugs, doomscrolling, isolating etc  \n  \n\\- To be validated and truly listened to with their full attention because every single feeling is important, even smaller ones like being nervous or anxious. Listening to their opinions and likes/ dislikes. Engaging and encouraging the things they like. Not forcing them to do something that feels unnatural just to conform or make others comfortable at the expense of your own. Trust your body. For example, if you say you're full and can't eat all your dinner, I will believe you. We'll keep it for later.\n\n\\- To hear them say sorry to me when they show strong emotions. To take responsibility for your actions and not make excuses or deflect blame. To show that it's ok to make mistakes and show their own vulnerability to people you are close to. \n\n\\- To be told that their love was unconditional towards me. They will always be there to support every decision I make without judgement. Support with career choices or hobbies which may not what they had envisaged for me. Friendships or relationships with people who they might think aren't right for me. To be a guide, not a force.\n\n\\- To know that however badly I have messed up or made a mistake, whether intentional or not, I could trust that I can confide and be vulnerable with them without feeling any judgement or guilt. I always promise my kids that I will never be mad at them, whatever they done, as long as they come and tell me or admit afterwards. I keep on following through with that and they are always surprised.\n\nI have a bunch more including practical things like setting boundaries with people, splitting up work to not feel overwhelmed, importance of getting enough sleep, diet and exercise etc. Mostly things I still struggle with practically and that I don't want them to suffer with when they are older.",

But as the mother of a 6 year daughter who was diagnosed last year, I recommend looking into getting her an IEP or 504. If her teacher hasn\u2019t been supportive maybe talk to a staff member at the school you trust? Even after I submitted her official evaluation report stating she was diagnosed, I had to really push to get the ball rolling on the SCHOOL\u2019S evaluation. Her IEP was approved and started being implemented after the holiday break and it\u2019s been SO much better for her since. Hope this helps, keep up the great work!",

            "body": "I think it\u2019s great to recognize that ADHD is a disability. You wouldn\u2019t fuss at a kid in crutches about not being able to walk like other kids, why fuss at ADHD kids for being disabled? Encouragement is really crucial here, and acknowledging that hey this stuff may be harder for you than some kids. Reassure that you as a parent are there for support and guidance, not judgement as they will get plenty of that elsewhere. \n\nAdvocating for your child in school is also essential. If I had an ADHD child in school I would also advocate for no homework in elementary school. PERIOD. Trying to navigate school all day is hard enough, no reason to send a child with a learning disability home with even more work to do. It\u2019s just sadistic. ADHD kids need a break and time for hobbies and to let their little brains run free. (I have heard of parents citing studies and talking with docs to get the school to comply) \n\n\nI mention school because being made to feel lazy and/or irresponsible crushed me as a kid. Like I prayed to god to take me to heaven when I was like 8, because the shame and embarrassment made me want to die. I was constantly grounded for skipping homework etc and none of it made me stop having ADHD. The constant criticism left me a self conscious mess and left me vulnerable to abuse from other adults as a teen. \n\nWhen it comes to chores/housework do not give instructions that are just \u201cclean this up.\u201d Breaking things down like, pick up all the blocks and put the container away then when the child has finished give them a new task. This would be useful for most children but is essential for ADHDers. We\u2019ve got a poor working memory, little patience, easily overwhelmed, do things out of order etc. and that\u2019s just how our brain works. Something like \u201cclean up as much as you can before this 5 min timer goes off\u201d to gameify cleaning can help as well. And going through and graciously cleaning the last bits may be necessary sometimes. \n\nThe last thing I would say is do not be afraid of meds. Plenty of valid concerns with it, but I promise the stress of being unmedicated in school took just as many years off my life as any medication would have. Don\u2019t be afraid to try a medicine for a full 2 weeks to 1 month if the time comes. It took me a year to find a good medication schedule/dosage as an adult.",
