    "selftext": "Hello I am 17 yo and currently in education, I recently got diagnosed with ADHD privately as it was advised my GP due to the 2yr waiting period, I would like to be put on medication as I have tried other methods such as having apps or to-do list but none have been effective as I give up after a few days/weeks, I know that medication won't cure my ADHD but it's really impacted my performance in school and at home and other aspects of my life. My parents are worried about addiction, I have tried to explain to them that it's not really an addictive medication and even my doctors have said the same thing, I have talked to my mom and after 2mnths of convincing she reluctantly agreed to let me try medication for a week (not much but at least its something) but my dad is very stubborn and once he sets his mind on something he doesn't listen to anyone and thinks he's always right (at-least thats what he seems like to me). I understand his concerns and understand he's only trying to look out for me, trying to do whats best for me, I have tried to be understanding but it's getting annoying, how can I Convince him.",
