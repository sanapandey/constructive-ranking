I'm not a doctor, and definitely don't play one on TV, but *this* is the kind of thing I'd get a second opinion on. Get your heart checked, sure, but if your heart's not healthy enough for sex on Adderall, then I can only imagine it's not healthy enough for Adderall either. Something's fucky (and right now it ain't OP).",

Also, some ADHD meds can increase your libido so\u2026 I think it\u2019s kind of odd for her to say something like that.",

And in reality, it would probably be fine anyway. But I\u2019m paranoid and overly cautious lol. You can usually feel when your heart rate is still being effected by your meds. For me it only happens for an hour after I take a dose (I take IR).  Very easy to avoid any strenuous activity during that time, and still live your life the way you normally do with no interruptions or straight up avoiding strenuous activity 24/7.\n\nI will point out though, as a nursing student, there\u2019s soooo many times where I have to take a dose at clinicals where I\u2019m running around, potentially helping deal with a health emergency, etc - all activities that keep me in a constant state of near panic (how I function best lol). And think about all the physical jobs people on ADHD meds likely do. Construction, plumbing, HVAC - I promise these people don\u2019t quit their jobs just bc of their meds lol",
