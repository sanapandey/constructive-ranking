    "selftext": "So, I've always had this habit of getting a specific phrase or sentence in my head, seemingly at random, and compulsively saying it. I'm not thinking about it repeatedly, but if I'm talking with someone and there's a pause or silence, I will sometimes just compulsively say the phrase, without thinking about it. Sometimes they're call-and-response behaviors with friends (we have one where one of us will like. Chomp on air and the other person will do it back). It's usually only one or two at a time, but they can stick around for months-years. I usually don't say the phrase when I'm alone. They do occasionally annoy me. \n\nThey can be from media or seemingly spontaneously generated. \n\n Examples include:\n\n\"yeetum skeetum, my dudes\" (no clue where it came from but it stayed for years)\n\"I'm just a fucking kid\" (the beginning of a caillou parody intro song that I actually hate)\n\"Your mom [repeats whatever the other person just said]\" \n\"Viktor-nation, how we feeling?\" (Most recent, I think this one stayed bc it has an associated accent that I find pleasing?)\n\"Mr. Sandman, man me a sand\" (from a tumblr post?)\nAforementioned air-biting call-and-response\n\"Beep beep\" (like a fucking car?)\n\nAnd so many more. Is this echolalia? I'm not repeating them all the time, so I'm not sure if it counts. Does anyone have another name for this behavior? People have noticed and commented on it, and i have absolutely no idea what's causing it. ",

            "body": "I consider this to be along the same vein for me as getting a song stuck in my head, because, like the phrase, I will randomly start blurting out or humming the current song to fill a silence.\n\nI think echolalia is more of an immediate repetition of words or phrases as you hear them, rather than getting a phrase stuck in your head and repeating it in intervals over time.\n\nI reckon what you\u2019re describing has more to do with hyperfixation or rumination because that\u2019s when it becomes difficult take your mind off something and it is sometimes all consuming to the point of needing to blurt it out. Maybe? A reminder that ADHD isn\u2019t the lack of focus but the inability/difficulty to control the amount and direction of focus.",

Maybe it does have something to do with hyperfixation in some way. \n\nI also just do not get songs stuck in my head for this long. The phrases can last for years and sometimes overlap.",
