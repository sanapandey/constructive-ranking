    "selftext": "How do you function when you\u2019re alone? For me. I usually feel like I\u2019m a loner and having ADHD makes it even more worse. I got so used to being with friends, going to events, and then playing sports and hobbies daily. I used to work out a lot as well. But a few years back something changed in me. Maybe it was depression or something else. When I\u2019m alone I get bored of playing video games. I can\u2019t sit still while watching tv or even watch tv shows like I used to. I also made YouTube videos for fun but now that gets boring. I can only function when I\u2019m being active. I used to enjoy playing video games and used to enjoy tv shows. I hate reading books but may need to start trying to. How do you all manage when alone? ",
