Inability to start tasks until the last minute when you can use anxiety and panic to get started is a telltale symptom. \n\nAt least it\u2019s just boring tasks that are like that. Fun things that feel impulsive are easier. One thing to try is incentivizing the obligation with a treat or something impulsive at the end. ADHD brains like games and making it a game can trick the brain.",
