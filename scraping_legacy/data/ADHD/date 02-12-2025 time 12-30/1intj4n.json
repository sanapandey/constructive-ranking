    "selftext": "I am!  And my shoulders are never relaxed.... and it makes my migraines more frequent.  Also poor sleep, dental problems, neck pain, etc. etc. etc.   I finally found a nice easy stretch/massage routine that seems to help the physical symptoms created by the clenching/shoulder tension/etc to which many of us are prone.  Did these over the weekend and I swear the symptoms created by both the teeth clenching & the shoulder tension were so much better.  Hope this can help somebody!  \n     \n[https://youtu.be/DVebkG8aDG4?si=VLf0dWY1oqasUxnL](https://youtu.be/DVebkG8aDG4?si=VLf0dWY1oqasUxnL)   SCM stretch/massage  \n[https://youtu.be/Wzw-1Sl\\_y-A?si=dj4SsFwvMXR37XqB](https://youtu.be/Wzw-1Sl_y-A?si=dj4SsFwvMXR37XqB)same SCM stretches with more in depth explanation  \n[https://youtu.be/\\_f0jjpWp9NA?si=WoUumRrvfENwbsIi](https://youtu.be/_f0jjpWp9NA?si=WoUumRrvfENwbsIi)neck & upper traps.  used the massage technique from the video above while doing this stretch too.  \n",
