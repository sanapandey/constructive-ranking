I\u2019d contribute it to RSD, I hate when I\u2019m hyper/passionate about something and someone tells me to calm down or quiet down, it makes me feel guilty for even being excitable in the first place. In debates I can get passionate and loud which can be seen as aggressive (that\u2019s what my boyfriend has told me LOL) which also leads to people telling me to cool it.",

I analyze pretty much 90% of my conversations, regardless or topic, and scold myself for taking too much space, talking excessively, etc. Being excited makes it 10x worse. \n\nI remember getting a comment from a lecturer at uni college, something along the lines of \"You don't like raising your hand, do you?\" as I spoke out of turn/without raising my hand (and I have to say, they did not mean to scold me per se), and I just decided there and then to not say anything for the next period of time, in order to give other students space and time, but primarily because I felt like such an asshole!\n\nI must note that I'm also very sensitive, and have always been, so my highs are very high, and lows very low, and it can change in an instant. That happens pretty much every day for no obvious reason.\n\nI can also be sad about not having a group of friends, yet cut off any attempt at being social as \"too much hassle\", then get pissed at myself for declining (rinse and repeat). \n\nThe excessive talking when I get going also doesn't help explaining to others that I'm ACTUALLY an introvert, as in I need to recharge by myself and get drained by being social. So I might find myself in the middle of a game with friends, after my own initiative, and then just immediately crash out of the blue. \n\nSo yeah, can relate!",
