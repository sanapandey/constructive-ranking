    "selftext": "So, emotional disregulation is a 'feature' of ADHD for some people and I am one of those. I have worked hard my entire life to rein the emotions in, even before I was diagnosed about a yeah and a half go. But I just can't seem to control it once it hits a certain level.\n\nI've had feedback at work on previous projects that I \"seem stressed and flustered\", and am currently being told that for me to progress I need to learn how to moderate my feelings in front of clients. Which - yes I completely understand!\n\nTo be clear - I am not in a situation where I'm going off the rails at people and shouting or swearing and things. I think it's more the facial expressions and body language and vocal tone that's the problem.\n\n  \nBut... given that I am already trying really really hard... am I just not trying hard enough? Work keep asking me what they can do to help me and I just don't know what to say to them anymore :( because I am already trying as hard as I think I can. I don't know what else I'm supposed to do. I've TRIED not feeling things and bottling them up - it just means the release is delayed and more.. explosive. I don't know how to separate myself from my emotions and it has now completely halted my career. I will not be able to progress now no matter how good I am at my job, because of my emotions.\n\n  \nI want to be able to be one of those amazing calm people who just always seem to be assertive and calm and... I don't understand why I can't control my emotions :(\n\nSo - what have you guys done? Have any of you been in a similar situation and what did you do?",

            "body": "Adhd fucks with my emotions, too. It can be terrible. I cry every morning until I take my Vyvanse. I sometimes even cry for up to an hour afterwards. Are you medicated?\n\nAt work, however, when I did work before bipolar and adhd took over my life, I masked. I would never explode or show any emotion other than happiness at work. Like many ADHDers, it\u2019s hard for me to hide what I\u2019m feeling because it\u2019s written all over my face. Nevertheless, to me, it\u2019s inappropriate behavior that can be managed by using the CBT strategies I\u2019ve learned. You can learn to manage and separate yourself from your emotions with a little effort. I am hyper aware of my responses and, when possible, my facial expressions. That could be because I\u2019ve been called out so many times. It\u2019s embarrassing for me to show my \u201ccards\u201d on my face. \n\nYou need to be aware of the effect you\u2019re having on others. No offense, but after asking so many times how to help you, I would let you go. It\u2019s not fair to the other employees who shouldn\u2019t have to worry about how you come off to clients.",

                    "body": "Yes I'm now medicated (for about 3 months now) and it has definitely helped.\n\nI should clarify... I am lucky to work for a very progressive company who go wayyyy above and beyond in terms of support. I don't think (... god i hope they haven't been hiding anything like this from me... I already assume I'm about to be fired any time I speak to anyone managerial....) I am anywhere near this causing me to be fired. It's more that I currently can't be put in positions any more senior because they don't want to risk me getting emotional - which is understandable and reasonable if frustrating for me.\n\nReally, they are very much trying to help me - they're telling me they want to be able to promote me but can't and they want to help me. I have just come out of a meeting with my manager where he said very close to that phrase.\n\nI agree that things like facial expressions can be considered inappropriate, and that's why I'm after some advice/tips on what I can do to try harder :( I love my job and I get consistent feedback that I'm good... I would really like to be able to live up to my potential :(",

They can be very helpful in helping you to engage your executive function. \n\nI\u2019ve run some very progressive offices, and, given my own history with mental conditions, I try to be as helpful as possible when encouraging my reports to put their mental health first. That said, I only have so much patience and my bosses had even less.",
