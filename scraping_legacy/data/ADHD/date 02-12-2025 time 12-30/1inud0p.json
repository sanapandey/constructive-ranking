    "selftext": "Sounds simple enough, you would think. But oh man I (27 female) have a hard time not blurting out my own thoughts in conversation, interrupting them. \n\nShort background: I never noticed this was a problem until I became an adult. As kid I was intensely shy and didn\u2019t speak much to people so I only had a few friends and my parents (or anyone really) never told me it was rude to interrupt people (lets just say I had zero help with my mental health growing up and was given no tools to help - my parents believed i\u2019d grow out of it.) So this basically went unchecked until college, when I became somewhat more socially aware, had more friends, talked more.\n\nIn conversations with other people, most people don\u2019t interrupt me. I\u2019m mad at myself because I can\u2019t seem to give them that same respect. It would probably bother me if I were them, so how the heck do I stop? Ugh, im worried people won\u2019t want to talk to me if I\u2019m like this - I don\u2019t want them to feel like I\u2019m not paying attention to them or that I don\u2019t care. \n\nI will sometimes catch myself doing it but sometimes its too late and at point I\u2019ve already ruined their flow by making a noise or looking like I have something to say (different issue just not being able to control my facial expressions - idk if this is because I was socially stunted being so freaking shy lmao - it also sucks) And now I have a newish problem - if I don\u2019t interrupt - it is genuinely hard to concentrate on what they are saying because my brain hate me and its like an itch to say what I want to say. Fuuuuckking hell\n\nDo other people struggle with this? If so how have you been able to improve yourself? How do you stop that itch in your brain? ",

Before he made me the ring, I would literally bite my own tongue (not hard), just enough on the tip to keep my tongue from flapping without my brains permission lol. Hubs said it made me look funny in social situations which is why he made the ring lmfao",
