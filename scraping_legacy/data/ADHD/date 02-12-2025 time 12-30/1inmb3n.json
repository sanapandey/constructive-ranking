I usually have 1-2 \u201csafe\u201d people I seem to be totally fine with messaging all the time, but everything else feels overwhelming and I usually avoid it for weeks. Avoiding it obviously makes me feel guilty, especially as I do it regarding people I want to talk to as well.. and from there it\u2019s a slippery slope into total isolation.\n\nI think I\u2019ve seen more people talk about it previously, so I like to think it\u2019s common, but damn it sucks.",

It\u2019s slightly easier, but I still leave some for weeks. I also try to trick myself into it. It\u2019s difficult to explain but I sort of just tell myself I\u2019m not gonna do it, while at the same time clicking into the messages and replying as quickly as possible. Sometimes my replies will be left as drafts though so it\u2019s not an ideal method haha",

            "body": "Whatsapp is horrible. Especially because it gets abused by employers to reach you after work. When I have a new job I always say I don't appreciate being contacted after work, or I straightout lie I don't have whatsapp. If people add me to groups I exit the group immediately because when I try to archive it they put the archived conversations at the top of whatsapp and not at the bottom. So I am still bothered by numbers of unread messages. In the end I have removed whatsapp and installed telegram or signal. Both of these apps seem to have an etiquette. It's weird but it seems so. No overflow on messages, in groups people tend to moderate to only send messages about the subject of the group so no public shaming of sorts because they tell you in a private conversation.  Whatsapp became Facebook messenger, only they only need your phone number instead of sending a request so it's worse. It's really weird but friends who keep on texting on whatsapp just don't on signal and I know they use signal also, for me this is a relief",

I am in 5 which are small and just moderately active, so I seldom get flooded with messages. \n\nA big pro is that they can be effective in communication for group activities. I have a small group chat with my parents and my GF which we mostly use to pick a date to visit each other. When I'm busy doing something, my gf can easily take over the conversation, or she can easily chime in when I'm not able to look into her agenda. \n\nOn the other hand, I have a group chat with the entire office, that I hate with a passion. Luckly it's an informal one, so no urgent work-related communication there, but that also means that most messages are someone from HR wishing a colleague a happy birthday, followed by an endless stream of others doing the same. That can go on for the entire fucking day, even on week-ends and woe to the one who doesn't chime in to wish a happy birthday as well.",
