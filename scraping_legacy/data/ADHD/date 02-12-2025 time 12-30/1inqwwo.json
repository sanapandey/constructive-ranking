    "selftext": "Hey all, I was wondering if there was a correlation between ADHD and self taught artists? \n\nI am no DaVinci at all, but I have always had the same art style, and when people compliment my art and ask how I learned... my response is always along the lines of \"oh, I just see it in my head and do it!\" Or \"oh, I pulled up a picture and did it!\"\n\nI've never sat down and attempted to learn it... it just always came natural and I'm not sure why, I wonder if it's ADHD?\n\nHave a great one yall!",

I taught myself how to play piano on YouTube because I always wanted to learn \ud83d\ude05 \n\nI think, where there's a will, there's a way. & us ADHD folks have a lot of drive when it comes to something we're interested in!! \n\nIt really is one of the best parts of this \"disorder\". If it weren't for us, the world wouldn't be even half as developed as it is!! We have great power in these minds!!",

I taught myself how to knit, crochet, embroider and cross stitch for fun and can just look at anything and make it. I learned Spanish and Italian because I thought being trilingual would be cool! I at least drop hobbies and pick them up way later but when the desire is there we just go balls deep in whatever it is.",
