I don't know all of the symptoms or whatever because Google isn't a human and I can't ask it if it also might have ADHD, and if it also a billion different hobbies, or if it also struggles with simple tasks. So I decided that posting on reddit where actual people are would be better than that.\n\nSo, recently I've been debating on whether or not I have ADHD, because I moved my room around and it only took me ONE DAY! But because of that I'm starting to doubt that I have it. A lot of people on one side of my family have ADHD, and i heard it's genetic. Anyone else feel like they're faking it sometimes?",

And I realised I do have ADHD after all, despite some severe imposter-syndrome-like feelings about it.\n\nThe fact that you moved your room in one day doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t possibly have ADHD. I would go so far as to say it could point toward it - the need for change, the sudden energy, the hyper fixation on changing your room.\n\nI would say, if you have doubts, by all means open up to at least your GP about it. They will know whom to refer you to.",

            "body": "Talk with a health professional. Whether or not it's ADHD you might be able to get some help with processing whatever you experience, and maybe even get some advice and tools.\n\nUltimately, getting help if you're struggling is the most important thing, not whether you have ADHD or not. \n\nMake a list of symptoms and issues you struggle with (especially if you believe they're connected), explain your concerns, and try to be open about potential causes. It would also be clever to mention that family members have ADHD. \n\nI felt terrible about screening for ADHD initially, as I felt like I was simply looking for excuses. However, I had a wonderful psychologist with experience in ADHD screening etc., and they reassured me that it's very common to experience \"imposter syndrome\" or self-loathing while going through such a procrss. After all, you're not just battling other peoples' stereotypes and judgment, but often your own as well. That takes some time to accept. I know I sure as hell am still trying my best to do just that!\n\n\n\nBest of luck!",
