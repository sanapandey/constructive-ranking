    "selftext": "If you snore, ask your doctor for a referral for a sleep study to look for sleep apnea.\n\nSleep apnea causes you to have disturbances as you sleep (i.e. you literally stop breathing) which decreases the quality of your sleep.\n\nIf you feel tired no matter how well you sleep AND wake up with headaches, you really need to get that checked out. \n\nAs an ADHDer, getting a CPAP for my sleep apnea has increased the quality of my life tremendously, and I urge you to do the same.\n\n(Reposting one of my comments on a previous thread because this is incredibly overlooked) ",
