    "selftext": "Been telling myself for over 3 years that I need to go get my freelance certification for my hairstylist license. The thing that held me back was that I had to drive 1.5 hours away and take a test\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it so many times because when I graduated beauty school 10 years ago and had to take that test, I barely passed so my brain has been telling me that I\u2019d probably fail and it would all be for nothing.\nI made a decision the other day that today I would do it. So I\u2019ve been studying the material and felt fully prepared! I woke up early, drove down there and GUESS WHAT?! The laws have changed and I didn\u2019t even have to take the test!! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I just had to pay a fee and that was it! \n\nBIG WIN FOR ME!!\n",

I can relate to your situation, I procrastinated taking the written test for my driver's license for years because the study material was boring and I was scared I'd fail, but it ended up being really easy lmao. The fear of failure can make it really hard to start (even if the task is \"easy\"), and it's an awesome feeling when you finally finish and have that weight off your chest. Anyways, congrats on getting it done, and good luck in your career!",
