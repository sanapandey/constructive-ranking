    "selftext": "Aside from the usual everyday forgetfulness of switching laundry, dishes, trying to find things and so on. Does anybody else forget to breathe? I'll exhale and forget in inhale. When I finally take a deep breath I get asked if I'm OK. I also forget that I'm hungry and forget to eat. People think I'm crazy and don't understand how someone can forget to eat. The one thing I never forget is drinking water. Anyone else experiencing this? ",
