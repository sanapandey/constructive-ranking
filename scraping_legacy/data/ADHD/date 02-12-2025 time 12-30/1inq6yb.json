It\u2019s extremely tiring both for everyday life as well as professional, I just couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.\n\nI was very happy to share I\u2019ve found a fantastic therapist to accompany me along side with medication i will get from my psychiatrist (in 2 weeks). Like, I\u2019m really working on it guys \ud83d\ude02\n\nThe response I\u2019ve got was \u201cthere, you see, you are immediately turning to medication when these things can perfectly be fixed with a good therapist. I think you should change the therapist and just pull your shit together and focus\u201d\n\nPull your shit together and focus\u2026 \n\nCan someone please give me a sanity check here?",
