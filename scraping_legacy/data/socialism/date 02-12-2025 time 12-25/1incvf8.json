    "selftext": "So basically, i don't understand the complete support Stalin gets.\n\nI understand how important he was for the evolution of socialism, i understand how helped URSS ecc ecc. I know the good stuff he did. But as we all know, despite all the good things he wasn't the greatest leader under other points of view. Religious repression, gulag, political oppression etc. we all know about that, but my question is: Why do supporter ignore all of that?\n\nI obviusly support the good stuff he did, that's a no brainer, i mean i support every good stuff that any leader has done, even if maybe i don't support him as a whole.\n\nSo basically i really can't bring myself to understand why people support him as a whole and ignore the bad stuff he did. Every leader has his ups and downs, obviusly, and i totally disagree with those mf who says that he was even worse than Hitler, that's compeltly untrue, and not just from a communist point of view.\n\nI think hes revolutionary of course but again, i don't understand the complete support it gets, it confuses both me and a lot of other communist i know, i mean it's not a secret that a huge part of communist don't support him. \n\nI wanted to say that I didn't have a pro-capitalist culture growing up. I'm italian and here they mostly support mixed economy, and in school they thaught me both the flaws of communism and capitalism through history. But I also have to say that here most people still depict communist as monster and even whorse than fascist, and the culture they teach in school is mostly centrist or left-centrist, so maybe that could also affect my point of view.\n\nI beg pardon for my probably shitty english and for repeating myself so much but I really didn't know how to formulate it all. Thanks in advance to all the response and please, don't write full books as answers, keep it short and simple\n\nThanks and have a good day.",

There's already enough anti-Stalin sentiment out there, we don't need to add to it. Don't do the CIA's work for them. Have critical discussions in good faith amongst comrades. Basically, adding principled criticisms before cutting through the propagandistic nonsense is just dogpiling. \n\nI've personally been convinced to completely reconsider my idea of Stalin, but I haven't done the work yet to try to challenge others' ideas. If you want to engage in good faith, a good first step would be to choose a specific historical event and ask/dig into that. Instead of just <broadly gestures to Stalin bad narrative>.",

            "body": "Let me explain the view from Russia, at least. I was born in the USSR and my family fled to Vladivostok during the war (at least those who weren't in the military). Places like Belarus saw 1/4 of their population killed. Famine was routine, criminality was rampant, and Russians assumed that the disasters of centuries prior would never end.\n\nMy great-grandmother was born a month after Lenin's death, so all she knew was war and starvation until her 20s. By the time that she was a young woman, she had seen radical transformation of a kind unimaginable to any living American. Russia went from a peasant society in 1917 to a nuclear-armed superpower responsible for freeing the Nazi camps in 1945. (Well, the nukes came a bit later.)\n\nBy 1961, the USSR, not America, sent the first person into outer space. \n\nI don't care what your politics are, if you cannot appreciate the scope and power of such transformation by sheer human will & ingenuity, SORRY, you have zero idea of humanity's purpose and potential. You cannot underestimate the pride that was felt, and the central figure surrounding it.\n\nHad the Revolution not happened, the \"Great Game\" of the 1800s would have continued unabated, as it continues today, with far more death and destruction to show for it. There is Stalin's sociopathic destructiveness on the one hand, yet there is social murder on the other, and the latter is rarely discussed despite being the top cause of death in the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nThis is also why Putin (and Xi Jinping, for that matter) remains quite popular. Russia in the 1990s was ruled by the mafia, with murder being FOUR TIMES as high as America's peak that same decade. Putin ran a campaign in 1999, \"the dictatorship of the law\", promising a return to baseline. Russians are partly willing to overlook Putin's brutality and illiberalism for the sake of stability.\n\n[PS: if anyone is interested, I did a video essay on the catastrophic consequences of capitalism for Russia in the 1990s, using the murder of American journalist Paul Klebnikov to discuss the role of oligarchy then and now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av6WBg0ii3U) I translated a bunch of stuff which has never appeared in English before.",

The prisons and labour camps exist only for these gentlemen and only for them.\"\n\n[Apropos of the Statement of Mr. Morrison](https://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv9n2/stalin.htm)\nStalin is completely honest here, he doesn't hide that there is \"political repression\", because there's no need to. The Soviets were right to not allow the enemies of the people to act and sabotage the building of socialism. Building socialism means the continuation of class war under different conditions.\n\n\n\"It is true that in the U.S.S.R. there are no legal bourgeois parties, that only one party, the Party of the Workers, the Communist Party, enjoys legality. Have we the ways and means, however, of convincing ourselves that the majority of the workers, the majority of the masses of the toilers sympathize with the Communists? We speak of course of the masses of the workers and peasants and not of the new bourgeoisie or of the remnants of the old exploiting classes which have been already crushed by the proletariat. (...)\"\n\n[Stalin's Interview With the First American Trade Union Delegation to Soviet Russia](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1927/09/15.htm)\nStalin then goes on to prove in detail how it was possible to know, apart from the fact that the Communist Party was truly  the Party of the Workers, that the workers and other toilers were aware of that and sympathized with the Communist Party.\n\nWas Stalin perfect? Of course not. We believe in scientific socialism and communism, believing in \"perfection\" is utopian, and believing that a singular leader is perfect or a savior is against our worldview. But is it true that he was a traitor to Leninism, that he established state capitalism, that he was after innocents or that he intentionally caused famines and committed massacres? None of these are true. Stalin's quotes don't prove this, historical evidence proves it.",

And I don't mean that in a bad way, I was there too. So right now, what you should do is ask yourself what the gulags were really like, what their purpose was, and find Soviet and Marxist Leninist literature on the subject and compare to what you know and have read, and also compare to the US prison system and its purpose, affects, etc. Same thing with the political oppression you brought up - but just a quick note on that, is all political oppression bad? If you're oppressing counter revolutionaries, the bourgeoisie, or worse is that not good? For example, is it bad to politically oppress slavers? It's not like Stalin decided to oppress a political opponent for making fun of his mustache. There were a lot of external and internal forces working towards sabotaging and destroying the socialist government in order to make way for bourgeois interests - and in the end they won... but after Stalin died.

If Hitler won, German history would remember him as a brilliant statesman who expanded the German Empire and restored stability. Eventually liberal democracy would be restored, as it was in Spain (fascism is, after all, not a stable 'own' ideology, but rather an immune response of the capitalist system to revolutionaries), and they would speak of regret for \"some of the darker decisions\" made in his reign, but overall he was a net positive. Look at how the US talks about Japanese concentration camps - some tepid \"we did an oopsie\" criticism but a lot of people can look past them and call FDR a great president for what he did for \"the American people\". Think of how Americans are taught about Manifest Destiny: again, some lukewarm criticisms but an overall \"it had to be done\" tone. That's your post-victory view of Hitler.",
