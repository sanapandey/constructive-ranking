Netanyahu wasn\u2019t even born during the holocaust, so the horrible suffering the Jewish people and other groups suffered during WW2 was not experienced by him directly. \n\nRegardless, knowing the horrors of the holocaust and still proceeding with his Palestinian genocide makes him a worse person for it.\n\nHurt people hurt, yes, but hurt people don\u2019t get a free pass to take their pain out on others. Hurt people should learn from their experience and try to stop the cycles of hatred, not feed them.",

But it is an important subtext to understanding Zionism and the social dynamics in modern day Israel. \n\nMany of these people are descendants of Holocaust survivors and have inherited generations of paranoia and persecution complexes. Obviously this doesn\u2019t warrant any of their cruelty, but it does help explain why there\u2019s so much ethnic hysteria among Israelis.",
