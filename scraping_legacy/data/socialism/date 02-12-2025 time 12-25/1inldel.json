This is what labor struggle looks like when the working class doesn't idolize and worship the boots of cops. \n\nDuring this time there was also major protests in support of them in city centers that were apart of an ongoing wave of mass struggle, and disobedience in urban centers of Spain. Rubber bullets, and high intensity means of repression were used against the crowds who supported the miners, which was the norm.\n\nFor example, this is some footage from other places Spain at the same time frame:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/pleAgEx9yoc\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ieXrS3jvbUI\n\n\n\nThis wave of struggle was apart of a growing unrest in europe, which started in Greece but was apart of a wider international and decentralized organizing effort that quickly spread to places like Spain, Italy, and so forth. Fascism began to rise in response to this.\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/45UfIEIU14w\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZKyi2qNskJc\n\n",
