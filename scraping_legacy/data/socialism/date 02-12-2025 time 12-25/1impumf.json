I would definitely recommend reading his other works. Taking notes and using a reading guide helps with some of his more confusing concepts and writing.",

By Stalin \n\n- Dialectical and Historical Materialism by Stalin \n\n- The Proletarian class and the proletarian party by Stalin \n\n- Against the Fascism and the War by Dimitrov \n\n- Can Cuba survive ? By Fidel Castro \n\n- [Declaration of the Central Committee of the KKE on the 100th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution](https://inter.kke.gr/en/articles/Declaration-of-the-Central-Committee-of-the-KKE-on-the-100th-anniversary-of-the-Great-October-Socialist-Revolution/)\n\nI don't want to make this comment so long and I'm afraid I don't remember well all the books I would like at this moment. I know that more comrades will arrive with more, and better, recommendations but I think that this books are so useful to start learning (You can find all of these on the internet for free by the way).\n\nEdit, I left out some books like Marx's Capital, The development of capitalism in Russia by Lenin, etc. because although it is extremely important, I find them a very heavy and a tedious read. I think it is better to understand some basic ideas before read them.",
