These citizens were fighting to provide schools and jobs for the under supported proletariat, even though the capitalist companies are reaping record profits from the mining extraction. These citizens are also fighting for clean water and protection of what natural resources are left after decades of environmental damage due to the capitalist mining companies, and the government that supports them.",

Naxals are notorious for attacking teachers, Engineers, doctors, government employees and contractors.\n\nThey blow up roads, schools, police stations, hospitals. They try to stop any and all development project. Naxals are as responsible as the government for the stagnant growth of the region. Naxals keep the Tribals poor so they can fight for them.\n\nhttps://www.aninews.in/news/national/general-news/school-building-blown-up-by-naxals-in-bihars-gaya20200219164259/\n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/abducted-by-naxals-in-2012-ias-officer-alex-paul-menon-v-fails-to-identify-maoist/articleshow/97565422.cms\n\nhttps://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/news/india/naxals-abduct-two-italians-in-odisha/articleshow/16215207.cms\n\nhttps://www.livemint.com/news/india/chhattisgarh-engineer-worker-engaged-in-bridge-construction-abducted-by-naxals-11644589918673.html",

It\u2019s not just that India\u2019s having its own Gilded Age (though it kind of is at the moment), but that their Gilded Age is marked by non-Indian capitalists ripping the country apart and siphoning the value generated into the wallets of Western capitalists. Very little of the value produced actually stays in the country.\n\nThe scale of imperialism still blows my mind and I\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours teaching and studying it.",

                            "body": "Good question! This is why I alluded to India having their own Gilded Age moment. It\u2019s certainly hard to ignore the wealth of Ambani and Adani, especially in contrast to the desperate poverty that surrounds their ugly towers (I think Adani\u2019s the one who built that one?). Anyway, there ARE powerful Indian industrialists, especially when it comes to steel, oil, and contracting firms. The problem is that these are what people call \u2018low value-added\u2019 industries (specifically steel and oil). The profits generated by software, AI, rockets, and computer chips, etc. make those other industries look like chump change.\n\nWhen you look at high value added industries in India, they\u2019re dominated by Western companies. American Big Tech for software, American semiconductor companies for the computer chips, Walmart and Amazon for e-commerce, consumer electronics are all Japanese, Korean, and American brands.\n\nAnd this is just high value added stuff. Foreign cars have larger market share than Indian companies. Fast food is dominated by American companies. Construction equipment, trains, airplanes, and even their payment systems are all dominated by American companies.\n\nOn top of that, the country\u2019s got really bad brain drain. India\u2019s education system can pump out some quality people, but then they (specifically the top of the top) just end up working at Western companies abroad. \n\nIndia\u2019s at a crossroads right now, and they do keep moving back and forth between homegrown industries and allowing western companies to come in and do as they please. Their steel and oil production are now mostly Indian companies, which is good. But the rest of their important industries are still more or less owned/dominated by western companies, so the value generated doesn\u2019t stay in the country except for very sporadic and stunted capital re-investment. The trend under Modi seems to be toward foreign direct investment with no/very little capital controls. His Made in India initiative failed spectacularly, and it was already severely compromised from the start (most of the initiative was just joint ventures with non-Indian companies).",
