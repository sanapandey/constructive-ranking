In a few years they may rule many more countries than they currently do.\n\nDo you see socialism rising and having a comeback as a reaction against fascism?",

They are propped up by elites who either are fascists themselves or who view fascism as something they can control, and therefore push for it.\n\n\nSocialism on the other hand doesn't have very many elites willing to shill out constant propaganda for it. The result is that the right wing usually wins the propaganda war. It's totally possible that people never realize that the right wing isn't on their side or that every socialist movement just gets astroturfed or destroyed. We can't just sit around and hope that people are going to come over to our side when there are incredible forces trying to stop them from doing that constantly.",
