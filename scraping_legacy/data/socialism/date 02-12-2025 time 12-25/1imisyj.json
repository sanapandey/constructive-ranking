It is we who built these palaces and cities, here in Spain and America and everywhere. We, the workers. We can build others to take their place. And better ones. We are not in the least afraid of ruins. We are going to inherit the earth; there is not the slightest doubt about that. The bourgeoisie might blast and ruin its own world before it leaves the stage of history. We carry a new world here, in our hearts. That world is growing in this minute.\n\nBuenaventura Durruti.

The only way to solve some problems is by not looking at them as a way to make money and instead invest our efforts and resources into the lives and future of our people and planet, but the market doesn't and can't care about that.",

Moore makes the case that mainstream environmentalism in the 20th century developed as a ruling class management project. It contains opposition to environmental destruction (\"well at least we protect national parks!\"), moralises the issues in a way that constitutes a psyop against individuals (think carbon footprint nonsense) and reinforces the bourgeois nature-society divide that creates the intellectual space for most of the world's industrial destruction in the first place.\n\n\"Environmentalism serves the powerful\" \n\nhttps://thebaffler.com/latest/the-fear-and-the-fix-moore",

We can restrict environmentalism to just an excess pollution problem where consumers are often blamed for the issues but it isn't actually a) a wholistic understanding of env that doesn't just include littering but actual production of waste, and use of exploitative and harmful practices that impact the workers, the ppl and other life. Environmentalism is essentially a class struggle to make this planet livable and hospitable for everyone on this earth rather than individual effort of having a cozy garden space for yourself or driving e-vehicles etc. Without class struggle and revolutionary tactics, we'll be failing environmental movement",
