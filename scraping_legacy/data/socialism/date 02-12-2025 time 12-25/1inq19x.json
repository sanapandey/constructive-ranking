    "selftext": "Defense contractors and police can never be the friends of LGBTQ people, who are oppressed by the capitalist system they uphold and defend. Their unwelcome participation in Pride events in recent years was never anything more than a shrewd advertising and PR move to give a progressive veneer to their profiteering and warmongering. LGBTQ activists have long protested their presence and demanded their removal. \n\nWith the Trump administration and the extreme-right wing launching an all-out attack on trans rights, Pride is more important than ever as a site of struggle and a commemoration of the LGBTQ community\u2019s history of resistance to oppression. From the beginning, LGBTQ leaders have stood against US militarism at home and abroad - the very militarism that Booz Allen Hamilton profits from. \n\nImages Source: \n- https://www.instagram.com/p/DF8y5_oSdZG/\n- https://www.instagram.com/p/DFs6OgJyReH/\n\nLGBTQ+ Rights in Cuba animated video: https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/s/qX8upuJtyE\n\nLGBTQ+ Rights in Cuba images: https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/s/7glLgEVEpQ\n\nIn Cuba, abortion and all healthcare is free, and enshrined in a constitution democratically voted on by the people.
