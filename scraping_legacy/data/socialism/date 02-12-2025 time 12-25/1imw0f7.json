Even internationally, the dismantling of USAID, a major institution of American \"soft power,\" practically overnight should signal that something *may* be different. Such a situation deserves careful thought and examination. Neither is offered by this article.",

It leaves leftists hopelessly flailing in the dark.\u00a0\n\n\nNow they have blinded themselves so strongly that they are imagining \"international leftists\" and that American debt is proof of weakness while also believing that China is somehow weakened from Ukraine. The dogmatists are simply cos playing actual thought and analysis. Which I'm sure will enrage them to fight more leftists instead of listening to valid critique.\n\n\nDebt, to them, is a sign of weakness which is false because there is more to debt than a number. Which is why the US and China are 1 and 2 for national debt in the world but are far from the weakest counties that theres no contest. This article was written by someone who doesn't read much beyond popular news articles. Or more likely is TikTok educated.\u00a0\n\n\nI'd literally recommend just reading CNN or MSNBC to new leftists if this is what's coming out of Left Com.\u00a0",

Why do you speak without knowledge? What us is that to leftists like you and I? I can clearly see China has \"growth\" by the fact that it has within many decades since the revolution.\u00a0\n\n\nYou imply China's debt is bad for global capitalism. I don't see how that should be a concern for a leftists.\n\n\n>If you can't see that then yes, maybe stick to your CNN or MSNBC.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm a leftist correcting what I believe is incorrect analysis. That's my duty as a leftists as Mao has called out. You insult me like a liberal because capitalist social media algorithms are pushing you towards pithy remarks instead of trying to enlighten me and your fellow leftists on any mistakes in our analysis.\u00a0\n\n\nIf I am wrong show me so I can see where I have gone wrong",

It is undialectal to resist such an analysis in favor of repeating yesterday's critique which no longer functions as critique but is correctly regarded as the historical basis of the current situation. \n\nThe US has been ruled by capital from its inception, but this has taken different shapes throughout its history. Many of the forms which have characterized that rule since the end of the second world war, and some more fundamental ones dating back even to its founding, are now being aggressively dismantled by one section of that ruling class while the other appears helpless to stop them. Why is that happening and why now? Marxists, socialists, and communists should want to understand that development and not be satisfied with \"well, it's all just the ruling class\" hand waving.\n\nOnly through correct analysis of the current situation can we understand how to move within it. It will not do to merely pretend that nothing has changed *without first offering an analysis justifying that idea.* And bears pointing out that this is not an academic exercise. The stakes for leftists living in the US and territories targeted by the new fascism could not be higher.",

Remember, China does not want to stir imperialist conflicts if they can be avoided right now since its plans are all long-term and predicated on ongoing Chinese growth (with hopes of overtaking the US).",

What I'm asking for is not a simple thing. It demands a developed theoretical mind, but this is a moment to challenge ourselves because things are changing fast and \"the left,\" broadly conceived as ever, is in the crosshairs.

Do some reading of any revolutionary movements, their premises of revolution and why they happened to how the futures of their people would grow under socialism moving with the world. Read Marx, Engels, Lenin, Kim Il Sung, Mao, Ho Chi Minh, etc. See how they propose socialism with the changes in the world. If they are ultra-leftist and dogmatic, they will fail. The world does not work that way. It takes time to get people to see that their best interests are that of everyone's best interests in solidarity in socialism and finally making to communism.",
