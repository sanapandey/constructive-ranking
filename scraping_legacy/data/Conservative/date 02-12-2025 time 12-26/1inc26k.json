Where the memorandum refers to a body of water by name, it also refers to the specific bureau or law that designated it that name so that there's no ambiguity. The designation can change, but the body of water previously had that designation so it's still obviously the same body of water under a different name. That and it included a map, with the text clearly stating that the map is part of the memorandum.",
