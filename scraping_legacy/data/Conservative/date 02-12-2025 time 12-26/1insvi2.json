At that moment, they went from being the party of the organized labor, blue collar American worker and instead started down the path of identity politics.  NAFTA was rolled back by Trump in 2020 but by then the Democrats were too far gone to try to return to pretending to care about the interests of the American working class.  The rise of the internet ensured that Democrats' stranglehold on news reporting (and injecting healthy amounts of left leaning bias into it) was going to come to an eventual end.\n\nToday, they're the party of everyone who doesn't feel they're represented by the Republican Party.  That is, there is no Democrat Party anymore...just a weird conglomeration of every fringe oddball who doesn't fit in with mainstream America.  What has happened is that there is no more left versus right in this country.  It's now centrist versus extremist fringe.\n\nWhen you have what everyone defines as \"the left\" mimicking the words and actions of what that same everyone defines as the most far right example in our recent history (the actual Nazis) you see the truth of the present arrangement.  It's our self described leftists that are currently acting like and defending the actions of their modern Sturmabteilung (aka: Antifa), celebrating censorship, openly musing about putting people into re-education camps, running around publicly shouting \"death to the Jews\" while supporting a war with Russia on behalf of Ukraine which has actual, no shit, Nazi styled militia units in their army.  These are all the hallmarks of the historical fascist regimes...now fully embraced by those who like to call themselves leftists.  They also fully support Marxism, communism and state socialism so they're happy to grab all those left fringe attributes as well.\n\nThey are the party of the fringe, the outcast, the weirdo, the mentally unstable, the emotionally immature and the chronically irresponsible.  There is no Democrat Party anymore...there's just the anti-Republicans.\n\nWhat's more, the Republican Party has changed rather dramatically as well.  How else do you explain our current Republican president being a former Democrat as well as a big chunk of his cabinet?  We didn't so much entice Trump, Kennedy, Gabbard and the rest to come here...they were abandoned by their careening and out of control party and we were the calm center of sanity.  With the degradation of the left's mass indoctrination and propaganda efforts via mass media monopoly, more and more Americans came to conclude that the country wasn't so much R vs D but more like American vs anti-America.\n\nThat's where we stand today...and I expect that what we'll see is the Democrat party continue to fracture and devolve into irrelevancy to the point that they'll be a minor factor in how the country is run in the coming decade.  My real concern as an American is that we actually NEED the old Democrat party to act as an effective counterbalance to the tendencies of the Republicans.  As a lifelong registered Republican myself, I'm self-aware enough to discern the danger of the RINO and of having our currently leftist government bureaus swing too far to the other side and become just as bad in the opposite direction.  I expect, one day, we'll see the rise of a small part of what's currently Republicans but who are more like the old blue dog Democrats: more pro-labor, moderate socially and somewhat non-Christian (not anti-Christian...just not embracing the Bible for their every moral stance) to try and reclaim the old Democrat party's traditional stance.  But that day, I think, is a long way down the road from here.",
