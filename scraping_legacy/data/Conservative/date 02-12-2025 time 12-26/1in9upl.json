Judges stopped a lot of Bidens student loan plans, his plan to allow undocumented partners routes to citizenship, and various far reaching LGBT bills. \n\nIf you want the judicial removed that\u2019s fine. But if a far left candidate follows Trump then just think if you\u2019d still like them to immediately change deportation laws, to instantly forgive all student loans, to make far reaching changes to gov departments and policies without any congressional input. \n\nBecause once that precedent is set it will come back and bite you and is exactly why we have the separate branches to check each other. Radical orders will and should generate friction. \n\nAdditionally the fucking constitution itself states EOs cannot override laws. If the law says X must happen, you cannot change that as president alone as it should be.",

A district court in umpty-squat California is not one of those branches.\n\nAnd additionally... No the fucking constitution does not state EO cannot override laws because *the constitution doesn't say anything about EOs in the first place... Don't make shit up like a leftist does.*\n\nBut what the constitution does state in article VI, clause 2, the supremacy clause, is that laws operate in a hierarchy, with the constitution above all, federal below that, and state below that... *Which means constitutionally defined checks and balances between the three branches cannot be arbitrarily override by entities below them.*\n\nThis does cut both ways... And if a Democrat president wants to do something and it is constitutional he should not be prevented from doing it... And not should a Republican president be prevented from doing something is constitutionally permitted to do because some lower court judge has an over-inflated sense of his own self-importance and decided to step out of his lane.\n\nThe scotus rules on the constitutionality of what a president does... Lower courts do not.\n\nWe put an end to entities below the federal level thinking they had the power to dictate to the president what he could and could not do way back in the 1860s.\n\nAs for the precedent hand-wringing \"oh what will the left do if we do this!?  Oh heavens!\"... *Do not let fear of the other guy doing something wrong prevent you from having the courage to do what is right.*",

The operation and policymaking authority resides in the President\u2019s Article II powers.\n\nThe ability to freeze actions is routine, as is the ability to control what information is presented. Where is it required that the government must provide information about contraception and abortion?\n\nThese are not the same as Biden\u2019s executive orders like student loan forgiveness. Trump\u2019s decision to freeze payments for 90 days was standard. He wasn\u2019t violating Congress\u2014payments will resume if they complied with the law. In fact, most statutes give the President significant discretion to act.\n\nIn contrast, Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness plan openly contradicted the law and assumed powers that didn\u2019t exist. Even members of his own party disagreed with him.\n\nEquitable relief should be the hardest to obtain under our system. It comes from British common law, which distinguished between courts of law (representing the crown) and courts of equity (church courts). Legal relief is defined by the legislative body and typically involves monetary damages. Equitable relief, by contrast, is more flexible, based on fairness. That flexibility is precisely why courts should rarely grant it.\n\nEspecially concerning is the growing practice of district judges issuing national injunctions. Such a practice was almost unheard of before the 1980s and has become far more common since the Obama administration.\n\nFurthermore, most of these actions are temporary restraining orders (TROs), which are often issued ex parte or with limited briefing. TROs are stop-gap measures until the court can fully hear the case. They require a showing of specific and immediate harm\u2014why else are they most common in domestic violence cases? What specific and immediate harm exists here to justify a judge dictating what the government can display on its websites?\n\nFinally, this isn\u2019t a conflict between the courts and the executive branch\u2014it\u2019s a conflict between Congress and the President. Congress has the authority to direct specific policy, but in most of these cases, it hasn\u2019t done so. Instead, Congress has delegated general authority to the President, saying, \u201cHere\u2019s the rule\u2014make it work.\u201d Determining what information is made available and ensuring that funds are spent as directed fall squarely within the President\u2019s powers.",

It\u2019s not the specific content that\u2019s the issue legally, that\u2019s politics, it\u2019s that public research should be publicly available. Trump doesn\u2019t own that research, the population does. \n\nA TRO is justified because that data is frangible. It can be destroyed, deleted, corrupted. Trump is moving very fast and that understandably brings concern. What is happening to this data? What\u2019s the plan? How are they planning to stick to OSTP rules?\n\nTrump did this rapidly without the usual build up, public announcement of the plan, and then meeting the challenges and quashing them THEN doing the action. \n\nYes some of this is on abortion, some is on drugs, some is on what your farts are made of. It doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s all public research whether you agree with the outcome or not.\n\nReally this shouldn\u2019t be an EO, this is a really significant change to how public research could work and imo it should be challenged and a real plan worked out. Not just pulling the plug on data we as taxpayers have paid to get.",

It\u2019s not like Trump removed \u201call\u201d public health websites that the Judge restored, Trump just got rid of the DEI nonsense, such as:\n> CDC: Removed Information on contraception guidance, transgender HIV prevention, and school resources for LGBTQ students.\n> Bureau of Prisons: Renamed its \u201cInmate Gender\u201d page to \u201cInmate Sex\u201d and removed data on transgender inmates.\n\nNow all of it I agree needs to go, but would that mean we wouldn\u2019t know about transgender inmates? I agree, they shouldn\u2019t be in there especially with women, but we still need to know who they are.\n\nI will say the Judiciary Branch is necessary for a proper and responsible government, in order to have checks and balances in the federal government.\nHowever this doesn\u2019t mean everything a federal judge blocks means that it\u2019s a good thing.\nBut that\u2019s my take on it.",
