Not for pulling the strings to make sure that the Eagles (and only the Eagles) get to be champions.\n\nMy wife and I's favorite TV show is the Big Bang Theory and I hate that so many episodes have cameos from this bozo and the other prominent \"science guy\" douche. Neither of whom realize that the main character of the show is literally a caricature making fun of people exactly like them.",
