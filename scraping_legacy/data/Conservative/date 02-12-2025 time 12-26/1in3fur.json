    "selftext": "So I have seen at least five posts on Reddit in the past eight hours about how Trump was booed at the Super Bowl. I watched the Super Bowl live and he was definitely cheered. Then people are also saying that they edited in the cheers and that they need to sue Fox for doing that. This has to be the most unhinged I have ever seen Reddit. It\u2019s like they are full-blown conspiracy theorists. There was one post where they were corrected in the comments, but the vast majority of the posts are agreeing with the sentiment of the post and not correcting misinformation. ",

It's fake cheers!' \n\nI said it yesterday, reddit is literally support group fanfiction for left wingers who can't cope with reality.",

They are not living in reality. I was hoping the election would have made that clear for them, but instead it broke them and they've somehow gotten even crazier. Their commitment to being unhinged and simply wrong is both impressive and scary lol.",

I am often labelled as \"far-right, fascist, Nazi-sympathizer\" and all of the other names that follow before they even see that I don't agree with everything Trump has or will do. They think we all are hivemind bots that just think he is god and can do no wrong, and that none of us or at the very least, the overwhelming majority of us can't disagree with Trump.\n\nIt's their weird, wannabe dystopian fantasyland story that they really want to happen, for what reason, I don't know.

Why would there be any media coverage for that?
