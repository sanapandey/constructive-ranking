It\u2019s as if there\u2019s a new protest every week. . They\u2019re in for a long four years if they\u2019re going to be doing one every week. At this point, I don\u2019t think they even know what they\u2019re protesting for. But they have their right to freedom of protest and opinion. However, it will be entertaining for us. Looks like there\u2019s going to be a protest at state capitals every week.",

So cry me a river. Trump and Musk never could have accomplished what they did (all alone without institutional backing) if they didn't fight back like this.\n\nWe are done with allowing the left to abuse political correctness to increase their own power and protect their control of the institutions.
