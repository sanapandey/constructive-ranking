It's just not possible for schools to raise other people's kids and educate them at the same time.",

It\u2019s a combination of corrupt bureaucrats, woke indoctrinators, and overly powerful teacher unions. Each contributes a piece of the puzzle of why our schools are failing.\n\nAnd the fraud and wasteful spending is worst for public schools in lower income communities, because families in those communities have too much on their plate to properly police the schools, and hold them accountable.\n\nIn the good public schools, it\u2019s not money that makes the difference but parents. The parents will keep an eye on what their kids are learning, and complain when something isn\u2019t right. They go to school board meetings, put pressure to fire bad teachers, etc.\n\nAnd in private schools, there\u2019s an even more simple factor \u2014 the school is taking money directly from the parents, so that\u2019s who they will have to answer to if they waste it.",
