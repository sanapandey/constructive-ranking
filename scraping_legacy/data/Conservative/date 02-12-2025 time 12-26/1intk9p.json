Now the election rigging claims are getting out of control. People saying things like \u201coh I know I\u2019m not allowed to say anything, but now I have to speak up\u201d. Elon tampered with the voting machines! They overwhelmed swing states with ads! Gerrymandering! Are they just cribbing from Republicans claims in 2020!?!?",

Ive believed that for as long as ive been politically active. \n\nWhen trump won in '16 it was blatantly rigged for hillary, but they didnt acount for the massive trump grass roots movement. When he lost in '20 it was rigged as well thanks to c19 and the massive mail in voting fraud, they were able to do mass 3am vote dumps that were 90+% biden to steal trumps victory. I watched that election live and went to bed with trump habing won, only to awake and see those ballot dumps that took more votes for biden than there were available votes left. I believe they also stacked it in 24 against trump, but without that massive chunk of eaisly manipulated main in ballots, and a strong dose of believing their own propaganda, they again couldnt out cheat the turnout of the grass roots trump base.\n\nThere was always election fraud, and there will always be going forth untill we crack down on the commonly used routes like main in and electronic ballots. As well as interference and harvesting from election officials.",
