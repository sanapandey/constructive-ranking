Part of that law though is that DOE can\u2019t go backwards and set a regulation lower than it already has. So once DOE in Bidens administration raises a regulation from 75% efficient minimum to 85% efficient, DOE can never go back to 75%. \n\nEPCA itself would need to be overturned and replaced with something else. \n\nSource: in the industry",

I just can't think of a reason you'd want to other than owning the libs. Electricity isn't free and I don't want to be spending the money to blow 60 watts per light in my house when I could only be using 6. If I put incandescents in my array of can lights in my basement, you could probably watch the meter spin in real-time.\n\nOne thing that's nice about this for me though, is I have a few places where I'm using an incandescent light bulb as an ersatz heater (which is a fantastic use case for incandescents since they produce more heat than light) and I hopefully won't have to buy \"garage door opener\" bulbs (which got around the old regulations by being a \"specialty\" bulb) from the auto parts store anymore when I need to replace them.\n\nFor all the other appliances I agree that the old ones are usually better, except for stoves. Once I tried an induction stove, any desire to cook with gas was gone forever. But again, it's good for people to have the option.",

That just shouldn\u2019t be the case. Where I live, we have plenty of water, save the water conserving appliances for California.",
