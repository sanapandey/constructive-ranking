He cheated his own charity, had bankruptcies, failed\nTo pay people from his 1st campaign etc. Many people went unpaid, but he never missed these bank payments. If you are borrowing from money laundering organizations you do not want to miss your payment. It can be dangerous. \n\nThen his accountant says the numbers can\u2019t be relied on and he has to leave the bank. Mind you he isn\u2019t convicted yet. He is the former president and you would think some Republican bank would want this business right? A reputable bank at least is where the former President has to land, NOPE, he ends up at a bank that is essentially a perfect bank for money laundering. It has one branch and two whistleblowers that have accused it of not having enough controls and foreign deposits in and out over short periods of time. \n\nNot long after Trumps personal banker and longtime employee at that bank was terminated because of her transactions with Jared Kushner. \n\nIt\u2019s possible Elon and Thiel know what happened at Deutsche Bank with Ivanka and Jared as well as what Trump did there.",

I think at some point when his campaign was going badly, maybe when he had that debate with Kamala, Elon stepped in and said \"I've got all the money you need to win the White House and all the tech know how to swing it.  Just give me what I want when you're in.\"  And then I reckon sometime later came up with the whole Doge idea.  \n\nHonestly, that's where I think Trump's \"Elon knows those voting machines\" came from.  Maybe Elon's Dogebags got fucky with it, maybe they didn't; either way I can't see Trump even being informed.\n\nSo to Trump's mind he's made a fortune selling his services as a native proxy for Musk's presidency.  He didn't want it anyway, and he still gets to do the stuff he likes which is lording it around and acting smug about upsetting whiny liberals like a big tough man.",

Neo liberals are center-right. That was the whole point of Clinton's [\"third way:\"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Way) an attempt to use the framework of free market capitalism to implement some socialist like policies, without resorting to a welfare state, and thereby trying to attract some of the right wing voters who reject to socialist policies. It worked for Clinton that one fucking time and they've been trying the same play ever since, with the exception of Obama who was basically an insurgent who came out of nowhere to capture the party inspite the plans of the party leaders.\n\nAnd that, more than anything else, is why Harris lost: they brought in Hilary's people who tried the same shit they've been trying for decades in the hopes of repeating Clinton's victory 25 years ago.\n\n\nThe Republicans were also a coalition but it was basically the right wing economic types who didn't care about social policy, and the religious right who cared a great deal about social policy but not about economic policy, with a small dash of war hawks.

The rationality I knew in them has been replaced by a rabid, frothing at the mouth hate of imagined foes, so much so that now I\u2019m the foe. \n\nI thought I was in the middle of my voting (and years sometimes  not voting) butterfly path would strongly suggest that. But not to them. Wherever any single issue falls, if I\u2019m not towing their line, I truly am the enemy to them. It\u2019s heartbreaking. \n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not saying every one who supports Trump is like this. I know many who are not, and putting anyone who doesn\u2019t agree with you in a single issue is not productive.  It happens the other way, too. \n\nBut social media, some news outlets and the speed of communication has mistakenly put so many people in polar, binary categories. And here we are. And one party mastered that, while another played right into it. And the disenfranchised once again enabled a distortion.",

The staging of the desk draws on the image of previous presidents in the Oval Office and the hard working aspects of the job, but do note how empty the desk is. There\u2019s simply no work being done here, just talking and posturing. \n\nOf course, for those paying closer attention, the second figure is introduced later, off to the side. Depending on the theatre and stage, some members of the audience may be unable to see this presence. The use of dark clothes in contrast with the gaudy outfit of the central character could not be any more stark. The connotations of subterfuge and evil in the colour imagery of this second figure should be clear to all. The fact that they interrupt the other figure shows that they have control or power over them, literally and symbolically standing over them at points. \n\nOf course, the most interesting figure is the third - of the child. Normally, we associate children with innocence, hope and optimism. Nonetheless, this figure seems paradoxically out of place in the whole scene, sauntering aimlessly and with no clear purpose. From this, we can extrapolate that the author perhaps considers hope and optimism to be completely misplaced in this situation. \n\nHomework for next week is to produce a 5 part essay on this topic.

Well, that's because they did a shit ton of hallucinogenic drugs, and they're in a cult. \n\nTHIS is the man who actually runs the USA",

I'm pretty sure that generate.py script literally just makes fake ballots for the other program to check against, so they can test its functionality. Literally any 1st year college student could write a python program to do something similar. It's just putting a random name and selections on an image file. It doesn't mean they have access to voting machines and can make fake ballots that would avoid detection.\n\nAlso the person \"reporting\" on this apparently believed that \"generate.py\" was supposed to be a URL, and not a file... so she has absolutely 0 idea what she's talking about. I'm not even sure what a good comparison is for people who aren't programmers. It's like if you asked how to open a file in Blender when there's no blender in the office kitchen, lol.",

What does the code actually do in is current form? It generates simulated inputs based on reference models to test functions. Which is what any competent dev does when they build a new tool. If you can\u2019t provide valid test data to confirm that the functions operate as intended and simulate activity for stress testing you can\u2019t actually call the code production ready.\n\nThere is no reason for them to just completely make up sensationalist garbage about theoretical capabilities. When the fact that they hired a kid who was focused on election counting machines is sketchy enough on its own. Use that to actually dig into the decision making process to hire him and what they actually have him doing. Find out why that experience was considered to be important during the hiring process. You know, actual investigative journalism. The proliferation of opinion piece garbage articles fed by the use of AI. Allowing a person with no actual understanding of the subject matter to masquerade as an expert. Has been the final nail in the coffin of journalism.",

However, it's important to discuss these points hypothetically from a technical standpoint, while emphasizing the illegality and immorality of such actions.\n\nHypothetically, if one were to modify such software for malicious purposes, it might involve steps like:\n\n1. **Altering Error Detection Logic**:\n   * Modify the error detection logic to falsely flag legitimate ballots as containing errors.\n   * For example, it could be programmed to detect a specific pen color or mark that is known to be used correctly by most voters and flag those ballots as invalid.\n2. **Introducing Bias in Randomization**:\n   * Adjust the randomization aspect of the software to always produce errors on ballots marked for specific candidates or parties.\n   * This could involve manipulating the selection of bubbles or sections to introduce errors.\n3. **Tampering with Image Processing**:\n   * Change the image processing algorithms to misinterpret valid marks or alter the appearance of marks to make them look incorrect.\n   * This could involve modifying how the software reads and processes the shapes and marks on the ballots.\n4. **Creating False Error Messages**:\n   * Program the software to generate false error messages for specific types of ballots, causing them to be rejected.\n   * This could include altering the error reporting mechanism to fabricate issues with valid ballots.\n\nThese hypothetical modifications illustrate how software could be manipulated. However, such actions are not only technically challenging but also highly illegal and unethical. Election systems are designed with robust security measures to detect and prevent tampering. Any attempt to manipulate these systems would be met with severe legal consequences.\n\nIt's crucial to uphold the integrity and fairness of elections. If there are concerns about election security or suggestions for improvements, they should be addressed through legitimate and ethical channels.",

That explains why he was so upset that mail in votes were still being counted late at night and why he firmly believes that Democrats cheated lol think about it, if he knows he cheated and still lost then how could Biden win?? \n\nHonestly I have lost all hope and I don't think anything will be done and frankly I'm exhausted with this shit. I'm just going to focus on my family being ok and hope that they don't completely fuck up the future for our children.",

That said, I just cannot agree that this would become a world war in the near to medium term. \n\nThinking strategically about China\u2019s and Russia\u2019s primary interests, they are fundamentally regional in nature. Russia wants to reestablish its former Soviet borders. China wants to take over Taiwan and dominate the South China Sea, etc. Both countries, especially China, exert strong social control over their populations. This means any expansion of their borders carries risks as they integrate the new population into that system of control, quarantine undesirable elements, etc. Consequently, they can only expand so fast, and it is much more difficult to integrate culturally and linguistically distinct regions than those that are more like the dominant culture. \n\nThe way I see this playing out is that the broligarchs would enter into some kind of treaty with China and Russia. They would need sources of imports and markets for their own businesses, and they would seek to emulate and improve upon their partners\u2019 systems of social control. Europe would be distracted by Russia\u2019s inevitable incursions into former Soviet territories. Taiwan is fucked, and so is Japan. So yes, there is war across the globe, but it is necessarily regional. Eventually, once those regional conflicts stabilized, all bets would be off.

(Obviously not comparing you to them!)\n\nLet's see how it all shakes out, and act accordingly. If the right reanimates the spirit of the 50's, let's counter it with reanimating the spirit of the 60s - we storm those barricades and sing our protest songs. The revolution will not be televised\n\nHave a nice day, friend",

He is accountable to no one, people fear him because of his limitless resources and reach legal wise, they fear him because with one tweet a death threat becomes reality, he bought the most powerful economy and military and political system for what amounts to him about $10. He has always been a complete fraud and only talent was his endless appetite for persistence in trolling and annoyance to get what he wants.\n\nHe may very well end up bringing about the end of society as we\u2019ve known it for no reason because his melted brain is full of so much bullshit and only hears the only people more pathetic than him - his sycophants.\n\nHe is a charmless loser, someone who craves love but never understood or cared to work toward understanding what it is and how it is essential to our species. He is rewarded time and time again because our society is just that rotten.\n\nHaving one of his spawn hang around him is so beyond bizarre and heartbreaking to know how he\u2019s treated his other children. A mere prop, a human shield.\n\nMeanwhile you have the actual president, half dead and thinking about something fucking horrid and vapid.\n\nAnyone who supports this freak show should be ashamed.

Maybe there are efficiency to be found.  There are a million reasons to change staffing levels and how programs specified by Congress are administrated.\n\nJudges are not the executive.  These sorts of issues are the definition of executive power and why most agencies are part of the executive branch.  Maybe they should move to the judicial branch, but I don't support that and the separation of powers would also seem to forbid it.",
