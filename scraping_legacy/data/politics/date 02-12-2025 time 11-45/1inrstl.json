Trump will cash out his 60% stake for $10-12 billion, and finally be a real billionaire (will a full pardon for everything he's done the last decade).",

It's not a feeling I can accurately describe, but the fact it's *gold* and so prominent seemed like the kind of open statement you'd see from a royal statesman during the (largely Imperial) era of history. Which harkens back all the way to the Bible describing the golden sash as the \"sign of a divine being\" and authority:\n\n>In this passage, the Apostle John describes a vision of Jesus Christ in His glorified state. The golden sash around His chest signifies His royal and priestly authority. The imagery of the golden sash emphasizes the divine nature and the exalted status of Christ as the eternal High Priest and King.\n\nAbout Revelation 1:13.\n\nIt also harkens back to golden chains and golden ornaments *often* being used in figures of spiritual or military authority, especially for royalty. I know it's The Crown, but [this](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5897942717bffc479b6d245b/1574357078046-ISNNJ6KZTACXYIXB7DCV/matt+smith+military+dress.jpg).\n\nI'm probably reading too much into, but given Musk's...uh...*throwing his heart out* habits, the kid behaving like he owned the place, and *golden sashes* not being something the usual kid would want to wear, it's creeping me the fuck out. If this was just a sesame street t-shirt, fuck the dress code for a three year old. But what three year old wakes up in the morning and goes: \"Papa! I want to wear my *golden sash* to the White House?!\"\n\nIt was just so fucking weird, it *immediately* drew my eye to it and caused the Ick.",

But if they really want to do it, then there's nothing the people can do.\n\nWhat's terrible about this is I can already see all the defenses of this line of reasoning. \"He's smart, he'll police himself fine\", \"If the people tell him he's wrong, I'm sure he'll listen\", \"He's triggering the libs, so I support it\", and so on. They see no problem with an unelected billionaire having final say over the federal budget because, for now, he's only cutting things they don't like, don't care about, or don't even know exist.\n\nNot enough people care about this circumventing of the system of government this country was founded on because either they support what's being done or don't care because it hasn't directly impacted them yet. We are slipping into a dictatorship, but it sounds alarmist to say because we haven't yet gotten to the really bad parts that people associate with dictatorships, when it's too late to do anything.\n\nElon Musk is effectively our shadow president, and not enough people care in any way that matters because it hasn't affected their day to day lives yet.
