Kinship also overrides workplace relationships, in the sense that Musk is \"in charge\" of his own son - so the child's presence is a living monument and reminder of the limits of Trump's authority.",

To an extent, it's the bystander effect. The larger the crowd, the less of a response because everyone assumes that someone else will take the responsibility and risk so nobody does anything.\n\nWhat I find harder to sympathize with are obviously the fascistic right wing voters and people who didn't do their civic responsibility and vote at all. It's also deeply frustrating that even as a concentration camp is being built at Gitmo, a lot of liberals (not leftists, liberals) still have such faith in the word of law. They say that it'll all be fine and over in four years, as if millions of lives weren't getting shattered and that it's crystal fucking clear that Project 2025 is happening and that they're not giving up power again.\n\nPeople need to admit that if they don't organize and fight this, that it will only get further entrenched until like in the 1940s, other countries have to step in and bomb the fascists to hell with untold amounts of death and destruction. If you're not up for a fight fine then, flee or something, but stop telling people to calm down and to stop being alarmist while deliberately keeping your head in the sand.",

My guess is the 3 branches of government would say \"deal with it, he's been sworn in.\"\n\n\nTrump and his people likely know this, so another possibility is that his dementia is getting to a point where they're Feinsteining him for appearances and to appease MAGA that their king is still around, but Elon is the one calling the shots. Vance would be a similar puppet if trump had a medical issue that they couldn't hide anymore.\u00a0\n\n\nThe sad thing is that even if the election was rigged, it should not have been anywhere near close enough to be rigged.
