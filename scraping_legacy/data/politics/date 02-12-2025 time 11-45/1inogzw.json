The looming shutdown would be a good opportunity to *try* and gain some backbone. \n\nEven saw the local equivalent here. SocDems were down to ~14% in polls, after being a doormat for conservatives in a coalition government. They switched through party leadership, tried PR campagins - nothing helped. \n\nUntil they actually stood up for social democratic policy and values. Loudly telling their coalition \"partner\" to fuck off. No more coalition, no matter what. And it worked well enough to cancel out conservatives at the next coalition. \n\nI so badly wish the Democrats would try for once. Nobody even expects them to succeed. But *try*. \n\nThe World badly needs U.S. fascism to be fought in house.",

If Democrats have to be the sane ones, they get held to the sane standard, but Republicans can literally wallow in shit and have the media sell it as savvy, or tactical, or appealing to everyday workers of America, or soft pedaled through euphemistic, equivocating bullshit.\n\nAm I saying that no Republican ever faces bad press? Certainly not. Am I saying Trump never faces bad press? Certainly not. But there is a massive asymmetry there, and it's all the more tilted when it's about Trump specifically. \"Liberal\" media will do things like call Marjorie Taylor Greene a \"firebrand,\" for example. To someone politically unplugged, just passing by that headline, firebrand sounds cool and absolutely misses the point and severity of what is happening.",

They're rolling over and confirming the insane picks of trump's cabinet, with some members actually voting -for- these whackos. They're afraid of the optics of being a rebel, and rebels are EXACTLY what we need right now. \n\nThrowing minorities under the bus doesn't help win anything, it only weakens the democrats position and makes it that much easier for republicans to attack the next marginalized group they set their sights on. We need to get rid of the old, complacent, moneyed 'leadership' and get some young firebrands in office. People who get angry instead of clutching their pearls. \n\nBlaming minorities for this is just doing the republicans work for them, and I'm getting sick of seeing people taking this approach.",

            "body": "\u201cYarvin gave a talk about \u201crebooting\u201d the American government at the 2012 BIL Conference. He used it to advocate the acronym \u201cRAGE\u201d, which he defined as \u201cRetire All Government Employees\u201d. He described what he felt were flaws in the accepted \u201cWorld War II mythology\u201d, alluding to the idea that Hitler\u2019s invasions were acts of self-defense. He argued these discrepancies were pushed by America\u2019s \u201cruling communists\u201d, who invented political correctness as an \u201cextremely elaborate mechanism for persecuting racists and fascists\u201d. \u201cIf Americans want to change their government,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019re going to have to get over their dictator phobia.\u201d\n\n\u201cYarvin has influenced some prominent Silicon Valley investors and Republican politicians, with venture capitalist Peter Thiel described as his \u201cmost important connection\u201d. Political strategist Steve Bannon has read and admired his work. Vice President JD Vance has cited Yarvin as an influence. The Director of Policy Planning during Trump\u2019s second presidency, Michael Anton, has also discussed Yarvin\u2019s ideas. In January 2025, Yarvin attended a Trump inaugural gala in Washington; Politico reported he was \u201can informal guest of honor\u201d due to his \u201coutsize influence over the Trumpian right.\u201d",
