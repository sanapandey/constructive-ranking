Support for legalizing Marijuana is well over 70% in Kansas but it'll never get a vote because of the extreme right wing in charge and holding it back from ever being approved amongst other things like Medicaid expansion. \n\nKansas while not a liberal state has always been decently progressive when you got down to its actual citizens and actual issues. Sadly many of them vote completely against those things when it matters.",
