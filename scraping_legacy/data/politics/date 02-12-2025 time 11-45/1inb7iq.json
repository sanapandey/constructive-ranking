They're basically like if someone made a fan fiction and then people just started believing it as true, meaning some of them blatantly ignore the spirit or message of a lot of the bible.\n\nI've kind of been connecting 2 and 2 together and it really does kind of feel like the slide into fascism was kind of easy for a lot of people because they were already used to accepting a bunch of totally inconsistent nonsense as true at the request of a figurehead. It just shifted from their pastors to Trump",

Not just some national in-group. That\u2019s how it started out. \n\nAnd pretty much every Christian sect wants to claim to have an interpretation that\u2019s most true to the original Christianity. So none of them have any business totally discarding concern for the poor or the alien just because it\u2019s politically convenient.\n\nActual adherence to the religion in that case  would require the discipline of solving immigration issues humanely, hard as it would be, not cramming people into concentration camps.",

That's kinda literally the entire point of Protestsntism.\n\n\nAnyone can cite as many historic examples as they want to when regardless Catholicism was the name for any church that followed Jesus and the quibble was only about who was really Pope because believers of Jesus follow the Pope (and a few dissesents, \"a pope\"), but after Martin Luther's rejection of the Pope that's become the literal definition of a Protestant - and there are many many many kinds but fundamentally they exist only because of Martin Luther and rejection of the Pope - of course they'd never ever define themselves by virtue of not being Catholic, but when you look at them in historical context that's all they all. And the Catholics are Catholic by virtue of accepting the Pope, and predate any and all extant Protestants, no matter how much they're in denial of that. \n\n\nYou cannot think Buddha (or all of the Buddhas) was full of shit and still be a Buddhist. You can be Buddhist-ish at best. You cannot reject Muhammad and be Muslim (oh lordy lord, help the person who tries if they say anything) even if you follow all the rules. And you cannot be a real Catholic and reject the Pope. The difference between a Catholic and a Protestant is literally the acceptance of the Pope. Just like the difference between Jews and Christians is the acceptance of Jesus (I mean there's infinitely more because Judaism and Christianity share literally almost zero of anything except appropriation of text). \n\n\n\nCertainly anyone can call themselves whatever they want - it doesn't make it factual. I can call myself a meerkat.... but upon closer inspection you'll see I sadly lack the necessary criteria to be a meerkat. But I can fucking call myself one if I want. Doesn't make me a goddam meerkat though. Same for Catholics. \n\n**EDIT** *me words badling. Make gooder? No knoe.*",

By my religion, Catholics are and have always been idol worshippers, praying at literal idols of Jesus on the cross (yes, that's an idol. Maybe you never stopped and thought about it, but it's the literal definition of an idol and that's indesputable). Oh and the saints too. Don't get me wrong - it's stunning art and I've got to hand it to the Catholics that when it comes to religious architecture there is absolutely no religion which can even try to compare. Stunning. \n\n\nMinor quibbles over idol worship in Catholicism is meaningless to me because Catholics have always been idol worshippers and Christians as a whole polytheists. So yes, I'm absolutely ignorant of what you reference and I'm totally willing to admit that. \n\n\nActually in full sincerity I'm super interested to hear more about that. I don't want to fight - I admit I'm ignorant of what you're talking about and genuinely and without sarcasm very interested to hear more if you're willing to indulge me - not as any trap, I truly am curious. \n\n\nBut again, what is a catholic who rejects the Pope? A Protestant. You may not like what the Pope has to say, but the point is the Pope is ordained to speak for Jesus on earth, and that changes with the times (if Catholicism is TRULY a LIVING religion and God is not dead) and if the voice of Jesus himself says things you do not like.... well you can find excuses, point to faults... but to be a Catholic is to accept he's Jesus's emissary on earth in the footsteps of Paul himself. \n\n\n\nYou can reject the Pope's words - that's absolutely fine and acceptable. In fact most Christians do - but they're called Protestants. There's no shame in becoming one. \n\n\n\nBut understand this: you cannot find reasons to reject the Pope and still be Catholic, no matter how good you think the reasons are or how many agree with you. And that's totally ok! You can reject the Pope, that's absolutely your right! \n\n\n\nBut it means you're not a Catholic. YOU - NO ONE - is empowered above Jesus to say the Pope is false just because he does or says things you don't like. **Accept that.** How *dare* you - YOU - presume to judge Jesus's literal representative on earth. The hubris. \n\n\nYou can be Catholic and with Jesus and Paul's word on earth, or you can be Protestant. They're both absolutely acceptable options, but you cannot be a protestant catholic. It's not a real spiritual option. Read the doctrine for being a catholic. And do as you please! There's no wrong answers for what church you are. \n\n\nExcept for being a \"catholic\" who rejects the pope. They already made that movement long ago, and it's called Protestant. You're a protestant. And that's ok my friend! You can still do the Catholic things you like, just recognize that regardless of anything else, if you reject the Pope as Jesus's voice and leadership on earth, you're a Protestant. Period full stop. \n\n\nAnd it's ok. What's in a name? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. Right? \n\n\nYou don't have to believe in this Pope. But you can't have your cake and eat it too my friend. But honestly, truly, it's ok.",

On average, american catholics pay roughly 1,2% of their yearly income to the church.\n\nAmerican catholic parishes are and have constantly been shut down or merged for the past few decades due to decreasing number of parishioners/churchgoers. When the church has such a low attendance that it can no longer support itself from donations, then they either close it down or merge the parishes  and transfer the churchgoers to a larger more stable parish.\n\nThe catholic parishes do not pay anything directly to the Vatican. Catholic parishes pay \"cathedraticum\" to their archdiocese (bishop) on a sliding scale from 5% to 25% per year. The archdioceses send a small portion of the collected money to the Vatican, which is called \"Peter's pence\".\n\nPeter's pence is used by the Vatican to support charitable and philanthropic works across the world, some of it is used to pay for Vatican's administrative costs.\n\nMajority of the money collected by parishes is kept local, and majority of the money sent to archdioceses is also kept local, in order to support the structure of the church.\n\nP.s.
