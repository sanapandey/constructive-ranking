I remember finding out one day that you could no longer tab through text inputs, because in trying to update a line of code, they crippled the whole feature, and it would hard crash the whole program.\n\nThey'd fix that, but end up using some variable that something else used, so then the charge system flatlined.

It was a nightmare of 2000s bad practices - at least I thought it was 2000s, but they had just built a form-based scheduling app in 2012. It was *all* spaghetti code; you'd search one function name in the project folder and it would appear 150 times because they copy/pasted the same function names everywhere. Some pages that had multiple uses had a code for which version of the page to process under. But also some modules had their own functions file, scoped to only that folder and it's sub-folders.\n\nI remember the tech support department wanted me to add a field in a box. Found the page, but then spent half of the day tracking down which copy of the function page with GetCustInfo() was actually being called when they ran GetCustInfo(), because the one in one section called one stored procedure and the other called a different one. So once I figured out which one, I had to track down the sp (also a bunch of duplicate names here) to find the right module it was part of, to find the actual query, *just to see if the value was even returned by the cursor*.\n\nThere was no way that system was maintainable long term. There was an entirely separate second system that I never got around to upgrading, but that one was just as incomprehensible because it was written by the same guys at the same time.\n\nApparently that's what happens when you make network engineers write front-ends.",

Whenever asked, every project took a day.\n\nThat quickly caught the ear of the CEO because the rest of us would be like \"nah, that's gonna take 2 weeks\", and the CEO would be like \"well he must be super smart if he says it'll take a day\".\n\nSpoiler: it would never take a day, he'd work on it for 3 weeks then abandon it, and we'd eventually have to reassign it to someone else.\n\n*Anyway*, at approximately the same time the rest of us had been passing around videos from 'Pitch Meeting' on YouTube, and one of the lines regularly said in those videos whenever there's a gaping plot hole is \"super easy, barely an inconvenience\". So internally we stared calling the kid 'SEBAI'.",

Would need to be tested. When we factor in these additional costs, we could run our current software for another 8-9 years, including maintenance and support, before even reaching a break-even point for a new, supposedly cheaper solution. This does not take into account the need to retrain people, the likely loss of productivity at the beginning of the transition, and other additional issues that the AI answer omitted. \n\nI really hate this trend where management thinks they understand how AI works and what to use it for, when they very clearly don\u2019t.",

If you dig in to how Social Security and related programs work, you realize that yeah thats pretty expected. 1 person may be receiving multiple sets of benefits through completely legitimate means. Multiple people can have the same social security number and each be receiving benefits, this was common back in the days when women didnt work they would share their husbands ssn. Some of those women are still alive and receiving benefits. There are a bunch of little edge cases like that that would see 1 ssn repeated multiple times. \n\nSocial Security is really complicated so I get not understanding how something like this can happen. However the correct option if youre a government official looking in to it would be to go to the social security admin and ask one of the people whos been dealing with that system for decades why that is the case. Unfortunately, Elons an arrogant moron who hired a bunch of children who wont tell him no so hes just going to assume he knows better and most likely going to break shit and lead to people suffering.",

I see comments guessing where the Elon's query errors arose, but they are assuming reasonably current architecture. \n\nThe last I worked near this stuff was almost 20 years ago, but at that time it was all still on very old systems and the structure was primitive.

This same shit is why most financial and tax systems are also running on old as dirt systems. You have to build a system that holds not just all the current information but all that historical data and all those historical rules and calculations for things. Itd be a hell of a project and even more hellish youd have to convince the politicians why you needed the significant amount of resources needed to update it when the current system \"works just fine\"",

Point still stands, there is a reason the duplicates exist.\u00a0",

It wasn\u2019t that they were stupid either.\n\nEvery single one was a business major. Every. Single. One.\n\nLike, they were *angered* by simple explanations to how the government spends and the impact that has on county and city governments and how tax dollars are actually spent and appropriations made. Not because it upset a previous expectation or because they were flatly wrong about what they believed. They were angry because they couldn\u2019t understand that governments don\u2019t directly spend tax dollars and the money was spent before taxes collected. They couldn\u2019t grasp that, along with other basic concepts like the government spending money on things that generated no profit or lost money. They couldn\u2019t grasp the benefit of a highway system that didn\u2019t cost anything to drive on and why that may be a net benefit to the tax payer and businesses. Nor could they grasp how the highway was paid for.\n\nGranted, this is anecdotal, and the students were almost all freshmen and sophomores, but it really seemed like a percentage of people cannot grasp these sorts of concepts.\n\nTrump and Musk are doing exactly what I\u2019d expect those students to do.",

In the case of the one that's just barely out of high school and the ones still in college, they're not even junior developers. Those ones are more proto-juniors of some sort than anything else.\n\nSome of the reporting on these guys quotes people who know at least some of them and describes them as \"brilliant.\" They very well may be, but it's not about brilliance. Lots of junior developers are brilliant but still massive mistakes. It's part of growing as a developer. You're going to make mistakes, and hopefully processes and the seniors around you will catch them before they cause problems and teach you what you did wrong and why.\n\nOnly these guys aren't operating with any visible guardrails. They exist outside the departments they're interacting with, and they're ideologically driven. They've got carte blanche, and they see themselves as on a mission to save America.\n\nAnyone standing in their way is the deep state. If some random senior developer tries to stop them from doing something stupid, is it because they're worried about what might happen or is it because that person is trying to thwart their mission? Hell, do they even have the experience to understand that the person pushing back is trying to *help* them so they don't screw things up?\n\nA bunch of entitled junior developers with an ideological fervor and backed up by people willing to fire you--or even threaten you with criminal prosecution--should you get in their way as they play with mission critical systems is freaking *terrifying*.\n\nIt's also going to turn them into some pretty shitty developers. You don't get to learn in a situation like that. They're going to be toxic when they come out the other side, and that assumes Musk and Trump don't throw them under the bus and light them on fire the moment they fuck up Social Security payments.",

So much of what propelled Elon's status was the way he talked about what Tesla, and later SpaceX, would do in the future and not about what it was doing now. The smoke and mirrors were obvious to anybody that looked at it with clear eyes, but a lot of people were swept up in the near romantic way Musk spoke about the companies and their \"missions\".",

I'll state I have no idea what the schema for their databases is, but let's say you have a table called \"payments\" which shows all the payouts for social security, and another table called \"social security numbers\" that keep track of people that are being paid out to. Those tables are linked via something called keys, where a column of data from a is on table b to link them.\n\nIf you wrote a query to list out payments and told it to connect the \"social security numbers\" table- it would list multiple records, one for each payment. It would also \"show\" multiple repeated social security numbers, since one person has probably gotten multiple social security payments.\n\nThis is an extreme simplification of a possible situation, but one explanation how someone who might be less skilled with writing queries may think there's fraud.",

Some of them are interconnected, some of them are independent, but in order for the data to be useful, there has to be something that links two given databases together.  Maybe it's a special \"key\" column, or a unique ID number.\n\nSometimes, though, the data in one table can be scattered over several different rows.  Maybe the ID \"jnikkir\\_id\\_001\" is repeated in a few different rows, but each row has different data.  Your birthday is in one row, but it's not in another, but that *other* row has your home address.\n\nYou use \"queries\" to ask the database for information.  \"Give me every row that has FAVORITE\\_COLOR equal to BLUE\" is one.  \"Give me every row that has the ID 'jnikkir\\_id\\_001'\" is another.\n\nBy collecting all of the rows that have \"jnikkir\\_id\\_001\" as the unique ID, you get both your birthday **and** address.\n\nNow, you *could* go through and collect all of that information together and put it into one row, but that can destroy information like \"when was this row last updated\" or \"when was this row first created\".  When you're talking about something like a Social Security Number - a system that has exist for a long time across many different platforms and tracking systems - you want to keep as much data as possible.  I don't know how these systems are set up, but not de-duplicating a table is a viable strategy, and I've been in situations where de-duplicating a table is the wrong move to take.",

A huge sequential file spread across several CDs. We bought a CD jukebox to mount the CDs and I was tasked with writing a b-tree search across the mess.\n\nWe found duplicate SSNs. The first popped up when a **male** was in a treatment center for women. Turns out the file contained **other fields** to be used in addition to the SSN when the SSA needed to store data about someone without an SSN but could tie them to somebody who did have a SSN. (A child, or foreign relatives)\n\nSo the simple btree became find, check prior records to find first, then return a list of all matching SSNs and make resolving the issue a UI problem.",

Just because you only know about the evil billionaires doesn't mean that there aren't tons that are just like that kind man and his wife that just wanted the generations after them to succeed. And if you're curious as to why he only sent women to school, that would be because he had 3 sons and no daughters. He was one of the kindest and smartest men I ever had the privilege of getting to know in my life and I'm honored that he saw in me what I could not see in myself at the time. Him seeing value in me led me to see value in myself.",

Surely we as a people value completeness and attention to detail as much as we value time well spent, and reading is a virtue unto itself, is it not?  Well, is it?  I don't know, and who truly can, in the end?  Which is why completeness must prevail entirely in the face of such monumental uncertainty.  For you.  For me.  For us.  For everyone.  Including you and me, of course, just to be sure we're clear and no one gets accidentally or erroneously left out of this particular equation we've been discussing just now (but only using \"equation\" in a metaphorical sense, of course, while the rest is intended substantially more literally, if you understand me).\n\n\n\\* And at this, also, some may quibble about meanings and whether a maximal expression is truly achievable within a framework of short and shorter attention spans or whether expression of some ideas is truly expression at all.  Take, for example, an expression such as the following expression: iamafishiamafishiamafishiamafishiamafishiamafishiamafishiamafishiamafishiamafishiamafishiamafishiamafishiamafishiamafishiamafishiamafishiamafishiamafishiamafish.  Whether this expression is a true expression of expression can't truly be divined by an outside observer, yet has a message nevertheless been conveyed?  Some would say yes.  Others may say no.  But yet others still would say that other others can be wrong, or almost certainly mistaken, at least at times.  But can they all be correct?  Some say yes, while others again say no or maybe in a recursive position extending to the end of time.  Or does it truly extend that far?  Some say yes.  Others, though, would maintain a certain, specific degree of what could be defined as quibbles, if one were so inclined.  But now we've wandered into the weeds and morass of perpetual unaccountability, or perhaps a more finite unaccountability depending on one's opinion of the potential heat death of the universe.  Though does the universe ending actually make one accountable, or simply cement that unaccountability for all time (or lack of time)?  Therein lies the rub, but we likely should return ourselves to the original discussion lest it get away from us in earnest and spiral out of control to a point where we can no longer contain it or even entertain the notion of it eventually being entertained in some possible future we have yet to foresee, being of course, creatures of inherently limited perception as defined by our own limited perception, which may yet be revealed for the tautological nightmare that it very much appears, at least in the opinion of many experts (albeit of similarly seemingly limited perception) to be.",

No, I'm not hoping other people go and hate him, I am pointing out the hypocrisy that exists between him and his supporters, which means he's not a genuine representation of them or their interests and that they're being used and manipulated.\n\nLet me spell it out for you: if someone needs to *lie* about who they are or their actions, they are attempting to mislead others *for their gain*, often at the expense of those who they are lying to. Simple, basic, power dynamics that have existed for thousands and thousands of years between human beings.\n\nBut I guess that 10,000 years of knowledge won't stop you. I genuinely feel like my dogs can tell when someone is lying better than some people can. But they're also better trained than some people too and have actual patience and don't have emotional regulation issues.",

One simple example like the above was given in one thing I read. Others have mentioned that different programs one qualifies for could be understood as duplicates depending on how the dataset DOGE kids are looking at is built too. \n\nGiven their love of AI, I don't doubt they're just throwing all the data into an LLM and saying \"find unresolved duplicates here\" as some sort of very basic understanding of \"fraud\". Since receiving benefits multiple times for one SSN, for \"social security\" is obviously fraud, on it's face - if you don't understand anything in depth.

As a consultant, I worked with over 50 different companies ranging from 50 people small companies to giant multinationals, including over a dozen state agencies. The amount of gross incompetence I've seen is staggering, and it's not just at the tiny companies.\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, where 3 is the expected norm, there was a single 5: a large multinational bank. There were a few 4s, including, oddly enough, the Texas DOJ. Of The remaining companies, maybe a quarter were over 3, but most were between 1.5 and 2.5, where 1 is being largely reactionary with ad hoc and undocumented processes, and 2 is still reactionary, but at least you have documented processes that are repeatable and largely followed",

But more than half of what was original allocated to the IRS over 10 years has been cut out. so hopefully that will help some, but given that would be an obvious answer i would expect Musk will find many things in the IRS that need to be cut so that the only audits they'll be soon will be for EITC again.)",

I find this hard to believe given your grammar. \n\nSCOTUS ruled on ideological lines that Trump has immunity for some of his conduct as president but not unofficial acts. The court did not determine what constitutes an \u201cofficial\u201d act in this case, leaving that to the lower court. The key implication is such broad immunity (not defining what is \u201cofficial\u201d) gives the President enormous latitude. \n\nYour interpretation relies on the assumption the courts play fair. However, as we\u2019ve seen with the Supreme Court, judges can be bought and sold. Kicking the decision back to the lower courts just ensures the issue is tied up in the judicial branch until it gets back to SCOTUS, which\u2014with its corrupt judges\u2014will grant Trump immunity. \n\nSotomayor writes that the majority opinion invents, \u201can atextual, ahistorical, and unjustifiable immunity that puts the President above the law,\u201d in her dissent. \n\nShe references \u201cthree moves\u201d from the decision that \u201ccompletely insulate Presidents from criminal liability.\u201d These are: \n\n1) Absolute immunity for the president\u2019s exercise of \u201ccore constitutional powers.\u201d\n\n2) Creates expansive immunity for all \u201cofficial acts.\u201d\n\n3) Declares that evidence concerning acts for which the President is immune can play no role in any criminal prosecution against him.\n\nAs a result she concludes in her dissent, \u201cEven if these nightmare scenarios never play out, and I pray they never do, the damage has been done. The relationship between the President and the people he serves has shifted irrevocably. In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law.\u201d\n\nWhile I agree there are different ways to interpret the decision, I doubt you truly understand it if you claim my take (and Sotomayor\u2019s) is a misinterpretation.\n\nEdit: wording",

There are two things that we should be doing all the time right now, and they\u2019re by far the most important things.**\n\nYou should NOT be bothering with online petitions or emailing.\n\n1) The best thing you can do to be heard and get your congressperson to pay attention is to have **face-to-face time** \u2014 if they have town halls, go to them.\n\nGo to their local offices.\n\nIf you\u2019re in DC, try to find a way to go to an event of theirs. Go to the \u201cmobile offices\u201d that their staff hold periodically (all these times are located on each congressperson\u2019s website).\n\nWhen you go, ask questions. A lot of them. And push for answers. The louder and more vocal and present you can be at those the better.\n\n\n2) But those in-person events don\u2019t happen every day. **So, the absolute most important thing that people should be doing every day is calling.**\nYOU SHOULD MAKE 6 CALLS A DAY: \n2 each (DC office and your local office)\nto your 2 Senators &\nyour 1 Representative.\n\nThe staffer was very clear that any sort of online contact basically gets immediately ignored, and letters pretty much get thrown in the trash (unless you have a particularly strong emotional story \u2014 but even then it\u2019s not worth the time it took you to craft that letter).\n\n**Calls are what all the congresspeople pay attention to.**\n\nEvery single day, the Senior Staff and the Senator get a report of the 3 most-called-about topics for that day at each of their offices (in DC and local offices), and exactly how many people said what about each of those topics.\n\nThey\u2019re also sorted by zip code and area code.\n\nShe said that Republican callers generally outnumber Democrat callers 4-1, and when it\u2019s a particular issue that single-issue-voters pay attention to (like gun control, or planned parenthood funding, etc...), it\u2019s often closer to 11-1, and that\u2019s recently pushed Republican congressmen on the fence to vote with the Republicans. **In the last 8 years, Republicans have called, and Democrats haven\u2019t.**\n\n\n**So, when you call:**\n\n\tA) When calling the DC office, ask for the Staff member in charge of whatever you\u2019re calling about (\u201cHi, I\u2019d like to speak with the staffer in charge of Healthcare, please\u201d)\n- local offices won\u2019t always have specific ones, but they might. If you get transferred to that person, awesome. If you don\u2019t, that\u2019s ok\n- ask for that person\u2019s name, and then just keep talking to whoever answered the phone.\n\nDon\u2019t leave a message (unless the office doesn\u2019t pick up at all \u2014 then you can \u2014 but it\u2019s better to talk to the staffer who first answered than leave a message for the specific staffer in charge of your topic).\n\n\t\ud83d\ude0e B) Give them your zip code. They won\u2019t always ask for it, but make sure you give it to them, so they can mark it down. Extra points if you live in a zip code that traditionally votes for them, since they\u2019ll want to make sure they get/keep your vote.\n\n\tC) If you can make it personal, make it personal. \u201cI voted for you in the last election and I\u2019m worried/happy/whatever\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m a teacher, and I am appalled by Betsy DeVos,\u201d or \u201cas a single mother\u201d or \u201cas a white, middle class woman,\u201d or whatever.\n\n\tD) Pick 1-2 specific things per day to focus on. Don\u2019t rattle off everything you\u2019re concerned about \u2014 they\u2019re figuring out what 1-2 topics to mark you down for on their lists. So, focus on 1-2 per day. Ideally something that will be voted on/taken up in the next few days, but it doesn\u2019t really matter \u2014 even if there\u2019s not a vote coming up in the next week, call anyway. It\u2019s important that they just keep getting calls.\n\n\tE) Be clear on what you want \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that the Senator...\u201d or \u201cI want to thank the Senator for their vote on... \u201c or \u201cI want the Senator to know that voting in _____ way is the wrong decision for our state because... \u201c Don\u2019t leave any ambiguity.\n\n     F) They may get to know your voice/get sick of you \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter. The people answering the phones generally turn over every 6 weeks anyway, so even if they\u2019re really sick of you, they\u2019ll be gone in 6 weeks.\n\n\nFrom experience since the election: If you hate being on the phone & feel awkward (which is a lot of people) don\u2019t worry about it \u2014 there are a bunch of scripts (Indivisible has some, there are lots of others floating around these days). After a few days of calling, it starts to feel a lot more natural.\n\nPut the 6 numbers in your phone (all under P \u2013 Politician.) An example is Politician McCaskill MO, Politician McCaskill DC, Politician Blunt MO, etc.\n\nThis makes it easy to go down the list every day.\n\n**Bottom line: CALLS WORK. SHOW UP. KEEP CALLING.**",

In the book *War and Peace* by Leo Tolstoy, there\u2019s a part where Emperor Napoleon is on the move and some fanboys freak out and needlessly BUT *happily* drown themselves trying to get his attention. \nThey could have gone down the river a few minutes and not died but they chose the deepest and most treacherous part of the river instead. Because the Emperor might watch them. \n\nNapoleon\u2019s response? \ud83d\ude34 (he didn\u2019t watch them)\n\nHere\u2019s the excerpt for anyone interested (a few lines have been abridged): \n\n> Napoleon looked up and down the river, dismounted, and sat down on a log that lay on the bank. At a mute sign from him, a telescope was handed him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to him, and he gazed at the opposite bank. \n\n> The order [to Napoleon\u2019s soldiers] was to find a ford and to cross the river. The colonel of the Polish Uhlans, a handsome old man, flushed and, fumbling in his speech from excitement, asked the aide-de-camp whether he would be permitted to swim the river with his Uhlans instead of seeking a ford. \n\n> In evident fear of refusal, like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse, **he begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the Emperor\u2019s eyes.** The aide-de-camp replied that probably the Emperor would not be displeased at this excess of zeal.\n\n> As soon as the aide-de-camp had said this, the old mustached officer, with happy face and sparkling eyes, raised his saber, shouted\n\u201cVivat!\u201d and, commanding the Uhlans to follow him, spurred his horse and galloped into the river.\n\n> He gave an angry thrust to his horse, which had grown restive under him, and plunged into the water, heading for the deepest part where the current was swift. \n\n> Hundreds of Uhlans galloped in after him. It was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the stream, and the Uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their horses. \n\n> Some of the horses were drowned and some of the men; the others tried to swim on, some in the saddle and some clinging to their horses\u2019 manes.\n\n> **They tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and, though there was a ford one third of a mile away, were proud that they were swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who sat on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing.**\n\n>**For [Napoleon] it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of the world** [\u2026] **was enough to dumfound people and impel them to insane self-oblivion.** He called for his horse and rode to his quarters.\n\n> Some forty Uhlans were drowned in the river, though boats were sent to their assistance. The majority struggled back to the bank from which they had started. The colonel and some of his men got across and with difficulty clambered out on the further bank. **And as soon as they had got out, in their soaked and streaming clothes, they shouted \u201cVivat!\u201d and looked ecstatically at the spot where Napoleon had been but where he no longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy.**",

Those forms were designed to reduce paper use, resulting in lists of entry codes - AA to pay money for a certain month, or maybe an RFD code X to manually *not* pay that money, DE SiC code to force the system to use a specified amount as the \u201cpaid\u201d part of its automated calculations\u2026. These interfaces were designed for people with a stack of folders on their desks, who, between cigarettes, walked over to a terminal to wait in line to put in a punch card.  there is so much shit to learn in training, and so many ways to screw up a record, that most technicians never reach real competence, even after several years. All entries give feedback *the next day* because it\u2019s an overnight batch process, and if there is an issue you just get a three-numeral exception code that may or may not help you fix whatever it was\u2026.\n\nThe payment centers have been chasing a 90% accuracy (exception rate 10% lol) for literally decades with no meaningful improvement. It\u2019s a disgracefully antiquated system long overdue for a complete replacement.\n\nThat said, incompetence and error does not mean fraud. If Congress and the President wanted to fund a replacement that works, that would be great.

                                    "body": "The way a traditional pension works is that the pension is a pooled fund of the *employer's* money, which is vested for the employee at some rate over time and is *obligated* to be paid on some kind of pre-agreed basis at retirement. That generally includes any interest earned from the invested fund, *but* if the investment does poorly, the employee is *still owed* whatever the agreed upon amount was. This puts the risk and the financial liability on the employer. \n\nSo... how does that incentivize the employer, exactly? Well, if an employee leaves, *they are still owed whatever portion of the money that has been accrued thus far*, and it's 100% the employers money, so an employer with a high turnover rate is basically just pissing away money that they are obligated to pay. And it's usually *quite a bit of money* because it's based on a dollar amount that would be projected to be a functional monthly income upon that person's retirement in decades. And again, they are obligated to pay it, so it's risky  for them to not set aside enough up front. It's not based on the success of the investments, it's guaranteed money with the likelihood of being *more* as a result of good investment/healthy market. This makes it kind of a long term investment in the employee themself. The employer is saying \"I am willing to set aside a retirement-amount of money for you on a regular basis, for as long as you work here.\" Thus, it is in their best interest to actually keep that employee around and get the career-amount of work they have already started paying for. They want to avoid high turnover as much as possible. An employee who lives a comfortable life, has a decent work life, and a guaranteed retirement just isn't as likely to want or need to leave. The employer is less likely to play headcount shell games with accounting because they still owe those people money.\n\nA 401k or IRA is the *employee's* money. Yes, many decent employers offer some amount of matching, but that is a paltry amount in comparison to a fairly standard pension contribution, it's not obligated, *and* its directly based off the employees current income -- making it reliant on the success of that investment portfolio to actually *become* a retirement-amount of money. *All* of the financial risk sits with the employee and they aren't *owed* anything. There is no *guarantee* of anything upon retirement. If those investments do poorly or the markets crash, you get screwed and that's your entire lifetime of contributions. Thus, the employer is *less* concerned with keeping that person around, so they have less incentive to consistently offer competitive pay, good working environments, work life balance, etc. Employees are fully at risk, so it's in their best interest to earn as much as possible as quickly as possible, to invest as early as they can and have the best chance of successfully accruing enough growth to retire by their targeted retirement age. Yes, there is some flexibility there, but it's basically just the flexibility of holding all the risk, so also making all the decisions about how to handle your risk. And as it turns out, it's better to move around every few years, fishing for more money, than it is to continue working at a place that won't pay you competitively anymore. The other party involved has minimal skin in the game, they are liable for nothing, so they don't really need to give as much of a fuck. \n\nLast thing I can think of - a pension isn't mutually exclusive of a 401k. You can still have a 401k or any other investment portfolios that you contribute to on your own. The pension is guaranteed money that you don't contribute to *in addition* to whatever you can do for yourself *and* social security (if it still exists in the future).\n\nAnyway, hopefully that helps show why pensions are pretty much non-existent in the private sector these days, lol.",

Don't get me wrong, I think its hugely beneficial to the average people, but it really is a lot of extra risk/liability on the business attached to one of their largest expenses -- labor.  It's better for the business's stability and bottom line to not offer a pension. Realistically, the majority times it does happen is when it's collectively bargained for or legislated. If it got legislated that all major businesses needed to offer a pension, it would cause who knows what kind of economic ripple effects and probably drive a lot of businesses to move even more of their workforce out of the country if possible.",

There is no magical world where the 1/3 remaining votes all go toward the candidate that you want them to vote for. They would likely split there votes with the same ratio as the 2/3rds who did vote.*\n\nThat being said, I am a firm believer that the vote counting machines were compromised based on the data that I have seen.

If I make it to the actual retirement age, I would have outlived all the males in my ancestry. \n\nHowever, I know many people growing up that if there was not social security, they would have been homeless. People don't realize there are reasons why younger \"Healthy Appearing\" people end up on SSI. There are many reasons a younger person is not working. However, all I hear growing up from others is those people should get a job without a single care on why they are disabled.\n\nPeople act like getting on SSI disability is a cakewalk, when 90% of all first time applicants to SSI disability get denied as a way of shutting out hope from them trying to reapply again. Does not matter if your form has the proper authorities signing off on it whether they think you can or cannot work with that disability. \n\nSo for Elon to even suggest there are people that somehow are listed with getting multiple benefits, he is talking out his ass, as I assume the first order of business from the SS administration is to check to see if you already getting the benefits as some people applying are that mentally unwell they may have forgot they applied and are getting benefits already. \n\nBut some MAGA people I think are also very familiar with signing up for SSI benefits, since they are the ones that use it the most. Then again, this is MAGA we are talking about, the same ones that forget every 4 fucking years in order to vote, you have to show ID and believe Trump and crew claiming illegals are coming in and without any proof they are in the correct polling place are casting votes for democrats.",

Whether that's not-harassing (gently calling and urging...) whoever your rep/sen are to literally do *anything* instead of saying \"Uh, hey, what do you want??\" Or organizing with locals to prevent fascist ICE squads from hauling off your neighbors, friends, etc. Maybe attend some local meetings and just ask \"Hey, so, if there's a major event that happens. How can we assure people aren't starving, going without water, etc.?\" I don't think most communities have much plan in that regard. For emergencies that last a week or so, sure. What happens if there are major cut offs of electricity for months or years. Or agriculture steeply falls off and there's a legitimate shortage of food for the first time in the US in a LONG time (distribution and purposeful destruction of food is the only reason people starve now. That could change though.) Even for those who live deep red areas these are universal things.

But the specific link is here, per the Enyclopedia Britannica:\n\n>The most common gematria translation of 666 is the Hebrew term *neron qesar* (possibly transliterated as *nron qsr*, or in Hebrew, \u05e0\u05e8\u05d5\u05df \u05e7\u05e1\u05e8) or \u201cNeron Caesar\u201d in English. Some suggest that the name corresponds to Roman emperor [Nero](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nero-Roman-emperor), who ruled the [Roman Empire](https://www.britannica.com/place/Roman-Empire) from 54 to 68 ce. Many find the case for reading Nero as the numerically indicated beast compelling in light of that emperor\u2019s [notorious](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/notorious) persecution of Christians.",

Don't forget that it was mostly because Republicans refused to work for the people, refused to settle or walk the line, made up lies and stunted real growth to push their narratives, and Democrats refused to take a stand for us as well when we needed them the most. They're now complicit in what is happening. We voted for these people and we can still make a stand to vote them out.\n\nWe have to remind the government it works for us, not these sleezy billionaires in all their pockets. They still need us functioning for their companies, AI isn't replacing anyone properly yet, and people are learning that slowly at the least.",

The only places big enough to carve that out from are the military budget, social security, and Medicare/medicaid. \n\nNow they\u2019re going to lie about these programs and steal them for their tax cuts-",

Part of this plan is to eliminate the entire welfare state and pass permanent tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\nThey also intend to do all the same things with state governments, and that work will happen side by side wherever possible (but with blue states, it will take more time; expect blue states to be \u201cpunished\u201d with federal policies that undermine their Democratic leadership and trick voters into believing that Democrats are the cause of their states\u2019 troubles, as they\u2019ve done with the release of the water in California, which will hurt the state\u2014and Governor Newsom\u2014this summer).\n\nMake no mistake about it; Peter Thiel is anti-democracy and sees dictatorship as the path forward. He doesn\u2019t pretend otherwise, either. Read the man\u2019s own words and take him seriously. He believes he is \u201cfixing\u201d our country and that the only way to do that is with a strong dictator who doesn\u2019t have to answer to anyone and can simply \u201cget things done.\u201d (Which famous dictator from the 20th century does he sound like?)\n\nThe problem is that most people have no idea who Peter Thiel is. He prefers to hide in the shadows and have men like Musk carry out the plans.",

Other than the tax breaks they want for themselves, it\u2019s important to also remember Musk\u2019s pre-election warnings about \u201ctough times ahead.\u201d He and his oligarch buddies know the economy will take a massive hit; he said this twice in the weeks leading up to the election (verbally and posted on Twitter).\n\nHe calls it a \u201creset\u201d of the economy.\n\nWhy would anyone *want* to do things to harm the economy? Because it creates a fire sale for the wealthy. They intend to buy up all the distressed companies and their assets, further consolidating the wealth among themselves.\n\nSo, it\u2019s tax breaks, a corporate fire sale, and ultimately control of the government to ensure they are always in power. Everything they do is meant to further these goals. Dictatorship, Thiel will explain, is the only way to do it. He can\u2019t have the American people or their elected officials undermining him or his friends. He expects Trump to also ignore the courts and to appoint SCOTUS justices who will rubber stamp everything he wants.\n\nThis takes Unitary Executive Theory (popularized by Dick Cheney) to a level even Dick Cheney didn\u2019t call for. Cheney was upset that Nixon was driven from office and that Congress asserted its authority in the aftermath of Nixon\u2019s departure, so he advocated for a stronger Executive branch, but Thiel is calling for straight-up dictatorship masquerading as democracy.",

There are two things that we should be doing all the time right now, and they\u2019re by far the most important things.**\n\nYou should NOT be bothering with online petitions or emailing.\n\n1) The best thing you can do to be heard and get your congressperson to pay attention is to have **face-to-face time** \u2014 if they have town halls, go to them.\n\nGo to their local offices.\n\nIf you\u2019re in DC, try to find a way to go to an event of theirs. Go to the \u201cmobile offices\u201d that their staff hold periodically (all these times are located on each congressperson\u2019s website).\n\nWhen you go, ask questions. A lot of them. And push for answers. The louder and more vocal and present you can be at those the better.\n\n\n2) But those in-person events don\u2019t happen every day. **So, the absolute most important thing that people should be doing every day is calling.**\nYOU SHOULD MAKE 6 CALLS A DAY: \n2 each (DC office and your local office)\nto your 2 Senators &\nyour 1 Representative.\n\nThe staffer was very clear that any sort of online contact basically gets immediately ignored, and letters pretty much get thrown in the trash (unless you have a particularly strong emotional story \u2014 but even then it\u2019s not worth the time it took you to craft that letter).\n\n**Calls are what all the congresspeople pay attention to.**\n\nEvery single day, the Senior Staff and the Senator get a report of the 3 most-called-about topics for that day at each of their offices (in DC and local offices), and exactly how many people said what about each of those topics.\n\nThey\u2019re also sorted by zip code and area code.\n\nShe said that Republican callers generally outnumber Democrat callers 4-1, and when it\u2019s a particular issue that single-issue-voters pay attention to (like gun control, or planned parenthood funding, etc...), it\u2019s often closer to 11-1, and that\u2019s recently pushed Republican congressmen on the fence to vote with the Republicans. **In the last 8 years, Republicans have called, and Democrats haven\u2019t.**\n\n\n**So, when you call:**\n\n\tA) When calling the DC office, ask for the Staff member in charge of whatever you\u2019re calling about (\u201cHi, I\u2019d like to speak with the staffer in charge of Healthcare, please\u201d)\n- local offices won\u2019t always have specific ones, but they might. If you get transferred to that person, awesome. If you don\u2019t, that\u2019s ok\n- ask for that person\u2019s name, and then just keep talking to whoever answered the phone.\n\nDon\u2019t leave a message (unless the office doesn\u2019t pick up at all \u2014 then you can \u2014 but it\u2019s better to talk to the staffer who first answered than leave a message for the specific staffer in charge of your topic).\n\n\t\ud83d\ude0e B) Give them your zip code. They won\u2019t always ask for it, but make sure you give it to them, so they can mark it down. Extra points if you live in a zip code that traditionally votes for them, since they\u2019ll want to make sure they get/keep your vote.\n\n\tC) If you can make it personal, make it personal. \u201cI voted for you in the last election and I\u2019m worried/happy/whatever\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m a teacher, and I am appalled by Betsy DeVos,\u201d or \u201cas a single mother\u201d or \u201cas a white, middle class woman,\u201d or whatever.\n\n\tD) Pick 1-2 specific things per day to focus on. Don\u2019t rattle off everything you\u2019re concerned about \u2014 they\u2019re figuring out what 1-2 topics to mark you down for on their lists. So, focus on 1-2 per day. Ideally something that will be voted on/taken up in the next few days, but it doesn\u2019t really matter \u2014 even if there\u2019s not a vote coming up in the next week, call anyway. It\u2019s important that they just keep getting calls.\n\n\tE) Be clear on what you want \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that the Senator...\u201d or \u201cI want to thank the Senator for their vote on... \u201c or \u201cI want the Senator to know that voting in _____ way is the wrong decision for our state because... \u201c Don\u2019t leave any ambiguity.\n\n     F) They may get to know your voice/get sick of you \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter. The people answering the phones generally turn over every 6 weeks anyway, so even if they\u2019re really sick of you, they\u2019ll be gone in 6 weeks.\n\n\nFrom experience since the election: If you hate being on the phone & feel awkward (which is a lot of people) don\u2019t worry about it \u2014 there are a bunch of scripts (Indivisible has some, there are lots of others floating around these days). After a few days of calling, it starts to feel a lot more natural.\n\nPut the 6 numbers in your phone (all under P \u2013 Politician.) An example is Politician McCaskill MO, Politician McCaskill DC, Politician Blunt MO, etc.\n\nThis makes it easy to go down the list every day.\n\n**Bottom line: CALLS WORK. SHOW UP. KEEP CALLING.**",

He's a walking embodiment of false authority syndrome, speaking to a Dunning-Kruger syndrome fanbase.\n\nThere are a ton of reasons why the SSN is a unique key. For instance, if a woman changes her last name when she gets married, the record should still be maintained so that looking her up by either name produces the correct SSN, and looking up her SSN will show all of her aliases. Using the SSN as a primary key would prevent this. I could go on but I'm certain there are subreddits where his idiotic statement is being taken apart with great force.\n\nI do agree with you 100% that his motives are ultimately insidious, and they will not hesitate to use treasury payments as an active weapon against blue states.",

There is so much duplication of effort, all costing $$$.  They forced my adult child to reduce SSI and then draw upon my SS retirement.  Child is permanently, profoundly, cognitively, and physically disabled.  Since birth.  Functions on the level of an infant.  Can't speak, read, or write.   No way child could ever work doing any \"job\".  Lifelong medical documentation.  It took months of calls and SSA mailing out paperwork first increasing, then decreasing benefits for either program.  Think 6 months.  They're going to give 2 months of full amount for both types of funding, then on month 3 they're going to reduce SSI to this much, then letters about how much will get from \"retirement\" on my retirement funds, then multiple letters outlining when each payment will be deposited.  Oh, and let's not forget that child only gets to keep $20 of the \"retirement\" funding over what the normal SSI payment should be.  So much wasted manpower and mailing costs.  Just one small example I've experienced over child's benefits.  \n\nNow, I'm sitting here with a day-long appointment waiting for Federal Medicaid Rep to pop in for a visit to verify child is a real person and not a fraud.  After 20 years of having state Medicaid program \"monitors\" visiting the home either monthly or now quarterly.  Not just one person.  Multiple branches of state Medicaid program.  There is so much duplication of effort and expenses because it is so poorly administered.  All of this \"supervision and monitoring\" and yet child can't get acute physical therapy through the MCO because they have no clue what they are supposed to do, timelines within which to do those things, and the list goes on, ad nauseam.  Almost 3 months now of waiting and getting a different story each contact with them.  But it's the recipients that are committing fraud and waste.  \n\nPerhaps take a look at, and revise, the outdated policies and procedures.   Potential there to reduce unnecessary jobs (duplication of effort) and save $$$ by streamlining processes and ensuring that personnel are trained and know their jobs.  Be a little more transparent so that people know what is supposed to happen and why.\n\nMaybe this will be lost on a lot of people not in these programs, but we are living in a real-world nightmare with how poorly these agencies are operated.  While I agree that there are people taking advantage of benefits (there are always people in all walks of life that take advantage of things), the majority are legitimately in need.   Have a little heart while you revamp the systems.  This scorched-earth, suddenly de-fund everything behavior is really not necessary, is it?   The systems didn't get this way in a week or two, and it seems like it will take some time to investigate where issues exist and then develop and implement remedies.  \n\nI suppose it is just easier to stop the funding and close things down rather than make the effort it will take to fix systems broken for decades.",

Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. Lack of Supporting Data\n\nThere is no publicly available government report or credible independent analysis that confirms $100 billion in entitlement spending goes to individuals without an SSN. If such a massive discrepancy existed, it would likely be a major political and media issue.\n\n2. What Counts as \u201cEntitlements\u201d?\n\t\u2022\tIf Musk is referring to Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid, these programs have strict identity and eligibility requirements, including an SSN or legal status verification.\n\t\u2022\tSome programs like emergency Medicaid, public health assistance, or disaster relief do provide aid to undocumented immigrants, but the total amount spent on such services is far below $100 billion.\n\n3. The SSN Requirement for Benefits\n\nAs noted in the Social Security Administration\u2019s official policy, an SSN is required for most federal benefits. While there are some exceptions, such as emergency medical care or benefits provided at the state level (like some food assistance programs), these typically do not add up to the scale Musk is implying.\n\n4. Misrepresentation of \u201cNo SSN\u201d Cases\n\nThere are legitimate reasons why some individuals might receive benefits without an SSN, such as:\n\t\u2022\tChildren born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents (who are U.S. citizens by birth).\n\t\u2022\tRefugees and asylum seekers who are in the process of obtaining legal status.\n\t\u2022\tCertain disaster or emergency relief programs that don\u2019t require an SSN for immediate aid.\n\n5. Political Rhetoric and Fearmongering\n\nMusk has a history of making provocative political statements, often in ways that align with populist concerns about government spending and immigration. By framing his claim as \u201c$100 billion\u201d in entitlements to those without any form of ID, he is likely exaggerating real but much smaller issues to stir debate or push a political narrative.\n\nConclusion\n\nMusk\u2019s statement lacks concrete evidence, misrepresents how entitlement programs work, and plays into common misconceptions about undocumented immigrants and government benefits. While there are some cases where individuals without SSNs receive aid, they do not account for anywhere near $100 billion annually.\n\nIt\u2019s a classic case of taking a grain of truth and stretching it into something much bigger and more alarming. There are some benefits that undocumented immigrants or people without SSNs can receive, but the idea that it adds up to $100 billion per year is wildly exaggerated.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of claim that sounds shocking but falls apart once you look at actual government spending and eligibility rules. Musk knows how to get engagement, and this kind of statement stirs up exactly the kind of online reaction he thrives on.",

There is no extra money coming into social security from other taxes and what not. As well that money is your money but here is the problem. The government can borrow on that money and then they have to pay it back in full within x amount of months or something (I am not sure on the timeframe but they have to pay it back). So when people talk about getting rid of social security they are really just talking about making it so the government doesn't have to pay back the money they borrowed from you, the working American.\n\nHere is another thing, Social Security is the third rail of politics. Any time some politician goes after social security with real gusto, you know what happens? They don't get re-elected. I know Musk is not elected but the people who can reign him in are. If they don't want to continue social security it is your right as an American to demand that money back in full, plus interest. I am not joking it is your money and you are entitled to it. As long as you have been putting money into it it is your money to access after a certain time and if that time is up then they might as well give it back so we can all afford bread during the muskcession that is coming.",

Turns out it was for Gaza in Mozambique\u2026\n\nSo whether he misinterprets because he\u2019s incompetent or if it\u2019s with malicious intent, the end result is the same - nothing messaged from his team should be accepted as true. The impacts of this within his private companies was annoying but now this is happening within the federal government it\u2019s an unacceptable risk to the American people. Just 1 of 100 reasons he needs to be removed from the equation.",

Instead they\u2019ll likely: say something along the lines of there is rampant fraud not being caught in SS system (basically what Musk\u2019s quoted saying in this article). They will implement some form of stopping payments to millions and making them jump thru hoops to ensure they are in fact eligible to receive. What this will do? Allow them to TARGET specific groups (likely with AI help) of people while not touching large groups of SS recipients (their base). Why it will work? Their base will love the idea of minorities needing to go thru extra hoops to prove their eligibility and many getting denied even after doing so. \n\nAnd then simultaneously they\u2019ll work to end the \u201cSS tax\u201d so that the money will run out in 10 years or whatever. Why this will work? They\u2019ll be able to blame the president in 2034 or whatever for not finding a solution. \n\nThis will be done in an evil way that their base rallies behind, despite what many in this thread think, which is that it will be universally unpopular and people will get what they voted for. I have my doubts that will actually happen and instead it will target specific groups now and future generations later while his base will largely continue collecting their checks as usual today.",

First.. the biggest problem with Musk or ANYONE on one side of the political fence in there is biased control of things. This should be both dems and repubs in there side by side, and Congress frankly, scrutinizing everything. NOT a civilian who has a LOT to gain by eliminating programs that currently help millions. \n\nThat said.. I do NOT think (so far) that Musk is saying \"the money we pay in SS to people (like my own mom who lives on it with no other way to survive at almost 80 years old in low income housing) is too much and we need to cut that\".  What I think he is saying is there is a lot of money outside of that paid to SS retirees and medicare/medical that is way too much. For example, there could very well be claims for medical/medicare by doctors, hospitals, etc that are well in excess of what they should be.. and are paid. We all know that hospitals/etc charge insane amounts of money for little things, like needles, bed sheets, etc. SO.. if somehow Musk is NOT going out of his way to screw people over and really is cleaning things up, I'd be all to happy to see that Hospitals can't charge $800 for bed sheets, and $50 per needle that costs 10c to make. SOMEHOW though.. I just dont think that is what is going on. So without ANY transparency, just HIS word.. it's really REALLY hard to trust what he is saying. The dude is a compulsive liar, and like Trump has to put himself on a pedestal to survive. \n\nI am still trying to understand how the fuck the judges that said he can not be in there.. and he is STILL in there? Why the fuck has nobody removed him? A court order said to stop. Where is our fucking military that upholds the constitution and law?",

The rest is opinions from individuals commenting on the matter: \n\n\"Musk wrote on X on February 11: \"At this point, I am 100% certain that the magnitude of the fraud in federal entitlements (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Welfare, Disability, etc) exceeds the combined sum of every private scam you've ever heard by FAR. It's not even close.\"\n\n\"It follows another post from February 8 in which Musk said he was told there are currently over $100 billion per year of entitlements payments to individuals with no Social Security Number or \"even a temporary ID number.\"\n\nAccording to the official Social Security Administration website: \"You need an SSN [Social Security number] to work, collect Social Security benefits, and receive certain government services.\"\n\n\"If accurate, this is extremely suspicious,\" Musk said, as he explained several steps agreed between DOGE and the Treasury Department for making future payments, including the use of \"a rationale for the payment in the comment field\" and categorization codes.\n\nHe continued: \"When I asked if anyone at Treasury had a rough guess for what percentage of that number is unequivocal and obvious fraud, the consensus in the room was about half, so $50B/year or $1B/week!! This is utterly insane and must be addressed immediately.\"\n\nMusk also said in a separate post that \"the social security database is not de-duplicated, meaning you can have the same SSN [Social Security number] many times over, which further enables MASSIVE FRAUD!!\"\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the SSA for comment, but it was after hours and hasn't received comment back. \n\nSo to be clear, the article is not stating that social security will be taken away or the SSA will be dismantled. DOGE will work with the treasury department and SSA to check into fraudulent uses of the system. The warning that was issued (as the title presents) was not a warning about the discontinuance of SS but of the potential fraud that is being investigated by the three departments listed above. \n\n*No personal opinion was presented in this comment. Just wanting to provide an unbiased description of the article after seeing comments of incorrect assumptions and accusations being made.\n\nSource for non partisan fact checking of Newsweek: \nhttps://mediabiasfactcheck.com/newsweek/",

Do you honestly believe that? \n\nAlso, many people on here who are skilled IT or database management professionals have commented that what Musk posted makes no sense. There's no such term as \"de-duplicated\" and it's entirely possible that the same SS# would appear multiple times if you run a simple script, such as in the case of multiple monthly payments.\n\nBasically, there's no way to determine that there's \"massive fraud\" in just the few hours that Musk and his Traitor Tots have been there.\n\nIf you have any experience with the SSA, you also know that it's extremely difficult to get any sort of SSDI or other payment fraudulently. I know someone who is truly disabled and hasn't been able to work for decades, and he's been denied SSDI multiple times. I know it's anecdotal, but I really don't think it's that easy to defraud the SSA.",

This wasn\u2019t some random, untested drug; it had been studied for years and had shown promise against SARS-related viruses. Thousands of doctors around the world reported success using it to treat COVID-19 patients. Yet, the medical establishmentbacked by government orders vilified HCQ, ran fraudulent studies to discredit it, and even restricted access to it. Why? Because under Emergency Use Authorization laws, the vaccines could only be authorized if no other effective treatments existed.\n\nThe result? Patients who could have been treated were denied care. Doctors who spoke out lost their jobs and licenses. And a one-size-fits-all vaccine mandate was pushed on the public without any room for debate. If the truth was so solidly on their side, why was there such a desperate need to silence any opposition?

The CDC had to issue warnings about it not having been properly tested because it was going viral on facebook as a \u201cmiracle cure\u201d which is not fucking helpful during a pandemic for a lot of reasons. Social media companies (barely) voluntarily chose not to promote it because it\u2019s fucking dangerous to do so. \n\nLater, it was tested for its efficacy on covid but guess what - it was completely ineffective, at best.

If you don't have a social, you either need to get one, or if you don't legally have an SSN, you're not eligible for social security anyway.\n\nHe's not coming for your grandma's money.. Unless she died 10 years ago overseas or something and someone else is illegally claiming the money on her behalf etc. I think there's lots of scams and fraud like this going on? But normal people who worked and have an SSN legally won't be affected. It'd be extremely stupid to piss off such a large portion of your citizens by taking something that's rightfully theirs. If he did this, it'd be French Revolution time for him IMO..",

We know for example that insurance fraud is a thing, so is he right that this kind of funding is being exploited for fraudulent uses? Is it as prevalent as he claims?\n\n3.

If an ex-spouse is eligible to receive a 50% SSA check based on her ex-spouse\u2019s earnings, his SSN and wage record will need be cross-referenced to her\u2019s to verify who makes her eligible to receive a spousal check. \n\nIf a recipient is eligible for SSA disability, the minor children are eligible for a minor child SSA disability check and the disabled worker\u2019s SSN has to be cross-referenced to each minor child. So the primary SSA recipient could have numerous people eligible to receive a SSA check under their SSN and wage records .\nThat cross-reference SSN field will have duplicate SSNs because others are receiving a check based on one person and the program needs to know whose wage records make them eligible to receive a check.\n\nIt\u2019s similar to the military sponsor and their dependents.

But one thing that absolutely needs to happen when people are criticizing this administration is to end the hyperbole and the exaggeration of what's going on. I say this because it's hurting any attempts that we could possibly have with pushing back. That article is so biased that I can't trust any of it. DOGE is not a \"non-official\" department. It's acting in an advisory capacity, which the president absolutely has authority to set up. Musk doesn't get to make decisions independently, Doge is doing what it's doing, under the delegated authority of the president of the United States, and reporting back to President Trump who is then making the decision of what should be done. From my understanding this is completely legal, I'm not claiming to be an expert here but I worked in the government for over a decade and this is how I understand authority to work. If there are any constitutional scholars that have proof that this is wrong, I am open to learning about that. And when I say proof I don't mean some news article that says he can't do it and that's it, that is not proof. That is just somebody else's opinion.\n\nEven if there are questions about its legality the approach news outlets, and most Democrats online, are utilizing is having the absolute opposite effect of what is intended. It is not convincing anybody on the fence or on the right that they are wrong. You are attacking them, which just entrenches them into their beliefs even more. Look at Trump's approval ratings, look at the Democrats approval ratings. I don't know when the last time they were so far apart but as we continue on this path that Gap just seems to be growing. You can like it or not, agree with it or not, but it is the reality of what is going on right now.\n\nAdditionally, if you read the article, and not just the headline and make assumptions, the stated goal is to end any sort of fraud or abuse within the social security system. How can anybody be against that in principle? I understand the argument, and I don't disagree, that how Trump is utilizing Doge has a lot of downside potential and that neither one of them are really trustworthy but what does that give you? Conjecture, speculation, and fear-mongering is not proof. This is applicable to pretty much everything Doge is doing right now. The idea of ending fraud, waste and abuse within the government is an absolutely fantastic idea and something that should be done regularly. We all know that the government wastes money, we all know that the Pentagon can't even pass an audit and account for trillions of dollars. It's becoming blatantly obvious that both sides of the aisle have been laundering money through organizations like usaid and defrauding the US people to enrich themselves. Nobody should be okay with this. This is the corruption within the system, but everybody is so focused on left versus right that they're ignoring the issues of the system.\n\nI'm not saying you have to accept or support Trump and Elon in doing this but I'm saying the concept in general is a good one, and yes I have concerns too about the way they are doing it and the potential ramifications of how quickly they're doing it. That being said if the Democrats ever want to have any hope of bringing the Independence and moderates back into the Democrat party. They have got to stop doing this. I don't like or support any party right now. Neither of them have shown that they are worthy of my vote and I have almost zero hope that the Republican party will ever get there. But the Democrats could if they would stop this ridiculousness, hold themselves to an actual standard, stop spreading conjecture and assumptions, find proof of wrongdoing, or maybe start putting up viable candidates and start winning more elections. These are all things well within the power of the democratic party that would result in gaining support. The reality is the Democrats don't want to do that because they want us as a people at each other's throats about an invisible made-up left versus right paradigm in which there are only two political parties and we are locked into a system of voting of what side the coin needs to face up. \n\nAt this point I feel the only solution is that we the people need to stop reelecting these people. From the ground up, POTUS is not the only thing we vote for. We need to hold our elected officials accountable for their actions and vote them out when they do not act in our best interests regardless of what political party they're a part of. Until we can do that, we are going to just keep flip-flopping and neither side is really better than the other. They are just both horrible in different ways.",
