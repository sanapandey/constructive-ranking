Just wanted whatever payout he was offered by russian oligarchs. Maybe there was dirt on him too - whatever these pedo pee tapes are about. But in the years since 2016 and the war in Ukaraine, Trumps seen how weak Putin and Russia really are and has turned the tables that if the blackmail material is released then the US will declare war on Russia, maybe even just by proxy and Russia will be destroyed. Russia has probably also seen that Trump is crazy enough to do anything and the American people are basically powerless to stop it. So releasing these pee or pedo tapes may just straight uo achieve nothing except accelerate Trumps need to turn the US into a dictatorship - which ultimately, since Trump is unhinged, its in Russias interests to not have Trump as president because he's unreliable and unpredictable.\n\nBut idk im just a guy",

The emperor, eager to have such a marvelous outfit, commissions them to make him a suit.\n\nThe swindlers pretend to weave the fabric, though they are actually producing nothing. Ministers and officials, not wanting to appear unworthy or foolish, pretend to see the fabric and praise its beauty. When the emperor finally \"dons\" the nonexistent clothes, he proudly parades through the city.\n\nThe townspeople, afraid of seeming unfit or stupid, also pretend to admire his outfit\u2014until a small child innocently exclaims, \"But he isn't wearing anything at all!\" The crowd then realizes the truth, but the emperor, too proud to admit his mistake, continues his procession as if nothing is wrong.\n\nThe story is a satire on pride, self-deception, and social conformity. The GOP congress members are like the emperor's ministers and advisors who are afraid to admit that they've seen nothing, so they report back about the marvelous work the swindler has done.",

And once that event has past, the UFO fervor always dies down. It seems to function mainly as a means of distracting people with a natural sense of curiosity and an interest in government accountability from looking at more grounded developments.",

People were saying that about the hearing last November. But to people paying attention these hearings have already been happening for a couple years and are planned months ahead, so the idea that it\u2019s a distraction from a current issue is kinda silly. I agree that just because there were hearings that doesn\u2019t make the subject of those hearings legitimate. I was just making a point that just because you\u2019re only hearing about it at a certain time, usually it\u2019s been something in the works for years. For example when David Grusch testified summer before last they said it was a distraction from what was going on in Gaza at the time (or maybe Ukraine) but he had been through a long two year whistleblower process that ended with him in congress and it had been planned for months. But because it happened to come around the time of another news worthy event, it\u2019s \u201ca distraction\u201d I feel like that\u2019s downplaying something that actually has substance, people are just very closed minded on the subject.",

JDart.\n\n>It's clumsy, for sure, but it meant Mr Spiro could offer the jury here a degree of structure around what before seemed senseless: Mr Musk may have acted foolishly with the J, but he soon \"darted\", which is how you know he wasn't being serious about the allegation.\n\n>Expect the JDart \"standard\" to be applied again and again, not just in libel trials, but in any arena where social media behaviour is under scrutiny - a parachute for anyone who, in the heat of the moment, says something idiotic online.",

Did the get all the premium channels? Will this alone add up billions per year? Combine this sweetheart deal with SEC coercion to partake in DEI and we see how the leftists were destroying our country with their mafia tactics. It's far worse than we could ever imagine. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Looks like we'll all need some promethazine just to keep from barfing to death. Now, what are we going to do about  this mess? No wonder all those activist judges prevent justice from being served. While so many Americans struggle to survive every day. While these monsters turn us against each other.
