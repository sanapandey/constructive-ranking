It's not even about what he promised, it's that he handled the transition very poorly and intended to cause chaos and to shock people.  Which businesses don't like.\n\nThe stock market doesn't care as much as it should, it's in a weird meta-state where stock prices don't really reflect business fundamentals anymore.  It's more about how close the CEO is to Trump at any given moment (influence/corruption).",

Continue that cycle until the next budget.\n\nBut, and here's the thing, you have to be committed to a full court press on media.  A simple, relatable theme, common language, etc.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if we fund the government if the administration is going to illegally steal the money for its own personal projects.  It's not free money for billionaires, this is American taxpayer money that exists to provide services to the American people. The only role of a president is to execute the law, as written... and Trump has betrayed his oath and the American people too many times to trust without verification.  It isn't even clear who is president.\"\n\nAnd then just keep repeating \"It isn't clear who is president\"... like, over and over and over.\n\nThe debt ceiling was not put in place for the stupid bullshit it has been used for over the last several decades.  It was put there specifically to prevent an abusive administration.\n\nIf the administration was saving money, as claimed, it wouldn't need the debt ceiling raised.",
