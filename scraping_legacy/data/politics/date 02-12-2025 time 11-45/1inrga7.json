Instead, dominant egg producers\u2014particularly Cal-Maine Foods\u2014have leveraged the crisis to raise prices, amass record profits, and consolidate market power. The slow recovery in flock size, despite historically high prices, further suggests coordinated efforts to restrict supply and sustain inflated prices,\u201d the letter states. \n\nKey Pricing Facts:\n\nThe wholesale price of Grade-A, Large, White, Shell Eggs surged from around $0.50\u2013$1.30 per dozen in 2021 to $6.00\u2013$8.00 per dozen today.\nCal-Maine Foods, which controls 20% of the egg market, increased its gross profits by 237% between FY21 and FY24. Between FY21 and FY23, their gross profits shot up by 646%.\nCal-Maine has made more in a single quarter than they made in an entire year prior to the 2022 avian flu outbreak.\n\nKey Production Facts:\n\nIn a month-to-month comparison to 2021, the egg-laying flock was, on average, only 3.82% smaller in each month of 2022, 3.16% smaller in each month of 2023, and 5.18% smaller in each month of 2024.\nCal-Maine egg production has remained stable at approximately 1.1 billion dozen eggs sold annually from 2021 to 2024.\nPer capita production of eggs in the U.S. has not dipped below per capita consumption of eggs in any year between 2021 and the present.\n\n\nhttps://farmaction.us/farm-action-calls-for-an-investigation-into-skyrocketing-egg-prices-and-restricted-supply/",
