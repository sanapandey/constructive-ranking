Normally you couldn't, but immunity appeals always interrupt (that is true for anyone with an immunity based appeal, not just him. For example people with immunity deals for giving witness testimony etc)\n\nSo it's very unlikely you'd get through the appeal and then an appeal to SCOTUS for working out the original immunity arguments, FAST enough. It's very unlikely such appeals would ultimately succeed, because there was just one tiny little bit of the trial that included presidential term information, but the appeals wouldn't finish in time.\n\nTheoretically, they could still issue an arrest warrant while he's president, but that sounds like a great way to start a literal shootout on Pennsylvania Ave between the secret service and NY sheriffs or something (depending who he appoints to SS, FBI etc, if they get confirmed, and how corrupt they are)",

            "body": "Trump's criminal history is so extensive, that there aren't enough characters in a reddit post to sum it up.\n\nDonald Trump has been exploiting his wealth, power, and privilege to game the justice system and evade accountability throughout his entire life. He also has a habit of threatening to sue anyone who hurts his precious feelings.\n\nTrump has threatened, on several occasions, to abuse his power as president through executive actions and unitary executive privileges to seek swift retribution against his political adversaries. And this is while Trump and his supporters have the audacity to claim that it's his opponents who are \"weaponizing the justice system\" against him\n\n> In January 2023, a federal judge fined Trump and his attorney nearly $1 million, characterizing him as \"a prolific and sophisticated litigant who is repeatedly using the courts to seek revenge on political adversaries\"\n\nTrump's M.O. has always been to seek legal vengeance against his perceived enemies. He has even threatened to jail or \"go after\" his political opponents, his naysayers in the media, journalists, congressmen, civil servants, judges, \"radical leftists,\" anyone who he believes participated in stealing the 2020 election from him, and the list goes on. \n\nThen there's this nugget:\n\n> In 2016, the American Bar Association (ABA) commissioned a report to highlight Trump's excess litigation, entitled \"Donald J. Trump is a Libel Bully but also a Libel Loser\", but ***initially declined to publish it fearing being sued by Trump***\n\nMore on Trump's legal history:\n\nTrump has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of which included financial crimes, multi-million dollar real estate and tax disputes, state law violations, corrupt business practices and defamation suits.\n\nTrump has lied about his wealth for decades, and he threatens to sue anyone who dares to speculate about his actual net worth.\n\nHe is a serial fraud, con artist, adulterer and cheater. He cheats on his wives, on his taxes, he cheats at golf.\n\nDonald Trump has literally been indicted for \"defrauding The United States\"\n\nHe's been indicted for conspiring to overturn the last election, for trying to install loyalists into positions of power within the DOJ, to help *him* steal the election, but him and his supporters still claim that *Democrats* stole the election in 2020\n\nHe's been indicted for attempting to intimidate state election officials into manipulating the vote for him, he's repeatedly refused to acknowledge how Russian election meddling helped him win his first election, but Trump and his supporters claim that it's his opponents who are interfering in elections.\n\nWhat's more, he's abused his power and wealth to obstruct and delay legal efforts to hold him accountable for these crimes.\n\nHe also used his power as president to enrich himself. \n\nTrump has not only ruined or bankrupted practically every business he's been involved in, but he's consistently profited off of screwing over anyone who has had the misfortune of trusting him with their money or labor. \n\nHe has also profited off of lying about his wealth and the value of his properties his entire life, he even lied to get on the Forbes list.\n\nOver a period of time between the '80s and '90s, Donald Trump had lost more money than any other American taxpayer. His business decisions nearly led him to ruin. But he continued borrowing lots of money, particularly from his father and from banks, avoided paying income tax for many years, amassed unsustainable debts, then dumped them onto others.\n\nAs president, Trump directed taxpayer money towards his businesses. The secret service and other government parties spent exorbitant amounts of money at Trump properties and on accommodations.\n\nTrump often made foreign and domestic business deals while president. Booking events for foreign governments at Trump owned locations in order to curry favor with his admin.\n\nTrump promoted his properties while President, and hosted taxpayer funded events.\n\nHe's been indicted for obstructing the governments efforts to retrieve classified documents scattered all over his Mar-A-Lago residence, and on multiple occasions that we know of, showed those classified materials to people not authorized to view them, all while lying to the DOJ and National Archives for over a year in order to impede their efforts to retrieve those materials.\n\nAnd yes, Donald Trump has been convicted of 34 felonies involving his efforts to falsify business records in order to conceal a crime.\n\nOn more than one occasion, Trump has evaded justice by power of executive privilege and through broad immunities granted to him by a Supreme Court he helped pack with kowtowing loyalists.\n\nEvidence shows that Trump has obstructed justice on dozens of occasions. But proponents of the Unitary executive theory argue that you can't indict a sitting president. Which is exactly what Bill Barr did after Mueller found that Trump had obstructed justice ten times during the investigation.\n\nAnd again, despite all of this, Trump and his supporters claim that it's Democrats who have \"weaponized the justice system\" against Trump. The gall...\n\nDon't forget the time Trump was forced to pay more than $2 million in court-ordered damages to eight different charities for illegally misusing charitable funds at the Trump Foundation for political purposes\n\nAs part of the settlement, Trump was required to acknowledge his personal misuse of funds at the Trump Foundation and it was forced to shutter its doors and dissolve under court supervision.\n\nThen there's Trump University...\n\nIn 2013, A lawsuit was filed by New York's AG, accusing Trump of defrauding thousands of people who attended Trump University. New York regulators forced Trump to stop using the term \"university\" to describe his grifting scheme, calling Trump's use of the word, \"misleading and even illegal.\"\n\nFormer students recount being pressured to provide high approval ratings for the courses they were taking, or have their graduation certificates withheld. Thousands of students sought course refunds and claimed that they never received any benefits from the courses.\n\nThere was also a separate class action lawsuit against Trump U, Trump's counterclaims were dismissed and he even tried to file a defamation suit against one of the students who made her experiences at the \"university\" public. Trump was later ordered to pay this student's legal fees and extra costs and he was eventually found to have defrauded students and was forced to pay $25 million in restitution.\n\nHe conflates accountability with persecution because he's spent his entire life exploiting his own wealth and privilege to avoid being incriminated.\n\nMr. Law and Order everybody!\n\nHe's been held liable in civil court for sexual assault, and accused of sexual abuse, harassment or rape by dozens of women, including one of his own ex wives.\n\nHe's also indicated, on a number of occasions, that he will disregard the constitution to achieve his goals.\n\nMr. Law and Order has decided that he's entitled to broad immunities and unitary executive powers that he will use dismantle our system of checks and balances.\n\nDon't forget how him, his father, and Trump management were sued by the Justice Department for violating the fair housing act and discriminating against black renters. And after he was forced to settle, he still declared a victory.\n\nThe party of \"personal responsibility\" can't seem to take responsibility for a goddamn thing.",

That\u2019s serious because it\u2019s a direct attack on the integrity of our democratic process. If someone running for the highest office in the country can cheat the system and get away with it, what message does that send?\n\nThis isn\u2019t even Trump\u2019s first time bending the rules or dodging accountability. It\u2019s part of a pattern. Letting him off easy would say, \u201cIf you\u2019re powerful enough, the rules don\u2019t apply to you.\u201d That\u2019s not how justice should work. The law is supposed to apply to everyone, whether you\u2019re a regular citizen or a former president.\n\nJail time isn\u2019t just about punishment\u2014it\u2019s about setting an example. It shows that no one is above the law and that actions have consequences, especially when they harm democracy and public trust. This case matters because it\u2019s about more than Trump; it\u2019s about standing up for what\u2019s right and ensuring our justice system works the same for everyone.",
