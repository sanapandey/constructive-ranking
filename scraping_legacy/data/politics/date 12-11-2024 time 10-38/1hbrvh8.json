I assure you, but know I will likely fail to convince you, not all people who believe in God are like this. Perhaps, at the very least, just hear me out on these few small comments. \n\nPersonally, the impression I get is that people who bind their religion and politics the way it has been seen to happen in America very often neglect some of the most fundamental aspects of the faith, including to love one another and that ultimately (at least on my understanding) it is not up for us to judge one another, because it is not our place. \n\nPutting one\u2019s faith in an idol, as opposed to God, is also literally one of the very first of the Ten Commandments - that seems to have been completely forgotten about by this crowd who claim to staunchly defend faith and rally behind their politics. \n\nFinally, ultimately, whether an individual chooses to pursue faith is their call - that\u2019s why God leaves it to us to chase him, rather than forcing people into a relationship with Him. To enforce people into a relationship in the education system with Him undermines the entire premise of religion; a synonym for \u201cfaith\u201d is \u201ctrust\u201d, and the way I see it this is not an instance where individuals learn to develop a genuine trust in God. I also think the interaction between politics and religion is problematic in and of itself, but I\u2019ll leave this comment at that.

            "body": "*Lemon v Kurtzman*  was presented to the US Supreme Court in 1971 and asked the question: Do statutes that provide state funding for non-public, non-secular schools violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment?\n\nTo settle *Lemon v Kurtzman* the justices under Chief Burger created a three prong \u201ctest.\u201d For a law to be considered constitutional under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, the law must\n\n(1) have a legitimate secular purpose\n\n(2) not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion, and \n\n(3) not result in an excessive entanglement of government and religion. \n\nIf any prong is violated, the law is unconstitutional. \n\n*Lemon* was ultimately decided for the plaintiffs, as the government funding and the necessary financial and curriculum oversight of these religious institutions would result in \u201cexcessive entanglement\u201d with religion. \n\n________________________\n\nIn 1980, Kentucky imposed a statute that required the posting of a copy of the Ten Commandments, purchased with private contributions, on the wall of each public classroom in the State. Under Burger\u2019s court, the 5-4 majority ruled this unconstitutional. \n\nThe majority opinion is resolute: \u201cThis is not a case in which the Ten Commandments are integrated into the school curriculum, where the Bible may constitutionally be used in an appropriate study of history, civilization, ethics, comparative religion, or the like. Posting of religious texts on the wall serves no such educational function. If the posted copies of the Ten Commandments are to have any effect at all, it will be to induce the schoolchildren to read, meditate upon, perhaps to venerate and obey, the Commandments. However desirable this might be as a matter of private devotion, it is not a permissible state objective under the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, *The American Legion v. American Humanist Association* was presented before the Roberts Court. The case involved the display and maintenance of a large cross on public land (a cemetery) in Maryland. In a 7-2 decision under Roberts, the court determined the Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment clause. The majority opinion, written by Alito, states that although the cross originated as a Christian symbol, it has also taken on a secular meaning. The court further stated that when the *Lemon Test* is applied to religious symbols or monuments, the presumption should be that they are constitutional. The cross and other religious symbols and monuments therefore can be permitted if they serve a secular purpose through their historical importance beyond their admitted Christian origins. This was a new approach to evaluating establishment clause violations and is the start of our trouble. \n\nIn 2021 during the 87th Legislature, Texas passed SB 797, requiring public schools to display donated signs stating \u201cIn God We Trust.\u201d The bill (written by the same senator that crafted Texas\u2019s abortion bounty bill- SB8) is careful to point out the historical significance of the phrase, echoing language used in the *American Leigion* opinion.\n\nThe precedents the courts had previously used to evaluate violations of the Establishment clause  were crumbling and then a football coach in Washington knelt in prayer and subsequently brought it to its knees. \n\nSetting aside the fact that *Kennedy* appeared to be decided on a murky (or possibly disingenuous) understanding of the fact pattern, the 6-3 court majority took inspiration from *American Leigion* and determined whether  government action violated the establishment clause \u201cby reference to historical practices and understandings.\u201d\n\nIt is worth noting that Gorsuch was careful to soften the impact of *Kennedy* in his majority opinion- it did not use the words \u201coverturn\u201d or \u201coverrule.\u201d Instead, the use of  historical practices and understandings as the standard was specified to be \u201cin place of Lemon and the endorsement test.\u201d This word-choice surely reflects the influence of Chief Justice Roberts, who joined the majority as he prefers to overturn precedent without saying so too directly. \n\nAll that to say this-\n\nThese school prayer/10 Commandment/chaplain/religious curriculum advocacy aims to cement that \u201chistorical significance\u201d precedent, opening the door for the conservative majority court to allow any and all kind of religious iconography, provided it has a historical practice and significance. \n\nOf course, other minority religions that are practiced but do not enjoy a \u201chistorical significance\u201d in American culture will not be given this same treatment. There is only one religion that will be given preferential regard for inclusion in public buildings and forums. \n\nThe Satanic Temple is renowned for challenging laws that violate the free expression and  establishment clauses by requiring equal treatment under the law, but the \u201chistorical significance\u201d approach will prevent them from being granted the same leeway. **As there is no \u201chistorical significance or understanding\u201d of any other religion in the US to the same extent that Christianity experienced, this approach singles out Christianity as the only religion being permitted.**",
