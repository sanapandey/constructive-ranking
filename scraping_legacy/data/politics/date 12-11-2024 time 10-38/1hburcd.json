But if Trump managed to piss off 80+ million people enough in 2020 to vote for *Joe fucking Biden*, I\u2019m sure he can accomplish a similar feat in 2028 lmao.\n\nThe bigger concern is the integrity of state elections themselves and whether a future House will try to sabotage the results of those.  I\u2019m not deeply concerned about Americans\u2019 willingness to toss these R fuckers out of office in another 4 years.  I\u2019m worried about whether the electoral system by then will even *allow* them to, which is why we need to fight harder than ever to protect it.",

But nope.  \"Status Quo Joe is right, everything is perfect!\" is not the line people wanted to hear.\n\nSo we got Trump.  Not because of racism or sexism or whatever, but because he promised change.  And at this point, with the way things are, people were willing to gamble on that.  It might not be a *smart* gamble, but here we are.
