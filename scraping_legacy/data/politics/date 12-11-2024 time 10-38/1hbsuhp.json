In fact, the judge is not rejecting any potential purpose, he is simply saying that the bankruptcy trustee made a \"good-faith error\" in selling the Infowars website so quickly. The trustee should have run a longer auction process before the website was sold.\n\nThe bankruptcy trustee's error is understandable: they wanted to raise as much money from the liquidation of Jones' assets as possible, so sought a quick sale, likely on the ground that the value of a website declines quickly if it is not regularly updated. The bankruptcy judge took the view that more money could be raised from the sale of this particular asset if a longer auction was held; in effect, he took the view that by running a longer and broader auction a higher final sale price for the asset could be realised, with the gains from the higher sale price outweighing the declining value of the asset over the period of the auction.\n\nThis is a technical issue arising from the legal requirement typically imposed on liquidators to get the highest possible sale price for all of a bankrupt's assets. The judge is not rejecting the possibility of the Onion buying Infowars, he's just requiring that the government get the best possible cash outcome from Alex Jones' bankruptcy, as mandated by law.",
