I\u2019m all for gender fluidity and identifying as whatever they see fit, but making a permanent decision should be saved for adults. So I get why the government doesn\u2019t want to pay for it.",

[Here's the right one](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/in-depth/pubertal-blockers/art-20459075)\n\n\nAddressing you article, it's pretty generic and broad without making real points. Even off the bat, it says that transgenderism is temporary because there's been no long term study about puberty blockers. The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. Does this mean that vaccines didn't work before there were long term studies about them? It just means that it isn't researched enough yet. And while I do agree we should always have more research, there's been plenty of research about transgender regret, and the rates are pretty low. Less people regret transitioning than regret knee surgery. Should we not allow people to have knee surgery?\n\n\n I'm not saying every kid who thinks they are trans is trans. But there's a complete process for this. How many even go past the pronouns phase? Choose a new name? Dress as the opposite sex? This is the social transitioning phase. It requires no medication and is necessary to show for a given period of time before a doctor prescribes reversible medicine. Then that needs to go on before HRT. That needs to go on before top surgery. That needs to go on before bottom surgery. The surgeries aren't performed on minors\n\n\n\nThis also ignores that puberty blockers are well researched and have been used for awhile for cisgender kids suffering from conditions such as precocious puberty and gynecomastia. Should we stop prescribing them to cis kids, or are they only dangerous for trans kids?\n\n\nThe article then goes on to treat the side effects on the side of the box like things that will happen. Sure, the studies which they pretend never happen have found that in some cases, the risk of suicidal thoughts goes up. You know what other medication that happens for? Practically every other prescription, including those specifically created to treat depression and reduce suicidal thoughts. Plus, this is just about one formula of Puberty Blockers. Like every other medication, other formulas might work better for you.",
